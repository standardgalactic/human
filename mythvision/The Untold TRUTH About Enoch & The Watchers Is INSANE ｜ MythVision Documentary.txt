The Book of Watchers
Imagine a book so ancient it could be your history teacher's favorite bedtime story.
That's one Enoch for you.
A venerable text from the Hebrew apocalyptic genre.
It's traditionally credited to the all-star biblical figure Enoch.
Yes, the very one who was Methuselah's dad and Noah's great-grandpa.
Talk about a family tree with deep roots.
But what's inside this ancient manuscript?
It's like the ultimate supernatural expose.
If you've ever laid awake at night pondering where demons and those mysterious Nephilim characters originated,
one Enoch has some answers that could turn your nightmares into, well, slightly less scary nightmares.
Then there's the scoop on why some angels got the boot from heaven.
It's like a divine reality show where not everyone gets a halo at the end.
And if you're into biblical blockbusters, the Book of Enoch dives into the backstory of the Genesis Flood.
Spoiler alert, it's not just about a big boat and a lot of rain.
It's more like a cosmic cleanup operation with a moral overtones.
But wait, there's more.
The book also features a sneak peek into the future with a thousand-year reign of the Messiah.
It's a long-term forecast that makes your weather app look downright short-sighted.
In short, one Enoch is a mix of ancient wisdom, celestial secrets, and divine drama all rolled into one.
It's the kind of read that makes you wonder if the ancients had their own version of a blockbuster movie script stashed away in the scrolls.
Think of a time when the Enochian material was the equivalent of a bestseller outshining even the likes of Ruth and First Chronicles in the Hebrew Bible.
This was during the bustling Second Temple period around the time of the Maccabean Revolt and the Hasmonean dynasty.
It's like finding out that a deep cut from a classic album was actually a chart topper in its day.
This should tip us off to how big a deal these writings were for many folks in Judea.
But let's not get ahead of ourselves.
First, you need the lowdown on Enoch.
Enoch was basically the biblical equivalent of your great, great, great, great, great, great grandpa.
Being the seventh in line from Adam.
He had a pretty impressive run, clocking in at 365 years and then, plot twist, he was whisked away by God as per Genesis.
This was just a few curtain calls before the great flood, God's drastic measure against humanity's naughtiness.
Now here's where it gets a bit sci-fi.
Imagine divine beings coming down to earth, getting starry eyed over mortal women and resulting in a bunch of giant offspring.
It's like a crossover episode featuring characters like Hercules and Gilgamesh.
The Genesis narrative, however, is a bit stingy on details about these larger-than-life figures and their divine dads.
Flood myths are like the ancient world's version of a viral trend,
popping up in cultures far and wide, into the Enochian texts, adding layers and intrigue to this familiar plot.
In these writings, Enoch, a sort of ancient VIP, gives us the inside scoop on what led to the big flood
and even teases about the world's grand finale under a messianic ruler.
The guy had a few heavenly encounters, which makes him quite the enigmatic figure.
So when the grand tapestry of ancient tells, the Enochian texts are like those hidden gems that shed new light on well-worn stories,
making them fresh and fascinating all over again.
Let's delve into the enigmatic realm of the Book of Watchers, a mesmerizing segment of the ancient text One Enoch.
This section has long captivated scholars with its extraordinary and peculiar narratives.
Our journey through its pages reveals the descent of the Watchers, fallen angels,
whose arrival on earth irrevocably altered human destiny.
These celestial entities not only mingled with humanity, but also shared forbidden knowledge,
leading to the emergence of the Nephilim, colossal beings of unparalleled strength and voraciousness,
with legends suggesting they consumed humans and caused chaos worldwide.
As we probe further, we encounter stories steeped in dark magic and mysticism,
where the Watchers impart esoteric knowledge to humanity.
They unveil the mysteries of astrology, herbology, and spellcasting,
thus eroding the boundaries between the sacred and the profane.
This infusion of hidden knowledge plunges the world into turmoil, marked by otherworldly occurrences and ethical decay,
culminating in a scenario ripe for divine judgment and visions of apocalypse.
Our documentary navigates these remarkable aspects within the Book of Watchers,
the descent of angels, the birth of giants, the dissemination of arcane knowledge, and the ensuing heavenly judgment.
This ancient narrative provides a fascinating glimpse into early Judaic cosmology, angelology, and the foundations of apocalyptic literature.
It invites audiences to reflect on the profound influence these mythological stories have on our perception of the divine,
the monstrous, and the very nature of human curiosity and exploration.
Enoch's Mythical Roots
The figure of Enoch long-shadowed in the annals of religious history demands a closer look,
more discerning look, especially to unravel the depths of Jewish and Christian thought.
His significance, often understated, is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of the evolution of Jewish ideology during the Second Temple period.
Our conventional perceptions of Enoch and the Bible, largely shaped by subsequent developments in religious canon and scripture,
might need a serious re-evaluation.
Traditionally, distinctions between what is considered biblical and extra-biblical, sectarian and non-sectarian,
canonical and non-canonical, or even Hebrew and Greek, have dominated our understanding.
However, our exploration into Enoch's narrative suggests a more intricate tapestry of influences and origins.
Our last documentary on Enoch casts a revealing light on this enigmatic character,
drawing striking parallels with the ancient Adapa myth from Mesopotamia.
Adapa, a figure steeped in Mesopotamian mythology, was renowned for his exceptional wisdom.
Serving as a sage or priest in Aya's temple, Aya being the deity of wisdom and magic in Eridu,
one of the ancient Mesopotamians' oldest cities, Adapa embodies the archetype of the wise yet mortal man.
In some renditions of the myth, Aya is portrayed as Adapa's father or creator,
symbolizing a profound bond between the deity and his enlightened human servant.
While Aya endows Adapa with unparalleled wisdom, he does not grant him eternal life.
This aspect of the myth accentuates a crucial dichotomy, the divine bestowal of wisdom,
juxtaposed with the inherent limitations of human mortality.
Adapa's narrative, especially his celestial voyage and encounters with the gods,
mirrors the intricacies and contradictions inherent in the divine human relationship,
as perceived in Mesopotamian lore.
This backdrop provides a compelling context to re-examine Enoch's story,
hinting at a profound, perhaps previously overlooked, intercultural exchange that shaped early religious thought.
In performing his duties, Adapa found himself fishing on the Tigris River,
a violent storm provoked by a fierce wind overturned his boat.
In response, Adapa, in a fit of anger, shattered the wings of the south wind, halting its gusts for a week.
This act drew the attention of Anu, the deity who summoned Adapa to explain his actions.
However, Aya, another god, provided guidance to Adapa, advising him to win over Demusid and Giseta,
the celestial gatekeepers, and to abstain from consuming food or drink in the heavens,
claiming that such substance could be lethal.
Adapa donning a tire symbolic of grief conveyed to Demusid and Giseta that their absence had plunged the land into mourning.
In heaven, he was presented with the food of life and the water of life,
but he refused them as instructed by Aya.
He also accepted garments and oil using them as advised.
When brought before Anu, Adapa explained his refusal to partake in the heavenly banquet,
attributing his caution to Aya's counsel.
Anu, amused by Aya's machinations, rhetorically questioned what harm Adapa had inflicted upon humanity.
He then declared that human beings would endure diseases, though these could be mitigated by the goddess Ninkarak.
After this judgment, Adapa was returned to the earth.
This myth of Adapa from the old Babylonian period, circa 1894 BCE to 1595 BCE,
to the Neo-Issyrian version, dating to circa 750 BCE, introduces an exorcistic procedure.
It repeats that Adapa went to heaven and saw all its secrets, though still a human being.
He thus gained divine knowledge.
Adapa's heavenly knowledge is in vote as a means to cure disease.
His wisdom is no ordinary wisdom.
It has its source in heaven.
We could see how this myth sets up the heavenly or divine mediator myths of Moses and Enoch.
We can see Adam and Eve written all over this myth as well.
It's no coincidence that all of these figures, Adam, Enoch, and Noah, are all primordial characters existing around the beginning of creation.
Inki, aka Aya, tricked Adapa, but he did so knowing the gift of godly wisdom would have remained in heaven with the rest of the deities away from the rest of humanity,
if he would have ate the food and drink of life, which he was told would kill him.
This really makes one think about Yahweh and Adam in the Garden of Eden.
Just as Utnapishtim was separated from the rest of humanity by the gods, after being granted immortality and surviving the flood, Adapa would have suffered the same fate, and Inki knew it.
Now that Adapa has the gods wisdom, he can also come back to humanity and teach them the ways of the gods.
So just as Adapa was summoned before Anu, Adam was summoned before Yahweh to answer for their transgressions.
Both stories hint at food causing death, and both were tricked into thinking the food would kill them, one with Aya and the other with Yahweh.
We see priests in Babylon proclaim, I am Adapa, as incantations, and Judean sectarian scribes claim to have received Enoch's forms of knowledge.
These central figures, Adapa and Enoch, are mediators between the divine and mortal realm, and it was during the Persian era we see linguistic Aramaic culture dominant, with which both Babylonian and Judeans participate in.
This explains how the Enochian figure was created.
In the ancient shadows of Greek mythology, a tale as old as time itself unfolds, first chronicled by the 8th century BCE Bard Hesiod in his epic Theogony.
Here we meet Prometheus, offspring of the titan Iopetus, and either Clemeni or Asia, an oceanid.
He stands alongside his brothers Manetius, Atlas, and Epimetheus, in a lineage of mythic proportions.
Hesiod paints Prometheus as a cunning figure, daring to challenge the all-knowing, all-powerful Zeus.
The scene is set at Macomb, pivotal moment where gods and mortals negotiate their coexistence.
Prometheus' master of guile presents Zeus with a deceptive choice, nourishing beef concealed within an ox's stomach, symbolizing a valuable essence hidden by an unappealing guise and mere bones deceptively cloaked in a tantalizing fat.
Zeus, in his choice, unknowingly decrees a lasting tradition for sacrificial offerings.
Humans would feast on meat, offering only the fat-wrapped bones to the divine.
This trickery, however, incurs Zeus' wrath, leading him to conceal the secret of fire from mankind in a daring act of defiance.
Prometheus reclaims this elemental power, entrapping it within a fennel stalk to illuminate humanity once more.
This rebellion ignites further fury in Zeus, who introduces a beguiling, shy maiden, crafted from clay by Hephaestus and adorned by Athena into the world of men.
This maiden, Pandora, though unnamed by Hesiod, becomes the progenitor of a lineage that brings both delight and despair to mortal men.
For his transgressions, Prometheus endures a punishment of eternal torment bound in chains his immortal liver consumed daily by a Zeus-scent eagle only to regenerate each night.
It is not until the hero Heracles, sanctioned by Zeus, intervenes, slaying the eagle and liberating Prometheus from his perpetual agony that this chapter of mythic history finds its closure.
In the Greek myth retold by Hesiod in works and days, the story of Prometheus and the stolen fire gets even more interesting.
Zeus is really upset with Prometheus for tricking him, so he decides to hide not just fire, but also the basic things people need to live.
Hesiod suggests that if Prometheus hadn't made Zeus mad, life would have been super easy for humans.
With plenty of food and no need to work hard, we can see Adam written all over this.
In this version of the story, we also learn more about the first woman made by the god Hephaestus from Earth and Water.
Her name is Pandora, which means all gifts.
Zeus gets a bunch of other gods and goddesses like Athena, Aphrodite and Hermes to help make Pandora special, but here's the catch.
After Prometheus steals fire, Zeus sends Pandora to humans as a kind of punishment.
Prometheus' brother, Epimetheus, ignores a warning and accepts Pandora.
She comes with a jar, and when she opens it, all sorts of bad stuff like sorrow and diseases come out.
Pandora quickly closes the jar, but it's too late to stop these things from spreading.
The only thing left inside the jar is hope, because Zeus told Pandora to close it before hope could escape.
This part of the story shows that even when things are tough, there's always a little bit of hope left.
Pandora can be compared to Eve and Genesis, and you can see the punishment of diseases leading to death.
In this as well as the earlier Adapa myth, where Anu curses mankind with diseases.
In the Prometheus myth, there was a heavenly war between the Greek gods and their parents, Titans.
Prometheus, a Titan himself, uniquely managed to steer clear of the direct and cosmic clash between Zeus and the Olympians and Kronos with the other Titans.
This battle known as the Titanomachy was a defining moment in Greek mythology, marking the struggle for supremacy between the old and new gods.
Prometheus' decision to avoid involvement in this epic conflict sets him apart from his fellow Titans and played a crucial role in shaping his own legendary narrative within Greek mythology.
In addition to giving humanity fire, Prometheus claims to have taught them the arts of civilization, such as writing, mathematics, agriculture, medicine, and science.
The Titan's greatest benefaction for humanity seems to have been saving them from complete destruction.
An apparent twist on the myth of the so-called Five Ages of Man, found in Hesiod's works and days, where in Kronos and later Zeus created and destroyed five successive races of humanity.
Prometheus asserts that Zeus had wanted to obliterate the human race, but that he somehow stopped him.
And just like the Sumerian myth of Inky, or later Babylonian myth of Ea, Prometheus, the Titan from Greek mythology, may have been an influence to Enoch, as some scholars suggest.
He was also a bringer of civilization who protected humanity against the other gods, including during the Flood, as well as created man from clay.
The oldest myth from which the Ascent to Heaven motif is seen is in the figure of Etana, but we covered that in the previous Enoch documentary and can potentially cover Etana in much greater length in a future Enoch documentary or a standalone video on his myth.
I want to see comments, let me know what you would like to see.
Thanks for those comments.
If you haven't seen the first documentary on Enoch, you really should do so after this documentary.
I ask that you subscribe, hit the bell so you get notified every time I drop a new video.
These videos will go deep and cover topics that the leading scholars in the world have written about deep in the tomes of libraries.
These myths have shaped our civilizations and our imaginations, so I think it's extremely important we understand their origins and why humans wrote them.
The Book of Enoch
The Book of Enoch, also known as one Enoch, is an ancient text rooted in Jewish apocalyptic literature, traditionally attributed to the Biblical figure Enoch, the great great grandfather of Noah.
Though scholars have long realized Enoch never wrote it because Enoch didn't exist.
This work delves into the origins of demons and the Nephilim, the reasons behind the fall of certain angels, the moral justification for the Genesis flood, and prophecies about the Messiah's thousand year reign.
Alongside one Enoch, two other texts, two Enoch and three Enoch, are also ascribed to Enoch, though none are widely recognized as canonical in most Jewish or Christian denominations.
Scholarly estimates place the oldest sections of one Enoch, particularly the Book of the Watchers, around 300 to 200 BCE, with the more recent parts, like the Book of Parables, dating to approximately 100 BCE.
The original language of the text is believed to be either Aramaic or Hebrew, common languages for Jewish writings of the time.
Ephraim Isaac, a notable scholar in this field, suggests that similar to the Book of Daniel, one Enoch might have been composed in both Aramaic and Hebrew.
However, no complete Hebrew versions have survived.
The existence of various Aramaic fragments among the Dead Sea Scrolls, as well as portions in Koine Greek and Latin, demonstrate the text's historical presence among Jews and early Christians in the Near East.
Additionally, the book was referenced by some authors in the first and second centuries, including in the Testament of the Twelve Patriarchs.
Its influence extends to the New Testament, where a brief excerpt from one Enoch 1.9 is cited in the Epistle of Jude.
This particular passage, attributed to Enoch the Seventh from Adam 1 Enoch 60 verse 8, is actually a midrash or interpretive commentary on Deuteronomy 33-2.
Copies of the texts earlier sections were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.
Today, the complete Book of Enoch survives only in a translation into Ge'ez, an ancient Ethiopian language.
It is recognized as canonical by the Ethiopian Jewish community, known as Beta Israel, and the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church.
While other Jewish and Christian groups generally do not consider it canonical or divinely inspired, they often acknowledge its historical and theological significance.
In a recent article written by James Natty and Seth Sanders, a very important observation must be made as we look at Enoch.
The abstract to the article reads,
It is an urgent task of contemporary scholarship to organize the corpus in more useful new ways, free of these misleadingly anachronistic assumptions.
This issue of Metatron takes up the challenge of mapping this corpus according to different criteria, and it features a range of responses to how this collection ought to be imagined.
There was no Bible in our sense found at Qumran of a clear list of which books were sacred and authoritative.
Later, in around the 300s-400s CE, we see things like the letter of Athanasius.
Scholars like Michael Stone, James Vanderkam, and Robert Kraft have observed that the Qumran texts, which include early Jewish writings,
don't adhere to the structure or order of the Hebrew Bible as it's known today.
These texts often give precedence to other works, such as Enoch literature, which predates some of the biblical books like Daniel.
Recent scholars, including Hindi Najman, Eva Marokshe and Annette Yoshiko-Reed have furthered our understanding by challenging the traditional division between biblical and post-biblical texts,
arguing these categories are historically inaccurate.
However, to fully embrace this new perspective, academic inquiry must evolve beyond merely criticizing these outdated distinctions.
It requires a fundamental rethinking of what constitutes biblical literature, integrating it with what has been previously termed post-biblical.
If this change is confined only to the study of the Second Temple period, without affecting the broader field of Hebrew Bible studies, the old divisions will persist.
Molly Zahn's work initiates this shift by proposing new analytical frameworks and comparisons that move beyond the outdated dichotomy of biblical and post-biblical literature.
Those who shout the book of Enoch down because Enoch isn't in their Bible are just limiting their understanding of this material.
For those of the Christian persuasion, you may want to take a look at one of your cherished New Testament books that mention Enoch the 7th from Adam,
which is quoted in Jude 1.14-15.
And Enoch also, the 7th from Adam, prophesied of these, saying,
Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to convict all that are ungodly among them,
of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
Compare this with one Enoch 1.9, translated from the Ethiopic, found also in Qumran Scroll 4 Q204.
And behold, he cometh with ten thousands of his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and to destroy all the ungodly,
and to convict all flesh of all the works of their ungodliness which they have ungodly committed,
and of all the hard things which ungodly sinners have spoken against him.
The original source for the one Enoch 1.9 passage may be Deuteronomy 33.2.
He cometh with ten thousands of his holy ones.
Jude seems to clearly have used Enoch, as several scholars have long noted.
Jude even tells us Enoch is 7th from Adam, which isn't found in Genesis, but is seen in one Enoch, a much older book.
The books of Hebrews, 1 Peter and 2 Peter, also appear to contain Enoch material.
This video isn't going to waste your time trying to build a solid case, showing how the authors of some of the New Testament seem to be inspired by Enochian material.
And just as the canon isn't a fixed ordeal on what is officially known as Scripture, we will venture into the Enochian works, treating it as valuable texts,
teaching us what Judeans around the 300s BCE onward were thinking about the world.
Dr. Seth AlSander says the Enoch tradition grew in the Hellenistic period, late antiquity and middle ages.
Enoch's structure.
We know about the Jewish Torah, which consisted of five books, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy.
While there may have been some ancient drama here for your inquisitive minds,
Professor Gabriel Bococchini has postulated that two different Torahs were floating around in various Jewish communities.
Our Torah that we have in our Bibles today that centralizes Moses was one,
and the other priestly group had a Torah with Enoch as their centralized figure and a heavenly revealer.
Both groups seemed to wrestle over the Temple in Jerusalem.
Why bring this up?
The reason is that one Enoch is divided up into five sections, just like the Torah is five books.
It's possible one Enoch having five books may be anachronistic,
being the books were written in different periods.
Simply put, some scholars dispute this idea of Enoch being a competitive Torah in the earlier period
in which the Book of the Watchers and the Book of the Luminaries was scribed.
The Book of the Watchers, one Enoch, one through 36, describes Enoch's journey.
Enoch, a righteous man, has given heavenly visions.
He sees the judgment of the fallen angels and the secrets of the universe, including the workings of the stars and the thunder.
The fallen angels, this section tells the story of the fallen angels who descend to earth, marry human women and beget giants.
It describes their teachings of forbidden knowledge and their subsequent punishment.
Enoch's Intercession
Enoch acts as an intercessor between the fallen angels and God, though their plea for forgiveness is ultimately denied.
The Second Book, which is the Book of Parables or Similitudes, one Enoch 37 through 71, discusses the Messianic Kingdom.
This part contains visions of a future Messianic Kingdom, the coming judgment and the fate of the righteous and wicked, the Son of Man.
Enoch sees the Son of Man, a heavenly figure who is destined to judge the world.
The Third Book, the Astronomical Book, one Enoch 72 to 82, discusses cosmic secrets.
Enoch is taught about the movement of the heavenly bodies, understanding the order of the stars, the sun and the moon.
The Fourth Book, the Book of Dream Visions, one Enoch 83 to 90, discusses Enoch's dream.
Enoch dreams of the history of Israel, symbolized by animals.
This section allegorically covers the history from the creation to the Maccabean Revolt.
And the Fifth Book, the Epistle of Enoch, one Enoch 91 to 108, it discusses admonitions and warnings.
This part includes Enoch's admonitions to his children and warnings about the sin and righteousness with prophecies about the fate of the righteous and the wicked.
In this documentary, we will focus on the Book of the Watchers, that is, from chapters 1 through 36.
This book can be divided up into four sections to summarize the themes as such.
Introduction to the Watchers, chapters 1 through 5.
These opening chapters introduce Enoch and the context of his revelations.
It includes visions of the end of the world and divine judgment.
Enoch serves as an intermediary between heaven and earth.
The Descent of the Watchers, chapters 6 through 11.
This section narrates the story of the Watchers, a group of angels who descended to earth.
They were captivated by human women and subsequently took them as wives, leading to the birth of the Nephilim, giants or mighty ones.
Their actions disrupted the natural order, leading to widespread corruption and violence.
Enoch's Petition and Journey, chapters 12 through 16.
Enoch is approached by the fallen angels to intercede on their behalf with God.
These chapters describe Enoch's journey through earth and shield, the underworld, witnessing the punishment of the fallen angels and the spirits of their offspring.
Visions of Judgment and the Cosmic Tour, chapters 17 through 36.
Enoch receives visions of heaven in the secrets of the universe.
These include descriptions of celestial storehouses, astronomical phenomena and the workings of nature.
The concept of cosmic geography is prominent, with Enoch visiting various heavens and otherworldly realms.
The themes of divine judgment and the ultimate fate of the righteous and the wicked are elaborated upon.
Throughout the Book of the Watchers explores themes of divine justice, angelic rebellion,
the interplay between spiritual and earthly realms and the role of Enoch as a mediator and visionary.
It has been influential in shaping Jewish mystical traditions as well as early Christian thought regarding angels, demons and the end times.
The Watchers' Secrets
Here's where things get tantalizingly interesting in the Book of Watchers.
Picture this, a grand finale with an apocalyptic twist where the good guys get their just rewards, inheriting the earth no less.
While the baddies face imminent divine retribution, sounds a bit like a celestial courtroom drama with a Jesus-esque flavor, doesn't it?
But hold on, what kicked off this divine drama in the first place?
Why would a deity consider a total planetary reboot, life-wipe included, sparing only Noah and his crew?
The book isn't just spinning a yarn, it's keen on giving you the inside scoop on why that infamous flood was more than just an act of divine temper tantrum.
The rebellion begins when the sons of men had multiplied in those days.
Beautiful and comely daughters were born to them, and the Watchers, the sons of heaven, saw them and desired them, and they said to one another,
Come, let us choose for ourselves wives from the daughters of men, and let us beget children for ourselves.
And Shemi Hazar, their chief, said to them,
I fear that you will not want to do this deed, and I alone shall be guilty of a great sin.
And they all answered him and said,
Let us all swear an oath, and let us all bind one another with a curse,
that none of us turn back from this counsel until we fulfill it and do this deed.
Then they all swore together and bound one another with a curse,
and they were all of them, two hundred, who descended in the days of Jared onto the peak of Mount Hermon,
and they called the mountain Hermon because they swore and bound one another with a curse on it.
Enoch 6, 1, 2, and 7.
These and all the others with them took for themselves wives from among them such as they chose,
and they began to go into them and to defile themselves through them,
and to teach them sorcery and charms,
and to reveal to them the cutting of roots and plants,
and they conceived from them and bore to them great giants.
And the giants begot Nephilim,
and to the Nephilim were born Prusytliud plus,
and they were growing in accordance with their greatness.
They were devouring the labor of all the sons of men,
and men were not able to supply them,
and the giants began to kill men and to devour them,
and they began to sin against the birds and beasts and creeping things and the fish,
and to devour one another's flesh, and they drank the blood.
Then the earth brought accusation against the lawless ones.
1 Enoch 7, 1, 2.
Now we turn to the secrets the watchers reveal.
Asael taught men to make swords of iron and weapons and shields and breastplates,
and every instrument of war.
He showed them metals of the earth and how they should work gold to fashion it suitably,
and concerning silver to fashion it for bracelets and ornaments for women,
and he showed them concerning antimony and eye paint and all manner of precious stones and dyes,
and the sons of men made them for themselves and for their daughters,
and they transgressed and led the holy ones astray.
See, and there was much godlessness on the earth, and they made their ways desolate.
Shemihazah taught spells and the cutting of roots.
Hermani taught sorcery for the loosing of spells and magic and skill.
Barakel taught the signs of the lightning flashes.
Kokobel taught the signs of the stars.
Zekel taught the signs of the shooting stars.
Artikov taught the signs of the earth.
Shamsiel taught the signs of the sun.
Sariel taught the signs of the moon.
And they all began to reveal mysteries to their wives and to their children.
And as men were perishing, the cry went up to heaven.
Funtinok 814
Indeed, some scholars propose an intriguing theory regarding the contents of the book of Watchers,
particularly in chapter 8.
They suggest that the knowledge imparted by the fallen angels, or Watchers,
in this chapter originates from a tradition entirely distinct from that of the preceding chapter.
The previous section describes the union of mortal women with these Watchers,
a narrative rich in its own right.
This divergence in thematic content between the two chapters has led to a scholarly debate
with experts delving into the possibility that these sections draw from separate mythological or theological traditions.
The contrast between the esoteric knowledge shared by the Watchers in chapter 8
and the earlier narrative of celestial human interactions underscores the complexity and layered nature of the text.
The narrative in the book of Watchers takes a dramatic turn as it introduces a crucial moment
where the four archangels, Michael, Sariel, Raphael, and Gabriel, approach Yahweh.
They convey the dire state of affairs on earth, emphasizing the gravity of the situation.
In response to their alarming report, the most high Yahweh takes decisive action.
Yahweh dispatches Sariel with a vital mission to the son of Lamech.
Sariel's message is one of both warning and instruction.
He is to tell the son of Lamech to seek refuge, to hide himself, as a cataclysmic event is on the horizon.
This event, as foretold by Sariel, is nothing less than the end of the world as they know it,
a deluge so vast and overwhelming that it would lead to the destruction of all life
and the complete inundation of the earth.
Following this, Yahweh assigns another critical task to Raphael.
Raphael's mission, although not detailed in this segment, is implied to be of significant importance,
aligning with the overarching theme of divine intervention and the execution of Yahweh's will
in response to the corruption and turmoil plaguing the earth.
This sequence of events underscores the celestial hierarchy's active role in the unfolding divine plan
and sets the stage for further developments in this complex and richly layered narrative.
To Raphael, he said,
Go Raphael and bind Arsael hand and foot and cast him into the darkness
and make an opening in the wilderness that is in Dudael.
Throw him there and lay beneath him sharp and jagged stones
and cover him with darkness and let him dwell there for an exceedingly long time.
Cover up his face and let him not see the light
and on the day of the great judgment he will be led away to the burning conflagration
and heal the earth which the watchers have desolated
and announce the healing of the earth that the plague may be healed
and all the sons of men may not perish because of the mystery that the watchers told
and taught their sons
and all the earth was made desolate by the deeds of the teaching of Arsael
and over him write all the sins, 1st Enoch 4-8.
In a pivotal moment within the book of watchers,
Yahweh decides to take decisive action against the watchers and their offspring.
To carry out this formidable task,
Yahweh turns to Gabriel, one of the four archangels.
Yahweh's decision to intervene directly and forcefully
highlights the gravity of the situation created by the watchers and their offspring on earth.
This moment is significant as it demonstrates not only Yahweh's authority and power
but also the seriousness with which transgressions against the divine order are treated.
Gabriel, known for his strength and loyalty,
is thus chosen as the instrument of this divine retribution,
marking a key point in the narrative where celestial justice is about to get executed.
Go, Gabriel, to the bastards, to the half-breeds, to the sons of miscegenation
and destroy the sons of the watchers from among the sons of men.
Send them against one another in a war of destruction.
Length of days they will not have,
and no petition will be granted to their fathers in their behalf,
that they should expect to live an everlasting life,
nor even that each of them should live 500 years.
As the narrative in the book of watchers reaches a climatic point,
Yahweh makes a momentous decision
sending Michael the Archangel to execute a sweeping judgment.
Michael, often portrayed as the mightiest and most formidable among the archangels,
is entrusted with the grave task of bringing about total destruction to all the wicked on earth.
This act signifies a turning point in the story
where divine justice is no longer just a warning,
but becomes an active, unstoppable force.
The choice of Michael for this mission underscores the seriousness of the transgression
committed by the wicked and the extent of the response deemed necessary by Yahweh.
It's a moment that vividly illustrates the theme of cosmic justice
and the role of celestial beings as executors of the divine will.
Shaping the course of human history in the fate of the world,
Michael's role as the harbinger of this ultimate judgment
is a testament to his status and power within the celestial hierarchy.
Go, Michael, bind Shemihazah and the others with him
who have mated with the daughters of men
so that they were defiled by them in their uncleanness.
And when their sons perish and they see the destruction of their beloved ones,
bind them for 70 generations in the valleys of the earth
until the day of their judgment and consummation,
until the everlasting judgment is consummated,
then they will be led away to the fiery abyss and to the torture
and to the prison where they will be confined forever.
And everyone who is condemned and destroyed henceforth
will be bound together with them until the consummation of their generation.
Destroy all the spirits of the half-breeds and the sons of the watchers
because they have wronged men.
First, Enoch 10, 11, 15.
Did Enoch die or live?
In the ancient and captivating text of 1 Enoch starting from chapter 12,
we stumble upon a tantalizing mystery worthy of a detective novel.
The narrative hints that Enoch, the protagonist,
was whisked away before a series of extraordinary events unfolded.
The curious part? No one, not a single soul knew where Enoch had vanished to
or what fate had befallen him.
This enigma has been a puzzle for scholars and storytellers alike,
each weaving their own interpretation while some suggest Enoch was perhaps taken away
while still very much alive.
The text leaves us with more questions than answers,
inviting us into a world of ancient mysteries and divine intrigue.
Enoch, a figure shrouded in ancient mystery, lived a remarkably brief 365 years,
a mere blip compared to his long-lived contemporaries in the antediluvian world.
Intriguingly, his lifespan mirrors the number of days in a solar year,
sparking a fusion of scholarly curiosity and mystical speculation.
This numerical coincidence has led some to suggest that Enoch held the keys to a true calendar,
perfectly in sync with the solar cycle.
The enigmatic phrase, Enoch walked with God, adds to the aura of mystery surrounding him.
This phrase has opened a Pandora's box of interpretations.
Some propose that Elohim, typically understood as a reference to a single deity,
might in this context indicate a pantheon of gods or celestial beings.
This interpretation paints Enoch as a cosmic voyager,
traversing the heavens under the guidance of these celestial entities,
and in the process, acquiring esoteric knowledge, including the secrets of a solar-aligned calendar.
However, there's a more down-to-earth interpretation as well.
Some view this phrase as a metaphor for Enoch's righteous life,
a life so exemplary that it was as if he walked alongside divinity itself.
Adding to this interpretive tapestry is the Septuagint,
ancient Greek translation of the Hebrew Scriptures,
which nuances our understanding by stating that Enoch pleased God.
This subtle linguistic twist opens up a new dimension in our understanding of Enoch's relationship with the divine,
presenting it as not just one of proximity, but of active, pleasing engagement.
Each of these interpretations, celestial and earthly,
contributes to the enduring enigma and allure of Enoch's character.
The enigma of Enoch intensifies with the account of his sudden disappearance.
Central to this mystery is the repeated motif of his intimate communion with God,
culminating in the cryptic declaration,
he was not, for he was taken by God.
This phrase has ignited a spectrum of interpretations.
Notably, the theory that Enoch was elevated to heaven in a divine rapture,
an idea echoed in the story of the prophet Elijah.
Yet, there's a contrasting thread in various traditions,
suggesting that Enoch's end was, in fact, mortal.
Theories range from a tranquil passing to a demise as retribution for hypocrisy,
painting a complex picture of his final chapter.
The Septuagint, with its characteristic subtlety,
adds another layer to this puzzle by stating he was not found because God translated him.
The choice of the word translate here is intriguingly ambiguous.
It could simply signify relocation, as depicted in the book of Jubilees,
where Enoch is repositioned to Eden to serve as an eternal priest.
However, this view is muddied by suggestions of his physical death in the same narrative.
In Hellenistic Jewish philosophy, this translation might imply a more profound metamorphosis,
a shift from a tangible existence to an ethereal, immortal state.
Philo of Alexandria, an influential thinker in this tradition,
conjectured that Enoch's death was not an end, but a transformation into an incorporeal eternal being.
This concept aligns with beliefs of Enoch ascending to an angelic existence.
Interestingly, Philo extends this transformative idea to other Biblical figures like Moses and Elijah,
envisioning their physical forms evolving into pure spirit.
Adding another dimension, the book of Wisdom in the Septuagint discusses a righteous man,
presumably Enoch, who meets an early death, yet finds serenity.
This text subtly hints that Enoch's departure from the mortal world was not punitive,
but an act of divine compassion, sparing him from the moral decay of his era.
It highlights a complex interplay of life, death, and divine benevolence
woven into the enigmatic narrative of Enoch.
Enoch, sent to the Watchers.
Enoch's role in the ancient narrative takes a dramatic turn,
as he is seemingly appointed in a manner akin to that of the four archangels,
tasked with a grave and solemn duty.
He is to deliver a message of judgment to the Watchers,
celestial beings who abandon their heavenly posts
and engaged in forbidden relationships with human women.
This transgression, according to the narrative, led to their profound fall from grace.
Yahweh entrusts Enoch with a stark and unyielding message for these Watchers.
They will have no peace or forgiveness.
The consequence of their actions is severe and irrevocable.
The Watchers are condemned to witness the demise of their beloved offspring,
resulting in an endless cycle of grief and remorse.
Enoch, in his role as a divine messenger, conveys this judgment to Azael,
the leader of the Watchers, and addresses all the fallen beings collectively.
The reaction of the Watchers is one of utter terror and desperation,
realizing the gravity of their situation.
They implore Enoch to intercede on their behalf.
In a poignant display of their fall from grace,
they are unable to even speak or lift their gaze to heaven,
overwhelmed by shame for their deeds.
They beseech Enoch to draft a memorandum,
a plea for forgiveness, to be presented to Yahweh,
hoping for a chance at redemption.
Enoch takes on the role of an intermediary,
writing down each Watcher's plea.
He presents their cases individually,
a process he undertakes in the land of Dan,
located to the south of Mount Hermon.
This act of advocacy, however, is marked by a sense of futility,
as the narrative suggests that Enoch's efforts culminate in a state of exhaustion,
leading him to fall asleep.
This part of Enoch's tale underscores themes of divine justice,
the irreversible consequences of certain actions,
and the complex dynamics of intercession between the divine and the fallen.
And the vision and reprimand to the Watchers of Heaven.
Van Enoch 13.8.10.
And it begins.
The Book of the Words of Truth and the reprimand of the Watchers,
who were from of old, according to the command of the Great Holy One.
In this vision, I saw in my dream what I now speak with the human tongue
and with the breath of my mouth,
which the Great One has given to humans,
to speak with them and to understand with the heart.
As he created and destined humans to understand the words of knowledge,
so he created and destined me to reprimand the Watchers, the sons of Heaven.
I wrote up your petition, and in the vision it was shown to me thus,
that you will not obtain your petition for all the days of eternity.
But judgment has been consummated in the decree against you,
that from now on you will not ascend into Heaven for all the ages.
And it has been decreed to bind you in bonds in the earth for all the days of eternity.
And that before these things, you will see the destruction of your sons,
your beloved ones, and that you will have no pleasure in them,
but they will fall before you by the sword.
Accordingly, you will not obtain your petition concerning them,
nor concerning yourselves.
You will be petitioning and making supplication,
but you will not be speaking any word from the writing that I have written.
Enoch 1417
Enoch's journey takes on even more awe-inspiring turn,
as he ascends through the various heavens,
unveiling the grandeur of God's celestial creations.
This part of the narrative blends vivid imagery,
reminiscent of the poetic descriptions found in the Book of Job,
with its detailed portrayal of the elemental forces,
like lightning, rain, thunder, and fire,
all meticulously stored in their divine storehouses.
Additionally, there is a striking resemblance to the Book of Revelation's depiction of Jesus,
portrayed with the radiant and majestic qualities of the ancient of days,
his appearance surpassing the whiteness of snow and the brightness of the sun.
In this celestial realm,
Enoch finds himself in the overwhelming presence of the great glory,
presumably Yahweh, seated upon his throne.
This scene is painted on a canvas of unimaginable scale and splendor,
with 10,000 times 10,000 heavenly watchers or angels standing in attendance.
It's a moment that captures the essence of divine majesty and the hierarchical order of the heavens.
Amidst this grand assembly,
Enoch now referred to as the scribe of truth,
a title underscoring his role as a recorder and conveyor of divine wisdom,
is called upon by Yahweh God.
This moment signifies a profound interaction between the divine and the human,
with Enoch being asked to listen to the voice of God.
This part of Enoch's narrative not only emphasizes his unique status as a human,
who is able to traverse the heavenly realms and stand in the divine presence,
but also highlights the theme of revelation and the imparting of divine knowledge and truth.
The scene sets the stage for a significant exchange,
one that presumably imparts to Enoch and through him to humanity,
profound insights into the workings of the divine realm and its impact on the human world.
Go and say to the watchers of heaven who sent you to petition in their behalf,
you should petition in behalf of humans and not humans in behalf of you.
Why have you forsaken the high heaven, the eternal sanctuary,
and lain with women and defiled yourselves with the daughters of men
and taken for yourselves wives and done as the sons of earth
and begotten for yourselves sons, giants.
You were holy ones and spirits living forever.
With the blood of women you have defiled yourselves
and with the blood of flesh you have begotten
and with the blood of men you have lusted and you have done as they do
flesh and blood who die and perish.
Therefore I gave them women that they might cast seed into them
and thus beget children by them that nothing failed them on the earth.
But you originally existed as spirits living forever
and not dying for all the generations of eternity.
Therefore I did not make women among you.
The spirits of heaven in heaven is their dwelling
but now the giants who were begotten by the spirits and flesh
they will call them evil spirits on the earth
for their dwelling will be on the earth.
The spirits that have gone forth from the body of their flesh are evil spirits
for from humans they came into being
and from the holy watchers was the origin of their creation.
Evil spirits they will be on the earth
and evil spirits they will be called.
The spirits of heaven in heaven is their dwelling
but the spirits begotten on the earth on the earth is their dwelling
and the spirits of the giants do violence
make desolate and attack and wrestle and hurl upon the earth
and they eat nothing but abstain from food
and are thirsty and smite.
These spirits will rise up against the sons of men
and against the women for they have come forth from them
from the day of the slaughter and destruction
and death of the giants.
From the soul of whose flesh the spirits are proceeding
they are making desolate without incurring judgment
thus they will make desolate until the day of the consummation of the great judgment
when the great age will be consummated
it will be consummated all at once
and now say to the watchers who sent you to petition in their behalf
who formerly were in heaven you were in heaven
and no mystery was revealed to you
but a stolen mystery you learned
and this you made known to the women in your hardness of heart
this mystery the women and men are multiplying evils on the earth
say to them you will have no peace
but Enoch 15 to 2 to 16 to 4
Enoch's celestial odyssey continues
as he is ushered into an even more expansive realm
tasked with beholding the entirety of the creation
this segment of the narrative elevates Enoch to a vantage point view
if any humans have ever reached
allowing him to witness the intricate and profound mechanics of the universe
he has shown the treasuries of all the winds
suggesting a glimpse into the storehouses of nature's most powerful and untamed forces
Enoch also observes the very foundation of the earth
a glimpse into the core elements that constitute and stabilize our world
including its cornerstone
a symbol of the earth's origin and sustaining force
the narrative further expands into the ethereal realm
as Enoch witnesses the winds of heaven
possibly denoting the spiritual or metaphysical forces at play in the higher realms
he sees the winds of the earth
which might represent the natural and physical forces governing our terrestrial environment
Enoch is then guided along the paths of the angels
indicating a journey through the routes traversed by these celestial beings
possibly hinting at the interconnectedness of the heavenly and earthly domains
he views the ends of the earth
perhaps a reference to the farthest boundaries of the physical world
and the firmament of heaven above
alluding to the celestial dome or expanse that separates the earthly realm from the heavens
following this grand tour of the cosmos and its workings
the narrative transitions to a crucial section
that may provide insights into the origin of the fallen angel's myth
this part of Enoch's journey marks a shift from the exploration of the natural and celestial order
to the unveiling of a more complex and dramatic aspect of angelic lore
the story thus far, with its vast cosmic scope and detailed depiction of the heavenly hierarchy
sets the stage for an exploration into the more enigmatic and controversial aspects of angelic existence
and their interactions with the human world
I came and saw a place that was burning night and day where there were seven mountains of precious stones
three lying to the east and three to the south
those to the east one was of coloured stone
and one was of pearl and one was of A
and those to the south were of flame coloured stone
and the middle one of them reached to heaven like the throne of God
of antimony
and the top of the throne was of lapis lazuli
and I saw a burning fire
and beyond these mountains is a place
the edge of the great earth
there the heavens come to an end
and I saw a great chasm among pillars of heavenly fire
and I saw in it pillars of fire descending
were immeasurable toward the depth and toward the height
and Uriel said to me
there stand the angels who mingled with the women
and their spirits
having assumed many forms
bring destruction on men
and lead them astray to sacrifice to demons
as to gods until the day of the great judgment
in which they will be judged with finality
and the weaves of the transgressing angles will become syrians
beyond this chasm
I saw a place where there was neither firmament of heaven above
nor firmly founded earth beneath it
neither was there water on it nor bird
but the place was desolate and fearful
there I saw seven stars like great burning mountains
to me when I inquired about them
the angel said
this place is the end of heaven and earth
this has become a prison for the stars and the hosts of heaven
the stars that are rolling over in the fire
these are they that transgress the command of the law
in the beginning of their rising
for they did not come out in their appointed time
and he was angry with them
and bound them until the time of the consummation of their sins
ten thousand years
I, Enoch, alone saw the visions
the extremities of all things
and no one among humans has seen as I saw
verse Enoch 18 6 19 3
allow me to present a captivating ensemble
a combo of celestial custodians
known as archangels or watchers
each tasked with overseeing a distinct cosmic domain
first we have Uriel
the steward of earth in the shadowy realms of Tartarus
Raphael a guardian angel
presiding over the spirits of humanity
a role both Solomon profound
Ruel a figure of retribution
exacts vengeance upon the world of luminaries
celestial bodies embroiled
in an eternal dance of light and shadow
Michael stands as the protector of the virtuous
a beacon for the righteous souls
Sariel a watchful sentinel
oversees those spirits who dare to defy the spirit
a role demanding both wisdom and discernment
Gabriel a custodian of paradise
holds dominion over both serpents and cherubim
a role as enigmatic as it is essential
lastly we have Remiel a guide for those who rise
a role steep in mystery and awe
together these archangels form a pantheon of guardianship
each playing a pivotal role in the cosmic ballet of existence
these may be later adaptations of angels
which in earlier forms like in Genesis 6
with sons of god and earlier
let us make man in our own image
gods
this author may be writing later
which changes them from gods to angels
but their roles are very similar in the pantheon
the passage from the latter part of the book of watchers
spanning chapters 21 to 36
indeed evokes a tapestry of apocalyptic and esoteric imagery
reminiscent of the book of revelation
and the visionary accounts of an author that I read when I was younger
Mary K. Baxter with all her revelations
hell, heaven, etc.
in this segment Enoch embarks on a profound journey
traversing realms both dreadful and divine
his odyssey begins with a visit to the abode of the fallen angels
those disobedient stars now imprisoned
a stark reminder of the consequences of celestial defiance
this aspect of the narrative prompts contemplation
about the original intent of these punishments
were they exclusively meant for the watchers
or did they extend to humanity as well
the ensuing passages however seem to challenge this notion
Enoch's journey leads him to the mountain of the dead
a place of profound significance
here the spirit of Abel the first victim of fratricide
cries out for justice against his brother Cain
until Cain's lineage vanishes from the earth
this mountain as revealed by the angel Raphael
is partitioned into three distinct sections
one for the spirits of the righteous
and the other two for varying degrees of centers
these areas serve as holding grounds until the final day of judgment
where eternal curses are pronounced
linking back to the initial chapters of the book of the watchers
following this Enoch encounters the fire of the west
an unceasing inferno pursuing the celestial bodies
this element of relentless pursuit and judgment
parallels apocalyptic themes found in other religious texts
in the next scene with Michael the Archangel
Enoch is introduced to a striking vision of seven mountains
with the central one towering majestically
into a regal throne
amidst these mountains a variety of trees are present
yet one in particular captivates Enoch with its unparalleled aroma
Michael's forthcoming revelation about this tree
adds yet another layer to the mystique
and symbolism prevalent throughout Enoch's journey
these vivid descriptions and the journey's progression
weave together themes of judgment, redemption, and the cosmic order
echoing the broader narrative found in apocalyptic literature
and offering rich material for theological philosophical exploration
Enoch, why do you inquire?
and why do you marvel about the fragrance of this tree?
and why do you wish to learn the truth?
25, then I answered him
I, Enoch, and said
concerning all things I wish to know
but especially concerning this tree
and he answered me and said
the mountain that you saw whose peak is like the throne of God
is the seat where the great holy one
the Lord of glory, the king of eternity
will sit when he descends to visit the earth in goodness
and as for this fragrant tree
no flesh has the right to touch it until the great judgment
in which there will be vengeance on all and a consummation forever
then it will be given to the righteous and the pious
and its fruit will be food for the chosen
and it will be transplanted to the holy place
by the house of God, the king of eternity
then they will rejoice greatly and be glad
and they will enter into the sanctuary
its fragrances ay in their bones
and they will live a long life on the earth
such as your fathers lived also in their days
and torments and plagues and suffering will not touch them
1, Enoch, 24, 6, 26, 6
as Enoch's journey continues
he is led to behold Jerusalem
depicted as the center of the earth
a place intertwined with themes of divine justice and punishment
this part of his vision is presented by Sariel
an archangel who embodies the gravitas of such a significant locale
the depiction of Jerusalem in this context
aligns with its emblematic role in many religious traditions
representing a nexus of spiritual and earthly matters
following this, Enoch's odyssey takes a transformative turn
as he is ushered into the paradise of righteousness
this utopian realm contrasts sharply
with the earlier scenes of judgment and retribution
here he encounters the tree of wisdom
a symbol rich in meaning and resonance
this tree from which the holy ones partake
to gain profound wisdom embodies the pursuit of knowledge
and the divine enlightenment that follows
Enoch's reaction to the tree, particularly noting its beauty
explores the allure and significance of spiritual insight
Gabriel, another archangel of great renown
accompanies Enoch in this segment of his vision
Gabriel's presence and forthcoming commentary
add depth to the narrative
offering insights into the nature of the celestial paradise
and the tree of wisdom
his words are likely to reveal further layers
of spiritual understanding and symbolism
tying together the themes of knowledge
righteousness and divine revelation
this journey is described in the latter chapters
of the book of watchers is rich in symbolic imagery
and theological themes
it mirrors the human quest for understanding
contrasting the consequences of sin
with the rewards of righteousness
and intertwines the earthly with the divine
offering a complex tapestry of spiritual exploration
the archangel Gabriel says
Enoch's journey is narrated in the book of the watchers
is indeed a profound and expansive exploration
that takes him to the farthest reaches
in the very extremities of the earth
his travels are not just physical but deeply spiritual
and symbolic traversing the entirety of creation
north, west, south and east
each direction offers its own revelations and experiences
contributing to the overarching narrative of divine judgment
wisdom and the cosmic order
this odyssey to the four corners of the earth
embodies a quest for understanding the divine plan
and the nature of the universe
it's a journey that transcends the literal
venturing into realms of metaphysical
significance and spiritual introspection
Enoch's experiences along the way
from witnessing the fate of fallen angels
to the paradise of righteousness
encapsulate a broad spectrum of theological
and eschatological concepts
the culmination of Enoch's journey
with a blessing to the lord of glory
serves as a fitting conclusion to the book of the watchers
this act of reverence and acknowledgement of divine sovereignty
is a profound affirmation of Enoch's experiences
and the lessons learned throughout his journey
it reflects a deep sense of humility and devotion
recognizing the overarching power and wisdom
of the divine as the author sees fit
the book of the watchers therefore
is not just a narrative of celestial journeys
and apocalyptic visions
it's a rich layered text that offers
insights into ancient beliefs about angels
the cosmos and the relationship between
divine and humanity
Enoch's travels and the revelations he receives
are a testament to the enduring human quest
for understanding the mysteries of existence
and the divine plan
one more note about the history of the book of Enoch's
acceptance and rejection
in various religious traditions
and it's a complex and fascinating subject
from the Jewish perspective
the book of Enoch, despite its rich narratives
and influence on early Jewish thought
was ultimately excluded from the formal canon
of the Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible
and the Septuagint, Greek translation of the Hebrew Bible
this exclusion also led to its absence
from the Deutero canonical books
which are accepted in some Christian traditions
but not in the Jewish canon
the primary reason for its exclusion from the Jewish canon
is the inconsistency of its teachings
with those of the Torah
the central reference of Jewish law and theology
in rabbinic Judaism, the book is often viewed as heretical
a notable example of this inconsistency
is the mention of the angel Phaniel
in 1 Enoch 41-10
Fanuel, not found in other scriptures
is described as presiding over repentance
and eternal life
some interpret this as a reference to Jesus Christ
particularly given that Fanuel
translates to the face of God
which would be in direct conflict
with mainstream Jewish teachings
additionally the textual nature
of early sections of the book of Enoch
which appear to reinterpret
or expand upon material from the Torah
such as 1 Enoch 1 being a midrash
of Deuteronomy 33
might have contributed to its rejection
the detailed accounts of fallen angels
topic that was contentious
and seen as inconsistent with the perceived sanctity
of God's utterances
further fueled its exclusion
this perspective is exemplified
in the debates between Trifo the Jew
and Justin Martyr
where Trifo criticizes the Christian interpretations
of such texts
the Christian perspective
in early Christianity
the status of the book of Enoch varied
by the 5th century
it was mostly excluded
from Christian biblical canons
however it was considered scripture
in the epistle of Barnabas
and revered by many early church fathers
including Athenagoras
Clement of Alexandria
Irenaeus
and Tertolian
around 200 AD
Tertolian argued that the book of Enoch
had been rejected by Jews
because it contained prophecies about Christ
which is a reflection of the
divergent views on this text
between Jewish and Christian communities
the book of Enoch's influence on
early Christian thought is undeniable
but its eventual marginalization
in the mainstream Christian canon
reflects the complex processes
of early Christian formation
and the differing theological priorities
of early Jewish and Christian communities
