This is very important. I want to get this I want to get this on video and on tape
You know that Scientology
from the level of ot3 to ot8 is
Exorcism of
attached
What they call body things a thing is a spirit and a body thing is a spirit
attached to your body
or even
attached to you and
This is all contradictory because a spirit supposedly is not even located. I
Wanted to actually
Tell you what the commands are and what Tom Cruise
are after are after are after are has done
To expel or jettison his body things
That's never it's never ever been
Ed anywhere anytime any place the first step is to locate this attached spirit
so the question is
you're on the meter and
The question is
Where are you and
The body Titan raises his hand spiritually and says I'm in your nose and
Then you say thank you
And the next question is what are you you're asking the spirit
To look and examine
What he's being
He could be being a nose, but he could be anything else. I'm your sadness. I'm your
Surgery you had when you were five years old. He's being whatever he's being and
telepathically the attached spirit
Answers the what question
till you get a certain immediate phenomena and
Then telepathically this spirit in the nose is asked
That was a fake identity. That was that was that was that was not a true idea
who are you and
The spirit
Has to come up with the answer me. I am myself
at which point
the spirit
Realizes he doesn't need to be stuck in the nose and vanishes and
The jettison
Expelling exorcism is done
That's what Tom has done for hundreds of hours
Looked at his body
found the body Peyton
Asked, what are you? Who are you?
till the body Peyton vanished
That's
Weird
Honestly, I that's just really strange. I've never heard anybody do that kind of stuff
I mean, I imagine maybe like a palm reader trying to figure something out or like a ghost hunter
I could see trying to do that, but that's really strange practice
