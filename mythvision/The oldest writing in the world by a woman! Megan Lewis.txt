all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Megan Lewis welcome back once again I'm excited to hear what you have to say
about this because I heard it before somewhere the oldest known writing of any woman in history
we we have no older data that women have wrote tell us about this lady and what is what is
it where is it yeah so the earliest female author that we know of is a priestess called
anhe duana and she was the daughter of salwan the great of akkad who was the first person
to unite northern and southern respite amia he created the first world empire and he
installed his daughter anhe duana in the high priestess ship of the city of or so she was
the high priestess of the moon god sin but a personal kind of devotee of the goddess ishtar
and the writings that we have from her are hymns and poems to the goddess ishtar extolling
her her virtues and her glory and and how great and magnificent she is and they're really
really cool essentially I will have a like put a quick caveat in here all of the copies
of these texts that we have come from a much later time period they're all attributed to
anhe duana but we don't have anything like that she wrote in her hand essentially so
it can be debated whether or not she did actually compose these but for me even if historically
she didn't put stylus to quite as it were the fact that she's remembered by later traditions
as having written this quite extensive corpus for for one individual is actually really
really interesting because it tells us that a women could write to be that it was considered
socially acceptable for them to write which is is fascinating and we see also so anhe
duana was in like 2300 BCE very roughly I'm not great with dates so I'm I'm rounding
to give you a rough idea about yeah well later millennium okay but so she's a priestess
and a princess so obviously very wealthy very high social status so her being educated isn't
isn't terribly surprising if you think about it we have other princesses other priestesses later
in Mesopotamian history who write to do their own kind of accounting keep their own records so
that's that's not wildly surprising anhe duana is particularly cool because she's the first
like literary author but you also have in I think around 2600 BCE you have evidence for
women of a non-royal class so merchant women so still wealthy not as wealthy not as high up in
the social standing but women who could write and could read so this is from a city in Turkey
what was then or what is often referred to as Anatolia so in southern Turkey a city called
Karnesh there was a a merchant colony of Assyrian traders so Assyria is like northern Mesopotamia
they traveled up to Karnesh they brought with them tin and textiles and they trade them for
silver and then send the silver back down south to to Mesopotamia and this goes on for a while
in a couple of generations and ultimately what you have is the men of a family going up settling in
Karnesh like staying there and running that side of the business and then their wives are staying
home in Assyria with their children running their own areas of expertise they were the ones generally
who oversaw the weaving made the textiles that their husbands then took up to Anatolia but what
we have are letters from these women that they send to their husbands about business matters
but often asking them when are you coming home you haven't been to the temple in years you have to
come and pay respects to your god you need to come home and take care of your children there are
things we have to do that we can't do without you like rituals and ceremonies marriage specifically
we need you to come home so those are I mean they're fascinating because it provides a really
nice kind of window into personal life in Mesopotamia and we often don't have a lot of that much of
what we have historically not just from Mesopotamia from Egypt as well much of what we have is like
royal official court documentation which is interesting just in its own right but it doesn't
often give you very much of an idea of how people like you and I would have lived so these letters
really give that that kind of insight and they're made even more interesting for me by the fact that
the men who went up to Karnesh quite often would marry local Anatolian women and maintain separate
families from their like original Assyrian family so yeah interesting stuff. The men were just I
guess in in the society women seemed to have had a higher value at least than what you would see
typically biblically speaking in a patriarchal science it's somewhat patriarchal. It's definitely
still patriarchal women are still under the control under the purview of a specific man be it their
husband their father their brother their uncle the way you kind of see women working around this
when they enter the the enter religious service and enter the priesthood then often they have a
bit more freedom and you do see priestesses owning their own land and stuff like that but no generally
speaking women in Mesopotamia were closely closely tied to a familial male figure but they do also
have certain freedoms that you wouldn't necessarily expect maybe women typically are in charge of things
like breweries they own pubs that's like not a male dominated thing that the women own the pubs
and you see that in the epic of Gilgamesh if you've ever read through it when Gilgamesh comes to the
end of the world there's a pub there because I mean why wouldn't there be and the tavern keeper is a
female and that's just all of them as far as I'm aware that we have record of they're all women
so women they brew the beer they're in charge of the taverns they're in charge of things like textile
weaving which doesn't like seem like that bigger thing but it's a massive financial
aspect of family life and they're often like in charge of the house and that like when you say
they're in charge of the house that doesn't seem all that important but that means they're in charge
of things like day-to-day finances and making sure that the family business runs correctly while
their husbands are away doing whatever it is husbands do and like managing like did I say
managing accounts I feel like just money yeah but like generally managing everything and that's
that's a pretty big responsibility hmm sounds like you could argue and and I'm bringing this to the
bible just to smidge to say like in proverbs the proverbs 31 woman is kind of doing the managing
going to the gates and things so there could be something there uh but can you tell us a little
bit of the drama a little more about that because who doesn't like to hear about the drama the wife
is writing and did do they even know to some of them in the do we have evidence I mean the best
way to ask is do we have evidence of some of them knowing that they have another family somewhere
else so it's been a while since I looked at the letters but I think they all knew I think that
would be a pretty difficult thing to hide and I'm very willing to be wrong but I'm pretty sure that
they they knew and like it's not I don't imagine anyone was particularly thrilled with the situation
but I don't think it would be terribly surprising um because this is something you see culturally
throughout that region in this historical period and I mean you see it in the bible Abraham has two
wives and then he he has sex with his wife's handmaid and like it happens yeah like it's it's
legal it's socially permissible for that kind of thing um I think the and I'm not a legal expert
but I believe that the legality gets um it gets interesting because I believe the man has to make
sure he can provide for his original family um and if he can't then then he runs into trouble
um but no I don't think it would have been a secret wow uh and you said that they would write
stuff like hey we need some money yeah yeah so the women so like I said them the weaving the textiles
they're going by donkey up to Anatolia which is like a long way it's it's not close which is why
these men had to go up and stay there essentially for years at a time because it it took several
months to travel back and forth um so they'd send up the textiles they'd send up the letters um and
because they're in charge of things like essentially running the house running the family
in an ass or while their husbands are away they need money for food they need money for oil um
just keeping their life going repairing the house and they're also the point of contact for any
business associates still in Assyria so you've got people coming to their door demanding that they
pay their debts or their husband's debts um so these women are obviously writing to their husband
saying look you didn't send us enough money I've got this guy coming at me for money for
god knows what I need to buy more oil we don't have any um any grain left and we don't have
any flour left you need to send more money down final thing um in some of these letters you brought
up in the past video that we somehow magically lost that um they might mention stuff like this guy's
harassing us yeah now have there been any letters where it's gone further and then more detail in
saying like this guy took advantage of me or like uh there's been like real serious situations occur
that you know of I honestly don't know um it's an interesting question though just because
I mean men are more like especially in antiquity I suspect are more physically and even today we
could see this happen like their size is different but that men might take advantage of the fact that
they know the husband's out of town and they're taking advantage of the situation I kind of wonder
if there's some like sneak peek window into some of this I don't know that's a really good question
I have to read the letters again and have a look I just look at the world around today it's like if
you look around you can see it happens all the time today why wouldn't it have happened in antiquity
especially when the husband's been gone for years and he has a whole family he's got some world
this woman here has nobody and or at least other than the kids that she's raising
made me think maybe that's something there I don't know thank you of course
um
