In the shadowy corridors of ancient religious history, a provocative mystery unfolds.
One that challenges the very nature of divinity, as presented in today's mainstream Judeo-Christian
beliefs.
What if the God of the Bible, often thought of as an omnipresent spirit, without form,
actually had a body?
This startling concept is not as far-fetched as it might seem.
Like the deities of Egypt, Akkad, Ugera, and Phoenicia, the Biblical figures El and
Yahweh were once envisioned in a form astonishingly human.
Imagine a deity not bound by ethereal abstraction, but one who speaks,
walks, and interacts with the physical world, a God who breathes life into clay to create
mankind, who debates with Abraham and who meets Moses face to face.
This was a God who wasn't just an omnipotent force, but a being with a personal story,
familial ties, and a vivid presence among his followers.
But a pivotal shift occurred, a transformation so profound that it redefined the essence
of this divine figure, which led to the evolution of the incorporeal, mysterious deity worshipped
today.
Why did ancient Israelites, who once depicted their God in tangible, relatable forms, suddenly
enforce a prohibition against such images?
The commandment, you shall not make for yourself a carved image, marks a significant theological
evolution from a visible to a hidden God, which eventually became an invisible one.
This documentary will delve into the fascinating journey of the God of the Bible, once physically
depicted and actively participating in human affairs, transcended into the abstract, unseen
deity of modern faith.
We will explore ancient texts, archaeological discoveries, and theological debates that unveil
this enigmatic transformation.
Was the hiddenness of God a deliberate theological advancement or a response to evolving religious
and social landscapes?
Uncover the profound implications of these questions in a quest that not only revisits
the forgotten physicality of Yahweh, but also challenges the very foundation of how we perceive
the divine.
Be ready to uncover the lost body of God, a journey that will redefine the boundaries
of faith and history.
Recovering God's Body
If you really want to trigger people, and I mean seriously, upset some, talk about the
obvious appearances of God in the Bible, having a physical body similar to Mesopotamian deities
like Shamash, Egyptian gods like Amunre, Hittite deities, Ugaritic gods like El, that God's
name sounds familiar.
Talk about this male god having battle-ready hands, strong and sturdy feet sitting on an
actual massive heavenly throne, a mighty warrior's voice, a beautiful masculine face with a glowing
beard piercing fierce eyes, with organs that fill all the emotions we do, but on a heightened
scale, a powerful penis used to produce godly offspring with his consort, Asherah, and you
will have swarms of the devout fundamentalist with theological towers of Babel built with
their real daddy Plato's philosophy, forcing them to speak one language.
Take my word, my last documentary on the real God of the Bible, highlighting Francesca
Stavrakapoulou's book, God and Anatomy, really brought out the best in zealous Bible believers
and being sarcastic.
Seriously though, many disgusting derogatory words flew out of many online apologist's
mouths, suggesting this as anti-Semitic, no apologist.
This is anti-theology in all its glory, we are not only going to show you God's body
in all its anthropomorphic splendor, but we're coming to the defense of Francesca Stavrakapoulou
from sensitive fundies grossed out that God has portrayed in their sacred texts in ways
they prefer to ignore or close their eyes and shout, be gone in the name of Jesus.
We will bring several academics with similar observations to the table on this matter to
show you this God.
They would prefer us to pretend that this God is so alien to all other deities from
all other cultures, even the ones in Ugera who literally have the same God L as their
chief deity.
I'll take 1000 for Israelites or Canaanites, it's my duty to come to the defense of serious
academia on this matter because we want the facts, we want the truth, even if some can't
handle the truth.
You want answers?
I think I'm entitled.
You want answers?
I want the truth!
You can't handle the truth!
Just maybe this wake-up call of a documentary will help people understand why scholars
see God in the Bible as being so human-like as all other gods in these regions.
This idea of God having a body, head, feet, arms, penis, wife and all is not a fringe
idea among scholars of the Hebrew Bible.
Some have cried, whoa, to some of Dr. Stavrakapoulou's interpretations of God like in Isaiah
6.
She suggests that the text is describing God's enormous phallus, building the temple.
These triggered cries from online would have you believe she is defeated because some other
scholar may disagree or not be completely on board with this particular interpretation.
Far from it.
May I remind you, the gods of all surrounding cultures, including the culture from which
the Israelites and Judeans arose, have gods performing sexual acts all the time.
The problem isn't with pointing out the obvious in these ancient texts, it's with us and
our sensitivities from being willing to admit they are there and this God isn't off-limits
either.
We will share other voices from serious scholars in the field along the way.
If you'd like to dive deeper into this project, you might find the work of Dr. Andreas Wagner
along with Dr. Esther J. Hamori, Dr. Benjamin D. Sommer, and Dr. Christoph Marski's.
Very useful as a foundation for this project.
For a long time, nobody wanted to see and observe the anthropomorphic facts found in
the Old Testament, but they are simply too numerous and too obvious to be overlooked.
The Old Testament texts outline an anthropomorphic body image of God.
We have to understand that in the Old Testament, the prohibition of images meant the prohibition
of statues, not the prohibition of ideas about the image and body of God, Chapter 2.
We also have those who cheer us on from the crowds because they too are on a pursuit of
truth and discovery of facts.
They see through the theological blanket, covering God's body from visibility.
This video is dedicated to you, my friends, and those sincerely journeying to understand
the context of the biblical portrait of God.
For every picture in the Bible that makes God look and act like humans, there is a theological
trick to get out of this pickle.
Does God repent?
Yes.
And no.
And the Lord was sorry that he made man on the earth, and he was grieved in his heart,
Genesis 6, 8.
And God is not a man that he should lie, neither the Son of man, that he should repent, hath
he said, and shall he not do it, or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good, Numbers
23, 19.
Does God know all things?
Yes.
And no.
For whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything,
1 John 3, 20.
And, but the Lord God called to the man, Where are you, Genesis 3, 9.
Did Moses see God face to face?
Yes, and no.
Moses saw God, but not just his back parts.
The Lord would speak to Moses, face to face, as one speaks to a friend.
Exodus 33, 11.
However, Jesus says, No one has seen God but him.
No one has ever seen God, but the one and only Son, who is himself God, and is in closest
relationship with the Father, has made him known, John 1, 18.
In the introduction of Dr. Somer's book, The Bodies of God, he starts off with a bang.
The God of the Hebrew Bible has a body.
This must be stated at the outset, because so many people, including many scholars, assume
otherwise.
The evidence for this simple thesis is overwhelming.
So much so that asserting the carnal nature of the biblical God should not occasion surprise.
What I propose to show in this book is that the startling or bizarre idea in the Hebrew
Bible is sometimes else entirely not that God has a body that is the standard notion
of ancient Israelite theology, but rather that God has many bodies located in sundry
places in the world that God created.
Some need not go very far into the Bible.
To find a reference to God's form or shape, both terms, in fact, appear in the 26th verse
of the Bible, in which God addresses various unnamed heavenly creatures as follows.
Let us make humanity in our form, according to our shape, so that they rule over the fish
of the sea, and the birds in the sky, and the beast over all the earth, and all the
creeping things that creep on the earth, Genesis 1.26.
This verse begins from the assumption that God and the unnamed heavenly creatures have
bodies, and it tells us that human bodies will have the same basic shape as theirs.
As this verse plays an important role in chapter 3 of this book, I do not address it at length
here.
Suffice it to say that the verse makes clear that human and divine bodies have the same
contours, but it does not say anything about what the respective bodies are made of.
Is it made of some type of material?
Is it distinctly made of light, which is why it needed to be surrounded by dark clouds
in some contexts?
There's Dr. Sommers on the right track about different types of bodies of God, and how
this idea seems to change over time, even within the Bible.
But one thing is for sure, God never stops having an actual body, until later philosophy
spoils the fun.
We have clear text which suggests God had a form in a material physical sense, while
other times it points to a non-material anthropomorphism, and after a powerful introduction showing
God in very detailed descriptive ways as being at certain places, at certain times, with
what appears to be an actual body, Dr. Sommers makes a jab at the field.
To these examples, one could add copious evidence from narrative, prophecy, and Psalms, many
of which are examined in detail in chapter 2 and 3.
In light of these texts, it is surprising that many scholars ignore, or even deny, the
corporeality of the biblical God.
Others acknowledge the evidence, but attempt to minimize it, or to claim that it is to
be understood only symbolically.
This may be one of the reasons he felt it necessary to write his book.
I strongly suggest you pick up a copy of this work.
To tease you of the backing of the process done by Dr. Stavrakapulu's book From Dr.
Sommer, listen to what he has to say and tell me it doesn't pique your interest.
To achieve the first of these goals, it is necessary to place the biblical documents
into their cultural, ideological, and theological contexts.
When we examine biblical texts from within their own world, the world of the ancient
Near East, we can notice crucial aspects of these texts that were clear to their original
audiences but seem hazy or completely invisible to our much later eyes.
What I have to say about the Hebrew Bible in this book is based on models drawn from
texts written by the Mesopotamian and Northwest Semitic peoples who were the ancestors and
neighbors of the ancient Israelites.
Therefore, Chapter 1 treats texts and artifacts from outside ancient Israel.
I imagine many readers came to this book to find out what it has to say about Hebrew
Scripture.
And some of those readers may be tempted to skip my discussion of Akkadian, Ugaritic,
Venetian, and Aramaic material in Chapter 1 so they can instead go straight to the discussions
of biblical texts that follow.
I beg you not to do so.
Nothing I say about biblical texts in Chapter 2 and 3 will be convincing unless those texts
are read alongside their close cousins from Babylonia, Assyria, and Canaan.
What I attempt to do in this book is to recover a lost biblical theology.
To find what has been lost, we need to enter a specific thought world.
The door into that thought world is located in Mesopotamia, to which we now turn.
He then goes on to break down divine fluidity in the cultures where the biblical traditions
arose, then to the biblical deity.
But one thing is for sure.
We can thank the scribes we call P and E for redacting or changing certain ideas about
how God interacted with His worshipers.
What I'm getting at is simply the Bible isn't one book telling one story that is univocal,
one voice.
Each book needs to be taken as its own author with their own agenda and ideas.
Scholars have noticed ideas in these Hebrew Bible texts, which may date back to the 8th
century BCE, all the way down to the 2nd century BCE.
This brings us back to Francesca's God and Anatomy, where she describes her experience
as a child coming across an illustrated children's Bible, having Abraham about to sacrifice his
son Isaac by tying him up, ready to pierce the knife through his skin and burn him to
Yahweh, thanks to the angel for stopping it.
She recalls an old man carrying two stone slabs, with laws given by God on a mountain, as well
as another old man being taken by God on a fiery chariot, moved by horses pulling it,
ascending to heaven.
She describes Jonah tangled up with seaweed inside of a giant well and then goes on to
articulate Jesus, laying in a bed of hay after being born by Mary, the image of a woman
dancing in front of John the Baptist's head on a shiny platter.
Tied up was Jesus on a big wooden cross, beaten and bloody.
And while she never believed in God, she seemed to always have been fascinated by religion
and family trips to museums really made these ancient religions tangible.
She says, giant stone statues of gods, rounded, fleshy and powerful.
Gods draped in tunics and wearing sandals, gods with toenails, elbows, eyebrows.
In other rooms, there were brightly painted coffins with bodies wrapped in strips of dirty
fabric, surrounded by gods with the faces of animals, a cat, a dog, a bird, a crocodile.
Turn a corner and there were more gods, this time carved on tiny polished stones.
Looking on thrones and long skirts with horns on their crowns and monsters at their feet.
In museums, I learned that the deities of Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece and Rome were the
gods of the wider world in which the Bible was made.
But where were the statues of the God of the Bible himself, the only deity among them to
survive into the modern day?
Her experience in some ways was mine, because she accurately described this strange enigma
from theology students who believed God doesn't have a body, God was formless, imageless and
invisible, only becoming physical in human form through Jesus on earth, or a brief 33
year period, only to return to heaven out of sight.
She continues, But as I looked closely at the books comprising
the Bible, I couldn't find this bodyless God, instead, these ancient texts conjured
a startling caporial image of God as a human shaped deity who walked and talked and wept
and laughed, a God who ate and slept and felt and breathed, and a God who was distinctly
male, as my undergraduate studies progressed, no one seemed to talk about the body of the
biblical God.
Until one memorable lecture, when the gender politics of modern Christian theology were
being discussed, I was excited to discover that feminist theologians had long taken issue
with the maleness of God in their scriptures, and yet, it soon transpired that the way in
which both feminist and traditional theologians proposed getting around this sticky issue
was to insist that God couldn't possibly have a sex or a gender, because God didn't
have a body.
I vividly recall protesting in the question and answer session at the end of the lecture,
but lots of biblical texts suggest that God is masculine with a male body.
The problem isn't God, replied the professor, a highly respected Christian theologian and
a man of the cloth.
The problem only arises when we take the Bible's descriptions too literally.
You went on to explain that those troublesome biblical portrayals of a caporial masculine
God were simply metaphorical or poetic.
We shouldn't get too distracted by references to his body, he said.
To do so, he exclaimed, was to engage too simplistically with the biblical texts.
Apparently, we had to look not just at the text, but through the text, to engage their
theological truths.
This is exactly what the theological mobs online expect us to accept.
But just as Francesca wasn't appeased, neither are we.
We know that there is much more being missed, and along with her words, we also think.
Why should I look past the clear image of God as a gigantic man with a heavy tread,
weapons in his hands and breath as hot as sulfur, a God who took on monstrous sea dragons
in a physical fight, and won, a God who walked about in his heavenly garden and in the cemeteries
of his people?
A God who stripped a woman naked and offered her up to be gang mutilated?
A God who sat on a throne in a temple, enjoying the aroma of scorched animal fat as he waited
for his dinner?
A God who not only had children, but who willingly and willfully offered up his beloved son
to be killed as a sacrifice?
How could I not be distracted?
Here was a deity just like those I'd visited in museums as a child.
A God of ancient myths, fantastic stories, and long lost rituals.
A God from the distant past, from a society utterly unlike our own.
Those were the terms on which I wanted to encounter him.
Not as a distant and abstract being, but as the product of a particular culture at a
particular time.
Made in the image of the people who lived then, a God shaped by their own physical circumstances,
their own view of the world, and their own imaginations.
We want to resurrect this fossil of a God we find in the Bible to analyze him for what
he actually looks like.
It's a fascinating thing to observe how believers have theorized this deity away over time,
with heightened abstract philosophical attributes.
Even critics of Christianity and the faithful are trapped, arguing this theoretical perception
of God, instead of going to the clear ink of the texts throughout the Bible describing
God very human-like.
As if some revelation occurred, Francesca says, and then it suddenly dawned on me.
Everyone else in the room, my theology professor included, was censoring the Bible, sanitizing
its deity of any mythological, earthly, or unsettling characteristics.
I was disappointed by them, and disappointed for them.
This is the book I'd have liked to read when I was at university.
It tells the story of the real God of the Bible in all his corporeal, uncensored, scandalous
forms, stripping away the theological veneer of centuries of Jewish and Christian piety.
This book disentangles the biblical God from his scriptural and doctrinal fetters to reveal
a deity wholly unlike the God worshiped by Jews and Christians today.
The God revealed in this book is the deity as his ancient worshippers saw him, a supersized,
muscle-bound, good-looking God with supra-human powers, earthly passions, and a penchant for
the fantastic and the monstrous.
The body is the same for humans as for God.
How do we unlearn the layers of dogma in order to see God in his ancient Near-Eastern context
rather than endlessly playing philosophical and theological gymnastics?
My own experience tells me that it is going to take each person to give these ideas a
chance.
The best thing we can do is listen to the observations, consider whether we made God
into our own theological and philosophical image, and try to see how everyone else viewed
their deities in the world God grew up in.
It's actually unfortunate that theology has muddied the waters for researching the God
of the Bible in its original context.
Thanks to Hellenism, coupled by the Greek philosophers, Jewish and Christian sensitivities
to images of God was heightened.
In effect, over time, this made an entirely new version of God, which is completely foreign
to the Old Testament.
We desire to start fresh, without theological anachronisms telling us.
Being made in the image of God doesn't actually mean humans look like God and God looks like
humans in a visual form.
The biblical text will paint a verbal picture for us.
All we have to do is try to visualize what it describes.
Often, the language describing this God has so much overlap with other ancient Near Eastern
examples.
It becomes necessary to bring those up just to show you very clear ways to situate what
the Bible appears to be saying and visualizing for us.
The evidence isn't limited to verbal images and text.
We can also look to material images, such as drawings and statue depictions, as Dr.
Andreas Wagner suggests in their book, God's Body.
We will rely heavily on that book throughout this documentary.
Material images reveal clearly how the external form was seen in the ancient Orient and in
Old Testament times.
Thus, they are particularly suitable as source material for the concept of the figure and
for understanding the depicted body.
The characteristics of material depictions converge well with those verbal images.
While we have limited material images for this God, we do have some.
We can also see how particular culture views the figure and body, which will help us see
the perception of the human figure of God.
Simply put, the ancient believed man was made in the image of God.
One could technically learn what the cultural understanding of man is, then imagine God
reflects their perception.
In a gist, this is what Dr. Wagner suggests.
A, understanding ancient art and images from the Old Testament era requires diving into
their unique visual culture, which differs significantly from ours.
We need to appreciate how people in the past viewed images, which can be quite different
from how we see them today.
In our world, we are bombarded daily with countless images from TV, movies, ads, and
art, all presented on flat surfaces like screens and paper.
This overload influences our perception, yet we rarely think about how we've learned
to interpret these two-dimensional images as three-dimensional ideas in our minds.
It's important to recognize that not all images require complex thought to understand,
as some are designed to simply evoke emotional responses.
We should avoid overly criticizing images or comparing them unfavorably to the written
word, as images by themselves do not threaten rational thinking.
Understanding images from ancient cultures, like the ancient Orient, takes effort and
openness to their unique visual language.
B, the way humans and their bodies are perceived changes across different cultures and times.
Modern historical anthropology explores how body depictions serve as a form of communication
in ancient cultures, including the ancient Orient and the Old Testament.
These historical perceptions can be very different from today's views and deeply influence traditional
beliefs about human forms.
To understand old representations of human forms, like those in the Old Testament, we
must set aside our modern biases and learn from the historical context of those times.
Misunderstandings can arise if we don't adjust our approach to accommodate those cultural
differences.
I think most people know the famous commandment to avoid creating idols.
You shall have no other gods before me.
You shall not make any pacelle, idol, and no likeness of things in heaven above on earth
below or what is in the water under the earth.
Do not bow down to them, to worship them, and do not serve them.
For I am Yahweh, your God, a Majela's God who visits the sins of the fathers on the
children to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me, but who is faithful
to thousands who love me and keep my commandments.
The pacelle refers to an ancient sculpted figure often made with precious metals by
goldsmiths.
These small idols, from the late Bronze Age to the Iron Age in the region of Israel-Palestine,
usually stand no taller than 15 centimeters, though some larger pieces have been found.
Great care was given to carving the idols' face and hands, likely because these features
were thought to connect with the divine.
The eyes were especially realistic, and the use of gold or silver gave the figures a godly
glow.
The positions of these statues were meaningful.
A god could be shown sitting or standing, often on a base, and their stance might express
power or welcome.
Their outfits were diverse, sometimes including crowns or shoes, and occasionally jewelry
like earrings to draw attention to certain areas, adding to their grandeur.
We can find many material images of the gods in very descriptive way that match the verbal
descriptions of them in the literature, but a lurking scholarly question remains about
which idols are absolutely forbidden, idols of Yahweh or idols of foreign gods.
Two explanations have scholarly attention.
One theory suggests that originally Yahweh worship did not include images, which is why
they were forbidden.
Any animal images found, like the golden calf in Exodus, are exceptions and not well understood.
This rule also became stricter over time because of the rejection of foreign gods.
Or two, another view holds that the ban on images developed later, particularly during
and after the Babylonian exile, when the Israelites were away from their temple.
This period made them rely less on physical images for worship and think of their god
in new, non-physical ways.
The influence of foreign gods also played a role in shaping this rule.
This is the position Francesca Stavrakapulu argues, and it makes a lot of sense.
Why ban an idea if it isn't something happening already?
Whatever the case actually is, the strict thrust towards not making images in Yahweh
religion became a foundational component.
This Babylonian exilic or post-exilic text in the decalogue may have been influenced
by Persian religion, and if one dates this material into the Hellenistic period, one
can see Plato and the philosopher's condemnation of idols as a growing trend, because the true
god cannot be made into an image.
As Francesca has pointed out in her book about Xenophonies, talking about horses making
gods into their image, cattle making gods into their image, the point for these philosophers
was God had no image, God was image-less.
We even have the Greek philosopher Heraclitus, an ancient Persian-controlled Ephesus during
the 6th century BCE, seemingly echoing a condemnation of idol worship.
This philosopher is saying this around the same time that Persia controlled Judeans.
They raised their voices at stone idols, as a man might argue with his doorpost.
They have understood so little of the gods.
This really isn't an outlandish idea, especially in light of the syncretism of Zoroastrian
thought with Greek thinkers.
Some scholars have suggested Heraclitus' thought about fire may have inspiration from
Zoroastrianism.
Many of the doctrines of Zoroastrian fire do not match exactly with those of Heraclitus,
such as the relation of fire to earth, but he may have taken some inspiration from them.
This is from Martin L. West, 1971.
We find heavy discouragement of idol worship even in Zoroastrian Avesta.
You could see in verse 10, but you despise the good and poor and worthy and travelers.
You also disregarded God and you worshipped idols and practiced evil thoughts and evil
words and evil deeds.
So in reality, what caused the imageless worship of Yahweh?
Was it simply being too far away from home and not having the images with them?
Was there a shift in the religious environment of Persia and Greek thinkers to depict God
without image?
Who knows exactly what the case is, but I love exploring the various paths.
I want to highlight what Francesca says in her book.
The biblical ban on divine images is often held to signal the incorporeal nature of God,
marking him out as a deity distinct from any other in the ancient world, a deity impossible
to craft in clay or metal, wood or stone, by virtue of being bodyless.
But the Bible's promotion of imageless worship indicates no such thing.
The cults of various Egyptian, Assyrian, Babylonian and Phoenician deities all experienced periods
of an iconic worship despite the fact that these deities were understood to have bodies.
The prohibition of divine images in the Ten Commandments points instead to a growing emphasis
on the hiddenness of God's body as a closely related tradition in Deuteronomy indicates.
Depicting God and Man
Sometimes visuals help aid us in seeing what's in the biblical texts, so I've decided to
share three images from Dr. Wagner's book, God's Body, to really nail the verbal visualization
of God compared to man, organized with each body part on the far left.
The examples that could be given are massive and this literally just scratches the surface.
You can find several other examples all throughout Dr. Stavrakapulu's book, God and Anatomy.
We're looking at table 2.1, matching of exemplary biblical references for the comparison of
bodily forms of God and man respectively.
On the body part section, you're looking ahead and we're starting with bodily form external
verbal image of God, then we'll move right.
Isaiah 59-17, he, Yahweh, put on righteousness as his breastplate and set the helmet of salvation
on his head and put on the garments of revenge and attired himself with zeal as with a cloak.
For the man, number 6-5, as long as his vow lasts no razor shall be used on his head.
He is holy until the time he has vowed himself to Yahweh has passed and he must allow the
hair on his head to grow long.
They're talking about head, the person's head, you've got the man's head, nobody doubts
the man has a head, you get to God, it's someone God's head, well the authors thought God had
an actual head, a bodily head.
These aren't metaphors, if they're metaphor for God, they're metaphor for man, apply that
logic to every body part described throughout this video and anytime you open up your Bible.
Psalm 60 verse 9, God has spoken in his sanctuary, Gilead is mine, Manasseh is mine, Ephraim
is the safeguard on my head, Judah is my scepter, Zechariah 6-11, take silver and gold
from them and make crowns and crown the head of Joshua, the high priest, the son of Jehoshedek.
You will notice as the documentary continues, sometimes the language is used in a metaphorical
way but even in the metaphor it is implied there is a real physical, actual, attributable
body behind the usage of this language that needs to be real or else the metaphor falls
apart.
Face or countenance, Genesis 33-10, Jacob answered, No please, if I have found favor
in your eyes, accept the gift from my hands, for I saw your face as if I saw God's countenance
and you were gracious to me, of course there's Job as well, Amos, Genesis 6-8, Noah found
favor in the eyes of Yahweh.
Then you go to the right with man, Genesis 43-31 and after he Joseph had cried, had washed
his face, he went out and controlled himself and said, Serve the food, 2 Samuel 19-5, but
the king covered his face and cried aloud, Oh my son, Absalom, my son, my son, goes
on talking about eyes and sight in their face.
Continuing into the next page of table 2.1, Ear, 2 Kings 19-16, Hezekiah says, Yahweh,
live ear and hear, open your eyes and see and hear the words Senecharib has sent to
insult the living God.
Let's look at the man side, Exodus 32-2, Aaron spoke to them, take off the golden earrings
on the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters and bring them to me.
Just want to make a note how many times believers say God hears their prayers and do they think
God actually hears their prayers or is this spirit not actually listening because it doesn't
have ears?
Oh no, it's way beyond our comprehension and this is just little anthropomorphized language
for us to understand.
Nose, 2 Samuel 22-9, Smoke rose from his nostrils, nose and consuming fire from his mouth, flames
came from him, Genesis 2-7 with man, And Yahweh God formed man out of the earth from
the field and blew the breath of life into his nostrils, nose and man became a living
soul.
Let's go down to mouth, Leviticus 24-12, and took him a blaspheming Israelite prisoner
until they received a clear answer from the mouth of Yahweh, Judges 7-6.
The number of men who lapped was 300.
All the rest of the people drank kneeling from the hand to the mouth.
Go to throat neck, Jeremiah 6-8, Men your ways Jerusalem before I turn my neck from
you and make you a desolate country in which no one lives.
Psalm 69-2, God help me for the water has come up to my neck.
Third page, Table 2.1, Arm, Exodus 15-16, Terror and dread fell upon them, they froze
like stones in the face of your powerful arm until the people passed by who you purchased.
On the man side, Psalm 18-35, He teaches my hands to fight and my arm to bend the bronze
bow.
Right hand, Isaiah 2-62-8, Yahweh has sworn by his right hand and by his mighty arm.
Genesis 48-13, Then Joseph took them both, Ephraim on his right hand toward Israel's
left hand, and Manasseh by his left hand toward Israel's right hand and brought them to him.
Sounds pretty actual as a body.
And Jeremiah 18-6, Can I not treat you, you, from the house of Israel?
As this potter does, Yahweh declares, Look like clay in the hand of the potter, so are
you in my hand, O house of Israel.
Proverbs 26-15, With the man side, the slugger buries his hand in the dish, and he is too
lazy to bring it to his mouth.
And then foot, 2 Samuel 22-10, He, Yahweh, bowed the heavens, and came down in darkness
was under his feet.
Genesis 18-4, Let a little water be brought to wash your feet, and take a seat under this
tree.
It's odd that we look at one side and say metaphor and play off the language as if it's
not actually talking about those objects, and then we get to the man side and it's the
same kind of language, and then we take that not as metaphor, well we should start being
more consistent.
And it's not hard to piece together an idea of what God or humans looked like based on
descriptions found in ancient texts.
These descriptions show clear similarities.
In simple terms, the same language describing actual bodies of the humans in these texts
also applies to God.
This is true for the literature as well as carved images we will see in a bit, but I
want to make one note, there are euphemisms sometimes in these bodily objects that can
mean other things.
Francesca Stavrakapulu covers that in her book, God and Anatomy.
We don't dwell on that much in this version of the documentary, the other documentary
we do.
Wrestling with God's Body
Let's take a fascinating journey through how the Bible talks about God looking and
acting like a human, and how these ideas have evolved over time by various theologians.
In the Old Testament, the big no-no was creating physical images of God or other deities like
statues.
The problem wasn't with the idea that God could look like a human, the issue was when
people turned these images into idols, objects of worship.
This distinction is crucial because the Bible itself often describes God in human terms,
showing emotions, making decisions, even taking physical form.
This human-like description of God isn't just an old biblical style, something theologians
have grappled with for centuries.
For instance, philosophers like Martin Heidegger have explored how our language shapes our
understanding of God as having human traits.
When Christianity came along, the plot thickened with Jesus Christ, who Christians believe
is God in human form.
Suddenly, the depiction of God wasn't just permissible, it became essential to understanding
the Christian faith.
This was a significant shift from earlier times when any physical depiction of God could
be controversial.
As forward to the theologians like Philo of Alexandria, we see a shift again.
They started to describe God in more abstract terms, beyond physical and emotional human
traits.
They argued that God is beyond our full understanding.
We should be happy just knowing God exists, without trying to pin down an exact image
or likeness.
But despite this abstract term, the idea that we're made in God's image remained powerful.
It suggests that even if we can't fully grasp what God is like, we can still see reflections
of God's nature through the good things in life, kind of like how gifts remind us of
the giver.
Rather than the literal description of things being what they are in these ancient texts,
the interpreter, being many church fathers, started to suggest the true meaning was the
revelation of the concept or idea.
So while the Old Testament cautioned against making God into an idol, over time the focus
shifted from what God isn't to be celebrating how God interacts with the world and us.
It's a story of how our view of the divine has evolved from statues to sublities, from
concrete images to complex ideas.
Under the sway of Logo-Stheology, which emphasizes a more abstract understanding of God, the
Christian tradition initially continued to steer clear of portraying God with human traits.
This approach got a significant boost from Augustine in the 4th century.
He coined the term anthropomorphites to describe a group called the audience.
That term is related to the word audio, criticizing them for picturing God as just another human
being, subject to human weaknesses and limitations.
Augustine's critique hinged on a deeper thread in Christian thought, one that could
always pull from Greek philosophy to argue against imagining the divine in human form.
A striking illustration from this Greek vein is offered by Xenophanes, a philosopher from
ancient Asia Minor.
With a touch of wit, he imagined that if animals could create art, they would depict gods that
looked like themselves, horses as horse-like gods, oxen as ox-like gods.
This idea cleverly highlights the absurdity of crafting deities in our image.
The early church debates didn't solve these issues, but laid the groundwork for ongoing
tension between biblical descriptions of God and the philosophical urge to transcend these
anthropomorphic instincts.
This tension is vivid in the discussions of theologians, who later argued that biblical
language humanizing God-like attributing emotions and physical parts to the divine was not literally
true, but metaphorical, meant to make the divine comprehensible to human minds.
In modern times, thinkers like Rudolf Bultmann have argued that these human-like descriptions
of God belong to mythic language of the past, and should be reinterpreted in light of contemporary
knowledge and philosophical sophistication.
This ongoing dialogue shows that biblical language interacts and often clashes with evolving theological
ideas, creating a dynamic and ever-changing landscape of belief.
The debate over anthropomorphism, the depiction of God with human traits, isn't just a theoretical
issue, it has serious implications for how we perceive the divine.
One of the main concerns is that by imagining God in human terms, we risk diminishing the
true nature of God's divinity and self-existence, a seity.
The argument goes like this, if humans are created in God's image and we then depict
God as having human qualities, such as walking through Eden in the evening, speaking, displaying
emotions like anger or jealousy or even changing his mind, then we must ask, does this make
God too human?
Does it reduce the divine to the mundane?
Critics worry that this is not just a simple portrayal, but a profound misunderstanding,
a kind of projection where humans reshape God into a familiar, more comprehensible form,
effectively creating God in our own image rather than recognizing our creation in his.
These concerns are echoed not just in specialized theological debates, but also in broader interpretations
of the Old Testament.
There, scholars strive not just to recognize instances of anthropomorphism, but to understand
them in a way that preserves the majesty and mystery of the divine.
This endeavor involves balancing the accessible, relatable descriptions of God with the profound
otherness and transcendence that theology asserts God embodies.
The Babel Bible dispute sparked by Frederick Dalitsch, provocative lecture Babel and Bible
in 1902 stirred significant debate regarding the authority and interpretation of the Bible.
Dalitsch used newly discovered pre-biblical Akkadian text from Babylon to challenge the
uniqueness and authority of the Old Testament.
He argued that many aspects of the Old Testament, including its anthropomorphic descriptions
of God, were remnants of a less sophisticated stage of human development, similar to early
human beliefs and practices found in other ancient cultures.
Dalitsch's view reflect a common 19th century belief in cultural evolution, where societies
and their religious beliefs were thought to progress from primitive to advanced stages.
He considered anthropomorphism, depicting God with human traits and emotions, as a naive
early stage that should be transcended by a more enlightened understanding of the divine.
This perspective aligns with the thoughts of Ludwig Feuerbach, who in his 1841 work,
The Essence of Christianity, argued more radically that God is essentially a projection of human
qualities, purified and idealized.
According to Feuerbach, religious beliefs reflect human attributes and ideals rather
than any external divine reality.
E. Selen later tackled the anthropomorphism issue by suggesting that such depictions of
God were merely an early form of divine revelation, suitable for the spiritual and intellectual
maturity of the times, but later surpassed within the Old Testament narrative itself.
He posited that as the Israelites understanding evolved, so did their concept of God, moving
from a tangible human-like form to a more abstract and transcendent entity.
This notion of accommodation implies that God revealed himself in ways that were comprehensible
at different stages of human development.
However, this interpretation is not without its problems.
It risks diminishing the relevance and spiritual insights of earlier biblical texts by labeling
them as primitive or outdated.
Moreover, it raises questions about the validity of viewing spiritual evolution as a linear
progression where later stages are necessarily superior to earlier ones.
Such a view might overlook the possibility that each era with its unique perspectives
and insights has an immediate and profound experience of the divine valuable on its own terms.
One could continue this argument by suggesting that the later scripture, which is now considered
old and dated, like the New Testament, well, that needs an updating and in fact is also
now primitive because of where we sit today.
Where is the updated revelation in which we should receive that accurately reflects the
divine?
This problem will continue until we either are extinct or something else gives.
W. Eichroth, like E. Selen, grapples with the challenges of anthropomorphism and biblical
text but acknowledges the necessity and potency of such descriptions.
Eichroth emphasizes that the vivid human-like depictions of God found in the Old Testament
serve a crucial role.
They capture the immediacy and tangible presence of the divine, attributes that might be lost
under more abstract, spiritualized concepts.
This immediacy, Eichroth argues, compels the biblical authors to portray God in human forms,
a necessity to express the profound sense of God's presence in interaction with humanity.
Eichroth also acknowledges the parallel tradition within the Old Testament that recognizes the
limitations of such anthropomorphic descriptions.
From early on, there is an awareness that seeing God as He truly is remains beyond human capability.
Eichroth identifies several layers of spiritualization in the depiction of God that move beyond direct
anthropomorphism.
These include the use of intermediaries like Yahweh's messenger, symbolic elements such
as Yahweh's kabod, or splendor, and God's countenance, and abstract concepts like the
name of Yahweh.
Further, he discusses the representation of God's influence through dynamic elements
such as His word, spirit, and wisdom, which are accessible and recognizable even in contemporary
religious thought.
Eichroth's perspective links back to early Christian theological efforts to articulate
a conception of God that was both accessible and suitably transcendent, steering clear
of simplistic human likenesses while maintaining a connection to human understanding.
However, there is a risk in this process, as pointed out by critiques of Selen and Eichroth.
Both scholars in their attempt to refine the understanding of God might lean heavily on
post-biblical, logos-oriented, rational concepts of God that have dominated much of the theological
history.
This orientation risks imposing a later, possibly more philosophically developed perspective
onto the ancient text, potentially obscuring or altering their original meaning and the
way God was understood and experienced in the biblical era.
First Dietrich Proust, 1991, Otto Kaiser in 1998, and Rolf Rindorf, 2001 all take a
stab at dealing with the anthropomorphisms.
We aren't going to get into their arguments here.
Various other theologians tackled a problem of anthropomorphic depictions of God in other
ways, and the list goes on and on for other theologians.
However, it seems all these men have something in common.
They all place the biblical text into a sacred arena away from comparing it to the other
divinities of all the surrounding cultures which show obvious fingerprints on influencing
the biblical authors during the creation of these materials.
This special pleading really hinders them and those persuaded by their works from getting
back to the ancient understanding of God as another ancient Near Eastern God.
Image of Images and Real Images
Dr. Wagner in God's Body uses examples of language which create visual representations
to real world examples for the listener or reader.
The example in the book given was a tree.
By say, tree, you can see a tree in your mind's eye, but if we give more description like,
a tree with a trunk which an adult can just encompass with both arms, beaten by a continual
west wind to one side so that it grows at a 45 degree eternal tilt, highly branched,
the annual budding shooting straight upwards.
A picture of this specific tree develops in our mind's eye when we read this text.
Each statement substantiates it and adds more detail.
This only occurs if I can understand the language spoken.
Further, the more knowledge I have of the subject in question, the easier it is.
If I have never seen a tree so beaten by the wind before, then it would be harder to imagine
such a tree than if I were familiar with the phenomenon.
Therefore, I need linguistic and factual knowledge of the issue if I hope to understand
a verbal image.
Verbal images and non-verbal images are subject to the same laws and conditions, and to see
how these correspond, it's important that we use the ancient Near East which has several
visuals to help us generate images for better understanding of the Hebrew Bible.
Determining if texts are part of the ancient Israelite Hebrew tradition is usually straightforward
if they are written in Hebrew language and script.
They likely come from an ancient Israelite community.
However, classifying images as Israelite is much more complex.
We don't yet have a comprehensive understanding of the art styles, techniques, and themes
used during that period, so we lack a clear pictorial history of Israel.
For images to be identified as Israelite, they must be found in places historically
linked to ancient Israelite communities.
Even then, it's challenging to confirm if an image is genuinely Israelite because it
could have been imported or made by non-Israelites in the region.
Next we will focus on images accompanied by Hebrew text, targeting an Israelite audience,
which helps clarify their cultural context.
By examining these images, we can learn about the broader visual culture of ancient Israel
and extend these findings to other images from the period.
We will highlight the images from Dr. Wagner's book.
This first figure highlights an 8th century BCE depiction from Katilit Adroud, where Hebrew
text and imagery appear together on a pithos, indicating it was meant for an Israelite audience.
I'll focus on a specific figure from this artifact to discuss the portrayal of human
forms.
These images, though spontaneous and not polished, like those from Egypt or Mesopotamia, share
certain universal features with more refined art from those cultures, though they lack
specific cultural or stylistic elements.
Typically seen in Egyptian or Assyrian works, instead of focusing on the artistic style
or material used, this study emphasizes how human bodies and forms are depicted, regardless
of whether the scene represents a procession or a group of worshippers.
The depiction is straightforward, emphasizing essential elements like hair, there's a face,
a nose, a mouth, and eyes, but it omits detailed features such as individual physiognomy,
age markers, or textural details of skin and muscle.
Notably, the figures combine different viewpoints within the same composition.
Heads are in profile, while eyes are frontal, and torsos are shown from the front, a method
not unique to this site, but prevalent in works intended for a Hebrew audience.
This approach is mirrored in other artifacts from the period, such as a Phoenician-Israelite
seal showing two humans, or human figures, likely worshippers with similar stylistic
features.
The seal possibly belonging to someone named Menechem suggests an Israelite origin due
to the names and iconography involved.
The figures display a consistent artistic style, profiles with detailed hair and beards,
torsos in front view, and limbs in profile.
This consistent portrayal across different artifacts suggests a standardized way of depicting
the human form in the cultural context.
A Bola from the Burnt Archive offers a similar depiction, possibly representing a Judahite
king, and a city commandment where the latter is shown in a gesture of loyalty to the king,
who holds symbols of royal authority like a sword, arrow, and bow.
The depiction emphasizes the king's legitimate power and the commandment's subordinate role.
Using a familiar artistic technique where the physical details are minimal, but the symbolic
content is rich.
Another example from the Persian period features a seal depicting an inspector of Judah Yehud
as a moon god devotee, showing the same artistic conventions of profiled heads with frontal
eyes, again, and stylized postures, including a noticeable thumb detail.
This persistence of style across centuries underscores the continuity and significance
of these iconographic methods in ancient Near Eastern art, focusing more on symbolic representation
than realistic portrayal.
In the Israelite pictures we've discussed, a consistent method of depicting the human
form is evident, focusing on combining various body parts in particular ways.
Typically, the head in profile with the eye viewed from the front, this style diverges
from more traditional artistic approaches that aim for a uniform perspective in two-dimensional
art.
The depictions limit themselves to essential body parts like the head, face, eye, nose,
mouth, neck, torso, arms, hands, legs, and feet.
Notably absent are individual details and features, such as distinct facial characteristics
or the intricacies of anatomy.
This lack of detail could be attributed to the spontaneous nature of the artwork, such
as that found at Katilat Adrud, or the limitations imposed by the small scale of Sils and Bullah.
Comparing these depictions to more expansive and detailed works, such as the bas-reliefs
found in Egypt or Assyria, might offer further insights.
These larger and more detailed artworks provide a contrast that highlights the distinct artistic
choices and constraints in the smaller Israelite representations.
This comparison could help elucidate why the Israelite artist might have opted for such
a stylized and simplified approach to depicting the human form.
Take for example this artistic rendition of what appears to possibly be Yahweh of Samaria
and Asherah.
The artist depicts even the penis of the God, with the horned crown as well.
These signs of individual details of each distinct body part is heightened in the language,
as Francesca has pointed out in her book.
Pictures from Syria, Palestine
In the exploration of corporeal depictions across various periods and regions, particularly
Syria-Palestine, the fundamental principles of human representation remain largely consistent
with those identified in Israelite art.
These principles typically involve a profile view of the head, combined with a frontal
view of the eye and torso, creating a multi-perspective portrayal that contrasts with more uniform
artistic traditions.
Despite the core similarities, there are notable differences in iconographic programs, styles
and symbolism, influenced by diverse cultural interactions across Syria-Palestine.
We will look at two images from this region.
For instance, Egyptian elements are easily recognized in artifacts from regions under
Egyptian influence, such as the scarab from Bet-Shean, dating to the time of Ramesses II,
which depicts the pharaoh in a traditional Egyptian posture, head and legs in profile,
but torso frontal, emphasizing his dominance as he holds a sword.
Further examples include a scarab from Megiddo, illustrating the triumph pharaoh in a similar
stance.
And another from Hazor, showcasing worshippers beside a crescent moon standard, indicating
northern Syrian influences and symbolizing the moon god Aran.
These depictions adhere to the discussed principles of caporial representation, despite their
distinct cultural settings.
Moreover, a scarab from Samaria features two worshippers in a unique arrangement, possibly
intended to complement each other, one focusing visually and the other acoustically, although
it's unclear if this was the artist's intention or a result of poor execution.
The continuity of these artistic conventions extends into the Persian era, maintaining
the established pattern of head in profile, eye in front, and absence of detailed features.
This consistency suggests a pervasive and enduring approach to depicting the human form
in the broader Syria-Palestine region, spanning from the Late Bronze Age through the Iron
Ages.
However, a distinct shift occurs with the introduction of Greek influence in the Phoenician area.
Here, the portrayal of Hercules featured more dynamically contoured muscles, indicating
a departure from the traditional profile and frontal views to a more modeled, realistic
depiction of the body, aligning with Greek artistic norms.
This change marks a significant divergence from the earlier more schematic styles of
the region, reflecting the profound impact of Hellenistic cultural and artistic influx.
Pictures from Egypt, pictures of the Assyrians, Babylonians, and Persians.
A consistent depiction of humans across Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the broader Syria-Palestine
region is apparent.
This persisted until the Greek Hellenistic influence brought a different artistic style.
In the depicted Egyptian artworks, such as the colourful scenes of the Pharaoh hunting,
a scribe at work, and a household scene featuring the head of a family with his wife and son,
we observe a consistent application of multi-perspectivity.
Pay close attention to how Pharaoh is much larger than everyone else, because he is far
more important than anyone depicted.
This is also evident in the other Egyptian works of art.
This artistic approach combines different views of the body parts.
The torso is typically shown in frontal view, while the head is in profile, and the eyes
are often depicted from the front.
This method is characteristic, not just of the works from Egypt, but also appears in
the artistic traditions of other ancient Near Eastern cultures.
Assyria
In the Assyrian depictions, particularly those of King Aserharan, with his sons Aserbanipole
and Aser Shumulkin, we observe a continuation of certain artistic conventions similar to
those in Egypt and Syria-Palestine, yet, with some notable differences that enhance the
detail and naturalism of the figures, the size differentiation among the figures serves
a hierarchical purpose, clearly identifying the king's superior status, relative to his
sons, and the even smaller figures of conquered rulers, emphasizing the king's dominance
and authority.
This method of using scale to signify importance is a common element across various ancient
cultures.
The figures in Assyrian art maintain the multi-perspective approach with legs depicted in profile and
in motion, heads in profile, and eyes typically shown from the front.
These characteristics align with the rest of what we've seen.
However, Assyrian art also displays a greater interest in anatomical details.
Unlike Egyptian figures, which often appear more stylized and less detailed, Assyrian
depictions frequently include more defined muscles, knees, and ankles, giving the figure
a more dynamic and naturalistic appearance.
Additionally, Assyrian depictions occasionally diverge from the Egyptian preference for front
view torsos, instead presenting torsos in profile.
This shift not only contributes to a sense of depth and realism, but also complements
the overall dynamic poses of the figures, which are often depicted in scenes of action
or conquest.
Despite these details, Assyrian art, like its regional counterparts, avoids portraying
individual features or expressions of sight that would suggest personal identity or emotional
depth.
The focus remains on idealized, typical gestures and body forms that convey power and divinity
rather than personal characteristics.
This treatment is evident even in scenes requiring a high level of detail, such as the depiction
of a river crossing, where the backs of naked soldiers are visible.
The portrayal still adheres to conventional stylizations avoiding individuality in favor
of a collective and idealized representation.
Thus, while Assyrian art shares foundational principles with other ancient Near Eastern
art forms, it introduces its own nuances that reflect its cultural and aesthetic priorities,
emphasizing a blend of symbolic representation with a hint of naturalism that differentiates
it from its Egyptian and Syrian Palestinian counterparts.
You can also see these very things with the Persian procession and some of the Persian
art as well.
Again, very detailed in some ways, but stylistic and it wants to give you kind of a generic
feel for what the overall image is, the general depiction is similar.
Babylon and Persia.
In Babylonian and Persian art, the principles of caporial representation, again, continue
to align with those observed in other ancient Oriental and Israelite depictions.
Despite cultural and temporal differences, the portrayal of the human form in these regions
maintains a consistent approach that is conceptually oriented rather than strictly observational.
Key features across cultures.
The representation of the human body in these cultures does not seek to capture an optical,
realistic view, but instead focuses on conveying essential and typical elements.
This method known as multi-perspectivity involves displaying various parts of the body
in their most recognizable forms, legs and stride and profile,
heads and profile, with eyes often depicted frontally.
This approach transcends specific cultural or chronological contexts and serves as unifying
artistic convention across the ancient Oriental world, examples and principles,
donkey with backpacks or pack bags.
This example illustrates how artists prioritized conveying information over optical accuracy.
The depiction of pack bags, one hanging correctly and the other seemingly upright,
is not a mistake, but a deliberate choice to show both bags, ensuring viewers understand
their presence and function.
Two, bedside scene.
In another instance, the scene simplifies to the essential components of a bed to focus
on its significance, especially in a symbolic or ritual context like the birth of a king.
Here the bed frame is shown from above and the sideboards in profile,
emphasizing the essential elements while maintaining a straightforward perspective,
artistic conventions and perspectives.
The art from these regions is characterized by its frontal views, avoiding oblique angles.
This style named by H. Schaefer emphasizes the conceptual over the perceptual,
where objects and figures are represented as they are thought to exist in a more symbolic or ideal form.
Such depictions are not concerned with how things appear in reality,
but rather how they are understood and recognized within cultural and religious contexts.
Further extending this principle, objects like stools and pools are depicted in a way that combines
various perspectives to best convey their function and essence.
For example, a stool is shown with its legs in profile, or stability, and its seat from above
to emphasize its use.
While pools are depicted as geometric shapes surrounded by nature, focusing on their placement
rather than their depth or the play of light and shadows.
This conceptual approach to depiction differs remarkably from European traditions,
especially modern ones, where the emphasis often lies on optical realism and perspective accuracy.
Ancient Oriental art, including that from Babylon and Persia,
uses a fundamentally different visual language.
This language prioritizes symbolic meaning and functional representation
over lifelike or trail, thus offering a distinct way to understand and appreciate
the artistic legacy of these ancient cultures.
In the next few images, you can capture the point of how each part of the body is emphasized.
The profile is not universal, rather, eye and shoulder are depicted frontally,
because this is how these parts of the body can best be seen.
The Egyptian artist plays several aspects next to each other,
in one picture to emphasize each of them.
Each is captured singly and all parts assembled to a whole.
The single parts relate to their neighbors, but not necessarily to the whole.
Therefore, eye and shoulder are unhesitatingly placed in full front view
within a picture of a man otherwise in profile.
The same holds true for human representation in pre-Greek ancient Oriental art.
Dr. Wagner does a deep dive investigating human depictions and statues as well,
then moves into verbal images, comparisons, and metaphors in the language.
These verbal images are an everyday speech and poetry.
They bring up an image to the reader or listener that usually hits home for them to understand.
If someone is using agricultural imagery, then it supposes the audience knows that world.
Understanding comparisons and their cultural context is crucial for interpreting ancient texts
accurately. For instance, in the Song of Songs, a biblical poem, different body parts like the
neck, nose, and breast are compared to towers. However, these comparisons aren't about the
physical appearance as we might think today. Ancient towers were sturdy and served as fortifications,
not slim and tall like modern perceptions might suggest.
For example, a woman's neck is described as like the Tower of David, which at first might
make us think it suggests the neck is long and slim. But in the context of the time,
towers were broad and strong, indicating the metaphor likely symbolizes strength or dignity
rather than shape. In no way does the woman not exist or not have a body though,
even when we use metaphorical language. Similarly, the comparison of a nose to the Tower of Lebanon
doesn't imply a literal resemblance. Instead, it could suggest prominence or a distinct feature
devoid of any implication about the nose's shape. The metaphor extends even to the woman's breast,
described as towers, not to suggest their shape, but their impregnability and strength,
reflecting perhaps a protective or reserved nature. This approach shifts away from physical
appearance to the functionality and symbolic meaning of these body parts, emphasizing traits like strength,
defense, and pride rather than physical form. The poem uses these metaphors to convey deeper
meanings about the subjects, using the cultural context of the time, which valued functionality
and symbolic representation over mere physical description. This approach is radically different
than playing theology. We are trying to understand the language and the pictures they form in our
heads by seeing things through their ancient context instead of being trapped by our modern
ideas. In the Old Testament, the descriptions of body parts often carry meanings that go beyond
their literal physical attributes, reflecting the cultural and linguistic context of the time.
This concept is known as the functional meaning of body parts, where each part is associated with
specific actions, qualities, or symbolic values rather than just its physical form.
For example, when Isaiah describes the feet of a messenger who brings good news across mountains,
he's not praising the physical beauty of the feet, but celebrating their role in swiftly
delivering important messages. Similarly, when judges mention, my own hand has helped me,
it refers to the personal effort and strength of Israel, not just a physical hand.
This functional interpretation is essential for understanding the rich, layered meanings
in biblical language. The Hebrew vocabulary is relatively compact, yet it conveys a broad
spectrum of nuances by focusing on the function or symbolic significance of body parts within
specific contexts. This way of thinking connects the physical part of the body to a broader,
more dynamic representation of human actions and attributes. Understanding this language of body
parts is crucial for interpreting biblical texts accurately. It requires a deep dive into both the
linguistic patterns and the cultural codes of the time. This approach is particularly important
when dealing with anthropomorphic descriptions where arts of the body play a role. It should be
obvious that this will aid us in linguistic depiction of the body of God. In cultural
representations, both verbal and material depictions of humans often follow similar principles,
highlighting how people use consistent imagery across different mediums to convey meanings
and values. This concept is well illustrated in the Song of Songs where the descriptive hymns
vividly portray human figures using a selective approach to body parts, mirroring the method used
in visual art we discussed earlier. In these hymns, only specific body parts are chosen to
represent the whole person, emphasizing traits that are culturally significant or symbolically
powerful. For example, descriptions like your feet in sandals and the curves of your thighs are like
jewels or and his eyes are like doves by the water streams. Focus on parts that convey beauty,
strength or other desirable qualities. These parts are not randomly chosen. They're typical of the
cultural and poetic ideals of the time, crafted to evoke specific emotions or thoughts in the
audience. This selective representation in verbal form is akin to how sculptures or painters might
emphasize certain features over others to capture the essence of their subject. Just as a sculpture
might detail the hands of a figure to show their skill or the strength of a character, the poet
uses metaphorical language to highlight qualities like grace, power or allure through the description
of body parts. Thus, the Song of Songs provides a rich example of how the ancients integrated
poetic language and artistic principles to create a vivid holistic image of a person
using only parts. Illustrating a broader cultural understanding of human beauty and virtue,
this integration shows a deep connection between language and material arts where both are used
to construct and convey similar concepts of the human form and its idealized traits.
Parts of the body have functional meaning.
The functional interpretation of body parts in both verbal and material depictions within the
ancient Oriental and Old Testament context emphasizes that these interpretations serve
specific purposes beyond mere visual or aesthetic appeal. This approach to understanding body parts
is illustrated in various cultural artifacts where certain parts, such as hands, are depicted
not for their physical likeness but for their symbolic or functional significance. For instance,
the depiction of a hand from Corbett-El-Colm is not just an artistic rendering, it serves a specific
purpose, symbolizing protection. Scholars like Shrower and Mittman agree on its apotropaic function,
which means it's aversion to evil, indicating that the hand symbolizes God's protective presence.
This interpretation aligns with how verbal depictions in text, like the Old Testament,
also emphasize the functional aspect of body parts, such as hands conveying action
or divine intervention rather than focusing solely on the physical form of a hand.
This symbolic use of body parts in art resembles the use of language in speech acts,
where the intent and effect of spoken words are central. Similarly, in what can be termed
pictorial acts, the imagery intentionally invokes a function or response, performing much like verbal
declarations or commands. These representations are not merely descriptive but are performative,
crafted to evoke or command presence, protection, or other concepts tied to cultural beliefs
practices. Thus, understanding these depictions requires a focus on the contextual and functional
significance of the body parts, recognizing them as a form of communication that conveys
deeper meanings within the cultural and historical settings of the Ancient Near East.
You can see why some try to use these symbolic functions as theological ways to hide God's body,
because without that first-hand original context, culturally, visually, symbolically, you won't be
able to really understand this in depth. This is why we took the trail we did, explaining linguistic,
pictorial linguistic connections and material connections, trying to get a better grasp of
how the Ancients used the functionality of body parts, the visuals of body parts, and how they
served more than just the literal function of their appearance, but the symbolic would not work
without the actual underlying body being a present, existent thing.
Kerbed El-Kom is an archaeological site west of Hebron in the Judean Hills. The two tombs
that were found there were researched by archaeologist William G. Dever in 1967.
This inscription is dated to the mid-eighth century BCE. Scholars have been able to decipher
most of the inscription on the tomb. The translation is on the screen, Ur-Yahu,
the chief ruler writing, bless Ur-Yahu by Yahweh, and from his enemies' rivals by Asherah,
deliverance by Ur-Yahu, Asherah, and Ash-Ashherah. But while most stress the blessing and deliverance
by Yahweh, negating the application of Ashherah in the process, you will see that the hand
is representative of the blessing of Ashherah. The anthropomorphized understanding remains the same,
but let's take a quick joy ride into this evolution. First, let's look at the association
of Tannit with Ashherah, and it was the Phoenician Carthaginian from 814 BCE to 146 BCE, name of
this goddess. She is a later version of the mother goddess Atirath, Ash-Ratu, Ash-Rah,
with ties to Athena, that makes me wonder as a non-expert Athena, could there be connections
to the Greek here, and Anath, she was the consort to Baal-Hamon, having the epithet Pne Baal, face
of Baal. Her symbol is a circle inside a crescent, supported by a triangle. The images in question
bear a resemblance to depictions of Ash-Rah, characterized by symbols of fertility, such as
flora and fauna. These were found among amulets in Ash-Kalon, historically a Philistine city.
An article by Steger discusses an ivory plaque from the Phoenician city of Sarepta,
dating to the 7th century BCE, featuring the name Tannit Ash-Tart. This small relic,
discovered by Professor James Pritchard, measures merely 2 inches by 1.3 inches,
and bears an inscription possibly linking it to a statue. This text memorializes the dedication
of the statue to Tannit Ash-Tart by SLM, son of MPL, son of ZY. William Dever, in his book
Did God Have a Wife, notes that doves, which often symbolize Ash-Rah, are similarly associated with
Tannit, indicating a cultural and religious connection between these figures in the histories
of Israel and Judah. Mark Smith's Early History of God further explores this linkage, citing
several ancient texts from Lebanon that refer to Tannit as the face of Baal, reflecting her
significant role in regional religious contexts. These sources collectively highlight the intertwined
nature of mythological figures across different cultures and epochs in the ancient Mediterranean.
Here are a few more images of Tannit, worthy of recognition, since we are recognizing overlap
between Ash-Rah and Tannit here. There is a Stila with the engraved symbol of the Goddess Tannit.
Many of the funeral Stila discovered at Carthage portray Tannit with this type of symbolism.
Above is Tannit, and the crescent moon symbol, representative of her consort Baal Hamon. We
know in the Bible what's really interesting is the competition between Yahweh and Baal.
And if we look at the earlier Ugaritic 13th century information we've discovered through
tablets, this is something that was emphasized by Francesca Stavragapoulou. El is the supreme
god ruling on a throne, kind of in retirement. Baal, the storm warrior deity, he ran things for
his father El. Well, here you have Yahweh competing in Elijah mythology over against
Yahweh and Baal with these worshippers almost competing for who's gonna run things.
And of course Yahweh wins out with this particular Yahwist propaganda in the Bible. But the fact
that these characters that are outside of the Bible all throughout the region show up within the
Bible not only is it fascinating historically to evaluate these observations, but anyone who
wants to isolate drawing the conclusion that is just told from the Bible without opening their
brains to see and understand the conflict and the battle going on between various cults are missing
what I would say are the best fun moments in these discoveries and how these gods are competing
for who is going to win out. The fact that the inscription with the hand at the beginning even
has Yahweh and Asherah's name together tells you there were cultists that were actually worshiping
both and hope for the protection of both in the same context. So we will be doing a follow-up
on the wife of God, Asherah, and doing a historical deep dive because this is too fascinating.
A further evolution in the symbolism associated with Tanim is seen in the open hand of blessing
which also serves a protective function. This development is supported by various
stela discovered in Carthage. Over time this symbol of the open hand became increasingly
significant particularly within the religious traditions of Judaism and Islam where it evolved
to hold a prominent place as a symbol of both blessing and protection. We could see some of
the art here really really amazing pieces that we found and then another image with the fragment
of a stela with the symbol of the goddess Tana and other emblems from Carthage in its limestone.
Really really cool the hand on the left you've got the crescent moon symbol above her head kind of
makes me wonder this crescent moon thing how common and prevalent it is that among different
cults different religions and we find that as a very important symbol in Islam also another one
here with two doves and then the hand symbol at the top you could see the goddess at the bottom here
so in Jewish tradition the symbol of the protective blessing hand is known as the Hamesh.
In Islamic culture it is referred to as the hand of Fatima or Hamza which means five in Arabic
symbolizing the five fingers and thumb these amulets which feature hand symbols are prevalent in
both Judaism and Islam often used to ward off the evil eye today people wear crosses and other
types of symbols on their bodies hoping that it would give them luck you might see someone with
a rabbit foot thinking that this is magic or some type of luck will come in the ancient world they
were huge on magic magical principles magical ways in which they can ward off evil from entering
their life ward off diseases help them with crops whatever their options were we've heard the phrase
blood magic the idea of sacrifices is to magically in some ways enrich your own life to help you in
some way that was beneficial and this is ubiquitous in the entire world you could see it in South
American Mayan sacrifices of humans even in the Middle East with sacrifices of animals and earlier
humans which we could go to Carthage or Phoenicia and see that they were doing this we have ancient
sources magic was important and the evil eye was also a very powerful thing discussed by
Francesca Stavrakapulu in her book God an Anatomy the encyclopedia Judaica notes that hand symbols
on amulets particularly those made of silver and originating from north africa are common these
symbols are believed to provide protection against the evil eye while some attribute the hand of
Fatima to the daughter of Muhammad the use of hand symbols in north african amulets predates
Islam by over a thousand years tracing back to carthaginian times today the tradition remains
strong in regions like Morocco Tunisia and Algeria as well as across the muslim world the Talmud
describes a specific gesture to avert the evil eye placing the right thumb in the left hand and the
left thumb in the right hand while declaring one's lineage from joseph this practice underscores the
enduring belief in the evil eye among eastern european jews and many oriental jewish communities
in contemporary times the use of blue paint and metal amulets shaped like an open palm continues
to be a widespread thing among these communities as the symbolism of the hand evolved in both
jewish and islamic cultures an additional feature often incorporated was an eye placed in the center
of the hand this modification enhances the amulets protective qualities specifically targeting the
evil eye a malevolent gaze believed to bring bad luck or harm to the person that it's directed at
considering that tannin has a connection with ashara a hand of blessing or protection deliverance
occurs at the same time to the elcom inscription some say the hand should be connected to the
ashara in that inscription originally shown which had yahweh and ashara's name we will be jumping
back on track to god's body but before we do we just want to point out the striking correlation
between the human body and the god's body in the language this is important as we turn to god's body
god's hands
doctor wagner says it really well just as the human hand can take formative action
so can god's hands god's formative action can however reach as far as forming the whole of
creation the creation is the work of his hands psalm 19 to isaia 45 12 i made the earth and created
mankind upon it i both my hands spread out the heavens the earth remains in the hands power of god
exodus 15 12 as you stretched out your right hand it swallowed the earth god's hand is found as is
god's arms in phrases about leading israel out of egypt the phrase with a mighty hand
an outstretched arm is found in deuteronomy all over the place and in texts based on deuteronomy
germaia psalms they all refer to the exodus germaia 32 21 and you yahweh brought your people israel
out of egypt with signs and wonders by a mighty hand and outstretched arm and with great terror
psalm 136 12 is similar beyond this particular phrase god's hand can be found acting alone
without being combined with his arm for example yahweh's great saving deed in exodus 15 4
pharaoh's chariot and his power he had hurled into the sea your right hand yahweh has done great
wonders your right hand has shattered the enemy this use of god's hand ties in with the theme of
creation god's hand bestowed exceptional power on the prophets first kings 1846 or made great
knowledge available to them isaia 8 11 ezekiel 3 14 god's hand can express protection for example
when it rests on the mountain zion as an isaia 25 10 it can also enclose as an enemy force enclosed
a town psalm 139 5 those who recognize god's hand or power know god and receive a revelation
deuteronomy 3 24 you yahweh you have begun to reveal your greatness and your strong hand to
your servant for what god is there in heaven and on earth who can do the deeds and mighty works you
do texts like this do not aim at a visual perception of god's hand but at a perception of his acting
in the world his deeds for mankind his power in the world god's hands express functional
meaning very similar to human hands we have 218 examples of the hand in anthropomorphism the hand
is the most frequent instrument for god's deeds however the manner in which god's hands act in
the old testament is fundamentally different to that of the humans for it goes far beyond the
possibilities open to people of course he's god god's powers more or less almighty in late text
such as psalms 139 in the post biblical hellenistic context we find a pictorial representation of god's
hands in a fresco from a synagogue in dura europus in around 250 ce despite the fact that we never
hear of god's left hand in the old testament we see both hands here some 1973 both your hands
have made me since this is certainly not a cult image an image of this sort is evidently possible
in a more liberal interpretation of the prohibition of imagery early christendom was of the same opinion
god's feet
the ark of the covenant as mentioned in first chronicles 28 to serves as a footstool under
god's feet symbolizing its subjection to yahweh's dominion similarly psalm 132 7 invites the faithful
worship at god's footstool which is indicative of his dwelling place first chronicles 28 to
i had intended to build a permanent home for the ark of the covenant of the lord for the footstool
of our god psalm 132 7 let us go to his dwelling place let us worship at his footstool the theme
of subjugation extends further in text that describes zion itself as god's footstool indicating
the total submission of this sacred space to divine rule lamentations to one how the lord has
covered the daughter of zion with the cloud of his anger he has hurled down the splendor of israel
from heaven to earth he has not remembered his footstool in the day of his anger psalm 995
exalt the lord our god and worship at his footstool he is holy isaas 66 one expands this concept
to cosmic scale asserting that the entire earth is god's footstool isaas 66 one this is what the
lord says heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool where is the house you will build for me
where will my resting place be these passages collectively underscore the omnipotence of yahweh
suggesting that nothing on earth can escape his dominion this idea is echoed throughout the old
testament even during the exile era challenging earlier scholarly perspectives that viewed biblical
anthropomorphism as antiquated furthermore ezekiel 43 7 emphasizes not only god's power but
also his tangible presence among the israelites linking the anthropomorphic imagery to divine
eminence ezekiel 43 7 he said to me son of man this is the place of my throne and the place of the
souls of my feet this is where i will live among the israelites forever this interpretation finds
a parallel in ancient nearestran culture as demonstrated by the temple of eindara in syria
where large footprints carved into the threshold from the ninth eighth century bce
suggest a similar symbolic representation of a deity's presence and power this same footprint
is what inspired dr stavrak apulu's book cover these biblical texts rich with anthropomorphic
imagery offer profound insights into the evolving understanding of the divine character emphasizing
both the extreme power and the palpable presence of god within the community of his believers
and his real presence was as real to them as their real presence is to each other this activity by
the god or gods is not unique to the biblical god it is described by all other ancient nearestran
deities and depicted in stone at eindara if we applied the same theologizing to these other
deities then we would come up with ways to try making them only into metaphysical beings with
corporeal reality another way to put it if god doesn't have actual feet to these ancients god
would have been dead to them later on people found ways to think out of the very real expectation
of these gods having bodies god's arms the functional meaning of human arms provide a vital
context for understanding biblical references to the arms of god treating them as real and active
forces in the world this conception enhances our appreciation of the scriptures that speak of god's
arm as a direct expression of his power and protection in the hebrew bible god's arm is
particularly significant in safeguarding and delivering the israelites the phrase with a
mighty hand and outstretched arm repeatedly appears in deuteronomy and in referenced in
later text Jeremiah 32 21 Psalm 136 12 these references highlight god's intervention during
the exodus notably described in Jeremiah 32 21 and you yahweh brought your people israel
out of egypt with signs and wonders by a mighty hand and an outstretched arm and with great terror
additionally god's arm is depicted as actively combating the forces of chaos for example
psalm 8910 illustrates this action you crushed rahab one of the chaos dragons like one of the
slain with your strong arm this theme extends to the acts of creation and governance portraying god's
arm as an agent of both creation and ongoing governance which maintains order and life god's
role as a divine warrior is also underscored by reference to his arm with verses such as exodus
15 16 and psalm 79 11 89 11 89 14 highlighting his might in battle this portrays yahweh as a
warrior deity a concept that traces back to the earliest worship practices and continues into
later eras furthermore the arm of yahweh is necessary for enforcing justice as stated in isaia
51 5 it's sometimes addressed as if it were a person emphasizing its active role as an isaia
51 9 awake clothe yourself with strength you arm of yahweh revealing his arm helps make god
comprehensible to foreign peoples as suggested in isaia 52 10 in a more pastoral role god's arm
is likened to a shepherd gathering his flock illustrated in isaia 40 verse 11 he tends his
flock like a shepherd he gathers the lambs in his arms and carries them close to his heart this
nurturing gesture contrasts with his martial and creative functions collectively these depictions
of god's arms illustrate his active involvement and dynamic presence in the world akin to the real
and functional roles of human arms this perspective underscores god's extensive capabilities that
far surpassed those of humans embracing protection creation justice and revelation
another way to put it if these portrayals were all just metaphors and god was just a concept
or abstract entity with no real body then it's an odd way to constantly depict this deity especially
when these same concepts are used for all other gods of the ancient near east in hebrew the expression
of power and mighty deeds often utilizes verbs that focus on the specific functions of the arm
hand and foot this linguistic approach personalizes the concept of power and sovereignty suggesting
a close relationship between power and powerful persons implying that power cannot exist in the
absence of a powerful agent this perspective is not limited to human societal structures
but extends to our understanding of the divine power particularly the might and actions of god
for instance the functions attributed to different parts of the body in biblical language are as
follows the right hand and hands are generally associated with performing deeds the arm is
involved in action emphasizing the execution of deeds the foot symbolizes not only action but
also power and presence scriptural references to god's hands arms and feet highlight his active
role in the world and his continual interventions on behalf of humanity thus it is logical to conceive
of god in a bodily form how else could he act in the human realm if not through some form of physical
agency god's face in hebrew the portrayal of divine power often involves vivid descriptions
that employ physical features such as the face panim to convey expression and communication
this is notably apparent in biblical proverbs such as in proverb 1615 which states
when a king's face panim brightens it means life his favor is like a spring rain cloud the king's
mood and favor are visibly manifested in his countenance underscoring the link between his
facial expressions and his benevolent or wrathful dispositions this use of panim to depict
communication is extended to divine interactions illustrating how god's face conveys his intentions
and emotions for example the benevolent aspect of god's face is highlighted in blessings and
prayers for divine favor number six 24 through 26 articulates a blessing that invokes god's
luminous face for grace and peace bright light of god psalm 67 1 and 80 verse 3 and 19 repeatedly
call for god to make his face shine upon his people associating his visible approval with
salvation and favor conversely the absence or version of god's face signifies disfavor or
judgment as illustrated in verse kings 21 4 and Jeremiah 21 where god's turned face foreshadows
doom the frequent biblical invocation to seek his face psalm 278 emphasizes a direct personal
relationship with god suggesting an individual's pursuit of divine presence and guidance this is
contrasted with broader calls for communal or general seeking of god as seen in amos 5 4
which lacks the intimate connotation of seeking god's face think why seek god's face if they
didn't believe god had a face is it really metaphors all the way down the use of panim in
scriptures often replaces pronouns or nouns pointing to a dynamic interaction rather than a
static presence or an example psalms 100 verse 2 encourages worship before his countenance with
gladness highlighting an expectation of communicative response from god unlike references that might
simply acknowledge his majesty or authority thus the functional use of panim in biblical texts
not only enriches the depiction of god but also emphasizes the potential for communicative and
relational dynamics between the divine and humanity this use of corporeal imagery serves to convey
complex theological concepts of god's active engagement and responsiveness making the divine
more accessible and relatable through the familiar lens of human expression and interaction
god's eyes
eyes serve as a vital instrument for absorbing information and facilitating communication
a concept that extends even to the depiction of god in biblical texts this notion is poignantly
expressed in psalm 94 9 which rhetorically asks does he who implanted the ear not hear
does he who formed the eye not see this verse underscores the belief that the creator
who fashioned the organs of sense is all perceiving and all hearing further illustrating the
communicative function of god's eyes psalms 34 15 states the eyes of the lord are on the righteous
and his ears are attentive to their cry this parallelism between god's eyes and ears
emphasizes his attentiveness and responsiveness to human needs the motif of divine observation
also encompasses the idea of testing and examination as seen in psalm 139 this psalm
describes god's omniscient glaze which penetrates the most intimate aspects of human existence
my frame was not hidden from you when i was made in the secret place when i was woven together
in the depths of the earth your eyes saw my unformed body all the days ordained for me were
written in your book before one of them came to be this suggests not only god's awareness but also
his foreknowledge and planning for each life additionally god's vigilant oversight is portrayed
as protective as an ezra 55 where it is stated but the eye of their god was watching over the
elders of the jews so that they were not stopped until a report could go to derrius and his written
reply be received similarly psalms 33 18 declares but the eyes of the lord are on those who fear him
on those whose hope is in his unfailing love linking divine surveillance with safeguarding
in favor the concept of a deity endowed with multiple eyes as found in some ancient egyptian
representations symbolizes a capacity to see everything simultaneously a visual metaphor
for omniscience unlike these depictions old testament anthropomorphism typically does not
attribute god with many eyes but rather portrays him with human like features that suggest an
enhanced form of vision this depiction fosters a sense of familiarity and relatability allowing
believers to view god as a discernible and approachable entity yet his superior vision
denotes the profound gulf between divine and human capabilities this balance maintains god's
transcendence while affirming his intimate involvement in the world god's ears
the concept of divine hearing and its implications for communication between god and humanity
is a recurrent theme in the old testament this motif underscores the belief that god is actively
listening to human supplications a notion vividly illustrated through various scriptures
numbers 11 18 consecrate yourselves for tomorrow and you shall eat meat or you have web in the
hearing of the lord saying who will give us meat to eat for it was well with us in egypt
therefore the lord will give you meat and you shall eat som 10 17 oh lord you hear the desire
of the afflicted you will strengthen their heart you will incline your ear soms 116
because he inclined his ear to me therefore i will call on him as long as i live these
passages suggest that god is not only a passive observer but actively engages by listening to
the cries and prayers of his people for example psalms 116 2 reflects the personal assurance
that god hears individual prayers facilitating a direct line of communication further psalms
9211 expands on this theme my eyes have seen the downfall of my enemies my ears have heard the
doom of my evil assailants this indicates that god's awareness extends beyond direct appeals
he is cognizant of all earthly events the responsiveness of god to the cries of the
afflicted is emphasized in verses like psalm 10 17 through 18 where the pleas of the destitute
are particularly heightened this responsive aspect of divine hearing suggests that hearing
is synonymous with answering archaeological findings contribute to our understanding of
this motif for instance steely's depicting the ears of the deity amen re symbolize the
divine reception of prayers these artifacts such as the limestone steely from thebes illustrate
worshipers like by depicted kneeling before amen who is represented as a ram indicating
his readiness to receive and respond to human petitions this imagery reinforces the theological
concept that the divine senses ears eyes and face are not just passive features but active channels
through which god engages with humanity the abundance of divine ears in some artworks
underscores the deity's omnipresent ability to hear and respond to multiple or a multitude
of supplications simultaneously thus in the biblical context the act of hearing by god
is an active dynamic engagement that affirms his ongoing involvement in the world and his
responsive relationship with humanity these other worshipers believed their gods were listening with
real ears on their bodies but are we to believe Yahweh doesn't have ears in the minds of the
ancient Israelites check out this crenellated model tower depicting god patah holding what was a
scepter before an offering table women in adoration before ears on the other side it's an 18th dynasty
from Egypt the petri museum of egyptian archaeology they were depicted to various deities
such as patah hathor or amen rey who were also defined as he she who listens to prayers they
believe the deities were real bad bodies and actually could hear to listen to the prayers
and supplications again i asked the question so does Yahweh have ears and listen to the prayers
of his worshipers at least in the minds of the believers he does god's nose
god often includes anthropomorphic features such as the nose which is directly associated with the
expression of divine wrath like in genesis 821 the lord smelled the pleasing aroma and set in his
heart never again will i curse the ground because of humans even though every inclination of the
heart is evil from childhood and never again will i destroy all living creatures as i have done
are we to pretend that Yahweh didn't smell the burnt offering in the minds of these authors
fun fact the earlier myths that the bible clearly is influenced by show the gods and inlil as smelling
the aroma of utnipishtim sacrifice after the flood and the smell softening inlil's heart
because he was hungry this was understood in a very real sense this physical attribute of god
is not merely symbolic but is described in a manner that attributes human like qualities to the divine
in this verse above from genesis the reference to god's nose is explicitly linked to expressions
of anger and fury illustrating the direct and potent response of god to human actions the use
of the nose to signify anger emphasizes that god possesses physical features and experiences
emotional responses similar to humans the focus on god's nose particularly in the context of divine
wrath contrasts with other bodily references that made to note more benign or nurturing aspects
of god's relationship with humanity the old testament frequently portrays god's wrath
as a reaction to disobedience or sin suggesting a dynamic and responsive relationship between
the divine and human realms additionally the impact of god's wrath is significant themes and
scripture and it's demonstrated in the plea for mercy found in psalm 85 5 will you be angry with
us forever will you prolong your anger through all generations this verse conveys the deep
concern and fear among humans regarding the enduring nature of god's anger it's a human
like emotion reflecting the serious consequences of divine displeasure through these descriptions
the old testament portrays god as possessing a real human like nose which functions as a critical
medium for expressing his judicial and emotional reactions to human behavior this anthropomorphic
portrayal helps to convey the intensity of god's interactions with humanity and underscores the
moral expectations god has for his people god's mouth
the mouth of god is depicted as an essential instrument or divine communication enabling
god to interact with and command the natural and human world this concept is vividly illustrated
in several biblical passages that highlight the unique and powerful nature of god's speech
isaia 55 11 so is my word that goes out from my mouth it will not return to me empty but will
accomplish what i desire and achieve the purpose for which i sent it this verse emphasizes the
efficacy and potency of god's word differentiating it significantly from human speech unlike human
words which might fail to achieve their intended effects every word that god speaks is purposeful
and successful in fulfilling its intended outcome or at least the author thinks so
though we have references in the mouth of yahweh that fail and this is where apocalypticism
and other claims kind of falsify some of the ideas of the biblical god but proverbs 8 29 says when he
gave the sea its boundaries so that the waters would not overstep his command and when he marked out
the foundations of the earth here the mouth of god through his command establishes the fundamental
order of creation the divine words set boundaries for the sea a symbol of chaos and outlines the
earth's foundations this passage underscores that god's commands are authoritative over all creation
not just humanity the portrayal of god's mouth in these scriptures points to a profound ability
to speak and enact change through language a capacity that belongs solely to the divine
god's spoken word is not merely instructive but performative affecting what it declares and
maintaining order within the cosmos thus god's mouth is more than a feature it is a testament to
his sovereign power and active participation in the world he governs the person in the back
raises their hand and says see the biblical god is the only a deity that by his word he creates
and has power just by speaking well i'm glad you made this statement so i can quote dr frederick
el more orty from boston college who wrote a paper called word as power in the ancient near east
the bible no longer stands alone as witness to this concept in fact the old testament inherited
with only slight modifications this dynamistic notion of the efficacious word applying it according
to its own theological needs and within the limits of its orthodoxy hypostatization of the divine word
for example played little or no part in the old testament whatever may have been its extraordinary
development in the new testament it seems that at the very beginning a magical significance
was attached to the word in the ancient world pronounced under the right circumstances this
word was thought to have irresistible power for good or evil studies in comparative religion
provide countless examples of the word conceived as a magical power by which men could gain
some control over their precarious environment the spells rituals and execrations were so
many techniques by which results were achieved we who make an essential distinction between an
action and a formula right or symbolic act find it hard to understand the mentality of people
for whom such distinctions had little or no meaning since symbol and reality coalesced when the gods
of mesopotamia had conferred kingship upon one of their number marduk they wanted assurance
that marduk's word really had that magical power which brought results they devised a test
they placed a garment in their midst and said to marduk their firstborn oh lord
thy lot is truly highest among the gods command annihilation and existence and may both come true
may thy spoken word destroy the garments then speak again and make it to be intact
he spoke and at his word the garment was destroyed he spoke again the garment reappeared
the gods his fathers seeing the power of his word rejoiced paid homage marduk is king
in Sumerian culture the basis of mesopotamian civilization the dogma of the divine word as
creative power became firmly established all that the creating deity had to do according to this
doctrine was to lay his plans utter the word and pronounce the name this notion of the creative
power of the divine word was probably also the result of an analogical inference based on observation
of human society if a human king could achieve almost all he wanted by command by no more than
what seemed to be the words of his mouth how much more was possible for the immortal and superhuman
deities in charge of the four realms of the universe but perhaps this easy solution of the
cosmological problems in which thought and word alone are so important is largely a reflection
of the drive to escape into hopeful wish fulfillment characteristic of practically all humans in
times of stress and misfortune a bilingual text Sumerian and Akkadian containing a hymn to the
moon god Nana celebrates the power of his word thou when thy word is pronounced in heaven the
prostrate themselves thou when thy word is pronounced on earth the anunnaki kiss the ground
thou when thy word drifts along in heaven like the wind it makes rich the feeding and drinking
of the land thou when thy word settles down on the earth green vegetation is produced
thou thy word makes fat the sheepfold and the stall it makes living creatures widespread
thou thy word causes truth and justice to be so that the people speak the truth
thou thy word which is far away in heaven which is hidden in the earth is something no one sees
thou who can comprehend thy word who can equal it oh lord in heaven as to dominion on earth
as to valor among the gods thy brothers thou has not a rival a text from Babylonian records in the
library of J. Piermont Morgan explicitly associates the word of power with the phenomena of nature
the storm is the word of anu the storm is the word of inlil the storm is the wrath of the great
anu a somewhat more sophisticated notion of the word as something conceived underlies a
difficult passage in the Sumerian exaltation of Nana in Houdouana princess of priestess and poetess
seems to describe her magnificent creative effort in this hymn to the goddess as something to
which she gave birth the word of this hymn was conceived by in Houdouana god's throat neck life
the Hebrew word nefesh commonly translated as soul or life in English carries complex and layered
meanings that can vary significantly based on its biblical context this richness of meaning
presents a challenge in precisely defining the term especially when referring to the divine
nature of god in Jeremiah 6 verse 8 we encounter the term in a particularly intriguing usage
reform Jerusalem before my nefesh turns from you and I make you a desolate land in which no one
can live here nefesh can be interpreted as referring to God's deeply personal and intentional
aspect his will or purpose towards Jerusalem the passage suggests a turning point contingent
upon the city's response to divine admonition highlighting the active and intentional characteristic
of God's nefesh it's not merely about the emotion or disposition but about a decisive
aspect of God's being that can turn towards or away from the people indicating a form of relationship
that involves presence attention and intention the notion that nefesh encompasses the self
in its most intense form of intentionality is pivotal for god nefesh implies vitality and
consciousness attributes that are essential to life and existence much like they are for humans
this similarity between divine and human nefesh underlines a shared foundation for action
and interaction suggesting a common ground in the way both entities exist act and relate
sure we can find differences from the surrounding cults from the region
to that of the biblical text as we now have them the israeli god is the only one not many gods
though we see textual fossils of polytheism and the clear earlier cults practiced polytheism
is this a sign that the later authors are being influenced by persian or greek thinkers getting
away from the depicting their god we also notice the gods have wives and we know from findings in
the region el and yahweh were seen to have a wife ashara though the biblical authors want to scrub
her from the record while the later scribes did some editorial work they never scrubbed god's
physical body from existence as far as the biblical portrayal is concerned every time you find god
depicted you see these clear linguistic signals that the deity is having a body even if he decides
based on author's perception to hide it from people's views the theological portrayal of god's
body in the old testament is nuanced accomplishment that balances the anthropomorphic depiction of
god with the rigorous monotheism characteristic of israelite religion this depiction allows
for the retention of a mental image of god despite strict prohibitions against physical
representations such as statues the portrayal of god using human forms not only makes the
divine concept accessible but also underscores god's transcendent omnipotence highlighting
the unique theological perspective of the old testament this sophisticated portrayal is the
outcome of a lengthy theological evolution within the israelite faith marking various stages of
development and understanding the current understanding is just the beginning of a broader
exploration into these developmental stages transposing the old testament's anthropomorphic
imagery of god directly into modern visual concepts without a reflective and interpretive
process risks distorting these theological intentions such an unexamined transfer could
lead to criticisms of making god too tangible or material which would be a modern misreading
of the original scriptural intent to appreciate the old testament's approach to anthropomorphism
fully it is essential to recognize the historical and cultural context that shaped these portrayals
the biblical images of god were designed to maintain a balance making god approachable communicatable
and potent while also ensuring that he remains inaccessible and holy divine this dual nature
keeps god both imminent and transcendent embodying a theology that holds god in human form as
simultaneously near and far it's clear that god has a body according to the biblical texts
what it is made of depends on the context and when it appears to be physical material like humans
we have no clue exactly what it's made of other times it appears to be made of light
needing to be hidden by dark clouds the bible has so many voices and not all are saying the same
things we have seen how dr francesca stavrakapulu's work fits right in line with other scholars
doing this kind of work the reason she has caught attention by those defenders of god is that
she talks about god functioning in sexual ways including language of rape attributed to yahweh
of course this will upset some who protect the image of their god but was the absolute norm for
all deities in the various regions including the one from which the judians who put the final touches
on this tradition were raised i hope the tedious sections of trying to show ancient depictions
of man in their own artistic fashion correlates to the linguistic depictions of men in the text
inside and outside of the bible well this same language is used for humans as it is for the
divinity of the bible the most natural conclusion is that this god also has a body it's also worth
noting these ancient cultures fused symbolic meaning into the mundane realities of the body
so you can have metaphor or euphemisms that represent body parts as agricultural or architectural
or other phenomenon known to the ancient audience from their period we want to have a better grasp
on what these texts mean when they say something we need to go back in time and piece it together
in this we showed two-dimensional and three-dimensional examples we compared
things that were cross-cultural and tried to bring this god back to life he has truly been
buried under millennia of philosophy with the right tools we could still see his bones
