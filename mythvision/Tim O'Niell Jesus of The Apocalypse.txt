Tim O'Neill joining us today at MythVision Podcast ladies and gentlemen.
He's interesting and I love listening to him because I've learned so much in one podcast
to hear a different perspective.
I'm not used to hearing.
Usually we've entertained mythicists but I want you guys to venture into what the consensus
thinks on things here when it comes to the ideas of history and especially the character
that I once venerated as God in the flesh, Jesus.
Tim O'Neill, welcome to the channel my friend.
Hey Derek, how are you?
Good to be back.
I'm so glad you came and joined me even with the criticism and the comment section man.
I thought that there's no way in hell he's going to come back on the show and hang out
with me.
I've done a few of these interviews and I'm used to that criticism and I had a bit of
fun and I was to admit with some of those critics.
I like to engage with the comments in any direction that I have or any interview or podcast
that I do for a couple of reasons.
First of all because you can never cover the whole topic in even we talk for an hour and
a half last time.
You can never cover this topic and so one of the comments that was made was I didn't like
the way you made off the cuff comments or assertions and didn't back them up.
Well I could have but we would have been there the days if I'd backed up every single one
of those.
So when people said there's this issue I like to engage with that and respond.
I think that's probably just the polite thing to do but I think it's useful.
The other reason I like to interact with those comments is I'm fascinated by why people believe
things and I'm fascinated by particularly why people believe fringe theories and why people
believe what I call bad history or pseudo-history.
So I'm intrigued by those comments and I like to engage with them and say well why are you
saying that?
You know that kind of engagement and interaction is interesting because you don't understand
your own position if you don't understand the other person's point of view.
So I'm actually quite genuine when I am engaging with most of those people.
Some of those people were batshit crazy and I didn't engage so much with some of them
and then there were the people who were just abuseable.
So I got called a jerk, the biggest douchebag on earth, an alcoholic, all this other stuff
which I must admit I did engage with some of those.
I thought some of those were quite funny and I'm a bit cheeky.
So I was like well can you explain why you're calling me the biggest douchebag on earth and
they couldn't because basically that's just the way of dismissing me without actually
engaging with what I'm saying.
So it's really just laziness and then there's the people who even though I made a point
in our last conversation of explaining that I'm not rude, you know sometimes I am a bit
sarcastic and explaining why I'm not going to be polite to people who are rude to me.
And so someone like Richie Carrier who's called me a liar and an idiot and says that I'm
delusionally insane, sorry but I don't see any obligation to be polite to him back.
People who haven't attacked me of course I'm perfectly civil too and specifically civil
about.
But some people were sort of trying to dismiss me by saying well he's been rude about Richie
Carrier therefore we can ignore him and that's just laziness again.
It's just another excuse to not engage with what I'm saying.
But probably the one that I love the most and I get it all the time and I got it three
times in the comments on your last show which is that I'm actually a closet Christian.
Now how anyone can read my blog or watch that video and come to the conclusion that I'm
a closet Christian is beyond me but it's just almost like this irrational reflex.
He's saying things I don't like, he's saying things I don't agree with, fine but so therefore
the only way I can deal with him is by dismissing him as a Christian.
I will read one of those comments, I won't use his name because that would be cruel because
this is so dumb.
This guy said I've just had a look at your blog that's mine and it's obvious that you
are an obsessive Christian apologist masquerading as an atheist.
I couldn't believe that you try to pretend the notorious Josephus passage was partly
not fake.
That's the majority position of most Josephus scholars by the way but for this guy it's
evidence that I'm a Christian.
With your religious affliction you are clearly beyond reason and hopelessly bound to a single
one story so I'm not going to waste any more time on you because you're obviously lying
for Jesus.
Stupid, not beyond stupid but you see it's a tactic, it's basically well I'm not going
to engage with you anymore because I'm dismissing you as a Christian.
I get it all the time, it's really strange.
It's an indication that something other than rationality is driving a lot of these people
because that's just bogus, completely irrational.
So Tim I definitely think and after our last conversation it was like looking in the mirror
for me to really kind of consider how I've been researching and how I've been looking
at these ideas right and I've come around quite a bit to saying you know just because
Jesus may have existed, a guy named Jesus may have existed does not mean he died and
rose again or did anything that it's actually saying in a miraculous scenario so that's
taking quite a bit to try and divorce in my mind if I'm going to be honest and so it's
hard for me to see that and to say is this potentially just a guy at the basis that's
been mythologized and so I hope and look I have no involvement in issues that you've
had with some of the people that I like clearly said are friends of mine, previous shows and
I interview these people like I love all of these guys including you like I don't want to get
involved and I just want to learn and I want to remain a student because you guys all have
something to offer me to learn from whether you think it's something mistaken or not.
If it's a hot topic I want to understand why people believe the way they do as well
but in light of this saying you're a Christian because you deny
mythicism or you think there was a guy I think there is a problem there I think that a lot of
times in my mind I felt the same feeling that they felt early on when I was staunch mythosist
that Bart Ehrman is a secret closet Christian because why would he debate mythosist number one
why doesn't he just concede and say oh you know it's likely no he's kind of like advocated that
he really believes the probability is like extremely high almost certain there was a Jesus and so
is he is he a Christian well it sounds to me when I was hardcore myth this is he's definitely
wearing the pants of a Christian and a shirt of a Christian but he's saying he's not a Christian
kind of hard for me to swallow so you're going to be talking about Jesus today the real apocalyptic
one that you believe is the basis for what became mythologized. Yeah um though I try and I think
I said this last time when I talk about this stuff I try and use the word conclude I don't believe
this is no matter a belief and as I've said before mythicism is possible I just don't think it's
more likely that there was a historical Jesus back up too yeah like a couple sentences it broke out
I'm sorry okay might might go from the top um so so I yeah but I will be talking about a guy
with the word believe when when I'm talking about this stuff because that has really just
overturned so it's not a matter of belief for me it's a matter of conclusion I conclude that it is
most likely that that there was a historical Jesus but you know your point though about
uh about how you used to hear people like him and when you were very much a committed
nonsense I really understand that because for many people when they hear the word Jesus they
think Jesus you know they think that the figure of Christianity the walking on water feeding
the five thousand blessed are the peacemakers died rose from the dead Jesus and and if you
don't have a conception of what the historical Jesus would have most likely have been like
if you don't have that background and that understanding of you know about a good 100 years
of research on on who that person most likely was then then all you've got when you hear the word Jesus
is the Jesus of faith and so a lot of people struggle with that with that concept and particularly
if I'm talking about about the historical Jesus and I'm referring to the New Testament
people again it sounds like I'm talking about the New Testament of Jesus I'm not I'm talking about
how those stories in the New Testament evolved how they arose and obviously the the only
intelligent place to go to to understand how they may have evolved is the New Testament you can't
just ignore it so you have to go and look at and go okay what does this mean where do
what I want to do today is I want to try and give a summary of what non-Christian scholars
people like Bart Ehrman, Paula Fredrickson, Maurice Casey, all of these these people who
form a large block of prominent scholars in the field of what these non-Christian scholars are
talking about when they're talking about Jesus because they're not talking about the Jesus that
you would have heard about in church. If I may Tim before we get into that I just want to bring
up something I thought to add icing to the cake of what you just described is oftentimes as a
mythicist staunch mythicist that I was I mean I've always been open-minded don't get me wrong but
you know you got to grow and gradually hold on to things and then like don't hold on to them too
hard that's just been my philosophies to always try and explore and understand and grab more
information so I haven't ever been a religious mythicist if you will to the point where I'm not
willing to listen I just thought it was it made the most sense to me and one of those things
it's not necessarily the Jesus Christ of faith it's almost like when you go mythicist what you've
done is you've recognized that the Jesus Christ of faith is like a dying rising god or you've compared
him to a Dionysus like Dennis McDonald chose Dr. McDonald chose in his thesis that maybe the
fourth gospel John is like he making Jesus better than Dionysus or Mark and the other gospels might
be mimetically tying into the Homeric epics with Odysseus and the gods and so like it's like you
see all that information the stuff that Christians don't use and you see this comparison to other
divinities and such and you say well they're gods and they're figures so that like you equate Jesus
and you can't divorce him from being divine in the narrative and I mean what is the Doherty
thesis except the fact that he was originally angelic or some divine figure who came down
and then became man and took flesh and such and then of course he goes back up and becomes back
to the divine seated at the right hand and on and on and on so it's like it's that that's it's kind of
that mentality in the mythicist mindset of trying to see the historical guy well they say that's
you hemorrhizing him later and it's not something that was originally human then gradually divine
which I entertain all these ideas on the show but I I kind of wanted to let our audience know
so if it's a mythicist watching which most likely someone who's a mythicist will see this
we'll see and go okay yes I see that so show me the guy at the basis if you take all the divine
stuff out what's left right and you mentioned before the show so anyway and you use the the
term you hemorrhizing so and that's the that's the idea that certainly prevalent in the ancient world
that um yeah we've got these ideas about these gods but originally the the hemorrhage idea is
originally they were humans and they and then those stories became about gods and mythicism
kind of flips that a bit and says well what happened is they believed in this supernatural
celestial mystical being in the in the heavens and then they started telling those stories set
on earth okay now and I'll always acknowledge that that's a possibility I just don't think it's
likely I think it's far more likely than what we get is is another ancient mythological term
apotheosis apotheosis is where you're actually having human that is held up to such an extent
and exalted to such an extent that effectively that they eventually they become gods and apotheosis
is actually much more common in both the ancient Mediterranean world but also in religions generally
we have lots and lots of examples of humans who get exalted to the point where they are
virtually gods or you know in the case of Muhammad or who who actually become become gods or become
worshiped as gods happen in the ancient world all the time um they deified most of their emperors
for example in ancient Rome so so is it is it a humorism or is it is it apotheosis I would argue
it's apotheosis so yes you you do get to a point in Christianity where there are a lot of similarities
between Jesus and those gods of those mystery cults and so on because he'd been raised via
apotheosis to that point where he was at the same level but that doesn't mean there wasn't an
original historical guy who had that apotheosis process so maybe we should talk about who he might
have been okay so so I think probably what what what I always stress when it comes to history is
that you can't understand history unless you understand context the whole of historical analysis
is is looking at evidence but looking at it in context so if we look at the context
out of which Christianity arose Christianity arose everyone agrees Christianity arose originally
as a Jewish sect so it began as a as a as a not as a new religion that sprang out of nothing it
began as a Jewish sect and there were a lot of Jewish sects around in in the period that we
referred to as second temple Judaism and and the period just after so the period just leading up to
70 AD which was when the temple was destroyed in the first Jewish war when the Jews rebellion
against the Romans got pretty savagely quashed and Jerusalem was was sacked and the temple was
was wrecked and that was that was the the the beginning of the end for for that Jewish homeland
until quite recently so so what was going on in that period it's a period that we also referred
to as the inter-testamental period because it's it's the period between the the date of the last
books of the Old Testament and the first books of the of the New Testament so the first books of
the New Testament being the letters of Paul so that's about 50 AD so it's a period of about 200
years or so in which in which we we do have writings but none of them actually not none of it actually
found its way into any Bible Christian or Jewish so it's inter-testamental in the sense that it's
between the two testaments but the amazing thing about it is that a hell of a lot happened in that
period it happened in the Mediterranean world generally particularly the Eastern Mediterranean
but it happened within the world of Judaism as well as a result of of everything that was
happening around them so if you think about the the Judaism of of the Old Testament world
is one where you have the Jews seeing themselves as chosen people of God they're the the chosen
people of Yahweh Yahweh is their God originally they were kind of more sort of what we call
hynotheistic which is well there are other gods but our God is the is our God and our God is the
best one but it was becoming much much more sort of monotheistic so those other gods don't exist
or their demons our God is the only god that exists so you had a kind of like a monotheistic
Judaism that believed that they were the chosen people and they were living in the promised land
and what happened was every now and then you'd have a renewal of that and but on the whole that was
that was reasonably well established what happened in the inter-testamental period was that changed
quite a bit because what had been happening for centuries is that the Jews kept getting conquered
and it's all very well to sort of say we have the chosen people and this is our promised land but
when the Assyrians and then the Babylonians and then the Persians and then then Alexander the
greats Macedonian Greeks and then the successor kingdoms so the Ptolemy's and then the Sleucids
and then after a very very brief period of independence the Romans wave after wave after
wave of conquerors keep coming through and conquering the so-called chosen people in and
conquering the promised land it gets to the point where people start to think well hang on
how is this meant to be working with if we're the chosen people and this is the promised land
why don't we keep getting our asses kicked by all these non-Jewish people now what we find in the
Old Testament is prophets saying well it's because you're very very bad you're very wicked you keep
turning away from Yahweh and as a result these waves of invaders are coming in as God's punishment
and what you need to do is turn back to God that that kind of worked for a while but by the time
you get to the near this intertestamental period it was that that was starting to wear a little
bit thin so some people started to to think well there's got to be a permanent solution
to this something is going on in the universe that has to change something else that was
happening at the same time was a lot of influence from some of those invading peoples
on Judaism now the Jews were trying to maintain the the integrity and what they saw as the
purity of their original faith but but what we see when we even when we look at the Old Testament
is changes happening within Judaism so one of the things that was changing as I just mentioned
they went from a henotheism to a more strict monotheism but the other thing that was going
on was that they got a lot of influence from the Persian religions particularly Zoroastrianism
so the Zoroastrians believed that the universe was a a cosmic battle between light and darkness
they were dualists so they believed that there was a a good god and there was an evil god
and and the world was in in the struggle between the two that influenced Judaism quite a bit and
so what we start to see is we start to see the rise of an idea that there was an evil principle
or even principles in the universe and that they were behind this affliction that the Jewish people
were kept experiencing and so Satan who originally in the in the Old Testament is not you know the
bad guy who is trying to overthrow God he's like he's one of God's good guys he's the he's the the
the the guy who who tests people like in the book of Joe Satan that gets turned into a version of
Ariman who was the it was the evil god in in Persian mythology so Satan's role changes
Satan becomes the evil power the leader of the evil powers in the universe the the idea that
there were other gods who were actually actually not really gods that that again gets gets absorbed
into some Greek ideas by Alexander the Great's conquest of of of daemonids of demons we call
the demons and we think of you know devils with horns and stuff but these were cosmic powers some
evil some good some neutral most neutral in in Judaism that they became absorbed and so they
became the the the agents of of the of the evil power the agents of Satan and then other concepts
such as the concept of hell the concept of there being a eventual eternal punishment for the wicked
gets gets bought in from both versions from both Persian and from Greek mythology so so
Judaism changes quite a bit early first century about the time of of Jesus is quite different
from the Judaism of say 250 or 300 years before it has this huge influence from both Greek and
Persian mythology and there's this idea that that there is a battle on between good and evil
and the Jews are in the middle now but they're on the but they're on the on the side of good
but what they have to do is they have to they have to help God too and the and his angels
angels become big in this period as well they have to help God and his angels defeat the powers of
evil so so there's a mythology a kind of a theology of a final cosmic battle something else
that's going on in the background of course is that there's this nostalgia for the period centuries
before where the Jews had their own kings because all that has now completely collapsed with the
with the you know the Babylonian captivity that effectively ended so there's a nostalgia for that
and there's a there's also the kind of this um there's this sort of legendarium of uh eventually
one day a descendant of King David will arise and and he'll be our king again so this is
sort of working alongside this rising mythology of a great last cosmic battle that's the anointed one
the Messiah the Messiah the Messiah so eventually a Messiah will arise he'll be a descendant of
King David he'll be a human being and he will he will lead us in the final in the final battle against
against the the evil and then there's there was also an idea well okay if all this is going to
happen eventually that's fine for the the generation that's living then when the final cosmic battle
happens and the Messiah and the angels defeat Satan and the devils and and then there's a
there's a last judgment what about all the people who died in the meantime that's not really that's
not really fair so some people not everyone but some people in in the Judaism of the intertester
mental period came up with the idea of a general resurrection so they they came up with the idea
that eventually what what would happen at the at the the when the apocalypse the last days came
was that god would raise everyone from the dead and so it wasn't just the generation that was alive
then that would benefit from from this this final cosmic cosmic victory but everyone would be judged
according to how they had lived and so and then the the righteous who who had lived well they would
live in this renewed earth renewed with a renewed heaven in the kingship of god or what was called
the kingdom of god and the others would be banished punished burnt for eternal
different interpretations but something bad would happen to them and and good things would
happen to the to the righteous this was the the theology that had arisen now not everyone
believed in all of it not and there were some people who didn't believe in any of it so you
can't sort of say all Jews believed that there was going to be a messiah that's if that's not clear
but there were many people who believed most of these elements and some who believed in all of them
that's the context so if you were a peasant in Galilee in the early first century AD
you were your life was pretty hard effectively you're you you were under two levels of oppression
so your direct ruler was one of the sons of Herod Herod Antibas and and he he was a bad guy
who was the son of a bad guy the Herods were were great rulers but they were great rulers in the way
that many ancient rulers were and that they were pretty oppressive so if you went along with the
regime fine if you paid your taxes okay but if you stepped out of line then then you would you would
you would be punished pretty pretty rapidly one of the things that the Herod's quite like to do
is to live pretty well and so their taxation so back to Herod's live quite well okay so one of the
things about the Herods is that they they tended to live quite well they lived in luxury they had some
beautiful palaces and so on it was very much like the the one percent you know they were they were
the mega rich everyone else was pretty poor and so they they had a high level of taxation it's estimated
that a peasant in this period would have paid about one third of their income in tax and it's not
like they're getting roads schools and hospitals for that they're just giving that money to Herod
and his and his family Herod's then giving a huge cut of it to the Roman Empire because Herod was a
the Herod's were were client kings the Romans had a very efficient system where they didn't rule the
the entire empire directly they had networks patchworks of client kingdoms where basically
they say okay we'll look after you if the Persians attack we'll send in the legions you give us a cut
of your of your taxes and and we're sweet so it's like a protection racket it's like you know you pay
up and and your kingdom won't get broken right um this made that these poor peasants got taxed
really really heavily and paying one third of your income is hard enough in a good year in a bad year
and these people were subsistence level farmers in many respects um you could your family would
starve so this was this was really really tough times so if you can imagine that situation you
got these devout Jews who believe many of them that they're in the coming towards the end
satan them devout Druze that are coming toward the end so so this is the situation you've got
these devout Jews who believe that in many senses they're coming towards the end of a centuries-long
cosmic battle that's coming to a climax very very soon where the forces of satan and his demons are
going to be fighting the messiah and and god and and and his angels they and at the same time they're
living under what they believe to be and what what was a highly repressive regime which in turn
is beholden to a pagan and non-jewish and therefore evil regime the romans you can sort of see why
these guys would be open to a message where someone says it's going to be over soon it's all going to
be okay um we're going to go through and the apocalypse and that's going to be hard uh and lots
of lots of suffering and so on there but but if you are righteous and if you live the right way and
if you if you if you come out on the the other side on the side literally on the side of the angels
then then you will inherit the the kingdom of god you will inherit this kingship of god god is going
to reassert himself in the world they believe that the world was currently under the domination of
satan they believe that the world was dominated by demons they believe that they were waiting to be
released almost like prisoners released from this oppression and that this was all coming very very
very soon so if a guy let's call him yeshua which is the aromatic name that we we now use
we now use the the english form jesus but if this guy yeshua turned up in your village let's say you're
in a village like cappernum in in gully and he turned up and he said something along the lines of
the kingship of god that that is coming is near at hand repent and believe in this good news
that would be a message that you would kind of think that sounds pretty good to me this guy
seems to know what he's talking about so if we look at the very very first gospel gospel of mark
what we find if we strip out all the stuff that's about jesus walking on water and all the miracles
and so on we find a story that is effectively about the kind of preacher who is preaching this message
a kind of preacher who is saying it's almost it's almost days away it's happening very very soon
and so what we find even when we turn to um some of the the writings of the time
we find that that that message that it was going to be coming very very soon was was pretty much
dominant so if you have a look at four Ezra um which is which was one of the books not not a
biblical book but a book that was written in that inter-testamental period for Ezra 861 the age is
hurrying swiftly to its end judgment is now drawing near or second barrel the advent of the
times is very short the end which the most high prepared is near so this is the message that was
around at the time and then if you look at mark 115 it's what i just said you know the kingdom of god
is near at hand repent and believe in this good news and and the idea that it was going to happen
very soon in their lifetimes or very soon you know within within a few years possibly any day now
that was pretty strong at at that in any of this preaching as well and we find that in the synoptic
gospels as well it gets we'll come to this later on it gets watered down because it didn't happen
but in the earliest traditions that are preserved in the gospels we find things like mark 91 truly
i tell you there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see that kingdom of god
come with power remember the kingdom of god isn't a place it isn't heaven it's the rule of god it's the
the actual word is baselios the rule the the the ruling of god the kingship of god and then in
again we find truly i tell you this generation will not pass away until all these things have happened
that's mark 13th 1330 and matthew you know he sends them out to all of these towns to preach
and he says when they persecute you in one town flee to the next but truly i tell you you will
have not gone through all the towns of israel before the son of man comes so he's not talking
about in these he's not being depicted as talking about something that's going to happen 2000 years
what he's not talking about something that might happen one day he's
he's gonna might happen within you as a kind of a moral thing he's talking about an apocalypse
and it's gonna happen any day now and this gets preserved i have to comment on that because i think
you just glitched out for one word but i i can piece it here you are saying this has no internal
spiritualization meaning in its initial context in the earliest forms within the synoptics that
we have which john is late we let's all just get on the same bandwagon here mark is saying guys a
real life physical god is going to come down he's going to dwell with his people probably a
rod to the Gentiles or at least you know in whatever god's way might be to to bring them in
or he might destroy him whatever either way because paula fredersen does a fantastic job
in her book paul the pagans apostle where she says look there's a it's kind of like schizophrenia
god's kind of got a bipolar message whereas like in the old testament you or heber scriptures
he's saying you look uh i'm going to bring the rod to him kick there you know what and then in
other places it's like more of an optimistic outcome for him and so she says she thinks paul
which is the earliest new testament writer is saying look he believes a both he believes that
god has a good salvation plan of like bringing them to come to israel to learn the ways of god
except if they don't that's where the judgment comes in and they're going to get you know what
they're what whooped you know so anyways i just wanted to make that and and that concept isn't
really sort of unique to paul we see elements of it in this earlier literature as well so this
idea that a lot of people have that paul was this radical who who broke broke completely
from from jewish context he didn't and there's some really good stuff paula fredersen is is
probably one of the leading proponents of putting paul in in his jewish context as well though he
he certainly did come up with some with some interesting new ideas but yeah yeah the whole
idea if you look at at um a lot of the parables which a lot of people a lot of modern christians
read as being about we must live our lives well so we can go to heaven that's not what they're
about they're about we must we must repent and believe because the kingdom of god is coming any
day and so it's urgent that we change the way in which we live and yeah we have to be kind and we
have to be meek and we have to be all that stuff that moral teaching was definitely there but the
reason for it was um the kingdom of god is coming the apocalypse is coming and so you get all these
these stuff about um you know the parable of the bridesmaids for example and the and the the
moral of that is keep awake therefore for you know neither the day nor the hour he's talking about
you don't know when the apocalypse is going to come it could come any day any hour um same in in
luke 12 36 be dressed for action have your lamps lit be like those waiting for the master to return
from the wedding banquet banquet so they can open the door for him as soon as he comes and knocks
this is all uh it is all very much part of the apocalyptic tradition and we find it all around
in this period and so of course we find it in in the earliest traditions about jesus and and then
when you when you look at what the apocalypse is going to be yeah it's not some sort of inner
you know the spiritual thing it's armies of angels in the sky this is what we've got to get
right they genuinely believe that armies of angels were going to appear in the sky with god
and the messiah was was going to give us kind of going to ascend or descend one of the two
and and there was going to be there was going to be a battle and it was going to be bad you know for
for nation will rise against nation kingdom against kingdom there'll be famines and earthquakes
there'll be great suffering the sun will be dark and the moon will not give its light the stars will
fall from the heaven this is this is all this stuff from in in the eson optics so it's in in
particularly in uh mark 13 which is like a little apocalypse but again none of this is
original to to jesus if this is what jesus said or anything like what he said because we find
exactly the same stuff in this other literature of the time and we find it in daniel you know there
will be a time of suffering so it just never occurred since the nations first came into
existence so we also find it in you know another inter-testamental book that's not in the bible
called zephaniah so zephaniah one the great day of the lord is near near and hastening fast a day
of darkness a day of gloom a day of clouds a day of trumpet blast and battle cry the world will be
will be consumed and a terrible end will be made of all the inhabitants of the earth so so again the
the the stuff that jesus is depicted as saying is not original it's not new okay so it's not
i am god it's definitely not that it's armies of angels are going to come come down in the
sky and fight a last cosmic battle um nations will be destroyed millions of people will die
but the righteous will survive and live in a renewed earth this is this is it's absolutely what he's
talking about why is this good news um the the word in the gospels that's used is is iwangelion
which which we translate as good news but it's actually the origin of the word gospel
you know they're called the gospels because they are the good news so how is this good news
millions of people are going to die in a great cataclysm that's coming any day now well the
reason it's good news is that if you are on the the right side then everything is going to be better
and one of the the key messages in this inter-testamental literature was that
up will be down and down will be up the the low will be raised high and the and the high will be
will be bought low now if you're a peasant and you're paying one third of your your income to
fucking herod and he's made so it's sitting around in a palace you know quaffing iced wine
that feels pretty good right the idea that the rich will be made will be humbled and the poor
will be raised up and this is why there's so much stuff in the gospels about the poor
there's so much stuff about the rich being bad people and the poor being you know the humble
being being getting getting raised up because they are righteous and we find this throughout
this inter-testamental literature as well one of the Dead Sea Scrolls is talking about you know
you you have raised me up and have let me enter the congregation of the sons of heaven there's
this idea that there'll be this changing of the world order where where the everything will be
reversed and one of the most most well-known bits in the in the New Testament is the Beatitudes
right so blessed are the poor in spirit there's the kingdom of heaven blessed are the meek and so on
a lot of Christians these days sort of sort of take that as being a kind of a consolation if you
if you're a bit down in the dumps God will make you feel better you know if you if you if you're
not having a good time Jesus will make you feel better that's not what he's talking about this
is a prophecy the poor in spirit will will attain the kingdom of heaven they will they will be the
ones who who attain the renewed earth the those who mourn they'll be comforted those who are meek
they'll inherit the earth right the meek means poor lowly okay what happens after your pockets
they'll inherit the earth all the richer bastards the herods they're in hell right so this is what
it's all about blessed are the merciful because they will receive mercy blessed are those who are
pure in heart that they will see God he's talking about after the apocalypse and one of the things
that Christians who like to emphasize the you know the gentle Jesus meek and mild part of the of
the Beatitudes and don't see it as a prophecy or don't understand it as a prophecy is they ignore
the fact that in Luke there's a bit where Jesus goes from saying blessed are these people to
issuing a series of curses which you don't hear much about in church woe to those who are rich
but you have already received your consolation after the apocalypse bad luck pal right woe to
you who are full now for you will be hungry woe to you woe to you who are laughing now for you
will mourn and weep woe to you and speak people speak well of you but that's what their ancestors
so this is a message that's good news because if you are one of these poor peasants is meek and
poor and and suffering and resenting the herods and the Romans it's all going to get reversed
it's a powerful message it's a message of of not just spiritual but also political
liberation but not in the sense of we're going to rise up and fight the Romans in the sense of
soon God will sweep away everything including the the fucking Roman empire and renew the earth
and we will inherit the earth so you can see why people saw it as a good message and you can see
why some people would have followed Jesus now thousands of people will know that's what the
gospel's claim is pretty unlikely but enough probably enough but I think the point that I
really want to emphasize is that when you when you look at this stuff in the gospel's in this
context it all makes sense right so you start to see Jesus not as this you know this this
preacher of love and peace you know the what I call the hippie Jesus and you certainly don't see
the Jesus of John the last gospel which is I am God and and the prophets were talking about me
and what I'm preaching is not the coming of the apocalypse but the coming of me
what you're getting is Jesus talking about pretty much being an apocalyptic preacher this stuff is
coming very very soon now obviously the gospels are written by people who had come to believe that
Jesus was the Messiah in some sense whether Jesus thought that about himself or not is a matter of
going to bow so it could be that Jesus didn't it could be that Jesus didn't but then came to
it could be that Jesus did but he kept that kind of quiet because that would get you crucified
as he learned or it could be that he didn't at all and that was something that only came after he
was crucified as a way of trying trying to make sense of why the great prophet had just been
crucified it's really hard to tell and you could you can actually make cases for for any of those
scenarios but certainly what you find in the in the synoptic gospels the first three gospels
particularly Mark the earliest gospel is very much Jesus as a prophet Jesus not claiming to be God
he does not claim to be God despite what Christians try to claim he does not claim to be God anywhere
in in in the gospel of Mark and what he is saying though is quite this insistent message
the kingship of God is coming very very soon and he's he's so urgent about it that he ends up
going to Jerusalem we're saying this kind of stuff tends to get you in a little bit more trouble
and so not surprisingly he gets arrested and he gets crucified and this was a risk that anyone who
was preaching this sort of of message was going to run run up close to you because
saying that the roman empire is going to get swept away by an army of angels and saying that the
roman empire is going to get swept away by an army of jews the romans didn't care too much about the
fine theological difference whatever you're saying you're talking about us being swept away so you
know he's he's three nails off your go yeah does all that make sense yeah tim this is um wonderfully
put because it makes one really try to i don't know you got to think differently than what you're
used to uh thinking if you're a christian of course you really you really don't uh too often we
marry things as christians everything connects everything's because we have this uh invisible
inherent infallacy concept in our head and we kind of connect mark and john and paul and they all
mean the same and they're all on the same page and stuff like that and when you become critical you
start realizing things like the rift between james and paul that we made common of before on the last
episode or we start looking at mark and say why is this the most primitive why is john coming out
the gate saying i was there at the creation i am the word which through god created and i am god
you find none of that in mark right i mean when i when i say to christians jesus in mark never
never claims to be god they always object and they always say well what about this but it's
always interesting they have very little that they can work with in mark to try and make the
case that is the same jesus that you find in the jesus as the jesus of john so the probably the one
thing that they jump on is there's that story in mark where a paralyzed guy gets lowered down through
the roof while jesus i think he's in capernaum and and jesus goes to heal him by forgiving his
sins and of course there's always this chorus of Pharisees who seem to pop up at every given moment
they were hanging around so the chorus of Pharisees poke their heads around the door and say aha
only god can forgive sins what are you saying and jesus says to prove to you that the son of
man can forgive sins ask any terms of the paralegal i says you seem to be forgiven and he gets up and
walks right now christians interpret that as jesus saying to prove to you that i am god
if he gives his sins he gets up and walks but that's not what the text says what the text actually
says is they say only god can forgive sins he disagrees with them and says no the son of man
which means is both the title of the messiah and also is a roundabout way of saying a man me
so to prove to you that i can forgive sins not just god i forgive your sins and he gets up and
walks so what the what the mark story is doing is it's proving that jesus is the messiah and
is given the right to forgive sins by god he's not saying that he's god he disagrees with them
so so even when the christians try to come up with ways in which the the jesus of mark is
actually claiming divine power he he definitely isn't in mark when jesus gets baptised by john the
baptist it's really interesting to compare that story to the story in john because in john what
happens is john the baptist says this is going to come very very soon i won't be worthy to undo the
straps of his sandals he will be the messiah he'll be he'll be you know effectively he'll be god
and then jesus turns up and he goes oh there he is over there this guy he's gone right completely
different in mark when you go and have a look at what says in mark jesus and john don't talk to each
other in that that's what happens is john is saying the messiah is coming soon john is an
apocalyptic preacher too by the way john is saying the messiah is coming soon the apocalypse is coming
soon you know the axe is laying at the root of the tree like the we're going to start shopping
and once the trees chop down everything's going to get burned so he's preaching this apocalyptic
message and then he's baptising people to to prepare them for the coming apocalypse and jesus
gets baptised now it doesn't say at any point that john says anything to jesus gone john doesn't
point to jesus go here's that bloke i was just talking about you know here's that messiah remember
here he is doesn't say a word jesus gets baptised and he jesus sees the spirit of god
descending on him like a dove and he and jesus hears a voice saying you are my only my only son
with whom i'm all well pleased no one else does and then he goes off into the desert to meditate
and have a bit of a chat to satan it's a completely different story and in the the gospel of mark what
seems to be happening is that seems to be the point where jesus becomes the messiah he then
goes off and has a bit of an argument with satan satan tries to test him he passes the test
then john gets arrested and that's when jesus decides to take up the mantle of john
and become the apocalyptic preacher and that's when he comes out with that message in mark 115
repent and believe because the kingdom of god is near at hand so it's a totally different story
so and then the other thing that's quite interesting is
remember i was saying that it was a cosmic battle and they they conceived of the earth as being very
much ruled by satan and god was going to reassert his authority and impose his kingship over the
entire world that meant that demons were pretty much in control of what was going on on earth and
this is why particularly in the snoptics especially in mark you get all these demon stories there's
all these stories of jesus driving out demons now a lot of modern christians kind of skip over those
because you know it's a bit weird you know what yeah demons okay it's a little bit like the exorcist
it's a bit weird fundamentalist christians kind of like that because they believe in demons and
possession but um there's lots of stories in in the in the snoptics particularly mark about
jesus driving out demons and exorcism a lot of the healing that jesus does is actually to do with
exorcism because people believe that demonic possession well causes cause disease they also
believe that sin caused disease so forgiving sin that that that drives away the disease
driving out the demon that drives away the disease this idea of sin causing disease was
common at the time as well and the idea of demonic possession was common at the time
so what jesus is doing or being depicted as doing in driving out these demons is is showing or
prefiguring the power of the kingdom of god and at one point john the baptist who's in prison
in mark's gospel sends messages to jesus saying who are you are you are you the guy that we've
been expecting or is it what we expect from someone else keep him on this is john the baptist
is meant to be apparently jesus's cousin he seems to have forgotten that you know but anyway so
john the baptist doesn't yeah john the baptist doesn't know who jesus is so he says these guys
to jesus and says what's going on who are you and jesus i'm driving out demons i'm healing the
the lame i'm healing the blind this is this has been prophesied as being the signs that the kingdom
is coming and he's actually referring to two passages in isiah about you know the blind will
eyes of the blind will be opened the ears of the death will be unstopped the lame will leap like
dear the tongue of the speeches will sing let's sing for joy so he's talking about releasing
people from the captivity of demonic domination and oppression and he says in the response to to
john the baptist he says go tell john what you have seen and heard the blind received their sight
the lame walk the lepers are cleansed the death here the dead arrays the poor that's them again
have good news bought to them so again what he's saying is here are the signs that the
apocalypse is coming and in this passage he's probably being depicted as saying that yeah i am
the messiah as well though in in mark he kind of plays plays that down so again it's hard to say
whether or not the historical jesus was was actually saying that but definitely what what is going on
in these gospel depictions of him as an exorcist and a healer is they're not saying he's god
no because they don't make that point what they're saying is here he is probably the messiah
manifesting the power that we're going to see when the apocalypse comes and when the kingdom comes
because he's dry he's he's breaking the domination of the of the demonic powers
he's he's healing people as a as a prefigurement of the of the power of god that's going to be
imposed on the renewed earth after the apocalypse it all fits with this whole message the whole
thing is completely consistent so a few things um that i'd like to comment on to kind of give
our audience something to go with what you're pointing out in this episode so far is clear
elements that are in the air that aren't beyond the reason of any common sense to say a person is
saying this someone's saying this it's common it's well known one can try and argue and go well
they just used the quotes from these books and put them in the gospels but it which what fits best
here in this particular scenario you're saying a man a preacher who's obviously teaching a tradition
that the end is near the kingdom of god is at hand it's very apocalyptic anyone who reads this stuff
knows or should know at least even christians do they just apply it to themselves today even though
they've missed 2000 years um they're a little a little bit late to the party but um i want to
ask you since you mentioned john the baptist and i think this is good in the historical
jesus angle in the vein um we know that he's mentioned by josephus we know that john the
baptist is claimed to be a cousin of jesus he's claimed to be family uh we know that there's claims
in the gospels jesus had other brothers um and we know that what the mythicist will say and this
isn't a mythicist show this is a show to like showing the historical jesus using the apocalyptic
angle um what do we do with paul since he doesn't really reference or at least he doesn't quote
jesus often at all some there are some disputed passages as some say this is clear indication
like the night he was handed over or some of these passages that seem to be like
is that referring to gospels is it not um what do we do with that and the apocalyptic jesus
what's paul in your opinion doing here with that guy you know like what do you think he's doing
okay so so the the the argument is often made um and it's often over stated that paul never talks
about jesus as a historical earthly um recent guy and that's not true there are there are there are
a number of references in paul's letters that are pretty clearly about jesus as a human being and yeah
i know mythicists have um counter against all of them some of which are kind of like yeah maybe
others are just completely stupid so when when paul says that jesus was born of a woman they had
this convoluted thing where they say oh that was allegorical but we have multiple and i mean dozens
of uses of that phrase in greek uh but particularly in aramaic and hebrew and born of a woman means
a human being so what paul is doing there is he's he's he's emphasizing jesus as human aspect
right but but he's saying the born of a woman and born under the laws
was that's what he's saying but paul is his main born of a woman born under the law sorry
but he says that he was born of a woman and born under the law so that means he was born a human
and born a jew so he's born a jewish man in that passage he's emphasizing jesus as jewish
and human elements but paul believed that jesus was obviously was more than just a jewish man
he believed that after his death he was raised by god he didn't rise himself
paul never uses that language he was raised by god and exalted to the to the the highest
second only to god not god but second only to god as as the messiah paul believed that jesus
became the messiah effectively after the resurrection he has a very different sort of
christology to to say the gospel writers so what paul is saying is well there was this guy
who had a there was this being who had a pre uh human existence in heaven this was a common idea
about the messiah so this is not unique to paul um and it probably an angelic style being who
in obedience to god humbled himself became a human being was this guy on earth got crucified
got raised by god and then was exalted to the to the status of messiah paul is much more interested
in the post resurrection jesus right so his theology is much more focused on that and this
is something that mythicists use and sort of say well he's mainly talking about jesus as this sort
of celestial being yeah because he's mainly talking about jesus after the resurrection
but he does make references to jesus being a descendant of king david in romans one three
and a descendant of abraham and a descendant of jesse so you can't be a descendant of all these
humans and not be a human right now again mythicist you know richie carrier famously uses his
cosmic sperm bank theory which is probably the dumbest mythicist argument ever invented but
you know he has to he has to find a way to take a reference to jesus being a descendant of david
and and and make it fit the the idea that jesus wasn't human at all so he's paul talking about
occasionally talking about jesus as a human but he's mainly focused on jesus after and and what
he's saying is that jesus is going to come um you know in in a perusia he's going he's going to come
in in a like a ceremonial royal arrival that's what the word of perusia means and and that's
going to happen when the apocalypse comes so he was raised um to this exalted height after the
resurrection when the apocalypse comes he will be the messiah he will be the son of man figure that's
coming with the armies of angels paul definitely believed in the coming apocalypse he definitely
he refers to it and he talks about it but it happening soon he makes references to to the
fact that you know his generation probably will see it uh if not his generation then the generation
after was he says that in the thessalonians so he he fits completely in with the idea of of the
coming apocalypse he what he's done is he sort of slotted jesus into that in a in a fairly
individualistic way because he's having to account for the fact that jesus was crucified
then what we find is is the gospel sort of taking up that theme um because that that then
developed over the over the intervening decades what we then find though is a problem because the
apocalypse doesn't come so remember all those passages i was talking about before and there's
about six or seven of them saying it'll happen in our lifetimes and this is jesus saying that
so what do you do if people stand it wants us to die and and the apocalypse still hasn't happened
well you you reframe it and we find this with what we call millenarian sex today so there are
all these apocalyptic cults some of them christian some of them not who are saying you know the great
prophet says that the apocalypse is going to come at five o'clock on june 23rd june 23rd
comes around as well maybe it'll be six o'clock maybe it's june 23rd next year they keep pushing
it back and we see evidence of that in the um in the gospels as well we start to see it in the
gospel of luke so he starts to temper some of these uh these sayings about it'll happen in your
lifetime and we start to see particularly in luke and we see it in the gospel of thomas as well
that oh well the kingdom is kind of within you so they're starting to find a way they're starting
to to think about the kingdom as being something more internal and spiritual rather than um apocalyptic
and actual then we get to john and john pretty much the apocalypse all goes completely out the
window there's very very little in john there's a couple of residual references to the kingship of god
but on the whole the message isn't this apocalypse is coming soon it's i have come it's me i'm the i'm
the thing that has been prophesied and by the way i'm pretty much god you know before the father was
i am uh you know there's a couple of bits in john that indicate that they're still seeing him as a
bit below god no one knows it not even not even the son only the father knows so there's there's
still some elements of that earlier idea of jesus is lower than god but on the whole john
jettison's the whole apocalypse thing and then christianity pretty much goes down the path of john
there's always movements that go back and look at this apocalyptic stuff and say ah yeah okay yeah
we take that literally and of course you got the book of revelation which only just made it into the
bible canon back in the third third century but it's all about the apocalypse but what's happened
what happens over the centuries is that's all about well that's going to be in the future
sometime and they always go back to the no one knows the day or the hour passages to say well
you can't say it's going to happen at nine o'clock on june 23rd right even though christians keep trying
to um so your mainstream church is always like yeah of course that'll happen eventually eventually
because now we're 2000 years down the track and it still hasn't bloody happened right so this is
what happened was as christianity drifted from its jewish roots it became less and less apocalyptic
as as more and more non-jews became christians we know that was starting with with paul way back
in like the 40 30s 40s 50s ad as that happened then then christianity sort of became less and less
connected to this ancient jewish apocalyptic or this jewish apocalyptic tradition that have been
its initial um mainstay and then what happens is you get the the jewish war 66 to 70 ad the
Jerusalem gets sacked the temple gets destroyed and judaism kind of fragments and as a result
the the jewish connection between christian or the connection between christianity and judaism gets
weakened even more and so christianity ceases to be eventually ceases to be a jewish sect
and becomes increasingly a greco- roman savior cult with and that's where that's where the john
thing really sort of kicks in jesus as the savior becomes the focus not becoming apocalypse and
then people find ways to kind of play down the apocalyptic stuff that's in the early gospels
which is why i have to really have to work hard to get people to ignore john and pay attention to
mark because when you look at that early stuff you can see where it all came from and what you
see is that evolution you see in mark the apocalyptic stuff is very very strong it's still quite
strong in matthew it's weakening in in luke it's uh but and it becomes a very very weak by the time
you get to john so we see this evolution i think this is interesting it's it's a thought experiment
on me and maybe this is irrelevant to them having a jewish uh angelic or divine being if you will
always there with god kind of like the wisdom um there's uh margaret barker talks about wisdom
and some interesting ideas that play a role in the jewish mind but even when i was a christian
i used to think to myself before i was born i probably was in heaven with god and i went to
the throne and he said all right this is your life now you have to go fulfill your destiny
and he sends me into this world and i forgot that at one point i was actually up there with him
and he sent me and then one day i'll go back to him and go see remember this conversation i told
you you know like and that was like in my head but i think it's interesting to see um was that a
common thought or you're not sure if that was a common thought among like people to think of
themselves or was that like specifically thought of of that um the messiah would come like that was
attached to a messianic concept okay it's it's hard to make generalizations about what people
then thought because there was no there wasn't a single Judaism there were lots of traditions and
also we've only got fragments of of documents reflecting some of them so you can't say you
can't say for example that everyone was expecting a messiah uh so the idea that everyone was expecting
a messiah is is is kind of this common sunday school thing that all christians get taught
and and that they were expecting a military messiah you know they're expecting like a
a guy who's going to rise up against the romans there are all kinds of expectations about the
messiah um there were expectations that we're going to be more than one messiah there's going to be a
a prophetic messiah who is elijah returned there's going to be a kingly messiah and there was going
to be a priestly messiah and you actually see jesus being depicted as embodying both the kingly
and the priestly messiah with the um the prophetic messiah um role being being given to john the
baptist but was it a common idea the idea that the messiah had a heavenly pre-existence certainly
was quite seems to have been reasonably common and so when paul is talking in in um uh in philippines
philippines too about you know how how jesus seeing equality with god not as something to be to be
seized but humbled himself and took on the form of a servant in other words became a became a human
being um that he's reflecting that um the idea that certain things had a heavenly pre-existence
was very common in in judeism so the idea that the temple had always existed in heaven
was quite was was quite widespread and you find that in uh in the book of revelations where there's a
there's a renewed temple that the heavenly temple effectively comes to earth uh the idea that the
Torah uh the the the jewish scriptures had always existed in heaven also developed in in the period
after the the destruction of the temple and the rabbinical period there was this idea that
there was an eternal Torah and the Torah on earth is it's is it's earthly reflection this idea that
that there were celestial things and they had reflections on earth is actually something they
found this way into judeism from greek philosophy this is a platonic idea the idea that there is a
perfect um spiritual realm and the earth is it's the earthly manifestations are it's imperfect
reflections which went on to to develop in the christian tradition in the traditions that
sometimes get referred to as narcissism um so so yeah the idea that jesus would have had a
heavenly pre-existence that's pretty clear in um paul stuff whether the gospel writers thought that
is not clear um there's one there's one bit about i saw satan fall from heaven that's in luke
so it could be that that's luke reflecting luke the writer of luke reflecting the idea that jesus
was in heaven before he came to earth um but but there's no sign of it in mark and i can't find any
sign of it in in matthew it's certainly clear in john you know it just starts in the beginning was
the word and the word was with god and the word was a god by the way is the best translation of
um so so yeah this idea that that jesus would have had some kind of heavenly pre-existence
is is quite clear and again mythosus kind of sees on that because they sort of say well see
he never came to earth he's always in the heavens the whole idea behind that principle though was that
there was an earthly manifestation and there is no indication anywhere despite what mythosus
tried to claim of anyone thinking that the messiah would not come to earth or would not manifest on
earth so that there's there's no indication anywhere of anyone thinking that the messiah
was not going to manifest on earth the whole idea was that he was going to be the descendant of king
david or or at least a prophet uh style figure and or a priestly style figure but your whole point
was that he was going to be on earth um so all these mythosus attempts to try and use things like
the ascension of Isaiah and and a couple of other fragments to to argue that oh the idea there was
an idea that he was only going to descend to the lower heavens there's no evidence for that
if i may if i may um you know because i'm friends with everybody i have no derogatory
stance at all like there's no animosity or anything but um i do think that dr carers trying to fix
that problem when he says stuff like oh he did take on flesh and he did this and he did that
but i oh and look and i'm not trying to give you points here okay i'm trying to be as nice as i
can because i'm truly fair here i really am i'm i'm telling you my i try everyone's bias but i'm
trying not to be and i really am fairly assessing this i still couldn't i can't wrap my head around
how that makes sense and one of the problems that i had is i asked dr price you know if there's a
man that i know is a great guy and that i absolutely adore dr price is one of them like he's one of my
best friends okay but i had these questions and i still ask him and i go dr price i have to ask
you we've done like two or three videos on the same thing because it just for me it hasn't sunk in
there's not like this when you make an argument you gotta you gotta explain it to me like it's
like a six-year-old okay and if i don't get it um i'm still asking the question and i said
what for one example the crucifixion all right what did that mean because in my mind when i hear
jesus got crucified by the archons right which are usually the demonic powers and paul according
to mythicists i cannot help but think of a wooden stake right i keep thinking of a wooden cross or
a wooden pole or a tree or something real literal tangible in real reality and one of the quick
leaps that i've heard from people who aren't necessarily the top dogs and mythicism will go
odin hung on a tree right or they'll use like these other gods that were on trees and things
right which i'm trying to use outcomes razor and within the uh verisimilitude okay and also within
the context of a jewish type of thing to try and understand first before i go anywhere else
and i said well when i hear crucifixion i think well there were real jews that were really being
crucified during this time that seems most plausible explanation to me what does it mean
to mythicist and he goes well there's various opinions on this and he's right one of them is
a celestial understanding of like uh i know acharya s at one point said that there is a
celestial sign of the cross and that somehow uh the the venus may have passed across who knows the
the bright morning star gets crucified right to me i have a hard time though accepting that that
whole thing it's like i don't know why i think it's because it just to me the most common sense
application is that the gospels and i know that that you have to divorce paul from the gospels
i understand that i have a very hard time not seeing that connection though i it's like i understand
like the gospels do things to go beyond paul they're using paul too by the way it's like you
know but they go beyond him and some of them spit in paul's face i think matthew is when he says
workers of lawlessness that's just my guess but anyway i'm just throwing ideas out there to say
i have a hard time understanding a celestial or heavenly crucifixion without it being one that
that really took place here i understand there's as above so below a reflection but what is that
reflection below i mean we could say it happened in the heavens as well sure there may have been
demonic powers in the heavens they may have believed there was something going on as a reflection
of what was happening down here but was it happening down here and that's i'm trying to wrestle as
you can see in my own head here okay i i think you're being very fair um but this is definitely
a weak one of a number of weak points in the mythos argument because because however you cut it
the idea of the messiah being crucified or being killed just doesn't fit with the expectations
now carrier and others try to to scratch around and find what they think are references to earlier
than christianity to an idea of a dying and rising messiah no one is outside of the mythos
bubble is is convinced by that stuff so there's there's very very there's very very little there
to work with on the whole it seems like that actually the crucifixion of jesus was was one
of the major problems that christianity had to overcome paul himself says we preach christ
crucified which is a an absurdity to the gentiles a scandal there's a scandal on this the word he
actually uses in the greek and and a a stumbling block to the jews so if the idea that the messiah
was going to be was going to die uh or was going to certainly was going to be crucified
why would that would a crucified messiah be a stumbling block to the jews i mean absurdity
to the gentiles i kind of get a scandal to the gentiles but why a stumbling block to the jews
surely if that was part of the expectation then the jews would say okay well that that particular
strain of messianic prophecy turns out to be true what is going on in in both the gospels and
certainly in um in in paul is they're trying to explain and they're working pretty hard to explain
how jesus could be the messiah and also be crucified and paul sort of says oh yeah it's
a complete paradox isn't it so so much of a paradox it must be true um and in the gospels
we're constantly getting all these these uh these references to bits of the old testament they have
never previously been interpreted as being the messiah is going to die the messiah is going to
get nailed to a cross so if you look at the the so-called passion narratives the narratives of
jesus's arrest and crucifixion they're a tapestry of references to the old testament uh and
mythos to say well that's because they're making the whole thing up out of out of whole cloth they're
making it up out of the old testament but he doesn't fit those old testament prophecies very
well at all so there's there's the the sufferings um servant stuff in aziah that they're using to say
well here's about here's this stuff that's about how the messiah was going to be was going to be
crucified no one recognized it until jesus came along but now we recognize it the problem is if
you look at the suffering servant passages in aziah the the servant goes on to to live a long life
and to look upon his children and his descendants well jesus didn't live a long life he was crucified
pretty young and he certainly didn't look upon children and descendants so the suffering servant
passages don't actually fit unless you just sort of take a few bits of them which is what christianity
has done what they seem to be doing is they're trying really really hard to make a crucified jesus
fit the messiah barriers and they're actually working extremely hard finding bits and pieces in
the old testament the jewish scriptures that had never been interpreted that way before this is a
major problem for mythicism because if jesus is is is someone who evolves out of the idea of a
celestial jesus who was crucified and this was all part of jewish expectation we should find an
series of earlier traditions using the aziah passages and the passages from the psalms
to predict a messiah who is going to be who's going to die and going to be crucified we don't
find that so it makes much more sense that a apocalyptic preacher went to jerusalem
ran afoul of the local authorities because he was there a Passover when when the romans were in
town pilot came to jerusalem for festivals he didn't live there he came up from cesarea
to keep a lid on people like jesus got arrested got crucified crucifixion is a roman execution
got crucified and that left his followers saying well hang on how's this meant to work he's the
apocalypse is meant to come he's we think he's probably the messiah now he's dead how does that
work and what we know about apocalyptic cults is that what they don't do when when the apocalypse
doesn't happen is go oh we were wrong let's go home there's a classic study from the 1950s called
when prophecy fails which is a which is a sociological psychological study of this phenomenon
what they do is they reframe it they find a way to make that the the disaster into a triumph and
this seems to be what the the early jesus sect did he's dead how does that make sense let's go back
to the scriptures and look ah here's something about someone being pierced in in a psalm here's
something about here's something about a servant who suffers and gets reviled but then is vindicated
this was meant to happen so what's going on he's died he's gone onto heaven he's risen
that's what's happened it's a prefigurement of the resurrection so in some sense he's risen
he's coming back in a perusia in a in a in a royal procession with the angels in the apocalypse
it's all okay we find this in paul and we find this in the in in all of the gospels where they're
saying oh he's coming back very very soon this is what's going on it makes far more sense that
they're trying to make to make sense of a messiah who unexpectedly you know suppose messiah who
unexpectedly got crucified and christianity was actually very sensitive about crucifix their
crucifixion of jesus for a long long time they never depicted jesus on the cross until into the
third into the fourth century constant time banned crucifixion as a form of execution and it began
to lose its its associations with escape slaves it was it was the way you executed escape slaves
and brigands and rebels so it began to lose that those social and political associations
that they started actually depicting jesus on the cross before that they never did the first
depiction that we have of jesus on a cross is from a graffiti in rome that that depicts
jesus with the head of a donkey and a guy it's a very very crude scratched and plaster on a wall
and with a guy in front of him worshiping him with an inscription in greek underneath saying
alexa menos worships his god this is a pagan mocking christianity and what does he pick he picks
crucifix the crucifixion of jesus he picks jesus with a donkey's head so this is where it gets
back to what i was saying before about paul saying we preach a crucified christ a stumbling
block to the jew so not in fitting in keeping with the jewish traditions about the messiah
and a scandal an absurdity to the pagans and this is what this is what this this graffiti shows
a crucifix jesus does not fit the expectations at all christianity is working extremely hard
to make it fit with the idea that he was a messiah that tells us i would argue and most scholars
would argue that tells us that what they're doing is they're having to shoehorn an actual
historical event that was extremely awkward you asked before about john the baptist and how
john the baptist fits in okay so let's think about the sunday school evangelical bible class
version of john the baptist that's you know john the baptist preached that jesus was coming
then jesus came he said he's jesus and and he was jesus's cousin and they were friends and and then
john the baptist got executed right that's sort of the story that's not the story that we find in
in the gospels it's it's sort of like the story we find in john and then we find other versions of it
the interesting thing about the john the baptist baptizing jesus story is that we find it in every
single one of the gospels it's one of the few elements that is in all of the gospels we find it
in mark and i took before about how we mark um it's not like the john version so there's no
interaction between jesus and john john doesn't acknowledge jesus at all and later in the gospel
he seems messages to say to jesus who the hell are you right right so so it's nothing like the
gospel of john's version where he's proclaiming here he is um that doesn't fit very well uh with the
with the story as it evolves because remember i said in mark it seems to be that jesus for mark
becomes the messiah at that point but for matthew and luke um jesus has been the messiah since birth
remember they're the only two gospels that tell the story of jesus's birth they just tell
two completely different stories but one of the the the common elements is that jesus was proclaimed
by angels to to be the messiah from birth so that poses a problem when they uh because they're using
mark as their source when when matthew gets to that story in mark he's struck by the fact that
they don't talk so he puts a bit of dialogue in so he has as uh john's saying to jesus i shouldn't
be baptizing you you should be baptizing me and jesus says no no no this is how it's meant to be
that's not found in mark so he inserts that to try and make the story fit it's a bit awkward though
it still doesn't make a lot of sense that because baptism is is a superior forgiving and inferior
it still doesn't make a whole lot of sense what luke does is a bit more subtle luke luke was a
bit more of a clever writer than matthew matthew was not very clever writer um what luke does is he
inserts a story much much earlier where jesus and uh and john are relatives and so jesus's mother
mary goes and visits john john's mother elizabeth right and john in the womb leaps in the womb and
mary and elizabeth says to mary you know my son just you know my baby just left in the womb and
that's um john in the womb acknowledging jesus as his superior so then when when he tells the story
of the baptism it's okay he's kind of gone around that problem how does john deal with it he deals
with it by by removing the problem completely and having john saying here's the messiah because he
he's he's much further removed from the from the whole tradition but what's going on here
that story is told by every single gospel what seems to be happening again is they're shoehorning
something historical into the story and then changing it as as their ideas about um jesus
evolve so it seems that the baptism by john is probably one of the things that we can say
happened it seems to have been something that was very significant to jesus because it's strong in
the tradition but what they're doing is the tradition about who jesus was changes is they're
changing the story which it indicates to me that that they're having to deal again with an awkward
element jesus being baptized by what i supposed inferior and they're having to find a way to
fit it in life the crucifixion it makes most sense this is really an interesting thought
experiment i think is important for anybody who's investigating these things i really enjoy that
i mean you've got jesus being born and uh both of the birth narratives here he is you know having
it since birth and mark he gets it at baptism and john he had it since before the creation of the
world yeah and uh i love that it shows a development a growth and we know that we date these books
like this too i mean it's like the consensus to be dating these things so tim i'm fairly certain
we could even do more episodes touching on other elements i recently interviewed ian mills he is
a christian um but he is a duke university phd student like he's no joke and i had to ask him
in person when we interviewed he's dude i'm telling you he's such an awesome guy like to
hang out and talk with him i said he told me his version of the apocalyptic jesus right off the cuff
giving me examples and i was like and you're a christian and he's like yes and i'm like how are
you a christian you know like i don't understand that i didn't understand it look i i know one thing
i haven't actually spoken with him but i've interacted with him on twitter and you know there's
because he's a christian and i'm an atheist i suppose there's a little bit of work in this
but you know he knows his stuff there's no there's no doubt about that it's interesting that some of
the the leading proponents of jesus as an apocalyptic prophet are christians now exactly
how they they do the mental gymnastics whereby they accept that jesus was basically a jewish
preacher who preached their coming apocalypse that didn't happen and then died and was wrong
and and to maintain their christianity you'd have to ask ian um probably one of the best books
on this topic and we'll put a link uh in the in the in the show but is by dael c allison whose
book is jesus of nazareth millenarium prophet allison is a christian but this book is it's
pretty dense and it's pretty scholarly but this book is probably i'd say the best summation of
why we can conclude that jesus was an apocalyptic prophet probably a little bit more accessible
is our old friend bart ermann's book see if i can get that to actually show up on screen
yeah um there we go uh which is uh jesus apocalyptic prophet of the new millenium that's
probably the best introduction to this topic it's very accessible like all of bart's books
and he also does a really good job of explaining how do we how do we use the gospels um not
taking them at face value but use them to to extrapolate from like where did this stuff come
from and a lot of myths just happen you know dislike we talked about this earlier dislike
the fact that i refer to the gospels and use it as evidence may as go it's all nonsense well
sure you know obviously i don't accept that the gospels are real um that were true or can be taken
at face value but if we're going to examine how this the stories they tell arose we have to start
with them and then work our way backwards and that's what that's what bart ermann does in that
book and tells you how he's he's working and how he's doing it probably the third book this one's
pretty good story but how did we arrive at the conclusion about jesus and apocalyptic prophet
that's um yeah that's albert schwarz's schwarz's book uh the quest for the historical jesus which
was written a hundred years ago but basically traces how we scholarship got from jesus's lord to
maybe you might have just been a cheery guy um now look there are there are non christian scholars
who don't accept the apocalyptic jesus hypothesis i just don't think they've got a very good case
the main group of them tend to be um tend to be kind of the ones who like the idea of jesus as a
as a kind of a political social activist who believed in social justice and and was preaching a
message of of equality and egalitarianism and and economic change my problem with those guys is
they have to work really really hard to to try and find a way to get the apocalyptic stuff that's
in the early stuff to have that as a later addition even though it's in the earliest traditions
it really doesn't work and ermann tackles this in his book but the the other problem with that
with them is they're guys who are kind of they may only kind of like west coast californian
academics who are into social justice and economic change and and their jesus just happens to be
kind of politically liberal and intersocial justice and economic change this is something
that that uh sprites uh commented on a hundred years ago it's funny how a lot of people who go
looking for a historical jesus come up with one who looks just like them catholic theologians go
looking for a historical jesus and come up with one who founds a hierarchy and and establishes
sacraments you know so as effectively a catholic priest how strange Protestants go looking for a
jesus who's an evangelical preacher and baptiser how strange social justice warriors go looking for
apocalyptic jesus is a social justice warrior one of the things that i think makes it more likely
that the apocalyptic jesus is true is that uh he doesn't fit that mold i'd say he doesn't confirm
anyone's biases this is why when people say well you accept jesus do you like a christian really
the excuse is i accept was a dirty peasant dude who believed that angels were going to come down
from the heavens and fight the romans and then the world was going to turn into a magic disneyland
and was wrong and and as a result was killed in a horrible way and didn't rise from the dead
and was was just an idiot who i mean he might have been a nice guy but he was a fucking idiot who
was wrong i'm not a christian maybe we should end on that note terry him thank you so much man i
really do appreciate that guys if you're interested go check him out historyforatheist.com he has a lot
on history he deals with mythicist arguments he responds to comments uh not always needing to in
my opinion you should probably not even respond to some things but the worst comes out of you
sometimes when you do i guess uh people have noticed i was being a bit naughty on some of those
yeah fair enough terry but i um i have a lot of respect for what you're bringing to the table
you've been absolutely kind to me i mean you thought i was a mythicist when you first got on
did or didn't know you know whether or not i was or not you were just like oh well i might be dealing
with a mythicist especially when my channel is predominantly interviewed mythicist um and various
other theories that would be considered outside of the mainstream and i continue to do so i i
think that having a voice there to have also a response to those things are valuable i think
it's very important to have that instead of just tossing it to the side because they will continue
to grow and the idea will continue to grow without having a critical response or ideas even debate
like i have coming up soon so i want to give everybody a little heads up on something that's
coming that's important first off go in the description help my boy tim out go check it out
subscribe to the channel or to his website so he can get you updates on anything that he publishes
and go check out his work because we're going to be doing more shows on the history of the burning
of alexandria and various other historical uh how should i say it uh mistakes that people maybe
have made i'd like to have you guys join me in those and show us some support you may not like
tim's responses sometimes but myth vision podcast is about entertaining and teaching you guys some
things you may not have ever heard um i have upcoming debate between dr mark goodacre and
dr denis r mcdonald that are going to be on to q or not to q on the question of q and did the q
gospel the lost gospel actually exist and if you have known and seen my dr goodacre show you know
what he says no we don't need one he's not saying there couldn't be he just doesn't find it to be
the best argument in his proposition whereas denis r mcdonald says nope uh i agree with most of what
mark says if not 99 percent of it i agree with he says the problem is you still need q and he
tells why so be on look out for that debate and another debate coming up with dr richard carrier
mythicist against dr denis r mcdonald and the whole topic is about similar things that were
discussed today here on was jesus just a guy an apocalyptic preacher who was mythologized or
was he you hemorrhized um later on to becoming a man when he was really angelic or celestial or
divine and then becomes man over time which one makes the most sense so this debate will be an
interesting one bringing it here at myth vision podcast um i just want to give you guys some heads
up like tim is like tim is um laying the palm leaves down on the ground at the entrance of
jerusalem right now somebody's getting crucified though just in case you're wondering i'm just
kidding tim thank you so much man do you have anything you'd like to say to everybody uh before
we go uh no look look i do like to respond to people's comments and look if you're gonna call
me a poopy head and and you know attack me or whatever yeah look i may i may not take you
terribly seriously but on the whole i like to respond in detail to anyone who's actually
makes an argument if you just repeat stuff that i've already kind of counted in this video then
you try not to do that that doesn't really help us listen to what i've said and respond and i'll
and i'll and be civil and polite and i'll be civil and polite to you even if we if we disagree
tell me that on the biggest douche in the universe um probably won't be that polite to you
oddly enough uh the other thing i would say is that i've got an article on my blog called Jesus
the Apocalyptic Prophet which is pretty much a uh a more detailed version of what i've been talking
about today in which quotes multiple multiple texts that show that this this uh the apocalyptic
stuff in the gospels was around at the time and that Jesus seems to have been one of those guys
so check that out and i'd encourage you before you comment on the video to actually read that
article that might help as well ladies and gentlemen you heard it from tim onil thank you
for joining me on myth vision podcast and you guys go down in the description you can help us out
check out myth vision podcast dot com you guys become a patreon get early access to all my videos
i put them on patreon early so you guys can check them out 99 of those videos are videos asking the
scholar early questions like dr price from you you wanted to ask a question so i went to his house
i asked your question and here it is um mp4 uh high definition 1080p so you guys consider joining
becoming a patreon to help me out and grow this channel so i can keep doing these endeavors and
grow the channel eventually i'd like to travel all over the world but especially the united states
and talk to some of these scholars and get this information out there to the public where you
don't have to go to a seminary or go to a college to try and find out or have to go read a massive
book you can watch it in a video so before you forget i hope you don't we are myth vision
