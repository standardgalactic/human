We are live myth-fishing podcast usually I do these lives and and I've just been
getting straight into it and we have a confession to make but first don't
if you have the guts to play for blood I'm your huckleberry just market
all right ladies and gentlemen dr. Dennis R. McDonald is in the house and you
know what we thought we need to talk it's time that he admits what he has
come to as a conclusion pertaining to the four gospels in the New Testament he
has confided in me and it took some took some hard work but we finally came to a
conclusion that he thinks everything discussed written in all four gospels of
the New Testament happened as exactly the way that they are described and they
are all historical to a tee and so you know this is our confession and
apology am I did I get that right no you did not get that oh I got that wrong
I'm sorry um he doesn't think that these gospels are reliable and accurate to a
tee it's a guessing game if anything I'm wondering what actually happened how did
I get that mixed up well because you thought that I appreciated the gospels
and therefore when you appreciate something you think it's telling always
the truth I'm interested in the gospels I think they're beautiful but they're
telling different stories and they're not to be homogenized they're to be
understood for their own sake and the gospels are in a discussion with each
other and their richness is in the diversity of the witness of the gospels
not in their mind that they're homogenous yeah and so yes I do appreciate the
gospels but I appreciate them for their diversity not because they're all telling
the same story truly so if I said because of that you're probably going to hell
that doesn't scare you so I wanted to have my friend Dennis McDonald who's
here in the flesh um he's actually in the flesh this is this is in the phantom
and I wanted to discuss his upcoming book that he's doing we wanted to have a
hangout with you if you have questions shoot them our way and Dennis will try
and chip away at him we're given 90 minutes away and then wow our schedule
was pretty pretty slammed and so you have two books coming one I do and I want
to introduce them both but I want to start with my favorite book is the
synopses of the epic tragedy in the gospels which came out two years ago
it's 570 pages it's a bargain it's for $30 available on Amazon and the reason I
want to start with that is the the sequel which is called must the
synoptics remain a problem is an answer to people but many of whom were a part
of the myth revision chats who were questioning the existence of the Q
document now there are two major contributions that I've made in I think
in the synopses and I'm not going to talk about the contributions to
understanding the Gospel of John or the Acts of the Apostles so much but about
the synoptic gospels themselves one of the contributions is that I integrate my
reconstruction of the so-called Q document along with other gospels in
parallel columns set up in chronological order so that one can read from the
beginning of this an optic tradition across the page to Luke to get a sense
of the development of the gospel tradition but many people have been
skeptical about Q and in a and in a documentary that Derek and I have put
together the metaphor that I use in the title is why is Q in intensive care
because I think the Q document the the people who tried to reconstruct it made
two terrible mistakes right at the beginning and it continues to be a
problem for acceptance of the Q hypothesis and I'll talk about what they
are in just a moment so this book must the synoptics remain a problem is an
answer actually to you who listened to myth vision we've made a huge just
making sure I'm correct here myth vision has been such an impact on you and
inspiring to you in terms of how you want to engage with the public right
indeed absolutely that's good to hear and because I got feedback about my work
there were so many people who said well we don't have a fragment of Q and
therefore it didn't exist well I'm primarily a textual critic and I've
reconstructed other documents from antiquity mostly Christian apocryphal
texts and classicists are reconstructing lost documents all the time and to say
that you don't have a physical manuscript let's say of a platonic
letter doesn't mean that we don't have evidence that there was such a thing and
that we can reconstruct it so there's a simple minded negativity about Q that
is unfortunate but there are also scholarly reasons for rejecting the
traditional Q reconstruction and these have been highlighted by
people like Mark Goodacre and others who hold to the far hypothesis and one of
the great complaints of the traditional Q hypothesis and its reconstruction in
places like the critical edition of Q is the commitment that Luke does not know
Matthew so places where we find agreements between Matthew and Luke
against Mark mean that you can do oscillating priority between Matthew and
Luke with certain criteria and reconstruct the lost gospel related to
that is the commitment of the international Q project that Mark
does not know the Q document so then you go in through the gospels combing out
everything that you can find that has a mark and influence and so if you get
rid of that then maybe you have a better chance of identifying the Q document but
we know that the evidence is really quite compelling that Mark knows Q and if
so it's the earliest witness that we have to the Q document and in my view it's
really the most fascinating and so that if you get rid of Q as a witness to the
lost gospel you're really you mean Mark as a witness Mark as a witness yes I'm
sorry mark as the witness to the Q document you're creating another
problem so the reason that the Q document is in intensive care is that you
have two ailments that need treatment one is Luke's alleged methane intolerance
that is Luke doesn't know Matthew Luke knows Matthew and so we have to figure
out the factor that in the second is cues I'm sorry marks no cues mark and
amnesia that is the reconstruction of Q tries to get rid of mark and influence
when in fact mark is an important witness to the Q document now the solution
of these is a simple treatment called reversed priority that is you have Matthew
Luke overlaps Luke knows Matthew but why is it that more often than not Luke has
a more primitive version than he finds in Matthew so that the wording or the
sequencing of a saying is more primitive in Luke than it is in Matthew even
the same thing is true of Mark Matthew in Mark Matthew was later than Mark but
Matthew often has more primitive sayings than you'd find in in Mark now how can
that be if Matthew is redacting Mark now these are very complex questions and
they are best answered in Greek I think they're best answered in parallel columns
and with certain criteria that one uses to tease out what is the most likely
primitive version you have to use social site social identity theory to
determine the cohesiveness of these materials do they come out of the same
stratum of memory of the early church can what do you do about sequencing how
do you know that the that Matthew or Luke is more faithful to the order than
not and making it even more exciting is that Mark has Homeric imitations you
incorporate your mimesis into this so mimesis is a very important part of
this project because Mark is involved in a what I call a mimetic hybridity he
is rewriting the lost gospel mark but he also is imitating the Homeric epics you
know lost gospel mark but just the lost gospel sorry I know what you mean now
well let me say it again okay mark is creating a mimetic hybrid on the one
hand he's rewriting the lost gospel but we're calling you or the law going of
Jesus on the other hand he's imitating Homeric epics and often he embeds his
imitations or the uses of the cue document inside of his imitations of
Homer and it's amazing how often that happens so today actually starts with
sayings that appear in the lost gospel and he contextualizes them in
narratives that he he gets from the Homeric epics or other poetry too the
reason he's doing that is because he's competing with Virgil's a need that
also imitates Homer so the the the genre of the gospel of Mark in my view is not
a biography of any kind it's a myth of origins it's trying to tell his readers
after the Jewish war how who their Lord is what their in group values are and how
they began who the bad people are and what they can hope for in the future and
so that's the crafting of an art it's it's an imitation of Homer to give
encouragement to people who have suffered after the Jewish war so if I may
interject here Dennis a couple of people actually fit the category you discuss in
your book the cue book that you're about to launch and Nathan Myers question or
statement really is in the category of the the two extremes in a way one
extreme is we couldn't have lost any sayings of Jesus the church would never
allow that to happen God would have preserved any potential earlier
material than Mark however in the other direction that seems to be hyper
skeptical is that Q is an assertion that gospel writers could not make anything
up but but making things up was the chief activity of all early Christians the
only thing they like better than burning so that's the other hyper extreme right
and and if I make a comment that allow you to elaborate is this tell me if you
think I'm on the money first of all if they had to make everything up and they're
great at making things up why is Luke borrowing from Matthew and Mark why is
Matthew borrowing from Mark yeah why are these gospel authors borrowing from
each other couldn't they have just made up their whole gospel of its own they're
dependent on other sources in order to craft their narratives so it seems the
modus operandi of gospel authors are to borrow from other existing models and
recraft their own narrative about Jesus so it's very likely on combine that with
the fact that you find material Matthew and Luke that is not in mark you know
this is what really brought people's attention is like well where did this
material come from did Matthew make all of this up or is there good reason to
also think that Matthew is dependent on early material and stuff so the list goes
on and on I don't think it's absurd because even Goodacre who I think really
has pushed an online wave of skeptics that are a anti-Q even Goodacre in his
engagement with you and other engagements pertaining to Q admits they are
dependent on other sources to write these gospels they're not like whole cloth
fabricating everything out of their own brains like Mark did not take a pen with
no other sources and just said I'm just gonna write everything out of my head
I'm gonna make all of it up no they're dependent on something and that's why
they say is it oral tradition is there an earlier source something is there and
even the most you know far hypothesis types grant that there's something they're
dependent on they just don't like to say you can reconstruct that something that's
right ultimately okay sorry I want to make sure I'm on the same page did you
want to comment on that at all or I would say it a bit differently I think but I
think you're you're moving in the right direction on that okay I would make a
distinction though between two different kinds of intertextual projects one
project is scribal that is that these take Matthew as an example the way he
treats mark is the way a creative scribe would treat mark so it's this
sometimes it's called redaction the Greeks Greek
Rhetoricians would call it metophysis metophysis is a rearrangement or a
revisioning of a text that's saying the same thing
memesis is a different story that is a literary imitation and that's using an
adesedent text as a model and so you're writing you're imitating something but
you're talking about something that is different and let me give you an example
Luke is rewriting Mark's passion narrative that's called metophysis in
Greek rhetoric but he's also imitating the death of Socrates in Plato's phyto and
that's memesis it's an use of a model for creating something different now the
you talked about the gospel authors writing things without any antecedents
the problem is that they had many antecedents and they treat them with
different methodologies so on the one hand you have scribalism and that's what
most commentaries emphasize when they look at the synoptics how they use the
word redaction which I don't like as a word I prefer metophysis is a way of
talking about it the way ancient rhetoricians would but they also are
doing memesis they're imitating models and that is what my primary contributions
have been to the field right and to identify some of these models people
recognize they're they're imitating things in the Hebrew Bible so that's not a
problem the problem is when you move into classical Greek poetry how dare you
yeah but they're not plagiarizing and they're not robbing they're not stealing
they're not stealing it's cultural engagement it's the way that Jews and
Christians identified themselves inside of the Greek society where the Homeric
epics were defining social identity and so you imitate and change and show that
your hero is more compassionate or more powerful or more holy or whatever
and so that it's a way of establishing for your in-group the ideal prototypical leader
and this has been established in in social identity theory before I find it very useful
to make sense of how these models work if I may do you remember the smart fool
oh yes I do yes very smart and clever and and they were questioning and you know
challenging trying to you know they've been reading you for years they have a super chat
oh wonderful yeah hope you're doing well reading your book on Andrew and it's great
you're not the only one there's several scholars that I think really love his work on Andrew and
by the way were persuaded of mimesis in your particular argumentation there
I'm writing an article that overlaps with your work and finding myself citing your work
looking forward to reading your next book oh smart fool I would did not expect to have that kind
of encouragement from you and it shows that you're not a damn fool after all you're just smart
yeah very smart oh that's awesome that is awesome yeah I think that you know this is
it's been a while since we've had Dennis here in person next trip I'll have to make down there to
you I want to make one more comment about to to smart fool please please I didn't discover
mimesis criticism by doing the gospels I did it from looking at christian apocryphal writings
especially the acts of Andrew but one can find it also in the acts of Paul to some extent the acts
of Thomas and these authors are christian and they're pious and they're orthodox they're not
heretical but they're using classical parallels classical models in order to craft their identity
for their audiences and it was a long it was almost 10 years after working on that material
that I realized it's happening in the New Testament too so I was late to the party
but the party was going on and the party is a lot of fun and I think that's one thing people don't
realize about mimesis criticism it requires one to engage in some of the most beautiful literature
that in my opinion stands as that standing as classics in human experience and if you haven't
read the ill-aid in the Odyssey no matter what you think of my work please enjoy Homer and the insight
and the wisdom and the cleverness of the poet thank you the smart fool I really appreciate it I hope
maybe you can reach out to me sometime I'd be curious to pick your brain and maybe even have
some chats with you because the engagements we've had in the past in terms of helping to sharpen up
what Dennis is saying and dealing with you know what scholars say those are always very fruitful
they help us progress the conversation and to get closer to what Dennis might say when a very smart
academic comes in and says I don't agree and here's why or here are my contentions or here are my
problems earlier we recorded one of my friend Landon Sykes on Facebook who's been a fan of
myth fiction for years a very critical kind of question and really what it sounds like is
what makes the scholars from what I can tell be hesitant about your mimesis is Matthew that Matthew
is this big sore thumb in their eyes like they're willing to jump on mark they're definitely able
to see Luke and acts and they're like all right we can do that Matthew comes in and he's it is written
it is written it is written and what's he do with mark's material is also what makes him go well
I don't know if I can draw that conclusion because they're you I feel like they're getting overwhelmed
with Matthew's interpretation of Mark and that's my opinion because I've seen it happen like the
young boy at the tomb right you have your own memetic connection they immediately say it was
an angel yep why because Matthew said it was an angel so should we make Matthew's interpretation of
mark what mark meant or should we go okay mark is actually doing something and Matthew has a different
agenda that's right and it's very Judaic it's very within the Jewish tradition and it is written kind
of agenda and so it's fantastic I don't know who's ultimately right what the truth is Dennis
but if I'm not playing with all the toys I can't tell you what which ones are the most
fun and stuff like that that's why I love your scholarship oh thank you yeah um thank you the
smart fool really appreciate that someone said uh someone left a comment a stinging
metal why doesn't Derek convert to Judaism or is Judaism like all the other religions
well every religion I would say is different or unique and do different things but yes I would
say it's just I don't have any reason for me pragmatically to desire keeping kosher or Sabbath
or any types of restrictions like that but I also don't believe the god of Judaism you know exists I
don't think Yahweh exists so there's several reasons why I wouldn't convert to Judaism or why I
remain a secular humanist but I appreciate the comment asking um let's see is there anything
I is there any questions that I missed Nathan Meyer says URL explains that Mark
cribbed practically everything he has his Jesus say from Paul what is remarkable is how little else
he has to work from well why where did he get his narratives I mean he must have had scripture
he Mark had to have had scripture the way that he crafts Jesus looks very much like Elijah and
Moses and all scenarios correct but it's downplayed to emphasize a what a Greco-Roman kind of
angle whereas Matthew really heightens it what would what would you say about that
you're gonna have to rephrase the question I'm not quite sure what you're I don't know who
the scholar is URL yeah explains that Mark cribbed practically everything he has his Jesus say
from Paul okay but you brought in the Hebrew Bible yeah unless I'm sure I could be mistaken
because he's saying specifically everything Jesus has but it says it comes from Paul right
there are very few places where you can explain the narratives in the gospel of Mark from Paul
but there is one that is really quite interesting namely the um the Last Supper business on the
day that the night that Jesus was betrayed he then had this meal with his disciples and the
language there is really very close to what one finds in the gospel of Mark and many people have
said and by the way most recently Robin Faith Walsh has argued that Mark may have known the Pauline
version called Paul's writing before Mark that's for sure and the parallels I think are really
quite amazing but and there are places there are about a dozen sayings that appear in Paul
that get attributed to Jesus in the Gospels so and most of those come from Q material in my view
so um there are places where you have overlaps between Paul and Paul and Mark
but um I don't know who this URL is but it certainly is an overstatement in my view so they
added though and I'm going to get through these super chats is obviously he picked plot points
from the Pentateuch and Homer sure yeah that's right you did so you're on the same page cool
all right the smart fool again is back says did you get my blog post addressing the video
response remember when we did our video response I went through the demonic example I was looking
and I think it means to say looking forward to any criticisms didn't hear back I must admit
I haven't been I just wrote this for those who are watching and aren't paying attention to the
chat I didn't go back to that site since then in fact I was actually someone sent me the link
of the criticisms because I don't stay on it what what site was that do you remember exactly what
that was I'd have to look it up someone helped me out in the chat here smart fool what site was
that exactly that I was on it's a well-known site that chat rooms or conversations and stuff are on
it not reddit is it was it reddit yes I think it is reddit okay reddit okay I haven't been on
there since since we last spoke I literally only went on there because someone was like hey check
this out they're engaging you Dennis I think like Robin Dennis Litwa you were getting thrown around
and there were people saying this person's better than that for you know there's different conversations
going on and we ended up engaging with this one because this one actually was I would say
sophisticated it was a good engagement even though you were criticizing the claims that
were being addressed there we need to look at the blog post though and remember we can do like a
remote okay response yeah we can't do it now because we haven't read the blog post
but uh I'd be interested to see what you have to say about that Dennis and of course see what he has
to say let me get another one Michael Beverly thank you so much for these super chats I appreciate it
I just bought Odyssey translated Robert Fagels Iliad by Emily Wilson did I do okay I was sort of
impulse shopping as I don't go out go to America much those are two beautiful translations
and I've only been dabbling with Emily Wilson for about two months and I've not gotten very far
let me both of them have limitations though one is that neither one observes the line numbers
in the Greek text and so you have to consult the Greek text by looking up the equivalent lines
and I find it somewhat tricky Fagels is in way the most literate of the translations and these also
done of the Iliad and it's available also reasonably with audiobooks and it really it's
really quite wonderful to be taken in through a great poet a modern poet the advantage of Emily
Wilson some people say it's because she's a woman that it's important well I don't know that that's
the case I don't want to stereotype men and women in this regard but I can tell you that one of the
beautiful things about her translation is that she's not interested so much in translating word
for word but in line for line even though she doesn't observe the lines herself and she's interested
in the emotional impact that the poetry delivers and so some of her turns of phrase and the way
she grips into the human experience in the translation is quite moving and beautiful
and I'm tempted in a book that I'm doing now after the the q-book it's called
synoptic epistles this is going to be interesting synoptic epistles and Homeric epics and I'm tempted
to use her translation in many passages just because of its emotional beauty and she has
an understanding of the Iliad which is really quite profound and I don't think I can use it much
but she says that usually the Iliad is thought of as a literature of male violence
and she says I think it really is an epic about the fragility of life and the emphasis for her
often is on the Trojan women who are losing their boys and their husbands and their lovers
and their fathers in the war and are fearful of being raped by Greek soldiers after the siege
and it is really emotionally powerful and I hope you enjoy reading Emily Wilson as much as I do
but if you're interested in the poetry itself I think fables is a great way to go
it's also wonderful to read Homer in Greek and I know that's difficult for everybody it still
is difficult for me but I've been doing it for 40 years so I think I've got a way to handle it
but enjoy Emily Wilson it's um and go with the emotion and not just with the poetry
thank you so much Im Nagan the Hizzy thank you so much for the super sticker my friend I did
not see a comment but I appreciate the love Michael Bell says responding to Q don't deal in
fantasies we have the gospels and that's enough written fantasy it is but the problem Michael
is that it doesn't answer all the critical questions about where this material is coming from
why do we have doublets and non-doublets of these gospels why in the materials that are
sayings that come out of a different cultural context so I we all have enough to do without
worrying about reconstructing texts I just happen to love these things and I'm interested in exploring
this an optic problem let me say one more thing Michael one of the things I find fascinating about
the Q document is that it comes out of a social location that is much closer to the historical
Jesus than any of the the gospels that are in the New Testament it's concerned about Galilee it
does not consider Jesus the Jewish Messiah it's not written by a Christian it's written by a Jew
prior to the Jewish war his issues are Jewish they had to they have to do with Jewish Torah
observance and that's why the Pharisees are the bad boys in this story and it the Q document
allows us to peel back from the gospels the layers that appear after the Christianization of Jesus's
image after the Jewish war after the preoccupation with what happened after the war in Judea
and get us closer to the historical Jesus now I don't think there's anything in the Q document we
can say Jesus actually said there's a lot in the Q document that tells us who he was in Jewish
society and what was going on so I don't think the issue is written foul fantasy I think the
issue is how these texts are identifying themselves with certain social issues political issues and
so on and it helps us understand the origins of the Christian movement and the images of Jesus
that informed it now I'm an atheist I'm not interested in theology I think it's boring
um I think the issue is human creativity and human struggle to make sense of the world
and that's what's going on in the gospels and I appreciate their efforts even though I don't
agree with them thank you so much Michael I appreciate the super chat um let me see we got
one couple more super chats then I saw a couple questions if we end up getting to them new to
the chat brave kestrel but love your channel I am recovering Christian and I have the religious
trauma that comes with an with the indoctrination and brainwashing I honestly blame my bpd on it
religion equals poison what are your comments I think religion um can be poisoned I also think
it can be uh a cure and I think one needs to assess religion on the basis of what I call
ethical pragmatism what does religion do now religion often helps to create schools
at hospitals and elementary institutions and it can also create warfare and um
ban abortions when people when women need them and um I'm a graduate of bob jones university
a fundamentalist uh university and I was damaged by religion I think that's one reason that I'm a
humanist but um we're not going to get rid and get rid of religion any worse and we're not going
to get rid of religion any easier than we're going to get rid of music I'm a musician myself
I play a five string banjo in irish pub groups and uh uh bluegrass and all that I love music
I do not like bad music and music can do all kinds of wonderful things and it can do some
pretty miserable things that's my attitude toward the religion we're going to live with religion
but we have to make sure that religion is smart and it doesn't harm people in it
and um brave kestrel I'm glad that you're you've um broken away from bad religion
and I hope you find meaning um in whatever is good for you my attitude toward life and
Derek knows this very well we've talked about it often
my understanding of ethics is the creation of something beautiful and I don't mean that as
just music I mean it as a beautiful um environment I mean it as beautiful human relations I mean it
as peace and I know that that's as woke as it can be and I am so I want to have a t-shirt that says
I'd rather be woke than asleep right and I think there are so many people who make um
who make fun of wokeness I'm proud to be woke I think that's what we need and brave kestrel maybe
you can uh join me in uh in being woke in this way but uh I'm sorry that religion was a poisonous
for you thank you for that super chat my friend Lana Spencer thank you so much for the super
sticker I was looking for a comment in case you did have one or a question or something but I
really do appreciate it I didn't see one I did not see one thank you so much for the support
really appreciate it um im nag I've seen a few documentaries stating that the Flavians wrote
the four books of the New Testament is that a real possibility no you're gonna have to comment on that
one I I've heard that uh advanced I don't know what they have possibly is the arguments for it
um so I really don't know what I can say if it if I'm not familiar with the arguments
well it's I know that it's mainly a lot of it's like pro-Roman
pro-Roman materials and of course you have some people like uh you've never have you ever read
Joseph Atwell's Caesar's Messiah no I got the synod to you but it's a connection to what he's
trying to do is connect uh Josephus into the gospel narrative the passion narrative with Jesus
and saying that Titus is Titus's military campaign overlaps with Jesus now his interpretation
technically is that the gospels and he thinks they're all written like in one room or in the
same area with different authors that are writing like he has a his own unique interpretation of
the gospels um but he thinks that uh they're like spoofs to trick Jews into worshiping Titus
because they won't worship anyone other than their gods there's like a joke on them
and I at one point I thought whoa you know at first when I came across this because I was like
experimenting and checking out all these stuff like dude this is it there are some interesting
elements that you find in Josephus that I was pretty interested to see but he like parallels them
and acts like Jesus is technically Titus incognito and it's all about getting you to secretly worship
Titus Vespasian yeah yeah yeah but um that that'd be one example there are various forms of what
they call Roman provenance but ultimately it's this angle that is suggesting that the gospels are
pro-Roman and because they're pro-Roman they and they survive and what we have that seem to be
I'll tell you Mark is not pro-Roman okay so we'll just start there and it's the earliest of the
gospels and the other gospels are are indebted to it um Mark is clearly anti-Roman he's writing
after the Jewish war he knows the story of the healing of this insurian son and he changes it
so that they the son becomes Jewish the demons in the garrison demoniac are called legion and
he's drowned in the sea and this comes from gyrosh gyrosh was used as a military compound
and on the shields of the 10th legion of the Romans there was a bore I can't imagine that
um Mark would have any truck with anything in Rome um so sorry about that thank you thank you
appreciate it appreciate it I think we caught up on those and now I'm going to go up to a
couple of these chats until we get another super chat that were interesting comments I think I saw
bear with me bear with me
Oh Lana Spencer said I've listened to Dr. McDonald's course twice already I'm going to listen a few
more times highly recommend it for to everyone I also have his books thank you all so much
so that was the comment I missed Lana Spencer's comment thank you Lana I appreciate it very much
yeah thank you oh this was an interesting one I saw Liberty Jackson Myth Vision podcast what
does Dr. McDonald think about the anti-Semitism in Matthew and John and the church fathers
well those um let's do Matthew and John uh and if you want to uh Liberty if you want to pursue
church fathers we can do that the anti-Semitism um in Matthew first Matthew is written after
the Jewish war and is rewriting the gospel of Mark which he thinks is a bit too much in the
direction of Hellenism and the the community of that Mark is Matthew's writing to and I don't mean
as a community I mean as readers are involved in a reinterpretation of Judaism after the Jewish
war which has to do with now that the temple is destroyed and a recreation of Judaism where its
primary locus of authority is going to be in synagogues and its primary authority is not going
to be priesthood but it's going to be the texts namely the Pentateuch and so Matthew is placing
Jesus in the context of a contested understanding of the heritage of Moses and the law and the prophets
so I like to think of Matthew's anti-Semitism to be something like this unless your righteousness
exceeds that of scribes and Pharisees you'll not enter the kingdom of God so that its competitive
Judaism it's not anti-Semitism at all it's competitive Judaism that we are the better
heirs of the Jewish tradition so I would get rid of anti-Semitism and talk about it as Jewish
rivalry okay the Gospel of John is a different story it's really written probably in three different
stages and the first stage is interested in depicting Jesus as a new Dionysus where Jesus
like Dionysus can offer wine to people and promise eternal life if they imbibe his flesh and drink his
blood but that text then gets rewritten in what I call the anti-Jewish Gospel and this is a place
where it is likely written after Johannine Christians have been expelled from the synagogue
probably happens around 120 125 and actually we know of that also in Jewish texts and the
Johannine community has been so burned by the exclusion that they are trying to
and this is where you get the really hostile anti-Jewishism and this is anti-Semitism in the
Gospel of John and you know you were of your father the devil he was a murderer from the
beginning and so on that kind of rhetoric it has no place in humanist discourse in my view I think
he's just reprehensible so whereas Matthew's involved in Jewish competitiveness John is
complaining about the middle section of John the second edition of John is written
to make Jesus anti-Jewish in this case and he's the proper architect of the Jewish tradition
so that anyway I guess I would say that so technically Matthew can be interpreted and
seems to have been interpreted by early church fathers and such in a manner that was utilized
to kind of couple with John right like this it could be used in an anti-Semitic way even though
you're suggesting the author or the original authorial intent is this is showing competitive
Jewish sex and one is demonizing the other in group out group. I'll give you an example
Jesus says in Matthew but not in Q or in Mark and it's different also from Luke and John he says
the rabbis basically sit on the throne of Moses do what they say just don't do what they do
and so he argues that those who obey Torah are going to be have a higher righteousness than those
who are actually in competitive synagogues and he the author also uses an unusually important
expression their synagogue so it's a distinction between the synagogue that or the synagogues
or worship of the the communities that Matthew's addressing but do you also have their synagogue
specific buildings okay okay next super chat Michael Beverly why what is Mark doing with the post
baptism visit to the desert where Satan shows up actually Mark gets that from the Q document
and the Q document has done so in order to fit a kind of mythic pattern that you also
find by the way in the Odyssey young Telemachus Odysseus's son has a visitation by Athena who
flies to him by the way reassures him that he's the son of Odysseus and says you've got to go
and kick butt in your house to get rid of the suitors and so when he goes to the suitors
he's trying to claim back his kingdom and he's going to have to resist them and in the end with
his father he's going to kill the suitors and take responsibility of the kingdom in the Q document
the same thing happens that's holy spirit or the spirit of God flies to Jesus like a dove
so he a heavenly voice says you are my beloved son then the devil offers him the kingdoms of
the world and Jesus refuses it because he knows now that he's God's son he's responsible for God's
kingdom so as soon as he goes to Galilee what does he say he says repent the kingdom of God
is upon you it is arrived and so Jesus is crowned as the prince in a sense but he has
to show his medal that he's worth it by the way this is a part of the hero cycle that's been
recognized that young men often like Gilgamesh have to face a dragon or a challenge early in their
careers to show them their medal and that they're worthy of being a hero and then they go and they
have their exploits and careers so this and by the way the Buddha has a similar experience
before he goes out and cares for the poor and preaches enlightenment thank you we've got another
one up here Merlin shocked thank you so much for the super chat appreciate it and they asked
wondering what Dennis thinks about astrothiology and its possible influence on the gospels
by astrothiology i'm assuming that you mean certain kinds of astrological
calculations and so on i don't think there's any real influence on the gospels to be honest with
you and i'm sure that you wanted a longer answer i don't know that i have one for you yeah and i
think that just to give a little more context is usually it's not just calculations but they'll see
characters like usually that play a role like there's a scene in i think it's a mark where it says
that the man's man carrying the water pitcher um to that house follow him isn't it mark yeah so um i've
had a scholar or uh i think he's a scholar you know he's a bible thinker for a long time bill
darlesson who thought that this might actually be a query us in some symbolic way of a man
carrying a pitcher of water because women usually did so at this time and so why is this man carrying
a pitcher of water into this house maybe this is some type of astrothiological in the myth of the
gospel story hinting at the at the heavens but you have a wonderful Homeric explanation for that
follow um yeah it's a water carrying woman that uh leads Odysseus's search party into the castle
of the elastragonians who are cannibals and they eat lots of Odysseus's men so they follow
this water carrier into an upper room now the reason that you have a man in the gospel of mark
is if you tell your search party go and find a woman that's carrying water they're going to find
hundreds of women that are carrying water you have to have a man carrying water to be distinctive
so you know who to follow to the to the upper room that'd be my explanation thank you so much
merlin i appreciate the love and support um ralph gt thank you for the super chat looking to make
sure i didn't miss any calm oh there you are the god an anatomy book by dr starak apulu gave me a
great idea for a novel that book is you haven't read it probably but it's it's fantastic i really
enjoyed that is that right oh yeah big time thank you ralph appreciate that i look forward to seeing
what you come up with um is it um magelio um magelio montagna good topic because i always
wondered why christians reject being jewish when they're god jesus is jewish i think it's tell me
if you think this this is where i think this is coming from paul is working overtime to get non-jews
into the movement in doing so he's saying you don't need to become a jew because a jew is one
inward and not outward so you technically are a jew but you don't need to circumcise and follow
these laws and blah blah blah blah just join us because tomorrow the income's anyway etc etc
and they join and that starts what i would call snowball effect that over time gets bigger and
more and more not so jewish i guess you'd say what would you say well it's a fascinating question
paul understood his um so-called conversion not as a conversion of religion but an opening up of
the promises of the biblical israel to gentiles and so the gentiles that are invited to the the
paulian circles are in then understood to be uh welcome to the fortunes of israel but paul is
still jewish he expects his group to be the the the rightful heirs of judaism later again this
christian identity theory becomes important later the christian communities over us and
distancing themselves from judaism and demonizing judaism as we saw in the gospel of job
so i think the issue he has to do with the growing identity and distance of the christian
movement from judaism thank you so much for that super chat the smart fool is back i'm open to
Dionysus influence in line but meyer i think that's a scholar shows convincingly the second
edition evangelist adding that scene and themes not in first layer um a smart fool that's a very
smart question and the question then becomes what criteria does one use to determine what's in the
first edition or in the second edition and i think the evidence is really quite overwhelming
that the um dianese dianesean influence is right at the beginning and um again i'd have to show
you the evidence for it but i'll give you one little piece of it that's i think quite fascinating
the um in the the dianesean gospel or in in there are two layers of tradition in the in the
fourth gospel um and they have to do with who is responsible who's who's the enemy of jesus
in these narratives in the early versions uh in the first version the enemies are always the
jewish leaders chief priests um and scribes and and Pharisees and so on in the second edition
where you have anti judaism it's the jews who are a problem the entire religion of judaism
or judaians um is the problem now it's very difficult for me to imagine it moving in the
other direction that it's the jews who are the problem already and then you have in the dianesean
level it kind of settles down and it's only their leaders it's it's not jews i just don't think that
makes sense in terms of the development of the community but there are other reasons too and so
i would say that the the dianesean influence is is earlier um in i have a long discussion by the way
of the uh the stratigraphy of the gospel of john in its compositions and i lay out the criteria
there and by the way that i'm not so original on that other people hold the same criteria in the
same stratigraphy the same layer layer wise now does anyone else agree with your dianesean
layer yes they do as a matter of fact and there's going to be apparently a commentary around the
gospel of john that um uh i don't know who's going to give it it's actually written by a south
african okay well i just to find common ground here on dianesis influence and wine i don't now
that i know what i know i don't know any other way to understand that without like butchering that
that common element that dianesis is turning water into wine or even milk into wine depending on
source so there's several sources of course that describe the miracle of him transforming fluids
into wine and um i just don't get why why scholars what do you think the hesitation is on that one
of why just i think they're they're nervous about having a gospel author imitating uh dianesis
by the way let me just say one one other thing that i think has not been understood well
the gospel of john knows the yeah every level of the composition of the gospel of john
they know the synoptic gospels i think the the evidence is overwhelming
but the gospels uh of the synoptic gospels are really hard on the reader take up your cross
and follow me hate your father and mother there's there are uh treasures laid up for you in heaven
if you're hated by the authorities and so all that you have but dianesis is the donor deity
he gives you wine he gives you love he gives you a happy time now in this life
and i think the gospel of john is competing with dianese in religion and that's why in the
opening chapter of the gospel of john the the author goes out of his way to say that jesus
life he gives gift after gift and he he tended among us and he gives us these gifts you don't
find anything like that in the synoptic gospels the gospel of john is interested in competing
with dianesis to say that jesus can give you a good time too and and hang fashi forgive me i have
to get this because i love it when these happen just fascinating you guys hate christianity with a
passion grant you don't get me i live in a community of retired missionaries i'm not against religion
i'm against stupidity i'm against people being ignorant of their origins i love these texts as
much as anyone i know and i admire the creativity of what they're trying to accomplish especially
when you compare them to the greek mythologies i am not against the christian religion i'm against
harmful christian religion you bet yeah um i can i comment on this at this point of course so
oh nice you called me ignorant well if someone doesn't know you and you make a false statement
that is ignorant is it wrong to say what you just said was ignorant first of all now i didn't say you
were ignorant no but by the fact that the claim he's saying you just hate christianity and you're
correcting that and saying no no no i don't i just don't believe it anymore and i love the literature
and stuff um in a sense they're they're interpreting that as you call them ignorant like they don't
understand that and i would say grant that you misunderstood what i intended yeah anyway um
just helps get the chat you know route up and stuff all right we got another one hang for she
in the house thank you for the support recently i read an essay uh was it repareable of the goods
american the author suggested the greek adverb for near was shifted to a noun in english neighbor
is there anything to this that would be a radically different you know reading so it's like those who
are near you rather than just being your neighbor um have you heard that or read that anywhere
well placean does mean somebody i believe that's the greek word placean um
no i guess i don't know quite how to uh look at it fight a greek text in front of me it would help
yeah but i'm not sure i know on i don't know how that matters the parable of good Samaritan
um there's there might be something to it well you know the lesson of course is to
be good to your neighbors and and you know obviously in this case it's the jews themselves
are other people of his own kind of we're not helping him and then a stranger you know i'm
sorry i'm not familiar with it all right all right thank you hang for i'm sorry we couldn't
give you more on that specifically um i really do appreciate the support though grandmaster stash
thank you for the super chat did grandmaster have a question i don't see a question
i do not see a question i don't see a question okay thank you so much for the support i just
like to make sure i don't leave anybody hanging you know sure okay denis this book's out right now
this book is you're like really almost everything you've written in some way form or fashion even
though it's not as extensive um you've written several of the books i pulled the diagnosing
gospel off you've got all sorts of stuff and you have two books that are in the works right now
one is any day probably within the next two to three days going to be launched correct oh it's
probably going to be longer than that because we have to finish the uh they cover i'm waiting for
one more of the endorsements that's been promised um so i'm not sure it'll almost certainly be out
by uh march first so um give me a month and we'll have it out okay and then one more super chat
here merlin shocked says any thoughts on which if any christian denomination is the best
which would be your subjective opinion any thoughts on orthodox verse catholic orthodox
seems more symbolically oriented so the first question i'm going to answer is related probably
to protestantism then i'll talk about orthodoxy and catholicism um the one question i would have
is do you consider unitarians and universalists a christian denomination and that denomination
itself is divided by those who identify themselves with the christian protestant tradition those who
understand themselves to be humanists but i think um the advantage of um that discourse
is that it incorporates things as a universe as a unitarian uh of different religions and
seeks wisdom from them all my issue with them is they still are theistic and i'm an atheist
and so i would think that they that is really a wonderful way of being um theological and having
a sense of god which is universal and attempts to gain wisdom from various groups those who are
most clearly identified with the christian tradition i would think would include the
united church of christ that i belong to for quite a while um at certain kinds of men and
night groups are are wonderful again i would use ethical pragmatism to determine which groups are
are best for the human race and for the environment i have my problems with all forms of orthodoxy
in despite the beautiful um intellectual and liturgical traditions of orthodoxy
and the problem is that unfortunately orthodoxy has become too orthodox by that i mean that it
does not allow for diversity and it is unquestioning of um it's scholarship so i've had many orthodox
students and i've been at their ordinations and i've found them to be almost always unteachable
because they are so protective of doctrine and the history of the tradition that they can't absorb
um um this the uh uh the questioning that goes along with this i have friends in egypt now
who have to worry about being imprisoned because they have questions about the historicity of
the gospels and this is really a tragedy by the way um think of it this way the russian orthodox
church blessed putin and the war on ukraine is a holy war you tell me if that church has any
prophetic voice to its own people about genocide and and by the way i have orthodox friends who
agree with me that that is a major blemish on orthodoxy its inability to speak to power with
uh with prophecy on the other hand it gives encouragement to lots of people who are looking
forward to the afterlife and so on uh catholicism is such um a complex phenomenon right now
and i have very good friends who are faithful catholics who are so upset about what's going
on with the catholic hierarchy the obsession with abortion issues with their attitudes toward
the sexual abuse of priests and so on and they say this is our community but we're embarrassed
by our community and we're doing the best we can but on the other hand catholics have been very
good on social welfare going in their um integration issues uh in you know the um so there's so much to
be said about the intellectual tradition and liturgical traditions ethical traditions of
catholicism unfortunately it's not living up to its best um do its best values thank you thank you
no where am i i guess the gypsy prince thank you the gypsy prince for the support i appreciate the
love let me scroll here is it adriana gentlemen thank you for the super chat new question here
just love and learning from midfusion only found your channel a few months ago thank you appreciate
that i'm glad it glad it uh is helpful our friend here again says derrick we appreciate your
in-depth that lectures on comparative mythology i think that's you and me in that one that we did
together i imagine um particularly regarding greek mythology it's monumental so i suspect that's the
course that you and i did okay i suspect yeah i could it could be wrong but uh thank you so much
for that and just want to make sure i hit it hit everything before i exit here because we have to
go in just a second sign up for the course speaking of which that me and him did 18 lectures goes into
the memesis criticism i'm going to say one thing while you're you're looking about this book called
synoptic epistles in homeric epics and it should be out around july 1st and it consists of 32
apocryphal epistles that i wrote giving voice to the various uh gospel authors including the author
of q and they argue with each other so the subtitle has to do with how the gospel authors
clashed with each other and and so how matthew is not happy with things that mark says the q
author is not happy with things that mark says uh luke gives his comments about all of his
predecessors and so on and it's and so these are letter exchanges between the apostles uh or the
the evangelists saying what they like and don't like about each other's work and it was so much
fun to write so my other books have been on what the gospel authors did with the homer or q or
whatever and with each other this is a book about how and why they did so and so i'm getting into
the motivations of the various authors and it was so much fun to write and it's a there's nothing
like it out there and it's it's going to be a lot of fun to read i know a few people have read it
like me richard miller we've got you know read into it at least some i guess the best way i'd
paint it is you know the models that scholarship has on what matthew's doing to mark's text where we
see he's clearly lifting from mark and changing things or luke to mathew or luke to mark or whatever
and i'm using the most well established because i know q comes into this but just for our audience
sake right now what denis is doing is creating hypothetical conversations that are based off
good interpretive models using methodologies that he has on why matthew is arguing with mark
what the hell were you thinking mark i can't believe you put that's no no this is the right
way to do it and then mark's go what why did you change my you know and like he's gonna have
these that's what it is it's going to be exciting it's i think it'd be really good all right
william arons thank you to the super chat my friend always been here you've been here for a
long time and i really appreciate it as someone who is still christian i don't find either of you a
threat i believe each branch of christianity needs to see themselves on their own autosies
each with separate heroes and journeys i actually have fans who are um in the ministry
especially protestant ministry and they say that it gives them new insights into the new
testament that they hadn't had before and they appreciate that it um it solves some questions
for them and again i'm not anti christian um so um i'm i'm great i live in a retirement
community where there are a lot of the retired missionaries and they're really interested in
this kind of thing this discourse matters to them so william i'm so glad that you find some insight
from this and yes we're all on our own autosies and um uh yep my chip might be a little bigger on
my shoulder than denises but i'm definitely not trying to be harmful in any way to people you
know or whatever i definitely like the challenge i like to challenge the thinking and why i don't
draw those conclusions but william you know you're always welcome here and i do appreciate
you being here thank you the gypsy prince where jesus his followers or word jesus word jesus
his followers really fishermen or was that a mythical title for the apostles of the christian
cult because they were fishers for men gypsy prince that's a fun question and i've got a
fun answer for you no they weren't fishermen and it's not the mythical title of the apostles
it rather is an imitation of odyssey book two when athena disguised as telemachus gets him a ship
and a crew in order to sail off to find out about his father as a part of creating his
recovering his kingdom and his estate back home and the gospel of mark is the first person ever
to have called the body of water in galilee the sea of galilee and he needs a boat and a crew in
order to sail from side to side of that large lake but it certainly isn't a sea and we know that
the q document has its own way of talking about jesus acquiring followers but they're not fishermen
and the gospel of luke knows that this is coming from odyssey too because he embellishes it
with another poem called the Homeric hymn to Dionysus so it's it's it's based on a Homeric myth
uh and a Homeric hymn but it also is a revision of the q document and jesus acquiring
followers but mark is going to need a ship and the sea of galilee and a crew
and so that's why they become fishers for humans thank you so much um the name
hold on hold on aunt juror was saying myth vision podcast gypsy is a slur please stop saying it
the gypsy prince is the name of the super chatter so i didn't know what word they were talking about
and uh i don't know would you what do you have any clue about the history of that um
um
i'm not going to comment on why someone who's admiring this discussion wants to identify
as a gypsy um yes from outsiders a gypsy uh by the way it just means egyptian
that's where the word comes from um so a gypsy prince could say that they're identifying themselves
with uh the people who are on the outside or creative people i don't have any antipathy for
gypsies in fact they're better called roma um and so but i understand the allergy and the
allergy to the name gypsy when it's used as a slur so i i can understand that i definitely was
reading that's just normal like i didn't see anything you know i don't know anyway thank you so much
appreciate everybody being uh positive and having a good time here hanging out with me and denis
stay tuned two books are on their way and uh i plan on making some trips down to cali to come
see him and dr richard c miller at some point we have to do some more recordings and i want both
of you guys the same we got to get you together and like go out this stuff so and let you guys
you know give each other paths in the back what do you like about each other stuff and then
also critique you know what you think you could do maybe different or whatever i don't know we'll
we'll see how it goes so anyway i love you everybody thank you so much you have a wonderful
day and let's do this again any final words create something beautiful find out where your
life is going and how you can use that life in creating something beautiful for the environment
for the human community for health and be good to yourselves that way thank you
