Dr. Mark Goodacre, Francis Hill Fox Professor at Duke University.
Is it of religious studies?
Okay, I just want to make sure I added the little cherry on the top.
And we do like talking about religious studies because one of the things that happens in
a religious studies department like the one that I am in is that nobody coming to class
is expected to share what their kind of particular faith perspective is.
So people come from all faith perspectives and none.
And the thing about a religious studies context rather than say a theological context or something
like that is we are not training ministers, we are just training people to think and to
think critically and to explore the work.
So we do kind of like that term religious studies because it distinguishes us.
Not that there is anything wrong with people that study.
Some of my best friends are theologians but it makes me a little bit different from them.
And I like that.
It gives people an opportunity to kind of explore it without worrying about potential
theological implications.
It's like you can go into this, you can leave, you don't feel that there is pressure in any
way because that can sometimes happen especially when you get to fundamentalist of course.
And I don't say your friends are not saying that.
Evangelical maybe but you guys are obviously more technical.
The question I would like to ask and it's more like if you could take us on a trip.
A chronological trip.
I think too often and I am guilty of this oh so often it's like we were raised this
way in church.
We start with Matthew even.
We don't even go to Mark.
I have a really good friend also by the way he'd love to debate you on this topic.
But anyway you're always one and people want you to debate him.
Can you take us on a chronological airplane journey on the New Testament that we have
the evidence that we have.
Not only of the character and Paul, his literature going into the gospels and then of course later
on what we have but maybe even fill in a little detail, give a little furniture and say what
is actually happening in the New Testament.
What is this, if I could use the term story even though there are multiple books and they
often times don't line up, they're not meant to be in agreement technically in many ways.
What is the story of the New Testament?
Well I suppose we do tend to read canonically.
We read in order and I'm estimate whenever I'm teaching introduction to the New Testament
which I like to do every couple of years or so, I find it really difficult to know where
to start because there is that deep pull from our culture and from upbringing and all the
rest of it which says you begin with the gospels right, you always begin and of course even
though the gospels are written later than Paul, they're still dealing with events earlier
than Paul so should you begin with the gospels or should you begin with Paul and I go round
and round on this one and sometimes I begin one way, sometimes I do it the other way but
if you wanted to look at the chronology in terms of what came first, in terms of writings,
not the characters in them or whatever, then you will always begin with Paul and probably
if anybody wants to sort of begin reading the New Testament for the first time, great
way to start is read one Thessalonians or first Thessalonians we call it in American English.
So one Thessalonians probably written as early as the forties of the first century.
This is within a generation of the death of Jesus right and you get there a real sense
of what it was like being one of these early Jesus followers because Paul is having to
tell the Thessalonians all about what's going to happen when they die because people have
started dying and they seem to be worrying about people dying because Jesus hasn't come
back yet right so Paul has this and you get that real sense of urgency and so I think
beginning with one Thessalonians is a fantastic way to start and you can work on through this
if you read one Corinthians which I think is also pretty early I think probably as early
as like the early fifties within 20 years or so of Jesus' crucifixion.
One Corinthians is full of interesting details about the earliest Christian communities.
Paul talks about people's households and they're clearly not meeting.
See when we say church we imagine building big ornate fancy building usually right.
When Paul's saying church he means people gathering together in a house.
Not a synagogue.
Right.
Interesting.
So you've got this going on and Paul even talks and he gives names of some of these
people.
Chloe's people he mentions at one stage and so you read through that and Paul's having
to sort of legislate on the fly as well because you've got people saying are we like a divorce
or not?
Are we allowed?
Am I allowed to take my Christian brother to court or not and so Paul is actually legislating
on the fly.
Oh my goodness what we're going to do because you know he hasn't always got a saying of
Jesus for everything and occasionally he does have he says like when it comes to divorce
and remarriage he says okay this is what the Lord said.
With other stuff he has to go okay well this is what I think and I think I've got the spirit
of God so you know you should be doing what I'm saying so he's really and again you get
that rawness and that earlyness so it's very exciting to read that and then you can carry
on working through Paul's letters like that and end with Romans because Romans is the
most complicated and dense theologically and all the rest of it and then you want to
go from there and then read Mark's Gospel.
Mark's Gospel I think is written in the early 70s somewhere around there it's after the
big Jewish war with Rome it's after the fall of Jerusalem I think Mark is kind of influenced
by Paul and by the Pauline movement but it's now telling the story of Jesus and reading
Mark's Gospel again a bit of rawness a bit of kind of you know there's a sort of there's
a almost like a brutish genius to Mark because it's written in this rough and ready style
like immediately this and immediately that then this then this then this you know all
sort of like breathless sometimes he doesn't even finish his sentences you know there's
a lovely bit in the story where Jesus is healing the paralyzed man and Jesus says in order that
you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins and then that's it
doesn't doesn't finish the sentence just stops and then Mark goes on he says to the paralyzed
man you know it's like hold on a minute you were just talking then you know so you have
this fantastic you know kind of rawness there but there's a sort of literary genius about
Mark as well it's a beautifully crafted book beautifully crafted book fantastically structured
and Mark I think gives birth to Matthew because Matthew likes Mark but is dissatisfied with
it gives birth to Luke because Luke is dissatisfied and wants to improve it and and so so that's
if you want to take a chronologically right that's how I would go I would go one Thessalonians
one Corinthians Galatians then work through some of the rest of Paul then hit the Gospels
but go Mark first then Matthew then Luke then John that's how I would that's how I would
do it would you say some of the pastorals and stuff kind of fall into the gaps between
some of the or would you say like between Luke and John do you know what I have never
really confession time I've never really enjoyed the pastoral epistles I remember when I was
doing my I did an M fill in between my my first degree in my doctorate and as part of
the M for we had to translate the whole of the New Testament just just sort of work through
and then you could be examined on any bit of it getting to the pastoral and feeling
so kind of when is this gonna end I mean it sounds it's awful thing to say I know some
people we were scandalized by by my saying this but I find it I don't find them very
exciting myself you know to study I realize that other people have found them exciting
I think also I find some of what it says about about women very difficult to read and so
on so yeah but I think they're later I don't think that they're written by Paul I think
that they could be as late as the early second century I appreciate that so then the question
I guess would you say in light of this and I try to give a chronology right but we're
going to be talking in a sense about fundamentalist approaches to this right clearly being a scholar
see multiple messages it's not a single cohesive one message I'd even argue one gospel so speak
where do you stand on the whole Paul and James and Peter thing right at least early on I mean
I don't know if you believe the harmonization is accurate later in acts but are they friends
that's a tough one for you well the I mean one way of looking at these things new religious
movements are often born out of conflict right yes because you have one key character that
says it was like this and then somebody else comes I guess I think it's like this right
and then in the debate between those things you get the formulation of ideas and theology
is born out of that conflict and Christianity if we can say Christianity isn't any different
from that I mean the earliest period not really talking about Christianity is a religion we're
talking about a group of Jewish followers of Jesus who thought he was the Messiah and so on
but what happens is I think that Paul has these really really difficult debates with people like
Peter and James Jesus's brother and out of those debates a lot of his theology is formed I mean
that's clear you read the epistle to the Galatians he's in a proper serious argument there about
whether or not Gentile Christians Gentile converts to the Jesus movement should be
circumcised or not the males right should they be circumcised or not and Paul is adamant they
should not and it's very clear that other people thought that they should and so out of that
conflict is born this this fascinating theology that Paul has all about being justified by faith
being made righteous by faith this this this sort of thing comes out of that out of that
difficult debate Paul and Peter though who knows whether they ever actually made up it's clear
in Galatians 2 that there was a standard row between Paul and Peter in Antioch absolute
standard row Paul calls Peter a hypocrite right now you know I'm lucky I've never had a standard
row in public with anybody where they call me a hypocrite but if it ever happens it's gonna
take me a little while to get over that yeah did Peter ever get over we don't know I mean in acts
of the Apostles we have we do have a I think acts 15 seems to tell a similar story to Galatians 2
but it's much more of a harmonious happy kind of story that there's there's links with the
story but it's a much happier kind of story so but even in acts you never see Peter after acts
15 he's gone yeah he's gone he vanishes from the story I mean Luke has Luke just written him out of
the story at this point so it's a tough one I suspect that they never really fully made up you
know after that you know I mean there's this extraordinary line I think it's like real pathos
in Galatians 2 where Paul says even Barnabas was led astray by the hypocrisy you know and Barnabas
his good friend that he's he's been you know suffering weird and he's been in prison with
and he's been having a hard time with another rest of it his best mate Barnabas even he
seeds over to the other side to Peter's side and you know you don't hear about Barnabas again
in Paul's letters he's gone after Galatians 2 Barnabas has gone right so I think that that split
that divide was was was is now when you get to the epistle to the Romans which Paul writes later
Paul is in a much more ironic peaceful kind of mode and although Peter's not mentioned there and
Barnabas isn't mentioned there as well you can see him making overtures towards people that would
have views more like Peter's Peter's view and you read Romans 16 which some people might think is
the most boring chapter in Romans which is the last chapter it just has a whole bunch of names
and there you can see that Paul has got quite a lot of friends in Rome in the early Christian
movement the emerging Christian movement and he's working through lots of the lots of these
kind of friendship networks to try and say I'm not you might have heard these terrible things
about me but actually I'm okay actually I'm okay I am part of this this movement you might have
heard terrible things about me but actually don't worry I'm okay you know and listen to the list of
some of my friends you know I'm friends with Chris Granoquilla and I'm friends with Andronicus and
junior and these people have been in the movement for years you know so that's really what he's
doing there so Paul does have that ironic side to him where he's trying to overture towards the
side that previously was perhaps the one that was battling against him. Wow my recent interview I did
with Steve Mason was on the first generation of Christians and we were talking about Paul and this
is amazing he said it's like it's like overhearing a phone conversation and you you hear the one
side and you get a taste you know there's something going on Paul's trying to it makes me wonder like
is James and Peter and I'd say James and Peter as if they're individually separate in their ideas I
don't know I'm just I throw them together because it's always Paul Saul and Peter or Keefus and
James and I wonder if they were going around saying no he's not one of us and we see the
pseudo clementine seemed to like indicate this debate which is fictitious but nonetheless it's
like this debate between Peter saying look are you sure you didn't hear from a spirit a devil a
demon or ghost or you know yeah it's it's um it's it's definitely the case that you've got you've
got some let me you said I'm really interested in their beginning job but remind me about Steve
Mason and half conversations and the idea that if they were going around saying he's not one of us
yeah one of the things that we do when we're reading Paul is is this mirror reading where
you're actually trying to reconstruct the other side of the conversation and it's exactly like
that it's like hearing I remember being in Whole Foods once in Durham and I could hear somebody on
having a really really serious phone call and I assumed it was with it was it was a woman I
assumed she's talking to a boyfriend or a girlfriend that was in the process of breaking up with them
well over the phone in Whole Foods and that's just me reconstructing it because of the kind of things
that she was saying quite it was kind of I felt it was like this weird eavesdropping thing because
I was on the other side but I was listening to that and and later that day I was teaching Paul so
I told my students this story hoping that it wasn't one of my students don't think it was didn't
recognize the voice but I told them this story because it's listening to half of a conversation
but I could I could put two and two together and work out what was going on in that conversation
that's really what it's like reading the epistle to the Galatians you're reading half
of a conversation and that does make it difficult because then you've got to try and imagine what
the other side's saying because Paul doesn't isn't necessarily fair to the other side he might be
let's face it whenever any of us have arguments we put a spin on it right yeah you know and so
Paul's clearly putting a spin on it like when he's telling the story about his big fight with Peter
we haven't got Peter's version of that story maybe Peter thought Paul was the one being a
hypocrite right right so so yes absolutely it's not just behind the pages of the New Testament
we have conflict it's on the pages of the New Testament it's there loud and clear we haven't
got to kind of construct hypothetical conversations and things they're there and in the pages it's
very clear I just wonder I would love to find something that showed us the other side yeah yeah
wouldn't that be great you can get little hints of it in the sense that Matthew's Gospel for
example does seem to try to rein in some of that rather gentle leaning Jesus of Mark's Gospel I
Mark's Gospel is a bit strange in the sense that Jesus mainly comes into contact with fellow Jews
but every now and then he'll meet a he'll he'll meet a gentile and and you can tell that Mark's
trying to really big up this Jesus is you know is friendly to gentiles but Mark hasn't really
got many stories to play with and one of the stories the Syrophoenician woman in in Mark 7
he's actually quite Jesus is actually quite rude to this woman right it's not right to take you know
the children's food and and give it to the dogs it's quite a rude thing to say all right and
the woman of course has this brilliant answer yes but even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall
from the rich man's table so Mark is this kind of gentle leaning gospel just and I assume that's
because Mark is sympathetic to the Pauline mission which is very kind of Gentile friendly and I think
then Matthew's pulling back a little bit on that he wants to kind of say look what Matthew does is
he re-Judaizes Mark's Gospel in a way brings it back towards the Judaism of Jesus so even though
Mark thinks like even though Matthew's later than Mark it actually in some ways may be a more accurate
sort of general picture of the historical Jesus like a more primitive aspects right exactly not
necessarily more subprimitive traditions but certainly he's trying to pull it back a little
bit so yes we don't have the other side of the conversation in the sense we haven't got any
materials directly from say Peter or from Jesus's brother James but you do have texts like Matthew's
Gospel which seem to be trying to correct a little bit you know and then Luke comes along and of
course he mediates I mean I think Luke knows Matthew Mark so he mediates so we've got Mark and
backbone but then pulling in some of this kind of Jewish Jesus of Matthew and it's Jewish Jesus
and Mark as well don't get me wrong I mean Mark is very clear you know he's not pretending you know
Jesus is a Gentile anything no nonsense like that but yeah he's just leaning in towards the Gentile
mission so much more makes a lot of sense I just recently read Jesus and Paul or Paul and Jesus I'm
sorry by James Tabor right yes you're my friend James Tabor yeah yeah I'm going to be actually
interviewing him sometimes too great very you'll enjoy that yeah he takes a different stance on
James than Dr. Ehrman and he thinks James is it has some of this what we're talking about with Matthew
like yeah well why are you talking about the law yeah this sounds very Jesusy yeah not Paul like
it seems like Jesusy and this friction I love it's it's amazing to hear this tension and I think
you're right like it sounds like this is reflecting an earlier thing but not as popular everything
who wants to circumcise right if you're a pagan right and that brings us to one last question I'd
like to ask you is in this overview that you're taking us this plane that we're flying over the
New Testament there's something strange happening with Gentiles yeah sure we have them like little
here and there's in the Old Testament the Hebrew Bible where you find Ruth you find Esther you find
these like what or even like what's Jonah doing he's running from God and he knows none of us
going to repent if they do God's going to show mercy to these to these non-Israelites well
there are groups that I encounter and sometimes there's even some radical groups like the British
Israelites or Black Hebrew Israelites that are having people kiss their feet in Brooklyn New York
like really extremist groups that tend to say we're the lost Israelites this is going to open
up a can of worms I don't want to open yet like maybe another another video but ultimately
are the Gentiles in the New Testament actual pagans because now we're bringing in Dr. Jason
Staple and this is like a whole another can of worms so maybe just give us a tease on like
what is the gen who are the Gentiles in the New Testament
it's I mean it's it's this is such a fascinating question and to some extent we don't know the
answer because Paul will just use terms like Gentiles which could just I mean what is that
actually what does that actually mean I mean it's even more complicated in the Greek in so far as
the word which we translate Gentiles in Greek is the word ethnos and that basically also means
nation so you can talk about the nation so sometimes when Paul is talking apparently about
Gentiles he might just mean the nations right which is also something you find you know throughout
the Old Testament Hebrew Bible you know so that one's complicated and one of the fascinating
questions as well is where do god fear is fit into this because we know that there were people who
were sympathetic with Judaism but did not fully convert to Judaism and we generally give them
that term god fear is and one great question there is would these people worshiping other gods
did they think that the god of Israel was somehow kind of better than other gods but that
but that were still lots of other gods they may well have done did they avoid having idols in
there in their home I mean that term idols is of course a deeply freighted term I mean I mean
it's a very disparaging term they wouldn't have called them idols you know but but would you know
are these are these people who are sympathetic to Judaism and who may then have been sympathetic
to the early Christian movement did they have what Christians and Jews called idols in their homes
or not so and if one asks the question were there some people who converted to the Jesus movement
completely from you know a pagan again very freighted term background definitely but certainly
would have been yeah yeah I mean we're not just Paul is for example it's not just going to the people
who are hangers on outside of the synagogue you know people standing outside and he's going
tell you what you know let me tell you about you know I can tell you a way into this I can tell
you way into this isn't going to involve you having to be so I don't think that's what's what's
going on really at all and let's face it Paul is meeting who he's meeting when he's going about
his business so yes his networks are sometimes a question of he arrives in a city and he you know
and he will surely be going to synagogue and meeting people but he's also you know doing
whatever his work with his hands is Luke says it was tent making but Paul talks about working with
his hands so is meeting people when he's doing that and I don't think he's discriminating between
those that he might have thought of as being pagans and those he might have thought as being
kind of god-fearing Gentiles it's just talking to any and all of them we have historical evidence
just last point is we have historical evidence by Philo and others of god-fears being not ethnic
Israelites we have no reason to conclude they're ethnically related or no right so I think that
just kind of is something very powerful because there's some people who go full fiction yeah well
according to this story and I can't even begin to elaborate how non-academic this approach really
is but they'll they do that in order to have their theological biases met right yeah and so I just
thought it'd be important to hear you say yeah god-fears aren't ethnic Israelites that we're aware
of in any way so right I mean the what you may well have had in in I mean we haven't got much
evidence for this but what you may well have had in the early Jesus movement are people who you
know we like in our culture to talk about sort of lapsed Catholics for example you know someone
who you know who is born Catholic brought up Catholic but it's no longer going to mass right
or to confession were there equivalent Jewish people in the first century surely surely there
would be people people like that but whether they're attracted to the Jesus movement in big numbers
or not we don't know the Gospels kind of imply that there are people like that on the you know
that Jesus is attracting the marginalized but the difficulty is that when you're doing storytelling
with the Gospels which the Gospels are doing it always makes a much more interesting story
if you're talking about someone from the margins coming in if like you know you don't get stories
about you know kind of somebody who is you know this really faithful Jewish person who who's you
know always going to sin involved always giving always giving you know money away and all this
of it and oh yeah and then you know and then they came and met Jesus and they sat down at dinner I
mean it's just not very interesting story it's much more interesting story if you if you have
a tax collector who who repents you know because he was climbing up a tree and you know and because
he was a bit short I mean it's a much more interesting story right isn't it so the Gospels
attract stories about the marginalized and it's difficult to know whether that's because Jesus
historically was always always always going out to the marginalized or whether it's just because
they're some of the more interesting stories that get told right. Thank you. Appreciate it Dr. Goodecker.
