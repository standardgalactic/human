Alright, question from Marilyn Lingenfelter.
Dr. Price, what do you think of the new classical scholarship?
And number two, is he familiar with the works, or the work, by Roman Piso and Jay Gallus,
Piso Christ, as well as Abelard's Rootlands, the true authorship of the New Testament?
I've read at least one of those, but it has the same problems as I recall that I had with
Joe Atwell's Caesar's Messiah the first time I read it.
It seems to posit a Roman authorship that would just not account for the differences
between the Gospels and the complexity and the art of religious teaching in each Gospel.
It's hard for me to imagine that stemming from just one or two guys, but it was so long
ago I don't really remember much about it beyond that.
And do you have a thought on the new classical scholarship?
I'm not even sure what the reference is to there.
Okay.
Well, Marilyn, maybe you can bring me back.
Yeah, she knows more than I do.
Yeah, it'd be good to get your follow-up on that and be more than happy to come back,
of course, when I visit.
Have Dr. Bob ask anything in more particular in detail there, so thank you.
