Ladies and gentlemen get the book Dr. Joshua Bowen wrote the atheist handbook to the Old
Testament it is extremely full of knowledge and information for anyone as well as join
the patreon there's hundreds of videos that have not released to the internet you can
ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Dr. Joshua Bowen Michael Baca has another question Michael just send the check I'll
see I'll give you my address okay Derek you tempted me with another question for Dr.
Bowen what is the basic relationship between Elohim and Yahweh in the Hebrew Bible why
didn't the biblical authors just settle for one name we kind of touched on this earlier
but for the deity how does Yahweh relate to or have characteristics that are similar
or different to other Near Eastern deities like Bell Assar Marduk etc as well as Egyptian
deities like Seth and Osiris we're getting outside of your will house but we'll go in
your will house you might have a scholar in mind that you think would be interesting
but as well as Egyptian deities like Seth and Osiris are Yahweh's characteristics basically
derived from the common stock of the Near East or are there particular differences again
thanks to you Derek and Dr. Bowen for your insights yeah I've been like incredibly complex
question and one that I don't I don't know that we can really hammer down so probably
the person this I've already forgotten their name the guy that asked the question but Michael
Baca Michael Michael probably wants to read and of course I can't find it as I'm looking
but Ted Lewis's book on the origin and character of God it's that thousand page but it was
recently published like 2020 I think is when it came out and of course I like I know Ted Lewis
he taught me about Hopkins but it's on ancient Israelite religion that's what the whole book's
about so he basically goes through you know I'm gonna just grab it because I think I know
it's I think it's over here let's see let's follow Dr. Josh here I thought it was over here I must
have moved it um maybe it's yeah there it is okay okay so just so uh I kind of have an idea of
again it's the origin and character of God if you can see that wow yeah um but it's like his
magnum opus oh so like that just to read some of the chapter titles ale worship the iconography
of divinity ale the origin of Yahweh the iconography of divinity Yahweh the characterization of the
deity Yahweh the characterization um I said that the deity Yahweh um yeah so basically what it's
doing is it's walking through all the evidence that we have or evidence that we have of Yahweh
where does he come from what are his characteristics from many different angles what do we know about
ale the different names have got there's a whole section on ale Shaddai yellow and all the ale
compound names um this is highly complex is the answer but I think that's a great resource to use
to try to and it's not that it's not like it's a real dense difficult read I I enjoyed going
through it um okay so does does Yahweh how does he compare to Elohim and why don't they use just
one name well they're different sources right these are different um traditions that are bringing
being brought together so one source is using Elohim one source is using Yahweh not always in
every case but you know with some consistency the Hebrew Bible I think is going I think maybe the
more not the more interesting question but a question maybe that's in this vein is how what's
the relationship between ale and Yahweh and I think in the Hebrew Bible they're trying to
syncretize them they're trying to make them the same deity
but I think there are signs in the text that indicate that originally this was this was not
the case right there's the need to syncretize them I think and correct me if I'm wrong just
throwing this out there like not using L in Yahweh but El Shaddai when when that clear passage
your fathers have known me as uh but now you'll know me as yeah yeah I mean this is this is what
they're you know kind of what they're trying to do is bring about this moving toward this
type of monotheism or at least henotheism right um so when you think though about
ale and Yahweh you see it in other passages where uh like numbers 23 and 24 for example with the
Balaam oracles you can see El Yone and Yahweh and I think ale all as distinct entities and
again this sort of betrays I think what represents older Israelite religion
and that later you know writers and editors are trying to sort of work out of the system
and so things the problem is that even basic questions like where does Yahweh come from
what's his origin we don't know um probably comes from the south but you know that there's
some evidence that it's not just from the south or and again he he goes through that in his book
and people like Mark Smith have talked about this sort of thing um and the other thing I guess
to think about of it I think part of the question was what's he like what are his characteristics
like is he just sort of being pulled from other engineers than deities well deities will often
have similar characteristics right so Yahweh is a warrior god it's a warrior deity so you can look
at places like Exodus 15 and the song of the sea and Yahweh is you know the warrior deity that casts
Pharaoh and his army into the sea and it's a victory you know these are these are victory songs song of
the sea and the song of Miriam um so again that's that's an aspect that I think is highlighted in
certain sections of the text but yet the biblical authors are trying to do things that tease out
different characteristics um so it's not it's not so um I don't think it's it has to be a lot more
nuanced uh he's not just I don't think he's just an amalgamation or something I don't think they're
thinking of one or two or three other deities and then creating Yahweh or something this is probably
a real deity that was worshiped um and maybe that was brought by um I don't know pastoral nomads that
you know moved into Israel that moved into the land and sort of joined up with Israel or maybe
they were you know uh people that were um even in Egypt I'd be I wouldn't be surprised if they were
like people that were in Egypt and when they came up uh they brought Yahweh worship with them and
that sort of became a nationalistic thing I don't know but I mean these are like we don't know we
don't know I think that's interesting the way you just phrased that I mean like there's different
ways to postulate the idea that it's possible I mean like we talk about Marduk Marduk's attached to
a particular place that became kind of successful and if we apply what you said to a group of like
slaves or nomads that are like insignificant and they somehow feel significant in light of a situation
that might be the tradition that gets handed down and those priests if I could use the term at the
time or the scribes however you want to put it at the time they kind of like set in set the ball
rolling yeah once the ball is rolling you know you're not going to go back and go okay I mean you
could but it's like saying um the canon of the New Testament many early Christians read a lot of
these pseudographical writings of Jesus as an infant things like that they like eventually they said
okay these are what we're going to stick with and someone finally like said all right here's our
tradition here's what we're going to stick with it's probably a horrible example but my point is
is this god becomes the one that kind of elevates elevates to that status and then becomes the god
that they worship yeah and it becomes the thing and I mean you can see this just I'm not saying
that this is what happened or anything but I mean you can I think Ronald Handel talks about this
sort of thing or you could have um like the the formation of Israel as a people and we're
sort of going off a little bit it's cool but I mean it sort of ties in the formation of the
nation it doesn't have to be this monolithic thing like one thing caused it so you you don't have to
say all right it has to be completely an indigenous group of people that are all the people that
were ended up Israel like we're already in the land it doesn't have to be that it doesn't have to
be everybody was outside and they came in across the Jordan River in Concord it doesn't have to be
that they were all slaves down in Egypt and they all came up it doesn't have to be that you can have
like I think probably if just look at seeing the evidence that I've seen and again not my area of
expertise but I suspect probably what the case will be is that most of what became Israel that we
see in like the Marinette Distilla is these are Canaanites the living in the land probably living
closer to the coast right when you have the sea peoples that come in of course they take over
the coast at least the Philistines do and you know they come into conflict with this people that
flee whatever migrate whatever you want to call it up into the highlands and of course we see this
archaeologically that the highlands populate but that doesn't mean I like I can very easily
be convinced if we saw some evidence of this for example that you know a small handful I even like
five ten I mean I don't know let's say five or ten people escape from Egypt they were this
Semitic slaves down in Egypt and because of the waning power of Egypt over Canaan and down in Egypt
particularly following the sea peoples that they they escape and they're worshiping Yahweh down in
the south they come up and they find their way into Canaan see the tension and they make their
way up into the highlands because they're you know a disenfranchised people and they come
up into the highlands and they say wow you know we we our god brought us out of Egypt our god is
Yahweh and you know they the people that are in the highlands identify because oh we've been Canaanites
that have been under the under the boot essentially of Egypt and that's our deity too you know and
they they syncretize with their deity al whatever and all you know after some time you know this
becomes the national story that the the five or ten people that came up that talked about their
specific escape from slavery in Egypt gets sort of amalgamated with the general slavery that the
people up in Canaan felt so they were all slaves in Egypt and then over time this story develops
into this nationalistic everybody was a slave down in Egypt right that's the hard part is
pilling back the union of legend and finding out what maybe the source is yeah thank you of course
so
so
