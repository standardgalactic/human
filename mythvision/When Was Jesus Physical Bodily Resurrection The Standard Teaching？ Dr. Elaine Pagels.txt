Professor Elaine Pagels, I have a couple questions we might morph into one and it might
be a simple answer and you may not know the answer to and I don't know if anyone really
knows this answer but I wanted your thoughts on and the question is when is the earliest
that people believed Jesus rose physically from the dead and what do you think the original
teaching was so we talked about this already we kind of mentioned that like there's it's
various angles on how to understand this Paul may have been thinking spiritually but when
do you think physical became an idea in the earliest you could go when would you date
that that's a good question we've spoken about the fact that Paul who who's earliest writing
that we have spoke about resurrection as as an experience a visionary experience and and
of the body that rose as different from the body that we have now it could be like a body
out of light he didn't he didn't know he said it was a mystery but as soon as the New Testament
Gospels are written and I'm thinking particularly of the Gospel of Luke and the Gospel of John
maybe that's what 50 60 years after the death of Jesus there are stories that talk about
a resurrection in which you could actually touch Jesus and he he ate food in front of
the disciples to prove he wasn't a ghost because at first they thought he was appearing
to them after they knew he died so there those stories are quite early I mean although what
50 years is that early we don't know how soon such stories circulated or when people spoke
of resurrection what they meant but we know that at least by the time of the writing of Luke
and John there were people who spoke about him being physically present and both Gospels at the
same time tell different stories which speak about him appearing as a visionary presence so I think
that people just said well I don't know it could have been this could have been that and those
writers wanted to say well however it happened the main point is that he was alive it only
becomes a sort of a doctrine of the church about 150 years after that when Tertullian says well
everybody thinks the Spirit is raised I mean that's not a question everybody believes that the flesh
being raised that is something we teach and that's what we mean you have to believe that the body
was raised Tertullian was a Stoic and Stoics were materialist philosophers they they thought
there's no such thing as spirit divorced from materiality so you can't just talk about a spiritual
vision without a body so he said when I think of resurrection I write about on the flesh of
Christ on the body of Christ and I write treatises that say you can't just say resurrection and mean
something that might be imaginary it has to be physical the flesh of Christ the body of Christ
comes out of the grave that becomes doctrine with Tertullian and he was emphatic on that point as
I said that's part of historic conviction thank you
