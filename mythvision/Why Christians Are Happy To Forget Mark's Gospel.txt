Welcome back to MythVision podcast.
I'm your host, Derek Lambert, and my guest today is Dr. James D. Tabor.
Dr. Tabor, welcome back to MythVision.
Good to be with you, Derek.
We're going to talk about this Mark course, right?
Yes, we are.
I hope everybody sees it in the comments.
I have it pinned.
It's down in the description.
It's pinned in the comment section.
You and I recorded a course on Mark, and I can't tell you how many people have probably
never just read Mark for Mark, number one, but also read Mark and actually went through
the whole gospel, right?
Usually, you're at Sunday school or you're at church or you're hearing people and you
well, chapter seven verse such and such, never just read that gospel all the way through.
And you do that.
You, you've spent your entire career in the Mediterranean world.
You've gone over to the Holy Land well over 70, what, 74, 75 times?
Something like that.
Yeah.
A lot.
And we went, speaking of which, you do tours, oh my gosh, there's too much to say.
My wife also told me, why don't you mention this?
And how come you're not mentioning your other YouTube channel that's MythVision Clips?
And I'm like, there's so many things to tell people, so we're going to make it simple.
Sign up for the Mark course.
We're going to do a follow-up webinar for everybody who signs up for the Mark course,
or we're going to do Q&A, probably spend, what, a couple hours, James?
Yeah.
And I think, well, we might even have more than one, but we'll start with one.
I'm thinking toward the end of February, give people a chance to get through the course.
And yeah, I want to open it up to people.
I consider people who pay the money and take the course.
I consider them our students and they deserve input and, you know, I've taught this course
for years, decades in three different universities, Notre Dame, William and Mary, and UNC Charlotte.
And the students get to ask questions.
They have feedback.
They have different approaches, backgrounds, different views.
They don't always agree with me.
So I want it to be that kind of experience, not just, you know, you buy the course, go
online and go, oh, that's what he thinks.
You know, comments on YouTube, as you well know, Derek, I mean, it's not the place to
address the roof.
I mean, there's some good questions on there, but we want to do it personally.
You know, we want to really go into it.
So in depth, I'm showing people what the course actually looks like when they purchase
it.
There are PDFs.
There are maps.
There are downloadable stuff.
You can get it.
It's MP3.
So if you're not wanting to watch, by the way, this isn't 4K.
I've mentioned this before, where you're actually teaching and it's super high quality.
I mean, it really is.
And you're going through the entire gospel.
There are seven lectures, all in 4K.
And if you just want to listen to it in audio, you can go to the bottom.
It's filled with pictures and Ryan did such a fantastic job.
You can actually download the audio version of it.
But I just want to make one remark here that I think is important is this is not like a
credential thing.
These are all just to help further people's educations.
Even though the content you're teaching is stuff that people were really in your courses
at the actual college were taking, so they get the access to it.
But we're very open in saying, like, you're not going to walk away with a PhD from this.
You could be prepared if you ever went to college with this kind of information, you
know?
I have to say that.
It's an undergraduate level.
That's the same kind of level and approach I would use with my college students.
Yeah.
There's lecture two, seven lectures, just so everybody knows.
And I hope people will sign up and check it out.
It's full of information.
Great stuff.
You also have the blog.
Just getting through this here.
You have your blog.
There's so much you do.
Go sign up.
It's free.
He'll email you on updated information.
Dr. Tabor has been doing a lot of work.
I'm looking forward to the apology of video two that's coming out soon.
That's going to be exciting.
And he has a Patreon now.
So what do you have with that?
What are you planning on doing with the Patreon?
Patreon is for supporting the research projects that I do.
If you go to the Patreon, it lists them all out.
Everything from DNA and tombs in Jerusalem, skeletal remains at Masada, all kinds of things
that essentially involve research.
And what it does for the patrons that join is it kind of brings you in on the inside.
As you become partners with me, if we're going to go figure out something or do something,
particularly because a lot of this would be in Israel and Jordan, you get to be participants
in that with special access and information, ability to ask questions.
I can't, I mean, I get a hundred emails a day, frankly, I can't answer them.
But if people are willing to support the research, and I've done research for years
and raised money when I was with the university for projects, then I consider donors as part
of the team, so to speak, right?
So they get to participate in that sense and also access to asking questions.
I don't have all of the wisdom.
People come up with all kinds of things that I learned from, and I've always felt that
about my students.
And I give people credit if I learn from them.
Everybody points something out to me, and I put it in an article, I'll use their names
if they don't mind, you know, and say this was pointed out to me by so and so.
I interview a lot of academics, and there are not many, if I'm being honest, I'm not
naming names, just being honest.
There's not many that I notice with my interactions who constantly change with the flow of information.
Oftentimes, you find it's easy, I was taught this, I got into this pocket, and then they
kind of defend it till they're dead.
You constantly mold and change to new information as new scholarship comes in, and that's something
I really appreciate you.
Last plug, if I may.
And I'm sure my enemies love that, Derek, because they would say, yeah, I finally got
off that position and got closer to the truth, right?
Exactly.
If you want to help support us at MythVision, please do so now.
I'm telling you, I just did a bunch of interviews with Kip Davis, he came here in person, Dennis
McDonnell came here in person, I have so much to edit, I promise you it's coming.
Many of the Patreon members who ask questions, I got their videos in 4K.
I've got so much content coming.
You have programs with me that we did last summer or fall.
I still have a few there, yeah.
You've also got the trip, we're going to produce a whole documentary on the historical
Jesus on the ground, what can we really know?
So yeah, we've got a lot going on already in 2023, including this course.
Yeah, so jump on the bandwagon, come help us out.
It's a little as three a month, $3 a month if you can afford it.
I figure I would go ahead and share that, Dr. Tabor, and let's get our party started.
Son, do you want to know what the truth is?
After this, there's no turning back.
You take the blue pill, and you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to.
You take the red pill, and you stay in Wonderland.
And I show you just how deep the rabbit hole goes.
Remember, all I'm offering is the truth, nothing more.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
First time I launched the new intro so there you go absolutely and you're one of those
scholars in the spacecraft who you know out of the other little I don't know what you'd
call that little incubator that the humans are in a doctor table or just straight into
the question and then we'll get into the super chats in a little bit um wire wire Christians
happy to forget marks gospel I title it this I know it's been a while since it's almost
10 minutes into this video why it's I don't think it's intentional and many don't even
realize it but we've talked about the experience of very sincere devout people wanting to read
the New Testament and how you start with Matthew and then you get to mark and you think it's
kind of like the same thing and it does sort of seen that because 90% of mark is in Matthew
but we'll get to that how is it in Matthew okay then you get to maybe Luke and it also
seems like well I've read all this and again you have 80% of mark is also in Luke so it
becomes the stepchild sort of the marginalized oh I've already read that and I've just noticed
over the years ministers preachers they get up in the pulpit very seldom would they go
to mark if there's a key passage like picking grain on the Sabbath or Jesus teaches in parables
or Peter's confession people for prefer Matthew it's the church's gospel it's the most developed
you might realize it's the only one that uses the word church twice you know so and then
the great commission at the end going to all the world and preach the gospel and baptize
people in the name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost I mean that's the King James Holy Spirit
you can see why it's just regal it's out there and then Luke is more the supposedly the plotting
historian that gives you all the facts that weren't in Matthew well what happened to mark oh well mark
like we have it but it turns out you don't so I don't think it's kind that part is a conscious
but where it gets conscious is if you realize it is the earliest Jesus story it's the first it's
the first time we ever get Paul didn't give us a Jesus story he hardly gives us he's born of a
woman crucified died and buried and raised the third day I just gave you Paul's gospel he says
that's his gospel and he didn't even say born of a woman in first Corinthians 15 so he didn't
give us the Jesus story what is he allude to maybe one or two teachings of Jesus it's more
blessed to give than receive and the thing about divorce maybe a couple more thief in the night
for the return of the Messiah so what's the story is the question when you read Mark and if you
pull it out like this here's what you get these are my notes but this is what you get in the
course you say well I don't need to copy a mark I got it in my Bible but take it out of the Bible
all of a sudden here's the Jesus story emptier head of anything you know so well I want to read
about Bethlehem and the wise man and the angels and the shepherds at the birth of Jesus let's see
no birth of Jesus and Mark oh I love it when they visit the empty tomb and the women come and
Mary Magdalene has her special vision and then Peter and John run to the tomb and later Jesus
appears that day and a week later again and this is just this is it this is the climax of the
gospel of Jesus Christ turned to the last page of this and they fled from the tomb fear and
trembling had come upon them and they said nothing to anyone for they were afraid well clearly
that's not a satisfactory ending so you know people go well maybe the last page was lost and did
you know there are three four actually four endings one of them is so spurious it's only
in late medieval manuscripts like they went forth and preached the glorious gospel east and west
and the Lord blessed them for something like that after it said they said nothing just a probe on the
ending there a mark is it a is it telling to you that there's so many different endings does that
speak volumes in academic circles meaning the fact that there's many different endings that
don't even agree they've made up different endings is that evident to the academics that hold on this
gives weight to the idea that there really wasn't this ending and yeah there's you imagine
ending that they shared in the community not so many different kinds floating around right that's
right the ending was unsatisfactory I think pretty early on but remember mark is being
overwritten by Matthew and Luke's you don't really worry about it see this is partly a mental
thing you said tell me about the birth of Jesus you don't go to mark tell me about the empty tomb
and the appearances of the apostles to the apostles that proves Jesus was raised you don't
go to you don't need to go to mark because you've got all the other stuff in your head but if you
pull this out and read mark as mark you're getting the first story the earliest story now whoever
wrote it and you know that traditionally it's been attributed to John mark who's mentioned in the
book of acts and it's supposed to have to do with Peter and we don't get into that much because I
want you to just I don't think those are likely attributions but let's just say the author of
what we call mark what he does is give you a story that to him is the gospel of Jesus Christ now I
know in verse 1 it says Jesus Christ the Son of God and I would give that a C rating you know I
kind of like the ABCDEF on text of that reading if you look at the manuscripts I think Metzger gives
it a C meaning it's not real strong it probably didn't say the gospel of Jesus Christ the Son
of God it probably just said the gospel of Jesus Christ now if that is the gospel of Jesus Christ
and the author said this is the gospel then what would happen if you just heard that story
and the reason it was forgotten and lost is partly that it's overwritten by these others
but I don't think that these gospel writers like to mark in other words I don't think the person
who wrote Matthew like Mark I'm not going to go so much strong as to say they hated it but if you
push me I might depending on what you mean by hate like loveless definitely loveless yeah but they
did not think it was adequate for their times as they were presenting their version of the gospel
but they needed it desperately because it's the core story it's the only story that we really have
it's the early story of Jesus right so but what they do time after time is they overwrite it and
rewrite it almost like a painting and you come along and start adding things to the master
thinking well I don't like the way this is or that is and I can show you you know we'll talk about
a few of them today time and time again where this happens uh the most controversial if you
just want to jump into one is mark eight the confession of Peter of Jesus as the Christ
well everybody in their head has blessed are you Peter flesh and blood is not revealed as to you
but my father in heaven and I made the astounding statement in the course that it was a false
confession and I did it partly to provoke people to think I do it in my classes but I'm not just
being cute with that right I do think it was a false confession because if you confess someone
is the Messiah but your idea of the Messiah is completely different and even opposite of the
real idea that Jesus had right then your confession is quote false and if you really want to be
you know strong with it it's from Satan and that's what Jesus says he says to Peter when Peter
objects to the suffering servant idea of Messiah and Peter goes and he doesn't just object it says
he rebuked Jesus he took Jesus aside and told him off I mean I think rebuked is a strong word he
rebuked him uh you know I'm not gonna act it for you but I figure he said something like you'll be
Jesus and I'll be Peter I'll say Derek or Jesus what are you talking about no way that is not I said
you're the Messiah we're gonna go to Jerusalem we're gonna take over Herod's temple we're gonna
set up the thrones for that you know and so forth yeah and Jesus just says you know get behind me
Satan now Matthew is the one that has the blessing Mark doesn't have any blessing of Peter in fact
Peter never understands anything in Mark the disciples never understand anything about Jesus
ever the last time we see them is the Garden of Gethsemane and it says they all forsook him and
flood that's it curtain down on the disciples but as we go through you see that there are
other people who did understand and Mark becomes a test for you the reader are you gonna be like
the apostles who miss it are you gonna be on the inside now guess what Luke does with that
same passage he just takes out the whole rebuke of Peter and the thing about get behind me so he
just takes it out this is typical of Luke when Luke doesn't like something he just removes it
rather than rewrite it or overwrite it just don't put it in you know two solutions but
what if you read Mark as Mark chapter 8 then you find that he begins to teach them something
that they didn't get but are you gonna get it as a reader and it's not just like oh yeah okay Jesus
suffers well that's obvious he says that but what does that imply about a lot of other things that
come out as you go on through so we take you through that in the course yeah that oh man I think
it's very valuable to understand Mark as Mark and this is your point in the course and I have never
even when I record it because for those who know I go and I travel I'll visit scholars I do interviews
Paula Fredrickson we didn't do a course but we did interviews and I've been doing courses as well
with these academics in getting front row seat to learning these things from the scholars who are
teaching this in the colleges I'm blown away when I hear it I'm like oh wow I've never done that myself
and I have a different like I have a a real deep appreciation for Mark as Mark and then it really
creates an interesting drama when you go to compare it and then you start going what is going on
here um we had a lot of crap come up in the comment sections I say crap because a lot of it was very
triggered you could see when you made the point that Peter false confession and from Satan and
they are you kidding me no um we're gonna probably dive deeper into that well let's try this one
what about what's the purpose of the parables I learned in Sunday school I grew up as a Christian
oh Jesus taught the parables to help the people understand well I've got my bible right here
let me read you what Jesus says in Mark he says to you has been given the secret of the kingdom
now he's talking to the disciples privately privately now you the reader have to figure out
what the secret is the kingdom is he doesn't say he says I've been given I've given it to you
but he says to to the rest the crowds outside it's in parables that they may indeed see but not
perceive may indeed hear but not understand lest they should turn again and be forgiven
what kind of an image of Jesus is this yeah why are you speaking in parable means a riddle really
I'm giving you a puzzle now as you go through you're going to see four other times Jesus says
do you hear do you see do you understand to the disciples and they don't each time
and he starts rebuking them and it gets so strong that by chapter eight he says
are you ever going to understand anything but as you're reading it you're getting the inside story
of him meeting with them privately and explaining it and they don't get it so do you see where that
puts you the reader this is what mark's doing he's pulling you in very dramatically and you're
going oh they didn't get it and you gotta almost ask but did I get it like right I thought what
they said might have been okay he's the Christ right I mean what was wrong with that so you
began to see more and more of the mystery of it and remember the identity of Jesus is not even
known in mark you talk about overwriting a gospel you're going to write a gospel and people aren't
going to know who he is until the very end that's when it's revealed publicly by a Roman centurion
when he's dead on the cross but if you go to Matthew and look you know who Jesus is from the
first chapter like with the full blown glory hallelujah angel singing at his birth wise men
visiting in Matthew a virgin girl being pregnant without a man I mean man this guy's going to be
something you open up mark I mean think about it yeah my favorite verse in mark is the very
entrance of Jesus it's the introduction of Jesus and those this is Jesus first time he's mentioned
in mark other than the title which I'm not counting in those days Jesus came from Nazareth of
Galilee was baptized by John in the Jordan now see today people read that oh Jesus you mean the main
guy the guy that's gonna do that it doesn't say it just says a guy named Jesus came maybe he's a
minor character how do you know that he's not a minor character in that verse it says John's
baptizing crowds of people and in those days Jesus came as was baptized you say well God announced it
not in mark he did not announce it in mark that's Matthew loud speaker this is my beloved son
if you put that out of mark just say I don't even I mean this is incoherent yeah just to
emphasize the point that you're saying is in mark in the Greek he's talking directly it's almost
like he's whispering it to Jesus I'm not gonna use the word whisper because it doesn't say that the
point is the only person who's hearing Jesus heard you are it's a self revelation right so and it
goes on through like that so throughout the course we point those things out and it puts you the
reader on guard and kind of tests you whether you're going to get it or not and at one point
mark even says let the reader understand so he has you the reader in mind so when you take this
course you're really participating in what mark like to do by the way I insist that everybody
read it before they like it's the first lesson of the course and I think Ryan your wife even put on
the course packet stop do not go further there it is see that stop sign there you yeah don't go
further yeah and a couple people wrote me about that and they they said you know it's really hard to
read uh but I go through it so you know what if you go on YouTube there's a video where a very
wonderful actor reads all of mark for you in just over an hour and you could go on YouTube and just
listen to that some of you I think Derek you're like that you're kind of an audio guy right well
yeah usually I'm doing multiple things yeah so you could uh you know I I don't I want to say
read it I mean you could go to that YouTube video just shut your shut your course packet down
listen for hour and 15 minutes that would really be interesting audibly uh because then you would
go like man what did I just hear did like what's coming through here it'd be very interesting
to see and then we unpack it together so you know whether you want to listen and you can find on the
web lots of readings of the scripture they're all over the place um I'm not real fun to the one on
YouTube because they do sound effects like Jesus has baptized your hair water splashing you know it's
just kind of to me it's kind of corny but uh yeah but some people like it you know yeah um I have
that link just so everybody who's tuning in I have it pinned in the comment section and that is to the
course it is beautiful I mean the quality is really really nice and you own it for life
so family get together friends whatever have them come and join you you could you could
participate wherever sign into your account once you get the course you'll be able to access it
for the rest of your life and be able to have these conversations with people I think there's
so many good things that can come of this course that you did uh James we do have super chats can
we take questions now absolutely that and especially if they've taken the course but even if they
haven't I'll be glad to try to address it and I'll try not to say on every question that's in the
course but you know you did this on our on our tour where I'm and I literally for three days on the
tour didn't look at the guide the the tour guide but you would be on the bus and you'd be like having
the little microphone by the way that's in your tour package tour guide read the read the package
and he'd be looking at me because I'd ask him questions when we're out there that day and he's
like you obviously haven't read it yet so so you need to take the course I promise you um no we'll
be nice to people and you know I mean look I've taught for four decades I knew you can imagine
the thousands and thousands of questions I've gotten from students I'm always kind and understanding
and be glad to entertain these oh so thank you about the sacred gospel mark marsaba well I've
got it we got to do something on this Derek because we keep getting the question this is a
a letter that Morton Smith found in I think in 1957 or eight it marsaba the monastery outside of
Jerusalem in the Wadi Kidron as you go down to the Dead Sea and it does it's it's it's written by
a patristic church father who quotes something called mark that belongs to a Gnostic group called
the carpacrations not to get too detailed but the point is it has quotes of a mark that is not our
Greek mark so he didn't call it secret mark but Morton Smith who discovered it did now since then
the research has taken two directions one direction is people accusing Morton Smith of forging it
that he actually just forged the letter by the patristic father put into the letter these quotes
from a mark that we don't have and it would be of no historical value except it's a forgery I
absolutely do not hold that view I think that view is unsupported I knew Morton Smith he worked with
me closely in my doctoral work spent many many hours with Morton Smith and I was a part of not
the 1950s discovery I was too young for that I would have been 10 years old but to hear it from
him and talk to him and read the correspondence of that time where he's writing people about
finding it and trying to figure it out it reminds me some of that Shapiro scroll where if you have
the letters of the guy who found it you did a program on that with Ross Nichols I know
and you read the letters and the correspondence you see that it's emerging naturally out of a
scholarly process but anyway I think the question that let's see Nounia has it probably has more
to do with what about it and remember it's not claiming to be the original mark what it would
witness to is that there were followers of Jesus who had alternative versions of some of the stories
in mark right so that's a separate question from is it a forgery so if I say no it is not a forgery
Morton Smith did not forge that or does that leave us well it leaves us with a record that this
particular Gnostic group had a version of mark they use that is different from our Greek mark
well that's no different than the gospel of the Hebrews the gospel of the Ebonites and other
fragments of lost gospels fortunately we found the gospel of Thomas but we have at least a dozen
other gospels that are alluded to by some of the ancient Christian writers that we don't have
the full thing right right but I think it's useful but I don't I would not put it back into our Greek
mark I'm not sure that it belongs in the first century Morton Smith was more convinced that it
was and there was a real key to Jesus but you should read it you can read it online it's like
my conversations with Elaine Pagels I think that she and she doesn't she's not dogmatic about this
but her influence with Nagamati and reading all of these other Gnostic type literature she
you can tell in her conversations with me and I've got tons of those interviews on the Patreon
and some are already public where you could see that her work and her influence and what she's done
you could tell the impact of that literature makes her wonder if this secret or these ideas
actually do go back to a guy or the at least an early early early community of Jesus followers
even Paul you know what I mean like so she's yeah we have to wonder that I mean people I tend to think
of something like the Gospel of Thomas which we do have the complete version of Encopctic
discovered in the 1940s in Egypt I tend to think of that as second or third century however
you'll have have you ever interviewed April DeConnick at Rice University you'll have I have not yet
yeah she's one of the experts on the Gospel of Thomas she would argue something similar
even though the Coptic version we have is maybe third century or second century let's say second
century that doesn't mean that the layers of it could not be traced back and she actually thinks
it goes back to the Jerusalem church believe it or not not Paul but James and after all remember
the saying in the Gospel of Thomas when you leave us what shall we do we're going to be orphans
remember and what does he say go to James the just my brother he's going to be in charge
so here's here's a text from the second century that's sending people back to James right and
then we have the secret Gospel of James and we have other apocalypse of James in the Nagamati
so yes I think I certainly entertain this idea but what I'm saying is I would not
print an edition of Mark and add the secret Mark passages inside because that it's coming from
a much later Christian father who claims to have a copy of something which I think he probably did
and he's just taking certain quotes out and saying this is how it's different got it so it's no
different than the Gospel of Hebrews Gospel of the Evianites and some of these others that we
have fragmented pieces of quoted by church fathers and also keep in mind that these church fathers
hate these people and they think they're heretics and they're going to hell and therefore when they
do quote their writings it's not going to be an affable light but I still think it's very valuable
that Professor Smith found this yeah and I do not think it's a forgery now what does it have in it
it does have a young man clothed only in a white robe that's baptized by Jesus
let's see it's very much at the end in the Garden of Gethsemane as I recall right I don't have it
in front of me right now and then a young man appears in Mark in our mark in Greek mark
doesn't say what he has under his robe but it says he's clothed in a white garment so probably
somebody's taking that story trying to embellish it maybe there's been such intrigue about who's that
mysterious young man who ran away in the Garden of Gethsemane and then appears in the tomb at the
end is that the same guy and we talk about that in the Course briefly so I like this one too Max
the Confessor Mark was used as the Ebenite Gospel how did they read Mark 2.7 let me look at 2.7 to get
read it if you don't mind for our audience so that way they hear thank you Max for the Super Chat
and thank you Nunya for the Super Chat I appreciate that okay it has to do with this long story of
healing a paralyzed man in Capernaum which by the way Matthew cuts down to about 10 words
but in Mark it's a long lengthy passage and they let him down the roof and then Jesus
heals him but before he heals him he says my son your sins are forgiven well his enemies then
in verse 7 that's the verse that Max is asking about they say that's blasphemy he's only a man
who can forgive sins but God and then Jesus says kind of like a jokester oh really well in order
that you know that I have authority on earth to forgive sins why don't I do this hey be healed
the guy gets up and walks I think you're actually supposed to chuckle a little not in a classic joke
sense but like wow he showed them didn't he right because they're objecting to a theological point
and saying how could you do that and he goes well why don't I do this then you don't like what I said
what about this and I heal a paralyzed guy and here he is walking and he's perfectly whole
so that's the story now lots of people would say well that can't be Evianite
because who can forgive sins but God means Jesus is God in Mark right right right but Jesus is not
God in Mark and there are quite a few other places where you see that he's not now they do ask constantly
in Mark who then is this just who then is this that he can forgive sin who then is this that he
can calm the storm if you fall for it you'll be one of the dumb readers you know who's saying who
then is this it's the disciple look he just calmed the storm this guy is just God maybe
or the Messiah at least but notice what he says that you may know that the Son of Man has authority
on earth to forgive sins this is a delegated authority so their question according to Mark
is bogus only God can forgive sins but could God give the authority to someone else to forgive
sins through his authority then it would still be God forgiving the sins right so the real question
is would he possibly have the authority to do that you see and if you remember the story of Abraham
and actually there are several stories you've talked about this with a lot of your Hebrew
Bible people but the one about the guy sleeping with his wife Sarah right and he says well
ask him to pray for you that you'll be forgiven because you you know you could be condemned for
going after another man's wife and God could strike you dead well again he's he's a mediator
so is Abraham now God because he's going to pray so I think you have to read it in that
wider context but also be careful when you read Mark because he's setting you up for that
the real question of mark is who then is this okay now right in that same chapter you get more
of a hint now this one will really blow you away I don't want to give the whole course away but
I'll handle it if you keep reading in the same chapter he also says the son of man is Lord of
the Sabbath when he's being criticized about how to keep the Sabbath okay but right before that
and guess what Matthew takes it out get that Matthew takes this out the Sabbath is made for
people not people for the Sabbath therefore the son of man is Lord of the Sabbath now that's a riddle
you know what that really means Derek if he says to the his enemies criticizing him
you know the Sabbath is for people not people for the Sabbath therefore the son of man is
Lord of the Sabbath that's saying people are Lord of the Sabbath human need determines the Sabbath
it's not an authoritative statement of Jesus it's a principle that laws are for people people
aren't for laws you get the difference and how would he use son of man to mean that just like
Daniel seven who introduces the term son of man see everybody forgets that Daniel seven
interprets what son of man means let me go over it with you quickly because Paul when when Mark gets
to this and he's quoting Daniel he says let the reader understand he knows you could miss this
it's in chapter 13 he says let the reader get this you're you're going to mess up on this
the son of man coming in the clouds of heaven you go that's Jesus not in mark it's not Jesus
what does Daniel say in Daniel chapter seven there's a son of man who comes before the clouds
in heaven before the ancient of days right and he's given authority and power and glory
Christian that's Jesus Daniel seven and Daniel ask he's agonizing who is that guy who is that guy
and finally he's told by an angel oh you want to know who that is you want to know who that is
and you know what I'm not even going to tell you Derek go look it up in Daniel seven what does
Daniel's angels say about defining the son of man I've already hinted at it it's basically the
people of God the son of man is the people of God so if Jesus goes to the cross guess what you
know who else has to go and I would even say if Jesus is anointed by the spirit who else has to
be anointed by the spirit so the people of God Israel right everybody's a christ in that sense
the way he means christ if anyone would come after me right what do you have to do so that's
another reason mark is forgotten who's going to do the stuff that mark says to do right I mean
thank you so much so we have a lot of I'm going to try and just keep pushing yeah let's just have a
lot of questions constellation pegasus thank you I plan on getting to class soon also is there any
credibility of jesus going to spain that trip kind of exposes what he was doing and looked like you
failed I don't know if you mean jesus or paul because no he means jesus it's a it's a video that
uh i'm interviewed in it uh sunka jacobo beach he did a video and his secrets of the cross series
I think it was or one of his history channel series and it had jesus going to spain and
what he argues is that the language in mark about the sea of galley and the lake and so forth and I
think mcdonnell talks about this too yes it actually got a validity to it not that he went to spain but
that language is not about a little lake in the galley the original source of all that lake stuff
is on the mediterranean sea and it has to do with the mediterranean sea and what he then argues is
that the garasa or the garrison demoniac as he's called that's actually a place in spain that he
locates and in the video goes to it and talks to people and they go oh yeah we've always known that
we have traditions that jesus came i'm sure they're middle middle ages probably yeah but that's still
cool to find out but it's cool but i'd say you know did jesus go to spain i'm teaching mark so
right you know if you if you take the mark course i'm not going to get into that but i did agree to
appear in the video and he asked me sitting on the shore of the mediterranean pointing behind me
saying you know is it possible jesus went here so all i do in the video is point out that yes indeed
it doesn't say it doesn't say lake it says sea and the way the storms described and also
gadara and where it's located doesn't seem to fit mark so that would then hook into some
of the material that denis has done whether one agrees totally with denis or not and i've got his
book on order and i want to read his latest work on mark that's something that i can't wait to hear
your thoughts on as someone who's i want to hear it that's where that goes now to say did the historical
jesus actually leave you know gallilee and roman judia palestine and go to spain i would say
probably not in that passage like the gerozine demoniac is presented as part of the decapolis
i just stay with mark on that yeah however you got medieval stories of little jesus going to
around spain and up to england because you have to go around spain to get up to england right
because his uncle joseph avera matthew is a ten merchant and that's where you get all that
glaston berry stuff and so forth i get asked this all the time by students what i did for
years was to say and i say this to all of your viewers ask yourself what is the earliest source
we have on that whatever the that is what's the earliest source we have on that and how do we
have it that's very upsetting because i would say the earliest source on a lot of things is
josephus you got to ask the other question and how do you have josephus which you've done shows on
with steve mason and others like well how did josephus get preserved by christians and so forth
and so you always have to ask so remember uh uh dan brown stuff the divincy code they end up in
glaston berry and yeah jesus might have gone here as a kid and plant joseph planted this tree right here
okay that's the local legend what's the earliest record or mary magland's in spain and they found
her tomb and they even did dna on this corpse's air so now we got mary magland's dna and her hair
is red and so forth what's the earliest source time and time again you're not going to get
past the middle ages you're really not so my work has tended to always go with the if possible a
first or second century source once you get into third fourth fifth century so much legend has taken
over that and then if you go to the middle ages forget it you know and so all the people on the
web it's just crazy they'll say well joseph and matthew was married to a woman named so-and-so
and they had three kids and they give their names and everything and you go like what what's the source
on that and you find well it's the chronicle of the medieval writer so-and-so but it disappeared
and we don't really have it or something like that you know yeah the people are quoting this like
it's a historical source so you have to be careful thank you james you know mark is mark so yeah
sages and pages thank for the super chat i've reviewed the jesus dynasty on my channel great job
but james son of alpheus equals james son of clopis could you explain the connection
yeah the uh the idea that i present him to jesus dynasty and uh i've said before on monday
wednesday friday i'm convinced of it on tuesday thursday saturday i'm not sure and on sunday i
flip a coin because a lot of the things we're not sure of but it is the case that calaf in hebrou
the verb calaf comes over into greek as alpheus cal you can hear it calpheus it's got the three
letters of hebrou and so clopis see the k l and the ph calaf clopis calpheus it's all the same name
and it means to replace so i suggested that when joseph died if he had no children of mary
then you would have the laveret marriage and that would be that his brother calaf the replacer
of course that wouldn't be his real name that would be his nickname uh would be you know it'd be
like peter the rock james the replacer meaning it's joseph's brother clopis the replacer who actually
would be the father of those other boys james joseph and simon and jude that's a possible theory
isaman is one of the people that has suggested this and i presented it in the book gave them credit
others credit i'm not totally sure but it does i'll tell you this derek this gets back to mark
if you go to the list of the 12 there four list of the 12 we have one in the book of acts we have
luke matthew and mark each have one but mark is the key list of the 12 because he's first
and i think i've got my bible right open to it here when you list out the 12
and if i ask you name four we'll just just take a minute and i think sages will be interested in
this i ask you um let's name the 12 apostles ready let's go most of my students will get peter
andrew james and john that's just in their head so they're you're going to have three tears of four
ready peter andrew james and john the two brothers sets of brothers that were fishermen
i'll make you fishers of men most people can get those most can't get the next four we're still
not down to the third tier the next four usually somebody will think of was matthew one yeah who
else oh god let's see oh philip philip philip was one and what about uh thomas yeah of course the
doubting thomas and bartholomew orthodias okay i got i've got eight okay now you're in trouble
you gotta give me four more and i'm gonna give you one of them judas is scary because i know
you're gonna get that so now we got three apostles can you without looking tell me the names of the
last three no isn't that funny even derrick lembert does well i don't i'm not well listen to this
james simon and jude the names of the three brothers of jesus right and one of them is called
james son of alpheus you see yeah son of the replacer so it's a possible theory that has been
suggested and um whether it's you know we just how often do i say to you derrick so many things
hang on a thread yeah i know your mythos us would love that yeah damn right it's hanging on a thread
like how do you know jesus is a carpenter well first of all it's not carpenter it's builder
okay he's a builder but how do you know that one verse mark six three one verse but everybody
knows that i've seen it on license plates my boss is a jewish carpenter one verse doesn't mean it
isn't true i actually would tend to kind of go with it it fits in with the context you know
joseph's also called a carpenter and matthew so you know maybe or a builder a tecton but a lot of
times we don't know so you ask so who's a james son of alpius is that jesus brother is that not
jesus brother that joseph have kids with mary uh anyway that's what i can give you are the possibilities
right yeah i appreciate that about you too and you're not dogmatic about it we've done various
discussions like that a more and thank you for the super chat how do you respond to
apologists that say things like well mark had a different theological purpose when it comes to
no angels wise men etc well he certainly had a different theological purpose
and i'm not real fun to the word theology let's just say he had a different story or presentation
of what it means for jesus to be the messiah that's really line one i'm gonna leave off son of god
because that adds more theology to it that i don't think is in the early manuscripts so if i ask mark
what does it mean if i say jesus is the christ the beginning of the gospel of jesus the christ
what a period now i'm gonna tell you to read mark okay so it's a story in terms of let me get
his question exactly right um no angels no wise men and so forth he obviously knows that he knows
the guy is born and he knows that he's reported to have been risen from the dead even by the guy in
the tomb but he makes maybe virgin birth stories haven't even been generated by this time that's a
real possibility right met uh paul says he was born of a woman which is a way of saying he's just a
human being born of a woman is a phrase used in second temple sources to mean a human being
among those born of women meaning not an angel so he he doesn't think he's divine or anything like
that he's born of a woman and uh he's declared to be the son of god by the resurrection according
right right uh by the very idea of resurrection not just his resurrection but that of the whole
group uh romans one four but i think for mark uh i don't think it's part of his story i don't think
he has virgin birth and earthquakes and angels coming and raising the dead i don't think he has
all the matthew mythology blessing peter and he's thinking i'm just gonna leave that out
because that doesn't fit my story that doesn't make sense to me at all the way it always goes
is you have marcus the core and then it gets built up and changed by matthew and luke in different
ways the arrow is always going that way remember that show we did on harmonizing the gospels we
go through many examples of that and so yeah he has a different story which would be a different
theology a different view of jesus years ago kester stendall did a wonderful essay i believe
it was no it wasn't stendall it was how much kester i got my names wrong years ago how much kester
stendall did another thing that that i could talk about but it just popped in my head wrong
so how much kester did this uh trajectory through early christianity it's it's a famous essay
i'm sure you've heard some of your scholars mention it i think i like i think uh actually
trying to think who mentioned it that you interviewed recently
can't remember now for sure but it's somebody that studied at harvard
it's it's called uh trajectory is thoroughly christian so his point was that even in the
early period of the first century this is part of the point we made at the first don't assume
everything was harmonious why would you assume that there are parties and politics within the
jesus movement from day one and these gospels you know your conservative evangelical readers
want to say they're all kind of saying the same thing that is not a careful reading they are not
kind of saying the same thing they're kind of saying many many things that are different
and they have to know it it has to be self-conscious now am i faulting them look why should look if
i'm look why should and i want to promote christianity in the roman world why would i tell you
that the earliest followers the 12 we just named were all dupes and never got anything and utterly
failed and first took jesus well i'm not going to tell you that you see it's motivation i'm not
going to tell you that so i go to look and guess what they all first took him and fled
get behind me satan all these things we've talked about it's not in look my god my god
why have you forsaken me that's not in look they had you say well he has a different purpose yeah
he has a different purpose all right but it's not because he thinks mark's account is wrong
he just doesn't want to put it in here's the strategy of matthew compared to mark compared
to lucrather matthew rewrites it and tries to keep it all but mitigates it you know like
like don't put in the Sabbath was made for man just put in the son of man's lord of the Sabbath
that's the main thing whatever jesus does on the Sabbath shut up it's jesus he can do what he wants
that's matthew now so he leaves it out now luc has no problem with that but he has problems with
other things right like my god my god one of you forsake me so he takes it out so that's the
tendency but again why do you want to read either a mitigated rewritten version of mark
or a version of mark where you take a lot of material out that is real offensive
to other readers and you're not getting the original story then did you know that luc takes
three chapters out of mark started in 645 through 814 he just takes it out in bulk
you're going along and you have one story and then you skip to the next verse and luc and you go
wait what happened to those three chapters and mark well nobody knows because they when they're
reading luc they're not thinking of that now you go back and you come up with all these theories
people come maybe his copy was missing those chapters it's just like ridiculous that no it
wasn't missing those chapters if you look at what's in those chapters it's because the failure of
the disciples gets to such a high pitch that jesus finally just says are you also without
understanding do you have hearts that are heart and he really dresses them down and then he throws
out a parable that mark doesn't even interpret beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the
herodians doesn't even interpret it and i cover that in the course now you the reader have to go like
who what does that mean the leaven of the Pharisees and the herodians i don't know what that is
well math you sure doesn't know what it is and luc just leaves it out entirely
okay so stop scamming man there's so much good stuff that the people real quick before you answer
this i just want to say you can tell that james has really spent a lot of time i mean decades in
this material his his mark course carefully takes you through mark as mark i love that you're jumping
to luke i love that you're jumping to matthew to occasionally john acts whatever but this
paints a completely different picture so sign up for the course again stop scamming man what should
we make of the theology and mark in regard to power leaving jesus when a woman grabs his robe
well this is there there are four heroes or heroines and one hero in mark
um i won't give away the course but one of the heroes is a male and he's toward the end of the
book and he's commended for understanding i'm not going to say what it is and then we also
have these women and the story that you're alluding to the woman that has the hemorrhaging
she touches jesus and he feels power go from him uh she's one of the heroes as these are people that
jesus commends for their faith or for their understanding in the gospel and they're always
unnamed they're completely overlooked and they're four when did i say three women or four they're
four women one is a widow with no money one is this woman another one is a woman that anoints jesus
uh with this perfume and so forth and the other one is a syrophoenician woman so these are like
forget those stories those aren't those aren't important those are actually the main stories
and mark that are important as far as him power leaving him he's got plenty of power i guess and
mark when the holy spirit comes upon him at the baptism and he's told personally
you are my beloved son and you i'm well pleased you know he's given this personal
revelation then the next verse he's filled with the spirit and he's driven by the spirit
and so this is just uh it's kind of like the moses story where a portion of the spirit moses has
can be put on somebody else uh i don't think it is a diminishing if that's what you're kind of thinking
right i guess i guess if i can butt in just to throw my interest in what i think stops gaming man
i feel like we think alike in many of his super chats so right um you find for example in the
miracles of jesus and mark they're really he doesn't get it the first time he's trying to
heal someone and it doesn't completely work the first time he has to spit and mud and get down
right dirty and then it slowly is working rather in the other ones it's well not always though i'd
say right i'm just throwing it out there that maybe that might be why uh i'll tell you why i don't
think that works because okay what i'd say most of them are instant he calms the sea calms the
wind and so forth walks on the water it does everything and actually those attempts with
the blind man are very very important in the course because one is right before the revolution
where you start to see but you don't quite see that's actually you the reader
i'm gonna taber's gonna touch you with the course there do you see yet you go
no i still think he didn't curse peter and he didn't call him satan and i'm not really following
you taber here let me touch you again you see it now oh my goodness i see it i see what you're saying
it's that kind of thing for mark not taber i was just saying taber yeah i get it then after right
after it's the third there's this three things mentioned three times and right after he goes
into jericho and heals a blind man and then the blind man is allowed to confess jesus for the
first time this is okay now you can confess him because you've been healed of blindness
meaning spiritual blindness now don't assume that the disciples have been healed at that point
because they haven't how do i know because when they hear about the widow which is supposed to
make you almost want to cry this woman's sacrificing they go master next verse look at these huge
buildings we're gonna take over pretty soon man i can't wait to get to the kingdom and rule and
reign and power and glory with you that's mark so they don't get it they never get it
hmm you see yeah stops gaming man back again what should we make of mark chapter three claiming
jesus his family thought jesus was out of his mind historically accurate uh first of all
there's some problems with whether it's family or not um it's it's actually
those of his own so it could even be townspeople and it does say that he goes back to the house
and uh i do think there are some inklings here and there and all of the gospel sources that
that jesus biological family didn't go along with him certainly i'm john remember the outright
statement that they didn't believe in him whether this is one of them are not um i'm not sure
but uh whether it's historically right i um think if some of the things that he did could
maybe seem crazy to people you know when you say somebody's out of their mind he's beside them so
uh but because he's particularly dealing with the evil spirits and demons that's the charge in
the context right that well not only he's he's casting these demons out but the way he's acting
could even be demonic himself so maybe he's you know kind of like the prince of demons and that's
why he's hooked up with belzebub or something like that that's the context of the story um
was jesus an exorcist it seems like most of us paulofrigix and elaine pagels you know i'm naming
all your favorite people dale allison barterman i think all of us would agree and i'm happy to put
myself in their company uh they they would all all agree you know we could probably say why
sanders said this i know just naming others that have written about jesus historically
i would think richard carrier might even say it on the days when he thinks jesus existed
that he's probably known as an exorcist and a healer that seems to be almost like bottom line
with people because it's kind of a sociological reaction and people who are different from the
crowd and from the mainstream often would be thought by their friends their townspeople
certainly by their enemies to be kind of deranged right but uh i think that's the context of that
that story thank you not just that the family rejected him but people are thinking he's crazy
because of this demonic thing going on stop scheming mags back again thank you for the support
in mark jesus jesus rebukes people for not implementing brutal old testament laws yet
also has him give the laid-back outlook on the sabbath that it is made for man not vice versa any
thoughts uh the brutal old testament laws would that be like not helping your animal out of the
sabbath and not healing the man with the withered hand maybe he has in mind yeah um i guess you could
call that brutal it certainly doesn't it's not having much compassion for a crippled person right
but remember it's the halakic interpretation of certain groups of jews kumran included
that say you can't help an animal out of the pit they probably also would have objected to the
healing on the sabbath but i think the mark two phrase about laws are for people i'm going to paraphrase
it as the Torah is for people not people for the Torah therefore people are lord of the Torah
uh lord meaning would be the the what contributing authority to decide what is right and wrong in
terms of this law we call it today's situational ethics so i don't really see a conflict there
as much as a consistency that uh you apply the sabbath laws and i'm trying to think if there's
other oh not eating with unwashed hands that's actually not in the Torah is more of a tradition
in mark seven so if he wants to come back and um clarify that we won't charge him over 50 bucks
right uh thank you so much stops gaming man we do have a bunch of super chats and this money's
for derrick by the way i love helping my friend derrick he's it helps me fill a day in the course
yeah yeah and i just i should say it's for myth vision it's to promote all that myth vision
does yeah keep the education going out there let people hear these scholars that are in irie tower
so kevin hogan thank you for the super chat how are mark and marsy and even gallium likely connected
there's no realistic way paul could have known mark or any canonical is there yeah mark is a pretty
common name you think of marcus aurelius mark antony so forth um we've got in the new testament
a john mark in the book of axe mentioned twice peter mentions a mark in timothy which is i say
peter peter mentions a mark in first peter paul mentions a mark i think in second timothy are
these all the same marks you know we can't be sure of that people hear mark and oh there's one mark
and so is the question whether are they likely connected mark and marcian i don't see marcian
directly in mark um i'd have to think about that has somebody argued that that you know of derrick
i would imagine yeah i think there i think if i certainly think mark has some conformity with paul
um in terms of paul saying the main thing about jesus being the christ is suffering and going to
the cross he does say that and he talks about i bear in my body the marks of the lord and i
fill up the sufferings that are lacking in christ and so he's into this mark and jesus suffered
and if i'm gonna follow him i have to suffer you and i did a program yeah that's uh whether he
thought he was the second christ and i think he did and that is a suffering servant him
it's isaia 49 i think isaia 49 paul thinks that's him now in mark i just have to think you know
you're catching me off guard here when i open it and read it marcian doesn't jump out at me
but i can see why marcian might like mark but is this actually saying how how they might have
known each other or something yeah likely connected it could he be baby i think mark is pretty he's
got to be a hundred years earlier or maybe not a hundred but fifty or so because he's so connected
to the 70 ce destruction address him i mean he really is i don't think you can move it much more
than 10 or 20 years it'd be really hard to get up into the second century with marcian
and uh whoever the author is but remember mark why aren't we even saying mark why don't we just
say the author of the second gospel because there's no reason to think that is mark you know you
pick a mark in first peter and you say oh he mentions mark who's with me in babelan oh he's in
rom that's babelan and it must be the guy that wrote the gospel so he's really interpreting peter
that's the reasoning of papias an early church father whom we have mainly in usubias and usubias
says right before that because he doesn't like papias really but he likes that because he needs
to explain this gospel and he goes but papias is not a very smart guy he says that yeah he says
his intelligence is is severely liking wow so anyway it's i would just you know let's let's
let them all be anonymous matthew mark luke and john we got to refer to them they're tax i wish we
could say one two three and four but we never nobody would know we're saying right so thank you so
much that stops gaming man mark says angels attended to jesus win in the wilderness is there
any precedence biblical or extra biblical for such a thing the closest i can think of
is an angel coming to hagar win sent out thank you that's a question yeah that's a good question
trying to think um well there's an appearance to giddy and i don't know if he's in real distress
he he does seem to be in a remote area and he's trying to decide something and this angel comes
i think there are other angelic epiphanies of course to abraham you've got the story of the
three men coming this idea of angels coming and assisting is part of mark's hellenistic world i
think and remember angel throws you off because it's become the wing creatures and you know
christian and jewish mythology and it really just means messengers
so uh i don't mean that they weren't that they weren't from the other side so to speak the so
called spiritual world mark also doesn't he have when he talks about resurrection
what does he say doesn't doesn't he mention that people will be like angels i think he does and mark
that sounds so he believes in angels he believes in demons he's he's fully a first century guy
let me just look that up real quick yeah he says uh for those who rise from the dead they
don't get married or are given in marriage but but are like angels in heaven so you know
mark's fine with angels you know appearing and strengthening him um that might be one of your
parallels that you could go to thank you so much for that constellation pegasus in the house again
judaism says shadeem and angels are two different species was israel so corrupt that jesus didn't
know the difference and angels cannot rebel where are these fallen angels jesus mentioned come from
are you thinking of this belzebub thing or the fallen angels um meeting
i can think of as when in the matter of lightening satan like lightening but i don't know anywhere
no that's not in mark that's not right right oh he's not asking about mark okay he's just saying
generally well let's see i'm trying to think let me go back to the bells of that thing that
would be the main passage he's called the prince of demons the term demon and evil spirit are used
for these beings they're i mean we know throughout this late second temple period they're ubiquitous
and just about every single text whether you're looking at apocryphal texts pseudopigrapha dead
sea scrolls ecephus the idea that these evil spirits or demons their origins are variously
accounted for uh as far as what's being reflected by the author of mark it probably is some pretty
common idea that there are these forces of evil spirits who have a captain
belzebub lord of the flies right who rules uh in that kingdom but he does see it as a kingdom
that needs to be thrown down and it is the key to understanding what is the kingdom of god
because one of the questions is how do you bind the strong man in mark like you got to
bind the strong man how do you bind the strong man that's tricky because the disciples would say
you just crush him what do you mean how do you bind the strong man throw him into the pit of the abyss
and mark has a different answer for that that i'm not going to give you right now
but it's pretty different but it's called the secret of the kingdom there's there's a secret
of the kingdom and mark if you can figure out the secret of the kingdom then you're going to figure
out mark thank you so much um stops gave him in again lots of stops gave him in i appreciate it
just had a thought well we're going to get him on the zoom and just talk forever yeah exactly
well we'll have we'll definitely be doing a follow-up for those who sign up for the course
you'll get the email and stuff at some point we're going to do that just had a thought paul says long
hair on a man it's shameful hegasophus seems to characterize james brother of jesus has a naserite
who would presumably have had long hair does this suggest a rift
um i'm not sure that passage it's in first Corinthians 11 and it's about women's hair and men's
hair and braided hair and shaved hair it's pretty complex i don't think i can address it now i have
written a lot about it the most intriguing thing about it is paul says that women should wear long
hair because of the angels because of the angels and this gets into a kind of legend
that angels look down and you've done a lot on this over the past few months with various
hebrew bible scholars and they lusted after these women and if they have long hair they would be
covered so they're probably looking at their necks or their ears and so in judyism to put
your hair up and braid it and look like a lovely roman woman you probably have pictures of roman
ladies from pompe right it's a it's it's like the evening gown look right even today women put their
hair up and they spend a lot of time on the hair and then they wear the evening gown and you're
showing all of this area and you're basically saying i am a woman and i'm beautiful and here i am
right and the idea of covering all of that maybe with the cloth but i think he's talking about hair
he's saying that men don't need to do that i mean look at derrick right now nobody's listing
after derrick right i could see his neck i'm just kidding i don't know that might be yeah but there's
this idea that uh that in the worship service where spiritual things would be women and men
need to keep their separate roles and it's still true in the mosque today and in orthodox stewart
sonnagots and your wife was pretty freaked out at the wall if you recall yep because the men
are not praying next to the women and i told her and trying to explain it to her yeah ryan if you're
praying next to derrick derrick's not going to be thinking about god he's going to be thinking
about you ryan right a beautiful sweet woman i'm catching a whiff of her perfume and i'm trying to
think of god and here she is maybe coming up against me as we're at the western wall praying
that kind of thing it does you know it's a different question as to whether they should
allow mixing at the wall but yeah the wall it's not a synagogue so but anyway i think it has to
do with that let me look at the question i think the nazarite thing would be completely different
that's a sign of mourning you take off your shoes you don't cut your hair you don't take a bath when
somebody dies it's just like i'm just sitting in the dust and somebody says well don't you want to
eat or don't you want to drink have some alcohol you know get up off put your clothes on get dressed
take a shower it's also headed at your member and when david's child from vashiva dies he won't eat
he won't bathe he's locked in a room for days on end and it's and he won't talk to anybody
that's that mourning idea nazarites something like that but you're set it means to separate
you're separating yourself from normal human activities number one you cannot drink and so
that's going to take you out of bars and all the social world of people so now you're kind of
sitting alone right because you're not drinking you don't even touch grapes just in case they
could be fermented and then you don't go to funerals or what's that what's the thing about a funeral
or there you would be hugging people and joining into normal activities no you don't even do that
and you don't cut your hair you don't attend to your looks you just let your body go doesn't say
don't take a shower thank god but uh it's i think it's the same idea so i think the two ideas are
very very different okay one is about sexual lust and the other is about withdrawal from the culture
i hope thank you sebastian elders thank you for the super chat everyone create your own synopsis
of the of the gospels like i'm doing you'll learn more than ever and you'll lose your mind over how
events and sayings are moved around just don't have an aneurysm when putting them in order
absolutely and i'll tell you what sebastian the other thing you can try remember kermit
xarley me talking about kermit xarley and the gospels in her woven where he puts them all
together you can get it on amazon i actually have my students use it try taking them apart
what i'm going to give sebastian a job put them together you're going to learn you're absolutely
true here's the book you can take either throckmorton which is the three gospels or better this is
very cheap because it's subsidized by the american bio society you got all four gospels in the rsv
look at this there yeah yeah but do it do your own he's right do your own because you know just
looking at it you're not going to learn it but once you do your own sebastian when you're done
go get kermit xarley's book take four colors and try taking them apart again and that will tell you
whether you really know the gospels or not who you will really be amazed because he wants to
put it all in and so what does the voice say at the baptism you're my beloved son
hey this is my beloved son now a lot of people would say that's good that's good
we get both and as i said to you when we did the harmonization thing no you don't get both
where's mark so well it's there no it's not because now when i'm reading the scene i'm not hearing
mark and if he's if you take out my god my god why have you forsaken me and look it's going to be
back in so i'm not hearing look try taking them apart it's fun i actually you know what i give
is my final exam in the gospels course this is really what i give them a photocopy of the arrest
trial and crucifixion of jesus from kermit xarley all together and they have to go in
and color code out the four and they're gonna get it all but you know they pick four colors
and they like it they get to color yeah so they have to figure out just by having studied
now they i tell them beforehand so it's not like a cold you know hit them cold with something like
that but it's amazing how they will study and pretty soon they're like oh boy that's definitely
mark that's definitely mark oh that's luke look what he does father forgive them you start to see
a trend yeah yeah father forgive them they know not what they do you know you happen to know which
one that is there father forgive them for they know not mark mark actually says i thought
i thought that uh when the roman centurion went to luke luke forget oh yeah that's right because
denis said recently in socrates now he connects this to socrates and points out socrates doesn't
blame the guy giving him the hemlock yeah he's saying like so he does do this no mark doesn't
have that though only that's right that's right remember luke forgives everybody in his gospel
right everybody's forgiven and and then what do you preach when you go forth repentance
and forgiveness of sins to all nations so that luke is the forgiveness gospel that's why he puts it
in and he wants the romans to know that jesus even forgave the romans for crucifying him you
know because he's writing clearly for a roman audience that he wants to impress with the stories
of paul and jesus wow thank you so much that this is this is why i hope people will get the course
it is pinned in the chat if you're new into the chat go sign up contextual religion thank you for
the support mark 114 says jesus proclaimed the good news gospel is what he was proclaiming the
salvation from his death i tend to think it's talking about something else like freedom from law or
something okay that's what the course is about you have to figure out line one the beginning of
the gospel of jesus the messiah now i'm gonna tell you the gospel the beginning of it and if jesus
begins preaching the kingdom of god is at hand repent and believe the good news what you have to
figure out is what is the kingdom of god in the preaching of jesus in mark and that's the key
and it's also called the secret of the kingdom and i'm not going to tell you what it is you
do tell in the course but just so people know well i don't know if i tell as much as i get so close
that you'd have to get it yeah i have pretty much tell what i think it is but you're right it's
certainly not talking about believe on me and be saved and then my other favorite passage in mark
good teacher oh i've really gotten knocked in the comments on this one uh good teacher what do i do
what can i do to inherit eternal life right why do you call me good there's none good but god
which matthew completely rewrites several people have said in my comments on my youtube well it's
really the same he's still calling him good well okay let's just mark let's just stay with mark if
you don't mind why do you call me good there's none good but god alone the one god the shema
hero is oh the lord our god is god now why doesn't he say believe on me and be saved from your sins
or even believe on the gospel that i'm bringing you and be saved he doesn't say that he says keep
the commandments then when the guy goes i think i got it then he goes well go sell everything you have
and the guy goes well that's not one of them okay mark is telling you now
what is the secret of the kingdom right nobody's gonna do this derrick i can tell you this it
isn't what you're hearing preached in all these churches i can promise you well i will say this
that the churches that say believe on the lord and you'll be saved romans tan if you confess with
your mouth that he's christ you'll be saved it's not that for sure it stops it of that however
what it calls on you to do nobody's gonna do it yep there are some um nichi said there's only been
one christian and he died on the cross so i like that all these people that say like i'm following
him now i'm not gonna make fun of you evangelical christians i came from that and you came from
that and you couldn't have had anyone more sincere than we were yeah and we did want with all our
hurt and soul to give up everything to sacrifice i mean i remember in college i went to a christian
college people would talk about well maybe i want i won't even maybe i shouldn't even get married i'll
just go do mission work and give everything i mean i i'm gonna admire this not condemn it and make
fun of it i personally you know i'm not on that path of wanting to go to the cross and so forth
but on the other hand i'm teaching early christianity and i think that the writer of mark is very
upset at the glory hallelujah easy path stuff that he's hearing from people that are jumping on the
salvation bandwagon and think that they can recite four spiritual laws and go to heaven when they
didn't die and it takes about five minutes you follow yeah yeah bang the sinner's prayer done
now they would say oh no dr tabor you're we say you have to live a good christian life
good christian life the guy lived a good christian life he says i don't lie i don't steal i don't
commit adultery i'm living a good christian life go sell all you have right i'm sitting in a house
here that i own i have a mercedes it's 25 years old but it's a mercedes not a mercedes i'm sorry
bmw my relatives have a mercedes am i gonna go sell it you know what is that many people say well
it doesn't really mean that uh well mark's living in a time where it might have meant that yeah
especially the apocalyptic oh yeah there's so much so little now whether you can domesticate that and
turn it into a christian message of the church for the ages it seems to me that the church has
done a pretty good job of trying to do that yeah reduce it down to personal salvation
so that when you die you go to heaven and that way you know you're okay so thank you for that
constellation pegasus again did jesus have mental problems how can an anointed one not let people
know he was according to what the jews expected this is uh an interesting question like why did he
not come like what all jews anticipated right like well first of all this is mark's presentation
of jesus so let's keep that in mind and uh it's to go from this to jesus himself and what he might
have thought or wanted is a challenge uh that all of your scholars point out you know how do
you go from the gospel accounts particularly the first one mark back to anything about the
historical jesus we can get a bio maybe going you know he's he's from nazareth of the galley and
he's from the first century and he's an exorcist and a healer and so forth but that's not getting out
what mark really says i actually you know i'm going to give you my opinion constellation i think
this is a literary product primarily how much of it conforms to what if you had a videotape going of
all of these things going back in that day how much it would be like mark i have no idea i would think
maybe not a lot but for mark the author the author of mark sees the challenge of following jesus
as really taking up these hard teachings in a dangerous time but expects a rescue of the
parisia or the coming of the son of man in the clouds of heaven which means what the power and
the glory that they saw at the transfiguration moses will be there elijah will be there everybody
will be raised from the dead they'll be like angels we entered a perfected existence the author
believes all that but he thinks that you're not going to be there unless you start listening
to what jesus taught now i had it so i i think a lot of them like he heals the blind man touches
him twice then touches him once i think those are literary kinds of things um but i i'm not a
mythicist and i do still think there's probably coming through and here i go to paul based on paul
and his teachings and how he knew james and peter and the others a call to uh love your enemies
turn the other cheek face opposition hold on with persecution become a suffering servant you know
which he talks about as well but it's so that when the reward comes and the end comes you'll be
exalted and your enemies will be put down though it's still got a vindication to it for sure
yeah so it's not complete yeah i get what you mean um lady wasser says according to mark jesus
was pi polar thank you so much for that i would be the two paul like thinking love to know more
what she thinks yeah um yet i'm not it or something uh i'm it and i'm not it okay what
do we got here avarice yeah avarice thank you for the super chat mark's secret is jesus as as
daniel nine's messiah not davidic messiah mark 412 is in line with 490 years ultimatum and daniel
nine about the end of temple and law he certainly is deep into daniel nine for sure
um i don't know if daniel nine says anything about davidic or non-davidic
there are messiahs who are not davidic of course but they tend to be priestly in this period
um as far as the term being used it's usually levi and juda those two tribes that are the
tribes that are talked about in terms of anointed ones and thinking of the dead sea scrolls the
new testament um mark 412 let me look at that to be sure i can remember that one
for 12 i'll read it for everybody oh okay about not seeing seeing but not seeing hearing but not
understanding and so forth um i'm not sure the 70 wakes prophecy is what he's referring to it
does talk about a messiah being cut off and having nothing and then another prince coming
nasi it's called anointed prince who's going to destroy the city in the sanctuary it does
sound like two different figures right you're not equating the son of man with jesus in mark
specifically or you're not sure it could be but no it is jesus is the leader of the pack for sure
yeah i mean the the son of man coming on the cloud stuff but that's daniel seven see that's
daniel okay okay this is daniel nine this is the 70 weeks got it got it um it definitely says
destroy the sanctuary in the temple yeah and mark that's where mark says let the reader understand
it has to do with this desolating sacrilegious thing set up where it shouldn't be
presumably a statue like antiochus epiphany set up to Zeus something like that
romans probably did something very similar to that after vespation
hadrium later for sure because there's a temple of jupiter on the temple mount right right so that
would be the desolating sacrilege set up where it ought not to be uh the interesting thing about
that verse that i'm sure everos knows is until desolation is poured out on the desolator meaning
how long we got to go with that till it's over i think mark is living in that period
temple's going to come down or has come down and now we're in that interim period what is the
what is the desolation going to be poured out on the desolator who just desolated the temple
uh wait on god until the word until is pretty big in mark
see the last word in 13 everybody forgets the last word mark 13 the apocalypse watch
watch watch and you dealt with all night and sit at the door with your shotgun
because the thief is coming tonight you just don't know what hour he's coming tonight
that's the image so you're sitting there you got well i'm going to sleep for a couple hours from
two to four no no watch you're on guard duty that's the flavor of mark 13 i don't see how you
could stress that out very long now what is very long five years ten years people start wondering
and then life starts going back to normal and settling down commerce picks up again trade
people have to make a living and suddenly it's like i don't know yeah and then second generation
forget it mom and dad thought this or my grandparents just look at adventists 70 adventists
Mormons do as witnesses those are three indigenous apocalyptic groups in america the major ones
they all had expectations in the 19th century right in the 1800s all failed most of them went
to the early 20th century or in the 21st century now and what do all of them say all of them this
is after 150 years it's near but we just don't know how near but it's near yeah always near
well that's a long night to watch through if it could be like hundreds of years well pretty soon
it's going to be thousand years you're still watching and finally you just allegorize it and
say it already came yeah right full powderism yeah right yeah this is uh something that uh
i'm going to be tackling more on the channel avarose thank you so much for that hnw in um thank
you for the super chat i did not see a question comment just uh oh yeah yeah hnw in because he
joined my patreon today so awesome for yesterday so thank you well they they did ask do you think
just like father gene karma karmic neck former editor-in-chief of the revue de kumran that mark
gospel due to the native semitisms of the text could have originally been written in hebrou
um semitisms uh i think i would go to robert lindsey before i would go with
karmic joc i don't know his work as much but robert lindsey translated it back into hebrou
i think i have a copy right here of that somewhere here anyway and robert lindsey was
head of the well it was an unofficially called the drusum school of gospel research
so a whole lot of students of his are very major students in the field of new testament
studies today they're all over the country and all over the world really and they were
influenced by david flusser at hebrou university so robert lindsey put it back into hebrou and he
was very very competent in hebrou and he said the way it would go back was just unbelievably
easy and that could be the same point that uh the father's making i'm just not familiar with
what he said about it but lindsey was convinced that it did have those semitic roots uh it well
might uh i can't say that my greek is my best language i majored in greek and college in
hebrou i took because you need to take hebrou and i i can work with hebrou pretty well but
i don't think i'm fluent enough in hebrou to be able to say i'm going to put this greek back into
hebrou and to notice the things that lindsey did but he has a whole book on it the gospel mark in
hebrou robert lindsey it's in print i would highly recommend it and see what you think and whether
you know hebrou or not he'll point out a lot of these what it does say though and thank you for
bringing this up because it allows me to make another point this thing of peter in rom and mark
is peter's friend and he's writing down peter's memoirs as best he can remember first of all
that's not very encouraging for an evangelical as best as he can remember well i guess god helped
him that then usubias says but he's not very smart so yeah uh i think many of us are coming closer
and closer to the idea that mark is actually not coming from rom it's coming more from the area of
the holy land and from the eastern mediterranean and of course it does have the aramaic phrases in
it remember when he heals the blind man and so forth or the deaf man rather or even yeah and
why have you forsaken me i was about to say but yeah so um so i i i don't know enough about it to
give a definitive answer on my own authority but i trust that these scholars have uh delved into that
thank you so by the way i don't think fragments of mark were found at comron remember that yeah
that report early on i think that's been pretty well shown not to be the case thank you so much
hang for shy she forgive me i heard a quote from jocephus where he is saying if we face veterans
run away because they will kill you but if they're not vets we stand a chance would love to see this
does this ring a bell thank you he's saying if we face veterans oh must be talking about the jewish
war maybe and if we're facing veteran troops or not i yeah the only thing that comes to mind to me
is that like when you see the armies flee to the mountains that's the only thing that could that would
be in the gossips she says jocephus right that's why i'm i have it not exhaustively
i think there must be something she's heard from jocephus it could well be there and steve would
know right away steve mason uh if you get him on again try to remember to ask him that is there
something about you know veteran legionaries they're different legions right and the tenth legion is
battle hardened and it fought in germany and and elsewhere and when they are sent by
the emperor nero and later titus invest patient and this patient remember is a soldier he becomes
emperor he's a spanish general uh and was very successful in spain and so for it could be something
jocephus where he's saying boy if we you know he surrendered remember he surrendered so uh he's
in commander of the galleon forces and i just don't recall that passage but my guess it would be
on the jewish war if it's there and he's probably just saying yeah i surrender but guess what you
should surrender too because you know what these guys are going to do to you you don't have a chance
in hell of defeating these people these are veteran troops thank you for mentioning that
though i really appreciate because i want to know if that's there i'm gonna go look for it yeah thank
you so much uh soda cabbage thank you for the super chat what is the gospel in the gospel mark
social gospel the poor you have with you always doesn't sound like a social gospel right not a
lot of time left to change the world um i don't think it is the social gospel the ethics of jesus
are given in mark seven and it's a list of 13 attributes that will defile a person
so it's sort of like works of the flesh through to the spirit and poll we name all these horrible
things uh i'll read them to you real quick so that you can check them off and see if you're
righteous or not evil thoughts fornication theft murder adultery coveting wickedness deceit licentiousness
envy slander pride and foolishness all these evil things come from within and they defile a man
uh so this is a breakdown of what's called in Judaism the yet sir hara the tendency to evil
then there's also the tendency to good which would be love joy peace kindness long suffering and so
forth the attributes of god uh is that social well it has a social dimension to it obviously right
because you would want to live next door to somebody that didn't do these 13 things right
you don't want to get murdered or robbed or have your wife or husband taken or whatever
i'm good on that but but i don't see it like matthew 25 i was hungry i was thirsty i was in
prison i was this i was that it's not like that because matthew's living in a different period
and matthew and luke removed the eminence of the apocalypse matthew does it i know you said
we don't want to do matthew but just real quick he had three stories of delay to mark 13 three
stories if i say the last word ready watch the thieves coming tonight but let me tell you three
stories about how it might be longer than that and you don't call that rewriting mark yeah
and people oh you could harmonize that oh yeah you could harmonize it but i would call it a
disharmony it's hurting my ears to hear it harmony means it fits together it does not fit
and what about luke he removes the destruction of 70 from the parisia with the word until until
the times of the gentiles are fulfilled right that could be how many thousands of years from now
and that's what evangelicals say oh yeah it was 67 when the juice you know recaptured Jerusalem
after 2000 years so now the times of the gentiles are over well that would fit luke but luke is not
thinking it's going to come in his lifetime that's why he he thinks the gospel is going to go to the
world and has acts appended to that so right thank you so much captain dad pool in the house
regarding the authorship of the gospels what are dr taber stotz on what is this abumbration
abumbrations in epistolis canonicals on one peter 513 by clement of alexandria
don't know it off and without looking at clement um he would need to say more about it i just don't
know if you know um i would say since it's the mention of peter and mart being associated
and clement i think is one of the ones who's usually named as holding that theory that mark
is a commanding of peter and wrote mark based on the memoirs art no i'm yeah that's right and
then papias is reporting that he heard that through the elder john who heard it through john the apostle
who may need new personally so it's that sort of chain of command i don't have much confidence in
that if that's what he's saying i think that's what he's saying i know he's one of the ones that
is always ticked off as saying mark is the memoirs of peter i have no idea what peter would write
because i don't think he wrote first peter so i don't have a clue what he would write
thank you um just in passing dr kipp davis had a question and said if dr taber has time
can you skim his uh thoughts about mark using jeremiah's self presentation as a marginalized
prophet as a template in his construction of jesus oh absolutely when he clears out the temple
this is jeremiah six and seven if that's what you mean uh joseph is not listening to him
they found the book of the law the temple is a den of robbers it's given over to
sinful behavior and commerce and so forth and you get the idea that it never really
should have even existed in the day that i led you out of egypt i didn't tell you to sacrifice
it's an accommodation second samuels seven you know god says when did i ask for a temple i never
wanted a temple he tells you know david when he wants to build the temple so if that's what kip
means he absolutely is using jeremiah and kip you know jeremiah 15 when i read jeremiah 15 i see
mark's jesus and maybe the historical jesus meditating on that passage i sit alone i don't
sit with the merry makers you know i've set my faces against them and basically i'm in the pit
and there's no salvation and you either come in here and join me or you're part of the crowd or
something of that nature jeremiah is very important thank you for the author of mark and i would say
for jesus too but there i'm making a leap remember what i'm doing is not the historical jesus
but the gospel of mark but it sometimes touches on historical jesus so i see you've got a family
member nodding at you and i just heard her comes on the corner are you on everybody tiptoes on egg
shells when i'm on a live stream and i'm like go ahead go ahead you know just so how many more i
don't want to leave your chats hanging how many yeah so let's blast through these to make sure you
answer them so we don't leave anybody hanging no more super chats go get the course you don't want
to miss it so you can follow dr taber i promise you i hope that people will sign up because we're
going to do a guess you'd say an online q and a like zoom call well we'll have everybody come in
and you know a webinar kind of thing where you webinar yep jc how do you think the synoptic
problem maps out beyond the canon when thomas and other gnostic gospels are included future
show topic these combos love these combos thank you jc yeah absolutely um if you're working
particularly with the two source material that scholars call q you you got to bring in thomas
because a lot of it's there and it's been altered and revised and so forth are changed or updated
or maybe it preserves in earlier form i think the gospel of peter and places maps in to mark
very very well that needs to be in a column i would say that don crossing whether you end up
agreeing with his portrait or not his main book on jesus is it called life of a Mediterranean peasant
is that what he calls it yeah uh he's probably the best on laying all those other sources out
and then showing you exactly how he uses them as he puts everything together and constructs things
however this will surprise you i would also not play down the gospel of john
the way people do in terms of reading mark and john together if you go to my blog
jamestaver.com uh you will and just type in the search feature it's right at the top
right above there see right there type in mark and john and there are a number of posts where i
show you that mark and john and first peter are sources that need to be considered when we're
doing that final those final days of jesus they're very important and i'm not sure what else we
could throw in there but thomas for sure and you know so yeah answers yes thank you so much
appreciate that avarice back again recent scholarship shows gospel of lord underlying luke
is a longer version of mark include includes q with proper ending and beginning in media
res like mark maybe reads like um yeah well certainly look matthew and luke both use mark
story the story of jesus and matthew and the story of jesus and luke are mark's story but clearly
it's drastically edited that's what we've been saying right and uh throughout this uh this
podcast or whatever when i call it this program so yes it is a longer version with q and ending
and beginning at it but it's not just a longer version it's actually shorter because he takes
a lot of mark out it's much shorter and he takes out things like the failure of disciples
like i just mentioned get behind me satan which says peter so it's not really a longer version
it's a heavily edited version of mark but that is his main source um i think luke is very valuable
in my next course i will now announce which derrick doesn't even know
i believe that we can restore the earliest an alternative to mark
and whether mark's earlier or this alternative i think this alternative might be
embedded within the gospels is a proto gospel that i think we can pull out and i have pulled it
out i just haven't published it yet but it's going to be called recovering a lost gospel from our
gospels and it's not just putting together this stuff i like by the way uh because it
doesn't have a lot of mark in it it's it's a different approach but um so we'll wait on that
thank you avarose appreciate that logan fischer is mark 13 to afield prophecy do you see these
great buildings replied jesus no not one stone here will be left on another everyone will be
thrown down it's just kind of pervy it's how people talk all the time i mean i don't know if
the author of mark had been to drislam and seen it or not but clearly to remove all the herodian
stones you'd have to actually almost go below ground but if you go literally not one stone on
another i mean there are plenty of stones around the foundation that are still intact
josephus says that uh this patient ordered the three towers to be left remaining so those are
whole towers that are still there um some people try to get around that by saying well it's the
temple the building itself is gone right however in luke it doesn't just say the temple mark does
but here it says all these wonderful buildings and when you're on the mount of alis where they are
looking out you're seeing all the herodian buildings including parrots palace and that's
what luke also includes i think it's just hyperbole yeah because if you do take it literally
that every stone it but if it is hyperbole but nobody nobody talks everybody speaks like this
if i say you know that house burnt to the ground there's nothing left you go wait i see the chimney
the chimney's still there part of at the top you lied you said it was burnt to the ground the
chimney's not on the ground you lied come on what does it mean it's utterly going to be destroyed
and it was no i don't you know i know people who you've got your bible promoters and your bible
bashers and the bible bashers sometimes need to bash other things than hyperbole because hyperbole
is you know i have heard just to defend this point i think paula frederickson said
when i asked her what did e p sanders because she said i i agreed with e p sanders until i visited
the mount of olives and i think i i don't take me to the bank on this i just i think she said
when she finally witnessed how massive all of it really was she might be thinking no i don't
think the author has ever seen this this compound in the structure and if they did and they saw what
was remaining there's no way they would have made this statement but maybe she's not reading that
part as hyperbole i don't know but i know that you would say while you're saying this is hyperbole
i know that you would agree in saying that doesn't mean mark 13 didn't fail it in the ultimate
conclusion see this is where preterist in us we walk hand in hand but then they want to make the
destruction exactly the second coming and all that nonsense so yeah well it could be that the
author has never been a drusman doesn't know but either way the point of mark is the disciples
missed the point of the widow look at the verse before the verse before mark 1312 they missed the
point of the widow which is the main character in the whole gospel of mark i hate to give the
course away and i won't but she's the main character in the whole gospel okay right okay
then what did they say next word but what about these buildings this is amazing we're going to
take this over that's his point and then he says that's not even going to be left at all he's not
just talking about 70 ad he's talking about the whole disruption of the cosmos when the powers of
heaven are shaken at the parisia the appearance of the son of man which is not just him but all the
forces of the kingdom brought to bear on this wicked world that's his view okay well how many more
you got we got to go a couple more and we're wrapping up tele nikon why is isaias 714 used as
prophecy or proof of prophecy in matthew when his name is clearly yeshua not emmanuel i never
saw the connection now that's kind of a stretch you could say well name can mean fame and description
and he means god with us and so forth but the real problem with isaias 714 is that if you read it
in historical context it's clearly talking about somebody of that period not about anything in the
future and that child is going to be a sign about the assyrians not invading durislam
you got to read it in context what matthew might be doing is saying this is like that just as a
child back then was assigned to the world for salvation from the assyrians jesus is now a sign
of salvation but the problem is it's a young girl having a baby the miracle is not the young
girl having the baby you understand the miracle is before the child is weaned the syrians will be
gone you understand right 714 is just saying a woman's gonna have a baby but before her baby
is weaned and old enough to choose good and evil you know maybe five six seven eight nine 10 11 12
syrians will be gone that's the sign the trial growing up is the sign so matthew is just using it
in a non-contextual way he's taking it out of context thank you so much for that um we did
have a question mat says will mark course by doctor table be available only for a limited time no
it will always be available however signing up now will put you into that that window where we're
gonna actually be doing the webinar so you're gonna want to jump on it now so you can actually
participate in that online webinar uh i'll plan on trying to record that webinar too so people can
watch it later but you can participate with questions fingers crossed we can get to a lot
on so yeah we can't i don't think we're going to keep doing those forever but we want to reward the
people that during the first months or so are the course they went ahead and bought it and that would
be part of a bonus we would give them you know for for being good students of uh doctor table and
mark right so just showing people here make sure you sign up last super chat that i saw i believe
is adam christ christ christing thanks struck by how often mark presents jesus as son of god
beloved son i am when high priest asks demons and centurion affirm it do you think marx jesus
is not claiming divinity the trick is divinity what you mean by divinity and um if you know people
hear trinity when they hear the word divinity mark is clearly presenting jesus as a divine man
and therefore divine meaning an extraordinary person who's imbued with the power of the spirit
in a way that others aren't but what he wants to make clear is that he gets his power and glory
not from that power of god coming upon him but by his suffering and so that's the message of mark
as he goes on through um so it really depends now remember son of god and mark line one it might
be an interpolation by later copious so that would leave you with uh 1462 and the high priest says
are you the messiah right let's see let me just read it uh are you the christ the son of the
blessing okay that's not son of god mark 1462 jesus says i am and you will see the son of man
seated at the right hand of power and coming in the clouds of heaven so he expects the high priest
family at least anus and his sons to live to see this it's this generation in other words right
the centurion that's the big claim but notice he's confessing him dead on the cross rejected and
forsaken by god and humans and his followers and that's the key to mark so he actually touched on
the secret of mark right there so it's almost opposite of what people would think like finally
the glory he's declared as the son of god and you see a dead corpse on a cross and he doesn't appear
resurrected again thank you so much i really appreciate this your time dr tabo just to recap
