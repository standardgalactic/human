Ladies and gentlemen get the book Dr. Joshua Bowen wrote the atheist handbook to the Old
Testament it is extremely full of knowledge and information for anyone as well as join
the patreon there's hundreds of videos that have not released to the internet you can
ask questions and I will record them with these scholars in high definition I do that
all the time you can also personal message me and you help the community grow thanks
a lot Dr. Joshua Bowen something you said in your book and for those who don't know
maybe you can show them the book I should have told you to have it in hand and ready
it's the atheist handbook to the Old Testament and this is volume one you've got a lot more
coming but while I was listening to Seth's angelic or devilish voice depending on if
you're evangelical or if you're an atheist you mentioned in there that Moses is the author
evangelicals typically and orthodox Jews well most of them I'm not going to paint everybody
universally but from what I understand it's kind of like it's it's the protocol you know
Moses wrote the five books except the part where Moses is said Moses died of course they're
willing to grant that but you know they'll say oftentimes when we talk about documentary
and supplementary hypothesis and like you know it's not written by Moses and this and
that their immediate jab is and I'm kind of quoting someone verbatim if you will they
would say why should we listen to critical scholars who can't even agree with each other
so how would you respond to that yeah I mean I'm looking up at this this section right
here of that maybe here over is all penitugal studies and all books on penitugal studies
and it's absolutely true that there's quite a bit of variation among scholars in the field
particularly between like American biblical scholars and European biblical scholars there's
no question that with how it actually came together what the process was there are radical
distinctions and differences between scholars so somebody like Joel Baden as we've talked
about a number of times and as he's talked about a number of times would say there were
four independent sources that were complete and brought together in the final canonical
form whereas somebody like Conrad Schmidt or Thomas Romer or you know any other number
of scholars would say now you know it's it's it's more like you've got major sections that
were layered together and then that had its own theological reworking and layers were added
to that and you know so they had this layering process as opposed to independent sources
brought together so then this charge of well now wait a minute you know these brilliant
critical scholars that you're relying on you know they can't even they can't even agree
on the way that it's supposed to be and I guess I I'm thinking sort of in the moment
here of what kind of an analogy I would draw and it would be something like doctors aren't
entirely clear it doesn't seem on how much coffee you should drink or like how much is
is good to drink for an average person because I saw another article recently it was like
well if you drink like three or four cups it can be good because it can have these benefits
but like you know some would say if you drink five or six that that could be bad and so it doesn't
seem like there's you know complete clarity on that and so different you know different Scott
I mean different scholars different doctors disagree on things like that does that mean that
we should go drink a hundred cups of coffee a day because scholars can't agree or scholars
keep saying it doctors can't agree or researchers can't agree on specifically how many cups we
should take or you know some people some some uh I don't know some doctors would say uh you should
you should do um I don't know eating fewer just overall eat fewer calories each day
some doctors would say well we're more proponents of like doing a uh a like a partial fast or what
do you call that the um intermittent fasting right right well Scott you know like these doctors
they can't even agree on what's the right way to to fat or to diet so I just shouldn't diet at all
like well no that's it's not really how that works right just because they can't agree on the details
of something um doesn't mean that the thing that's motivating them to to try to resolve an issue the
underlying issue isn't a real issue that needs to be resolved uh and the same is true like people are
often overweight and unhealthy so that's the issue that they're trying to resolve
so all right diet this way diet exercise this way whatever um that that doesn't mean that because
they disagree on how one should diet or how one should exercise that you shouldn't exercise
there you shouldn't diet right so um when I think about something like the Pentateuch
and its formation you don't get to say well they can't agree on how it actually was formed
therefore we get to go to our default position which is Moses wrote it it doesn't work that way
and that's why I think it's so important that you know we we take a step back and say what is it
that all these scholars agree on they all agree it's not written by one person they all agree
that multiple hands are involved here they all agree that they're narrative inconsistencies and
contradictions that drive them to try to figure out how did it come together so uh you know while
while an apologist or a fundamentalist or somebody anybody would you know might criticize
critical scholars for saying they can't even agree amongst themselves on how it happened
that's true what they can agree on is in the other direction we're all trying to figure this out
because there's a problem with single authorship it doesn't work um it's just what we we have the
data points right everybody's got these these biblical scholars they had these critical scholars
have the data points all right look narrative inconsistencies contradictions whatever duplicates
doublets those are the data points how do we make them fit and what so often um
sort of fundamentalist or evangelical scholars or or um even many Christian apologists will say is
that they they don't have those data points that they start with is another aren't contradictions
no they're they they they try to um you know either brush over them like we uh like i did to say
well we you know it seems like they're contradictions but we know that god all you know god inspired
most is to write this so we know they aren't deep down contradictions or you have apologists that
will actually try to come up with reconciliations that are kind of weird um but it's not a justifiable
reason to say that because we don't know specifically how this thing was formed or how it came together
that we can't know anything about about it and therefore we have to go back to our default
position that we want which is the moses wrote the whole thing wow yeah i i totally agree with you
if you can't agree amongst yourselves well we're just gonna stay where we're at it's almost like
they require you to know with certainty or else and that's the thing about probability i think
when we're looking at this stuff there's something not comfortable you and me have
talked about this as christians when when we're there there's something comfortable in knowing
yes and just trusting yeah but um now that we're in the kind of uh out there in the land you know
we're kind of looking and exploring you find out more how much you don't know yes and it's kind of
to some people that could be scary especially if you haven't figured that out yet yeah i've kind of
found found relief and like not being certain and just being like okay yeah you know what
why did i have such certainty to begin with yeah and i feel comfort in that so it's nice to be able
to be wrong frankly and and i said this somewhere recently i don't remember where uh that the big
difference i think for me is that there's not i was never waiting or i'm not waiting any longer
for a shoot of fall um like i'm not i'm not afraid of the next archaeological excavation i'm not
afraid of the next paper that's going to come out or the next book that's going to come out
where they're you know presenting data that says oh we found
x evidence for you know this archaeological site or something because i don't have all the answers
and i don't need to i don't i mean it would be nice to have all the answers but that's not
since that's not realistic um i don't expect it and and therefore i anticipate that as i go through
life uh people are going to learn more things and that means i'm going to learn more things
and it doesn't threaten me or my position because it's not a theologically motivated
network uh of of beliefs that need to be maintained and um and when those things change
i don't have to somehow make them fit into my theological system thank you of course
um
