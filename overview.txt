Checking A Fragment： The Pupils, Death, Ancestors, Love.txt
 Darin Stevenson, an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, shares a metaphorical interpretation of how individuals perceive their social environment through the analogy of the eyes and pupils. According to Stevenson, each eye represents two opposing sets of influences in one's life:

- The right eye has the critics at the top (the iris) and supporters at the bottom (the pupil).
- The left eye has lovers and encouragers at the top and detractors or less influential voices at the bottom.

In this metaphor, the pupil is central and represents the individual who navigates through life influenced by these surrounding voices. When open, the pupil takes in everything, reflecting a state of vulnerability and receptiveness to new experiences and knowledge. However, if the influences are overwhelmingly bright or critical, it can lead to feeling shrunken or overwhelmed.

The "donut hole" around the pupil symbolizes the space through which one acts and communicates. This space is crucial for processing information and making decisions, and while one may not be able to see this space directly, an external observer can interpret it as a window into the individual's mind, soul, and potential future actions.

Stevenson's purpose is to explore human cognition and consciousness, aiming to foster new forms of intelligence that are more integrated with technology and society. His ultimate goal is to transform human intelligence and societal structures into more authentic, powerful, and organic expressions than ever before.

Checking Blue 17： Where are qualities？ Superstars..txt
 Darin Stevenson, an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, presents a perspective that challenges the conventional view of qualities as inherent in individuals. Instead, he argues that qualities emerge from the dynamics of relationships and interactions between individuals and their environment. The individual is seen as a "nucleation" point for these qualities, which are not fixed but evolve through relational contexts.

Stevenson reflects on the question of why we do not consistently produce individuals of genius like Albert Einstein, despite having the capacity to do so in the past. He suggests that contemporary cultural pressures and misconceptions about intelligence and sociality have led us to believe that such exceptional talents are rare and individualistic. However, he argues that these talents are actually the result of complex interactions within groups focused on urgent issues or problems. The lack of such urgency and conducive environments in our current society prevents the emergence of new Einsteins.

Furthermore, Stevenson points out that the expectation for external figures like Einstein, spiritual leaders like Osho, or political leaders to deliver exceptionalism has deprived individuals of the necessity to strive towards becoming such figures themselves. This reliance on external superheroes has diminished our potential to collectively achieve greater consciousness, intelligence, and societal transformation.

1. A woman fell from the sky accompanied by geese who did not want her to fall into the water that covered the Earth at the time.
2. The woman landed on the back of a turtle, which was the only land available. The turtle consulted other animals to bring dirt to make the land more comfortable for her. Only the muskrat succeeded and brought back "magic soil."
3. The woman planted seeds that had been in her dress as she fell, which grew into what is now known as Turtle Island (North America).
4. She gave birth to twin boys who later in the womb argued and positioned themselves differently, resulting in the firstborn dying and his death giving rise to the three sisters (squash, beans, and corn).
5. From her heart grew tobacco, which is significant in many indigenous cultures as a means of communication with the spiritual realm.
6. The right-handed son, representing good and truth, created beneficial elements of nature and humanity, such as pollinators and helpful tools or objects.
7. The left-handed son, representing mischief and the negative aspects of life, created predators, mosquitoes, and other bothersome elements that challenge humans.
8. A conflict between the two brothers led to the right-handed brother winning and banishing the left-handed brother to the night sky, where he became the moon, and his body became the fish in the sea.
9. The right-handed brother's mother (represented as grandmother) was placed in the night sky as the moon after her death, while her body became the fish of the sea.
10. Native cultures view the Earth as a living being and consider themselves caretakers rather than owners, emphasizing the need to protect and respect the land.
11. The story is intended to be depicted in a mural that captures the essence of this creation myth, with plans to document and potentially change the story over time to reflect different aspects of the culture and history.

Checking Cypher 3： The Sky, The Garden, The Construct： Portals.txt
1. **The Connection Between Language and Human Anatomy**: Darin Stevenson, an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, draws a parallel between our physical flowers (genitalia) and the English word "flower," suggesting that our language and culture originate from a deeper understanding of these bodily parts. He posits that this relationship is foundational to human culture and knowledge.

2. **The Butterfly Metaphor**: Stevenson uses the metaphor of a butterfly whose potential and capabilities are far beyond what we typically ascribe to our own bodily "flowers." This butterfly-like intelligence within us is capable of flowing between beings and represents the origin of all stories, including science fiction and fantasy.

3. **The Pollen Analogy**: He likens pollen to the essence of this butterfly intelligence, which can transform into a flowing dust and enter any doorway or portal, giving rise to minds and forms of life. This intelligence is what we were truly born to explore and understand.

4. **The Forgotten Truth**: Stevenson notes that cultures have actively worked against this understanding, often poisoning the pollens metaphorically, thus preventing people from recognizing their true nature and potential as intelligent beings.

5. **The Call to Recognition**: He invites us to recognize ourselves as flowers, with the potential to remember and use the portals that lead to our origins and the source of our minds. This realization would provide new insights into human culture and possibly render current stories and books obsolete.

Checking Daemons.txt
1. **The Concept of "Grooves"**: Darin Stevenson talks about how habits and routines become deeply ingrained in our lives, forming what he likens to "grooves" in our psyche. These grooves can be harmful if they lead to negative behaviors or thoughts that we wish to avoid.

2. **Breaking Free from Negative Habits**: Instead of focusing solely on stopping negative habits, Stevenson suggests creating positive alternatives. By engaging in constructive and enjoyable activities when we notice the pull towards these harmful grooves, we can gradually change our patterns of behavior.

3. **Creating New Patterns**: The process involves consciously choosing to do something good for ourselves each time we feel the familiar "gravity" of a negative habit pulling us in. Over time, this practice fills our lives with positive experiences, reducing the power of the old, destructive habits.

4. **Ecological Analogy**: He draws an analogy between the transformation of personal habits and the ecological concept that if an environment is altered, it can lead to a loss of diversity and an overrun by less desirable species or conditions. Conversely, by creating diverse, positive spaces within ourselves, we make it harder for negative patterns to take hold.

5. **Liberation and Freedom**: The ultimate goal is to free ourselves from the constraints of these harmful habits, leading to greater liberation and a more authentic expression of our true selves. This process can lead to significant personal transformation and societal change.

6. **Darin Stevenson's Role**: He sees himself as an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, aiming to explore human cognition, consciousness, and the interplay between language, knowledge, and technology.

1. **The Problem with Declarative Models**: Darin Stevenson discusses the limitations of relying too heavily on declarative models in our cognitive processes. These models often become rigid and defensive, leading to a constant state of reactivity and conflict rather than growth and learning. They consume energy that could be used for positive development and can stifle the emergence of new intelligence and insights.

2. **The Alternative Approach**: Stevenson proposes an alternative approach where we focus on forward-facing roles, acting as conductors of thought and energy rather than prison guards enforcing rigid models. This approach leads to a more dynamic, adaptive, and positive intellectual environment, fostering learning, curiosity, and the ability to integrate and transform even opposing ideas into beneficial insights.

3. **Benefits of Forward Flow**: By adopting this forward-flowing perspective, individuals can experience exciting and positive emotions conducive to learning and deep seeing, much like detectives solving a mystery. This approach not only liberates the individual but also empowers them to assist others in overcoming their own declarative model traps.

4. **Developing New Forms of Intelligence**: Stevenson suggests that with the energy freed from defending declarative models, individuals can develop entirely new aspects of intelligence that have been previously suppressed by these dominant, often harmful habits of thought.

5. **Creating Cultures and Societal Change**: The potential of this approach extends beyond individual transformation. By collaborating and building on each other's insights, individuals can create cultures with a powerful forward-learning momentum capable of addressing global challenges and reshaping societies.

6. **The Vision for the Future**: Stevenson envisions a future where we are no longer victims of history or bound by the limitations of declarative models. Instead, we become the architects of our own intelligence and the shapers of a world that embraces the full potential of human life on Earth.

Checking Edmund Carpenter's： Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me!.txt
 The passage from Edmund Carpenter's "Oh, What a Blow That Phantom Gave Me," specifically from the chapter titled "The Self-Sufficient Image," discusses the evolution of how people, particularly older generations, perceive and interact with images compared to younger individuals. Historically, as literacy became more widespread, there was a strong need among people to validate the images they had seen, such as those in advertisements or posters, by experiencing the real objects or places depicted. This was due to the limited control individuals had over their environment and the novelty of visual imagery in an age of emerging literacy.

Older people often travel with this need in mind, seeking to see and photograph iconic landmarks exactly as they remember from images they have seen before. This reflects a desire to confirm one's identity within a given scene through direct observation. Advertising has historically capitalized on this by creating compelling images that people feel compelled to validate by acquiring the product or experience.

However, younger individuals today are less concerned with this validation process. They often find satisfaction directly from the images themselves, and in some cases, the products advertised may not even exist yet, as consumer interest can precede product development. This dynamic is evident in government (through press leaks) and advertising, where the image or concept can be sufficient without a tangible product.

The speaker, Darin Stevenson, an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, emphasizes that this shift in how we interact with images reflects broader changes in consciousness, our relationship with language and knowledge, and our engagement with technology. Stevenson aims to explore these changes to catalyze new forms of both amechanical human and biological intelligence, ultimately seeking to remake human intelligence and society into more authentic, powerful, and organic forms than ever before imagined.

In summary, the passage highlights the transformation in how images are perceived and the impact of this shift on advertising, consumer behavior, and societal evolution, with an emphasis on the potential for new forms of intelligence and society that emerge from these changes.

Checking Edmund Carpenter： Oh, What a Blow that Phantom Gave Me!.txt
 The passage you've selected from Edmund Carpenter's "Oh What A Blow That Phantom Gave Me" discusses the transformative impact of electricity and media on human consciousness and society. Carpenter argues that electricity has elevated humanity to a state where spirit, or the essence of being, can transcend physical limitations, allowing for instantaneous connection and presence anywhere in the world through media like phones and televisions.

Carpenter uses the concept of neoplatonism to describe this transformation, likening it to the idea of a divine being whose essence is omnipresent yet borderless. He illustrates how technology has shifted our values, accepting the priority of spirit over flesh, as seen when people stop their activities to answer phones or obey commands delivered via recorded messages.

He provides several examples to highlight this shift: a Californian who was ignored when speaking live but captivated an audience with recordings of his poetry; villagers in New Guinea who respect and listen to tape-recorded orders from their leader more than they would in person; and Ojibwa youth who prefer listening to recorded stories of their grandparents over face-to-face interactions.

Carpenter also notes the power of the phone, which can even interrupt intimate moments. He recounts anecdotes where a missing emergency telephone led to concerns about international relations, and how a mad sniper and a bank robber were both distracted by phone calls during their criminal activities.

The chapter also reflects on the cultural shift from valuing real, physical experiences to the desire for mediated ones, as seen in the honeymoon lodge ad that emphasizes the importance of recording and viewing one's own experiences. Carpenter notes how public figures like Mark Twain or film stars are now recognized primarily through their media representations rather than personal encounters.

In summary, Carpenter is exploring the profound changes in human interaction and consciousness brought about by technological advancements in communication and media. He suggests that these changes have led to a redefinition of presence, reality, and even our understanding of ourselves and others. The overarching theme is an examination of how technology has reshaped the human experience, often prioritizing virtual or mediated experiences over direct, physical interactions.

Checking Excerpts from The Meaning of Man (the foundations of the science of knowledge).txt
The passage you've shared is a reflection on the book "The Meaning of Man" by a scholar named Darin Stevenson, who introduces this unique work from Sufi scholars in Fez, Morocco. The book, which was preserved and studied by a select group for over two centuries, is described as profound and clear, offering insights into seeing and being that transcend ordinary everyday experience.

Stevenson emphasizes the importance of understanding opposites and the interconnectedness of all things, as exemplified in a passage from page 83 of the book. This passage illustrates how every positive aspect has its corresponding negative counterpart, and vice versa. For instance, the presence of good is also the presence of evil, the presence of light is also the presence of darkness, and so on. This duality leads to a state of oneness or unity, which is characterized by "annihilation," a term used here to signify absorption into the source or sea of oneness.

Stevenson argues that true knowledge, insight, and understanding are only possible when one can perceive the interplay of opposites without bias or preconceived notions. He suggests that by clearing our minds of pre-existing ideas and culture-specific inclinations, we can achieve a state of emptiness that allows for true learning and authentic human and biological intelligence to emerge.

The goal of Stevenson's work is to catalyze new forms of intelligence that are more organic, authentic, and powerful than current manifestations, aiming to remake human intelligence and society in a more profound and meaningful way. He sees this as a process of uncovering key insights about consciousness, language, knowledge, and technology.

In summary, the passage discusses the philosophical and cognitive approach outlined in "The Meaning of Man," which advocates for an understanding of duality and interconnectedness to achieve higher levels of consciousness and intelligence. Stevenson's intention is to explore and innovate in this space to transform human society and knowledge.

Checking Figuration, Alpha-Thinking, Beta-Thinking and Representational Cognition.txt
🎓 **Summary:**

Darin Stevenson, an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, delves into the concepts presented by Owen Barfield in his work "Saving the Appearances." Barfield's ideas challenge the modern understanding of knowledge and introduce a form of insight that perceives our experiences as representatives of broader universal features. Stevenson emphasizes the distinction between knowledge (as we understand it) and participatory experiences, like dreaming, which are fundamentally different from conscious waking thought.

Stevenson highlights the importance of analogic thinking, which was prevalent in ancient and tribal societies, and contrasts it with the representational logic dominant in modern times. He points out that the Bible's reference to the "tree of knowledge" actually translates to "tree of separating," suggesting a metaphorical rather than a literal interpretation. This reflects a broader pattern of thinking where parts are seen in relation to the whole, as exemplified by the analogy of our hand being to our body as our body is to origin (a concept akin to the divine or source).

Stevenson's work aims to explore and understand human consciousness, our relationship with language, knowledge, and technology, and to inspire new forms of intelligence that are both medicinal and contagious in their impact on society. His ultimate goal is to transform human intelligence and society into more authentic, powerful, and organic forms than previously seen or imagined.

Checking Getting Truth Wrong - And Consequences.txt
1. **The Rossellian Paradox**: A philosophical thought experiment introduced by Bertrand Russell, which involves a self-referential statement that is structurally equivalent to "This statement is false." The paradox illustrates issues with self-reference and truth, and highlights the distinction between statements (which have no mind of their own) and human interpretation.

2. **Insight from the Paradox**: The paradox teaches us that statements do not determine their own truth value; it is the interpreter's mind that assigns truth or falsity to a statement. It also underscores the importance of distinguishing between the facticity (the mere existence) of language and its role in describing reality versus creating it.

3. **The Nature of Truth**: The concept of truth is presented as a concentric circle, with the truth of being at the center, the truth of statements surrounding that, and our interpretations of statements forming the outermost layer. This hierarchy emphasizes that the most significant aspect of language is not its factuality but its potential to provide insights or medicine for the collapse of consciousness and intelligence in modern society.

4. **Enlightenment**: Enlightenment is described as an infinite direction rather than a definitive state or achievement. It involves gaining insight into the nature of awareness, consciousness, and being, which cannot be fully captured by language or validated by others.

Checking Lisance 3： Distance under unity as light⧸time..txt
 The excerpts from Herman Bollandy's "Relativity in Common Sense," published in 1962, offer a thought-provoking perspective on the concept of distance and how it is measured, particularly as understood by physicists versus laypersons. Bollandy illustrates this through the example of radar technology, which allows for the measurement of distances without physical yardsticks by instead using the speed of light and time intervals. He suggests that if humans were accustomed to measuring distances based on time rather than space from an early age, our understanding of distance might be fundamentally different, potentially eliminating the need for separate units of distance altogether.

Bollandy then imagines two alternative civilizations: one that uses the velocity of light as a natural unit of velocity and finds it odd that we use both standard time and standard distance; the other, which treats north-south and east-west directions differently, with one being considered more significant or "holy" than the other. He points out the absurdity of such a system from an outside perspective and how it might seem equally complicated and unnecessary to us.

The key insight Bollandy provides is that our frameworks and metrics can be deeply rooted in historical, cultural, or conceptual preconceptions, which can lead to confusion and unnecessary complexity. He argues that physicists recognize the simplicity of using time as a standard rather than distance, as the velocity of light is defined as a unit of one by definition, making any measurement of its speed superfluous in that context.

**Resuming Conversation**

So hold your thought for just a moment while I check the audio levels and make sure everything is good to go. Okay, we're back. Could you continue from where we left off?

Absolutely, yeah. So beaver bundles kind of the hub of, you know, because the original what matters is the treaty between the living beings here. That is the beaver bundle. And also it's a kind of library of transfers.

So when something profoundly sacred powerful or meaningful is given out or brought in, it's a ceremonial process to transfer that knowledge or power or whatever it is into the bundle.

And so these bundles are like, they're not just static collections of skins and things. They're dynamic. They're alive. They're part of an ongoing conversation between humans and non-humans in a very literal sense.

Exactly. And it's a way of recognizing the agency and intelligence of all beings, not just humans. It's a recognition that animals have their own knowledge and insights and that they can communicate with humans, not just through symbols or objects like the bundles, but also through dreams, visions, and other forms of spiritual experience.

Right. And these experiences are validated by the community through the beaver bundle and other medicine bundles, which helps to integrate them into the broader cultural and spiritual practices. It's a way of maintaining balance and harmony between humans and the natural world.

Yeah, exactly. And it's also a way of preserving knowledge that might otherwise be lost over time as different generations come along. The bundle holds this information, which is why it's so carefully maintained and treated with such reverence within Blackfoot culture.

It's fascinating because it shows a level of ecological consciousness and spiritual understanding that is deeply interconnected with the environment and the community. It's a living tradition that continues to evolve and adapt even as it preserves the core principles and agreements made between humans and non-humans.

1. **Human Similarity and Division**: Darin Stevenson reflects on a story from a Native American bundle, which illustrates fundamental aspects of human nature. Despite the harsh conditions of winter, people must disperse to find resources for survival. This separation leads to emotional distress, particularly among teenagers who struggle with the parting from their younger companions.

2. **The Hoop and Arrow Game**: The story involves a game similar to darts or archery, where a ring is divided into segments, and players attempt to pass an arrow through it. In the story, two boys end up in a dispute over who won the game, which escalates into violence.

3. **The Legacy of Conflict**: The conflict between the boys rekindles an old feud and highlights the way symbolic representations, like the snake boy scout, can perpetuate division among people. The story underscores that at a fundamental level, humans are driven by similar motivations and behaviors but are often divided by cultural or social symbols.

4. **The Owl Child Scout**: The narrative centers around an owl child scout from the opposite camp, who is associated with the snake boy scout. The owl child scout's role in the bundle includes a dance that involves a hoop and a stick (representing the morning star), which reflects themes of victory and the human experience.

3. Through his work, Stevenson seeks to uncover insights that can remake human intelligence and society by creating novel ways of knowing and understanding the world.
4. The conversation with Stevenson touches upon the concept of an agreement within nature, exemplified by the rattlesnake's warning system through its rattles, which serves as a non-lethal way to communicate the potential harm it can inflict if threatened.
5. This agreement, which involves mutual respect and understanding between species, is a key aspect of coexistence and is reflected in the evolutionary traits of organisms, like the rattlesnake's rattles, which are maintained when the agreement is honored.
6. In areas where this agreement is not respected, resulting in the loss of such traits as the rattles in rattlesnakes (due to human actions), it leads to less warning and ultimately, potential harm or even death for humans who cannot see the camouflaged snakes.
7. Stevenson's broader message is about the importance of maintaining agreements with nature to ensure a harmonious coexistence that benefits all forms of intelligence and life.

1. Darin Stevenson, an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, recounts an experience at a museum where he handled a stone pipe that elicited a strong, almost overwhelming physical response from him, followed by intense flu-like symptoms requiring him to rest for an extended period.

2. The artifact was from the Hoopa tribe, located in Northern California's Trinity Valley, known for their distinct cultural practices and ceremonies, despite speaking a different language from neighboring tribes like the Karuk. This illustrates the complexity of the relationship between culture, language, and race, a topic of interest to early anthropologists like Franz Boas.

3. The Hoopa tribe still maintains many aspects of their traditional way of life, including gender roles where men are effeminate and women are butchy, which are integral to their cultural identity.

4. Stevenson emphasizes the importance of preserving indigenous knowledge and practices, noting that while some artifacts and customs may seem lost based on historical comparisons, they remain intact and continue to influence the community significantly.

5. Stevenson's work aims to explore human consciousness, its relationship with language, knowledge, and technology, and to develop new forms of intelligence that are both medicinal and contagious in a positive sense, ultimately aiming to transform human intelligence and society into more authentic, powerful, and organic forms.

In summary, Darin Stevenson's experience with the stone pipe and his ongoing research highlight the profound impact of indigenous cultures on our understanding of consciousness and the potential for new forms of human intelligence that are deeply connected to our cultural and biological roots. His work is about bridging gaps between past and present knowledge to create a future where human society is enhanced by a deeper, more holistic form of intelligence.

Checking Passages from Sufism and Surrealism (Adonis) pp 134-136.txt
 The passage you've shared from "Sufism and Surrealism" by Adonis (Ali Ahmed al-Jaber) delves into the concept of literary expression in Sufi mysticism and its parallels with surrealist art. Adonis discusses how writing in the Sufi tradition is akin to an experience of death—a shedding of the external, social world for the sake of embracing the universal internal reality. This transcendent process requires a language that goes beyond the literal and conventional, one that intoxicates and creates a delirium both in the language itself and in the writer's experience.

Adonis emphasizes that Sufi writers aspire to discover a universal language that captures the essence of infinite meaning and finite image. This language is not bound by reason or conventional logic; it dazzles the reader, transporting them to the infinite. The language of Sufism is metaphorical and figurative, serving as a bridge between the visible and invisible, the known and mysterious. It reveals the unknown through evocative imagery that is neither descriptive nor rhetorical but primordial, bursting forth with the same force as poetic intuition.

In the Sufi experience, poetry is not literary in the conventional sense but an exploration of the essence of man and existence, a transformative process that reshapes both the individual and the world. The imagery in Sufi literature is organic, deeply connected to symbol, myth, and irrational elements like magic, hallucinations, and ecstasy. It is through this continuous discovery and demolition of forms that the true essence of meaning is revealed, with the writer not as the creator but as the creation, thought about and written about by the very meaning they seek to convey.

Darin Stevenson, who you've identified as the author's voice in this context, positions himself as an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, interested in the cognitive evolution of humans and our relationships with language, knowledge, and technology. His goal is to catalyze new forms of human and biological intelligence that are more authentic, powerful, and organic, aiming to remake human consciousness and society.

In summary, Adonis's work highlights the profound connection between Sufi literature, surrealist art, and the transformative power of language that transcends conventional understanding to reach a state of universal truth and inner authenticity. Darin Stevenson extends this exploration into a broader quest for cognitive evolution and the reshaping of human intelligence and society through new forms of knowing.

Checking Passages from Sufism and Surrealism.txt
 The passage from page 130 of "Adonis, Sufism and Surrealism" discusses the distinctive characteristics of Sufi writing and its influence on Arab poetical writing. Here's a summary of the key points:

1. **Beyond Ornamental Language**: Sufi writing views poetry as an expression of consciousness, thought, emotion, and understanding. It is not merely a decorative use of language but a way for humans to feel, think, and relate to the world, thus poetry transcends its form.

2. **Convergence of Emotion and Meaning**: In Sufi writing, poetry is where emotions and meaning meet. This convergence is essential as it allows for a deeper understanding of reality.

3. **Broader Existence**: Sufism posits that external material reality is just one aspect of existence. True understanding requires looking beyond the visible to uncover the internal dynamics of nature, including its roots, sap, and growth.

4. **Truth Beyond Phenomena**: The truth, according to Sufi thought, lies in the mystery within things, not just in their observable aspects. This truth is accessible through a specific kind of knowledge that goes beyond conventional or scientific understanding.

5. **Internal Subjective Dynamics**: Sufism advocates for an exploration of the internal culture—emotions, desires, dreams, and unconscious natural instincts—which is not limited by societal, religious, or political norms. This internal culture requires a language that is effective, obscure, and figurative as opposed to logical, direct, and clear.

Checking Tangent π ： Problems and frameworks.txt
 Darin Stevenson, an intelligence artist and linguistics researcher, presents a perspective on the current state of culture, technology, and human problems. He notes that while technology is increasingly complex and pervasive, it often exacerbates rather than resolves societal issues. Additionally, he observes that people are often caught up in various fictional narratives or ideologies that compete with one another, leading to a fragmented and reactive society.

Stevenson suggests that the underlying theme of many superhero myths reflects a human desire for organized, effective mutual insight and intelligence. In these stories, a group of individuals with unique talents and conflicts comes together to address a significant crisis, which requires them to set aside their differences and work cohesively. This cooperation enables them to regain all degrees of freedom and potential by overcoming distractions and focusing on the root of the problem.

He argues that in real life, we can emulate this model by assembling small, tightly knit groups of experts whose complementary skills can resolve conflicts and address authentic purposes effectively. However, Stevenson points out that society often fails to do this, instead becoming passive recipients of fiction and schemes that limit our potential and freedom.

Stevenson's purpose is to catalyze new forms of human and biological intelligence, aiming to remake human intelligence and society into more authentic, powerful, and organic forms than ever before. He intends to create methods of understanding and knowing that can lead to profound societal transformation and a reimagining of what it means to be intelligent and connected as humans.
