Where are you schooled up?
I'm in the water, it's probably not what you think
Fresh up in the municipality, treatment set into the sink
Are the masters drug, could it be Satan?
If you want that christening, it's gonna come through the blood on the floor
If you're nurturing that logos, I'm with the company
I found the discarded appetite of your baggers
Fresh floors, licking acid in your water
As I stated back up in the business
Teddy babes, the cowdees
For my lady Medea, the queen of Babylon
Something in the drink, and the Greek picnic
Something in the drink
Something in the drink, and the Greek picnic
Something in the drink
Just some lunatic broadcasting from his kitchen
We know that
You guys who are working on the transcripts
Everybody who is involved in the process that the museum is going through
Thank you for your dedication and your hard work
For which you will never be paid a dime
Thank you, thank you very much
It's sacred duty, and we all know it is
So everybody who is involved in the process of bringing these sources
To your brothers and sisters
Thank you very much, thank you
The museum is coming back
Tonight I want to start with something
Just a little light to add just in
By the way, thanks Teddy
Thanks for the tunes, love it
Let's go right in, right in tonight to a little bitty
This is like an appetizer, right?
It's an appetizer
Just wait, just wait, the time machine is working
And when it gets there we'll be ready for the main event
But for now I want to start with something
That I remember telling you
Do you guys remember? Do you guys remember?
They are going to find
One of these types of psychosis inducing drugs
That's being used in antiquity
The archeologists are getting too good
Just wait for it, wait for it, it's coming
Well it came, it came, thank you
Thank you, it's February
Where are we? Chewy
Where are the star charts?
Give us that first one, yep
Oh god, and tonight you're going to have to blow them all up
Oh god, archeologists find evidence of hallucinogenic drug
In ancient Rome, fantastic, fantastic
Congratulations to Elaine
Nice job Elaine, writing this thing up, beautiful
Hit the next one Chewy
What's going to happen here?
What are the archeologists going to tell us?
Oh this is so exciting, this is so exciting
Boom, the scholars make the discoveries
It's a site in the Netherlands
It was inhabited from the 6th century BC
You can forget to eat, none of us care
Through the century seat, what is that?
That's anodomini babies, you know how we do it
We don't use their lingo, they don't like that
But I don't care, when it was under Roman rule
The findings comprise a 90 to 110 anodomini basket
Or fish trap buried face down with the plant
And a polished and hollowed sheep or goat femur
Containing around 1000 black henbane seeds
Hey somebody, somebody stop that guy
He can't do that here right outside the concert
What's he doing with all of those drugs?
This is the jackpot people, this is exactly the drug
That I told you we would see come
To life, the hands of the archeologists
Look at that, that was 100% accuracy
You got to give me that one, oh love it
Now wait, there's a lot more that you and I know
About the drugs, and guess what's going to happen
Yeah, go back to that quote for a second there Chewie
I don't mean to step on your toes here, go ahead
Boom, yes, what can you tell us?
Well there's 1000 black henbane seeds, right?
And it's in this thing, it's in a little carrying case
Isn't that nice, an ancient drug carrying case
Hollowed out femur, that's pretty cool
I wouldn't mind having some bit of antiquity like that
Ooh, can you smell that, can you smell that?
They hate that, they hate that overseas
They hate that on the island
They do, ooh, they're too sophisticated for that
Their scholars wouldn't look into it, so they missed the boat
But we're going to get fortunate and find it
Oh god, I love this stuff, look what else did they say?
What's the next one, she said something else
What's the genius here, there's a professor here
Who is this Dr. Goot, Dr. Goot, Dr. Goot
Nice job, here's what I particularly like about this find
Is the potential link between medicinal knowledge
Described by Roman authors in Roman Italy
And people are actually using the plant
In a small village on the edge of the empire
Right, oh isn't that nice
Noting that although she cannot rule out its consumption
In the Roman period, it is tempting to classify the drug
As a Roman introduction, no, no, no, no
Stop, stop, no, that's not what's going to happen
Now, see it was good Dr. Goot that you found it
That you found it right now
Just wait, just wait, it's coming
Let's show Dr. Goot the drug
Let's bring up the next one please, yeah
Oh, well here, no, this is the one, go there
Dr. Goot, look what I'm going to put up here for you
This is just for you and me, thanks for coming tonight
By the way, Dr. Goot, it's nice to have you here
Look, here's your drug, whooscuamos
Right, and what is the whooscuamos?
It's the cuamos dios, you didn't know that
It's God's drug, you know what that cuamos is
I'm afraid to tell you because you're going to say
That's dirty
Breast buds, the breast bud of the God
Do you know what the breast bud of the God does to you?
You're about to see, ready, watch this
Blow that up, I need to run through this list of names
Look at these people, what do they call this drug?
They call it the Pythonian, right?
Following Pytho, right?
The traditions of the Pythia, what else do they call it?
They call it, oh, I'm introducing you tonight
They call it Adamas, oh, niece Hebrew word
No, no it's not, no, it's not
It's an ancient Greek word that was around a thousand years
Before the dude who created the Septuagint
In the third century BC
Before he wrote his work
So this Adamas, oh, are you beginning to see it?
Satanic congregation, are you beginning to see?
Do you see Adam?
Do you see who he is?
You were told, his name means mud, it doesn't
His name means indestructible, permanent, lasting
Who's going to have to do that?
Ewa, the Ewa's going to do that
She's the one who's got the cup, are you ready?
Are you ready people?
And people are like, what is he saying?
I need some kind of summary, okay, I'm going to try
As your tour guide, everybody off the boat
Off the boat, we're going on the island
2000 years ago, oh, God, you smell that fresh air
Let's go to the next one, oh, don't know, I mean
Keep going, keep going with that one
Look, Dr. Goot, what else are they using, they're calling

Yes, that's exactly where we are
What do they call it?
They call it the hypnotic, the bockock
Oh, here, look, we ended up in a picnic
Is that a goat?
Is that a goat?
I love that, okay
Can we go back to the...
Thanks, okay, there it is
Who else?
Pythagoras, Pythagoras
You mean Pythagoras was using this dope?
Look, people, what I brought you
Look, make love to my words

Ooh, you just discovered Dr. Goot
You just discovered insania
Who wants it?
Okay, we're going to have it
At the end of the service
We're going to have it out
Everybody gets it
Everybody gets it
Isn't this great?
Because where are we?
Where did we come to?
We came to a mystery cult
Right, we're there
We're there, where's Jesus?
Bringing Jesus
Isn't somebody going to
And I'll do a tap dance
While you do that
By the way, hey Jesus
Oh, he's so scary
Why did they paint him like that?
He looks like
Oh, seriously
Have a talk with those
Byzantine artists, man
There's something wrong
Let's go ahead
And we're going to have
Neil come
So let's go ahead and proceed
That's enough song and dance
Get us the next one
Go
Here we are
Back to the text
We've got to go through this quick
One more time up there
One more time
Who else calls it?
What?
The Tuscoy
Who are probably the Tuscans
The people in northern Italy
They have their own word for it
So it's up there
The Egyptians use it
And they have their word for it
Right?
Saffo
Saffo
Isn't that nice?
It kind of sounds like
Saffo
Shut up
Love it
Yeah
And look
The Galloway
And they have it in the Dacians
They have it
Hey, Dr. Goot
The drug that you're looking for
Is all over the place
All over the place
Now that source
Is going to be contemporary
Very conveniently
With your findings
Fantastic
Check it out
Check it out
What's going on?
Love it
Let's go to the next slide
Boom
I want to bring you a text
And look
This is big and delicious
But it's too much
For one person to enjoy
So sit here with me
And let's get together
And have some fun
I'm going to show you something
I say this
And I say this in interviews
And people look at me
And they saw
No
And they're shocked
And they're like
No
And you know
No matter what I say
People always come back to me
And say
You know what
You were right
You were right
And you know
They end up finding a source
Or something
Right
I'm not here to lie
Right
And I'm not making any money
Off of this
Right
You don't have to watch
20 commercials
I don't have to try to sell
You hand soap
Or something
I don't want to
Right
I'm bringing you this
Right
Because that's what the devil said
To do
So look
What is this thing?
It's the toxicon
It's a passage from a Greek physician
A Byzantine physician
And what is he doing?
He's describing different drugs
That are being used
And their cures
And how to treat the symptoms
And he talks about the toxicon
I just want to translate for you
I've never been translated into English
Right
So all of you
Harvard
And all of you
Know-it-alls
Right
Thank you
You know everything
You've never seen this
Right
You've never seen this
This is brand new baby
This is Paul
Paul of Ejina
Show me
Paul of Ejina
Ejina is an island
I love it
So many beautiful islands
We all need to go there
The entire congregation
Will be invited in the future
To a grand celebration in Greece
Time is coming
We will be there
We will be there
Oh, God
I appreciate you, congregation
I appreciate you
And everything that you do
That people don't even see
That's going on
I love it
I love it
This is fantastic
So tell us about this toxicon
Oh, great
Paul, tell us about this
And he says, well, you know
The name of the drug
Seems to come from the fact
That they are Christing
Their arrows in the poison
They're what?
They're Christing them
Look at that second line
Right
Fifth word in
Kriestai
That's what they're doing
Do you understand that Christ
Is a pharmacological term
In antiquity
Jesus didn't pop up
And all of a sudden it was there
Oh, I'm a Christ
What? You're what?
Who's that?
No, it's been around
It's been around since Medea
We all know that
By the way, I went on
Walking dead
No, um, raising
No
Hang on
Oh, my God
Wake the dead
Did you hear that voice?
That was a soft voice
In the distance there
Oh, my God
Wake the dead
Okay, so that was a lot of fun
Thank you
Thank you, Sean
Everybody
Get in there
And love it
I hope you like it
I hope you like it
You're my biggest critics
So thank you
Okay, let's go to the next
Yes, that one
Okay, so tell us about the Toxicon
Tell us about it
Now I'm gonna put these on
Leave them on and read it to you
People are like, hey
What is that guy doing?
Okay, it's called the Toxicon
Because they go ahead and they
Christ their arrows with it
But for those who drink it
Their lips and their tongues swell up
And they get a mania
That is uncontrollable
Where they see all sorts of hallucinations
And on account of this, right
The therapy is impossible
They're impossible to deal with
And rarely can you save somebody
When they've drunk it like this
Oh, my God
And what do you have to do?
Tell me, Doc
What do you do?
Can you feel yourself there, right?
What do you do for this person?
You put chains on them
And you force them to throw up
Using emetics
And he gives a whole list of things
That you're gonna have to force this person
To force this person to drink and vomit
And then there's all sorts of plants
That they want you to give him
To deal with it, to try to counteract
But he says, here's the problem
Here's the problem
This is the beauty at the end of this passage
Right, here's the problem, he says
There are some that escape the danger
Of this drug
And those people, they end up bedridden
And when they can finally get up
There's something wrong with them
For the remaining time
Their remaining time
They are in a state of constant paranoid terror
Oh, my God, seriously
What did you do to them?
What did you do to these people's brains, brah?
What are they doing in antiquity to people's brains?
Holy mackerel
I thought that whole story of that Bronze Age queen
Who was poisoning people
And castrating them
And turning them into sex toys
That she would beat mercilessly
That they were always in a state of total abject servitude
Wow, you can actually make that kind of person?
Yeah, yeah, it's getting deep
It's getting deep
Look, for those of you who have weak stomachs
Now's the time, take out your vomit bags
And we'll make our way into it
Let's get to the next one
I got some chunkiness here, people
I know you'd love it
Where's the chunkiness?
Oh, yeah, bring it in
That's the next one, yeah
Look, for those of you who are in my Greek course
And come to Dojo and work out
Look, you can see hermaphroditus at the top of it
This is on hermaphrodites
He's a doctor, dude
Give him a little credit
And he says, hey, and you know
I had the privilege of sitting down with a student of mine in Greece
Who is also a doctor
And she was able to talk this
Talk me through this
Flash up some diagrams, the development
And what happens?
Oh, boom, bam, bam
There it is, nature all lined out
Hermaphrodite, what happens here?
I want you to just thank for a minute
The conclusion here
At the end, we're going to end up
Performing some surgery
In order to create the best
Of the four different types of genders
That hermaphrodites have
And you're like, what?
What?
Yeah, he says, just wait
And none of that
He says, somebody else is writing about this, right?
Apparently it's common enough
At the time for the doctors around
To be aware of, you know
Hey, there are four types of hermaphrodites, right?
Depending on positioning
The genitalia, and he talks about positioning
And I'm scratching my head, doc
Can you make sense of this?
Right?
Oh, but we end up
We end up doing a little surgery
Isn't that nice?
Artificial insemination
And gender surgery
Did you know they did that in antiquity?
In the society that created calculus
With their words?
Did you know that?
These are the people who said
We go around in the sun
Wow, isn't that amazing?
You'd think they would have been able
To beat that out of people in the Middle Ages
Thank you so much to the people
Thank you so much to the Christians
In the Middle Ages, yes
Oh, he's going to blame Christianity
I'm just blaming the Christians
Who at the time were torturing
And killing people for their beliefs
Right?
To those people who made the Middle Ages
Such a dump
My apologies to medieval historians
But your period is a dump
Yeah, it is
Thank the muse that there was
Some Byzantine scholars
To stand in your way
Oh, God
Where does my allegiance lie?
Lies with the muse in the museum
Love it, let's go to the next one
Or to the Hermaphrodite
Let's just finish off a couple of...
I just wanted you to notice
A couple of things about the Hermaphrodite here
That's all
We have to consider
That of these four types
The genders are going to be determined
Very anatomically and very logically
But we don't have any problem
This is not something that is fatal
Determining gender is a process
That the ancient physician has to be a part of
Isn't that interesting?
Wow, it's gorgeous
But remember, their technology is way beyond
Where you think it was
Their chemical technology is way beyond that
Okay, so let's go to the next one
I want to shock at all people
Boom
Okay, people, look what else I brought
This is just dirty, dirty stuff
Are you ready?
And when I mean dirty
I mean intellectually dirty
Don't be foul, right?
Love it
Take a look at this
What is this?
This is about the numphotomia
What is that?
That's the nymphotomy
Numphae, as we have already seen
As my Greek students know
Is translated as clitoris
What he says here is
Hooper meghethis
What happens?
A hooper meghethis
Numphae genetai
It comes about
This ginormous clitoris
Sometimes is the result
Of the hermaphroditic thing
Boom
And this thing, he says
This clitoris, imagine this
Imagine this
A clitoris that he says
Becomes wrecked
Just like a penis
Fantastic
Can you imagine that?
What a brilliant bit of nature
That's amazing, that's amazing
Fantastic
What it is, there it is for you to see
Right, and remember these hermaphrodites
They are part of the religion
If you cut hermaphroditism
Out of the ancient mystery
It won't stand
You can't have it, sorry
You can't have it
Remember, Aphrodite
The very earliest depictions
Put some Aphrodite up there, please, Chewie
The very earliest depictions of Aphrodite
Are of her with what looks like a penis
And for all of you biologists out there
Who do not have, you know
Who have public decency
You know that the same tissue
That the clitoris is
Becomes the penis, right
The default is the female, right
We were all females, I'm sorry
But at one point we were all females
And then with the testosterone
Hit some of us and screwed things up
Yeah, isn't that funny
We're a degenerate form, biologically
The masculine form is the degenerate
It only makes sense, x, y, y
Point that little chromosome
It's damaged, right
Yeah, don't you love that
So, oh, right, x, x, y
Love it
Let's do, let's go to the
Let's go back to the text
And we don't need to go back to the
What do they do, surgically
They do what they consult
With the parents would be the best thing
Right, he says you're doing it
With the sense of propriety
For the child, right
And so they decide what to do
And in one case it's
When your clitoris is huge
Like a penis
Then they will cut part of it off
And shape it
So that it returns to approximate
You know, an average clitoris
Or as close as they can get
Right, remember they're nipping
And tucking the scrotal tissue as well
Right, these are people who
Just that physician that we were looking at
Paul of vagina, he's known for being
The best guy to repair hernias
Right, so if he knows how to repair hernia
He probably is also repaired
A few scrotal tissue things
And tucked him here
And the perineum is right there
And he mentions the perineum, right
This is where we are
Down zero is the perineum
Okay, okay, fantastic
We're well within, does everybody
See the right going on
Does everybody hear the music, right
See the right, is you sitting on your throne
Oh god, I love this, let's go back
Thank you people for indulging me
And I know Gnostic is there waiting
We're getting close to being done
Go, hit the next one
I want everybody to get all of this
Look people, what is a Christ
It's a medical term, medical term
These are the things that you Christ
For those poisons that you get
From the things that creep around
What we would call reptiles
And also from those poisonous venomous animals
These are the boy themata
These are the things, the cures
That we're going to use, right
These are the, if you want to say
Remedy there, maybe antidote
But it's not quite that last word
Boy themata, that's what the antidote brings you
It brings you assistance
It brings you protection
That is what the author of the Septuagint
Calls Eve
She is that thing for the Adamas
And oh, wait a minute
Wait a minute, was Adamas
Was that the point, was that the point
She had done it with the devil
Right, because we all know
Who's the most handsome, who's the most handsome
Most handsome creature, anywhere
Anywhere, who is it, it's the devil
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So Eve then took it to Adam
And did what she was supposed to have done
But what Yahoo was trying to keep to himself
Isn't that interesting, the devil's like
No, no, no, you won't die, right
You won't die, your eyes will be open
Yeah, and they ended up naked, right
Because that's the way it is
In these rites they're going to end up naked
I'm going to show you a naked grown-up man
With Jesus at the end tonight
Okay, give it, let's, people want it
People want to see Jesus
You want to see Jesus with a naked grown-up man
Who's high on drugs, are you ready
We're going to love it
Go, hit the next one
I just wanted to bombard you with a few of these
Look, Thediyakos, I just want you to notice
About four lines down
We talk about the Fatimaka
That are the Thediyak, right
That are that venom-derived curative
Yeah, venom-derived curative
This stuff's going to heal you, bro
Go to the next one, excellent
And what is this?
This is the Malaktikos
That's in a mall, look, look, look
It's in a malliant
And what is there in parentheses?
Chrismata, Chrismata
This is, again, we're using the same base
But these are all different types of drugs
All different types of drugs
That they're applying a very specific way
Hit the next one
They're talking about these
These go back, way back
You're Hyoschymus
Dr. Goot, you're Hyoschymus
That we're talking about
You're Hinbein, you're Hinbein
Guess what, man
They're talking about that in the Iliad
In the Iliad
It's a Bronze Age fat
Look at the drugs, baby
Follow the drugs
That's the way to go
I love it, I love it
That's what we're doing
Look, people, we can never go wrong
If we just always follow the concrete evidence
In this case, it's the drugs
The drugs cut through all of the BS of the culture
They cut through everything
They get right down to the biological
Oh, God, I love it
Love it, nature, she's gorgeous
Let's go to the next one
And finally, the Sunkrisma
Look, it's so specific
You can make different types of these Christings
Different forms of Christings
I love the iChristing the best
They talk about it in different drugs
You can compose these ointments
And they put them in the eye
Right?
Wait, what?
Didn't Jesus spit in your eyes?
Well, he spit in the dirt first
Then he put that
And then he put that, right?
Spit in my mouth, spit in my mouth, Jesus
Spit in my mouth
It gets my goat
That nobody wants Jesus to spit in their mouth anymore
It really gets my goat
Something is wrong with that
Bring her up
Hello, Penelope
It's good to see you
Oh, I love you so much
I love Penelope
She's my righteous goat, brother
Right?
She's got that mark
Okay, let's go
Let's go to the next one
By the way, Christians
Get your heads tattooed
Right?
It's only 144,000 of you
That are going to escape the wrath
And you've got to have the name on your forehead
That's it
Okay, good
And we showed the beast last week
Wasn't that lovely?
Okay, let's go
What is he talking about?
It's okay, Martha
Go, hit it
Look at this
Oh, Crima, there's one
One more, one more, one more
It's also a Crisma
Right?
An Anguint
An Anguint
Ew, look at that
Look at that
It's all the way down in iamblicus
Right?
He talks about it, too
You mean these?
I thought he was a philosopher
No, he's more like a historian of magic
And the physics of magic
And he's, of course, he's got to be into the drugs
Because everything that they're doing
Is circling the drug, the pill box
Oh, God
You can't get...
This stuff is all over the place, people
They're going to find out in the archaeological dig
Let me tell you what's coming next
It's getting dirty
It's getting dirty
That's what I'll say
Let's go to the next one
We fulfill prophecy
Isn't that nice?
Beholdeth thou me
Periton Alonso and Crisma
Concerning all those other Christing drugs
Oh, nice
Look, you've got entire sections
This is a section title of a medical work
You've got an entire section about Christings
Jesus did not appear on the scene
And walk up and they said, hey, who are you?
And he said, well, I'm Christ
And they were like, huh?
Right?
No
That word had been around for centuries
And people say, now wait, now watch
Behold the lie
And people, this is the one...
Let me just stop for a minute and say
This is the one that's really getting people right now
In these interviews that I'm giving
This is the one that's getting them
Is the fact that the Septuagint's written in the third century
And that it's originally written in Greek
And that your words like Christ
They have nothing to do with Messiah
They have nothing to do with a Messiah
Or anointing
No, they don't
They don't
The Christing is a completely different process
It was the people who wanted to control the narrative
Namely, the Orthodox Jews and the Christians
Right?
Those people needed to create a narrative
And the one that they created is so absurd
That even the Greeks and Romans standing around looking at them
Said, are you joking?
Your narrative is stupid and impossible
Right?
We're historians here
We don't play in fancy and fantasy
What are you talking about?
Oh, God
So, no, it turns out that Christ, that word Christ
Is not
It's got nothing to do with any sort of tradition
Outside of the mystery tradition
Where the Christ is a term that is used
For the dude who is drugged out of his mind
Yeah
Who has that...
What was it?
It was the breast bud of God
And when I say God, I don't mean he
Yeah
Yeah
You know how they get that?
They get that with the venom
They get that with the venom
Well, what do you call her?
Yeah
Oh, isn't that amazing?
Isn't that amazing?
Now you're starting to see Dionysus in a totally different light
You know what I mean?
Oh, God, I love you people
Thank you so much for giving me this time
And Neil, thank you for waiting
I'm almost there
I'm going to fly through a couple more
I want you to see
Oh, I need 10 minutes
Neil, I need 10 minutes
Give me 10 minutes and I'll be there
Get a burrito
Love it
Go to the next source
Look, I'm going to flash through these
I'm going to flash through these
This is Mordyascortes
And here he's talking about the purple
And I just wanted to point out
That it's also talking about treating
And healing
What are considered growths
You can debate about what kind of growths those were
And what they could see
On the surface of the skin and whatnot
But okay, okay
The stuff kills growths
This is the purple
It's here, people
It's a drug
It's an actual drug
John Stuart
Educate yourself, buddy
It's a drug
Fantastic
Go to the next one
Look here at the bottom
I just want you to see here at the bottom
See the pomata
You can also drink the purple
You can drink the purple
If you're little fingers
If you're a 12-year-old girl
Named Mary, mother of God
And your little purple fingers are staying
From the purple that you work with
This is the kind of formulaic knowledge
That you have to have
To be able to stay alive
And by the way
They're going to auction you off
Wait, is this Greek?
No
That part of it is not
They're going to auction her off
To whoever's got the right lot
They're basically going to throw her out there
Why?
Because this is what they do in the temple
It's merchandising
Isn't it funny?
Merchandising creeps into the mystery
And at Jerusalem
It becomes about the sale of the virgin
Wow
Can you believe that?
Do you know what happens
When the mystery is profaned in that way
With cash, with property
With gain of goods and history
Justification for what you do to people
Do you know what that does?
The mystery implodes
To cleanse itself, the mystery implodes
Oh, God
I love that
I love that
Out goes that flame
Can you restart it?
Can you restart it supposedly?
Let's go to the next one
Boom
Finally, I wanted to give you a little bit of this
It's just a little bit of theophrastis
But this is a shout out to everybody
Who's wrapped up in the worship of Sebasius
Those of you out there
And how am I going to
Classify you people
Who follow Sebasius
You have this daisy daimonia
You have this respect
For the daimonis
The powers that be in nature
Do you have respect
For the powers that be?
Ask yourself that
The stuff that you can't see
That makes this universe tick
Do you have respect for that stuff?
I do
I do
And that makes me
A follower of Sebasius
You mean they had a monotheistic thing going on?
So that when people tell you out there
Hey, Judaism was the only monotheistic
No, it wasn't
I just heard somebody say that recently
Somebody from Jerusalem say that
There could be nothing further from the historical truth
Than that
Yeah, love it
Love it
Do you see what we're doing?
We're taking back those texts
We're the museum
It's the text
They can't take the text from us
Love it
Oh, bring up Hermaphrodite
Well, first show us Hermes
Chewie
Bring in Hermes
Everybody
Meet Hermes, please
When Odysseus met him
This is how he met him
He was a little boy
And he came up to Odysseus
And he said, oh, sir
You're gonna need some drugs
And he was like, what's that, drug boy?
And he's like, yeah, yeah, yeah
Take these drugs
And he was like, what's that thing you're carrying?
He's like, oh, that's a stick with snakes on it
Oh, God, I love it
And so
Up comes Moses
Right, up comes Moses
There's Hermes
What happens when you take Hermes
And Aphrodite
Aphrodite, show yourself, please
Let's look at Aphrodite
Thanks to the AI
By the way, the AI can make movies and video games now
Isn't that fantastic?
Oh, God
This is gorgeous
Who wouldn't want to live in 2024?
It's crazy, man
Bring us up Aphrodite
The, yeah
No, you can't
Did we leave Aphrodite somewhere?
Oh, she's in the videos
We put her in the videos
Anywho, when you take Hermes and Aphrodite
Then you get Hermaphroditis
Hermaphroditis, welcome
Welcome, yes, right
Okay, okay
Does anybody have a problem with Hermaphroditis?
I don't
I don't
You know who his best friend is, right?
Eros
Eros
Oh, love it
They're always together, man
They're always together
You know what they do?
They drink
And they play drinking games all the time
You mean
You mean
The founders of democracy
Thought it was okay
For two underage boys
To be getting drunk together
Playful
Yeah, no, that was
That was, you know, it was okay
It's mental health, people
Right, what's in those drinks that they're drinking?
Oh, God, love it
Next one down
Next one down
We gotta go to the next
We gotta fly here
Oh, I'm so behind
Okay, I'm just gonna jump
Look, it's the dip sauce
Here's the snake venom we were talking about
You're welcome to see it later
Go to the next one, Chewie
Go to the next one
I'm just letting people see
Because people inevitably ask me
Or they make snide comments
You know, on the channel here
And they say
Where is your sources?
Right here
Here they are
Can you even read them?
You can't even read them
Go to the next one
Love it
Love it
I'll take that little stand here
With a samurai
I'll cut you in half
We're gonna end with a passage
Of Jesus
I told you we were being Jesus
I hope Neo's paying attention
Because this is Jesus
With a naked grown man
Who is drugged out of his mind
And he's homeless
Right?
Let's see what happens
And so they're coming
Jesus is coming off the boat
And right away this dude
Runs up to him
Right from the tombs
And he's a man who is
Look at the last three words
In Pneumatic
Acathartoi
He is a man who is in
A spirit that is acathartic
What is that acathartic?
That is the unclean
Wait, what?
Well, that's how we translate it
That's not really what the Greeks said
Right?
They said that was the
Before the medical purge
Right?
If you want to get those demons
Out of your head
You're gonna have to be purged
And we're not gonna go
The direction that you think
We're not going to a party
Right?
We're gonna go somewhere
Where I gotta tie you down
I gotta tie you down
And drug you
And I'm gonna pump some stuff
Into you
In ways that you may
Or may not enjoy
But you're not gonna have a choice
And then you're gonna see me transform
And I'm gonna send you to hell
I'm gonna send you to hell
And I'm gonna bring you back
And when you come back
As soon as you come out of that water
And suck that air
You're gonna be as thankful as anybody
You're gonna have seen the shit
And now you're gonna know what's beyond
That's what I can promise you
Who's first?
Who's first?
You ready for the purge?
Are you ready?
Is this the stuff that we should be afraid of?
Remember, the Christians are doing this
Yeah, it's the magic, baby
It's the magic
And we can trace it with those drugs
They just found a whole dump of this stuff
Some lunatic was carrying around it
A container of it
Beautiful container of it
Oh, God, you know what those seeds do?
They don't call it mania for no reason
The Romans don't walk around saying
Hey, watch out for that insanity
They don't do that just for kicks
Sometimes it's necessary to go there
Welcome, let's go last
I think it's the last boom
Oh, here's Jesus
Anyway, hit the next
Here's Jesus and he says
Look, this guy had his home in the cemetery
And nobody was able to chain him up
Nobody was able to
Why? Because every time they did
Every time they did, he'd break out
They even put hand braces on him
And shackles on his feet
And he still was able to get free
This guy can't be treated, brah
He's outside and he's naked
He's naked, I promise you he's naked
Go to the next one
Jesus is like, hey, you know what I mean?
Day and night, this guy has been in the tombs
Oh, by the way, what's he doing?
What's this naked, full grown man
Doing and living in a cemetery
What's he fine to do that's fun
If he had some kind of page on some dating service
What would he put, things he likes to do?
Let's see, what's this man?
He goes around the tombs and around the hills
And the tops of the mountains
He runs around the mountains doing crazy stuff
What kind of crazy stuff does he do?
Oh, he vocalizes
He vocalizes, yeah, well, you know, it's the way
Have you ever heard of crow?
Yeah, you ever hear of frog?
Frogs do that kind of funny vocalization, right?
Sometimes it's a scream
Sometimes it's a scream
What?
He's out there doing what he's...
The dude is running around
Crazy, naked, screaming
And what else?
Cutting himself
Cutting himself, go to the next one
Why is he cutting himself?
How do you think they're getting their high of sky unless?
How do you think that they're getting that henbane?
It's dermal applications
You combine that with the purple, right?
Oh my God, you've got a recipe for causing yourself
to have burning mouth with inflamed lips, right?
And a psychosis
And if you add the scepterian to that
Your guy in the cemetery who's nuts
Now also has an erection
A psychotic person with an erection
Don't worry though, this is a healing process, right?
This is how you heal someone
Yeah, you shove every ounce of garbage out of them
You're putting them through this
Just, you know, trust it
Not centuries and centuries of Bacchic worship
That resulted in Judaism and Christianity
For no reason, right?
It's a strong, predominant, yeah, yeah
Bring it up, yeah, yeah, oh yeah
I forgot to mention the lupae
Look, you know, these are our wolves
You've got to remember that when we get to Rome
With all of this information
We're sitting there, you know
And these poor Romans, all they do is they build huts
You know what I mean? Come on
You know, they're not that sophisticated
But they do have a tribe of priestesses
A group of priestesses
And these priestesses are trained
Wolves, right?
They are the ones who are suckled
Wait, what?
Yeah, they're suckled
Who suckles them?
Romulus and Remus, baby
Right, right
Romulus and Remus
They go through the process
They receive that milk
They know that place
Yeah, yeah
Do you see her now?
And how important she is?
They called the lupa
They called her a prostitute
She was the one who was serving
Who was overcome by Mars
Do you understand those of you with ears to hear?
Do you understand?
Yeah, you know why it is that she wins all the time
All the time, yeah
Call it big brain if you want
Call it understanding the universe
But that's the very same reason that Jesus gets stuck
In a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked kid
Screaming, I'm not a sex trafficker
Yeah, oh God, love it
Let's go to the last, this is the last
I'm coming right now, yeah, go ahead
Oh, and I had a verse to show he was naked
Because he gets back dressed
He gets dressed up, long and short of the story
He gets dressed up again
And people from the city come out
And they're finally like, huh?
Look at him, he's not crazy anymore
He's sitting there totally within a place of sanity
There's a reason that this naked man
High on drugs ran up to Jesus the Christ
Yeah, for his resolution
For his healing
Yeah, oh God, that's gorgeous
That's gorgeous
And finally, the last one
Yep, there, yep, I want to go
Just go and hit this last one
For some reason I'm putting it there
Yeah, okay, people, look at this
Just in case you were uncomfortable
Here's the Greek from the Septuagint
Talking about coitus and, well
Spermatos
Ooh, do not
Do not defile yourself with it
Did you know you could be defiled by it?
Yes, yes, you can have acatharsia
That which is not purged
That which is the corruption
Ooh, there it is that life bubbles
Oh God, let's bring it down
I want to bring on gnostic informant
And I want to say before Neil jumps in
Go ahead and put him up
I hope he's there, did he?
Thank you for staying with us, Neil
I appreciate it, thank you very much
I was a dog
And I'm sure people can't wait to hear from you
I want to ask you right off the top here
You worked on a video that is spectacular
And in the beginning of that video
You showed a little clip of somebody
Dan McClellan, right?
And he is asked a question by one of his many followers
He's asked a question, hey
What is this about Dionysus and Jesus?
What are the parallels between them?
And he, of course, mockingly and very arrogant
Dan, cut the arrogance dude
It doesn't, it doesn't suit you
And I know your Greek socks bra
And I'll literally break you in half
Through the Greek, right?
Intellectually Dan, I'm going to take your pants down
And I'm going to do things to you
Yeah, but here's the problem
I think Neil has basically already done that
And I just want Neil, is it true?
Do you think Dan?
I'm just going to ask you this
Because I don't want to get you in trouble
And I don't want other people to be
I can say, I can talk about it
I can say something, here, do you want me to say this?
So I was disappointed in his video
Because when the person asked him a question
About something that he probably doesn't know about
Or wasn't immersed in or never heard of
Instead of just saying, I don't have any idea
To that question, there's probably other
Classists who can answer that question
I'm a Bible scholar
That would have been a good answer
Or does not make the video
But what he did was, he did this weird thing
And this isn't in my video
This isn't in his video
I didn't want to waste all the time
I'm not trying to waste time on his video
It was only a quick intro
But what he did was, he did this weird thing
Where he pulled up an article from like 40, 50 years ago
That no one talks about
Or it was a, I'm sorry, it wasn't an article
It was a translation of the Bacchai
It was a bad translation
A lot of people have already acknowledged
Now, classes have already shut this thing down
And said, this is trash
Nobody, this is not, nobody takes this thing seriously
I've never even heard of it
So he brings up this translation that's bad
And goes, this guy in his really bad translation
Tries to say, Semil is a virgin
He says, Semil, you're wrong
And I'm just saying to myself
Why does he, okay
In my video, I cited like 10 scholars
Who have written about this
Donald, Kyle Ruck, Crystal Ball
I can't remember her and her name
You know, I literally, it's all in my video
I go through and say, this person wrote about
The Gospel of Luke and the Bacchai
This person wrote about the Gospel of John and the Bacchai
Known as did this
These other Christian authors did this
The Nazi in Peter said this
This scholar from this place said this
This scholar, I'm like going through all the material
And for some reason, none of that gets brought up in the video
But instead, you brought up this random translation of the Bacchai
And said, see, this is not good stuff
Don't look into this stuff
It's all just bunch of people looking and squinting and trying to figure out
But that was a really, to me, that was like
And I was going to say this about people like Bart Ehrman
And Dan McClellan
Who are great Bible scholars
But when they start talking about stuff outside of the Bible
They don't look that great
I'm just saying, Bart Ehrman has been, I've seen
I've seen him write articles where he confuses Demetrius with Diogenes
It's like, dude, you're out of your element
It's fine, nobody's an expert in everything
You don't have to be the all-religion guru of the world
Just stay with what you know
Don't try to like get all, and I think there's like this
I think it's in the SBL circles
Where there's this like sort of a dogma
And making Christianity this like
Like, because here's what I think is going on
These are critical scholars who are very good at being critical of
A lot of stuff in the Bible that fundamentalists are pushing
Dan McClellan's all over that shit
It's always credit, I love it
So is Bart Ehrman
But they have this other side where it's like, I don't know if it's like
They're trying to balance themselves out
When any chance they get to credit
It's almost like if it's so obvious
The side goes to the critical side
They'll attack and say this is wrong
But if there's any doubt that Christianity can have something right
They just credit that, they just say this is correct
Or the dating of the text or something
I don't know if this makes sense to you
But do you understand what I'm saying about that?
There's this like mentality where in the SBL circles
Where Christianity is special, unique
And needs to be in its own box
Separate from all the other classics
And that to me is where I think they screw up
Their entire system of epistemology
Christianity is in this special world
With a force field around it
And there's no influence
It's a Greek text, it's in Greek
That's why Neo-classicists laugh
And I'm really underneath, I'm blustery
I'm really laughing at Dan McClellan
I'm laughing at him because he has a show going
I've watched some of his stuff
And he leads you on as if he has this knowledge
And you can tell he really doesn't
It was the same thing with Kip Davis
You can tell when he made a statement about Greek
He had no idea what he was talking about
Intellectually, intellectually
These guys need to be driven to a place of shame
Where because of what they're doing
Our viewers out there, they don't know
They don't know whether or not
He's really that good in Greek or not
They don't know if his arguments are sound
And pastors all over the world do that
And it's like a little device that it's like
You see someone taking advantage of a kid
Dan McClellan is taking advantage of that innocence
That somebody is going to give you the benefit of the doubt
And that kind of Kip Davis stuff, Dan McClellan
That stuff is disreputable
Boys, you got to stand up for the wrong that you're doing
You love it, love it
That's what I would encourage you
In the spirit of healing and cleansing
I would encourage you to step up guys
And to say, look, we were just kind of using authority over you
We really don't do this work
And you get into these texts, you see the total opposite
So tell me, how do you think Dan took your video?
Do you think he saw it?
I have no idea, I have no idea to be honest
And I don't want to share because the video wasn't really about just him
It was just kind of like an intro to show
Look, this is a topic that is not well researched in my opinion
And I think, here's what I think is going on
The classicists are letting the Bible scholars keep the Bible
And let them deal with it
And then the Bible scholars are saying
Well, the classicists aren't saying anything about Dionysus and Jesus
So it must not be there
Which is not true technically
Because a lot of classes have said stuff about this
And then they get responses like
Well, the Bible scholars aren't saying this
So how are you right?
And there's like these two bubbles happening
And if you just train New Testament scholars and classics
Then this whole thing might open up
And Kip Davis is my friend
I'm not going to talk crap about him
But I asked him
You're going to laugh when you hear this
And this is not me talking shit
This is just Kip being honest and he told me this
How much Greek, because he has a Ph.D.
Not in Ted Z Scrolls
I didn't know this
He has a Ph.D. in theology and religion
And I go, what?
So how much Greek did you have to learn?
Theology is a Greek word
It comes from Plato
It comes from Orpheus the theologian
It comes from the Greeks
It's a Greek thing
Theology is a Greek thing
And I'm thinking to myself
How much Greek did you were you required
To get this, how much Plato did you have to read?
He laughed and said none
I'm like, why don't they just give you a degree
And say Ted Z Scrolls
Because he's a whiz of the Ted Z Scrolls
He's a whiz
He knows everything about the Ted Z Scrolls
He can tell you what manuscript numbers and what verses
He knows all that shit
He's trained in that
But I'm like, why do they give you that title then?
It's just weird
It's just a weird thing
Because these people
They kind of present themselves as scholars of religion
But it's like
How much do you know about the same one
Thracian Mysteries?
Huh?
What about Symezias?
Huh?
What about the Thracians?
What about like
What we can go into like
All this stuff that never gets talked about
By any Bible scholars ever
Right
Ever
What about the Theosipsistos
In the 2nd century BC
What about that?
What are you talking about?
Yeah
They don't know
Like this is like gibberish to them
It's they don't
They're not
None of them
In their whole 8 to 10 years of going to school
This stuff doesn't even get brought up
It's only in the classes this world
Yeah
No
I saw both worlds, Neal
I got my degree in classics
And taught in classics
And I taught at a seminary
And I can tell you for a fact
It's giving them the ability
To be able to go back to those texts
That thing is revolutionary
We can give somebody the ability
To see the history
For what it was
Not through any kind of filter
That's based on theology
Or any ideology
But just the facts of the history
Just the real sauce
You liberate them
You liberate them
The best thing you could do for Christianity
Is to give them leaders
Who could actually read those texts
Sure
I tell my students
Every semester that I was in seminary
I'm not there anymore
Because as you know
You know, they thought that I
Somebody saw me fly through some walls
And do some magic
Which whatever
You know, it's all inadmissible, right?
So
When you're in that situation
As a classist
You can see how important it is
That they're able to find
That source
And work with the source
And Christians don't do that
I've never met
I've not met one yet
That is a real master
Of classical Greek and Latin
Never
Never
So we'll see
We'll see what happens
Maybe that's a challenge
One last thing
Tell us
One last thing about this
Then I want to show you some stuff
About Adam and Adam
I have some stuff on that
Kyle Ruck
Was the first to really do
What you're doing right now
And go into the trenches
And challenge some of this shit
So if you read his book
The Road to Eleusis
The book that was heavily criticized
And shot down
And then vindicated over time
As these
As classics caught up to him
Basically, that's kind of funny
If you think about it
It's true
Classics caught up to Kyle Ruck
How does one person get so
You see, smarter than everyone else
Is he got a higher IQ?
No, it's not that
He's reading the text
He's immersed in the world of Greek
He loves it
He does it for fun
This is the difference between
Somebody who just goes to college
To be a professor
And they just read modern articles
From modern scholarship
And think that's all you have to do
And then don't read the primary sources
So I'll give you an example
At the end of his book
The Road to Eleusis
He talks
There's a debunking section
At the end
It's in the appendix
And he talks about the current
Archaeologist
He names the guy
I forgot the person's name
Some sort of professor
PhD archaeologist
Who was digging up
Eleusis
And this guy starts talking about
There is no connection
To Demeter and Dionysus at all
We haven't found anything
In the archaeology
And Kyle Ruck was like
Dude, even if that's true
That you found nothing
In Eleusis of Dionysus
You're just wrong
This is what the sources say
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Just obliterates them
With the primary text
Strabo says this
By the way
Yacos is a term
It's a name for Dionysus
It's also a name for Demeter
And only them two shared that title
No one else
You don't see that with Apollo
Nobody else
So it's like
Yeah
Maybe you have an understanding
Of the archaeology
And you're looking at the data
The raw data
And you say
All I see is this
So therefore it's all that
This is one of those things
Where you think about
If a tree falls down
In a place that no one's there to see it
Then it happened
And the answer is yes, it happened
But now how do we find that?
We have to find out how to document stuff
That's not necessarily like
We have to be able to connect the dots
And we have to be able to do
Interpret the data
And by the way, Damoclin always says this
In the data
He always says in the data
Which is fine
The data doesn't always mean
You're going to find it saying
Adamus is where Adam comes from
You're not going to find a text that says that
You have to do the work
And you have to read the text
And interpret the data
To find this stuff out
So that's what I'm getting at
I'm saying some of this stuff
Might sound speculative
But then we will
We're talking about the data as a whole
Then it starts to make sense
When you're immersed in these texts
This stuff makes more sense
That's all I'm saying
I'm not saying I'm smarter than everybody
Or I'm not an expert
And they're not
I'm just saying there's certain things
Where if you are
And this is just being a nerd, actually
You can find Star Wars nerds
Who know more about Star Wars
Than some of the directors of Star Wars
Probably
Because they're just like super nerdy at it
And those could go
Wait a minute
Actually Darth Vader said this
Oh, shit
I did write that
And that's the thing
Like sometimes being very immersed
And loving this stuff
For just as
Because that's a part of who you are
Gives you that upper
Like that Kaurak advantage
Yeah
And you know what?
That's why you gotta love the guy
And his draw to that
That language
And those texts
Is so strong
You can see it in his eyes
There's a tenderness about him
And it's a beautiful, beautiful love
For that beauty that is classical Greek
He swims in that
And he has so much
You don't understand the ground
That Karl Ruck has covered
Right?
People out there
Like Kip and Dan
They have studied more than he's forgotten
Right?
I mean he's
I said that backwards
He's forgotten more than they have studied
Probably
I mean he's that close
He really respects the muse
Karl Ruck is a man
Who followed the muse his life
And I have tremendous respect for him
Here's to you
Here's to you, Lukamo
For what you've brought
And he was
You're right, Neil
He was standing in the breach
Right?
When those other classes were back
Just securing their jobs
And getting a little bit of fame
That they could possibly get
They were saying harsh things about him
They were like really going after his character
Like assassinating his character
Being beyond the scholarship
Like he was getting so much hate
For the stuff that he was producing
In his text
And then all of a sudden
20 years goes by
And then there's more research being done
Into entheogens
And Elzinian mysteries
And Greek mystery cults
All of a sudden it's like
Holy shit
Everything he's been saying
Is coming to light
And like all those people who criticized him
20 years ago look like morons
That don't know the material
And I predict that 20 years from now
This is what we're going to be saying
About scholars in the SPL
That's what I'm saying
Yeah, totally
I totally agree
I totally agree
Okay, Neil
Tell me really quick
What is the new area that you're going to be working on
For your next video?
I just want like
It's coming along quick
It's coming along quick
Okay, I just
I'm almost done with it already
I'm coming along quick
I have the whole 10,000 word
Script written out
10,000 words
It's about the Pulaskians
Proto-Indo-Europeans
Scythians, Thracians
Celts
Germanic Pagans
Italic Pagans
Going all the way to India
Into the Hindu stuff
And I'm doing
And I'm showing how all this stuff is connected
That's my next video
I already have
I already started recording it on the microphone
I'm already halfway through it
It's going to be out quick
I hope
I hope you do the Pulaskians
Oh, it's all
I introduce them as the Pulaskians
I basically say in the video
Whether you want to call them Pulaskians
Eurasians
Aryans
I don't care
This is what we're getting at
The same thing
Right
And I'm so glad you're doing it
Because there's so many classical sources
They just throw them in
Just a mention of them
Oh, yeah
Thessaly, it's originally Pulaskian
They just throw that stuff in
And you're like
Who are these Pulaskians
And classicists have traditionally
Ignored them
Ignored them
But not only that
They say it's mythological people
But hold on a second though
They're only brought up
Well, I guess Homer writes about them
In Iliad and stuff like that
But whatever
You could say that's mythological
And even Homer's not talking about them
In a mythological sense
He's talking about them
He literally throws them into tribes
Like it's Homer will name six tribes
All five of those tribes are real tribes
And then Pulaskians are next to them
Wait, you're telling me that only this one tribe
Didn't exist
But these five do
Herodotus mentions the Pulaskians a hundred times
Probably not a hundred times
I'm just exaggerating
He mentions them all throughout his texts
He never says these are mythological people
They're talking about the Pulaskians
That's not how they're being described
In the ancient sources
So we're just interpreting it our own way
Saying we can't find anything
We can't find any people that call themselves
Pulaskians in any text
That's because these people existed before writing
So whether we call them
This is what I'm saying in my video
Whether we call them proto-Indo-Europeans
Which we made up
Nobody called themselves that
So what's the difference between that and Pulaskian?
You know what I mean?
I guess Aryans is like a real
People did call themselves Aryans
People call themselves Meads too
But obviously getting as I'm saying
These people all came from this black sea region
In between the black and Caspian sea
The steppe area
Or it all begins
By the way, right there is where the cultivation of the vine
Is discovered
Where wine is discovered
So this is Dionysian to its core
This is why you find all these Dionysians
And there's so many gods
Like Dionysus
That are like the Scythians
Have so many different tribes
This is like getting really micro into this
And they all have these different names for these gods
But their functions
You can see them
Oh, that's Zeus
Papaios
Papaios, that's Zeus
Oh, he's a skyfather
Oh, there's another god
Goddess
Earth goddess
Oh, that's like Gaia
And you can see there's a connection going on
And then you see this god
He's the vine bearer
And he's like
The moisture gives growth to the crops
He's the vegetation dying and rising god
The son of the skyfather
There's just so much lining up
In all these different cultures
And you know, Carl Jung
Gives it the word archetype, vine
I guess that's cool
But I'm just saying
Even if it's just an...
He's trying to get it
It's all like in the...
These are archetypes that come from our minds
But I'm saying
It's even simpler than that
These people all descended from a common ancestry
By the way, this is mind blowing too
Drugs, ancient drugs
Is at the center of all this stuff
Because the words for holy
The words for god
When you find out that they're...
That if you look at the Indians
The Sanskrit
You compare it to the Germanic
And you compare it to the Avestan stuff
That's in Persia
And then you find that these words
Are a little bit tweaked
Haoma
Soma
Gotta
Which means...
Which is the word for god
The word god comes from the word drug
Soma
So you're talking about being...
The word god itself
Has a connection to the ancient drugs
To the Soma
Yeah, in that little bit
That I just showed from diascortes
They call it, right?
They're calling it the Dionysius
The deathy ram, right?
They're using his title and saying
The drug is him
This equation
That's why the Greeks come up with the concept
Of entheosis, right?
To have the god inside of you
How do you get the god inside of you?
Right?
Through the plant
That's how...
That's the avenue
That's the avenue
By the way, everybody...
The rootcutters are the priestesses
Why are they called rootcutters?
All the priestesses we call the rootcutter
What is she doing with root...
Because they're making...
Because what do you think...
I mean, DMT
What do you think the number one
Way to get DMT is
From roots
Did you know that?
I bet you a lot of SPL scholars
Don't know that
DMT, the hot...
Is it toad?
That's the hot...
And they're very rare
You're not going to buy the toad in the mail
You have to go and find one somewhere
Which is very...
Logistic-wise
It doesn't make sense
But these roots are everywhere
Acacia trees
Mimosa trees
The roots
You cut the roots up
You blend it in some water
You soak out the juices
You mix it up
You do this whole process
I can tell you it
But I'm not going to do it here
There's a whole process
Where you can get
ayahuasca or DMT
From roots
So these root cutters
Were figuring this shit out
Way before we did
And this is at the center
Of religion itself
That's why I'm like...
When a religious scholar
Doesn't think this is crazy
Or you're out there, man
What the hell, man?
This is...
I don't...
This is crazy
No, you don't know
What you're talking about
This is at the center of it all
Because if you look at these ancient texts
Soma
Haoma
And Gota
Kaikyan
Kukyan
These are all these...
And this is every...
This is the center of the mystery
This is the initiation
This is the most important aspect
Of the religion
And then you have in Christianity
You have a Eucharist
You don't think there's a connection there?
I think you need to do some more reading
To be honest
Totally
I think you need to do some more reading
I'm going to quote you
And next time I get one of these biblical scholars
That the classes is laugh at
Because they're so bad
I'm going to say
You need to listen to Neal
From Gnostic Informant, man
And go there
You know what I mean?
Neal, I love it
And I love the fact
By the way
Don't...
I know you may have already
Included it in your video
But remember that
Medea in Seneca's Medea
Is using Pulaskean
And in her chance
And he even says that
In the text
Seneca says that in the text
Why would Seneca be so interested in that?
Because the
Caesars and their libraries
Were always interested
In the Pulaskean connection
With the Etruscans
And which we know
Linguistically is probably there
Because of what...
They said that their Trojan blood
Because Aeneas founded the city of Latium
The Trojans are part of that
Pulaskean
One of the Pulaskean tribes
Right
So they figured it out
And by the way
And they've invented this
I don't know how they knew this
But it turns out
The Italic people are
Closely connected to the people
From the Black Sea region
They had that same
I don't know how you...
Haplogroup, whatever
I don't know
It's the same language types
And the same genetic types
As people from that region
So they migrated west into Italy
At some point
At some point during that age maybe
Or even the end of the Stone Age
Yeah, the Tiersanoi baby
The Tiersanoi
And the connection
Remember Cersei?
She lives off the coast of Italy
They kicked her out
Because of what she was trying to do
Power-wise
So that connection
Between the Black Sea
These are priestesses
Of the Caesarines
Man, these are priestesses
Of that area now
That they're fighting over
They're trying to take back
From Russia, right?
We were talking
We were talking about Medea
Being from the eastern coast
Of the Black Sea
And Colchis, right?
Yeah
And the Medes
Who have become the most powerful
Dynasty in the world
The Persian Empire
That's a Mede empire
They're found by people
Who are Medeans, Medes
And the Medes
It says in Herodotus and in Diodorus
The Medes formerly
Were called Aryans
And they changed their name
To be of Medea
Yeah
Medes means Medea
Like they're related to Medea
Right
They're the sons of Medea
Right
And by the way
In Pontus
This rich
Rich country pops up
In the 3rd, 2nd century BCE
This kingdom of Pontus
And it's
The capital
And you have
Mithridates, the 6th
The Poison King
And you know what he says?
By the way
There's a story about his birth
Where three magi come and visit him
And there's a star
It's really, really eerily similar
To Christianity's birth scene
But guess what it also says?
That he's descended
From both Alexander the Great
And Cyrus the Great
Making him the fucking king
Of the world
Like this is like
But everybody was obsessed with genetics back then
Everybody
Caesar has Venus's blood
And this person is related to this person
Well this is like
No way
You have a king
Who's born from Alexander the Great
And Cyrus the Great
He's the greatest of all time
So he rises up
Becomes a fucking
They said that
All the wealth he had
If you convert it into dollars
It'd be like
Past the trillions
It'd be like uncountable
How much wealth he had
He also had
He also had the
Theriac that was meant
To balance the communion
From the dark harbor
And writes about it, right?
We have the
We have Roman
Here's a Roman physician
Who wrote about it
And he said by the way
The real thing that you need to do
With the toxicon
Is you need to take the
Mithridatic remedy
He said that will balance it
And I thought, wow
Look at that
I mean the tech there
Is fantastic, right?
You're developing
Bronze age stuff
Funnily through all that
Scientific advancement
Of Hellenism
And boom, right?
And people think
Well the Black Sea
That's Hellenism
Yeah it is, right?
Who do you think they're
Worshiping?
Worshiping Diana, right?
Even the Lacedace
They're worshiping Diana
So, oh my God
I love it
So when is this video
Going to come out?
I would say probably
By the end of next week
Okay, okay
Look at how much work that is
Can you just say something about that?
How much work do you put into
One of these videos?
All day
This is what I do
All day long
When you add up
Your script writing
One time I leave the house
To go to the gym sometimes
Every other day maybe
You know, not every day
Every other day
Go to the gym
So I don't get like
Cause I was
When I first started doing YouTube
Full time
I was working at a factory
And I left the factory
And I was in pretty decent shape
Back then
From standing up all day
And moving tires around
And then I started sitting around
Editing videos all day
And never leaving the house
And then I gained a bunch of weight
So now I'm like figuring out
Okay, now I gotta do something
I gotta get out of the house
And work out
And touch grass a little bit
Which I've been doing
Which I have to, you know
And I spend
You mean
Neal is transforming
Into Hercules
As we sit here and watch
He is becoming Hercules
And I know
I know that he knows
That's a lot deeper
Than just making jokes
Right, and he has a lot more
Respect for that
But I'm fully expecting Neal
Someday for
Look, if when
Like I said
When the stuff happens
I need you in the boat
Right, we need to work together
Because I'm gonna need you
As Hercules
And I think it's fantastic
I think it's fantastic that
You're not only building
That muscle
But with your scholarship
Raw, you're killing people
Right, you're killing
We're slaying
I know you don't want
I know you don't want me to say it
My amateur scholarship is poison arrows
Yeah, exactly
Hercules and exactly
Right, and I know you don't
Want me to say it
But you just mounted
Dan McClellan's backside
On your wall
You did
You took him
You took him down
He's got nothing
He can't stand it
He doesn't
I'll bet you
I'm willing to bet
He doesn't even know
How to track your sources
I'll bet he wouldn't
Even understand
How to prove you wrong
Or right
And the funny thing is
If you bothered
To get into those sources
To try to prove you wrong
You would see
Exactly what you're saying
Because your video
Was just you
Presenting sources
I love it
I love it, baby
Last thing I want to say
Before we go on to my thing
Do you really think it's
A coincidence that the
Dionysian epiphany
Was celebrated on the same day
As the Christian epiphany
Which is the same day
As the Dushour's epiphany
Which is the same day
As the Ion epiphany
All of them are celebrate
On January 6th
What?
No way, dude
You're crazy
The people who thinks
It's just a coincidence
What are you talking about?
That's a miracle
There's no way
There's something culturally happening
Within Christianity
As well as all these other cults
In the Eastern realms
Of the Roman Empire
And they're connected
And Christian scholars
Don't want to admit this
They want to think Christianity
Is like this offshoot of Judaism
Perfectly pure
And even though it presents itself
As anti-Pagan
Of course
Sort of the Platonist
A lot of people
A lot of people pretend to be anti-Pagan
But still bower from Pagans
This is like a normal thing
At that time period
Alright
Alright, Neil
Hit it
You were going to present something
I'm going to
I'm going to disappear
For a few minutes
Everybody, here is Neil
Alright
So I've got a screen on the bottom
That I want to present
So the word adopt
Adamus
It means indestructible
Right?
Now, Parmenides uses this word
To describe the four elements
In his on nature
Which is interesting
Because he talks about God
Creating the cosmos
Using four elements
And you almost
It's almost
Right off the bat
My spite, he said
Is just tingling
Because I'm looking at the Genesis
And God creating Adam
And taking his rib off
And creating Iwa
Right?
So I'm like
Okay, that's just a hypothesis
At this time
So I just put that aside
For a little bit
By the way
Adamus
Or Adam
Is very
Closely looked
Very closely related to
Hadis
Or Hades
Spelled with the aspirated A
A-D-E-S
So you're looking at two names
Starting with A-D
Whenever you see something like that
You should kind of go
Well, let's look into this
You got
Ad-Adis
And the Kori
Who's called Iwa
This is a thing
Persephone's two titles
Well, she has a lot of titles
One of them is Iwa
And she gets stuck in Hadis
For eating the pomegranate
Almost in a mirror image
Sense analogous to
Eve getting cast out of
Paradise for eating fruit
By the way
The consensus right now
Is that it wasn't an apple
It was a pomegranate
Most people think that's what it was
It's hard to prove this
But most scholars think this was a pomegranate
That Eve aids
Anyways
I have it
Put that source back up
If you don't mind
So the next thing I want to show is
Whoops
Sorry about that
Alright
Let me
I clicked on
Instead of
I clicked on my screen
To share
Alright
So I got that screen back up now
Alright
Sorry about that
Alright now
The next thing I want to go to is Play-Doh
Alright
Play-Doh talks about this
And is Tamaeus
You can tell it's very
Parminidian
He's very
He's very well
Being
Influenced by Parmini
Or Empedocles
I'm sorry
Empedocles
Or both of them
The both of them talk about the
Elements
Right
Empedocles is first, actually, I think
Anyway, it doesn't matter
Play-Doh is writing about these elements
See, you could see the top, the four kinds
And he's talking about the demi-urge
Creating the universe
We call it the cosmos
Right
So
I'm not going to read all this
This is a lot
But I just want to highlight some things that he talks about
When he's talking about the demi-urge
Creating the cosmos
With four elements
So
He says it right here
He says
Well, you just saw the four kinds
Talks about fire, earth, water, and air
Solid bodies
And form a body
Huh
That's interesting
Form a body
By the way
He also talks about
In this same text
I don't have it in front of me
You can look this up for yourself
That check me, please do that
Always check what I'm saying
In this same exact text
I don't know if it's before this or after
But at some point he talks about
The different races of humans
That are made from these elements
There's the golden race
The silver race
The bronze race
And so forth
And
It makes you think like
Because
Well
I'm already trying to compare it to Genesis
And thinking like
You have this indestructible atom
Who lives for like
Thousands of years
Or whatever
Thousands of years
Nine hundred years
Whatever
And
He's the first atom
And Jesus is the last second atom
Right
So you have like a new creation thing going on
But let me put that aside
Let me put that for
Let me jump ahead on this real quick
I just want to show one more thing
So he talks about
He uses this word
To describe the elements
Adam
A dominant
Which means indestructible
He's talking about the
Indestructible
Mixture of these elements
He calls it an offshoot of gold
Which is very hard
Because of its density
And black in color
Is called a dominant
So he uses the same word
Which
You're all probably wondering
Why doesn't he just say
Adam
Why is there more letters
And you know
Greek is like that
But I think there's a better reason
For why they shorten this to Adam
And I'll get to that in a second
But he says
And the kind
Which closely resembles gold
In its particles
But has more forms than one
And the density
Is more dense than gold
And partakes of small
And fine portions of earth
So that it is harder
While it is also lighter
Owing its
Having large interstices
What is that
Interstices within it
This particular kind
Of the bright and solid waters
Being compounded thus
Is termed bronze
And this is the time
With the bronze race
This is talking
He's talking about mortals
Being created
Get it?
And the portion of earth
That is mixed
By the way
There is that earth
Remember everyone says
Adam means earth
See it now?
The portion of earth
That is mixed
Therewith
Becomes distinct by itself
And both grow old
And separate
Each
Again each
Form the other
And then it is named rust
That's like the lowest level
Rust
Alright
That's just
I'm just throwing hypotheses out there right now
Now I want to show you
Something from the sibling oracles
Because I've always said this
Sibling oracles reveals
A lot of these mysteries
They tell a lot of this stuff
Like when you want to look
We want to know the origins of Christianity
Read the sibling oracles
Because what you're getting
In the sibling oracles
Is you're getting people who are
Not, they don't care
They're not like team Judaism
Or team paganism
Or team this
Like these are people
Within mystery religions
That are doing it
Mixing all this stuff
Sort of like what you get
In the Greek magical papyri
But these are simply
These are Roman texts
Written for the priestly class
In the Romans
This is like high level
Secret stuff
Like not everybody had
Not everybody had access
To these texts
Now if you
I think it's f1 is search right
Whoops
I'm still here right
Okay good
Let me see
If I search for Adam
Check this out
There's a connection
With Hades with Adam
Right up the bat
It says
Which snatched the dreadful men
Away from life
And Hades then received them
It was called Hades
Since Adam
Having tasted death
Went first
And earth
Encompassed him around
And therefore
All men
Born upon the earth
Are in a boat of Hades
Called to go
Whoa okay
Let's keep going
What else did they say
About Adam
There's that word again
They use it to describe
The gates of Hades
So you got the
Instructible gates of Hades
They're using that same word
Indestructible
Right
Alright
Here's where things get wild
In my opinion
Because often in the sibling
Oracles
It's not just here
It's other places too
This is such a weird title
Can you guys see the screen right now
Where I have it highlighted
Maybe I can zoom in a little bit
Let's see if I can do that
Yeah there we go
Let's do this
Okay
Is that better?
Okay that's better
This is the God
Who formed
Four lettered Adam
The first one formed
And filling with his name
East, west, south and north
The same as he
Who fixed the pattern of the human form
And made wild beasts
Now this is a really
Odd esoteric passage in my opinion
Four
What
Who do you know that's ever called
Four lettered anything
My name is Four lettered
Neal
Nobody calls me Four lettered Neal
What a weird title to give somebody
Four lettered
Well
What if
Adam being Four letters
Is something to do with the Four elements
The Four
And this is like
They're tetragrammaton
Like yahoo gets extended to Yahweh
Because you know the oldest
Fragments of Yahweh
It's three letters
All of a sudden it gets four letters
This is a weird thing going on
With numbers
I don't know what it is
I'm still researching this
It's still in my hypothesis zone right now
But I just want to throw this at you
The idea that he's called
Four lettered Adam
It's like why is he called Four lettered Adam
Why isn't it just Adam
Or why isn't it something else
Because it signifies
Something's going on there
There's a reason why he's Four letters
And I'm thinking
When we're looking at these other texts
That I showed you
With Adamus being the indestructible elements
That the Demiurge used to craft humans with
The Earth
And this is why I think Adam becomes
Also called Earth
Because there's a connection here
They're using the indestructible elements
Of the Earth
To create humans with
Adam being the first one
Alright
Now you're probably thinking
This is a little wild
Let me get some more evidence for this
Sure
I got one thing for you
This is going to be cool
Alright
I'm going to share my screen one more time
Let me see this
Okay
Once you see it
Pop it up on the screen
There we go
This is the Samothoration Mysteries
Now a lot of us know about this
Because we love mystery religions
So we're all thinking
Oh yeah, I love this
By the way
In the sources and in the archaeology
These are the oldest of all
This is like Pulaskian stuff
By the way, Pulaskians are
We're inhabited that region
But they call themselves Pulaskians too
And they're identified with this island
This secret magical mystery religion island
Where these sacred priests who held the oldest
According to Diodorus
According to Strabo
According to Herodotus
According to basically anyone that writes about
Samothrations
They're the oldest priestly class of all
They're holding onto mysteries that are so old
They go back to like the stone age
Right
Well, let's look at this for a second
What do they got going on?
Well, it turns out that they have a primordial hero
Called Adamus
The spiritual person
Okay
The Nazian preacher
Identifies this Adamus
With Adam
And he also calls Jesus the second Adamus
So you already have a connection going on
With Adamus
By the way, this name means an indestructible hero
He's the indestructible hero
That's the primordial god
Like demigod of the mysteries
And so
Brief history of the mystery rights
The rights went back to pre-Greek Thracian-Palaskian
Inhabitants of the Samothrations
This is why the priests of the rights
Preserved in their liturgies
Pre-Greek Thracian words
This is why my video has so much on it
Thracians are the
I love the Thracians
I can't wait to tell you guys about the Thracians
They are the best
They are the best
I'm starting to almost like them more than the Greeks
I'm sorry
I know that's blasphemy to some of you
The Thracians are the fucking best
I'm sorry
I have to say it
And by the way, the Greeks would say that too
The Greeks love the Thracians
All the religion in Athens is all Thracians shit
Imported
Orpheus was a Thracian bard
You know what I'm saying? You get it?
Dionysus is all over Thracia anyways
So you have this religion where
That's pretty much it
Okay, that's it
Stop sharing
So you have a primordial demigod
Called Adamus
In the oldest mystery religion
It's way older than Judaism or Christianity
Before there's any thought on the radar
Because they're all polytheists in Judea at this time
They're not...
There's no Judaism yet
It's a way...
That's a...
Hellenistic thing
And maybe Persian thing
And the source is a Hellenistic thing
There's no synagogue till 200 BCE
Not one
So I'm just saying like
This is stuff that predates Genesis
And now
By the way
There's other words for man in Hebrew
It's not Adam
Adam is a secondary term
They don't say, hey, that Adam over there
Get him over here
There's another word that you...
I can't take it for right now
It is...
I think it's ish
I should know that
But I just forgot
You're right
Can you imagine, Neil?
Can you imagine now the person who stepped up
And who was having to compose the Torah
In Greek
They're making this text
And they're trying to establish their own tradition
It'll give them the legitimacy that they need
And what are they doing?
They're...
Look at what you've done with Adam
They're borrowing from the Greek tradition
And they're trying to claim it
They're trying to be able to say
Okay, it's appropriation
And of course they have to
Because they're buried in Alexandria
With the behemoth
That is the Greek tradition of history and drama
All sorts of lyric poetry
They're buried by that
So you can see that whoever wrote it
Was trying to justify or create a culture
Right?
So, yeah, we see that
I love the fact that what you're doing
Is you're looking at it from those texts
And where they are in history
It's brilliant
And you know, nobody...
I know that this is a war, baby
For this knowledge
And nobody can stand against you
When you just pull out those sources like that
I love it, man
I love it
Congratulations on doing such a great job
I do want to ask you about your presentation
I want to ask you
What was that I saw about
You flashed it off the screen real quick
You don't bring it back
But it was something about erections
With Adam
Something about Adam's erection
Do you think it's strange
That they would be focusing on it?
Isn't that just in the temples
To the muse
We've got a giant erect phallus there
That's part of the deal
Are you saying that these people had their own
Hermes
And do you think those statues of Hermes
With the erections on them
That we see all over the roads
They're like mile markers
You've got a Hermes there with a big erection
I thought they are
They're directionals for people
Because you don't have GPS
You're not walking down with a map in your hand
You know what I mean
So you walk around these roads
Follow the erections
Follow the phallus
Points to the way
Fantastic
Oh, I love it
I'm going to give you the last word
Priapis is called the good
The agathos
The good dimon
Agathos dimon
Love it
God, isn't that good
People, look what
Look what
I'm going to end it there
Because that was pure dessert
You can see that
But Neil, I do want to ask you
You went to the Met
And you saw the room
With all the Priapis stuff
Can you tell people one minute on that?
There's hundreds of thousands of these things
I'm not joking
There's hundreds of thousands of these
Priapis statues
That Greeks and Romans
And Egyptians and Syrians
All would put on their houses
Like garden gnomes
And these were
Because Priapis is a symbol
The phallus
And if you read about Priapis
In the Orphic hymns
He's the last
Of the generation from Thanes
So sometimes their names hyphenated
Thanes Priapis
They're all one line of gods
Going from Thanes all the way through
To Dionysus
And then Dionysus and Aphrodite
The two most sacred gods
And goddess of the mysteries
Dionysus and Aphrodite
Venus and Bacchus
That's Lucifer, baby
That's the morning star
They can't get a better union than that
And they birth Priapis
Priapis is the holy child
Of Venus and Bacchus
What? How come no one ever talks about Priapis?
Where is he in the discussion of gods?
I'm bringing him out more
Because this is a big deal
He's the child of Venus and Bacchus
Oh god, you thration bastard
What are you doing?
You're gonna ruin us all
I love that
Look at how deep you are into that stuff
You're not gonna be able to come out of it, man
I'm not the one where I am
I'm Slavic, so I kind of am
Look, it's your own ancestors calling you
You know what I mean?
Oh my god
Okay, Chewie made a video
That I want to show
It's the hymn to Apollo
Just a short one
And I want you to see
Because Neil ended there on Lucifer
Ended there on Iosferos
And this is the house of the dawn bringer
Phosphorus
And Phosphorus
And Phosphorus
Yes, yes, right
Light bringer
Good, hit us, Chewie
