A second renaissance
Another drip from the glow and chalice
I'm with Medea's team
Everything I see is cream
Straight from the bang
Of the dragon
The tracks bump
It is the same
Athena knows my slang
In the dark harbor
The drugs wear done
Kachanga Lane
Creed Moore hit the mark
Bang bang
We're here to save the children
The museum we're building
Anti-Christ prescription
Dragan Venom, Ellen
Chalice, Adrien Venom
High purple Vine 211
Medea hit you with a ticket to heaven
Open trends, bring it back to the dead
Welcome back
This is a new thing we've got going tonight
To our audience that is large
I thank you for coming out
I value your time and I don't intend to
Take advantage of you
At least, not in that way
What I'd like to do is
I'd like to begin tonight
And just kind of guide you in
To the opening of AmenU
Let me tell you what I have to offer tonight
I have something so
Oh God, it's luscious
What I'm going to do is in a minute
I'm going to step down and I'm going to
Let the drill instructor in
The drill instructor is going to get you going
But first
But first
I was thanking to myself
And I thought, you know what
Something, something, it was unimportant
When I was thanking you know, typical me
And somebody called me and said
Take a look at this video
And I took a look at this video and it was
Some poetry
A vision
It was a vision
Of Marilyn Manson
And I want to bring that up now
Just to set as the ship is going
And you're about to enter
AmenU and see the structure
Pristine, gorgeous
Condition
As your mind
Gets off
Gets off
That place
Of
Slowness
And starts working like it should
Nature intended
Like those athletes
Oh God, you mean I could have been like that
This is that
For your mind
Are you ready people?
Let's get the little Marilyn Manson in here
Thank you
Chewie bring that more towards me so I can see it
I had a dream last night
Said Marilyn
And remember
This is the child of Marilyn Monroe
And Charles Manson
Right, the image child
Of Marilyn Monroe
And Charles Manson
You want to hear that dream?
I said do you want to hear that dream?
I was drowning in a sea of liquor
And I washed up
On a beach made of cocaine
The sky was made of LSD
And every tree
Was made of marijuana
But the cops pulled me over
They did not arrest me
Instead
They blanked my blank
And it was so beautiful
That God came down from heaven
He said to me
Marilyn Manson
We will no longer spell the word God
G-O-D
I said how do you want to spell it God
He said
Give me a D
Give me an R
Give me a U
Give me a G
Give me an S
And what does that spell
It spells
The history
That Marilyn Manson
Had tapped into
Through the muse
It spells
A-L-I-C-E
Alice
Oh God are we going to Wonderland
When I bring in this drill instructor
To you
You're going to Wonderland
Give me a couple of these I want to warm up
Everybody tonight before we get to it
Give me that second one
Is it possible
Is it possible
Mr. Manson
To
Take
Two things and meld them together
It is in the Greek
Mind, it is in the mind of those
Who had children
And one of them was named Alice
Oh God
What a freak
Here we go
This is a pharmacomantis
People you're going to be going in
For instruction tonight I want you to see
Some of the power of the T and T
That you're dealing with
Look at pharmacomantis
One who is at once pharmacos
And mantis
Oh that's fantastic
Or who uses pharmaca
Why
To divine
What does that divining
Have to do with anything
To be in the ion
In order to see the future
It's called
Ionic life
Can you hear the cult
In the language
Ionic life
The drill instructor is going to tell you
Who you are
I'm going to set this up by saying
Can you have something that is at once
A drug
And a vision
Can you have something
That is a prophetic power
That gives you the ability
To see the future
Can you have that skill
It turns out it's a romance
And you're very lucky tonight
You're very lucky just as I was lucky
When I first sat in greek
101 how lucky I was
I had no idea what was coming
I had no idea the things
It would do to me
And how it would follow me
And after 30 plus years
Every day
Every day me and greek
We are in the kitchen
We're in the bedroom
We're in the office
Where are we not
Where do we not just rub it all
Over each other
You know what I mean
Oh god every day
Something new her mind
Is so expansive
Marilyn Manson
Did was he tapped into
That well
And was able to pull out
Those daimonase
Those what
Those daimonase
Those powers
Look at that word one more time
The pharmacomantis right
Who is that mantic
It is that person who knows
Who knows
Think about that for a minute
Just stop it's a combination
Of a drug and a seer
What kind of woman fits the bill
For that
Oh it's in the
Mind and antiquity I'm going to give you
A couple of concepts that we do not have
In anglo-saxon
Where is he
Frederick come here Frederick
You stupid
Oh god
Waiting till the drill instructor gets here
I'm going to love this
Go give me the next one
I want you to remember people
Pharmacon
We just talked about the pharmacomancy
What is the
You didn't realize that the religion
Was being generated by pharmacomancy
Oh my god
Montea through farmaca
Watch what is going
This is
I'm telling you what is in the air
And what these people are breathing
They are fumigating
I'm not going to do this the whole night
I just want you to see
Look at the second paragraph
In purple
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 lines down
In christo
You're going to see christo in there
You're going to see all sorts of christing
We are never going to be far
From the christing
Why would you bring it up now
We're going to go fast
This intro is fast
Here's your mantis people
Notice that it's the seer
Look at all the different seers
Apollo and Cassandra
Look at the second line
Seibula
The symbols that are painted
In the chapel
Oh god
Do you know where they come from
They come from here
They come from time
When people were saying
Who and what
Are the seer
And it turns out
The power is in the language
That they called the logos
In the beginning was
The logos
Mystery
It's all over
The greek language
The ancient greek
And what you're going to be lucky
To be able to do
Is to draw from wells
That have not been accessed
Oh god
This is all frontier
It's gorgeous
Absolutely gorgeous
You're going to love it
I'm slowing things down
Look at this people
I just want to see that
In christ station
He's there
Bring him back
What is somebody who's
Pharmacost
That's knowing many drugs
And in the greek
The next word is
Who are the eaitroi
Those are those who
Those are the healers
Right
And we have healers
As women earlier than any other
Profession
Looks like
They got all the brains early on
Somebody told me that
Somebody told me that recently
Your Y chromosome is malfunctioning
Right
Something happened
What is this
Pharmacost
I wanted to introduce you to greek
Before I give you the drill sergeant
Because I want you to see
The greeks have a word for somebody
Who knows a lot about drugs
In an intimate kind of way
Given
To the use of drugs
Look who's the author there
Gailin
That's gailin
That's a medical text
Do you know
When the head of my committee told me
The romans
With reference to recreational drugs
The romans just wouldn't do such a thing
It was text like this that I thought
Have you never read
Have you not cracked
These works open
Oh my god
I'm sorry
All going
Look at number three
Of countries
Abounding and healing or poisonous herbs
And what country is that
Turenia
Do you know who those people are
They're what we call the Etruscans
What are the Etruscans known for
And you're not going to see this
You go all the way to Italy today
You can get in a taxi
And cross your fingers
And hold on
And you can get to that Etruscan site
Right from Rome
You're there
And at that Etruscan site
You will never know
That the people who were there
Were known for all their drugs
Were known for their drugs
Do you know how many words in Greek there are
For altered mental state
My god
My god
The Etruscans
It makes sense because the Etruscans
Were buddies
With the Pulascians
Yeah
So it only makes sense
We know those Pulascians everywhere they go
They're spreading the drug cult
The earliest one
Is on Samothrace
Right
We talked about it
You and I are tracking the cults baby
We're going
This is not nobody's brain
Do you know why
Because nobody works with these tags
And
What I find so beautiful is
You are going to give me an opportunity
To
Give you
Access
To those same texts
So that you can have your eyes
Opened
So that you can see what it was
The Etruscans are there
You may walk into one of their tombs
And see all the goofy stuff
And say oh god these people were high
You may do that
But you won't know
How accurate you actually are
Oh god
There's so much
Let's go give me the next one
I love this
Look at this
Did we get diamond
We're supposed to get diamond first
Oh I missed the order up here
Boom and the next one
Boom and the next one
Just go on the next one
Oh god, next one
Look at that, here we go
No, not here
Oh my god
Look this sergeant's going to be so mad
Boom, okay
Well here's the definition of diamond
What
The LSJ will provide you
And Henry Little
Right as a little Scott
Oxford Lexicon
He was the father, please everybody know this
He was the father of Alice in Wonderland
Yeah
The Alice from Alice in Wonderland
Her father
Was working on putting
Together what I'm flashing up
In front of you
And his student
John Johnson
And Chuck changed his name
To Lewis Carroll
Oh wait a minute
Were there dragons in those days
I think there were dragons
Here we go
What does this word diamond mean
It's a power or a capacity
Demon, it's our word for demon
Somebody asked me what is a god
Okay we'll start with demon
What is a demon or a
Diamond, a diamond is a power
And one of its definition is that of
Daemon, it's the same thing
It's something that is
Knowing, so you can have a daemon
Mahes, and that is
Somebody skilled in battle
Skilled in fighting
Right, it means skilled
Or knowing, those demons
What are they, they're known
Now you're going to stop, what I want you to do
Stop all your preconceived notions
Of demons, I'm just going to
Lay it out for you, what the reality was
That never existed, unfortunately
Most of what you
Know
Is an unreality
The attainment of Greek
Is the reconnection
With the real
And it brings renaissance
And so that's why I'm happy
And privileged to have
Such a great audience
My god, there's almost a thousand of you
How much honor do we owe these people?
How much honor?
Look at this people, daemon
What's a daemon, what's it
Knowing or experienced
Right, somebody who is knowing
Or experienced in something, next one
Next one
Boom
From the verb da, oh now
This is what they said in antiquity
That this
Term daemon, this noun daemon
Was derived from the verb
Like many many
The overwhelming majority
Of ancient Greek words
They're derived from the verb
And I want you to think about that
I want you to think about that
The difference between a verb
And a noun
That's the dyad
That they've got in grammar
You mean they're talking about
Dyads and monads
And grammar?
Yeah, you know why?
Logos
Logos
Reckoning
Computation
Oh god, that's getting me excited
Learn, right?
To learn, dao, what is dao?
To learn, right?
Or to learn isn't to teach
I'm going to learn you something
You know what I mean? Watch this though
Dio is also a potential
For candidate for this root
That this word is from
Means to burn up or to consume
To consume
The seeds of fire
What she possesses
Uh-huh
Baptism
By fire. Does anybody understand that expression?
Nope, you don't
You haven't seen the real one
I'll show it to you. Are you ready here
To burn up? Give me the next one
Oh god, what is the daemon?
I'm burning, I'm knowing
What am I? This is the other thing
Look, it's haemon
Haemon
And what does that mean? It means to be
Eager
To be eager for something
And they show you the victorians
They said look, it equals daemon
For daemon
Okay, okay
I'm starting to get it. I'm starting to feel the daemon
That blood at the bottom
I'm going to have to put that
That old word haima
Originally means blood
And or semen
Blood
And or semen
So what that has to do
With an eager knowledge
Is going to have to be something that you
Steal upon
Yes
Then you can stand on the sand with the beast
Do you understand?
Then you go, okay, no
Of course, let's go. Hurry up, the drilling structure is waiting
Um, look at the fadamaka here
Oh god, I wanted you guys to see the
Fadamaka and the Alexa Daddy
Of that antidote
Um, lots of, oh god
The works of, oh
All right, this is, all right
You're in for a treat
You're in for a treat, so I'm glad
That we're going to go ahead and get started
And what I need to do now
Is I'm going to want you to put the text on there
And I'm going to call in the drill instructor
Wait a minute, did I have a
Oh, I'll save that for the ending
I'll give you a little something at the ending
It is a
It is a verse
From the
Hebrew
Writings that were
The translation of the original
Greek writings called the Septuagint
And it is
Laughably, if anybody
Is denying me
Is saying, no, no, no
This man is lunatic, I've got the hardest
Core evidence just to show you
The fact that the Greek
Is aiming for
And achieving a much higher level
Of technical expertise
And the Hebrew is a very simple
Very low vocabulary
Very third grade
Reading
So, but that's the best that you
Can do with that Hebrew
I'm going to show you an example of that
But I'm going to flash your textbook up here now
And what I'm going to do
Is I'm going to grab
The drill instructor
And I'm going to meet myself
And just give me a minute here
Look at your textbook
However you can get this textbook
Please feel free to
I don't know
To find whatever ways necessary
People have been telling me
Amen
Thank you for giving
Everybody an opportunity
To be able to
Enter this
Well, you know, it's the
Request and the devil
Telling me, dude, you can't
You've got to make this available
For everyone, right?
You've got to really
You want to really undercut
Get down to the
Nitty gritty and pull up that
Renaissance, you've got to do this
So, I appreciate it
I'll be back in 30 seconds
Thank you
It's nice to meet you
I'm your drill instructor
Let, before we begin
Let me tell you who you are
And then I'll tell you who I am
Okay
You are the downtrodden
You are the slaves
Of your Anglo-Saxon
Crappery
You have come here
To make yourself
You have come here
To make yourself
Something better
You've seen some honor
And you've been attracted to it
You've had some thirst
And it's drawn you
And you want this
You really, really want this
You will succeed
Because of who I am
Who am I?
I'm your instructor
And I've been working with this language
For 30 plus years
Humbly every day
You're going to come in here
With certain preconceived notions
Some of you will come in here
With seminary work
By the way, welcome
Welcome to all the monists
It's nice to have you
And it's a privilege
And an honor to teach you
Greek
You'll come in here
With certain preconceived notions
You will think that you know
Certain things
Everybody comes in here
With an attitude
An attitude
Leave your arrogance
At the door
Leave your brain
At the door
I don't need your thoughts
And you don't need your thoughts
You're not going to thank your way
Through push ups and pull ups
You're just going to do
If you want to master
The language
The rest of you can sit
You're allowed to
Sit and watch
There's things I'd like to say
That you're allowed to do
This is very serious
You are a slave
And this
Training
The Bacchic reality
Is liberty
Celebrity
Oh God
Oh God
Now if you want to get there
You're going to have to listen to me
You're going to have to do exactly what I say
There are influences here
That you will not understand
You and I fight
Against principalities
And powers
That's a good thing
There are high places
No
We're in a struggle
We will soon
Lose
Our liberty
There are people
Who want to stop
Just something as
Simple as this class
There are people who want to stop that
I was notified today
There are people who want to stop it
Why would you want to stop it?
Because we are in the vanguard
I can tell you
This information
It will bring you to a place of honor
Now
If you want to be
Where Sappho was
If you want to be
Where Lord Byron was
Maybe where Thomas Jefferson was
If you want
To inhabit the same cosmos
That they did
This is the tool
This is the tool
And you're going to have to listen
To what I say
It is my job
To get you through the obstacle course
It is my job
To get you to a point
Where you can use the skill
For yourself
It will take 24 sessions
Now
You can take them at your pace
But if you're going to go from one
To two
You better be ready
You better do what I say
Your very first instructions
Will be the most basic
Rule number one
Don't think
Don't think you can't
English speaking
French speaking
Italian speaking
Spanish speaking
Polish speaking
Brains
Russian speaking
Arabic
Hebrew
Modern
Throw them all in there
Because they will never
Even Chinese
Chinese
100,000
Unique words
100,000
Ancient Greek eats that for lunch
Somewhere between
500,000 and 1.5 million
It's off the chart
So this is what I can bring
To you
Take your brain and shut it off
Because it's functioning in a world
Of 100,000 words
The big deal is
You
Will be able to
Create
Logos
You
And there's the magic
But you're not going to get to that place
Unless we listen
To each other
And I have to be really strict
I'm going to show you exactly what
To do
Are you ready?
Hit me with them all
You're going to
Over the next week
You're going to get real familiar with something
You're going to get real familiar
With letters
There's 24 plus 1
Invisible 1 I want you to learn
And I know you've never used
An invisible letter
Did you know you could use invisible letters
With your words?
It explains a lot
It explains why Saturn
Is satan
Yeah, neat
This is alpha
What I want you to do is get in bed with the curves
Get in bed
Learn it
Alpha first letter
Second letter
Beta
Look at those
Look at the curvaceous forms on that beta
Whatever it takes for you to memorize this
Alphabet I want you to do it
And guess what pronunciation we're using
Guess what pronunciation we're using
We're using that
Which I was taught in the United States
West of the Mississippi River
In the 20th
That's what we're using
We're not going to use the original
Because the original Greek
Was accented
Via tone
Right? Oh god
Had a pitch accent to it
And what are you going to do? We don't have that
Address accent speakers
We are marching in a single line
The Greeks are not
Let me blow your brain
Are you ready for this?
Verbs
Have one type of accent
Nouns have another
Yeah
Nouns
Attempt to retain
Where their accent is
When the end of the word changes
They attempt to keep the same spot
Verbs, they don't care
They adjust
They're the machines of the language
That adjust
And you're going to start using them that way
I thought I just over my mouth
Had just stuff run out
Yes, you do
Because you're raised under the slavery of English
People are always asking me
How is it in ancient Greek
You can read six lines
And not get to the main verb
Until the end
In other words, you can't solve
What's going on
Until you've seen the end
Right?
Think about this for a minute
Ancient Greek
I'm not talking modern Greek
That stuff they found in northern Turkey
That's a descendant
A close descendant of
Koine Greek
Hellenistic Greek
Modern Greek is
It's not related to modern Greek
It's very foreign to modern Greek
So what is the modern Greek
It doesn't matter
I don't want to offend
We can put the Anglo-Saxon speakers
We can put the French
And the Celtic tongue
We can put all those things
In one giant container
Because none of them
Historically reached
What the Greek did
Okay, let's get into
That next letter
Gamma
What am I giving you people
I'm giving you the capital letter
On the left
And the tiny one
On the right
And what are you going to do
Look at those shapes again
It's two strokes
Left and down
Right and down
Two little strokes
Gorgeous
I want you to memorize this
Look, it's got a tail to it
Oh, God
Sexy letters
Epsilon
Pretty straightforward
Ready for the next one
Zeta
Wait, what?
Yeah, yeah
I'm going to let you say Zeta
And we're going to pronounce it with a Z
Z
But you've got to realize this is a combination
Right, D and S
Right
Oh, God
Look at this one, next one
Eta, I kind of have a thing for Eta
Right, look at the way
Look at the way that lowercase Eta
I mean, it looks like an H
But look at the lowercase
Oh, God
You're going to love that
It's got like a leg sticking out
Let me show you my leg
Give me the theta
Pretty straightforward people
And this font is pretty
Universal
This is a good font
Eota
Keep going, kappa
Look at the kappa, notice the kappa
And the lowercase looks like
Kind of an X
When you're looking at it, it kind of looks like an X
It's not, it's a kappa
You love that?
Next one, lambda
Look at lambda
You say, wait a minute
I see people with that on their shield
That's because
You're watching a bunch of laconians
Give me the mu
Look at the mu
Oh, again, crevaceous
That's callipigenus
That mu is callipigenus, give me the new
Look, it looks like a V
In English, yes
The new, which makes an N sound
Looks like a V
That may be confusing at first
But it'll wear off
Look at the next letter
Xe
Oh, this one
Look at that, look at the capital
And by the way, you know
You're asking yourself, what is the difference
In these styles?
Look at this letter Xe
This is the letter Xe, which is a kappa
And a sigma next to each other
X
You say this all the time
Right?
Look at that, licks
My cheek
Licks
Well, they just made a letter out of it
Right? And looking on the left
You see that capital
Look, it's just three bars
I can see through that
It's a long bar followed by a short bar
And underneath that's another long bar
Now, why do you think that difference is?
Because those, what we're calling
Lower case letters
Those are things that monks make up
Right? Those are things that people
Who want to write
Make up on
Parchment
Give me a skin
People are writing things on skins
There's a lot of skins, there's no books
There's no books, there's scrolls
There's scrolls and buildings
Full of scrolls called libraries
And shh, don't tell anyone
The Christians will burn them all down
If you want to check on that
Go ahead and check on that
Galen was complaining, but be quiet
Shhh
Look at the C
The left side is for stone
The right side is for
Parchment
Isn't that amazing?
You didn't know there was a different element
In those
Upper case and lower case letters, did you?
No, you didn't
Go, Omicron
Oh, it looks just like an O
Sorry, Omicron, but you're kind of boring
P
And don't say Pi
If you say Pi for this
I'm going to virtually punch you in the mouth
Yes
Psychically
What
What happened?
Don't say Pi, Pi is for nerds
Who study physics
Oh God, it's maybe some geometry
Maybe some geometry, but this is
P
P
Row
Wait a minute, I thought that one was a P
It was a P, this is a row
But that's an English P
That's because Anglo-Saxon speak
With rocks in their mouths
Give me the next one
Sigma
Sigma, when it's big
It can be that
Kind of
Grabby looking
And when it's small, look
When it's that first sigma
In this case, you use that internally
Okay, internally
In a word, in the middle of a word, you use that
Right, we're starting out
But if you're going to end a word
In a sigma, you've got to use the one that looks like
An S
It kind of looks like a snake thing
Good, how about Tao
Tao, oh God
A little bit curvaceousness
A little bit, just gets a little flirty
But you know, go
Upsilon
Ooh
Ooh, do you know what
Upsilon does? Upsilon hides a
Diagma
What? There's a letter called a Diagma
And the Upsilon hides it
When there's an Upsilon there, she's like
Ooh, come here, Diagma
Right, and that's how you can age
Words
You perverts
That's how you age words
I'm going to show you, you know who showed me
The guy who works for
The American intelligence
Naval intelligence
Cracking codes
In World War II
He also helped crack
Linear B
And he taught me
Where the Diagma hides
Wait a minute
Are we talking about the same thing?
Give me the fee
Roll out fee here, everybody loves fee
I don't know why, but everybody loves fee
Right, now if you say
Phi, I'm going to say
Fo-fum
I smell
The gas
Of an Englishman? Is that how it goes?
No, because that's your nursery rhymes
This is fee, people
Fee
Fee, fee, it makes a
Ph sound, love it
Give me the next one
This is not native
To England accent, but it's a he
Wait a minute, what?
Did he just hiss at me? Yeah, he did
Right, he
This is a he
Right, good, and
Another doublet here, nice following
The Psi
Not the Psi
The Psi
The Psi, and what does the Psi do?
It's a P
And a Sigma, together
Psst, that's nice
The word
Fultures
Gips
Okay
Omega
Omega, everybody knows what Omega is
This thing has been used
All over
All over for symbols
Oh god, if I had a
Omega
Give me the letter after Omega
Where's my diagram, did you hide my
There she is, boom
Boom, and finally
Those were 24 letters, you're responsible
For those, by next session
And what I need you to do
And please follow me
Exactly, stand in the shower
Sit on the toilet driving your car
Doesn't matter, Alpha
Beta, gamma, delta, epsilon
Zeta, eta, theta, eota,
Kappa, lambda, mu, nu, C
Omicron, P, rho,
Sigma, tau, Upsilon
Phi, he, Psi, Omega
That's how we're gonna say them
Please say them that way
And I need you to have the entire
Alphabet down
If you will follow
My instructions and this week
You will draw these out
Whatever it takes, my students say
There's lots of different ways
Right, I drew them out
When I was learning them
Okay, what it's gonna do
For your brain
The very imaging
Of those letters
Are symbols
That the language itself
Employs
Oh, can you believe that?
There's two layers
Of complexity here
We have the verbal meaning
Or association
And we have
The image produced
By the letter
You say, wait a minute
I didn't think people would do that
What do we have here? Di-gamma
Di-gamma, yeah
Like an F, it does
But it's pronounced like a W
Wa
Wa, give me the word
I'm gonna give you an example
I'm gonna start with this
Greek word
Wanasa
Now you say, wait a minute
It starts with an alpha
So how is
Wanasa? Because
There is a di-gamma
Hidden in there
Look people, take down
Look at the first word here
It says Wanasa
Wanasa, right
Okay, the queen lady
Addressed to goddesses
We don't have these anymore
I'm sorry to say, they died
They died, the last one was like
500 AD
Yeah, they died
It's a shame, I'd like to have them back
Is there any way to get
These women back?
Okay, go to the next one
Boom
I wanna go through a word list
I wanna go through a word list
We can work backwards
That's fine, you're gonna go up from here
Are you ready? We're starting at the end of the alphabet
We're looking at the first letter
And this word is
Okeanos
Okeanos
Notice the accent
Is that little slash above
The omicron
Second to last letter
The only thing you're gonna do with that accent
Is you're gonna stress it
You're gonna spend twice as much time on it
Are you ready? The proper
Pronunciation is
Okeanos
Okeanos
It's not
Okeanos
And it's not Okeanos
It's Okeanos
You're putting a little extra time
On that syllable
Where the stress accent is
Here's another one
Next letter behind
Drunken driving
And they're making us go through the alphabet
We're having to do it backwards
Psy
Psy is the first letter
Psyche
Oh, by the way, what do people think
Okeanos is?
Ocean
You mean my concept of ocean
It comes from this language
You write it
Many, many, many of your words
We're stolen from it
Again, I'm sorry, it's just superior
We didn't borrow any ancient Persian
There's a reason for that
Greeks were right there
They could have
Functionality
It turns out, just like in nature
It's survival of the fittest
With languages
God, this language is so fit
Look at that Psy
Psyche
This is the word for soul
In English, we get psychology
Psychology
Good, go to the next one
Philosophia
Philosophia
I had one instructor from Arizona
Tell me
This is really an aspirated P
So it should be pronounced
Philosophia
But 99% of the classes
Pronounce Philosophia
Okay, shout out
To that one learner
Humnos
What is a humnos?
It's a hymn
It's a hymn
There are two marks over the
Upsilon that starts this word
The first is a rough breathing
Rough breathing
Only the things that I say
Do you need to learn
It is a rough breathing
And it means you add an H
To that vowel
So this is humnos
Humnos
Not humnos
But humnos
And what is that? It's a song
You mean when I sing hymns
In English
I want you to notice that the English
That was stolen from this
Starts with an H
Why? Because it's the Greek rough breathing
It's an aspiration
Love it
That's the end
Look at the towel that starts
That towel
Keep going up
Now that row
That's on the front of this
I want you to put a little
Trill on it
You don't have to put a ton
Oh god
It's got a rough breathing
You've got to put a little puff of air
Oh, you little puff of air
And make your tongue go up and down
Something's going on here
This is something musical
Riza
Riza
And what is a Riza?
It's a root
It's a root
And look, here's some purgative medicines
Look what I brought you tonight
You can purge yourself with these roots
You know what I mean? Because sometimes
Sometimes you don't want to stop up the pipes
You need the stuff to keep going
Right?
Well, you've got roots
And you've got root cutters
What do we get in English? Of course, Rhizome
Rhizome, right?
Go back up, keep going up
How about this?
Omicron orchestra
What is an orchestra?
You're gonna say, oh, I know, I know
It's orchestra in English
And it is, but it isn't
Right?
What is an orchestra in antiquity?
It's a place where you dance
It's a place where you dance
Okay
You mean they danced?
Yeah, it's religious
Celebrations, right?
When you go to the tragedy
To be purged
Don't you think you ought to
Be able to enjoy a chorus?
Not like a tragic chorus, man
I had one at St. Mary's
It was a chorus of furies
And they were dressed absolutely
It was gorgeousness and
Gorgeousity
All wrapped up into one
It was black
It was leather
And it was fury
Just the, you know
Dilda waving fury
Yeah, Mad Max
Kind of style
Loved it, loved it
Yeah, stood for the value
The Montseignee said, this stands for the values
That we should uphold
Ksenos, what's a Ksenos?
That's a stranger
Now look, this word
Is actually really neat
This will show you a little bit
Of the history and I want you to hear this
Please hear this, are you ready?
Ksenos, Ksenos
What is a Ksenos?
That's the dude
That you are obliged
To give a bath to
And some food to
And a bunk to stay the night
Yeah, wait what?
Is that a
Yeah, no, this is a legal thing
And it's protected by the cult of none other
Than Zeus himself
Yeah
And they call this thing
This magical thing
Okay, you have an obligation
Dude shows up to your door at sunset
And he's like, look, I've been walking
For the last eight hours
And I need a place to stay for the night
You have a religious obligation
To give him a room
And you're supposed to give him a gift too
Right now, here's the thing
He goes back to wherever he's going
He leaves his information with you
And when you're traveling
You have a right to stay with him
Why? Because you
Have a relationship
Called Xenia
Oh yeah
Oh god, now
That's giving you a little bit
The words will give you the
Dust that was in the air of antiquity
Xenos, we got a few more goodies here
Nektar
Do you want to drink some Nektar?
You know that looks like nectar in English
Look how stupid we are in English
Can we not invent a word
That was the equivalent of nectar?
Seriously?
No, we'll just steal it from them
Because what do they do?
What did Anglo-Saxon speakers do?
What did the Angles and the Saxons
Did they always sit around
And they probably just hunted and stuff
You know, come on people
There's nothing wrong with hunting
Greeks hunt too, but do something with your language
Nektar
So gorgeous
That's what the gods drink
Now wait a minute, I thought I just told you at the beginning
That God was a combination of drugs
And vision
Yeah, you know how you get there? Nectar
You know what the Greeks said?
Listen to how drug using this
Culture is
They said that nectar
Is what gives the gods
Their immortality
That is the source
You mean there's drugs that give immortality?
Yes
Salvation comes
Through drugs
People, there's 1200 of you
Thank you for your time
Salvation is through drugs
In the ancient world
When I say salvation
I mean everything
I mean medicine
I mean the salvation you're thinking of
I'm thinking psychological salvation
Same thing
Salvation through drugs
Christ is a drug term
Now you see
Who you are
You have no idea
What kind of person you are
You have no idea what kind of life you're leading
You're in the dark
And that
Is what Greek is here for
Greek is to bring the light
Greek
Will bring you the light
Not me and my stupid ideas
I want to pause here
I'll let Amos say that when he comes
No, I'll say it for him
I want to recognize
I want you to recognize tonight
This is not for profit
I am not selling this
I have enough
Subscribers now
That I could sell this
Only I can't
Because the contract
Doesn't last
It's broken
The minute you make
Something from it
The minute you prostitute it
It loses its value
The minute you're doing it to keep your job
It loses its value
The devil was like
Don't do that, so look people
We are here, Hail Satan
We are here
Because of that principle
Do you know how novel that is?
Okay, let me just ask you this question
Those of you
Who don't know who you are
Because I know a lot of you are sitting there
I know who I am, this guy's
He's just playing philosophy
Okay, hang in there
Hang in there smarty
Let's see what happens
When your consciousness is cracked open
By the Greek
Let's see what happens
You run
Oh god, I lost it
Let's go to the next one
Look what that person did
Look at that first letter people
It's a mew
You hear that time I hit the accent
Me metikos
Not me metikos
Not me metikos
It's me metikos
And the Greek wants to
Accent itself on one of the last
Three syllables
The last three syllables
You're going to see that's where that hangs around
And originally that is pitch up
It's pitch up
It's very musical
Greek is very musical
Boom, well me metik
Is to mirror
Is to mirror
And here's the word everybody thanks they know
But they do not, it's logos
It starts with a lambda
And what is the logos
The logos is your reckoning
Your calculation
I thought it was word
It is
Because a word
Is a reckoning
A
Reason
Give me a reason
And I've got
Logos
You see
Another thing you don't know
Is the word
Logos
Another thing you don't know
You're going to know now
Is that
The quantum
Reality
Is
The result
Of the logos
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Let's give you some pre-socratics
These are the people
You're going to sit in the future
You're going to sit with people
That you know you can't hold a candle to
That's what I love to bring the smarties in
Because in every class
There's going to be some smartie
Who thanks they know everything
And it's so beautiful to humble them
I used to spank seminarians
Mentally spank them
I love it
Don't challenge me
I'll spank you
Don't ask me to spank you
Okay, that's too much
Kinema
Kinema
Think of the word
Kinesthesia
Anything, any of the kin root
Right, it's the movement
Movement
Kinetic
Think of kinetic force
Hit the next one
Historia
Now you think you know what history is
This is where we get history and English
From
Historia
That's a question
What kind of question is it?
Originally it's a question that you propose
To an oracle
Imagine this
Imagine this
You're living in a world
Where
You recognize that you can put somebody
Into a death state
You can bring them out of it
And they can have experienced
Something
That will guide them
They will have an understanding
That is outside
Of time
And when you get that understanding
That's outside of time
You can pass that on
To other people
Who don't travel
And so they imagine
You live in that world
And you can go see one of these travelers
You can go see her
And you'll be like what?
She's a teenager?
Yeah
What do you think?
The most excellent vessel
For the god
To possess
You want the top
She's got to know everything
She's got to be the one who knew
That geometry
It's gorgeous
The poetess runs everything
Yes
She runs everything
Do you know what Historia means?
It means to ask the Oracle
A question
And when you go to the Oracle
What kind of question?
What do you think people go to ask them?
Do you think people go to ask them anything?
Where did I misplace my car keys?
Let me go to the Oracle
It's going to take me six days to get there
Yeah
No
You're going to that Oracle
That comes from being taken
Out
Of time
Out of
Chronos
That's who you are
When you are born again
You are taken from
Chronos
Now
Those of you who get the physics of that
Good for you nerds
Next one up
Theatron
The place of viewing
Where do you get vision?
You get vision in a theater
I went to New York
I lived in Bayonne
I went to New York
I took in
What is that?
It's a famous place
Made a big impression
Obviously
I took in stage
And I can tell you for a fact
I enjoyed it and I was entertained
But I was not inspired
Nor did I have vision
You got to remember
We're fumigating these people too
We're fumigating them
To induce these
Purgative
Visions
Jesus Christ
Is walking around with the same
Face paint
That the Balkans have
Yeah
Why?
Mystery operation
And that mystery is tied to drugs
Give me the next one
Boom
Paleosis, the sun, look at that
Ada that's on the front of that
Gorgeous, keep going
We've got to hurry up
These people came here for the reality
Zoe
Oh, that's life
And if you capitalize that
That's her
I just want you to stop for a second
Zoe
When I make that noise, Zoe
What is that?
That's life
That's life
And she
She is everything
Everything in the mystery
Revolves around
Zoe
Did you know
What the Septuagint
Calls Eve
Because Eve is not a name
Eve is a shout
It's a balkan cry
Her name was
Life
It's not interesting
It was only the devil
It was only the devil that gave her the fruit
It was only the devil
He's like, no
God's a liar
Love it, it's locked in the language
People, give me the next one
Hexagonos
Who wants a hexagon?
Oh, my God. Okay, next one
Look at these people, dimoniao
What does it mean to dimoniao?
You see the root demon on there
That we just looked at, right?
Dimoniao
It's a verb
That is, it's an action or a state of being
Dimoniao
I am going to wake up tomorrow
And dimoniao
Or maybe
If it goes down, I should dimoniao
It means
To be possessed
By a dimon
By a power
By
A skill
A knowledge
Did Socrates say he had a dimon?
Yeah, he did
Yeah
Are dimones good things?
Yeah, they are
Your conception of a dimon
Is completely off
Completely
Interesting
Yeah
Yeah
Those fallen messengers
Are always the ones to bring you the facts
Those fallen messengers
So how do we translate this?
People think about that
Am I going to wake up in the morning and demonize?
That's how we're going to have to translate that
With a word, demon
Taken from that word
This is going to bring us perfectly right
Keep going
That's any kind of writing
Look at the gamma up front
Gamma
Up
Look at the next one, go
Biblion
Does this mean book?
No, because they're not using books
It means scroll really
But it's the concept that you have in your brain
When you're thinking about what a book is
Yeah, it's just there in different forms
They got parchment, they got animal skin
All that kind of stuff
Good, up finally
Alpha starts us off with
Anthropos
Anthropos when we get anthropology in English
And it just means human being
It just means human being
Anthropos
What's the study of anthropologies?
The study of humans, dude
Okay, now at the bottom
I want to give you these last
I had those things special for you here
Okay, people
I want to give you flash up here text
Then I'm going to give you instructions
What to do
I'm going to flash up here this text
You come back to this if you want
You stop it, you come back
But look at this
Verse number four
Verse number four
Where is this from?
Zechariah
Verse number 12
In that day
It says
What happened at that time?
Legge Curios Pantocrator
The all ruling
Lord
Said what?
Patakso
Pantahipa
What's going to happen?
He's going to strike Patakso
What am I going to strike him?
I'm going to strike him in
Ecstasy
Now here for those of you
Who are trying to follow
You're not supposed to be able to at this point
I'm just exposing you
Does it feel good?
Now look at verse number four
Look at the second line
It's one, two, three, four, five words in
That's
Alpha, Sigma, Tao
Alpha, Sigma, Epsilon, Yoda
Don't say Iota
If you say Iota
I don't know what's going to happen
I'm going to lose it
Don't say Iota
I'd say Iota as well
E plus Yoda
I'll take that too
Just don't say Iota
What am I going to do?
I'm the all ruling
Lord, what am I going to strike every horse
In ecstasy
You hear ecstasy
In English because
It's where we stole the concept of ecstasy
From him. He's going to strike the horse
He's going to place the horse
In ecstasy
And what else is he going to do?
Ton anabatin autu
In parafronese
He's going to put
The rider of that horse in a state
Of parafronesis
What is parafronesis?
Give me that definition
Watch this people, the technicality
Boom, this is the word
First word I want you to think about
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me the next one
Parafronese
Again, the date of
What are
And I'll tell you later what those mean
That's how the ending of the word is changing
Don't worry for now. All I want you to see
This thing starts with a P
And I'm not going to say pie. It's a P
Watch this people
What is ecstasy? Give me the definition
Oh my god
Displacement
Greek, ancient Greek
Displacement
A standing
Away or outside
Of what is normal
Number two, distraction
Of mind
Distraction of
Mind plus a little bit
Of intransmit
Intransmit
Okay
Do you understand what ecstasis
Is?
Ecstasis and some preacher
Will stand up and say this is from
The prefix ec and history
Me
Yeah, shut up
Watch how the word transforms
Give me the next one. That's ecstasis
Now what is the Hebrew?
Because this is translated
Into Hebrew
What does the Hebrew give us
For ecstasis?
It gives us this
Dhamma
To be astounded
Or dumbfounded
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Ecstasis
Is not this
Because there is a great concept
For this it's Dhammadzo
And if you believe
The BS
Story that's been handed down to us
That this was originally Hebrew
And then translated into Greek
The Greek translator just missed
Something
Extremely obvious
Extremely, either the Greek translator
Is terrible, or the original
Greek was rendered into a much
More simplistic Hebrew
Form that couldn't
Carry the technical capacity
In other words, ancient Hebrew
Got no word for ecstasy
Sorry
To be astounded
Or dumbfounded
Now give me the other ones
What is paraphernesis?
What is paraphernesis?
Let me see the definition first
Whoops, no, that's not
Paraphron
Paraphron
Right?
Look in the parentheses, you see
The main is that mind, right?
What is that wandering
From reason?
Paraphron is to be
Beside your reason, to be standing beside
Like if you could take your reason out
Of your body and
Stand there
That's what you're entering into
When you are paraphrenetic
Now look at that, I just made an English word
That doesn't exist
Paraphrenetic
To stand outside
Yourself
I like that
Your own wits, right?
What they do in the Hebrew with this
What they do in the Hebrew with this
It's a huge concept, the frame is huge
What is this? To be mad
That's a little simple
That's a little simple and off
Technically, because look what kind of madness
They're doing, again, look at how
Third grade it is
Madman, behaving as a madman
Demented, driven mad
It's like clinical madness
It's like clinical madness
The only problem is
Both of those Greek words are associated
With mantic
Powers
What are mantic powers? The ability
You can take it out, the ability
To stand in the
Ion
To stand in the Ion
To see outside of
Time
Outside of time, give me the next one
What is something
That's monikos
It has
That
Mania, right?
That has to do
With inspiration
Right?
It has to do with inspiration
Look at the second
Roman numeral number two
Frenzied
And number two, frenzied, enthusiastic
Inspired
Right? Notice it's
Aristotle
It's philosophers
Defining
That's where we're getting these definitions from
A lot of it
And that's the beauty of
Alice's dad and what he did
And look at the bottom
Just for those of you who
Never believed me
When I tell you that
These things have to do with drugs
Look at number three at the bottom
It can cause madness
And we find that
In diascortes
Notice at the end
It's
Pharmaca
Let's see
The drugs
That induce a state
Where you are visionary
Visionary
And
Off your
Out of sync
Normal
Prophetic
Right? Do you see how many drugs there are?
I couldn't get through half of these definitions
Without a whole bunch of drugs in them
Okay, what are my instructions
Class-wise
For everybody here
You heard me pronounce all of those
I want you to learn the alphabet
That's all I want you to do
What? That's easy
No, it's not
You have to have it
At a point in your brain
Where you don't have to think about it
And that's important
Because you're going
To be working with letters
And you've got to know what the
Order of the alphabet is
So you can be looking words up
So you can be finding words
You're going to have to know
That order
It's very important
Please become intimate
Until next Wednesday
With that
Alphabet
Please be able to
Say it forwards
Be able to say it forwards
And there is a great key
In your text
There is a great key
In the front of the introduction
Right? Or unit one
Is it unit one? Sorry
Introduction
Of course it's the introduction
There's a great key in there
I want you to see
How the words are
How the letters are pronounced
When you put two vowels together
They form a different sound
Alpha
By itself is a
Yoda by itself is i
Put them together and they're not a
I
I
Okay
Good
By themselves Omicron
Upsilon
Is it
Do you hear the diagama
Just a little bit
Love it
Don't worry about the diagama
It's not in your textbook
I'm going to show it to you every once in a while
Creeps out every once in a while
If you will be done with the alphabet
Commit it and I know that doesn't sound like a lot
And people are going to tell me
I want to go faster
No, no, no
We can pile these on top of each other
But here starting off
I want you to take the time
To be able to recognize
All of those letters
That's all we're retuning
Retuning your letters
That's all
Please for the next week keep that up
And when we begin next week
I will know
That you will have read unit one
Today is different
Because we're doing introduction
When you read unit one
You'll find that there are
Exercises
At the end of the book not drills
I don't want you to do drills
I want you to do exercises
And if you do
Four, five, six
Exercises before coming
You'll be in good shape
If you don't do any
Come to next Wednesday's session
And you can advance yourself
Because what I will do
Is I will present all the grammar
And I will present some readings
And I will give you every time
Some drug, some kind of
Terrible act that involves
Some kind of forbidden
Fruit
Every time I'm going to give it to you
Okay, but in order to get there
We've got to go step by step
Please read unit one
For next week
And remember
You can
Find God
It's the drug
That's the God
Hail Satan
In the sky
The Irish witch can fly
Madea's got the heavy weight
How much you want to buy
Scorpion venom
Molecustaceans
Dragon venom vaping
You know they might be taping
They want the L-M-N-O-P's
For the darkest of dreams
Lady Madea
She's coming to see you
Go on challenge a train venom
High purple Vine 211
Glutia hit you with a ticket to heaven
Open trends, bring you back from the dead
Go on challenge a train venom
High purple Vine 211
Glutia hit you with a ticket to heaven
Open trends, bring you back from the dead
Lady Babylon
Word won the bid
It's how it is
With the poisonous kiss
She never miss
Catch you in the sacred drift
Catch you in the twist
Thanks for watching!
