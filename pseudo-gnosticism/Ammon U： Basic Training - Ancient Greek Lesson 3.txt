Do you like the hash?
I got the creeper reefer
We eat spaghetti for silly hours
Assassin
With the fruit and veggies out the corner
Corbina
Here, have a little taste
Sipping wine, iron flavor
I got the bag of amethyst
Don't bring up
Group cutter
New singer
Athena Lover
Got the lavender by the box full
Overrigga Tony coming through
High off the contact
It sounds nice
Fruits and labor all night
The moon rise
Dragon Queen taking flight
I spun away from the tree line
Hip-hop will make you feel fine
House of Frankenstein
Wolfman
Chimetime
Group cutter
Don't bring up
Phoenix Rising
That's how the devil rides
Don't bring up
Group cutter
New singer
Athena Lover
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
This is almond you tonight
And I'm gonna give you plenty of time
With your instructor tonight
I'm going to bring him on in a minute
But what I want to do is warm you up
And I want to say thank you for
Your continued attention to
Ancient Greek, it's very important
Very important
Eye-opening, enlightenment stuff
And tonight we're gonna do that
But in order to get there
We've got to start somewhere
That you're not gonna want to be
Where are we going?
We're going to the back alley
We're going to that place
Where people get seduced
They get seduced
Mmm
I want you, Satanic congregation
To be impervious
To the seduction of the fairy tale
I want you to be so rooted in reason
People have to give you a coat
Like a scientist
Call you Melvin
Listen to me very carefully tonight
We're gonna look at an example
Of how you can be taken into the back alley
It's very easy
And let's all stay together
Come on, let's don't get anybody
Get lost out there
This is a scary, scary place
Alright, I'm gonna hit you with the clip first
And I want you to look at this clip
And I want you as classical philologists
To realize your place is a place
Of examining evidence
You are investigators
You examine evidence
None of us care about arguments
Arguments are sold and bought
Evidence is what will take us to the history
So I want you to be listening for that
Go ahead
What did the Greeks want to do?
They wanted to destroy Judaism
That's why I say that when you think of Greek
Don't think of it as German
The reason why you would bristle the idea
That a holy book would be written in German
I don't need to tell you what happened 85 years ago
So Greek wasn't just another language
It was the enemy language
It represented everything that was vile
Everything that was ungodly
Moreover, bear in mind people may say
Well, the writers of the New Testament
They just were Greek speakers
Christians insist that the authors of the Gospels
And the letters the epistles found
In the Christian canon
Would divinely inspire
They're not just the recollections of evangelists
No, they were divinely inspired
By the Holy Spirit, by the Holy Ghost
Really, that means God inspired these people
To write in Greek
Did the Holy Spirit forget Hebrew and Aramaic
And there's a massive problem for the church
That's why there are books out
That when God began to speak Greek
They have to explain this away
It's a very big problem
Did the Holy Spirit speak Hebrew and Aramaic?
This is the difficulty
Do you hear how we're not looking at evidence, right?
We're scientists and we need to stand back
In order to understand history
We have to look at all the data that we've been given
That's history
And you and I are philologists
Our data is all that Greek
Now, the impression
This is the very...
This is the stealth
Of the whole creation of the fairy tale
People are speaking Hebrew and Aramaic
Fantastic, fantastic
I want you to keep that in mind
Because I'm going to show you something
We know that by this time
There was no spoken Hebrew
And I'll show you that in a second
So the Greek that is in antiquity
That is the language of literature
The Romans, you'd be proud of this
The Romans used to say the Greeks
Although they were conquered by us
They conquered us with that gorgeous, gorgeous hot language
It's right
So let's look for the data
Like in Hebrew, ancient Hebrew
There are only 8,000 unique words
In ancient Greek, somewhere around 1.5 million
Why the difference, right?
Chewie, hit us another star system, please
Yes, it's written in a language that's
Not just not Jewish, not Hebrew, not Aramaic
It's written in the enemy language
It's written in the ungodly language
The language of Hellenism
Everything that was ungodly
And most importantly
Most germane for us
Because you're a child of Hashem
You want to do the right thing
Like why are there these Greek ideas?
The idea of a demure
That Satan is the Lord of this world
In 2 Corinthians 4-4
It's the ideas that are conveyed in Christianity
That are Greek rather than Hebrew

Okay, did you get the pitch there?
Did you get the pitch there?
Anybody who wants to purchase or merchandise
Feel free
Now, the problem is
The things that we're not seeing
Is the very obvious
I want you to be on alert
Whenever someone starts talking
In generalities
Generalities don't stand up to
Even a decade of antiquity
You cannot say
These people do that at the same time
As those people do that
This is such a mixture of Mediterranean
And cultures from Asia Minor
Long, long, long histories
Languages galore
We're flooded with data
So we don't need to be making generalities
Be careful
When somebody says Bible times
Realize, oh, in Bible times
Something happens
Scientifically and linguistically absurd
It's absurd at its best
At its worst, it's intentionally deceptive
But it's something that monism does
Scholars hate this
And that's why classes don't treat the Bible
Because they know these are the guardians
Of the fairy tale
Are you ready for this?
I just want to hit you with a piece of
Get ready to reset yourself
And you're thanking
Are you ready? Let's just look at the facts
We're talking about Hebrew
In the first century
Let's see what we've got here
Give me the first facts
Watch this, people
You can find this on any old encyclopedia
What is Hebrew?
It's mostly related to Phoenician and Moabite
We don't have any more though
With which it is often placed by scholars
In the Canaanite subgroups spoken
In ancient times in Palestine
Now wait a minute, did you hear it
Start to creep in?
That was the creeper
In ancient times
What are you talking about?
There's 3,000 years of time
All over the western world
What are you talking about?
In ancient times
What happened?
Spoken in ancient times
In Palestine, Hebrew was supplanted
Uh oh, what are they recognizing here?
They're recognizing that Hebrew died
Hebrew was a small tribal language that died
And by the time it got to the level
Of being able to communicate itself
Greek came along and went
Squash!
Just like she did
Many, many, many other languages
Many other languages
The real irony
Is that the person that was just speaking to you
About Hebrew and about evil Greek
Their ancestors
Were Greek speakers
That's the irony of the history
It died out
Watch what happens people
Hebrew was supplanted by
And they propose Aramaic
Possibly
Funny, aren't they?
Was there any Aramaic?
No!
What's going on?
We're trying to explain
The facts that we've got
And the monists have to stick to a narrative
They have to
If the Old Testament is not Hebrew
Everyone's in big trouble
And God has a birthday
God has a birthday
Hit it, Chewie
Yahoo! Yahoo!
When's your birthday?
Everybody!
Happy birthday to Yahoo!
Happy birthday to Yahoo!
Happy birthday, Elohim Hashem Jovah
It was in the third century
Thank you, occult examiner and Chewie
For bringing us that, Jim
Watch what happens, people
This is in the third century
Notice that they say it's in the third century, right?
That's when we know it's gone
It was revived
Look what they say
The language was liturgical
How many times have I told you that?
How many times have I told you that?
We're talking about a language that was dead
Do you know who's talking about that language that was dead?
People talking in Greek
Now, granted
At this time
At this time
The world is being swamped
Swamped by the language
But something is happening to Mother Greek too
She is aging
She's aging and that should not be happening
We have things creeping into the language
And ultimately, we get this thing called coine
It's a coine from the Attic dialect
And it is corrupted
It's corrupted
It's being dumbed down
Its commonality is having to pay
For absorbing people who have not worked with Greek
Who are not born with Greek
Yeah, all sorts of cultures
All over the Mediterranean
They're having to absorb this
You see, when you learn history, you learn dates
You learn people's names and that garbage is useless
It takes away from the focus of the nature
That the Greeks were so focused on
The nature of language
The nature of language
Give me the next one
We're talking about natural beauty here
Watch this, people
Here's another little entry
Classical Hebrew
The Hebrew language is divided into four major periods
Now watch this, pay attention
Biblical or classical Hebrew
What is wrong with the commas?
This person does not understand commas
Until about the third century BC
Now, they're telling you Biblical Hebrew
Is that which goes up to the third century BC
But wait a minute
How many biblical texts do we have from this period?
Do we have the letters of Isaiah?
No
Do we have the Genesis of Moses?
No
Do we have anything?
No
You mean we have nothing of Biblical Hebrew?
Zero
Do you know why this article says
That Biblical Hebrew exists
Without having any documents
Written in that language
Imagine if I were to say, you know what
In my backyard, some people spoke a language
And it was called blah
And blah was so expressive
Show us some blah
I got no blah
Fill in the blank, people
This is not science
You cannot say the period when this language was spoken
If there are no remains of the language
Zero
Zip
Nada
Now, watch what they say here in that line
Until about the third century
In which most of the Hebrew Bible is written
Really?
It's written in this period
Give me some of it
Oh, you don't have any of it
That right there that you just read
We just read together
That is an illusion
That's an illusion
We are song and dancers
Do you know what we are?
We are singers and dancers
And we are singing and dancing here
Let's keep going
Now, what comes after it?
After it comes Mishnehik or rabbinic Hebrew
And you say, aha, there's the language
I've got the language right there
And amen is a fool
Look, they're speaking Hebrew
Written about 200 CE
What?
This form of Hebrew, look what's in the parentheses
When somebody takes you into the back alley
And they start saying funny things
Look for what's in the parentheses
What's in the parentheses here?
This form of Hebrew was never used among people
As a spoken language
What are these people speaking?
Greek
Why did Jesus?
What did Jesus speak?
Nobody spoke Hebrew
It had been dead for years
It did not have the stamina
God's tongue took a dive
Yes
Watch what happens here, people
So, from about the 6th to the 13th century
When many words were being...
Look, what are they doing?
Borrowing
Now, we're going to try to bring it back
We've got to revive this corpse
And what are we going to do?
Naturally, we're just going to use the words
That we're speaking natively
Greek, Spanish, Arabic
I don't know if these are the languages
Of the ungodly
I don't know
But scientific, do you hear how that's an argument?
You don't want to be bathed in arguments
You want the evidence, the science
Anybody here? This is a friggin' temple
To reason
The muse, my friend
Is the result
Of a process of creation
Everything around you
Is that nature
Isn't that fundamentally
Kind of mind-altering?
If you can't follow anything but science
Wow, think about that
You could almost never
You could almost never be led astray
No, no
Facts won't lead you astray
Go to the next one
One more of these
I'm going to call on the drill instructor
Lots of good news from him
The Hebrew of the Bible exhibits
Little dialectical variety
Now, this one's important
It seems like it's a side note
So all of these books that are in the Bible
You mean they don't have any dialectical differences?
Period, as if the same person wrote them
Yeah
As if one person or one group of people
Wrote this work
All these different books, the books of Moses
The prophets, the Psalms
They're all written by the same people
By one group at one time
In the third century
They left their fingerprints all over it
And what language did they have to use?
They had to use Greek
They had to use Greek
Because that's all they had
You cannot write a work
If you're not native
If you don't have that language inside and out of you
Yeah, you can't use the idiom
The idiom stains you
Watch, I'm going to show you a little idiom here in a second
Give me the next comment
This is fantastic
None of us is going to be deceived here anymore
None, no back alleys
We will stay
Tell me, teacher
We will stay the straight and narrow
Watch this, biblical Hebrew
In its widest sense, biblical Hebrew
First, the spoken language of ancient Israel
Furshing between 1000 BC
That's a nice, that's a right cap
Do we have a document from...
Of course we don't
1000 BC to 400 CE
It comprises several
Evolving and overlapping dialects
Look, it's almost like they don't have it
There's no scientific standards here
For their definitions
The phases of classical Hebrew are often named
After important literary works
Really, really
Like the Mishneh
Hebrew
Right?
A non-spoken language
Fantastic
Give me the next one
What is going on with this?
Israeli and Hebrew
Is it proposed?
Wait, is it proposed?
As soon as you hear proposed
That trench coat is coming off
Yeah, the trench coat
Look, you can expect it
Now you're in trouble
Don't be thinking, where's mom and dad?
No, you're done for
A proposed northern dialect of biblical Hebrew
Believed
Well, at least they're admitting
That this is not a matter of science
But a matter of faith
At least they're admitting that
Believed to have existed in all eras
Of the language
In some cases competing with it
Look at how incredibly contorted
And detailed is their belief
Right?
Seriously, is this the best your scholars can do?
Yes, yes
One for the scholars
One for the scholars
All you language scholars
You lazy people
Shame on you
Shame on you for abandoning the art
Go to the next one, Shuey
Quickly, quickly
I want to bring the sergeant
And here we go
One more
Look at this
Israeli and Hebrew, IH
Is a northern dialect
Now this one didn't say that
They don't have any of this
This fish doesn't exist
This is a hypothesized fish
Have you seen it?
Have you drawn it out?
Do you know where it has its young?
What does it do?
What environment?
No, no, no, no, that
This is an imaginary fish
This is an imaginary fish
Blow it up, Chewie
Blow it up
Proposed
Well, there, finally
Proposed as an explanation
For the various irregular linguistic features
Of the Maseridic texts
Now what are they talking about?
When you read the Bible
You are reading an English translation
Or a Spanish translation
You're reading a translation
Of the Maseridic text
And when is the Maseridic Hebrew text?
When is it invented?
It is invented in 1000
On Odomany
You mean we're not even a thousand
We're a thousand years off the mark
Yes, you meant to land
In the Sea of Tranquility
You landed on Mercury
Oh my God
My God
Biblical scholars, what is wrong with you?
Watch what happens
It competes with the alternative
Oh look, the irregular linguistic features
So we have the Maseridic text
But it's irregular
Why do you think they have problems?
You don't hear classes is talking about
You know what?
Homer, hey guys, irregular
No, no, no, no, don't play games
What's happening with your text, people?
It's falling apart
It competes with the alternative explanation
That such features are Aramaisms
Now look what they did
They so want to include something
That sounds legitimate
They're gonna pull an Aramaic
Aramaic is that substitute for reality
The reality that we need to understand
Is this stuff didn't exist in antiquity?
Do you know what was there?
Greek
And she was eating everybody up
The good news is that after Greek
Met its decline
Into the influences of the first
And centuries BC and AD
After she started to meet her client
A group of very enthusiastic people
You could call them, I don't know
A Satanic congregation
They came up
They came up with a method
They said we're gonna re-inject
The glory that was Athens
Do you remember all the evil things
That Hellenism is doing?
Like democracy?
Do you remember the real evil thing
That Hellenism gave birth to
In our history?
It's called democracy
Democracy
That comes through a language
And that language has the capacity
To make you aware
Do you know the science that the Greek teaches?
That science can put anybody
Anybody who's trying to take you into a back alley
Put it to shame
Put some to shame
Lady Justice is right there with her
Let's go to the next one
Watch this people
And then I'm just waiting
I'm gonna call on the drill and strike
10 minutes and I'm calling you
This is a Greek sentence
Lifted from Deuteronomy 7
Deuteronomy 7 too
And to make you aware
That Hellenism is
That Hellenism is
That Taxes
Now watch this on the second line
Hellenism is
Do you hear that?
Do you see what they're doing?
Now watch, he's gonna do it again
Do you hear what's going on?
It's something
Hellenistic grace particularly love to do
They love to take a verb
Because they're smarties, right?
They've learned how the language works
They've learned the mastery of how that causes you to grow
In your frame
In that place that you perceive
Causes you to grow
And you know they've gotten clever
And here's what we're gonna do
We're gonna take a verb
The action word
And we're gonna take a noun
The person, place, or thing
And we're gonna take those two things
The word, the verb, and it's gonna have this root
And then we're gonna take the same root
And we're gonna have the noun
Use the noun from that root
Right?
It's a little bit of repetition
That breaks up
It makes them remember this is musical
Right?
Lots and lots of non-musical languages out there
Lots of them
Like our stupid Anglo-Saxon
Right?
Speaking of Anglo-Saxons
Check out
Old Boy
Who is doing an outstanding service
By running around
Tracking down
Tracking down the purple
In his backyard
And going to some of these places
And talking
He was talking to someone
I'll give you a little bit of preview
I don't think he'd mind
Old Boy's gonna be looking at more purple
That they're still finding
Oh God
It's wonderful people
Who said the apocalypse
Who was that person
Who said this was gonna be impossible
To you
Naysayers
Let's go back to that verse
Let's go back to that verse
What does this verse say?
It brings up something
That I wanted to show you
The style
The style of this line
These lines
Is Greek
It's not only colloquial
It's cyan
It's stylistically Greek
Is the Hebrew able to keep this up?
No, of course not
Because the Hebrew is a translation of this
How are they supposed to invent words?
Oh God
If you've only got 8,000
You've gotta start inventing
It's the way it is
We do the same thing in English
Our Anglo-Saxon ancestors
They did the same thing
You borrow
Remember the Hebrew that we're talking about
In the Middle Ages
That they're trying to revive this dead corpse
What are they doing?
They're taking Greek
They're taking Spanish
They're pulling it all in
They're taking German
Right
Right, and by the way
By the way
You know what?
Let's stay above the Frey people
Let's keep ourselves
Let's keep ourselves in the dignified zone
I think we'd all like that
I think we'd all like that
Give me the next one
We're gonna fly through a couple of these
I just wanted you to see
Here's that Afanismos
And I want you to see
We've got a little bit of creepage in our definition
Because remember
The editors
There's a whole bunch of editors
To the Oxford Greek lexicon
And they will group
They will do something
That you saw that guest
Our guest speaker today
That you saw him doing
There is a difference
What they do is they say
Look, they're a monist
And then there is the culture
In which monists live
And the monism
Creates this barrier
Where you don't know what your neighbor is doing
You know, speak his language
You don't use his toothpaste
You don't do anything like that
Right?
That never exists
It's an impossibility
It's like living in a bubble
Nobody lives in a bubble
You're stained with everything around you
Everything around you
And so it's creeping in
In Section A with the word extermination
Right?
What is affanizo in Greek?
It means to destroy
To obliterate
To wipe
To take away entirely
Right?
Show me the verb, Chewie
It's next
When you think
Wait a minute
Isn't that the same thing as extermination?
No, it's not
Watch
To do away with
To remove
Right?
Something that is concealed
Something that is concealed
Right?
To secret away
Or steal something
To obscure
Do you hear where affanizo is going?
Right?
It has to do
With whether or not you can see it
It's ah, the alpha-privilege
Plus faan
The base that means to appear
So it's not appearing
Fantastic
Give me the next one
How does this stuff get translated?
On the Hebrew side
Go to this one
How does this stuff get translated?
Go down here
On the Hebrew side
Let's just jump to it
Haram
To ban
To devote
To exterminate
What is the concept here?
Do you want to know
What is uniquely
Hebrew?
If you do, it's really, you know, it's fascinating
Because they left us the Septuagint
And then attempted to translate it
It's very interesting that you can pick out
You can filter out the cultural influences from the Hebrew
This word, haram, is very specific
In context all the time
And it means to take a group of people
And wipe them out
To take a group of people
And dedicate them to your God of death
Wait a minute
What?
Check this out
Check this out
I know, we don't get the concept in Greek
We're trying to creep
Afanesimus toured it
But we can't quite get there
Right?
Because that evil language of Hellenism
That evil language of Hellenism was sitting
Saying, hey, look at democracy, brah
Lots of different people
There are no races
There's only two types of people
And we'll say the Greeks
Which Greeks?
The Athenians
Do you know what they said?
When the language was at its peak
Do you know what they said?
It's not about races
It's about your language
There are those of us who know Mother Greek
And those of us who don't
And those who don't speak like
No music in them whatsoever
You want to be one of those people
You want to be one of those Anglo-Saxons
You want to be one of those Oscans
You want to be a Roman with your Latin
All right, let's go
Next one down
I think it's time for me to call in
Calling the sergeant
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Because what do we do?
Oh, I just wanted you to see
We've got extremities of age here
And we're always talking about that
Nakey kid with Jesus
He was a Neoniskos
Well, we've got the young and the old
We've got the extremes
Who are the people that we kill?
Who are the people that we perform
Complete and total genocide upon
In antiquity
Who are these people that we do this to?
Those who are outside of the monest box
Right, and who do we kill?
The young, from the youngest to the oldest
Men and women
And what else?
Even their cattle
Their calves
Those animals they use that come under the yoke
You know what I'm talking about
Those works, those work animals
Kill them all
What are you going to kill them with?
You're going to kill them with the edge of the sword
What about the gold?
The gold?
You dedicate to the service of God
This concept is not Hellenistic
It is not
Why?
Because Mother Greek embraces everyone
Yeah, they were giving themselves over
People were giving themselves over
Fantastic, amazing
Let me call in, I think that's it
We got one more, one more Chewie
And then we're going to bring in the drill sergeant people
And he will answer all of your questions
And guide you
Take you exactly where you need to be
Please listen to him
At that time we took all the towns
Completely, I think this is Jesus speaking
No, not the one you're thinking of
But the one you call, what do you call Jesus?
Oh, Joshua
Yeah, that's right
The men, women, children
Nothing, give me the next one
Nothing left
We kill them all
That's the way, go
This is the concept
This is the non-Hellenistic concept
When you're taking the filter
And you're shaking out the rocks
All the dust is falling down there on the bottom
And all you've got left are these bigger rocks on the top
This is what you shake out
Okay, now check out the bottom of this
This is the concept in Hebrew
Of genocide
Look at the bottom comment
Pull up the bottom, pull up the bottom comment
Again, this is ancient
The stuff that we think was at a certain time
But we don't have any of it surviving
So let's see what, here we go
People read this, what is this thing?
Thing hostile to theocracy
And therefore to be either destroyed
Or in the case of certain objects
I.e. or A.G., silver and gold
Vessels of brass and iron
No reason to destroy that
So set apart to sacred uses
That's what we need to do
This is part of a word
This is part of a word
It's an expression of human action
It's an expression of human action
The language carries this action
And it carries it via the speaker's beliefs
Did you see tonight?
All the beliefs, we believe it was here
We believe it was here
It's proposed that it's here
It's proposed that it's there
We don't have any that survives
What do we have that survives?
We have a shit ton of Greek
Let's see
Let's go ahead and leave that up for a minute
But give me, you know what?
I'm gonna go grab the sergeant
And what I want you to do is sing
Happy Birthday to Jova one more time
Yahoo, yahoo, when's your birthday?
Everybody
Happy Birthday to Yahoo
Happy Birthday to Yahoo
Happy Birthday, Elohim Hashim Jova
It was in the third century
Fantastic
I'm glad you got that introduction
Now, shut up and listen to me
I've been watching your comments
I know what you're doing
And I admire the fact that there are those of you
Who are taking initiative
Doing what you need to do to get done
I'm gonna show you tonight
As we finish unit one
I'm going to show you tonight
Where you should be
What you should be doing
All you have to do is listen to me
I know people are writing and saying
You know what?
I got a terrible grade
When I was in high school Latin
That's because your Latin teacher sucked
Yeah, that's why
Your Latin teacher was not
A true representative of the guild
Fantastic
If they drove you away
They probably drove everyone away
Yeah, yeah
I'm here to give you the dope
To keep you moving
You have got to run these obstacle courses
What are we doing in unit one?
We are getting you to start thinking
In Greek letters
To start thinking in Greek letters
That's all we're doing
We're showing you what is a verb, a noun
And an adjective
Basic words
Basic words
Don't worry, those are all things
We're gonna give them to you
The ones that you need to know
Will give them to you
Don't worry
What am I gonna do tonight?
I'm gonna take you on that obstacle course
I want you to run it with me
Okay, there are those of you who know
You can make it through the year
And there are those of you who are afraid
I will make you succeed
I will make you succeed
So shut up and listen to me
Chewie, give me the first slide tonight
Boom
We're gonna do some words together, people
I'm gonna spell this for you
This first one
Let's just spell this together
Alpha, gamma, omicron, row, alpha
Oh, isn't that nice?
Now, what have I got here?
I'm gonna tell you this once
You will never make a mistake again
This is a noun
Do you know how I knew that so quickly?
Because look at the tail end of the entry
It's got an eta there
With a rough breathing over it
Hey, that's a definite article
Nouns, get, definite articles
What is a definite article?
It's our word, the, the
It's a little bit more sophisticated
Than our the and on
Right?
It's a little more sophisticated
You'll get to enjoy the definite article
But that's how I know it's a noun
This is a noun
What is an agorah?
Agorah
That first word that you see
That's the nominative case
Remember, I told you to memorize
Nominative, genitive, dative, accusative
Those four cases, always in that order
Nominative, genitive, dative, accusative
What is this?
The first one is the nominative
The second one is the genitive
Agoras
Agoras
Good
Notice over the alpha, please
Is a smooth breathing
It looks like an apostrophe
You're not going to call that an apostrophe
You're going to call it a smooth breathing
In our new language that will open your brain
It's a smooth breathing
What is a smooth breathing?
Has no H sound
Rough breathing
The other way, open parentheses
That has an H sound accompanying with this
This is smooth breathing
No H sound
Good, agorah, agoras, hey
What is that?
It's a marketplace
It's a place for you to go and exchange
And to interact
Oh, God, and people say it's like a grocery store
No, it's not
You can go see doctors
You can do all sorts of stuff
You can meet there
I'll meet you in the marketplace
Oh, let's get some fruit
Give me the next one
Watch this, people
I want you to spell these words out
This is your vocabulary
Look at it and say
Alpha, delta, epsilon, lambda, phi, omicron, sigma
I'm going to do it again
Alpha, delta, epsilon, lambda, phi, omicron, sigma
Look at that sigma on the end
That's the terminal, sigma
It's the one that looks like the snake
Otherwise, it's an omicron
With a little tail on the top part of it
Looking to the east
Fantastic
What's its genitive form?
Adelfu
Now, what's going on?
Look at that
Those last two vowels are omicron, epsilon
And those two vowels are what you call a diphthong
People have said, I saw you
I saw you writing about it
What's a diphthong?
What's a diphthong?
It's just two vowels stuck together
And it comes together to make a different sound
Omicron, ah, epsilon, ooh
What happens when you bring ah-ooh together?
You get ooh
Here, a little bit of that diagrama
A little bit of that diagrama
Stuck in that epsilon, wah
That's the wah sound, ooh
Nice, nice
And its definite article is ho
Now, that looks different from hey
Yes, because hey is feminine
Ho is masculine
Toh is neuter
Ho, hey, toh
All words for the
That's called the definite article
And you will know a noun's gender
Because of its definite article
Oh, god
Now, are there exceptions to that?
Of course, there are sometimes
Sometimes things are not so obvious
99.9999% of the time
I want you to hold this notion
The definite article shows you the gender
Of the noun
You want to see the gender of the noun?
Come here now
Come here now
Let me see that gender
Let me see it
Ooh, this one is neuter
How do you tell that?
You tell it from the definite article
That's what that tail is giving you there
Pay attention to it
Give me the next one
Boom
Boom
Anthropos
Anthropo
Ho
You know
This thing has got a masculine definite article on it
What is an anthropos?
It's a person
Don't say man
I know your book translates it that way
It's not
It's a general person
The anthropology is the
Studying the people
Yes, gorgeous
One thing I want you to notice
What this word is doing
Now there's something going on here
That you can't hear
There's something going on
And I love your frightened little minds
I love them
I love them
Oh, God
It's like
Okay, let's not go there
Anthropos
Look where the accent is
It's over alpha
Don't be afraid, people
For those of you who are not afraid
Something's wrong with you
You should be
But for those of you who are afraid
Everybody
Everybody
Don't worry
The drill sergeant is yelling at everyone
Just follow my instructions
Look at the accent on this thing
It's over the alpha
But what happens on the genitive?
The accent jumps to the omega
It goes from anthropos
To anthropo
And why do we do that?
Because the ending of the word has a diphthong
Diphthongs are long
They're long
And what happens?
What do you mean long?
Extra time
For you, it's extra time
And when you put that much time into something
It's going to drag that accent toward it
It's like gravity
This is all musical
It's all musical, right?
Greek
Now, there's a lot of classical scholars out there
And you can walk up to one
You know, get their attention
Slap them
You know, shake them
Hey, classical philologists
Tell me something
Right, tell me something
Was ancient Greek musical?
And they'll have to say yes
Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to
Plumb the depths
Of that musicality
This is something you'll develop
You'll develop a little bit of appreciation
But to the level that the Greeks had it going
It's the reason they could say
There's two types of people
And there were those who speak Greek
And those who don't
Right?
The division of the Jew
And the Gentile in the Septuagint
Is a reflection of this very idea
You say, I thought the ungodly, Hellenistic Greek
I thought it was, you know, something came later
No, no, no
Do you see why you have to fabricate history
By assuming the language
There was a language back then
It was called ancient Hebrew
Do you see why you have to fabricate that history
If you're a theologian or a monist
Because the authority is in the language
And if you don't have a language
You don't have authority
Yeah, you know
It's an attempt
It's an attempt to adapt
Good
Let's go to the next one
Give me another word, Chewie
Give me another word
Boom
Watch this, Biblion Bibliu
Look, read these
Read these, look at that accent, Biblion
I just want you to attempt the accent now
Beta Eota Beta Lambda Eota Omicron New
Spells Biblion
And what is Biblion?
You're going to say book
No, it's a scroll
That's okay
That's okay
If you want to translate this book
I'll give you that one
Notice that this one is neuter
Neuter
Look at the top on the end of it
That means it's neuter
Neuter, okay, look
None of this are you learning
Because you're a smarty
This is just physics
This is elements that we're dealing with
That's it
It's just physics
There's no reasoning that you're going to be needing
Put away your calculators
People are shocked when I say that
But when they come into Greek, I tell them
You're going to have a problem
Because your brain thinks it's intelligent
Right?
You know, so does mine
I suffer from the same humanity
The Greek will teach you that you are not
Was that somebody at the...
At the port?
Hang on
Give me a second
Give me a second
I told you to clamp down those doors, right?
They're going to...
Stormtroopers are going to keep doing that
Chewie, we got to watch that
Give me the next one
Now, what do you know right away about it?
You saw the ta
You know, this is a neuter
Fantastic, it's a neuter noun
What does this one mean?
Doron
A doron is a gift
A doron is a gift
Give me the next one
We're going to fly through these
And then I want to give you a couple of reviews
People, here's another type of word
Let's just appreciate this little type of word
It's called a preposition
Preposition
It's preposition
Yeah, it's going to come before a noun
And it's going to tell you
I can either go into this noun
I can come out of this noun
Or I can be in this noun
Ace into
X or X out of
And in
Prepositions are just
Positional words
Under
Over
Within
Right
Yes, prepositions
Prepositions, they're going to come before
The noun
Excellent
That they govern
Go ahead
Give me the next one
Gorgeous
Look at this gorgeous
Ergon ergo
What is that?
It's a work
What do you talk about
When you mention ergonomics
Ergon means a work
A work
All right, now some of these concepts
That I'm giving you
As soon as they're like seeds
And we put them in your brain
And they blow up
As soon as you start seeing
This thing used
Oh, God, you're going to start getting excited
And things are going to happen
You're going to have certain feelings
Certain chemistry is going to be going on
And it makes me want to say
Stop
And watch
What's happening to yourself
The Greeks
During the first century
To the about second
Anodomony
First BC
They're very fond of this concept
Think about this
Think about this intellectually
The contrast
Between logos
And ergon
What is logos?
Logos is records
Logos is reckoning
What is ergon doing?
What is the difference
Between reckoning and doing?
Is there some sort of magic
Physics going on
Between reckoning or reasoning
And making, acting
Is there a difference
Between action and being?
Linguistically, the grammarians
Are quick to point out
That this is just the difference
Between a verb and a noun
Yeah, yeah, yeah
What does the verb do?
It can do two things, right?
It can be
Or it can do
Ergon, logos
Ergon, logos
What is wrapped up in the verb?
Ergon and logos
What is your noun?
Your noun is just those things
That are affected
By the ergon or the logos
Okay, trust me
By the time you're done
When somebody says
In the beginning was the word
Your mind will go back
To the native of the time
That they wrote it
This is the power of the words
That they have for you
You're sitting there
Do you want this capacity?
Do you want this capacity
To do this and do exactly
Exactly what I say
Hit me with the next one
Look at that, wait a minute
There's two definite articles here
You're gonna say, hey
Why would that be?
Because you can have a theos
That's a ha or a hey
And the thing they're not telling you
Because this is an introductory
Intensive course
It's introductory
You'll find out when you get in the bush
This is just to train you
So you can go out into the bush
And when you're out there in the bush
You're gonna find that
Not everything holds together
We're gonna study 2,000 years
In Greek
And things change
And you gotta know
In early Greek
In Archaic
Homeric Greek
And I'm not talking about
A proposed language
Because we have it
It survives
Because it dominated
The mind
The Bacchic Empire
The mind was everything
And there was no language
Not even Latin
Could stand it
The Romans walking around saying
We conquered them
And they came back with that language
And they conquered us
The power of Greek
Do you know what you do to your enemies
When all you've got is arguments?
You demonize them
There is a movement of people
Who will meet the exception
Of the science and they will demonize it
Happens all the time
It's the natural kinetics of the universe
You know what I'm saying
You're sitting there
And you know what I'm saying
Did my tiny little brain
Did my tiny peat...
Oh God, it's so average
My brain is so average
Was it able to get to these places
Without mother Greek?
Uh-uh
Right?
Special operations soldiers
Right?
They have it inside them
Those guys, their instructors
They just bring it out
They just bring it out
Know yourself
You know who knows who they are?
Somebody who's brought it out
And the dope that I'm giving you
Will cause you to bring it out
Love it
Do you need to be smart?
If you did, I wouldn't be here
Okay?
I'm just telling you that
All honesty
Yeah, fantastic
It's humbling
Working with the muses is humbling
Because people want to give you credit
And they want to tell you
Oh my God, this is James
This thing, what are you saying?
All I'm giving you are her songs
That's all
I'm just giving her songs
Love it
Go to the next one
What is that, Chewie?
Oh, that is gorgeous
Gorgeous, gorgeous
Look at the fire play
This is gorgeous
Let's go to the next one
Nice art, Chewie
Beautiful job
Tell that AI
The service is slave away
Theos, theou
Or hey, can be
Can be masculine or feminine
You mean, wait a minute
Wait a minute
This language, this evil language
Of the Greek
Is able to envision
Female divinity
Now I know all the monists just laughed
I know they just laughed
The idea of a female divinity
Right, because monism is atheism
Is atheism
DK is a woman
And if you haven't learned that DK is a woman
That justice is a woman
Maybe Julian was right
Maybe the emperor Julian was right
The monist will destroy your very language
Set up a fairy tale
A fairy tale
Why did you see the merch?
It's all about merch
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Do you know who said that?
The Furies
The Greek Furies
Speaking Hellenistic Greek
They said, hey, you
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
What do we want, people?
We're not here because we want the fairy tale
We're here because we want the reasoned logos
We're here because we want reality
Now, give me the next one
Faith, do you know what faith is good for?
Deception
Faith is good for deception
Faith says don't believe what you're seeing
With your senses
What you're perceiving
Don't trust your frame
Do you know everything that Ancient Greek is based upon?
Everything
The whole thing is a foundation
It's got one foundation
And that foundation is use your mind
Use it
The serpent was the wisest of all creatures
Okay
Here's three more nouns, right?
What am I doing, people?
I'm getting you used to the lettering
Make love to this
Techne, technes, right?
Techne, it's skill, it's skill
These are all feminine, by the way
Hora, that's the countryside
Let's go out to the Hora
And we can energize her
What is it called, that thing inside of you?
I don't know, is it here, is it here?
It's kind of here, right?
Don't think, I don't know, maybe too much up there
Psyche, soul
Where is your soul?
It's in your thumos
It's in your thumos, how do you know?
When you're dead, you breathe out your soul
And if you are over the person dying
You can breathe it in
You can breathe it in
Isn't that a gorgeous thought?
Isn't that a gorgeous thought?
Psyche
Do you know who fell in love with your soul?
Psyche
I'll give you a hint
He's a handsome devil
And he's got wings
And a bow
And he's got arrows
And he shoots those into Psyche
What I am telling you is a mystery
It's the mystery of the Donbringer
It's the mystery of Eros
Eros
Now, if you're an atheist
And you don't worship Eros
I am sorry for your spouse
I am sorry
Ladies of frustration, please
Hang in there
Salvation is coming
Let's go to the next one
What else do we have? Give it to them
They've got to love this stuff
Give it to them, I'm going to give it
It's going to be right down the chute
Give it to me, next one
A couple of verbs
Remember this chapter we're focusing really on nouns
We're going to have verbs next to units
Because verbs are the big machines
They're the big machines of the language
So for right now, we're hitting you with the verbs
I'm going with the nouns
We're going to hit you with adjectives as well
Don't worry, we'll get there
Here are two verbs
Paidewe
Look at how I'm pronouncing it
Paidewe
You hear my digama coming out of the Upsilon?
Paidewe
It means to teach
Please
Somebody, look at the root Paide
P, Alpha, E, Yoda, Delta
By the way, somebody asked the question
I saw this in the correspondence somewhere
What's another primer that I should get?
If you get another primer, get out!
Do not get any other tool
Stay on this course
I can promise you
All they do, and I say that seriously
All that does is cause confusion
I have to undo, for example
What books like...
I've got one right here
Reading Koine Greek
That thing is so bad
It is so bad if somebody's been in that text
I have to undo the damage
That was done to them
Granted, they're always thankful
And it's usually seminarians
They're always thankful
But it's a damaging process, people
I want you to stick with our text
Please, stick with our intensive Greek
By Hanson and Quinn
Here, give me that chewy
Stick with our intensive Greek
Intensive course
You got it, people
And people, please
Do not, do not buy the chemical muse
Somebody sent me an email
It's $2,000
I have not made anything from that
And I will not make anything from that
I won't
All you're doing
Is you are wasting your resources
I don't want to take away food from your family
Right?
Get clever
Find it
There are ways
That's fantastic if you do
Find it
You'll know how to find it
My God, man, hoist a flag
With skull and bones on that thing
And find it
You mean you're undercutting yourself
I can't tell you how many people don't understand
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Have you ever seen me advertise anything?
Do you see a poster of my book?
Do you see it?
You don't
And you never will
And why is that?
Because the devil told me
You'd be one of those back alleys
You'd be one of those back alley blanks
I can't say it on YouTube
And you know what I'm going to do to you
And then he went through a list of things
A litany
A litany
Most of them had to do with parts of me
That I don't want to expose
Money
Greed
Your greed
Says that wing of gorgeous devil
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Do you know where?
Now remember, this is a great concept
And I want you to be absorbing these great concepts
Aros is a purifier
Do you know what you cannot do?
You cannot offer a lover
Cash
And buy their love
You can't do it
The one who is in love
Will cross oceans
Will suffer disease
Will do everything in the world
For that love
That's Aros
You can't buy Aros
You can't buy Aros
Do you know what is not classical?
You know what is not classical?
Greed
It's constantly
And Jesus came along and he said
It was the root of all evil
He said the love
That desire for profit
In Greek the word is the desire for profit
It's translated as the love of money
It's not
It's the drive for profit
For making profit
Making over what you need to survive
Is called greed
And what happens?
The muse doesn't like greed
Hates greed
Evaporates in the presence of greed
It's a part of the pact with the devil people
We need this esoteric knowledge
And in order to acquire it
You gotta purge your greed
Purge your greed
That is one of the evil ideas
Of Hellenism
That is one of the ideas
It's not the idea of annihilation
And extermination
It is the idea that greed
Is a destroyer of democracy
Isn't that gorgeous?
You wanna rule yourselves?
Get rid of your greed
Love it
Love it so much
Yeah throw your money like that
Throw your money in there
Right, see what I mean? Jesus
Oh, soul sucker
Now come on
Come on
In all fairness
Soul sucking has gotten a black eye
Yeah definitely
It's definitely gotten a black eye
Karl Marx spoke ancient
No, stop it purple
Stop it, I'm glad you brought up this point
Karl Marx did not speak ancient Greek
Karl Marx was a classicist
He studied and translated ancient Greek
Yeah, that's what we have to do
We're not here to speak ancient Greek
Because when you say he spoke ancient Greek
What you're doing is you're making ancient Greek
A modern Greek
You're making it a language that is a spoken language
You're making it an active process
And that is not how you learn
A language that is no longer an active language
You have to draw that distinction
You don't go in learning to speak it
You go in learning to translate it
Your mind crawls into bed with these gorgeous concepts
Now purple, I know where you were going
Karl Marx, what's that way?
What is that? Does anybody know what that means?
I don't know what that means
Yeah, I'm French
Very good, that's okay
Look at this, by the way
Good, good
The French, oh god
Oh god, thank you for joining us
Your unique courage
Your old Celtic courage
Yeah, love it, and by the way
Total devotees of Eros
Total kudos, kudos
To all the French kudos
You know what, I was just south of Dijon
And French purple will be able to tell you
Oh god, he's in that gorgeous country of the vine
Who do you think Bacchus passed on
All of his knowledge to
It's buried in the French countryside in those vines
Those California vines have nothing
On those French vines
I stood with a Frenchman, his wine
He was dressed and he's got his big boots on
He's dressed with overalls, he's working
He's doing his vineyarding
And he says, hey try this, try this lovely
And it was like metallic mushroom dirt
It felt like I was being energized by some kind of
Maternal, maternal sauce of the cosmos
Oh god, no, don't underestimate
The classical wisdom that lies buried in French culture
It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous
It makes me envious
And thank you purple, good comment
Go to the next one, I want to keep us on task here tonight
Watch people, here's a couple of sentences
Now, we've learned nouns
And I threw up a couple of verbs there
Now we're just going to put it together
And I want to show you how to do this
The first word, ho, there's your definite article
The homeros, that's our word, homer
Ho homeros, homer, homer what?
Jump all the way to the end
There's the verb, paidewe
Homer teaches ton antropon, the man
Homer teaches the person
Look at me, I did it
Oh, you're not supposed to do that
Ah, you love it, you love it
Homer teaches the person
Watch, now how do I know this isn't the person
Who teaches Homer?
Because Homer is in the nominative case
With that ending, os, it's the nominative case
He's got to be the subject
Ton antropon is in the accusative case
How did I know that?
If I knew my definite articles
It would be obvious
We've got to know our definite articles then, right?
That's just the next thing we've got to do
So Homer teaches the man
Homero, homero, antropon paidewe
What about the one underneath that?
Now watch what happens to Homer
Ho homeru
Ho homeru
Look, it switches ending from a nominative to a genitive
And what is the ho going with it?
The ho is a nominative case as well
So it can't be accompanying the homeru
Because that's genitive, it would have to be two
So what is the ho accompanying?
It's accompanying Adelfos
The brother homeru of Homer
Do you remember how I want you to translate genitives?
Of somebody, it's possession
Of somebody
So the subject is Adelfos
Brother homeru is in the genitive case
Of Homer
The brother of Homer
What does the brother of Homer do?
Paidewe
He educates
Who's he educating?
Ton antropon
Nice accusative case there
You see the accusative ton antropon
With that on ending on the end of it
Good, it's an accusative case
It's the object of the verb
Alright, look, that's all you need to be knowing
Now what am I doing to you that you don't realize it?
I'm cramming
I'm super or hyper exposing you to the Greek
You're being forced to follow it
Well, there's 80% of you out there
Who are started from ground zero
Are now saying, oh, I'm just beginning
I can kind of follow the word
I can kind of follow the letters here all put together
Right?
We're running, and you're running with me
That's all we're doing
Give me the next one
Another two sentences here
Look at this
Ton homeron paidewe ho antropos
Now, wait a minute
Where is the nominative?
Where's the nominative case?
It's ho antropos
You mean the subject is at the end of the sentence?
Yes, don't let your English mind
Try to work itself out
Because we don't put subjects at the end
We do subject verb, direct object
That's how we do English
Right?
Greek
Greek doesn't care about word order
Word order is four barbarians
Word order is four barbarians
You know what the Greeks can do?
They can take 45 words and throw them up in the air
You tell me what that means
Well, there's no order to it
Yeah, there doesn't need to be an order
The endings of the words will tell you
What they're doing in the sentence
So the subject here is at the end of the sentence
Ho antropos
The person
The person does what paidewe
Teaches
Ton homeron
It's an accusative
So it's the thing
It's the thing person or place
That's being taught
That's being acted upon by the verb
The person teaches Homer
What does the bottom line say?
Homeros tus antropos paidewe
Where's your subject?
Homeros
It's got that os, nominative ending
Where's your direct object?
Tus antropos
That's what we're going to be acting on
Is the men
Notice they're in the plural now
Plural
We've got singular and plural nouns
Dog or dogs
Singular and plural
And so how would you translate this?
Sentence Homer teaches the people
Homer teaches the people
Okay, now you can go back over these examples
And if you do
Just these last 10 minutes
Of what we've been working on
If you do
What I want you to do
Is I want your eyes to track the text
I want your eyes to be able to read it
Ton homedon
Even if you don't understand it
Because really what's going on with you
You're just learning the alphabet
You're just at that stage
Where you're learning alphabet again
With delta
That's it
And that's what we're trying to do
We're trying to reset your mind
With the Greek letters
Look at how beautiful these things are
If I didn't tell you before
These are superior to English
The English alphabet
The Latin alphabet
That's because I was derelict in my duty
Look at the musicality of this language
Look at that P
What does that P make you want to do
On the front of Pidewe
It makes me, I don't know
It does something inside of me
With the curves
Look at the curves on that
Look at how the top
Just kind of coalesces
It kind of just becomes part of the two
It's like a bridge Pidewe
It's gorgeous
I kind of like the Omega too
The Omega
Look at the Omega on Anthropos
Excuse me, on Anthropos
On the end of the first line
Look at that Omega
Do you see how curvaceous that Omega is?
That's musical, baby
That's musical right there
Oh, God
Yeah, love it
Okay, let's stop
Let's stop with that
Give me another one
Look, now we're going to get a little more complicated
With this first sentence
I just want to illustrate one thing
Look at that third word
Bibliois
Finally, we get a dative case
We've had nominative as a subject
Genitive as possession or of
I want you to translate it of something
Of Homer
Then we've had the accusative
That's the fourth one
And it's always a direct object
The one we're leaving on is dative
The dative
And what do you do with the dative?
It's the indirect object
Well, what does that mean, Maynard?
Let me tell you what it means
You're going to translate it as to, for, or with
You're going to try it every time
You know what this sentence says
With to, for, or with?
Homer teaches his brother the art
With books
You hear that? With books
What is a dative?
It's a dative of instrument or means
It's a dative of something that gives you
The capacity to do something
Do you need to remember that when you're translating?
Yeah, you do
But what do you really need to know?
What's the cheat?
Just translate those datives as to, for, or with
When you're starting out like this
To, for, or with
The dative is something beautiful
Dative is something beautiful
And it's got this yoda in it
Homer teaches his brother the skill
By means of books
With books
Good, that's a double-accusative on the end
Ton of adelfon and tentechnique
Double-accusative
Now we sound like nerds, right?
Now we sound like nerds
What do you need to take home?
Nominative, subject, genitive, possession
Dative, to, for, or with
Accusative
Object of the verb
That's what the verb's acting on
Gorgeous
Give me the next one
I'm just gonna fly
Because I'm taking away too much
Of these professionals' time
And I respect you guys too much
This chart you must memorize
Is from Unit 1
You must memorize these endings
Notice on the left, nominative, genitive
Dative and accusative, right?
I want you to memorize
People are always telling me
I can't get all these things right in my head
I can't get all these forms right in my head
Then stop
If it's not working, then stop
Something's wrong
Abandon that approach, right?
Don't try to get these things straight
Build the muscle
A-A-E-A-N
I own ice, us
What are those plurals?
I own ice, us
What are those plurals?
In the feminine, first declension
In Greek, I own ice, us
I have that cell programmed in my head
And reinforced from the last 35 years
That I will wake up still
Chanting paradigms
I own ice, us
Do you know why people make fun
Of those Brits for their schooling?
Their young boys and girls in their classes
Chanting off the Greek endings
You know what they were doing?
They recognized they were building
Machines of classical civilization
That's what you're doing
You're doing it with a language
You're doing it with a language, isn't that fantastic?
I am going to capacitate you
Do you know what my job is?
It's to capacitate you
I'm going to take your brain
And I'm going to capacitate it
In and out
Get that chart memorized, people
Next one
Trust me, trust me
These things will help
Sit on the toilet if you have to
I own ice, us
Let's go to the second declension
Here's the chart
You've got to memorize for the second declension
Ignore that vocative at the bottom
Ignore that
I just want you to see the
Nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative
Logos, logu, right?
What are the endings?
Osu, oy, on
What are they in the plural?
Oy, on, oy, sus
Oy, on, oy, sus
What are they in the feminine?
I, on, ice, us
What are they in the masculine?
Oy, on, oy, sus
Oy, on, oy, sus
Make it native
Make it native
How do you do that?
You listen to Cicero
Cicero, c'mere Cicero
Pull up your toga
What did Cicero tell us
That nobody ever listens to?
Repetitio est mater schientiae
What did you say there in your Latin?
Cicero
Repetition is the mother of learning
Repetition, repetition, repetition
These are reps
What do you think?
Do you go to the gym?
What do you think?
Do you stand there and you're like, oh, I'm not, I can't do this.
I can't look, it's heavy.
I can't lift it up.
Well, guess what?
You're going to start reps.
And eventually that thing's not going to be heavy.
You are going to be using your muscle.
It's the same thing with the Greek.
These are the reps that you have to do.
Right now, if I've got 30 students in front of me in seminary
and I'm forcing them to do reps,
yes, there is something sadistic about it.
There is, but there's a point where the student reaches
an internalizing of these endings that it's so satisfactory.
So satisfactory.
Let's finish up.
Last one.
What do we have here?
Finally, your definite article.
People.
Look at the masculine definite articles.
Don't those look like the endings that we're just seeing?
What do we do?
Look at the plurals.
Hoy, tone, toys, twos.
They look a lot like the declensional endings.
So it's not too far of a jump.
Look at the feminine.
Hey, taste, hey, tain.
High tone, tice, toss.
High tone, tice, toss.
High tone, tice, toss.
Right.
What about the neuter?
Notice that the neuter, nominative and accusative are the same.
You mean I don't know in a sentence whether the neuter is the subject
or the object?
No.
You have to figure it out.
You have to figure it out.
Now, how are you?
Don't, not with your brain.
Don't worry.
But just by the way, all of those words that have been thrown up into the air,
just by the way it glides around, you'll see it.
Because what you have to learn with Greek,
that you don't have to learn with English,
is universal interaction.
I'm going to tell you that now.
And it's something that I teach to all of my students through the Greek
without them even knowing it.
You're going to have to throw up a bunch of concepts into the air.
And you're going to have to be able to see their connections.
Greek, mother Greek, is all about teaching you connections.
Let's go ahead and take it down, Chewie.
For those of you who are frustrated,
for those of you who are in a position of being overwhelmed,
guess what?
We all are.
We all are.
And if you're not, you're not an ancient Greek.
What we're doing is we're coming from a step down to a much more demanding art.
The Greek language, everybody thinks languages are created equal.
Ancient Greek is not English.
It's not Chinese either.
Chinese has about 100, 125,000 unique words.
Again, that's time to the Greek.
Now you're going to have to stand up and expand.
You're going to have to meet the mark.
And how are you going to do that?
You're going to memorize those last three charts that I gave you.
You're going to do exercises.
What I want you to do for next week is I want you to work on any of those
sentences that you have in the exercises of Unit 1.
And then I want you to push ahead.
And I want you to read Unit 2.
We're going to start reading about verbs.
Next week, at AminU, I will bring up half a dozen sentences.
And I will read through them with you.
And you can check yourself.
If you try them this week, you can check yourself.
Only the ones that are in the exercises.
The exercises.
Don't look at the drills for now.
Look at the exercises.
We're going to be exercising.
That's our circuit that we run.
Now, I want to tell you before we end today, I want to tell you,
I have to set you up to receive this kind of advanced knowledge.
When you're on that course, if you can't do sit-ups and push-ups,
you're never going to get to that point where you can climb,
scale that giant obstacle fearlessly.
That's where we have to get you.
And that's what I'm working on for you.
So please, people, please, until the next time we meet,
those of you who are actively pursuing the Greek,
please try some exercises and read Unit 2.
We are not going to accept any money.
We are still not monetized.
Please do not listen to strangers who try to lure you
into intellectual back alleys where they can take advantage of you.
You are the intellectual Marines of the Renaissance.
Thank you for coming tonight.
Hail Satan.
Don't bring a group cutter.
You sing a Athena lover.
Don't bring a group cutter.
You sing a Athena lover.
Don't bring a group cutter.
You sing a Athena lover.
The devil rides out.
The Irish witch.
I'm with the dragon lady.
Don't I bring roots I cut.
I am being with Dia's love.
