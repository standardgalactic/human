Back Alley Extraction
Hit you with a ticket, hands nodding
Open chemists to the moon, the language of the birds
Death above a pure, wild stallion crew
Rolling in a main, magic gin, 60 pound of green
Diamond shining, I'm in this thing
Cornstone ring, bling and bling
Hot purple lean, venomous cream
Silver seven seas, hot fire
Gasoline, dance with the muse
Athena, metadata, flying in your dreamer
Doom gate keeper, blaze the ganja greener
Greek fire keeper, ome sima sima
Maduro riding with me, my girls with it
Dragon poison, every rose has its thorn
White snake, obvious
Hot fire Gasoline, Medea, Medesina
Hot fire Gasoline, and Satan come to see ya
Hot fire Gasoline, Medea, Medesina
Hot fire Gasoline, and Satan come to see ya
It's a little field trip, and it's going to be a lot of fun
And I think it's an honor
I think it's an honor here at OmenU
To be able to talk to the people that we're going to talk to tonight
Tonight we're going to have a conversation with all boy here
And he's going to tell us what he's doing
And he's going to tell us about the Greek that he has worked through
Fantastic, I love it, I love it, I really do
First I want to talk to you about something new
We are going to have Experiment Alpha
Take place this Friday evening
This Friday evening's Lady Babylon will be Experiment Alpha
And what we are going to do is we are going to examine a patient
We'll call him Patient One
And he has been inoculated
He's been inoculated and what we're doing is we're subjecting him to the Holy Spirit
We're subjecting him to the Christ
And we're going to see if the inoculation was strong enough
So that we can cure humanity
Isn't that great? Isn't that great? You love it
Now, I will tell you
This person who is coming on is not somebody that I have had on before
And I think you will all be extremely pleased at his presence
So that's coming Friday
Tonight what we're going to do is first we're going to look at a person who has gone through intensive Greek
And is now putting together all sorts of great, great, great, great stuff
Tracking down, this gent is tracking down the purple in his homeland
Across the pond, fantastic, let's bring him on
Bring on old boy, old boy, thank you so much for coming
Would you please formally introduce, I know a lot of the Lady Babylon folks already know you
But give yourself an introduction that you want to give the world
And you won't be interrupted by any commercials or anything like that
Go for it
Well, thanks for having me here first off
It's great to be able to speak to everybody
And basically I've been through the intensive course under Amon
And it's been such a great experience
I think we've been studying around about just under a year and a half
And going from not even being able to read the letters to now being able to go
And research texts and start translating sections of them and presenting them
It's been a liberating experience
Thank you for the time that you put in to taking me through that process
It's been a great job that you've done, right?
You marched through the basic training
And now you're working with the text and I saw one of your videos the other day
One of your videos the other day and it was gorgeous
You broke down, you quoted the Greek, I was like this giant nerd, I love it
And so that drew you to the purple
Tell us a little bit about your purple quest
So as you know, they found a chunk of the purple at the excavation of a bath house
It was very close to where I lived and grew up
So I thought, you know what, I'll get in touch with them
I'll see if I can go down there, get on site
Put together a little short documentary and they got back to me and said, yeah, that's going to be cool
So, you know, that was arranged
And then I thought, well, why not piece together a mini series looking at texts that mentioned the origin of it
The medical applications of it, you know, and then the cult uses as well
And then I thought, you know, I can just translate some chunks of texts and piece them together with some scenery
Nearby where I live and just present them
And as well, it's good for me because it gets me diving into those texts
It keeps me reading every day because as you know, it's something you need to be doing every day
Because it does slip out of the brain and it keeps me focused
It keeps me going and it keeps me looking at Greek texts
So it's a win-win all around
Yeah, what you hear is discipline
Right, everybody's watching on you tonight who's got your book
This is discipline that old boy is exhibiting here
This is an example to follow
Now, he's running down archaeologists, can you believe that?
Running down archaeologists and talking to them about it
They told you they found some more, didn't they?
Yeah, that's right
So that hasn't, you know, hit the major or anything yet
So it was Frank Jekko who's the person overseeing the dig
I managed to get a short five-minute interview with him
And I said I was obviously interested in it and he kind of had a little smile
And he went, we found another piece, you know, so
Yeah, I was very excited to get that news and share it with you all
So yeah, they found another piece
Look at that, look at that, a scoop!
A scoop, you got the story there and you know what?
I'm sure he'd love talking with you
I'm sure it was like, you know, something neat, you know what I mean?
Because somebody here you are and you're interested
And you've got the background to be able to work with the texts and stuff
Wow, that's impressive
Isn't it liberating old boy when you can actually work with those primary texts yourself?
Yeah, it's absolutely incredible
You know, when I was first getting interested in this kind of stuff
I would be researching, trying to compile texts
Some of it would be in Latin, some of it would be in Greek
And you're there going, I just wish I knew what it said
And now that I've been through that process
You know, I can just get a piece of text
I can be there with the text, Alexicon, using Alice
And then I can work through a translation
Yeah, good, and you've got your smith grammar
In case anything gets funny out in the bush
Tell us, oh look at that
Tell us, where do you go from here?
I know that you're interested in some things like Gaelic
Or like you were going to go up north maybe and study some
Oh, what were you into? It was that Norse, right?
Norse, tell us, what is the future?
And how do you see using your classical studies?
Well, obviously family life was a little bit hectic
It's quieting down a bit now
And I can focus on moving forward with the Greek
I still do want to pursue the runology
That is an interest of mine
I'm always tracing down the origin of where these runic scripts came from
Right now, I just want to be able to look at texts
And just, I think it's a nice little package
That I've found that I can deliver to people
Where I can translate a text, go around some scenery
Because I've got some amazing historical sites on my doorstep
And I can join the two together and just present them
So, I'm happy doing that
And that's what excites me
And as I said, it keeps me reading the Greek
And that's something I want to develop to the next level
I love that, I absolutely love that
And I know you're going to end up integrating a whole bunch of different stuff
And you're going to end up being one of those polyglots
And, you know, more power to you
You know, that's inside of some people
They don't realize it's in there
Maybe you've got a little inclination along the way somewhere
But man, that language work just brings out the beauty
Fantastic, so we should all check out Old Boy
And, you know, support him as somebody who's coming forward
And picking up those sources, right?
You could be getting in the back alley with, you know who?
You know what I mean?
You're not going to get that
You're not going to get that back alley with Old Boy
He's going to give you the stuff, baby
And look at him, you know what?
He doesn't have to defend his professor's position
And be careful about what he says
The dude is into the text and the reality
That's what I like
And Old Boy, you were an excellent, excellent student
And everybody here should look up to you
Thank you
Right?
Yeah
Give everybody a final say what's on your mind
And we'll let you go
All I would say is, you know, have faith in the book
The Hanson and Quinn's an incredible resource
You know, mine is literally still bookmarked
You know, I still refer back to it all the time
I use that in conjunction with the Smythe Greek grammar
And obviously Alice
And just trust the process
Identify your verbs first
That's all I do when I go into a text
I just identify everything and then work from there
As long as you identify everything
That's a great starting point to start from
So, you know, stick with it
It's worth it
It'll change your life and it'll change your mind
So, yeah, thanks guys
We would probably get a full class
If I were in the position to be able to bring a summer intensive course
I would have you be one of the chief instructors, drill instructors
Fabulous job
Everybody, big round of applause for Old Boy
Look at the respect, you know, feel it
Yeah, I love it, Old Boy
I'm gonna keep checking out your work
Get out of here and thank you for coming
Thanks so much, thank you, take care
All right, let's get back to the textory
Now, a lot of you here tonight
And by the way, Old Boy is genuine, baby
He is totally genuine
So, yeah, life is good sometimes
You know what I mean? Old Boy brings it out
Anywho, let's get things going
Because you feel it, you're like, yeah, I got the mojo too
Let's keep going
You have all come tonight
We have to do this specially
People here, you've come to a place before you were here
And in that place, I know, I sensed it
I smelled in that place the unholy treatment
Of the religious studies scholars of the masses
I felt it, it's like a disturbance in my chest
I can't describe it except to say that it smells a little bit like a fart
Yeah, yeah, it's amazing
Let us go and let us purge from ourselves
The probabilities and the ideas and the theories
And my ideas this and my ideas
We are not here for that, you are not here for that
I am not here to give you some kind of back alley
Fun time, that's not what my job is
Right from the devil's mouth
My job is to bring you the light
To bring you the Greek
So that you can take that Greek and forge an instrument of attack
This is so that we can take back those texts
This is our life heritage
The words of our dead ancestors
What more holy is there for us to protect than those words
Yes, let's jump into it
So we will clean off the muck because I can smell it
I can smell the...
Oh God, I know where you went
I know where you went
Now for those of you who are like
What is this guy talking about?
You weren't there, okay?
So just part of the congregation must purge
We must purge
Let's go and we will purge with reason
And with accurate linguistics
With evidence, that's how we will purge
Because you don't care about my ideas
And that's why I'm not trying to sell you anything
You don't have to be a member here
You can walk in the door and listen
This is fantastic
Welcome to the mission of Lucifer
This is wonderful
After this everybody gets to eat
And you don't realize that their food is drugged
But you're gonna do it anyway
It's all in your head
Let's go to the text tonight
Oh, thanks everyone
Yes, all boys
All right, fantastic
All comments of compliments toward all boys
Just put them in the chat there
Fantastic
I want to bring you something tonight right off the bat
And I'm just gonna translate
And after this I saw four angels standing
On the four gonias of the earth
Wait a minute
On the four what?
And what are these angels doing?
They are guarding the winds
And what, wait a minute
Am I in the book of Revelation?
This stuff is so psychedelic
Did we already get hit by the angel?
Did somebody come in and give us our...
Did we get it?
We got the right...
It's why everything is purple
Okay, good
So here we are flying right
At the four gonias
What is that?
You can translate that as corners
The four corners
Here's where I want you mentally
Think of the four corners
We're in the right
And the angelos, the messenger
Is giving us the mystery
And the mystery starts with the restraint of the winds
And if you are living in antiquity
And you are reading Greek
You know the science behind the winds
What are you?
Ignorant?
My God
Let's show you, right?
What does he say?
He's doing all this
What are the angels doing?
They're restricting that onimus
And they're keeping it from the sea
And the land
It's not going to be whistling through the trees
Give me the next one
What are we doing?
What are we doing, people?
Medea
The architect of the first mystery
In western history
Medea is the one who created a right
Whereby you could transit this life-death barrier
And in that right is this science of the winds
Medea wrote hymns to the winds
And if you don't understand that
It's because you haven't been initiated
And you don't have ears to hear
Are you ready?
You know what this is doing?
This isn't just Greek that I'm showing you
This is Greek that is using cult code
And that code was found and declared and titled
In the early 1900s by a dude
A dude, classical scholar
That's when all the great German classical scholars
Were doing their thing
Like in the 1920s and 1930s, right?
Oh God, they were so ahead of the game
And this one German dude comes along
And he says, there's a code in the Orphic
It's called the vox, right?
It's the voice
Well, these texts that I'm showing you
Are using that code
Yes, yes, you mean a throne?
Isn't the throne?
No, it's a drug
So something that is polythronic
Is a compound drug
Yes, yes, you're getting it
You're getting it
Christen someone quick
As a matter of fact, let's look
There's going to be a Christing
You want to see a Christing?
I thought you'd like to see a Christing tonight
We're going to talk about Moses
And some answers
I know some of you just came from something
I know, take a shower
Don't blame yourself
Don't blame yourself
Yes, it's very important
It's very important
Okay, let's go to the next one
Somebody's going to write
I know, watch, I'm going to get an email
Somebody's going to take that
Totally literally
All right, are you right?
Where'd they all go?
Right, okay
What is this corner of the earth?
What am I throwing at you now?
I'm throwing at you more Greek
And what does this Greek say?
It says, it's just like that rising
Those locations where you have the rising
On the corners, those corners
Those cardinal directions, right?
From which the winds are derived
They come, they blow over everything
They have their arche in the corners
Okay, so remember, we've taken the drugs
We were talking to the angel
And the angel is giving us the scientific
At the time, the scientific explanation
Of what's going on
And where is this from?
This is Ptolemy
This is Ptolemy's tetrabiblos
And in it, Ptolemy is mapping out
The science that is behind
Everything you're seeing in the apocalypse
So when monists, fundamentalists
Draw pictures and the pictures look clownish
This is why they don't understand the text
Because they haven't dissolved the seals
They haven't applied the seals
Here, what does this say?
Right, that's where it has its origin
Then he talks about the rising
The next one, here's another part, people
What does this say? It's Ptolemy
He says these winds, right?
They come from this location
And they're commonly called the southern winds
They're very warm and they're monoticoi
They're monotic? Yes, they're monotic
What does that mean exactly?
Let's give me the next one
What kind of winds are we dealing with?
Monoticos, these are relaxing winds
These are loosening winds
Now wait a minute, am I talking about anthropology
And history here? Yes
Don't lose the perspective of the right
Remember, we made the contract
It's implicit
Hey, I don't care
You wanted it, we're going there
You love it, satanic congregation
What is it, it's relaxing or loosening?
Look at the lemata of Galen
Galen uses this word to describe the lemata
Now what are the lemata?
They are things used in unguents
Remember all that stuff we're putting in our eyes
You're laying there half dead
And you've got purple ooze drizzling out of your eyes
And your cheeks covered with a chalk
That will prevent it from burning your skin
My goodness
What is the angel going to say?
What is the angel going to say?
God is about to speak, are you ready?
And she, thanks, you're an idiot
Give me the next one, give me the next one quick
Give it to him fast, watch this
And I saw another angel coming out from the east
Or the rising point of the sun
And that doesn't just say the sun, it says Helios
As in the grandfather of the Medeo
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yes, and what is he?
What's this angel on God?
Anytime you're at one of these ancient drug parties
And you're there undergoing the right
Remember the angel is going to bring you something
What's he got in his hand?
He's got spragida
What the heck are those?
Guess what people, do you think it may be drugs?
What happens is the angel gives you those things
And he starts yelling in this great voice
Right?
Who's yelling that?
Those four angels, baby
Right?
Those four angels who are standing there
Implementing the winds
The power is given to them
To do what is unjust to all the world
Okay, are you there with me?
You see those four?
Don't mess around
Follow my instructions and you'll make it all the way through
Here we go
What is that spragida the angel was carrying in his hand?
It's that medicinal stuff, you bonehead
It's the medicinal stuff
Look, it's got that priestess of Artemis
Galen is out fishing for the stuff
He's going to be by his 20,000 pills of the stuff
Right? Take it back to use in medicine
Okay, so look, this is easy
We got this done, baby
We got everything
We got all the things that we need to make this work
Hit the next one
Medically it's a pastile
That thing that the angel is carrying in his hand
Medically it's a pastile
Give me the next one
Those are all medical sources
Nobody's read these, I guarantee it
He's read Paul of Ijina
Have you ever heard of Paul of Ijina?
No, you have a physician
Another great, very popular, very influential physician
From antiquity that nobody reads
He'll tell you
And then we've got Celsus there
Look, the Roman, he's the Roman doctor
Celsus is cool
This is not the Celsus who writes against the Christians
This is the Celsus who's the first century physician
Who's attached to the Roman legion
And so he's got to have all the...
He has a whole manual of drugs
He's got the drugs for the rites
He's got, you know, what do you do if you take bull's blood?
All that kind of stuff
He's got the those, he's got the ones that are...
Oh, just straight up medical
Oh, God, how do you treat somebody with an arrow puncture?
You know what I mean?
What do you pour in there that makes it better
After you cauterize it?
Oh, God, it's gorgeous
Pastels are put in places, right?
You got parts of your body
The pastel goes into it
And what are we going to do?
We're going to do this to all the slaves of God
If you're a Christian out there today
And you are not sealed
You're doomed
You're doomed
You want to see how you get sealed in the rite?
This is real antiquity, people
This is real antiquity
You want to see how you get sealed?
Let's go
Let's seal him, he says
Let's seal him, are you ready?
We're going to do it
Epiton metopon aton
On your forehead
On your forehead
Are you ready?
Okay, you ready?
Give me the next one
Here it comes
Here comes the seal, baby
Your forehead here, yeah
Look, the space between your eyes
That's great, fantastic
Surely there's no drugs rite going on right here
Hit the next one
What is this?
Metopon
Yeah, it can be a façade of some kind of temple
Na'u, right?
Or it can be a margin, right?
Or it can be a bandage for the forehead
Why would it be the word for a bandage to the forehead?
It's the forehead thing
You want to see what they did with these bandages?
They put drugs in them
Why?
So you could get Christed
You get it?
It runs into your eyes to people
Right out of the cloth
You don't have to make later on incisions
Which is the way the priestesses do it
You make incisions, you cover it that way
No, no, no
You take this in directly through the eyes
And if the light that in your eyes is singular
Then the whole body is full of it
You didn't get that until just now, did you?
No, you didn't get it
Because you're not a cultist
Yeah, fine
Now you're a cultist, right?
Satanic congregation, you know you love it
You know you love it
Let's get to something else really, really exciting
Give me another one
Give me another one up there
There's the bandage, we already saw that
Give me the next one
Watch this, people
It's also aromatic Egyptian ointment
Right, that you've got
You call it metopon
Right, but it's an actual ointment
Dyskorty's talks about it
Right, cool, cool, cool
Give me the next one
And what happens here?
Oh, I wanted you to see that
This calabane is the resinous juice of all hill
They call it tanakes
This is involved as well
Alright, so I got this forehead thing going on
It's Christing me, and I got drugs
Okay, fantastic, give me the next one
Here's your ponox, by the way
It's just the all hill
They used to call it all hill
Just, again, a very prominent drug
Look at the different
Orobacius is there
He's a physician, nobody reads him either
He was Julian the Apostate's physician
He actually dealt with the oracle
Directly, he's one of the last people
To ever work with an oracle
So, yeah
And give me the next one
Both, there's more and more drugs
Now, remember, what have you been advised to do
In the apocalypse, in the event of the apocalypse
What does Jesus, the Christ, the Son of God
What, and I'm about to give you a curveball
That's gonna shock you
What would Jesus Christ recommend that you do?
This says he recommends that you put the Cholurian
In your eyes
That you in Christ yourself
Okay, in order that you are not injured
Okay, the Christing is to prevent you
In the apocalypse from injury
You got it, fantastic
Let's go to the next one
This is beautiful, once you get the actual
Ancient words, I wanted to bring out
Because he says you're gonna have this in your hand
Right, look at these people
First of all, I just want to introduce you to the Phoenicians
We don't talk about Phoenicians a lot
But they're there
And notice that the Phoenicians are inhabitants
Of course, Phoenicia, thank you very much
Their chief city being Sidon
They appear in Homer as traders
Skillful in navigation, famously like for artistic skill
And for who?
Privacy? No
Piracy
Wait, what?
You mean like Johnny Depp? No
They're known for taking the booty
The lace
These are lace ties? Yes
These are the pirates
The Phoenicians people
They're the drug traders of antiquity
Isn't that nice?
They're not a nation
It's silly enough to think that they're a unified nation
You're in the wrong universe
No, they're groups
Groups of drug traders
Yeah, they traffic
That's why they're called pirates
Fantastic, keep going
And just in case you thought
This is a little bit of...
Talking about the Phoenicians who...
This character who's Odysseus is saying
Look, I had to do certain things
And I had to deal with these Phoenician sailors
You know what I mean?
And what happened?
I gave them Leida
Does everybody see the first word on the third line?
The bottom? Leida
What is that? Leida
Look at that Umlaut class
Look at that Umlaut over the Iota
You know what that means?
That means you don't allow it to become a diphthong
Yeah, so it's not Leida
It's Leida
Nice, anyway, that's our word
What do you have to give to the Phoenicians to pacify them?
You have to give them the booty
Sometimes that booty is kids
Yeah, sorry, but that's a fact
When Jesus Christ says, I am not a lace-tace
After they arrest him in a public park with a naked kid
It's because the booty is the kid
Okay?
Alright, alright
The booty is the kid
That's... I'm just coming right out of the tax people
That's it
It's just right out of the tax
Give me the next one
They're gonna love this
They're gonna love this because I'm gonna throw the curveball
Are you ready?
Who is this?
This is Athena
We're back in the Odyssey, right?
This is Athena
I think this is Book 13
This is Athena
And what happens?
She applies her robdon to him
Remember, who's Athena?
She's the virgin
What's she doing?
She's following Odysseus around
And now she gives him the once-over with the robdon
And what is she doing with the robdon?
Everybody here knows that is an implement of Dionysus
And what does her robdon do to him?
She rubs it all over his little wavy limbs
And it burns up his flesh
Yeah
And what does it do?
It turns his gorgeous blonde hair
A dark color
Yeah
And it makes all his skin wrinkled
And you know he was hot
And that's what it says
The last two lines is even though he was really hot
Everybody knows Odysseus is very hot
Why do you think the virgin follows him around?
Right?
She even tells him once
It's your cunning
It's your wily cunning that really attracts me
Isn't that gorgeous?
It's a beautiful picture
Yeah
Anywho, what's happening here?
We're applying drugs again
Again and again and again
Hit the next one
Boom
Okay
What do you give to the muses?
You give them the all-gold fleece of the ram
Yeah
Okay, now remember
We're at the wedding
We're joining the church and Jesus
In the mystery, we're all working toward the wedding
The wedding is always on the fleece
That union comes through the words
The sacred song that is printed on the fleece
Using drugged ink
You want to see those angels?
Right?
You got to go through the fleece
The lamb of God is the fleece
Kind of makes sense doesn't it?
Give me the next one
Oh God, after this I saw a huge crowd
And nobody was able to
It was so big, nobody was able to number it
And from all the, where did these people come from?
They were from every group, you know
Every tribe, every people
They had all different languages
And standing before the throne
And before the fleece
And they were wrapped in white
And they had foiny case in their hands
What did they have?
What did these revelers and worshipers
Of the great and almighty
What did they have in their hands?
They had date poems
Come here, come here, biblical scholar
I just, I don't know what to do
You can't get it out of them
You can't get it out of them
Give me the next one and show me
Let's look at this word phoenix
What is a phoenix?
It's one of those Phoenicians that we were just talking about
Right, one of those Phoenicians, good
And they're living in Sidon, that's great
We've identified them as a group
So do they have Phoenicians in their hands?
No, they don't have Phoenicians in their hands
What do they have?
They have the purple or the crimson
They have the purple or the crimson
Interesting, what kind of things
Have those crimson and that purple
Look at the gowns and the flocks
You got that purple madness
Hit me with the next one
Let's keep going with the purple
And track it down a little bit
Look at this great Greek word, phoenix caimon
What is a phoenix caimon?
It's something that is stained
Right, stained red
They have the porfura
Which is that darker purple
And they have this phoenix con
That is that which is kind of reddish
It just changes in different pigments
Oh God, I don't know
I don't know the science, right?
But I do know this
We're to have that in hand
Wait a minute, curveball's coming
You're going to see Jesus for the first time
Give me the next one
I promise you people, I appreciate that
You've hung in this long
And I'm going to show you Jesus
In a way that nobody else can show him to you
Are you ready?
Phoenix chidzo
What does that mean to phoenix chidzo?
It means to imitate the Phoenicians
It means to be or do the Phoenician
You want to do the Phoenician?
Everybody's talking about Phoenician, you know what I mean?
You want to do the Phoenician?
What does it mean?
It means to imitate the Phoenicians
Uh-oh, look what some Victorian put in there
Of unnatural vice
Okay, wait a minute
I don't know, I don't know
Is this line bugged?
I don't know about this one
But don't worry, because one of our sources
Is Lucian on this
And Lucian is very happy to
Tell us exactly what it means
Give me the next text
And let me show you
It means to lesbianzane
Right?
So what is going on here in this text?
Somebody's being talked about
Is doing this type of activity
To lesbianzo and to phoenix chidzo
Right?
And to phoenix chidzo
What does it still mean to do?
Well, you know what the lesbianzo is, right?
Let's check it, Chewy
Just for the people who want to implicitly
To do like the lesbian women
Well, what does that mean?
Seriously, lesbos is an island, baby
What are those Michelinians doing?
I don't know
On lesbos, what do you do that's so
Well, maybe the Latin will help us
Look, philare
Philare
Oh
Right?
No, that's the wrong word, isn't it?
I think it is
Because philare means to do certain things
With the mouth
To produce some what became
Known as philatio
Philatio
And a philator
Listen to the Latin
A philator is somebody who performs philatio
Yes
Fantastic
So that's to les...
That's to do the lesbos thing
Yeah
Is to perform philatio
And give me the next one
Unfortunately, what is the...
Let's keep going
What does the phoenix chidzo mean?
Where do we get lost?
The star charts go on
Yep, it's the next one
But
What are we going to be doing with it?
Here's the unnatural
That was the unnatural part
Okay
Now, I want you to look at this text
And I'm just going to translate it to you
And I want you to create the mental image that you can
Fire cannot extinguish fire
There is a moist
Stinging in my eyes
Causing me to want to grab on
To that beauty
And to never let go of that boy
What is Aphrodite doing?
Oh, my God
You mean to foin it to do the Phoenician
Has to do with that little boy that was with Jesus
Do you remember what color the cloak was
That they put on Jesus?
Do you remember that little celebration
That little, here's the man?
Oh, you're going to see what it actually is
Go to the next one
Isn't it wonderful?
When you get down to the dirt of the language
All of a sudden it's like
That makes a hell of a lot more sense, right?
Everybody writes to me and says that
It makes a lot more sense of a lot of things
That I thought of were weird in the past
But okay, okay, and what happens?
Pilate took Jesus and he whipped him
It was something like this
Here, take this, Jesus
Oh, how's that?
Jesus, you don't make any noise
I could imagine it, you know what I mean?
Just give me a second to imagine it
Come here, seriously, pull that up
Exposed, yep, there we go
Here you go
I've always wanted to hit Jesus there
Oh, Pilate, what did he do?
He mustigos in him
He mastigated him
What does that mean?
It means he beat him
He beat him with whips
Are you ready?
Why are they doing this?
It's so mean
Let's see, don't the Romans have justice?
Yeah, they do, this is it
Are you ready?
And what do the soldiers do?
They made a crown from a canvas
They took that acacia thorn
That all those freaks are using
Who are doing the Phoenician
And they made a little crown for him
Put it on his head
And what else did they do?
They gave him a purple robe
And wrapped him up in it
And ready, here's the climax
After they whipped him
Give me the next one
He's got his robe on, shoot
He stopped eating the popcorn
Give me the next one
And what happened?
Jesus came out
And he was wearing
He's wearing the crown
He's wearing that purple robe
And he says to them
Look, here's the dude
Here's the dude
They dressed him
As a lace dace
They dressed him as somebody
Who'd be doing the Phoenician
And you know what it means
To do the Phoenician?
It means whatever Jesus was doing
With that kid in a public park
At 4 a.m.
And it happens to mean the language
To enter into sexual relations
With a child
In this case, a boy
Okay, okay
Give me the next one
You guys didn't
You wondered why a pilot was like
You know, make a show here
What does he work on?
Broadway or something?
Make a show
Let's make a show of this whole thing
He was giving them exactly
What they had arrested
And that's why the people
Reacted the way they did
What happened when he went out like that?
Yeah, the crowd wanted him dead, baby
They wanted him dead
Here he is
You know, you can't even touch his headband
Without getting high, right?
What do they do in their cult?
They put that stuff over the eyes
In the forehead, yeah
Oh, God, bunch of freaks
Bunch of freaks
Yeah, and so the Jews said
We have a law
And according to our law, this dude must die
And why must he die?
He made himself the son of God
He made himself a son of God
You mean he did what Bacchus did?
He did the mystery
The sons of God came into the daughters of men
And what did they teach them?
They taught them these drugs
Look it up, it's in Enoch
Fantastic, fantastic
When you make yourself a son of God
That is a mystery process
That involves a Christing
Yeah
And it involves young boys
It is a corruption of the Bronze Age
Original
You mean our religions are all Bronze Age
Worship of satanism
Yes, of course
What do you think they got all their terminology from?
The tabernacle?
Somebody just boop in their head
I know what we'll do
We'll build a tent and fill it with smoke
Get really high and hear the voice of God
No, it's much more likely that it came from a bush
That burned
Where you can see God's backside
Is it his birthday?
Give me a break here
I'm going to take a break
People, just enjoy
Yahoo!
Yahoo!
When's your birthday?
Everybody
Happy birthday to Yahoo!
Happy birthday to Yahoo!
Happy birthday, Elohim Hashim Jova
It was in the third century
Fantastic
Keep everything in perspective, right?
You got to keep things in perspective
Let's go to the next one
I know this is long tonight, people
But I wanted to show you some really good stuff
Because I know some of you got taken advantage of
Up here, what is the phoenix?
What is that?
It's the epithemata
It's the things that you apply
The things that you're using through the phoenix
Keep going, what does that mean?
Well, that's why I brought you this one
To kind of show you what are the epithema
That's the cover, a capital of a column
A remedy for an external application
Wait, what?
It's a shaft of an arrow and it's a remedy
Okay, think about that for a minute
Think about that
We're still with the oysters
We're still with that yos
Love it
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
What is the phoenix keystays?
Okay, here we are with Jesus
He's standing there
I want you to see the picture
Jesus Christ with a crown of acacia
That they're using in their rites
And he's got everything going
And they've got a purple cloak on him
So they can show you
He is one of these
A phoenix keystays
And what is that?
It's a dire
It's a dire
It's aware of the purple
Which is exactly what he is
It's what Pilate is showing you
Here's his purple
And what is it?
It's somebody who's phoenix key zone
Give me the next one
And give me a really precise definition
You Victorian knucklehead
Give me a very...
Oh, it's the same thing
It's just the unnatural vice
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Oh, God, it's not helping
Well, what is a phoenix oboptos?
It's something that has been purple died
You mean the Baptists were not dying people
In the waters?
No, they weren't
They were using dies as drugs
And then ritually bathing
And when the people came out
Of the ritual bath
They saw stuff
They saw uranos open
Yeah, we should go see it sometime
We can watch them
They get freaky
Let's go to the next one
So what are these phoenix oboptos?
What do they do?
This is a text that tells us
You must honor those
Who are Phoenician baptized
And bring out that light
Do you still have the...
Do you still have the voice?
Are you still using the voice?
Who are these people that we talk about?
These are the Furies, baby
These are the Furies who are going to become
Humanities
They're going to become humanities
And the chorus tells us
Oh, Earth, you bore this group
This generation of serpent toothed, nourished people
And what are they...
What are they accompanied by?
They're accompanied by a therotrophic dragon
With purple on his...
Drooling down his forehead
Wait, what did you just say?
Anthropologically, we've got a group of people
These are Thebans
And everybody knows that the Thebans are born
From the tooth of the serpent
That tooth is that stinging
It is that plague
It is the insertion of the poison
And that poison is carried by a dragon
And remember, the Greeks told us themselves
When they say dragon, they don't mean dragon
They mean a person who is a dragon
And what is a dragon?
Dragons guard monuments
They guard temples that have relics
Any kind of relic, that's what dragons do
They protect relics
And what do these dragons have?
They've got the purple coming down their forehead
Into their eyes
What does the purple do?
It blinds them
But at the same time
It allows them to see the invisible
Imagine that
Your dragon who is guarding your relic
Can see what you can't
Everybody in classics used to always say
Why is it?
Why are the dragons always blind?
Why are those seers always blind?
Guess what, people?
Those drugs fill you with light
You thought you just wanted to be healed
Of your depression, right?
They didn't stop there
They not only healed you of your depression
They filled you with light
Oh, God
Oh, God, let's get another one
Let's get another one
Yeah
Okay, go, give me the next one
Finally, what is Mary, the mother of Jesus?
Who is she?
She is the foinicodactylos
That crimson-fingered one
That crimson-fingered one
Why does she have that dye on her hands?
Why does she have that?
It's because of the group that she's with
She came right out of the temple
You and I were all there
We saw when they auctioned her off
Everybody brought their umbrella in
It was some kind of rod they were using
And they picked out one at random
They gave her, ding, ding, ding, you win
Bingo!
It's Virgin Bingo
Fantastic, but she was pregnant at 12
Maybe that's why they kicked her out
One of those angels that fed her
Yeah, didn't bring the right stuff
Because they're supposed to prevent that
You're supposed to be able to prevent that
In your priestesses
Not only that, but she could have had an STD
Because if they're not using the drugs
That the Greeks are using on the right
That prevent pregnancy
They're probably also not using the drugs
That cause you to help you to keep from getting STDs
Yeah
Yeah, so she probably had STDs too
Pregnant and STDs
Oh, poor Mary
Maybe that's why they paid her so much
Maybe
They paid them
They didn't pay the mother of Christ
How dare you blaspheme!
Yeah, they did, I saw them
Gave her a bunch of gold and drugs
Yeah, they did
Why?
Ah, they saw his star
You don't understand
Because you haven't been initiated
Fortunately, if we listen to Old Boy
And follow the path, you can be reading these texts too
And don't have to listen to a person like me
It's the way it goes
It's the one thing I can give back
It's the one thing
One beautiful thing I can give you back
Is Mother Greek
And her sexy, sexy life
Oh, God
Mother Greek is so sexy
1.5 million words
By the way, some of you tonight
We're at a talk where finally, finally
Neil asked the question to a great scholar
Of theology
And he said, tell me, scholar of theology
What?
What is the problem?
Why does ancient Hebrew only have 8,000 unique words?
And ancient Greek has a million to a million and a half
What came as an answer from that person
Was absolutely, timelessly hilarious
Hilarious
Oh, my God
Pure hilarity
Pure
Did you hear the answer?
Yes, sir
It was amazing
This is a science, people
Remember, we don't...
What happened?
Ah, somebody...
Use the force
Oh, it's not working
Help
Wow, I kind of like to look through
My name
No, okay
Let's go to the next door
Come on, people are like, get your stuff together
By the way, everybody who hates my camera
It's not my camera, it's my internet
Right?
I'm on a little bicycle on the side of the highway
I got 8 M.B.P.S.
Buddy
Fonico
Crocos
This is just the purple woof
What's the purple woof?
The warp and the woof
You know how it goes?
It's weaving
And look what they're making
They're making a zona
Don't you like a zona?
You know what a zona is?
I'll hang out in the blue fog
A zona is something that a woman wears
Around her breasts
And these things are ornate in antiquity
Aphrodite has such a cool one
That it's got a barb on it
And the barb is colored with, guess what?
The burning purple
And she can take it
And she can take it off
And she can hit you with it
And you know what happens
When Aphrodite hits you
With those...
That lingerie, right?
Sastis is the one that goes around her...
What would you call it?
Her private parts?
Yeah
And the zona is the one that goes around her breasts
Yes
And the one that's down there has a...
Has a barb
That's the barb one
And that one is...
It hits you and it stings
They call it the kestis
Some people say sastis
And what does that thing do?
It causes you to love
Isn't that something?
It causes you to love
Not necessarily a good way
In an anguish
An anguishing way
Remember the guy that we were reading tonight
Who was talking about his boys
And doing the Phoenician thing with them
And he was like
Ah, it stings my eyes
I can't get it out at all
It's the moops in my eyes, baby
What's the moops?
Is the oysters, the gadfly
That stings
When Paul is talking about a thorn in the flesh
It's because he has a boy
This is the way
Sorry
Made myself a little...
Let's go
I can do this
The images are not too overpowering
Yeah
And there was a woman, Lydia
And she's the one who supported Paul
I just want you to see on that first line
What is she?
She's the local dealer
She's the Thyatyrin dealer of purple
People, I am showing you
An ancient drug dealer
Ancient drug dealer
Her name is Lydia
Oh, and by the way, she's rich
She is rich
You know what she can do?
She can send this guy around
Paul
She can send him around
Across vast distances
To go take his message to the world
She's paying for it
How does she pay for it?
She deals with the purple, baby
You shut up
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
We've got two more
Porfupoles
Look, in case you didn't believe me
Right?
Please
Please understand
We have to work with the Leicester
The pirates
We have to work with them
Right?
You thought Phoenicians were sophisticated
No
They are dealers and drugs
They are dealers and drugs
Stop romanticizing
And creating a fairy tale
She is rich
Off their flow
Of drugs
And the Romans
The Romans have had enough
Of the Leicestace
Why?
Because they're taking children, baby
They're taking children
The dude was arrested in a public park
With a naked kid
And you suck his blood and flesh
Every weekend
Every one of your saabats is full of it
Oh, God
Give me the next one
What else?
There's that dyed purple
What is dyed purple?
It's that skin, baby
It's that ram skin
Give me
Give me
And finally
Somebody's got to have those dyed feet
Probably Demeter
Demeter is the one we're talking about
From that ripe corn
Now they didn't have corn
That's a new world thing
When Brits say corn, they mean wheat
They mean wheat
Wait, we're talking about purple wheat
What it says?
We're talking about that purple wheat
Do you know how to prepare it?
No, you don't
No, you don't
But don't worry
That's what those virgin priestesses are for
Right?
Until they get pregnant
Then out you go
Right?
Out you go
Off with your head
They call that the Saturnian Reaping
The Saturnian Reaping
Oh, okay
Give me the
Nope, that's okay
Give me finally
Oh, I want to change
Hang on
I've got to change
Did we do this one?
Yeah, that was it
Yeah, that was Demeter
Right, why are their feet that way?
Why is Hecatease?
I read an explanation once
It was direct and talked about the right
And the fact that these Linnaean Bacchic rights
That they're going to involve this kind of thing
Where your feet end up getting stained
Baptize my feet, baby
Love it
Okay
Ooh, that sounded creepy to me
Let's go
I don't know
I guess you had to be there
Give me
People, bear with me
I'm going to go get the DI
And as I do so
I want you to watch
Happy Birthday one more time
Yahoo
Yahoo
When's your birthday?
Everybody
Happy Birthday to Yahoo
Happy Birthday to Yahoo
Happy Birthday, Elohim Hashim Jova
It was in the third century
Alright, thank you for having me tonight
Now, listen to me very carefully
You saw an example of somebody tonight
Old Boy
And Old Boy had the guts to work through this program
To go completely through the initiation into Ancient Creek
Has he been working on it for a while?
Yes, of course he has
Guess what?
We all are
Right?
I am
I've been doing it for 35 years
And you know what?
I still work on it every day
Every day
That's how you keep up your training
That's how you keep strong
That's how you keep ready
You pass those PTs and you're ready to go
That's what you're for
Right?
If you've got what it takes to make it through
Intensive Creek
Now, this is our fourth session
We have come through one unit in four sessions
Are we going to take so long on the other sessions?
No
On the other units?
No, absolutely not
I'm going to compel you to run forward
Some of you are saying
It's a little bit slower than I thought it would be
Yes, unit one must be complete
What are the things that you need to know?
Now, I've been dealing with office hours
And visits from people who are involved in OMNU
And want to know where am I?
What kind of progress?
Am I doing the right thing?
So I'm going to tell you tonight
The right things that you should be doing
Everybody has had plenty of time
To read the introduction in unit one
I told you for the introduction
Do not bother with the accents
You and I will work on accents together
Don't worry about accents
The history of the language, that's great
You've gotten a little bit of pronunciation in
You looked at your diphthongs
You got your alphabet down
That was the intro
In unit one, you started looking at nouns
Nouns of the first declension
Nouns of the second declension
Feminine nouns of the first declension
Masculine and neutered nouns of the second declension
That's what you must know
You have just been given the ability
To look at the words and to sound out a word
I want to show you what you should be able to do
It is the benchmark that you will rise to
In order to continue on to unit two
We're all going to have a test after unit three
People who don't run my course in three minutes
In thirty seconds are gone
Which means what?
It means you're all going to run it in three minutes
In thirty seconds
Because you all have what it takes
To get through this
Fantastic
Give me the first one
You have just learned putting together words
Actually, I want to go to the vocab first
Give me that one, please
You have just been learning to put together words
To take letters, individual letters
And string them together
I want you to look at the top word
I'm just going to pronounce it for you
Agorah
Agorah
And what is there?
The nominative is there
The nominative case, agorah, followed by the genitive
Agorahs
And then finally, the definite article
Hey, the word for the is there
Fantastic
And what is that agorah?
And I know you're there
You're like, it's a marketplace
Now, where are you?
If in Greek at this point
You can look at this word at the top of the page
And you can sound it out to yourself
Agorah
And you can tell yourself it's a noun
And it means marketplace
Then you are performing a peak
Okay?
That's where you should be
Fantastic
Adelphos
Look at the next one
Adelphos
Adelfu in the genitive
Ho
Ho
I don't care if you can deal with your spell genitive now
I just want you to know
That second part of the noun
That's the genitive case
Fantastic
Look at the third word
Oh, what is the Adelphos?
Brother
Anthropos
Person
Biblion
Book
And what is Biblion?
Look, that's the second declension
Neuter noun
You should know it's second declension
I'm going to show you the first and second declension charts
That you should have memorized by this point
I know, people are sitting there
He's taking too long
Shhh, stop
Trust me, please
You ready?
Doron
Underneath that
Doron
That's a gift
Then you get three prepositions
Ace, ek, and in
And what do those mean?
I mean, into, out of, and on
Fantastic
What's the noun underneath that?
Ergon
And you're sitting there as you're watching this
While I'm standing in this blue fog
And you're sitting there saying
Hey, ergon, ergon
Work
Work, ergon, ergon
What are you doing?
The repetition is imprinting this in your brain
There will come a time when you're like
Old boy
And you'll be pulling down text
And translating them
Right?
And you will have to have base vocabulary
Base, this is it
And these roots are delicious
Look at Edwin
It means work, we get ergonomics
Isn't that lovely?
Oh, God
Ergonomical engineering
Oh, God, I love it
Look at the one underneath that
Phaos, God
Underneath that is a conjunction
Or an adverb, it can act as an adverb
Chi, right?
Meaning and or even
Good
Next one, please, Chewie
Give me the other vocabulary
You got to know, because people
Give me the next vocabulary
Because if you don't know the vocabulary
You're ruined
You can't go anywhere without the vocabulary
Right?
Look at the top one, logos
That means word
Under that is maché, battle
Right?
Naisos, island
There's your definite article
Underneath that
The first one's masculine
The second one's feminine
The third one's neuter
I'm going to flash that paradigm
This is one of the paradigms
You should memorize
Right?
Ho, tu, toy, ton
Hoi, ton, toy, stoos
I can say that in my sleep
Right?
I can chant that to myself
It's kind of nice
Try it for the different genders
See how it feels
Love it
Did he just...
Martha, did he just say something
About trying on a different gender?
Ah, what's the next one?
Hold on, that's a road
That's a house
That's a dude, Homer
By their way to teach
Pimpe, to send
Techna skill
We get technological from that
Right?
Good
Hora is the countryside
Or land
Psuche, sorry
I almost added one
Psuche is a soul
Tuche, by the way, is chance
Isn't that interesting?
And then
We get an interjection
Oh, as in, oh, my
Oh, my
Let's go to the next one
I want you to look at these charts
Then these are the charts
From unit one
That you will need to pass
The exam coming up
In two units
Are you ready?
These are first declension
Nouns, feminine
Techna, meaning skill
Look at the endings
How they change
And the genitive data
And accusative cases
Techna, techna, techna
Techna, techna
Look at the little iota
At the end of the dative
Under the eta
Right?
Somebody jammed a little iota
Under there
I want to hear it
Some classes say
No, you don't hear it
And I say
I want to hear it
Techna
And then techna
In the accusative
Look at the plurals
Techna, techna
Techna, techna
What do you need to know?
You need to remember these endings
So that if you see techna
With just an eta
With just an eta on the end
You can say
Ah, I know this is a nominative case
I don't want you to worry
Too much right now
About the nuances
Of nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative
You're going to be learning these
Right?
Right now I want you to be able to
Identify when something is a nominative
A genitive, a dative, or accusative
Now, you students at AMANU
Who are doing the Greek
And they will progress through the course
You are investigators
You are investigators
This machinery is logical
And you must have it memorized
You must know that an eta by itself
Is a nominative
An eta sigma is a genitive
You must know that
This is just logic
It has nothing to do with your ability
To be smart or not
Nothing to do with brains
Simply remembering these forms
You have to be able to recognize it
Now if you're lucky
And you have an idetic memory
You look at that one chart one time
And boom!
If you're like me
You got to run that course over and over again
Until it's in your brain automatically
Repetitio es mater schientia
Repetition is the mother of learning
Says Cicero
We must repeat these things
If I were in your house
I would bring my whip
And I would force you
To repeat these over and over
Until you were sick of hearing them
That's how you do it
That's how you do it
Yeah, a lot of people like to write it out
Write it out
Engage your hand
Right
Good, give me the next one
What else do we need to know?
We need to know there are masculine and neuter nouns
And the first column here is masculine
Logos
The last column is neuter
Doron
So if you memorize that first column
And that last column
You'll be in good shape
Look at the endings
Os, u, oi, an
And don't worry about the vocative
I don't want you memorizing the vocative
That little VOC at the bottom
Forget that for now
Look at the plurals
Oi, an, oi, s, u, s
Memorize those endings
Masculine in the plural
Oi, an, oi, s, u, s
What is the neuter in the plural?
A, an, oi, s, a
Do I have to think of that?
No
I need you to get it to where it's muscle memory
Where you can jerk that up
Just out of nowhere
Where your wife can come to you in the shower
And smack you
And you can yell out
A, a, s, a, a, m
Right? Why?
Why did you shout out paradigms?
Well, somebody was flogging you
Well, you know, it's a thing we do
Making an exercise
Family building exercise
Love it
The Bacchic family
The family that whips together
Stays together
Yes, fantastic
Fantastic
Let's go to the one underneath that
Did he tell them to do what I think he told them?
No
People
Okay
Let's do this the right way
This is the last chart that you need to know
From this chapter
It is your...
What is this?
Oh, my God
It is your...
What?
It's the word for the
It's the word for the
It's called
What's the nerdy name for it?
You know, they always come up with
Sexy, nerdy name for things
The definite article
Are you the definite article?
I think I'm the definite article
In the world of...
In the world of grammar
Amin is the definite article
I like that, don't you, Chewie?
I like that
Chewie was mad tonight
Because she was watching with the rest of us
She was watching
And she was like, really?
This guy has a PhD?
And I said yes, dear
But it's in
Theology and Bible studies
Right, this is why you don't have
International conferences with
Classes and Bible studies
Professionally, this never happens
Why do Biblical scholars never show up
At international
Classics conferences
You know, for classical Greek
Why do they never show up?
Because, you know
If you're...
How do I put it simply?
If your shit isn't good enough
You know, you're gonna look silly
And so they know not to show up
It's amazing, the level
The level of professionalism with Biblical scholars
Is grossly...
You know, it's just...
People overestimate it, but...
Whatever
Here's your definite articles
How to...
Right, when you can say that to yourself
And you can keep in your brain
Remember, you're keeping in your brain
Nominative, genitive,
date of accusative
And you say, I don't want to do that
I don't care
Stare at this chart until it becomes
Part of your mind
Until, subconsciously
Bringing up images of definite articles
Changing through the cases moving
And that definite article comes
A sexy, beautiful lady
And what does that sexy, beautiful lady do?
She changes
She changes through being the subject
To being she who possesses to being
She for whom something is done
To she who is the object of the action
Right?
Follow this
Nominative, genitive, date of accusative
Please
This is what you must know
For Unit 1
For Unit 1
Now, I'm going to give you a couple of sentences
Really quick, and then we're going to call it
And you're saying, wait a minute
You didn't spend enough time on that
Are you ready?
If you've done everything I've just told you to do
You will be ready
Now, go run!
Do it!
Ready?
Here we are with the exercises
Look at number 9
Echne
Kaeton Adelfon Pidewee Ho-Homeros
Ho-Homeros is in the nominative case
So that's your subject
Your verb is Pidewee
So Homer teaches
Who does he teach?
He's got to teach somebody in the accusative case
Because that's what the verb is acting on
And here we've got Adelfon in the accusative case
Homer teaches his brother
What does he teach?
Echne
You've got a dative
A little dangling dative there
Don't you hate it?
You've got a little dangling dative
You just want, boop, you know
Just kind of push it
And it falls off the tree
You know what I mean?
That's your dative
Do you want to pick pears?
Here's your dative
Echne
With skill
When you're translating datives
I don't want you to think about it
They're the indirect objects
I don't want you to think about it
I want you to say
How am I going to translate this?
I'm going to translate this
This is to, for, or with
To skill?
No, that sounds stupid
For skill?
Ah, that sounds stupid
With skill
Aha
There's one
Don't try to figure your way out of this jungle
Just do exactly what I say
And you will survive this war
Good, fantastic
Look at number 21
Ho homeroos
There he is again
He looks like he's in the nominative case
So I'm going to make him the subject
Ho homeroos
Jump towards you
And you get paidei
There's your verb
Homer teaches
What?
What does he teach?
Tonado phone
He teaches his brother
Now, here's the problem
You have two accusatives
Can you have a double accusative in Greek?
Yes
You can teach somebody
Something
And the verb is still acting on both of them
It's acting on his brother
And the thing at the same time
What is he teaching him?
Technane skill
You see how skill is in the accusative case
Because the verb is acting on it
Everything in the sentence
You could jumble this thing and throw it in the air
And it could land in all different order
And it would still mean the same thing
Do you see how solid Greek is?
Your English is based on word order
You use an inferior operating system
Yeah, you do
But that's okay
We're here to give you the new one
This is a much better operating system
Okay
And what is the Bibliois doing?
Well, he teaches them with books
What are the means?
Those are the books
Yeah, how are they learning?
They're learning through the books
Feel that dative
That dative sets those circumstances
It's going to tell you how is this action
Being implemented
Bibliois with books, baby
Love it
Okay, it kind of sneaks in there
Kind of catches you off guard
Alright, here's what I want to do
I want to stop there
And what you can do is the sentences
At the end of the chapter
I should cover enough of those
To hit every point
That that unit is trying to make
So if you go back and play those
You will get every point
That the unit is trying to make to you
And if you can translate those sentences
You're performing at maximum
Good job
Those of you who are doing this
And eating it up
Because I'm getting some email
From people saying, this is too slow
I just want to run ahead
Restrain yourself
Perfect your unit one
Know all of those words
You know what anthropology means
Because you know what an anthropos is
Do you understand?
You love it
You love this stuff
Okay, I think we've done a good thing
I think we've come to a good place
I want people to know
That our momentum
Our momentum is gaining
We're about to see some goodies
I'm going to have an experiment
For you Friday
Now I will have somebody with me
I'll have somebody with me
That's somebody you have not seen
Me with
On Lady Babylon
I look forward to it
And I look forward to the chance
Of being able to bring a cure
And to be able to help
With the gift that I've been given
Of being able to learn, study, and use
Ancient Greek
It's a great honor
Now several of you are like Old Boy
You've been through the courses
And I know that you are helping people
Who have lots of questions
People have questions
And those are good things to ask
People who have already been through the course
And you can reach these people on Discord
You can reach them on Discord
And they have great resources
They have great resources there
Whole pool of stuff, texts, all sorts of stuff
Right?
Oh God, you're going to love it
We will give directions
Can we post that somehow?
In order for people to be able to talk
To people who have been
Yeah, the Discord
Put the name up there, Chewie
Give us a hand here
So that people can find this
Right?
The public one
Right?
We want the public one
That everybody can go to
As if it were a museum
Right?
And can work with it
And you may be able to chat
You may be...
I know there are hundreds of us
But you may be able to chat
With people there
Who can tell you
Oh, you know what?
Just do what he says with that first unit
And you're in good shape
Do you know these words?
Right?
They can help you out
That's a very positive thing
They would be my TAs
They would...
Oh, here it is
I posted it
I didn't post it
Chewie, thank you
Link to the Discord
Yes, and remember, Henry Cavill
Chewie loves you
Anyway, yeah
Let's do this thing
Finally, thank you people for coming
I want you to have a nice...
Chewie spends a lot of thought
That is anchored in a lot of reading
And literature
And when she puts together these videos
That are expressions of that orphic...
That orphic singer
Who is, for us, a teddy base
It's important that you understand
You're being brainwashed
Thank you very much for coming
Everybody, stay out of the alleyway
I'm going to have a clip next time
Of the answer to the question
Of why there are only 8,000 Hebrew words
Which is absolutely delicious
So suckingly delicious
I'm going to have that next time as well
Thank you for coming tonight
I appreciate everybody's time
Who came tonight
And Hail Satan
All of my love
Burning up
Lavender hot stuff
In this thing
Madea's kiss
Click bang
High purple bubble roost
Burning up my love for you
Wandering star
Roaming with a sword
Going door to door
Saving all the children
High purple livin'
Blazing up on my love
Inhale deep
Take two puffs
Just a touch
Not too much
Should get on top of you
With a little push
Three days late
What happened to your face?
Your shit went flush
Go rub a duck
Latex purple
That could work you
High purple gasoline
Madea belly dancing
In the moonshine
Childless glowing
Rayman Zeus
Operator smooth
High fire gasoline
Madea medicine
High fire gasoline
Hail Satan come to see ya
High fire gasoline
Madea medicine
High fire gasoline
Hail Satan come to see ya
