Amazonian
Let the energies touch me
And now I am no longer the same
Oh, we touch me
Oh, we touch me
And what do I want
To flood my soul
Something I've been under
And how I know
We touch me
And make me yours
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
This is Armin you tonight
And I have the fulfillment for you
I have the fulfillment
Oh, God, you're going to love this
By the way, thank you, Teddy base for that
For that opening
He touched me, very famous
Very famous him
Yes, it is
Thank you, Teddy
Tonight, I'm going to bring you something right off the bat
I couldn't start our day tonight
And just let things progress and surprise you later
I wanted to give it to you right up front
Satanic congregation, this is a gift
From me to you
Now, don't ask me where
Here it comes
Joey, give me the first
We're going to start right away here
I'm so excited when it comes to the table
You know what I mean? You put a lot of time and effort into it
What is this? The Greek reporter?
What? New find may confirm that
Amazon's ancient female warriors existed
I didn't know there was a question
In antiquity there wasn't
These people historically
Were mythologized only
When the monists gained power
These are real people
And they've been finding these people dead
And if you recall
I told you they would
Are you ready? This is gorgeous
I love this stuff, give me the next one
Joey, ready everybody? Let's celebrate
What's this?
What's this? Blow it up
Oh God, new find may confirm that
Amazon's ancient female warriors existed
Look at how excited they are
Look at how excited they are
Look at that freeze
Look at that, that's gorgeous bra
Look at the art
The Amazonians are all over the place
They're all over the place
In antiquity
Oh God, we're fighting and we've got cemeteries
These people, we're going to find out
Who these Amazonians are
We're going to find out, give me the next one
What do they say in their article?
By the way people, this is fresh off the press
This is fresh off, maybe a month old
What do they find?
Excavations of surprise bronze age
Burial sites have uncovered
Battle-scarred female archers
Now if that does not turn you on
Something is wrong with you
Something is wrong with you
Battle-scarred female archers
You mean they're just female?
Yes, they're just female
Tell me about them
Come on, I need a bear
Leading some archeologist deposit
That Amazon's the famed female warriors
Of Greek legend who are largely believed to be mythical
Only you do, they didn't
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
We have specific examples of these people
Are you crazy?
The fairy tale of monism has so warped
Your brains that you cannot see the history
But tonight, we're not putting up with that
Tonight, no, no, no
It's coming off, it's stripping off
Just like we stripped off grade
Just like we sought for what it was
Just like we held down the tyrant
Tonight, we're going to look at these dead women
Oh god, give me the next one
Give me the next one
In Greek mythology, the Amazons were warrior women
Living northeast of ancient Greece
During the late Bronze Age
Between approximately 1900 and 1200 BC
The source of the Amazonian myth
Is classical Greek literature
Guess what, there ain't any other
There is nothing, people
Mother Greek by this time
Had so stifled the development of surrounding cultures
And their language that she was taken over
Let's look at some, give me the next one
As one of his twelve labors, Hercules
Has to get hold of a magic girdle
A magic girdle, what does that girdle do?
First of all, what's a girdle?
Yeah, that's the part that covers the beauty
And that thing is magical
It's magical, what do they mean?
What do they mean when they say magical?
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs are Bronze Age magic
I'm going to show you tonight
The real Bronze Age magic
So the people who have found the dead
Can know what they were up to
It's fantastic, give me the next one
We're getting the story time
You can bombard with images
But let's see what there is
So he had to get that magic girdle
Of an Amazonian queen, right?
Hippolyte, and what?
What, he had to get what?
He had to get her girdle
What is a queen?
A leader, a leader of these
Bronze Age dwellers on horses
Who were women
And their arts of the bow
Shape their very bones in the grave
Yeah, this is, I told you guys
This was here, I told you
And what happens, they found it
Fantastic, what are they going to find next?
Hang on, Achilles killed another one
Right, another queen
A leader of one of their groups, right?
That was Pentecelea, right?
Only to fall madly in love with her
Jerk, as he, you know, took off her helmet
And she's dying, right?
What a jerk, what a jerk
Get going, what's the next one?
Okay, now here's the hardcore stuff
People, just so you know
I'm not making this stuff up
Despite being shrouded by mystery and myth
Archaeologists are beginning to find
More and more evidence of the existence
Of these fierce female warriors
Yeah, the latest piece coming
From excavations of graves
In a Bronze Age necropolis
In somewhere, I'm not going to pronounce
In Azerbaijan, right?
Right to all our Azerbaijanis tonight
Right, because I'm going to use global people
To all of our Azerbaijanis
If we can penetrate that distance
Thank you, thank you for your work
We ate ganks to pee too
All right, here we go, here we go
The latest piece coming from these excavations
This revealed, tell us please
What it revealed, what are you digging?
From Azerbaijani dirt
Women had been buried with weapons
Such as razor sharp arrowheads
We know they were razor sharp, you know why?
Because they didn't have to hit you straight on
They would nick you
And that was enough to deliver the poison
Oh god, these huntresses
I love it, I love it baby
The women had been buried with weapons, right?
Razor sharp arrowheads, a bronze dagger
That's a candy, you know what I mean?
And a mace, bonk people, right?
As well as jewelry, dude, you got to look good
You got to look good, right?
Right, exactly
Following the discovery, archaeologists have included
There may have been Amazon women
Who lived 4,000 years ago, right?
And these ferocious women
Ferocious women, you say, whew
What a description, ferocious
Yes, they called them, get this
Man killers
Yeah, man killers
Yeah
Amazon women they lived 4,000 years ago
And these ferocious women were known
By their male-free society
And aptitude on the battlefield
Especially with a bow and an arrow
Yes, what are they doing?
They're fighting from horseback
Using the poison arrows
And you cannot escape them
You cannot escape them
They hunt
When they go out and kill men, they hunt
Isn't that awesome?
I mean, one of their queens
Established a temple in Ephesus
And it had an image of the Artemis
The savior
And all of her breasts
And I know you're going to say
We don't know
We don't know where those are
Those are probably not breasts
And you do that
You morons do that
Flop your little Nephilim
Nephilim, Nephilim, Nephilim
Oh, Anunnaki
You, oh
Oh
How is it?
Why is it?
Because that stuff makes for good merchandise
The reality can't be sold
These were women who kicked butt
Kicked butt
They made it
We have accounts of how they made it
They would have hunting parties
They would chase down the men
And they would select them
If you were ugly
You had a safe place to hide
You hid behind your ugliness
But you capture them
And you can kill them after you
Harvest
After you harvest their seed
Right?
And then you kill them
Or you let them go
And the babies
The ones that are male
We have accounts
Now some people are like
Okay, adopt
Right?
And they'll leave their male babies
You know
You got great attendance
At the temple of Elethui
And what do they do?
Remember, she's that old
That old goddess of childbirth
That Artemis
Yeah, surprised
I'm not
You leave your baby
And they adopt it
And that baby
He becomes a servant
Yeah, he becomes a servant
They raise him
Yeah, fantastic
If you don't do that
You eat them
You eat the males
Well, they even had a word
For these tribes
They're man-eaters
They're man-eaters
Now, let me remind you
This is not developing on the male side
This is not developing
You don't have a counter phenomenon
This isn't just a simple battle
Between male and female
This is something bigger
That's generating these women
In that dig
They found that the pelvis
Had been adjusted
It had been warped for the sake
Of riding on those horses
And their fingers
Some of the skeletons show women
Had used bows and arrows
Extensively, Hughes observed
That their fingers are warped
Because they're using arrows so much
Yeah, changes on the finger joints
Wouldn't just happen from hunting
That is some sustained, big practice
What's very exciting
Is that a lot of bone evidence
Is also showing clear evidence
Of sustained time in the saddle
Women's palvases are basically opened up
Because they're riding horses
Their bones are just shaped
By their lifestyle
Isn't that gorgeous?
What do we have there?
Look at the melding
You know why you don't get that with a man?
You know why you don't get that melding
With the horse on the male side?
I'm gonna say this
And every horsewoman is gonna understand it
Before I say it
You got testicles
You got testicles, Joe
And that's why we got no male equivalent
You got testicles
Boom, boom, boom
Up and down on the back of the horse
Boom, boom, boom
Part of that is the rhythm
And you don't want your testicles slammed
You don't, Joe
So you don't develop
And as a result
What do we have?
We have horsewomen
Who only need men for breeding
Wow
And guess what?
Their tech is the high tech of the day
Not only have they changed their bodies
What's some of the other way
That they've changed their body?
People say, oh, no, oh, no
I'm a modern hoo-ha
And I don't think the Greeks were right
When they said that they did this
Look, we have Greek accounts of what they did
And why they were called Amazons
Because they had one breast cauterized as infants
They had one breast cauterized
Before it could produce
Before it could develop
And why do they do that?
Archery, brah
Archery
They do it for the archery
Yeah, fantastic
And I don't care what anybody said
The etymology, oh, no
This or that, Hezekius has got some hoo-ha
Hezekius, shame on you
Right?
In this case, I'm going to bring the heat to Hezekius
Give me the next one
What are some of the names of the Amazonian women
Who are laying there in the dirt
In Azerbaijan
Which is our new favorite place
Oystrophy
Now, for all of you who have been taking Greek
And by the way, I want to say right up front here
Our laboratories are going fantastic
The language labs
And we've got like 40 people
From the last weekend session
A Saturday session
And on this side of the ocean
And on the other side
With the people in Australia
We've got 15 to 20, something like that
And they're doing exercises
They're going over the work
That needs to be done to get people firmed up
And this is successful
This is so far bigger than any program
Anywhere in the United States
Anywhere
Yeah, definitely
We have the most students
So I want you to take this opportunity
And realize that you don't have to watch commercials for it
You don't have to buy merch for it
You don't have to pay to get your comment up there
This is not...
The devil can't work that way, right?
He doesn't...
He hates prostitution
I can't believe that
In all of that history of the devil
You find out he hates prostitution
It's like ingrained in him
What are you going to do for money?
He kind of loves it though
Because he can throw out some coin
He can throw out some gold
Like a golden toilet
He can throw out a golden toilet
And somebody...
Somebody will crave it
It's perfect punishment
Give me the next one
That's your name
Oystrophy
And what...
Where do we get this?
Look at the root
People, you got the oysters
Right in the woman's name
You know what this is?
This is the maniac woman
On the drugs
Oh my God
What's your cousin's name?
Give me the next one
Tuxuanasa
What is that?
Ooh, you know what her name means?
It means queen of the drugs
Queen of those toxins
Now, if you had a date
With Tuxuanasa
And look at that
You can see inside of it
Is the old Mycenae and linear B stuff
Right?
Juanasa
Right, queen
Top ranker
Then no kings
And there's societies, right?
So this is the top
This is the top right here
Okay
And if you're dating her
How's your date going to end up?
Okay, you better
You better make a good impression, dummy
You know what I mean?
You better make a good impression
And hope she lets you live
Right?
Okay, when you wake up
Don't just remember one thing
When you wake up
Just know that it will eventually be over
Let's go
Where are these?
Where are they?
Okay, look
What am I going to do?
I'm going to bring up Homer
I'm going to bring up Homer
And I'm going to take you to the tenth book
Of the Odyssey
And what are we doing?
I'm just going to briefly
It's not going to take long
I'm going to briefly show you
This woman, writ large
You mean they had the...
They had Amazonians
And excuse me
I think I hit some of the panel over there
The...
If we tumble a lot of...
You know, hyperspace or something
Let me know
They had the...
We want to see that woman portrayed
And they had Amazonians
Right? The Amazonian...
A tribe of Amazonians
Right?
Because you're talking about
Very diverse groups
Of archers
Right?
Archeresses
Right?
The very word for archer
Is a female word
So...
A feminine word, I should say
That is...
It's used exclusively for women
Yeah, take that
Take that
All of you
All of you testicular
Non-horse riders
Yeah, you say you're a cowboy
But you're not nearly as good
As your 14-year-old daughter
She can ride those barrels fast
Than you ever could
You testicle dragon
Okay
What is that?
Your male dog
Okay, there you go
We got some...
We got some shouts
And by the way
As we look at this Amazonian woman
I'm not going to tell you her name
Until we absolutely have to get it
But here's the circumstances
That we're under
Odysseus and his crew
It's all men
Odysseus and his male crew
Have come ashore
And they're on this island
And they're tired
And they're crying all the time
These dudes are crying all the time
And Odysseus is like, hey, go yonder
And, you know, scout out
For what's on the island
Right?
So a group of them go out
And only one of them comes back
And this guy is crying
He's crying
And he's begging Odysseus
He's like, please don't send me back
To that place
Somebody abducted everybody
In the group
Right?
And not only that
She poisoned them
Yeah, she poisoned them
And Odysseus is like
I gotta go see this
You know what I mean?
Right?
He's gonna go
So he goes
And what happens
That's where we pick up the story
And I wanna give me that first Greek
Here's what Homer says happened
He says, look
Odysseus is coming to the sacred grove
Where the Tomatakirkes is
Where the house of Cersei is
Right?
This is late Bronze Age
Late Bronze Age
Before the Trojan War, right?
The Trojans had Amazonian women fighting
On their side
There was a contingent
Kind of like mercenaries, right?
Love it
And the depictions of these women
Oh, my God
There's one point
This woman buries an axe
In the head of a dude
Who's yelling about how men are superior
And all of his people are like
Huh?
Right?
Oh, God
It's so powerful
I love it
So Odysseus is coming here
And he says, look
What did he see?
He sees this Tomatakirkes state
Of Cersei is built in cut stone
Large stone blocks
And it's built on this piece of land
He says
You can see everything around it
Everything
It's in a valley, right?
And it's built where it can see everything
Up to the mountains that are surrounding
Like strategically smart
Now remember, this is the Bronze Age
Okay?
How much organization do you think it takes
To create one of these palaces
Of large cut stone
It takes a lot, man
It takes a lot
That's a lot of resources
That's a lot of transport
That's a lot of construction
Okay, so this person, Cersei
This is a special time for person
Let me get the next one
Notice that she's in a sacred grove too
That's the last one
Give me the next one
She's in a sacred grove
So the area around where she lives
Is considered sacred land
Yeah
You can just by walking into it
You can get to yourself a pollution
That could end up getting you killed
You could violate something
You violate a tree
You violate the sacred leopard
Next thing you know
You got a party of horseback women
With toxins and they're killing you
That's the way it is
Now you know why the men are crying so much
Yeah, it's scary
It's scary
Give me the next one
These Greek men are scared
They're scared
So now what is around this woman's estate
What is around her estate?
You're not going to believe this
He says there were wolves
Like mountain wolves and lions
And remember there used to be a lot more
In the Mediterranean and Greece
Lions and bears, that kind of thing
But not anymore, right?
Okay, so around them
You've got these wolves
Around the palace and lions
And what are they doing?
They're screwed in the head
Because she drugs them
She alters their mental state
Wait a minute, what?
She's got a collection
She's got a collection of wolves
And panthers and tigers
And they're hanging around
What do they do?
They're on drugs
Do you see the technology from antiquity?
This is Bronze Age cutting edge technology
Not only do we build these gorgeous palaces
Of cut stone, but we have drugs
And these drugs are coming from those arrows
Of those Scythian tribes
They're coming from their arrows
They're the ones who are developing that skill
That skill, oh god
Isn't it gorgeous?
They're digging these women up
They're digging them up
I want to go now
Makes you want to go, doesn't it, Chewie?
Give me the next one
And that's the one we just did
There we go
And what else do they do?
These lions and these wolves
They don't...
I'm translating
They don't rush up on you
Ready to attack, right?
Like it's normal
What do they do?
They run up with their tails wagging
They wag their tails
And fawn
They lick
They treat you like you're some kind of, you know
Something nice
Not like a snack
And that isn't normal
That is scary
You know what that does to people?
It scares them even worse
Right?
You can't just jump in and say, oh, lion
Look, he's nice
Right?
Oh, now how is she doing this?
She's doing it with mind-altering drugs
You mean you can alter the mind of a giant cat
You can alter the mind of a giant cat
You can alter the mind of a tiny cat
If you want with drugs
I'm going to show you the specific drug they're using
To do this
Didn't you ever think of it?
Look, you've got your biggest state
These men, every once in a while, these sailors
Wash up, what do you do?
You drug them
And you turn them into sex slaves
And the ones you don't want, you kill
That's the way, brah
We all know
That the male is inferior
We all know that
We all know God's a she
What in the world
Buried in Azerbaijan
Oh, my God
Give me the next one
Yeah, oh, yeah, here, there's more, there's more tail
There's more tail wagging
Look at this, what are the wolves up top?
What do the wolves say?
These are those wolves?
They're Krater Onuhets
Krater Onuhets
Krater Onuhets
Now, what does that mean?
Krater Onuhets is the root for strength
For strength
And they're Onuhets
Give me the next one, I want to show people what that means
Now, this is always mistranslated
Here's the word Onuhs
Right, Onuhos
Are you ready? It means talons or claws
So this thing is always translated
They have the sharp claws
They're very sharp claws, like Homer just had a brain fart
And he was like, oh, by the way, they have sharp claws
I don't want to do it with anything
But I thought I would throw it out there
Watch this, there's a specialized meaning of Onuhs
Give me the next one
And what is it? What is it that these dogs are?
In tiny, tiny writing
What is the Onuhs? It's the operculum of the conjulion
Which is what? That's the little mollusk
That gives you, look at the end of the sentence
The porfura
That gives you the purple
Do you know what happens when you purple a wild wolf?
He becomes your buddy
He becomes your buddy
You can drug animals and they will become defenseless
They won't strike back
What does she say the drugs do?
She says I'm giving you a drug to make you forget who you are
What your homeland is
Forget your family
Isn't that neat? Isn't that neat?
I want a giant palace full of tigers, I do
I know why Bakus is always riding the Panthers
I know why he is
And people are like, they don't even question it
Do you know why? Because the gods have this power
I'm going to show you the line that says that
The gods, that's beautiful, keep that up there
The gods have this power
They have the power to access the drugs
That are able to do this
Imagine, right?
Now I know you can raise
I think you can raise a leopard from the time that it's born
And it can be your friend, your great friend
But that leopard is not going to accept anybody who hasn't been
It's mother
Yeah, no, no
Unless you drug them
You give them the herbs that they need
To enter human society
Think about the woman who figured that out
Think about her, she's buried in Azerbaijan somewhere
Think about her
I bet she's called queen of drugs
I bet she is, I bet she is
Give me the next one
Oh god, we haven't even gotten into all the drugs yet
Are you ready?
What is it that you're watching?
You're watching a peloron
And what is that? It's kind of a fabulous, miraculous thing
Because when you see a tiger come up
Now most of us, a tiger walks up and is licking
You've never seen this tiger before?
You're going to soil your pants
You know what I mean?
You may just fall over
Just down a complete and total adrenaline hits you
You may run off, right?
But the miracle is always overwhelming
And these Bronze Age miracles are drug miracles
Cersei Christ Odysseus
The text says that
Yeah, oh god, oh god
Isn't it gorgeous?
Yeah, for the person who sent me something from Berkeley
I need to see those texts
There's more magical texts
Ones that I haven't seen, that they've got at Berkeley
That have to do with Christing in the eyes
And boys and stuff like that
Now I don't know, I haven't seen the text
And I don't normally talk about texts until I've seen them
So please, I need access to this stuff
Fantastic, fantastic
Now what's going on?
We're soiling ourselves because of the animals
Don't worry, they're totally on drugs
Give me the next one
They're totally on drugs
That's the pelore, right?
What is that pelore?
It's that prodigy
That thing that's out of the ordinary, right?
Oh god, and notice it refers to the Cyclops
Remember this miraculous Cyclops
With his Ku Klops
His vision is singular
Remember, he's the one who's making the arrows for Athena
If you thought Athena was not part of this whole Amazonian world
You're wrong, you're wrong baby
She's going right to the right people
Let's just show them the latest
The people are going to love this
Give me the next one
Who is this woman?
I want you to look into the face of the Bronze Age
Amazonian woman
And I want you to see what they said about her
They said, we don't know if she is a Theos or a Gunay
We don't know if she is a god or a woman
We don't know
Why?
Why?
At the level that she was at
You were required to be a god
Watch what happens
It's absolutely gorgeous
Do you have any good pics?
Do you have any good pics of her?
Oh, let's see it
Maybe there's a little bit
Look, we'll get a little bit of the warrior thing going
But I want to see her on a horse too
You know what I mean?
Let's hit the...
Yeah, we can do that too
We can do that too
I like that, don't you?
Listen people
These people were shaping the world
They were shaping the world
And we're just discovering them
And in our...
Look at what happens
You woke up this morning and you thought
Man and female, man and female
Man was going to dominate, blah, blah
Hu-ha, military, ho-ho, big man
Running around
You ought to look at Ukraine
And watch the sniper women in Ukraine
That's the homeland, by the way
The Sea of Azov
That's a huge region
The Amazonian women
Maraud through
Yeah, yeah
There are people there today
There are people who have the blood
Of these women
And when I see
I just saw a sniper from there
She got hit
Something, she stepped on something
Lost a leg
And she was in rehab
Waiting to go back
Yeah, half
You know, she's got a prosthetic
She's ready to go back
That's Amazonian
That's Amazonian
Yeah, Vlad, they're coming for you
They're coming for you
It would be wonderful, wouldn't it
If they could remember the black arrow
Oh, God, you know what that is?
That's another thing that they had
In these tribes of women
The black arrow
You can shoot it
From a distance
That you can't even see across
And take somebody out
The black arrow
Oh, God, what was the tech?
Where did they get with the tech?
They got plugged in
They got lions that, you know
Eat out of your hand
Hopefully mackerel
And what happens to Cersei?
He goes in
Odysseus goes in
But before he does
He meets a dude who's going to give him some drugs
What is she going to do when she's in the inside?
I don't think we skipped any, but
What is she going to do?
She is going to make this
Pramony and wine stuff
Which is kind of raisin wine
And it's always in a mixture that they call the cacan
So she's going to mix it into the food
She's going to mix it into the food
No, you're right
And what are you going to do?
You're going to forget where you came from
Imagine a person
And I'm going to show you the drugs that do this
Imagine a person in a state where they're so disoriented and confused
They don't know their basic identity
Yeah
What do you do when you bring that out of a person?
Here you go, Piggy Piggy
Come here, Piggy Piggy
It's time to clean up for sacrifice
Yeah, love it
Oh, love it
Love it
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
And so what happens?
What happens?
Look, Hermes catches up
Hermes, the god, catches up
He's one of the gods, too
That's why he has this knowledge that he's got
And he says, hey, don't go in there, Odysseus
Don't do it
Why? What's going to happen?
All of this bad stuff
And he goes through this list of things
She's going to do this
Anyway, he says, look, but I can get you out of this thing, right?
Right?
This is a speech
This is a speech by the dude that was really afraid
This is out of order
We somehow got out of order
Anyway, Hermes tells him, look, I want you to free your comrades
And I want you to make sure that you're okay yourself
Give me the next one
I don't know why that was so out of order
Ah, there we go
So when he comes on this place
Yeah, no, this is...
Just look at the second line
I'm sorry, people, I must have had something go on in my brain today
And I got all my slides out of order
What's happening now in the story?
I just want to tell you how Cersei is referred to
Look at the second line and the third word in
She is polypharmacost
She is... what does that mean?
Give me the next one
What is polypharmacost?
It's somebody who knows many drugs or charms
And look at what comes after that in Greek
The doctors
Who else?
Who else?
Apollo
And who else?
Now, look at number two, though
This can mean somebody who's knowledge of drugs is great
But it can also mean somebody who's given to the use of drugs
Someone who's given
So what is Cersei?
Not only is she knowledgeable
But she is an active user
Don't get me wrong
She is an active user
Of course she is
And what do you think is giving those Amazonian drug-using archerises
Real technological edge
It's that stuff they're on
They're bathing daily in the cannabis
That's a bath
You just have to take a bath
Everything else is on top
And you have to wonder how much
How much is enough to turn you into a god
So that your eyes are opened
Yeah
Remember what it's called?
Taking her out of your side
Taking her out of your side
Does anybody want to take an Amazonian out of your side?
Do you know the sound that Cersei makes when she gets violent with Odysseus?
Because she poisons him and says his mind doesn't go south
He stays conscious
She's like, huh?
What?
Never worse
You must be that dude Hermes was telling me about
Right?
What's going on?
Give me the next one
Yeah, hopefully I didn't get these so much out of shape
So this is, no, we did
We went backwards somewhere
We're going backwards in town
But Hermes comes up
He's the crusorapis
He's got his wand with the serpents coiled around it
Because you know this is all going back to that serpent medical cult power
And what happens?
He's coming to the house
And he's going to meet Odysseus there
And look, what is he?
He's a young man
He looks like a young man
With his first peach fuzz on his face
That's what it says
And he's got glorious youth
He's radiating youth
Peach fuzz
That's Hermes
And he's got the drugs
Hopefully, did he bring the drugs?
I want to show people the drugs
Look, people, Bronze Age drugs
Right?
That are being used
And he says, before he says, look
He says, I'm going to save you
From anything bad that this lady's going to do to you
I'm going to be your savior
He says
Take it all the pharma con esto
He says, look
I've got this incredible drug
And I want you to take it into the house of Cersei
Right?
And its strength is going to ward off
Your day of death
Yeah
It's a colloquial way they had of saying your last
You know, it's your last day, brother
Right?
This drug is going to prevent that from happening
Now, how did he get this drug?
How did Hermes get this drug?
Some of you have seen this
Watch this, right?
Look, something happened
What's happening now?
It's okay
She's going to take the drugs
She's going to prepare them
And what is she going to prepare?
She's going to prepare the cook
The what?
The cuqueo
The cuqueo
This is actually the cuqueon
The cuqueon
And she's going to put that in your food
And what?
I'm sorry
She's going to put drugs in your food
And she's going to prepare the cuqueon
Because the cuqueon is drinkable
Right, potable
And what is that?
Well, cuqueon is really just a mixture
And some of you have heard
It loses, right?
This is the big one
We're talking about the cuqueon
This is it
And sursey
This bronze age
Extremely influential
Powerful, crazy
Violent woman
She's the one who's using it
Remember the Alicinian mysteries?
She's using their formula
She's using it
And notice that it's a mixture
This isn't one simple drug
It is a mixture
Give me the next one
Watch this
She's amazed
When she uses it on them
It doesn't confound his brain
It doesn't felgo him
It doesn't mess up his brain
His perception, right?
Why?
Why doesn't this happen?
And why is this all going on?
Somebody's trying to poison that person
That person has an antidote
Why is it all happening?
Right?
Within the context of these lace dye
The slave making
Sexually dominating lace dye
The drug, he says
Hermes tells him the drug
Which I'm going to give you
Right?
This thing is going to be your salvation
You don't have to
You don't have to worry
Because he's got the therriac
Right?
To the death inducer
The thing that really screws you up
Now I told you
What drug this was
That they're using in particular
And keep going
Keep going
Yep
So, Argo Fontes
After he said these things
He pulled out the drug
What did he do?
He actually ripped it out of the ground
And he showed it
He showed it to Odysseus
Give me the next one
And what was that drug?
Right?
We want to find out
Well, specifically he says
The root turns to black
Right?
There's a black color
Or there's a black appearance to it
That it grows
As the root descends
And what is the flower?
It's white
The flower looks white
Like milk
Right?
And the gods
Who are the ones who get it
Call it molu
The gods call it molu
Or molly
Now don't think there's any association
With modern molly
Don't get excited
There isn't
There isn't
What does he say?
It's very hard for humans to acquire it
But the gods
They all know how to do these things
Right?
They know these things
Remember, Hermes is a god
And you say, wait a minute
These Bronze Age gods
Are people who are exceptionally knowledgeable
In the drugs
I told you when we looked at Enic
I told you when we looked at Enic
The sons of God
Remember that God can be a woman
The sons of God perpetuated
The knowledge of what the monist will say
This is the same group who talks about
Changing your school
So you're going to learn the Bible
Because the Bible is a foundation
For Greek democracy
Look
Excuse me
Julian
You were right, Julian
They will
They'll screw up your education
Don't you love it?
Don't you love it?
You're going to witness the downfall
We're going to all be reading the Bible again
Let's get as much of this as we can
Let's go
Let's go
What is the drug?
You say, what is the drug?
Here it is, molu
Molu, what is molu?
What is molu?
It's a fabulous herb
Listen to these jackasses
It's a fabulous herb
One of the later writers
Somebody said it was garlic
What?
Now look down at three and four
You'll notice you start getting plants
And authors like Dioscorides
Plenty
And if you look at number four
It's struchnon, specifically
Struchnon hypnoticon
That's hypnotic
See hypnotic?
It's sleep inducing
Well, let's go to struchnon
And see what that is
Because that's what's...
Remember, we're giving this to our animals
We're giving this to people
And dominating them
And beating them up
And abusing them sexually
Right?
I didn't say that
I was going to pull any punches
That's what they're doing
Let's see the struchnon
What is it?
It can be a winter cherry
It's several plants
The name of various plants
It can be a houndsberry
It can be a struchnos manikos
Wait a minute, I know what that means
Manikos is crazy
Manikos is crazy
Manik
So there's...
What do they identify this as?
Dioscorides, 473 gives us Dios
Deterastrimonium
Deterastrimonium
Aha!
Aha!
That's one of those belladonnas
Look at the next one
So that one makes you crazy
What is the one underneath it?
Struchnon hypnoticon
Oh, sleepy nightshade
Let me guess
That one is used in surgery
Yep
Yep
And remember
You can fumigate somebody too
Right?
So there's a lot of ways
Remember she's using food
She's using drink
And Hermes' warning to Odysseus is
If she gets you naked
She will cut off your manhood
She'll cut off your manhood
You know, you can ride a horse a lot better that way
You can ride a horse a lot better that way
I'm not sure how much...
I really enjoy riding horses
But I did it with them
You know, granted
Could I sit backwards, face backwards at a gallop?
No
Not even close, you know
Yeah
Yeah, definitely, definitely
My fingers would be misshapen too, right?
Give me the next one
Let's go to it
What else do we...
By the way, this phrase with the purpling is so common
They talk about being excited by being purpled
Your heart is purpled
It's agitated
Some kind of...
You're in a zone where you're up
And that's good because these are tropane alkaloids
That they're using in the detour, right?
In the belladonna
You've got tropane alkaloids
Hyosciamine, atropine, scopolamine, right?
That is what they're using to purple
To enter into that state
Now, you can understand why a woman under the influence
On a horseback who trained and lived all her life that way
And had to kill...
By the way, they have to kill a certain number of men
Before they can breed, right?
So you can imagine that this purpling
Brought out some traits of womanity
That are just over the top
Over the top, right?
Right?
That's what's buried in Azerbaijan
Oh, God, love it
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Let's hope they're not totally out of order
Let's see, what did I do here, people?
This is okay
What are you going to be served if you go to...
No, it's not your fault, it's definitely my fault
What are you going to be served?
Okay, she prepared for me, what?
Cucay, oh, she prepared for me the cacan
And it was in a gold goblet
Or a gold chalice
A gold chalice
And why did she do that?
So that you could drink the drug
And guess what?
That last half of the second line says
She didn't do it because she likes you, baby
She did it because she's thanking kaka
For you
Who shows the chalice?
Did you have a picture of that chalice?
If you people will remember
Lady Babylon is the one
Who holds the golden chalice
And what do we know that golden chalice is full of?
It's full of her porneia
You know the first thing Cersei tells to Odysseus
When she realizes he's on an antidote
One that Guy Hermes gave to him
The first thing she says is
I want to have sex right now
Right now
And he's like, okay
But you're going to promise you won't kill me
And she's like, okay, okay, hurry up
Right now
Why is that even in the episode?
People look at that and they're like
Wait a minute
First she tries to kill him
And then she tries to
She's drugging him
And then she tries to
She's beating him up
With her wand
She's got a wand
She's beating it
Maybe, I don't know
Maybe that was getting her going
I don't know
Maybe that's part of the whole Bacchic thing
She screams when he pulls out his sword
But she doesn't scream
With the normal scream
She screams with a Bacchic shout
She's prepared
She's going to take him down
She's going to take him down
This is going to get bad right here
Right?
Imagine this on a dating show
Halfway through the dinner
You know
She pulls out a rod
And starts smacking you with it
And you pull out a sword
And she's like, let's get it on
Right?
It never made sense
Until you consider
That we're Christing here
The text says she Christs him
Oh, God
Do you know what she has to produce
In order to get that porneia
For that golden cup?
That's a sexual act
It's a sexual act
Remember, her body
Her body is the source
Of the communion
It has to be produced
Love it
Let's get to the next one
This is getting in there
But she notices his mind
It's not working
He's not seeing the things
That he should be seeing
She's already got all of his men
And they're, oh, God
They've turned into pigs
They don't even know who they are
And you should hear the sounds
They make
Why do you need a man to talk?
With an Amazonian woman
You don't
They have no voice
In Amazonian government
And remember, the Amazonian women
Colonized lesbos
Right?
They built the intellectual foundations
Of lesbos
Wow
Does a man get a voice in that?
Man gets no voice
Why would you give a man a voice?
Look at those beautiful women warriors
Buried
They didn't need men
What'd they need men for?
They hunt men
Why would you let one of those things talk?
Did you bring the drug Ceterian?
Because this is a mating hunt
It's two months
What, at least one of the groups I was reading about
Two months in the spring
So if you and I are average Joe dude out there
And if you and I are average Joe dude
And we're on those steps
And we're just living our lives
Trying to survive
We've got to be very careful for two months
Depends on how you look
And I'm sure we'll get a shape
When you give a woman the abilities
To select a mate
After she's already slaughtered three men
Kind of puts a different spin
On the whole dating thing
And the whole selection process
You know what I mean?
Puts a whole different
And if you and I stay indoors for those two months
We may escape, right?
I don't know
Maybe if you're really good looking
I don't know
Maybe that's where you'd like to go
Hercules did
Hercules did
That's where he went
Yeah, he liked to wear
He liked to wear the dresses and stuff too
Yeah, he liked to wear them
Do we have that?
Should we bring it back?
Should we have that?
Should we bring it up?
Bring it up, where is he?
By the way, has anybody seen Jesus?
Has anybody seen Jesus?
There's some early texts to talk about
Milking his breasts
You know in the book of Revelation
That he's wearing a bra, right?
It's not a bro
He hasn't been drinking milk with steroids in it
It's a bra for his small but functional breasts
Yeah, they're a little swollen now
It's milking, right?
Usually they're smaller
The texts talk about small
Thank you Jesus
Wait, don't let him go away so quick
We love you Jesus
Here, how about some
As he's sitting there
Let's get some ambience
Come here Jesus
Come here, let me see those
Oh, does that hurt?
Poor guy
Let's see what happens
Let's see what these pirates are doing
Give me the next one
This is lovely
Let's just keep going
We only have four more
Three or four more people
Yeah, oh, here we go
So I'm fee poloing
There are some servants that Cersei has
Right?
And there's four of them
Who specifically prepare all of the banquet
Who is a dude or gonna come to
And they sing
Right?
And the dudes wander in
Hi, right?
Hi
And they eat the food
And drink the wine that she's made
And next thing you know
The party's over
And she stands up
And everybody starts beating these dudes up
And they don't know what to do
Because they're delirious
And they turn into pigs
They turn into pigs
Yeah
And what are these servants called?
They're called Dresterai
What kind of woman has a job where she lures
Drugs and abuses men
Dresterai
Give me the next one
What kind of people are these?
Surprise, surprise people
Drester is a laborer
It can be a working dude
It can be a working woman
Look at number two
A runaway
I.e. lace stays
Lace stays
This is the art
These are the young girl prostitutes
That we encounter in Jesus' trial
These are them
These are the apostles
Who are working for Jesus
These are those drug-knowledgeable teenage boys
Who ran away from their parents
Jesus came
Who's the last person to see James?
It was Jesus
He walked up and they left together
These are runaways, man
You follow me and I'll make you fishers of men
Everybody's been saying that for so long
I love to hear evangelical pastors
Who have never read the Bible
And don't know that Jesus Christ was arrested
In the public park with a naked kid
At 4 a.m. screaming, I'm not a trafficker
I love to hear them say
I'll make you fishers of men
Seriously, seriously
Okay
She's got four of these
And that's how the operation works
Why?
Because the sailors, they're going to crash
They're going to be abandoned
They're going to get ashore
And you know what?
The other side of the...
You know what we do in Azov?
We execute them
We execute them when they walk ashore
We execute them
Yeah
That's the world they're living in
They're digging up an Azerbaijan right now
Not the fairytale world
This is a real world
Where women, believe it or not
Can be in total control
Do you remember the oracles
That are guiding the Greek world?
Yeah, they're women too
Is there a connection?
Of course there is
Of course there is
It all comes down to the chemistry
Who's the father of Odysseus?
By the way, he's Laertes
This is what he's called Laertiades
The son of Laertes, right?
Laertes, it comes from the root
That...
Ah, not Ezekius
What's his name?
Oh shoot, I'll think of it in a minute
He's a Christian bishop
Who's writing and he says
I've been talking to the Greek historians
And they say this word is actually from Lyas
It's the word for booty
For taking booty, right?
So, you know, there's a lot of pirating
Going on
Give me the last one
Or the second or the last one
What else do you call Amazonian women?
I wanted you guys to notice
You call them antianera
You call them
Those who are the
Balance
Of the man
A lot of people would say
This is the equalizer
They are the female
That is the equivalent of the male
So that's why they put here
A match for men
I told you
If you didn't think the Amazonians were connected with Athena
You're wrong, she's doing the same thing
And
What's, you know, you can see it in the language
This is how you identify
Not only are Amazonians
Man killers
But they are the man
I don't want to say
Anthodote, they are the
Man balancer
Yeah, right?
Good, love it, give me the last one
And finally, just so you can
Just so you can appreciate
The toxotis
Is not an archer
It is an archeress
And it was used of
Atalanta and of
Artemis
Look at the Orphic hymns there
That's how close the mysteries are to us
Why? Because our God
Is a she
And she
Shoots arrows
And those arrows
Are laden
With that
Which brings new life
Okay
Love it
Let's not
Stay indoors this mating season
Who knows?
All right, let me call up your
Let me call up your drill instructor
Tonight for the Greek
And I want you to watch the ending here
But this is not the ending
Exactly what you need to know
From the end of unit two into unit three
And by the way, a ton of people
A ton of people are tracking with us
And doing this course with us
So thank you for that
That's the most beautiful thing ever
I'm so glad that nobody's making
Money off this. You don't buy my hats, do you?
I don't got no hats sitting around
Right?
Let's do this
Give me the end
Exit
Let's
Save your
Your
Every single
We pledge the name
That we owe
You
I
Never cease
Never cease to
Breathe in
I'll shout
I got it
To your
Oh
Oh
Touch me
Oh
Touch me
And watch
This was my soul
Something
Happened
Now
I know
Who you touch me
And make me
You
Okay, let's get down to business
I want to show you
What you've had and what you need to know
I want you to memorize these
Four verbs
These are the six principle parts
Of the four verbs
That they have given you
And you're going to create an understanding
Of these verbs and apply that
To all the other verbs you come across
In the future. I want you to memorize
Luo
That one I want you to know
Inside and out because you're going to use
That as your example of all other
Verbs
I want to remind you
That the third principle part produces the present
Luo, I destroy
The second, and it also makes the imperfect
So I was
Destroying. The second principle part
Is just for the future
And it means I will destroy
The third principle part is the heiress
That has simple aspects
I did something
I did something
I destroyed
The fourth is the perfect
I have destroyed
And if you augment it
With an epsilon
I had destroyed
It becomes plu perfect
Extra perfect
Perfect, I have destroyed
Plu perfect, I had destroyed
And finally the fifth and the sixth
Those are both passives, a perfect passive
And an heiress passive, we're not going to worry
About those now. It's those first four
Principle parts that you are learning
And that's going to jump us into
Unit three. We're going to have the next
Section, but before we get there, I want to do
An exercise with you. I want to do
An exercise just so you can know
And be comfortable
With some of the exercises
At the end of each chapter.
Okay, at the end of
Unit two, we've got
This one, and the people who are doing
The Saturday lab, they're going through
These examples with people.
Sharpening their skills. Here we go
I'll go.
You are a good question.
That tells you.
Tois de
Xenois
Tois de
D'horai
Stefano's
This is a
men and
That construction
You've got the men up front.
This is not something English does.
Right? You could spell this out
Like you're walking through your bog.
You could do this on
On the one hand blah blah blah on the other hand blah blah blah. That's not how the Greek is working
Right look at where the men is
It's at twice philoise. Look at where the debt is. It's at twice xenoise, and you'll notice those are both
Dative cases right on the one hand you got the friends on the other hand you got the strangers
So what the Greek does is it sets up a contrast and they are always doing this they are
overusing contrast and comparison
But maybe that's why they're so smart
They're constantly
Comparing and contrasting things and that's what you do with the men and the dead on the one hand the gods
What is kill lousy?
What tense is that so many quick thank you your head yes
It's a future and how did I know that because I know my principal parts of those verbs that I just flashed up there
And I know the first principal part is keleu and I know the second principal part is keleu so and I know that an
Usi is a future third person plural ending they
They order in the future
So the gods will order Homer
What now we need an infinitive we need a complimentary infinitive to tell us what we're going to do
What the verb is going to do they're going to order them
Him to what to pin pain
There's your infinitive to send who's on the accusative case gold on
the one hand
To his friends on the other hand
They will order him to send crowns
To the strangers who dwell in the countryside
Right love it love it so in this little sentence here
You have this extreme contrast between the friends and strange
How do you treat the friends you treat them this way?
How do you treat the strangers you treat them that way and that way the Greek without just saying the data like English would
Why English would be the gods first order Homer to do this to the friends the gods then order Homer to do this to the
What you've done is you set up a contrast right off the bat with the men and the death and you say wait a minute
The men doesn't come until half way through the top the first part of the sentence and the dead doesn't come until the second
That's because the Greek sentence is not
formed
linear
There's no linear formation
It's words you can throw them up into the air and as long as you see bing bing there's a
Con there's a contrast there. Oh
Okay, between what and then your mind starts to form the image
That's how the Greek is forcing you to think remember some languages are not
Are not up to this and ours isn't one of them at least mine isn't we've got some people from Thailand too
I want to say shout out shout out to the people in Thailand. Give me the next one
Hmm. What does this one say? Oh god? I just want you to look at the second word a killer with now
That's the same verb there right Kaleo, but you notice
It's from the first principle part if you knock the ending off s and you take the augment off on the front of it
Yeah, you get Kaleo and that is the root of the first principle part Kaleo
So you know this thing is from the first principle part and it's got an augment on it
So therefore I know it is imperfect and what is the imperfect? It's that past action
Right. I was doing something. You're looking. How are they using the imperfect? They're looking you're looking at the person
Actually performing the action. That's where your state of mind is you're sitting there with them watching it happen
That's the imperfect in the past and what do you say you ordered Homer to send Pimp sigh
There's your heiress infinitive now
Why they use and why they use an heiress infinitive there Pimp sigh instead of a present infinitive those the two we've learned
Right. Why did they do that?
Because of the aspect he's only going to be doing the sending once wait what yes
I can order you to send something to me every day
Right. I could order you to do that or I can order you to send me something once they are
Distinguishing that whereas we need a phrase to express that they do it naturally in their verb
It's in part of the nature of the verb the contrast is there
Right. The perspective is there Greek verbs give you perspectives
Perspectives fantastic
For why did he order him to do this for what?
um
Now, what is that that's that second person singular imperfect on s a woman at on
right for
You were teaching those men on the island. Yeah, right. It's nice gorgeous. Okay. Give me the next one
What are we going to get into in unit three?
We're just going to do the same thing
But we're going to go to the fourth principle part with the verb now
We're going to deal with perfects and pluper
Perfects
This is what you need to memorize for your perfect tense. What is your perfect tense?
I have ordered
Present I order
Imperfect. I was ordering future. I will order heiress. I ordered
Perfect
I have ordered
And these are the endings that you put on the fourth principle part
ah
Amon at a assi
You say wait a minute that sounds just like
The heiress it does except for the third person plural. It's exactly the same
Right, the third person plural is a little different assi instead of on but that's okay
It you don't really don't have to learn much new and of course in the third singular and plural
Third person singular plural you can have the new movable fantastic. Give me the next one. That's the perfect
I have done something and I just want you to see then using the the verb paide
Right. It's fourth principle part is pet paide al ca
Pet paide al ca I have
Educated and all you do is you add those endings pet paide al ca you have educated pet paide al ca
He she or it is educated pet paide al come in
Look how the accent shifts there, right? Nice. We have educated pet paide al ca te you have educated and pet paide al ca si
They have educated no problem. Now. I'm going to do the same thing
Only I'm going to make it extra perfect or plural perfect
Not I have educated but I had
Educated so it's already passed in the past
Yes, fantastic fantastic. It's really the secondary tense
of the perfect
Which is a
Primary tense when you say I have done something you're talking about right now in the present
I am in a state of having done something you didn't realize that did you that the perfect is actually a present tense
It is
primary
So how do you make that past? How do you shift that in the past?
You turn it into a plural perfect
You take an epsilon augment and tap it on the front of that
Fourth principle part and then you add a different set of endings and what are the endings that indicate the plural perfect a
a
