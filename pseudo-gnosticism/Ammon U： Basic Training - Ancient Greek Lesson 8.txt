All over but the cryin'
All that bullshit they were tryin'
Epic gates of Babylon, money changers
Clippin' tables, rearrangers
Hot purple slangers
Madea she'll work you, it's a banger
Smile away from the treeline
The man of rain
Ridin' into the sunset
My Madea draggin' venom
Chulin' the lotus
Amethyst serpent
The need for anti-venom is urgent
Athena work it
Seashell purple
Dielectric water flow

The dope is hot purple
Madea she'll work you
The circus an analima
Tuhefe est de masse
Heliocentric
Cult of the crow
Athena run the sky
For the Mio Maas
Try a little bit of death public
Cush on a chair head full of zombies

Madea she'll work you

Welcome back to the Lady Babylon
Ow, don't you love
Teddy bass, Orpheus
Thanks a lot for the song
Your craft, I appreciate it
Chewy, nice job
On the images penetrating
The brains of the people
It's wonderful, eyes wide open, right?
Thank you for coming back
And I want to bring to you tonight
Something worthy of your attention
I want to warn you right from the beginning
Get your splash bags out
Tonight is going to be extremely difficult
Now you know
You know it is a difficult
Topic
And it's not just one
It's a whole bunch
Right?
And Jesus
And Jesus
But tonight
We're going to do something
That may
Break the meter
So what I'd like to do
Is to be as professional
As possible
And to talk to you all people
As you're assembling
And to talk to you all
About
Something
That is so
Deep within the rot
That
We're going to have to completely
Just cover ourselves, okay?
So cover yourselves tonight
Get going, get it
Look, I had the ship going, we're going to get there
But I've got to tell you
At arm and you
I
I decided
To unplug
From my tutoring
Hut
I'm going to unplug
Because
The hut was taking
Was taking
Everything a lot
And
I need to keep the lights on
I do, so I'm restructuring
I'm going to fly
On my own
That's what I'd like to do
Those of you at Satanic Congregation
Who have written to me
Said, I'd love to be in this
Give me a place and time
Here's what I've got
Next week, Tuesday
I'll be starting a class
At my own studio
You just come to my studio
And what I'd like you to do
I'd like for you to send me
An email, do we have my
Professional email address here
Flash that up there, Chewie
So people know
Where to send their stuff
Right
The only thing we don't want
Is the nasty stuff
Not the nasty stuff, right
Keep it right
We fly, virgin air
This is wonderful
There we are
There's the address
I want you to send me an email
If you've done this before
That doesn't count
Okay, so here's what I want you to do
I want you to send
An email to me
As an application
State on the title
Application, so I'll know
This is an application
And all I want you to do
Is in that email, I want you to tell me
Where you're coming from
And where you'd like to go
And where you'd like to go
With mother Greek
That's what I want to do
And I'm going to take nine of you
I'm going to take nine of you
And I'm going to put you into a course
I'm going to put you into a course
Twice a week
One hour
This is an advanced platoon
That I am starting to generate
Now, if this is successful
I'll fill in
I can teach four
Of these a day
Twice a week without
Stressing my
Heart
That's about what you can do
Because it takes a lot of prep, man
And you've got to be in the zone
And you're dealing with people one on one
Boom, boom, boom
Right, so
This is a special
We've got a special dispensation
From the devil
I just talked to him
Fantastic
As my way of paying my bills
And what I can do is I can give it to you
In a rate
That's way reduced
Because when I was working for the hot
When I was flying for Jabba
Right
You had to charge
Crazy
Crazy, you're an average poor person
Look, we're poor people
Your average poor person
Can't afford Harvard
Right
Well, they can afford
Tutoring
They can afford tutoring
And it'll be at almond studio
Yeah, and I can get it to you
If I can get us to four classes
I can get you down
I can get you down to
You know, a rate that is
Just, you know, able to keep my
Lights on
And
Yeah, and otherwise
Feed
I love it, chewy
Love it
Yeah, I don't know
I don't know
This is what I'm having to do
I'm going private, so, but
In the meantime, I am going to
Select
The bravest
Those who will stick to it
And
Those who have that
Infatuation
The crazy of the crazies
Right, anybody
Static ring
I'm going to feed you
I'm going to feed you, Greg
And it's going to open your brain
Okay, that's what we're going to do
Twice a week, it's going to be a Tuesday and Thursday
Next week, so please
In the next few days, send me your apps
If you want
If you want, you know
And here we go, we're going to
Bring this thing to life
It's brought me to this position
That freedom from the heart
Means
Giving you something, right
This is compared to
Compared to any sort of
Education you buy
Right
This is the education that
Should be for everybody
And so, as long as I can keep my
Lights on, I can keep doing it
Because if they shut them off
I'm not going to be able to take flight
Everybody knows that
So, devil was like
Huh, yeah, I suppose
I can see, you sure you want to do that
I was like, oh, it was very reasonable
It was a very reasonable session
I was like, daddy
Anyway, give me the
What do I want you people to do tonight
We're going to go in deep
We're going to go in deep now
And I want to bring you these sources
And I want you to look at them
We are landing, what's the target tonight
Late first century into the second
On a domain
We're picking the time
Why are we doing that? There's a reason
We're picking the time
When
The
Accounts of the New Testament
Are being written, being recorded
So we're taking a sample
Of the language
The same language as being used
In the New Testament
And I'm going to bring you tonight
What am I going to bring you? I'm going to bring you
You knew what I was going to do
Okay, we're going in
To an initiation
And I want you people
To be respectful
To be respectful, okay
Nobody says anything
Nobody jumps out of line
I want you to see it
Through Mother Greek
It's gorgeous. Let's do some comments
First, where did those other two go
That you brought? Did you put those up or no?
No, those other two comments
Okay, you did
This is the second Bible scholar
Who has made their field look like a joke
I thought he was going to have a legit
Rebuttal to Armen's claim
Of the child trafficker, but no
That word just means something different
In New Testament Greek, it's called street Greek
Lol, it's meaning
In all other Greek books
Doesn't matter. Yeah, exactly
So here's one side of the coin
You see that? This is a person
Who's handling the evidence
Right? And looking to
The people, the detractors
To say, what
What can I do with the evidence? They don't
They never do. It's what makes us
So strong and them so weak
Okay, now this is the other side of the coin
Give me the next one. Watch this
Amen Hillman is not a biblical scholar
And his expertise does not
Apply to biblical scholarship
You're right. My expertise
Doesn't apply to biblical
Scholarship
And I'm glad that it doesn't because
Your garbage is so
Bad that the head of Dallas
Seminaries, Greek program
Wouldn't come on the air to talk
To me about what a Christ
Is
Yeah, weak
Weak stuff
Okay, next comment
Next comment. Oh, what is this?
Who is this from? Hanya
Like that
Was dosing off in bed and woke up
To keep it hard all the time
Now I'm wide awake
Do you see?
I told you I would come to you in your dreams
More important
Than a love letter
Is the train visit
Yes, oh my god, what is
He talking about? Give me the next one
Give me the next one
I don't think I've ever seen a podcast
With an actual non-human intelligence
I resent that
Non-human intelligence
Until now, wait, does that mean
Oh, I see, there's a reason
It knows so many ancient
Languages and is
Wearing that man like a robe
It's a
It's a demon
Possession, right?
Who do you think I'm possessed by?
Who do you think
I'll give you one guess
One guess, I'm the one
That slept with Eve
Oh god, don't you love it?
Isn't it gorgeous?
Isn't it gorgeous? You understand
What it means for me to take her
Out of my side now
And I'm going to show you that kind of stuff
I'm going to show it to you now
We're going to
To Lucian
To Lucian and the classicist will argue
They will say
Is this pseudo-Lucian
Or is it Lucian, right?
Is this pseudo-Galen or is it Galen
Oh god
Okay
We'll go to this pseudo-Lucian
Or possibly Lucian
Personally, I think it's real Lucian
But we'll go to this source called
The ass
The ass
The ass
We're going into Lucian's ass tonight
And we're going
To pull out
Something marvelous
Something marvelous
Are you ready?
Are you ready to go into the ass?
Right?
Everybody know, get your ears on
Get your ears on
Would you be surprised if I told you
We were all going to watch some people
Get Christed tonight
Mmm
You've never been to one of these services
I told you, I told you
Come on, splash bags
We're getting them going
It all comes down to this
Bump, bump, bump
Right?
It's the verb
It's the verb in Greek
And what is it for?
It's the verb to Christ
It's the verb to Christ
It's why you call it Jesus
A Jesus Christ
Jesus
Jesus Christ
Amen
You didn't see that
Prayer coming, did you?
Okay, let's do it
It's all because of this
It's brought to you by this
This verb here
Can you tell from my body language
I'm not that smart
Look, it's all from this verb
And this thing goes back
It goes way back
Let's not go all the way back
Let's go halfway back
Where does it go?
Who is Io? She is the cow
In Oistras
And she's yelling out
And she's saying, what kind of
Oistras is Christing me?
Can you see
The vision
Of the many-eyed God
Yeah
What
Is Io, whose name, by the way
Is a shout
It's a
Sacred shout
And what is she saying?
She's dealing with the Oistras
She's dealing with the drive
Now do you feel it?
Can you feel that drive?
Oh man, this is life
Right, this is...
Feel that vibration
Wow, this is life
Give me the next one
Where else can we see the Christ?
If you go way back
Into the Odyssey
You can see Christ in the Odyssey
And what's going on?
It's Odysseus
Look at the last word in the first line
Greek students, Odysseus
Odysseus
Odysseus
And what is he doing? He's out looking for
Pharmacon
He's out looking for drugs, yeah
The kind that kill people
Why?
Because he wants to Christ his arrows
He wants to Christ his arrows
Do you see?
It's the first place
We find Odysseus
The first time! What is he out doing?
He's out looking for the substance
That he's going to use to Christ his arrows
Where did he learn that stuff?
You would think
Maybe Penelope was some kind of
Amazonian
Oh god, he's whimpering a lot though
And they traded him around
The women traded him around
Oh, there's Amazonian
Love it
Find all their stuff
It's coming
They're going to find them telling you
It's at the bottom of the black sea
Just keep looking
Gents, keep looking
Ladies, keep driving
Find us those tools
That they used
You'll find little pots of stuff
To analyze it
Keep going
It's so fantastic when you know
People, I'm going to bring you the dirty dirty
Right now, are you ready?
This is Lucian's
Ass
And by the way
There is a general form
And a specific form
Of that definite article
So
Lucian's ass is a much better title
Thank you very much
Thank you to this excellent reader
That was
Created
By some nerd classes
Thank you very much
Thank you very much, dudes
At least somebody, Hayes and Nimis
Right?
Are doing
Are doing something
Nice job
So, Pat's off to you tonight
That's what we're bringing
Love it
You don't have to buy a t-shirt, right?
Okay, I'm going to introduce you
The first character
Who are we talking about?
We're talking about a Paidi Scarion
Named, Palaistra
Do you want to show them
Palaistra?
Named Palaistra
What is a Palaistra?
It's a girl
You see the root
For child
In it
A 12 year old
Girl
Okay
Right
And bring me back
That Greek, what?
What's so interesting about her?
Well, look at her name
Palaistra
You know what that means?
That means the place you go to wrestle
And wrestling
And mother Greek
Go hand in hand
Grip on grip
This is Palaistra we're talking about
She's a Paidi Scarion
Okay
Let's appreciate
The anthropology
Of what's in the language, please
Hit me the next one
What do we say in the ass?
Well
Here's what
Stop, stop, it's not meant to
It's not meant to laugh, right?
I'm sorry
Look at me
So she's laughing
There's a woman
She says, look here
Who are we talking about?
You don't need to worry about characters
There's one character you gotta worry about
His name is Lucian
Lucian, what is he doing in life?
He's traveling, he's a kid
And he's traveling to this region
In order to
Investigate witchcraft
He really wants to know about the witchcraft
And what they're doing
And by that I mean the pharma chaos
What's the stuff they're doing?
Cause it's always involved with drugs
And there are lace stays involved
Lace die I should say
That's the plural
There are lace die that are involved
And there are drugs that we Christ
Do you know why we Christ?
Right?
I'm gonna show you a troop
Of children
Led by an old
Dirty dirty person
What do we call these people?
The canitis
Is the ancient Greek word
What is a canitis?
It's somebody
Who dances the dance of the bottom
There's an ass involved
He'll bring
The ass to
His mathetai
His apostles
Do you see what's going on?
Did you really want to see the right?
I told you tonight
I told you it's scientifically
Horrific
Scientifically horrific
Using the same language
That you know who
Is using
The dude that was arrested
In the public park at 4am
What was his name?
Jesus
Jesus
What was he doing?
He was Christing
Are you ready?
Are you ready for this?
Give me the next source
The one I got my glasses on
She's smiling
This woman who's warning him
He's not looking for a witch
She says look
I got a warning
She says you gotta be careful
Watch out for yourself
Because of the woman
This gunayka
Of Hipparchus
Where he's staying
In every sort of way
This woman is talented
She is a magus
And a terribly frightening one
Why?
Because she's mochlos
Can you feel it out there?
What is mochlos?
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about
You know what I'm talking about
Uh-huh
And who is she mochlos for?
She's mochlos
I want to read this literally
So that people don't send emails
Watch this people
Are you ready? Who is she?
She's mochlos pasitois naois
Woo
She's mochlos
For all of the boys
Nice
Those beautiful boys
She's a magus
She puts her eyes on them
Nice like a huntress
And if anybody ever messes with her
She totally
Avengers herself
With her talent, her skill
She turns these boys
Into
Pure animals
Pure animals
Wait, you gotta blow it up still
She turns them into animals
But if she sees one of these
Kids and it uses the word
Techno in there for the kid
If she sees one dude is handsome
Right
And she's trying to convince
Lucius, she says you
You're handsome, right? You're a kid
What's gonna happen?
You're gonna be food for her, right?
This is a
Pragma
This is something anybody can put together
It doesn't take a genius
To put this together
Look, you're a kid
Just like she likes
You gotta be careful
She's got the magic
She will
Drug you
She will drug you
She'll do something to you up here
She'll change you
This is Amazonian power, brah
Why do you think Odysseus
Is out looking for these arrows?
Why do you think he's out
Looking for this poison?
You know what this poison
Does to you?
Have you ever seen
An aroused Jesus Christ
Depicted in any sort of
Medieval art?
How about classical?
As far back as we can go
To the first century?
What's the image
Of Jesus Christ that we
Gonna call this up from the ether
What's this image?
Does anybody else smell the brimstone?
Come here
We're spanking Jesus
Jesus Christ
I love to spank you Jesus
I can see it
In my mind's eye I can see it
I can see it, it hurts him
Every time I do that
As above so below baby
He spanks Jesus
Martha, oh my god
Give me the next one
What's going on?
Somebody's getting naked
Right? Somebody's getting naked
We're gonna go
To polystra
We're gonna go
To that place of wrestling
One of those wrestling
Academies, what are they?
Dude, they are the places
Where we educate
Where we educate
What does he say here?
It's better
Look, Lucius, he just
Wants to find out what the magic is
He just wants to find
He wants to peep in
And he ultimately gets led
To peeping in
As a peeping Lucius
He's peeping in on
Watching what this woman
Is doing
And it's spectacular
He wants to have the Christ thing
Are you ready to watch your Christ herself?
Have you ever seen somebody Christ themselves?
Oh, you're gonna be surprised
Splash bags out
Here we go, give me the next one
Give me the next one
Okay, so look at this
Upon returning home, he discovers
Polystra alone and the two exchange
Amorous Barb's planning a rendezvous
After the Masters are asleep
So this is a teenage kid
Male and a
12 year old girl, female
And she is in the
Position of the slave
She's in the position of the slave
That's the assistant
The house assistant
To this master and his wife
That uses magic
And so Lucian is like, oh, you know
Who's gonna know? That's part of what that Greek said
Who's gonna know
That it's the things that they do
Right, it's the things that they do
The slaves
This was above, the slaves
It's the things that they do
What do they know?
What do slaves know? Look at that last line
They know
Both the good things
And those, you know, things that you want
To keep secret
That's what slaves learn
Right? Fantastic
Let's see what Polystra does
Give me the next one
You're brilliant, Lucian
You're brilliant
Thank you
So, what do they say?
They perceive it, you know
The husband and wife, they're not
The leaders of the estate, they're not there
They're asleep, so okay, good
So
What does he find her doing?
Lucian finds her, Polystra's sitting there
And she's prepping for
Some kind of little
Edible, right?
Some kind of treat
Some kind of dinner
And she's like
If you could only tell him
You could have warned him
You could have warned him
He's gonna end up a piggy pig, isn't he?
He is, he is
Shh, don't tell anyone
Don't tell anyone, blow it up
No, did you bring
Piggy Pig? I don't know
So, what is
She's preparing him this nice
Heavenly banquet, you know what I mean?
And he can't help it
He sees her and he says, oh god
Beautiful, Polystra
The way that
You shake your bottom
And your little pot, it's
Gorgeous
The person
That gets baptized
In you
That is the most
Blessed person
Macarius
Yeah
That's a little bit of spin there
On the end of it, right?
So, is the horror building up?
Do you feel the queasiness?
Your eyes, right?
They're open, I'll keep dropping
I'll keep dropping it in the serum
You need the serum, bro
We need to moisten those eyes
Can you moisten their eyes? Did you have an image?
To moisten the eyes tonight?
Chewie, give us any kind of image
You've made sense, yes
Glorious
We're going to look into her eyes now
Using the language
That Jesus is using
We're going to draw Jesus
Out of this text
We're going to draw him out
By using his language
I'm going to show you
What real Christing is
Within
The right
That's prevalent in the first century
Fantastic
Give it to me, give it to me
We've located the place and everything
Okay, so
Lucian comes up to
His girl, his young girl
And what is she doing?
She's making the meal
And it's time to move
Beyond the meal
Lucian's looking for finding magic
And what does he find?
He finds that she
Has a very much insatiable
Appetite
And she's full
Of charm
Right?
And who is she? She's a Corracion
Who is this girl?
A Corracion, can you show me
What a Corracion is?
A little girl
A maiden
A maiden, are you kidding me?
Is this from, what time
Period is this? Do we always
It's disturbance, I think we go
Through the Victorians
Right? Does anybody smell it?
Smells a bit stale
Yeah, I love it, okay
Let's keep going
Let's keep going, don't slow down
Don't slow down, we've got to make it
In time, we've got to make it
Oh, I'm sorry, go back to that
There we go, so she's a Corracion
Right? And literally
That's a diminutive from
Corois
Which is the Mycenaean
So now you've stepped into the Bronze Age
This is where this mystery
Cult that has a Christ is coming from
Fantastic, and what does she say
Now there's two conditional sentences
Here for the Greeklings
Two conditional sentences
The first is a future less vivid
Followed by a future
Future more vivid
Oh my god
Gorgeous, now watch the first one
Here, right? She's all ready to go
What does she say to him?
She says, look, you would
Run away
Oh boy
If you had a mind
And a desire
To live
But I
This
This is full
Of fire
And
Steam
This is full
She's pointing to herself
This is full of fire and steam
And if you touch it once
What is she talking about
Touching? She's talking about
What she just mentioned
The pot
Notice I didn't translate that
The pot, if you touch this pot
Once
You will burn
That's what she says
She says you will burn
How are you going to be helped
Once you've been burned
By coming back
And taking the painful burn
Again
You know what she says
Give me the next one
She goes on
Did you think you were coming to a horror movie?
I think it's coming
We went to a horror movie
How do we get there?
Give me the next one
You're right
By the way, where do we see the
Where have we seen this girl before?
Remember
A dude who had all the money
Came to Jesus and he was like
Dude
He has position and power
I'm assuming the money was there too
But he comes to him and he's like
Dude, I've got a curation
And she's all passed out
Sounds like Eyes Wide Shut
Doesn't it?
I've got a curation
And she's all passed out
It's one of these little girls
And he saves her life
He says she's not dead
He brings her
Wakes her up
Because he knows what he's doing
He's the one who uses the drugs
That induce death and he told you
He told you evangelicals
He told you that
I'll give you drugs that induce death
And it won't harm you
Was nobody listening
When
He was doing the cult thing
At what point did you not understand
That Christing is a drug operation
That makes you
Horny
Did you know that? Yeah, it does
Makes you horny, that's what he says
Okay, let's get into it
Let's see what they're doing
What kind of aphrodisiac are these
Knuckleheads using
In Christianity with Jesus
Oh my god
Give me the next one
Give me the next
Which one?
We're going to talk about
Touching and
Disciples here, apostles
The apostles are telling you
Remember somebody's bringing Jesus children
You've got to realize that
In order that he can hop to them
And I'm going to show you
Somebody hop toing
Right?
You can hop to my in the middle for yourself
And that is what
We are doing
In the text
Yeah
To the Corracion
Alright
Okay
There it is
Now you understand
When they come to Jesus and they're like
Okay, we've got a Corracion
That went down, right? You've got to come
You've got to see what's going on, man
You know what I mean? Now you understand
Okay
Fantastic
Give me the next one
What happens now?
Yeah, so she says
She's going on with her speech
This is the Corracion
Now we're giving voice to the Corracion
Tell us
What's going on?
Her name means
The place where you wrestle
What does she say?
She says, look
I alone
You like this
And paradoxically
I
And the one
Who will make you
To be in that state
To be capacitated
And the only therapy
You're going to get
Is going to be me
Even if somebody
Is chasing you with rocks
That's what I thought
That's kind of unique
Trying to throw rocks at you
Get out of here, kid
Doesn't matter
Alright
It's because you want
My sweet
Sweet pain
You want the antidote
You want the antidote
To the mystery
You want to get to that point
You want that
Orgy
In the classical sense
Of an eye-opening cult
That
Gives you eternal life
Through a
Savior
And by eternal I mean Ionic
Through a
Savior
That's what you were looking for
In Lucian's
Ass
Are you ready?
You'll understand what I just said
As I show it to you now
Give me the next one
Isn't this classical literature fantastic?
Now do you know
Why Julian said
Don't let the Christians teach it
They'll warp it
They'll twist it and warp it
And turn it into
Godabaj, right?
And all the art will get skinny
People who are depressed
Your society will be depressed
This is just Lucian saying
Hey, you're right about that
From a distance
I saw you coming from a distance
And boy was I
You didn't just burn me
You turned me into a flaming inferno
And what'd you do
You put that invisible fire
Which I thought was a neat way to describe
Some kind of
Magical
Process
You put some invisible fire
Somebody said to me
If I put an invisible fire into your eyeballs
That's what he says that she's doing
She's filling them up
Especially in those little private
Naughty places
Remember
Do we have to go back
To the thing with Jesus
And Mary Magdalene
Where he's feeding her
His
Seed
After he has entered
Into self-pleasuring
As the text tells us
Do we have to go back to that place
We don't have to go back to that place
We just went there
And just recall it to mind
Look, if you don't eat it
We're gonna die
Who thought
Who thought it was a good idea
This dude comes out
This dude comes out and runs
Takes this woman out into the back
That later she was pardoned
Hundreds of years later she was pardoned
For possessing sex drugs
Right?
He's gonna
Take her up onto a hill
What does he do? He starts
Pleasuring himself
Why are there no paintings of Jesus Christ
Pleasuring himself
Because there are stories about it
There are stories from antiquity
About it
Is that what the canon was all about?
I wanna know the theology
Of Jesus Christ
Pleasuring himself
And then eating it
I wanna know the psychology
Of that too because it's a little
Unpleasant
Did you think you would see that?
I told you guys we're going
To an ancient
Right, a mystery
Right, okay let's watch
Christ each other
I don't know if they're ready for this
Bags on, give me the next one
And
What happens she says
You should remember young guy
Right
You can't really
Reach manhood like you're reaching
Without demonstrating your skill
And wrestling
What do we have here?
Is anybody
Disturbed
Is anybody
Disturbed
There's a little disturbance there
Why is that?
Because you're getting used to the picture
That is the original mystery
I've got a word
For all the monks out there
You give me the next one
I've got a word for all the monks out there
It's not
But it might as well be
Keep it there
Who is he by the way
She describes him as
At least he
You know he is one of those
Thebes
That would attract
The lady of magic
Who we know we're using
There's sex drugs all the time
Right sex drugs all over the place
And who are they
Who are they gravitating towards
They're gravitating towards
The aphib
The one who has arrived
At puberty
So this is who Lucius is
Finally we see a description
Who is he? He's an aphib
And people who are Christing
Are doing it
For the sake of access
To the aphibs
Yeah
Well then you say what about Jesus Christ
He's got all of his aphib students
Right? With him
That he's taken from
Right off their parents' ships
Right?
So they could go fish for men
Right?
He's taken them right off of that
Right out of that life
Put them right into that
Lastic right
Where the boys are being drugged
Right?
All of this is being made possible through Christing
Because Christing makes
You
Psychotically
Horny
Disturbingly horny
Right?
Ever aroused
Ever aroused
Do you see what it brings out
You know what you can bring out of people
You can bring demons out of them
Yeah
Jesus Christ did it
With Mary
Seven times
He was saying it
It was impressive
Why do you think we go there
Stop
You're going to scandalize me
When I read you the priest's words
By the way
We'll get there
Actually let's show it up now
Where's the ass
I'm looking for the pick of the ass
There's one
Right?
You'll notice the head
Of Jesus Christ
Is the head of an ass
And you'll wonder to yourself
What is going on
I'll tell you what's going on
Artificial intelligence
Is reaching into the void
And pulling out from it
This
Because this is the image
That we first see
Of Jesus Christ
Look at what he's doing
He's worshiping
And there's Jesus
On the cross
It's not a very sophisticated cross
But remember this is graffiti
And rock
What the hell is it
It's scratched in there
Son of a
Look at the last letter
The first scratch
He didn't mean to do that
And what is his head
What is his head
Is that on plaster
Look what is his head
It's stone
It's the head of an ass
The head of an ass
Why does Jesus have the head
Of the ass
I'm going to tell you the answer
To that question
Which has never been answered before
I'm going to quote it to you
From
The first century
Very popular
Very popular
Ass
Story
Yes
Written by priests
Love it
Is this the next one
Look people
Just so you don't think
That this is
The most
That it's my creation
When I keep telling everybody
The sex and the drugs
Are all part of the mystery
Is Christing yourself with a sex drug
So you can be around boys
Okay
Canitis
You can do the canitis thing
Jesus Christ
Fine
Just so you know it's just not me
I want you to look
At the wonderful description
They gave in this reader
Which is gorgeous
For all my students have been through
The intensive course
Just swamp this reader
Just swamp this website
We're going to list that website and everything
We'll do it later
The love-making scene of Lucius
And Pleistria is filled with
Devlon Tondra
Involving military and wrestling
Metaphors
The greeks describe
Or the greek language
Loves to describe sexuality
In the most vivid of terms
The most vivid of terms
What Lucian does
Pleistria
Offers herself as the wrestler
And they're going to wrestle
And she tells him exactly
How she wants him to wrestle
And he wrestles
And why does he wrestle?
Because he really wants her
To use the magic
He wants her to use the magic
He wants her to use the drugs
Right?
And he thinks he's going to get there
He thinks he's going to get there
This way, it's like a sacred path
That he's on
It's like a sacred path
A mystery purification
Now, if you're
Surprised that Jesus Christ
Was performing mystery purifications
On a Phoebes
I'm sorry
But the history
Is wrapped up in the language
Braun, it's easy to get it
There's no theologian, I guarantee you
There's no theologian alive
Who has ever read
Lucian's ass
To every theologian out there
That gets my goat
Do we have Penelope anywhere?
That gets my goat
It really, really gets my goat
The cross
Must cover the sins
Of Penelope
Do you understand?
Jesus Christ
Was in it
Using drugs
To interact
Sexually with the Phoebes
Right?
Okay
Give me the next one
Let's look at more, let's go deeper into the ass
Okay
Are you ready?
Here we go
Here we go, oh do you know what's happening here?
Okay, so look
She just tells him, you gotta prove yourself
As a wrestler, you punk
Okay
So, she strips down
She strips down naked
Standing totally naked in front of him
Right? And she sets things up
She gets herself
Ready
In front of him
And she says, hey
Merakion
Do we have the next slide, I think is what
Merakion
I cannot bring that one
Oh, here it is
A boy, a lad, a stripling
He is going to be stripping
But
Stripling, okay
We'll say it, the stripling
Merakion
So that's how she addresses him
Right? It's, you know, clever
Give me the next one
Hey
Merakion
Take off your clothes
And oil up your part
With the Mer
Uh-huh
And you're going to do this so that you can embrace
Your antagonist
So you can embrace your antagonist
You know what that is? That's wrestling
You get oiled up when you wrestle
Then
After those two have wrestled
You take that and you scrape it off of them
And you can use that as a drug
Yeah, that's what they do
That's how advanced
This scientific knowledge is
Look at it
I know it's alien, but look at it
Oh, my God
Are you ready?
Okay, now here's the
Everybody, this is going to be
As scientific
As I can possibly make it
And I'm just going to
Paraphrase
She says, I want you to put me
On my back on the bed
And I want you to grab my legs
And I want you to spread them
And I want you to rip me apart
Okay
Okay
That
Is the translation
That
Is what you have in the company
Of
The
Stripling
Who is being
Inducted
By the magic rite
Of Christ
Okay
And what does she say
Oh, my God
Let's go to the next one
There's some other stuff there
Some details, but it's quite
It's quite explicit
And I want to be as scientifically
I want to remain
As pure as we possibly can
Right
And so what does she say
He starts talking
During the wrestling
And what does she say
She slaps him in the face
Right
And she says
What kind of wordy
Student
Apostle have I taken
What kind of wordy
Apostle do I now have
Right, she slaps him in the face
Right
Why
Why
Why
Is that part and parcel
Wait, the drugs are coming
Give me the next one
There's just a few things I want you to see
Oh, God
So look what he says
We finished
We had all of this
Heednism
We had all of this child's play
And I know
When I say that
I understand it causes
Just a tiny bit of nausea
A tiny bit of nausea
But you need to see what the Christ is doing
You need to see what's going on
He says
They totally crowned themselves
It's a bit colloquial
We totally crowned ourselves
In this night agony
This night struggle
This night wrestling
And there was a lot of truffe going on
Right
There was a lot of just pleasantness
Right
So much of it that I forgot
That I was supposed to be going
To Larissa
Right, and then I come here
Right, because I wanted to learn
I wanted to learn
What did he want to learn
So he turns to here
He says, hey
Baby
Hey, baby, show me
The magic woman
Right, show me the woman
Who changes her form
Show me that queen
Right, okay
He wants her
To show him the magic
And wait, blow it up
What does she say to him?
He further says, you know
This is something he's had on his mind for a long time
He's had this image in her head
In his head, excuse me
And he wants to fulfill this
He wants that magic
He wants that magic
To come out of her
He wants her to have the source
And she tells him, hey bro
Right
You've got the wrong person
Right, you've got the wrong person
He says
This is inserted
This is in the wrong area
Here he's saying, actually give me the next one
We're supposed to have the next one
He's talking about the women talking about him
He further says, you know
You've got some great power going on baby
Because
Ladies know that I'm a virgin
Right, ladies know it
And they'll look at me and I'll avoid it
But you
I couldn't turn away from
Right, I couldn't turn away from that vision
Right, so he's like
If you have this gift
I want to know what it is to fly
Right
They think I'm
Ataman teen
Right, I want to know what it is
To fly, give me wings
And what does she say
What does she say the next
Oh god
Oh, look at the last word here
Psuha go guza
Right, Psuha go guza
What is she doing
She is a soul
Chaser
Soul conveyor
And what is she doing
She's taking him
Into captivity
With her erotic warfare
Her erotic warfare
Okay, now if you're looking
An Amazonian in the face
This makes great great sense
And there are Amazonian marks
All over this
Right, who
Do you know a 12 year old
That's so forcefully
I mean she's smack smacking him around
She's drugging him
What is she
Right, and he's like
Look, I want to see the transformation
I want to see the change
Are you ready for the change
Give me the next one
Are you ready for the change
She knows nothing of magic
And promises to arrange
A meeting between Lucius and her mistress
Right, so Plystra, what does she say
She says cut it out
Right, we're going to stop playing here
Right
What's this thing
Who's able to walk this path
To do the magic
On Eros
Right, he's the lord
Of the art
You cannot
Overcome
Eros with the magic
It's his bow
It's his bow
Do you understand
If you haven't figured out Lady Babylon
If you haven't figured out yet
I'm going to pull you forward
Because a lot of people have figured this out already
Eros is the devil
Eros is the devil
Eros is the dawn bringer
Yes
Isn't that beautiful
And so Plystra says
Look, calm down
Calm down, you can't have that power
Right, what does she say
What does she say
I don't know
The magic
I cannot
Right
I don't learn my writing
Why is that
Because the magic
Comes through
Those spells
The magic comes through
The prescriptions
She hasn't gotten
To that level yet
She doesn't learn any art
And she says not only that
But the lady of the house
The one who can do it
She's totally jealous
She's totally jealous of the skill
And she keeps it guarded
She doesn't let other people
Know about it
She just practices herself
She just practices herself
Right
So they go to look
They go to look at her
To see what she's doing
They, I'm not describing this
From this passage, I was reading ahead
What are they doing
They're going to watch the lady of the house
Then actually perform magic
And of course what does it start with
It starts with her
Christing herself
Christing herself
And she's doing it by taking these boxes
She's got a chest full
Of drug boxes
Boxes
Boxes
Boxes
She takes it out
And she takes this
Ointment
And an alabaster
And she cries herself
She cries herself
Down she wished
She could have seen that
Lucian did
Lucian did, he saw the whole thing
Through a little crack
He saw the whole thing
He somehow got the picture
And what did he do
He asked
Because she turns into
A feathered
Night raven
Isn't that gorgeous
A feathered night raven
And she flies off
Here's some of the stuff that's going on
I want you to see the actual right
Look at the first line
She's naked and she goes
With these lamps
And it's the same word that they're using
In Revelation
For the lamps
What do you do with these lamps
She takes two
Measures
She takes two of these
Measures
Of frankincense
And
She puts it
On the lamp
And standing there
She talks
Over the lamp
She says many things
And then she opens up her chest
She takes out one of these boxes
Right
And she uses one of these drugs
Give me the next one
What is she doing with the drug
What is she doing
She creatives it
She crisis it
She is
A
She is a Christ
Remember this is contemporary
This is the contemporary usage
Of Christing at the same time
That the gospels are being recorded
She Christ herself
Why did you do it they ask the witch
Because my husband couldn't take me
To the places that the devil could
My husband couldn't take me
To the places that the devil could
My husband couldn't take me
To the places that the devil could
And let me tell you something
Those of you who are out there
Whose husbands can't take you
To that place
In your dreams
In your dreams
I love it
I love it
Can you feel that
Can you feel that ancient
Worship of Aphrodite
Can you feel that
It's got a buzz to it
Bacchic buzz to it
Give me the next one
Here we go, it's after the Christ thing
After the Christ thing
What else did I bring
I just wanted you to see
She's that night raven
That's where she becomes
A night raven
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Too bad we don't see the night raven
Elsewhere
Give me the next one
Look
What's Lucian doing at this point
He can't believe what he's saying
He's like rubbing his eyes
I can't believe my own eyes
Did I see that?
Was I dreaming that?
Right?
Do you know what I need?
Do you know what I need?
I want to be
Look at the second
The second to the bottom
Sixth word in
Chrisasa
That's what he wants to be
Make me a Christ
Make me a Christ
Make me a Christ
With what?
With that pharmacon
That you have at the bottom
Give that to me
I want to try
What it tastes
Do you see the draw
When Jesus walked up to children
He didn't just say
I've got some candy
Over in the corner
He roped them into situations
Where they were drugged
And what does the drug do?
The drug is satarian
And it causes you
To be
Aroused
Now
Inside of this
If I say aroused
You're going to think
Scientifically that's a man
No
It's the female
To be put in a state
That they describe
Openly
As insatiable sexual
Appetite
Sexual appetite
That persists
Sexual appetite
That drives
Psychotically
This is the oistress
This is the oistress
We get estrus from it
With cows
You ever seen a cow and that's
Right
They're into it
And
That's what we're doing
With the drug in the right
In the first
And second century
Anodomony
Isn't that amazing?
Isn't that amazing?
Cover it up
Please, good job Chewie
That sin almost got through there
I'm glad you covered it up
Praise Jesus
Put a cross on it buddy
Give me the next one
What else is going on in the ass?
He says I want to be that bird
Let me just explain what happens
Quickly
He has polyester
Lucius has polyester go in
And get the drug
Only she gets the wrong one
And he turns into
An ass
He turns into an ass
He turns into an ass
And what do you think happens to him as an ass?
When he goes through a lot of adventures
But the one that really
Sticks out
The one that you really need
To see
For the sake of its ritual
Is the one
Where he ends up
With his
Donkey parts
Satisfying
The
Oystress
Of the woman
Who initiates him
Satisfying the
Oystress
Look at how it's aimed
Look at how the right is aimed
If you thought
Christianity did not involve drugs
You don't know what a Christ is
If you thought that Christianity
Didn't involve sex
You don't know what a Christ is
I am here
To travel
To bring you
Your religion
I'm showing it to you
And don't worry
Moses looks straight into God's
What?
Ass
Yeah
Yeah
It's had a lot of power hasn't it
It's a spark for monism
Bruh
It's a spark
For monism
Which by the way is coming for
Everyone
Yes
No the devil was laughing about that
He was like somebody wrote to me
And said I want to know
About the vice president
Becoming a candidate
And the devil thought
That was hilarious because
Look I told you we're here
To stop tyrants
In tyranny
Tyrants do not
Respect
Elections
It doesn't matter
What are you magically thinking
What are you magically thinking
Are you thinking that
She'll take over and
They'll all go away
Now
The plague of the tyrant
Lasts
Until the very end
Of the tyrant
Sick
Simper
Tyrannus
That's why the Romans ran off the last king
And they said never again
There's something
The Greeks and some of you are
Beginning to understand this
There's something in Greek society
Where the worst thing you can do
As a human being
Is
Your knee
To a human
You're that kind of person
You're that kind of person that loves tyranny
You're willing to bend the knee
You know what the Athenians used to say about that
They used to give the Spartans a hard time
You treat those
You treat those bastards like they're kings
That's your problem
You don't have a democratia
What's wrong with you people
You don't even have any plays
Right why
Because some people
Love tyranny
Not you and I from Athens
Not you and I from Athens
No
We follow the oracles people
We follow the system set up
By the Athena
Right she who is immortal
She is worth
Bowing to
Yeah
Not a person
Congratulations
You have your yahoo
Orange yahoo
Son of yahoo
God
It's beautiful
So don't think I can't say anything about
Vice president
I've got no I don't know
I haven't studied anything about her
I don't know anything about her
But I'm not interested
There will only be a show
The tyrants don't accept elections
Even if she wins
Right do you think it's just gonna
Tyrants just what's
Do tyrants go away to Hitler
Retire to Florida
No
Once you start down the path of tyrant
You will end
With the violence
That you have fraught upon everyone else
It's a natural cycle
It's a classical
Cycle
Yeah
That is what we garden the museum
We don't care about
You know the politics and the situation
We're here for the
To watch the tyranny
Love it love it
Fantastic
Like it's gonna matter the devil's
He's laughed at that for a long time
You morons really think it's gonna matter
Have you read nobody
Have you
Totally ignored your ancestors
What are you doing
America
What are you doing
Mmm
Mmm gonna become
A connitus aren't you
All you maggots
Bunch of conniti
Where
Is he bring him out
Where is that connitus
Bring that connitus
What's going on in the snacks
I want you to see
Look people
Lacedy
I told you
Remember Jesus said I'm not
Lacedace
Here's an example of what a lacedy do
These were coming
Back from an expedition
Around midnight
And they didn't have any
Gold or silver
They didn't have anything prepared except
For one little
Arthenas and she was
Orion
Orion
Yes
What does that mean
Just having come into season
Like a ripe fruit
For the picking that's how they looked
That's how they looked at the development
Of the human body they looked at it in agricultural
Terms look at her
She's a fruit
Right
What are they going to do to her
They're going to pick the fruit
She's sitting there crying
Tearing out her hair
Mommy
Why is she crying for her mommy
Why is she crying for her mommy
Because these
Lacedy
These people that Jesus was
Hung between
Which kind of makes you think
If they put him up between two lacedy
He's probably one and that's probably
Denying it saying I'm not one
These creeps have gone out
And they've abducted a kid
And they're going to do things
To her
To turn her into a
Passive slave
A sex slave
Yeah
That's what you've got
That's the history of the people
Who are involved in the Christ
Thing and the magic
Yeah
You will drink death inducer
Says Jesus and it won't hurt you
Really
I guess I want to go there
Now you're really confused
Give me the next one
It was a good thing
Look what's going on
Here's the Jesus saying
Look Jesus said to the crowd
How'd you come out here
How'd you come out here with your swords
And your clubs coming at me
Like I'm a lacedace
Yeah
When Jesus got arrested
I want you to realize
They sent a SWAT unit
After him
They were not kidding
Why? Because the same dudes
That will kidnap a girl
A minor
And the same dudes
That will drug boys
As apostles
And strip himself naked
And wash their feet while he's naked
That same dude
Is connected
With weaponry
Yeah, so you got to go out with the SWAT team
Right? They know
The warrant was out for Jesus
And they were like here
This kid that he's been drugging and molesting
This kid will show you
Right?
This kid will show you
Give him a big kiss
Here he is
You know what the kiss of betrayal was
For Jesus? It wasn't for an innocent dude
It was for a dude that drugged
Children
And the punishment that you have
Is being a servant
Of Christianity
I don't care if you believe it or not
Devil says
You're all slaves
Ha
Ding dong
Who's at the door
Who's at the door
Reality is at the door
This is gorgeous, isn't it?
What's going on? Jesus says
He's in the garden
It's all painful
It's all painful to the point of death
It's when he's using
You didn't realize it
But Jesus is using his death inducer
He is Christing himself
In an attempt
To stay alive through the process
And his buddies are so
His children are so drugged
They can't wake up
They keep falling asleep while he's doing it
Damn
And he's doing it with that naked kid
That he was arrested with
The reason he raised
He raised up his hands and said
I'm not one of these sex traffickers
Is because
Those people end up getting crucified
They don't care about murderers
You don't crucify thieves
You crucify
People
Who abducts
Drug
And commit heinous acts upon children
That's who you crucify
And your justice is knowing
That Jesus Christ
Is one of these
I'm sure
There are many of you out there
Who want to say
There's no way that Jesus Christ
Was such a person
Not my Jesus Christ
Okay
Then deny
That he was arrested with a naked kid
In a public park
And the kid was bandaged on his privates
Epigumnu is on
His private parts
Bandaged
The thing fell off when he took off
Do you know what Jesus was sucking
Through that bandage
Now
Galenae
If you're not in the cult
Through these words
Because everybody in Satanic congregation
Has been here
We have seen this cult in practice
We have seen it
In the words
Of the dead
Isn't that great
The whole job here was to find
Those ghosts
That's the whole job
What do you think Satan is in charge of the underworld for
What do you think his power is
It's over those voices
Isn't that gorgeous
And you're hearing it
We just sucked it out of Lucius's ass
Go
Give me the next one
What happens
Look he says
I want you to swear by the living God
Are you the Christos
Do you know what your brilliant theologians
Have done with this
Because this is what Jesus is on trial for
They know he's a laystace
And they're saying just tell us
Are you a Christos
Are you a Christos
And somebody's going to say
There's a definite article there
No there's a generic
Definite article
If you haven't read more than 50 lines
Of biblical Greek
You're not going to know that
But there is
And he's saying are you
One of these Christs
The sons of God
Is that what you're doing
Right
Give me the next one
Chewie
You didn't fall asleep
How does the Christ end up
How does the Christ end up
Jesus remained silent
The high priest said
I charge you under the oath by the living God
Tell us if you are the Messiah
The son of God
Now
We are now in a back alley
And you
Are being touched
You're being touched by rabbis
From the first, second, third centuries
And you know what they're doing
You know what they're doing
They're grafting on
Their own tradition
In order
To acquire texts
That are originally Greek
To put their own stamp on it
They're back transiting
Their jars
With all their Greek sources
That they're translating
Miserably into
Hebrew, ancient Hebrew
Which only has seven to eight thousand
Work capacity
And what are they jamming
Messiah
Did you know it's not in the Greek text
That is an original Greek text
Of the New Testament
And do you know it's Christ
It is not Messiah
That is a lie
It is a lie
And historical
Chunk of propaganda
Stuck in the time stream
Causing a
Slant
Causing a projection
Another timeline to form
Where we all believe
What was planted
Julian
Said don't let it happen man
Not to maintain
Those classical sources
So you know
By the way
This story of Lucian tonight
Is brought to you by an earlier story
Of the ass
That everybody is following
And why is everybody so interested
In this ass
Why the ass is transformed
And eventually
Eating
The roses
The great one
You see on the beach
When that full moon is out
That face
Her power
Overcomes him and he eats a rose
And what happens
He sheds his asinine form
He sheds his asinine form
But before we get there
He's going to have to encounter
The people here
In the way who are training
The boys
The people who are Christing
He's going to have to deal
With them directly and in the form
Of a donkey he's brought
To these apostles
What I am telling you
Is so popular
Because in the first century
A great riddle
Was making its way
It was a riddle
From
A Hellenistic
Priest of Apollo
And in it
He talked about the ass
That bore the gift
That through the serpent
Became your
Thirst
Hail Satan
Hail Satan, that's fantastic
Can you see it there
Give me a couple more, we'll just finish up
He invokes nemesis
I just wanted you to see
He invokes nemesis and why is he invoked nemesis
Because there are
People, there's this old dude
He's got all of these kids
His Mothetai, his apostles
And what's he doing
Is leading them around in the way
Of the Syrian
Mother
God
Look at that
The Syrian mother god
He's bringing them
To these bankwits
What are they, they're Canidoids
They're the Canidists
Who's in company
With other apostles
And what do they learn
They learn to give
Their backsides
Yes
There's a little dance
To do the dance
If you're not doing the dance
It's because you're not in the mystery
Don't worry about it
You're not in the mystery
Give me the next one
Boom
We've only got a couple more
And then I'm going to hit you with something
So
They come up to this house
Of filibus
And what happens
The old pervert
Says
He's got his crowd of boys
And he looks in the door
And he yells at him
He says
Why is he calling all these teenage boys
Young girls
Why is he calling them ladies
Right
What
He says he's got something for them
Something real good
And what is he bringing
To his Canidon
There you see it
What is he bringing them
That donkey
He's bringing them
Remember
The centaurs that we talked about
These are men
Who are part horse
Okay
Got a mental picture
Men who are part horse
If you didn't
Read the Bible
You didn't see in the book of Ezekiel
That we've got two
Coracia
Girls who were there
And what are they doing
They're looking at the pictures of the Egyptian men
And what do they do
They go down to Egypt
Why do they go down to Egypt
Because they want to partake in the mystery
They want to be involved
In the mystery
This is Ezekiel
Dirty, dirty, dirty prophet
Talking about dirty, dirty mystery
Okay
Give me the next one
Does it bother you that the Bible is so graphic
You should
They want us all to start learning the Bible
Here in the States
We're going to start learning the Bible
Here's more
Ask for you
Are you ready? A foreign lady
Pays to be able to sleep with Lucius
Now this woman comes out of nowhere
And I say woman
Hesitantly
Hesitantly because she's really not a woman
And we'll see that in a minute
What does she do?
She says look she's got a lot of money
I'll just, she says she's got a lot of money
You know what I mean
And she's burning man
What does she do? She sees that ass
And she says oh my god
Can I rent
Your ass for one night
And the guy's like sure
Sure you can
So she ends up
With the ass
In a Christing situation
Where he
Confesses
Where the ass confesses
Where he confesses
What does he confess?
Oh god
Where is it? Look at the very bottom line
Look at the very bottom line
He confesses that the chrismati
To muro
So the chrism
Of the myrrh
Has done what to him
It's in the next
What is it done?
Oh there it is
Right
It's put him into a position
It's put him into a position
And he's describing, oh this is a later description
I know what I did, I took this from later
But he first describes
What the chrism does
And it does for him
It puts him into a place that he sees
He sees
That woman
Slash
He sees her
As an agent
That attracts him
He sees her
As beautiful
And how does he do that? He does that by means
Of the chrism
By means of the Christing
Do you want to see that? Remember
When you go to a temple
And the temple priestess
In this healing temple
Is bringing you to the place of climax
Under the influence of drugs
Right?
I'm not talking just men
Because the women are doing it in groups
Okay
So when you come
To the pinnacle of that
Biological act
Under the influence of their drugs
The point is to bring
You healing
To bring you healing
And when you see that priestess
In the eyes of the drugs
She becomes that beauty
That absolute divine beauty
Isn't that interesting?
They're using sexuality
And drugs within
Christian right
Right? This is where Jesus is coming
From
Okay
Now you know what a Christ is
Right? I think that was...
Give me that last one again
Oh
Yeah
So what does he do? He turns
On asinine
He eats the rose, turns back into human
He's got to explain to people
He says this lady's servant
What does she do?
She gave me this Christing
This magical Christing
Oh, seriously?
Yeah
And he goes on to blame her
He goes on to blame her for having
Information in him
Right?
Then you know, happy ending
He's lost his shell
Well, I want to tell you
Why that was so prominent
A theme
This very, very popular author
Talked about that
And when you look into
The transference of youth
Here's the thinking
Okay, so now you've got
To get back on the ship, we're going to go back
We're going to go back to our time
And space
And when it gets down to it then
When you're looking at that
Right? You have to ask yourself
What is happening?
What is happening in the people
That are participating? Both
The child that is
Being indoctrinated, drugged
And you know, I forgot
To tell you about these kids, these canidois
These disciples
What do they do?
They cut off their testicles
Right? They cut off their testicles
You know, there's not a
There's not a lot going on
Down there
Right?
There's not a lot of testicular development
So you are creating
For the sake of the mystery
Your disciples have to be
That proper
That proper vessel
That proper vessel, right?
With Mary up in the mountain
And he's like, look, you got to eat this
And Jenny masturbates
Right in front of her, right?
That kind of
Approach is the same
Root that you see, it's the same approach
You see on
The side of
This asinine
Cult, right?
It's the same root you see in it
She, polystra, right?
Is affecting
That real
Very real magic
He only has to be transformed
To learn
To get to the point that he's born again
Right?
This is the mystery religion
Of the first
And it's coming to us
Through an
Apollo's
Priest
Within the written
Word
Through mother greek
Thank you
For coming tonight
Thank you for coming
I guess here's what we'll do
I want chewy to play the exit
But I'm not leaving
I'm leaving, I'm going to go get the drill instructor
For those of you who are working
Steadily through
We're going to look at some things from unit 3
So go ahead and hit the outro
Please
I'm
Flipping tables
Taking to the bank
At the gates of Avalon
The wolf man regulates
Avalon, Avalon
Lady Medea
Lapis lazuli lines the walls
The news sings with me
Extra illumination
For the vibration
I have under me
The knowledge of our genesis
Crystal towers
The Punisher Frank Castle
Purple rain
For the news I sing a favorite song
All night long
No stems, no seeds
That you don't need
Got a bag of goodies
Ice creamy cream
Hail Satan
Close minds forever
Coming through in waves
Tower house on the hill
House of Frankenstein
Darkness to dreams
Our dream of Jeanie
High purple
Medea should work you
High purple
High purple
High purple
Medea should work you
High purple
High purple
High purple
High purple
Medea should work you
High purple
High purple, high purple, look at you, she'll work you.
High purple, high purple, high purple, baby.
All right, you've come here.
If you're watching, I'm in black.
You've come here because you've been working through units one and units two.
And the folks from your laboratory have contacted me and I thank everything.
Everything was coming along swimmingly, at least from what I saw.
I got to go back and go over that.
But I want you to know people are working hard, Nancy's working hard.
All boys working hard and making videos for you to be walking yourself through the process.
We've gone through and I can't forget fish and whoever else is currently involved with TA.
Excuse me, we'll promote you actively later.
You're doing a fantastic job and keep it up.
Keep it up, fantastic.
Give me the first thing that we're going to have to look at.
You people have been motoring through one and two, units one and two.
And you have seen that unit two was about verbs.
Unit three is the second half of your verb section.
And we have learned some tenses in our verbs.
We've learned the present.
We've learned the imperfect.
We've learned the future.
We've learned the heiress.
Those are all tenses.
Now we're going to learn the perfect and the pluperfect.
The last two tenses that we're going to look at.
And then we're going to look at using a different mood.
This is all indicative that you've learned so far.
It's all indicative.
What is indicative?
It is just a simple declaration.
I go to the store.
I will go to the store.
I went to the store.
Simple declaration.
What are the subjunctive and the obstative moods do?
That's what we're going to start working with.
So I've got to teach you the obstative and subjunctive morphology.
I want you to see the morphology.
And we're only going to be talking about two tenses with the obstative and subjunctive.
Excuse me.
We're going to be talking about the present and the heiress.
Why is that?
Because when you switch out of the indicative mood, the verb just hear it.
The verb loses its sense of time and gains a very strong aspect.
And what is the aspect?
It's whether or not the verb is being done habitually, whether or not it's a simple event,
whether or not it's an ongoing act, or whether the perfect aspect is an act that has already been done.
That is, you are in a state.
The perfect tense is you are in a state of having done something.
That doesn't sound like a past tense to me.
It doesn't.
It doesn't sound like I did or was doing.
It sounds like I have come to a place where I am done.
And that's exactly what the perfect is.
It's from its aspect.
The verbs have aspect to them.
Great.
Fantastic.
This is the morphology you need to learn from Unit 3.
Here are the endings of the perfect.
And you say, wait a minute.
It's just like the, it's just like the heiress, except for the third person plural.
Instead of on is assi.
Isn't that nice?
And look, there's a new movable after in the third person singular and the third person plural.
There's a new movable there.
Good.
You can tack that on the end when you got a vowel that follows it in the next word.
Good.
Here are the examples of I have educated.
You have educated.
He she it as educated, et cetera, et cetera.
Pe pi del cop.
People.
This tense, the perfect is formed from the fourth principle part.
The fourth principle part.
Okay.
So all you do is remove the ending of the fourth principle part.
Right.
You're going to take off that alpha and you got your stem and you just add all of these
endings to it.
I'm an assi.
Good.
Give me the next one, which is the plume perfect.
Plume perfect.
Here we go.
And what is the plume perfect?
Well, you just take a perfect.
I have done it.
Right.
Pe pi del cop.
Right.
You just take that and you add an epsilon augment on the front of it to change it from I have
taught to I had taught.
I had taught.
It's completed in the past.
So you got a past augment on the fog in the front of the verb and you've got that ending
now.
And here's your endings.
Look at the morphology.
A, A, A, M, and S son.
A, A, M, and S son.
Those are your plume perfects.
Right.
I had taught.
Good.
Good.
Now let's move on.
Those are the two tenses you've got to learn in unit three.
And then we've got a couple of other things.
Here is your subjunctive ending.
Now I'm only going to give you two tenses, the present and the heiress.
And here are the present and the heiress endings for the subjunctive.
They're the same in both tenses.
The only difference is you use the first principle.
Part for the present and use the third principle part for the heiress.
And that's how you'll be able to tell.
And that's why I tell people we've got to memorize all our principle parts from the
chapter.
Right.
Lulo, luso, elusa.
Leluca, lelumae, eluthane.
At least remember that one.
That one.
Good.
If we're in class together and there's nine of you, I can call on you.
I can say, what are the, you know, identify this verb?
Is it first person's anger?
What is it?
Right.
You can, you can say what it is.
We can drill each other.
Right.
So here's the present subjunctive.
Do the next one.
And I also brought along, and remember the heiress is going to be the same.
It's going to be the same ending.
So now we go to the obstative, the present obstative and the heiress obstative.
The present obstative is going to have different looking endings.
It's going to have different looking endings from the heiress obstative.
Here are the present.
Oime, oise, oi, oimen, oite, oien.
Oime, oise, oi, oimen, oite, oien.
You should be saying that to yourself.
Oime, oise, oi, oimen, oite, oien.
Isn't that beautiful?
And so you just add that ending to a present stem paideo, and you get paideo on me.
Isn't that nice?
Okay.
Now don't worry about what it means.
I just want you to be able to reproduce the forms.
Oime, oise, oi, oimen, oite, oien.
If I yell at you in a classroom, if I yell at you, what are the present obstative endings?
You'll see.
Oime, oise, oi, oime, oise, oien, oimen, oite, oien.
Give me the next one.
What about the heiress endings?
Well, they're close.
Look, they look a lot like the present obstative, but the heiress obstative,
instead of having the omicron as their preferred vowel,
they've got the alpha.
Just like all the other heiresses have an alpha.
Oime, oise, oi, oimen, oite, oien.
And I want you to notice there's variants for the second person singular,
third person singular, and the third person plural.
There are variants.
Okay.
So you've got to be aware of that.
If you want to memorize one paradigm, memorize all the alphas.
Don't memorize the variants with them, so at least you've got that.
Oime, oise, oi, oimen, oite, oien.
Good.
Now, the next chart is going to just give us some vocabulary,
and I want people to be working when they work on sentences.
I want them to be working on vocabulary, too.
What is an athlon?
What is Allah?
Allah.
What is andi?
What is adide?
Adide.
Oh, don't be so virtuous, right?
Adide.
You have adide.
Ronan, retain their adide, even though they lose their Lord.
Isn't that nice?
It's kind of virtue.
Kind of virtue.
Then you've got a council after that.
Then you've got the verb right.
Look at the principal parts, people, and compare it to luo.
Grafo, grapso, egrapsa, gegrafa, gegra mai, egrafen.
Right now, we've had the first four principal parts.
We'll learn what the fifth and sixth are later when we get into passives.
But for now, all we've got to know are those first four principal parts.
Fantastic.
Deimos.
We've got lots of people there.
Democratia, right?
When somebody asks you, is democracy a Christian word?
You tell them, no.
It's not.
It's a much older Greek pagan word.
You don't have to say pagan.
It's a classical word, right?
Because pagans do funny things.
Modern pagans annoy the hell out of me.
Diop is a preposition, right?
And by the way, you have two pages of notes after these vocabulary pages.
They'll tell you things like, Diop, look, it can mean through.
That's where we get the meaning diameter.
That's where we derive diameter from.
What is diameter?
It's that measurement through the center.
Fantastic.
Oh, love it.
Love it.
It's not the circumference, right?
That's the runs around.
Oh, the stupid Romans.
Anyway, look at the verb at the bottom.
Thuot, thusot, ethusat, tethukah.
Look at that perfect tethukah.
All you got to do is add your ah, ass, eh, amen, ate, assi.
And you can say, I have sacrificed.
You have sacrificed.
He she had sacrificed, et cetera, et cetera.
We, you, they.
Fantastic.
That is what you have to know for that, this much of that unit.
The rest of the unit, we're going to talk about a couple of constructions.
We're going to talk about how to use the optative and the subjunctive.
And I want to ease into that.
I want to give you a little bit of time to catch up on your morphology.
And I want to give you an assignment, please.
This is magic.
Are you ready for the seven people who just left?
They're going to miss it.
Right.
So here's it.
This is a secret.
Are you ready?
I want you to read Euripides bakai.
Together with Lord Byron's wave came together with Oscar Wilde's Salome.
When you do that, you get the whole image.
Thank you for coming tonight.
I want to say that I'm going to go forward with bailing on Java and try to strike out on my own.
I'm going to try to do it.
And if I can, if I can keep the electricity on and keep the pizzas in the oven, I'll be happy.
So if you think you have what it takes to be in a class like that and that you're going to persist and have some, have some gumption.
Right.
Not see how hard it is.
Oh, mommy.
Right.
If you really are out there and that's the kind of student that I want and many of you have written to me.
Right.
So this is your opportunity to do that.
And I appreciate it.
I appreciate it.
So I'm looking forward to some applications and we'll see.
We'll see a next Tuesday.
Now I've got to decide a time and I will let you know on Friday, the time that will work best.
And if you can state in your application, your preferred time on Tuesday or Thursday, make sure you give a zone.
Make sure you give a zone like where you live.
Right.
So that, you know, because we don't all live in the same place.
Yeah.
So I'm looking forward to it.
I'm looking forward to it really.
And I'd like to have, he gives me an opportunity to whip together a platoon that can, they can do special forces type stuff.
I love it.
I love it with Mother Greek.
Okay.
We're going to, we're going to rock everything.
And by the way, I think we've totally destroyed the Perseus tops.
I think we've overloaded it with so much traffic.
I don't think the old thing was capable of handling at all.
Okay.
Which is a great sign.
It's a great sign to everybody involved.
Everybody involved.
What I want you to do for next week is to finish the description that we get of a grammar in unit three.
And I want you to start the exercises.
We'll go through all those exercises.
You will have a test next week.
We'll just be exercises.
You will have a test after we complete the exercises.
So not the session coming up, but the session following that.
Fantastic.
Love it.
Love it.
And that test will allow you to set your benchmark.
And the book is set up to do this for you.
Right.
So if you're following along, if you're one of the many people who are following along and wrecking, wrecking this class.
Right.
You'll know exactly from the exam where you stand.
Please study your vocabulary.
Memorize your paradigms so that you're saying them in your sleep and pissing off your family.
And thank you.
Thank you.
Keep working hard.
And let's make, let's make your brain huge.
Hail Satan.
