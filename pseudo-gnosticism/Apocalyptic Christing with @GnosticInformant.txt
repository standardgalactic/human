Welcome back to the Lady Babylon
This is the Bed of the Muse
And what I want to do tonight
Is to give you a little bit of the future
I'm gonna pull it back
I'm gonna stand right here
Where we are to get it
I'm gonna share it with you
Because that's what you want
To see something new
And you want to expand
You want to have your eyes opened
You wouldn't be here
If you didn't want to have your eyes open
We're gonna start
Tonight
And by the way, thank you, Teddy Bass
Thank you, Teddy Bass
There's a couple of albums that Teddy
Has composed and put together
And engineered for your
Masterful
Reprogramming
Yeah, definitely
It's lovely, some nice Teddy Bass music
If you want to listen to it
Do I make any money off Teddy Bass?
No, I don't
What I am here for is not
To be making money
And for all of those of you who are writing in
And are saying, this is fantastic
That you're not doing this for money
No, stay not monetized
You see
That's the way you
Get around to the back door
Do you understand?
Yeah, it's nice
Anyway
Yes, what are we doing? Teddy kicks
Yes, he does
Yes, he does, buttocks
Everybody loves him, don't they?
I do, a couple of albums
With everything
That we've been doing here at Lady Babylon
They're nice, man
They're nice, take a look at those
Let us get to the
Real tonight
That's where we're going
And all of this was just a little
Hoo-ha dance and show
A little distraction
So that we could get the machine
To get us there safely
And here we are, we're going to step out
Into that ancient right one more time
Now I know people are looking at the thumbnail art
And they're going, oh my god
Oh my god, what is
This going to bring tonight
What sort of
Disaster does this
Imagery portend
Don't worry, I promise you
Every time we're together
I promise you a fantastic date
And so look, you have given me your time
Let me to honor you
And give you the best of the best
Are you ready for this?
There's a type, don't bring it up yet
There is a type of person
Who says
What Dr. Hillman says
Only applies
To the medicine
All of this Christing talk
None of that applies
It's all strictly medical terminology
Now I told you people
From the very beginning
Satanic congregation
I told you
They will take you
They will distract you
And they will do things to you
And if you even know it
You will be violated mentally
They will tell you
That the Bible doesn't have
These technical terms
That this is only doctors
And they do that because
They are ignorant
Of their own
Texts
The real weakness of Christianity
Is Christians
Yeah, the real weakness
So what we have done here
Is satanic congregation
We have taken your tax
And we have re-
Asserted control
They don't belong to you anymore
You can't even read them
You can't even read
Your own holy books
Somebody will tell you
In the future
Dr. Hillman
Dr. Hillman knows the medical stuff
And G. Golly
Beaver
His
Knowledge of the Greek
Is just too strong
For us to wrestle with directly
But there is a difference
Between the medicine and the Bible
There is no Christing
They will tell you in the Bible
Chewie, get us to the place
Where there is Christing
Show us what is it
It's in the apocalypse
It's in the apocalypse
If you want to be the closest to the Greek
You are going to say apocalypse
Not revelation
Apocalypse
And what does he say
First word
I counsel you
Who is this talking
This is the great
This is the great one
Listen
Listen
What does he counsel
Just look at the last two lines
Halfway through the second to last line
Cholurion
In Christi
Do you see that second to last word
On the second to last line
In Christi
What do you think that's from
Give it to him
Did you people not even read
Your own texts
No, that's the problem
The weakness, the Achilles heel
Of Christianity is its own ignorance
Its own ignorance
They can't beat you
If you know
Their texts
Better than they do
And that's the fun
You see how that works
The trade off was I can't make any money off it
What did I get for that
I got that muse
I got that connection
Isn't that gorgeous
Pure
Pure incense
That's the stuff that gets you to the gods
Love it
Love it, are you ready
What is the big man telling us
Here in the apocalypse
He's telling us I want you to
In Christ, wait
Before we go to the drugs
Chewie, I know you love the drug stuff
Before we go to the drugs, go back
What is he telling you on the bottom line
Look, doos of Thelmus
Su
Your eyes
I want you to Christ your eyes
And why, why, you can go ahead and change it
Why would you want me to Christ my eyes
Big G
Why would you want me to do that
Ah
So that you
May see
So that you may see
Do you know what they were doing
They were using drugs
Using drugs
To see
And hear
They were using drugs
As religion
What you have
By faith
Is not the original
Ah
What you have by faith
Lacks the purple
What you have by faith
Lacks that little kid
That was with Jesus Christ
When he was arrested in a public park
Screaming, I am not
A child trafficker
It's the same stuff that went down for
Moe
It's the same stuff
It's that Bacchic blood
That gets in your veins and next thing you know
You're out with a bunch of people
Holding up a snake
You want to hear the voice of God
You got to follow those monists
You got to follow those monists
That virus
That infects the history of the human brain
Akhenaten
You got to go with the monists
And destroy everything
Right, right
Oh my goodness
No, let's not
What are you people doing
If they found enjoyment
In that proposal
Something's wrong
Think of the great mother
Do you know what kills Nazis?
The great mother does
Oh
Isn't that lovely
Listen to the power
Listen to the power
So someone will say
Hey
What this person is saying
In the Greek does not apply
Because that's a specialty
You tell that person
You tell that person
You need to read your own Bible
You need to read it
You need to read it
Let's go to the next one
Look, this is the
Now I wanted to start this
I just want you to notice people
What kind of drugs for the people who are new
Who haven't seen what kind of drugs they are
And for the people who are learning
Greek at all and you
Try to follow some of these words
Through here in the blue
Watch what happens
What is a pharmacone?
It's a drug whether healing or noxious
Right
And look
It's frequently used by
Determined what kind of drugs are
By the epithets that are with them
And he gives us some name
Look at the one
The one that is
Killing the pain
You need painkillers
You got cacopharmacados
Bad drugs baby
You got man killers here
Androfonon
That's a man killer
What kind of drugs?
You got pionian drugs
You know where you are if you got a pionian drug
You
Are in the second, third, fourth or fifth heaven
Wait
What is that? How do I go there?
It's a trip
You're gonna love it
Are you ready? You thought your vacation was good
You got Thanacema
Defendusers
And you got Olethrion
Destroyers
Oh god
So many different capacities
To do with the drugs
Now you know why there's so many
Dymones and why it is
That Jesus Christ right after he gets off
A boat and somebody's like
I heard you healed all those people
That had those demons and ha
Bring the demons my, got this little girl
And she's whacked out in the eschaton
Lady touches
This gown
Nobody's ever understood why it is
That you can reach out
Touch the Christ
And be healed
Do you know how that is?
Cause if you got an issue of blood
He's got
Your drugs
Embedded
He's walking around with linen
That's embedded with these drugs
This is do it
It's how they take these things on a chronic
Basis
There's no fairy tale
People
It's all just anthropology and science
It's gorgeous, would you know that?
That's why you came
Give it to him
Go ahead, give me the next one
I want to give him the next one
This is exciting people, watch what happens here
Here's that
God that definition
I knew this was going to end up this way
So I'm going to take a section of this
And I'm going to blow it up for you people to see
Ready? The definition of
Drug
In Greek, what does it have?
What does it include?
You see the Christ up top
You see the in Christing
Underneath that
You see the epichristing
Right? Christon
Inchriston, epichriston
And what do you do?
When you do that, when you use a Christ
You're doing things
Just like our texts are telling us
You're putting a cream
Into the eye
You're putting a cream
Into the eye
You mean they did that kind of stuff?
What do you think a Cholarian is?
What do you think a Cholarian is?
How
Are you going to get to the third heaven
For the sake of your redemption
If you don't
Use the Cholarian
Jesus Christ is the one
Who will give you that
Yeah
Now if you haven't had that
And you are a monist
That is an Orthodox Jewish person
A fundamentalist Christian
Or Taliban
From
Islam
If you're of that monist inclination
This
Is not going to be something
You have ever done
You have no salvation
I have a message
Amen
I have a message to you all tonight
You have no salvation
Yeah
You don't know
Yes, you don't know
You've got to be careful
Ignorance of the Word of God will kill you
Love it
Love it, let's go
Go to the next one
Oh, it's just
It's going to get somewhere
It's beautiful and I hope you like it
What else can you Christ
Look at the middle word
Right, that's a beautiful
Participle
Gorgeous
And what are you Christing here?
You're Christing your arrow
You're Christing your arrow
What are you Christing?
What are you Christing it with?
You're Christing it with desire
With desire
You ever Christ an arrow with desire?
Mmm
Do you know what you can do with that?
You can have a drug
That will
Turn somebody
Into a lover
We're going to see that
Lover tonight
You mean they had drugs for that?
Yeah, they called them
Aphrodisiacs
Aphrodisiacs
Okay, is everybody caught up?
New people have come
And they started watching you
Oh God, I don't want to go through
That whole rigmarole
Ron, I totally get you
I totally understand that
Now you're caught up
When we're talking Christ, we're talking drugs
And we're talking very specific
Kinds of drugs, we're talking drugs
That induce vision
And drugs that make you
Aroused
Okay
You mean salvation
And sex
Are part of the same
Straight shot through history?
Yeah, they are
They are
Isn't that something?
Is that fruit?
Opens the eyes, you're going to end up naked
Rides and there you are in the garden
Shouting
Awa or Eve
Ah
Life is beautiful, no?
Ah, let's get it
Okay, give me the next one
Give me the next one
Boom
People, what else can you have?
Christ did, I forgot this one
Excuse me
Eos in Christes
That is the injected
Poison
The injected poison
And then they use the word here
Sting, and they're not far
Off
Because they know
The Victorians who wrote this
The Victorians who wrote this
Know that
The person is being
Penetrated
By this power
That is injecting
Something into them
That's what they view as the sting
And that's why they say rio
Rio is the word for the sting
Of the gadfly
Of the gadfly
People will also
Tell you funny things
They will tell you funny things about that
Do not believe them
Go to the evidence
People, you can always just pull out the evidence
Right, that's the fun thing
Any of us can do this
Right, I can do it, you can do it
We can all do it
Show people and they're like, huh?
You can't argue against language
Right, okay
So here's the in Christing
That's the injected poison
Where that eos really hit you
Like Paul with his thorn in the flash
Ah
Junkie
Paul's a junkie
All you people who have so much respect
Come here, Paul, here's your venom
Oh yeah, you want to go to heaven, Paul
Yeah
Yeah
Sick, sick junkies
Go to the next one
Here's the collurion
And what is the collurion?
Somebody wrote to me and said
Hey, how do you tell about dialectical differences
Right, because we read that comment
And said Hebrew has no
In dialectical differences
Between something
That supposedly is written by Moses
And something that was supposedly written
You know, 700 years later
What?
There's no dialect, you got no dialect
How do you tell that kind of stuff?
Or collurion?
That Omicron Upsilon in the middle
Will drop to just an Upsilon
Depending on where you are
What dialect
You're speaking
This happens to be Ionian
Ah
Do you love that? That's how you trace that kind of stuff
Through the vowels
Neil is going to talk about
Some vowels tonight
Love it
So do it Neil, you better get that done
Good, alright, are you ready?
Collurion, what does it mean? It's a passory
Wait, Jesus is telling me
To put a passory in my eyes
Yep
What is a passory?
Can you imagine
I was laughing with Chewie today
Chewie said something about Victorians
You know, and Victorians speak
Because Chewie reads a lot
Of Victorian literature
You know
Anywho
You know, we have to look at it
Through their lens
In order to define some of these words
You know, you can imagine
You wouldn't say something the very same way
You know
You'd besmirch yourself
Right, go besmirch yourself
Let's see
Passory, what's a passory?
It's a little pill that you take
And you put into one of your body's orifices
Right, now there's two that they use
On the mail you can use one
To direct them, but typically
These are developed for women
To use vaginally
For the sake of
Of stopping conception
For the sake of abortion
For the sake of the regulation
Of a
Minstrel flow
Be it too much or too little
Yes, and for the sake finally
Of STDs
Yes, yes, they claim
That certain STDs
Are treated with certain plants
And animal products
That's fantastic, so you make a little
One of these, choleria
And you take it, and what do you do with it?
You apply it as a medicine
But look at number two
It's also an ISAV
An ISAV
And it usually comes stamped with a physician
Seal, right?
And look at number three, it says
It equals cholura, well look at that
But what are these things
Little pills that you
Will prepare by
Heating and robbing and then adding
Some of them are added to liquids
Turn it into a paste
That you then apply
To your eyes
To
Your eyes, now I know
There are not many of you seated in the audience
Tonight
There are not many of you seated in the audience
Who will have ever applied
A psychotropic substance
To your eyeballs
But you can see people doing it
You can imagine somebody doing it
It doesn't take a lot of
A lot of
Imagination to stretch to
Christing
Christing is something
Chewy, you can see them
Christing, you can see what they're doing
Fantastic, go to the next one
Go to the next one
Boom, and what is the
Cholura
Well, they tell us here
They tell us here it's the colics
Well, what's the colics, give me the next one
They're playing a Victorian game with me
What are you doing
To roll
Wait, what, to roll or loaf
Yeah, a roll, excuse me, a roll
Is that a, no, it's a roll
Or a coarse bread
What?
Look at number two, because that's how
I always see it, torojisco
Robbed and taken in wine
It equals a Cholurian, they're talking
About the shape of it
It's a little cake
It's a little cake, it comes prepared that way
You go to your drug stand
You take your doctors
First of all, you use your doctors prescription
They tell you, you need this
Put it in Christ, put it in your eyes
And you go down to the drug stalls
And you say, hey, Dr. Sonso
Gave me this, what do I need
And they bring up a little bit
One of these little pastiles
They'll bring up one of these little cakes
For you to take, one of these little trojisco
For you to prepare and they'll tell you
This is how you prepare it
And you will go home and you repair it
Just like they told you how to do
And you will Christ
That child's eyes
So that you can burn off
Their immortality
And make them more
Immortal
That's what you need to do
No problem, I can do this
The priests will tell you
Bring these drugs to the initiation
Right, this is all
Contemporary with Jesus
Who's walking around
Wearing the same drugs on his face
In the Garden of Gethsemane
That they're using
And ritual, there is no separation
Christians will come to you
And they will tell you
Orthodox Jews will come to you
And they will tell you
Taliban will come to you
And they will tell you
There is a wall of separation
Between the faithful
And the unfaithful
No, no there isn't
Historically there just isn't
And that's why the two
Are mutually destructive
Why they will try to destroy each other
Yes
There is a vaccination
For the mental
Virus
Of monism
There's a vaccination for it
And it's called reality
If you can open up somebody's
Inner reason because we are
All children
Of reason
If you can open that up
And show somebody
You can inoculate them
Who was arrested in the public park
With a naked boy
Let's go to the next one
I want to show you a little bit of beauty
Take us out
That's good, where were we
And here's that colics
What is that colics?
We got that, go to the next one
Boom
And here's the trojisco
And if you think it's really not
Something related to drugs
Look at number two
It's not anything from sobs to medicine
It gives all sorts of authors
Their right
And he says Galen of course
It's the standard people
That nobody ever reads in classics
Galen
Soranus
Orabaceous
Orabaceous
All physicians right now
Should we cut them out and say
What the words are that
They use don't apply to the Christians
We absolutely can't
And people are beginning to see that
And I'm telling you
There's going to be an opening
Of an understanding
Of this very point
Very soon
It's coming
It's already been set in motion
And it's coming
And when it happens you will see
How the Bible scholars
The rabbis, the mullahs
How
And how far
A field
They have come
From the original
Yeah
We are today living in a figment
Of our own imagination
Yeah isn't that something
Let's go it's wonderful hit the next one
I want out right who wants out
What did I see when I've been Christed
I see this
Great angel
And he's announcing in this big voice
Is whoever is worthy
To open
To open the book you mean they had books
No
No
To open up the process
That is written on the scrolls
Whoever wants to do that
Has to release
The seals
Has to release the seals
Do you want to do that tonight
Let's go release the seals what are the seals
Tell me please what are the seals
Again they're drugs
Look at the seals they're drugs
They're drugs
Look at number three give me the next one
Give me the next one
What are the seals
They're tablets of Lemnian medicinal earth
Certified
As such
By bearing the impressions of the seal
Of the Lemnian
Priestess of Artemis
Do you want to know what the mark of the beast is
Do you want to know what the mark
Of the theriac is
It's that
Lemnian Artemis
Because you're not going to get there
Unless you get christened
And you remember don't you who was
Who invented christing
We're going to see
Oh god
Let's go let's go next one
Boom
And oh this is just
Yeah this is for the seal
This is the seal
You can talk about a seal as a pastel again
Look at B
It says
What is that it's the seal of Pachius
And Pachius is one of the
Physicians who's guaranteeing what
An ISAB
An ISAB and where are they getting this
Galen I told you nobody reads Galen
Who's a class assistant
Very few
Sabs were certified
By seal impressions
Does everybody see
Where we have landed
Now everybody should be caught up
And with this knowledge now
We can go forward with something big
Let's look
Let's look at the origin
Of this seal
And these drug using cults
Let's look at the origin of it
Give me I think it's the next one
Who is this
It's Aristophanes now this is going to be
A little bit hard on your ears
So I'm going to translate
Aristophanes and I know that
People would
It's Aristophanes he's the
Greek who's the comedian
And Greek comedy is not
Very much like modern
English
You know American or European
Canadian
Australian
Any of the English speaking
Countries where I can talk
About comedy with any
Accuracy
You don't really see
The Greek comedy coming
It's very it's what you would call
Banel
It's very banal and it makes fun
Of very simple
Processes that would cause us
All to enter into shame
Hide your shame right
Well comedy doesn't hide your shame
Comedy takes it off that cover
Right it lifts up that kilt
And shows you exactly what's underneath it
And that's what Aristophanes is doing
And I figured that's why he'd love them
Why I should bring him on our date
This is the chorus
And we're going to read this backwards
These are the lines that follow
The introduction of
Cersei into the discussion
And this
We're going to read it backwards
This is the chorus in the chorus
What does the chorus say
It says look
You're Cersei
You're the one who
Anna Kukosan
Who mixes together
The drugs
I know you're the one who prepares
The cocaine
It's the same route
I know you're the one who
Maganeu san
Who is that
Magi
You're performing that magic
And what else are you doing
What are you doing
To your lovers
Or your companions
These are the people that she keeps
Captive
What do you do to them
You moluno
Where's the, give me the next, right there
What does it mean to moluno something
What does it mean to moluno something
It means to
Disgrace it, to stain it
To diet
To
Baptize it into the defilement
The abomination
Baptized
That's what she's doing to them
Hmm, let's see what that is
Let's see what that is
It may be interesting from those
Back to the text
Good, she defiles those companions
Right and
What is the spirit that is moving all this
It's pure joy
Pure erotic joy
And you know what we're going to do
We're going to mimic
The son of Laertes
Who's that, that's Odysseus
We're going to mimic Odysseus
And we're going to string that guy up
By his testicles
Don Orcheon Kremomen
Let's
String him up by his testicles
Why would we do that
Why would we do that
So we
Can spread
Poop
On his little nose
Like a goat
And he can say
Mommy, mommy
I'm your little piggy
Yeah, that's what it says
Right, right
That's what's going to happen
We're going to do what, Chewie
Did you get that? This guy's a weirdo
Aristophanes, what's he talking about
Hit me with the next one, let's clarify
Let's clarify, remember we're reading backwards
Where do we, oh by the way
Just in case you didn't think
The smear with poop
Was
Was
Real, look we're not, this is educational
Get your act together, Chewie
Listen, to be smear with
Dung, that's that Victorian
Way of saying to spread
Some feces from
You know where, on your nose
On your nose
Look what we're doing
People, look at number two
We're making an abomination
Until you see that
Abomination of desolation
Sitting in the temple
It's going to have
Poopy spreading powers
Why, people
Anthropologically and historically
Why, seriously poop on the nose
What's that going on, because if you
Are engaged
With the right
You are besmirching
Yourself with the seed
You're going to get poop on your nose
Yeah
Straight up, people
That's why Aristophanes
Is making fun
Funny, where are you
Sticking your nose
Okay, let's go to the next one
It's ancient Greek comedy
Huh?
Who invented this stuff
You know who invented comedy
Was the Greeks
I'm sure there were
Calculative people telling jokes
But it was the Greeks
Look at the Revelation people
Who are these people who
Stained themselves, now for the Christians
Who want to think that there's a distinction
Between their world and the pagan world
Watch, they're using the words
The exact same way
Who is really going to be favored
With Jesus Christ when he comes back
With his golden bra
It's the kiddies
Who haven't malunot
Themselves with the ladies
Why
Why
Because the stain
Is part of the right
And that stain
Is coming from the cup of her
Pornaea
She is born up
By the theriac, by the beast
She balances
The beast, don't you know
That kid needs his
Mortality burned off
Give me the next one
Give me the next one, look people
What's going on, I'm going to give you the next lines
From Aristophanes, they're the first lines
I did the latter half of
This is Karyon
Speaking, and he says
This is what I'm going to do
I'm going to mimic
I'm going to copy
Cersei, the one
Who prepares the drugs
And the one who
Gives those companions
Who makes them that power
She persuades them
What does she persuade them to do
He says they're in Corinth
What does she persuade them to do
She persuades them
Because they're piggy-piggies
Eat a poop
Estian score
Score, you know what score is
That's what comes out of her
Backside
Score
She compels it, she deals it out herself
It says she herself
Brings it out, she molds it
We're going to follow her ways
You little porklings
Going who, who, who
Oh, I want it
Mommy, I'm a piggy
That's what it says
Look at the last line
We are the little pigs, mommy
Give us the score
Like a goat
Like a goat
That gets my goat
That gets my goat
It actually gets my goat
For people who missed
Penelope last time
I'm sorry
And if you'll notice
We are censoring both
Penelope
We're covering up her sin with a cross
But some of you may notice
A strange phenomenon at work
Something funny is going on
Our
Grand artificial intelligence
Is
Giving us things
Perhaps it shouldn't
We got to censor some of those as well
We will cover a multitude
Of our sin with a cross
We will do it, we will do it
I love you Penelope
I love you and I love seeing
Your sin
I do because it reminds me
Of the cross, of the Christ
Who puts that stuff in those little kids' eyes
Yeah, I love it
He is no
Child trafficker
Roman SWAT squad
Woo
Let's go back
We're almost through it
Then I'm going to call on Neil
Who knows what he's going to say
He told us he would stick by
Alice and Hesechius tonight
So it should be good
It should be good
Let's go
He doesn't want to take you out of Back Alley
He doesn't want to take you
He doesn't have to worry about that
But you have
Names
In Sardis, right?
And what do they do?
They maluno themselves
They maluno their gowns
They maluno their clothing
Right? No
You're going to go around with me and white
You're going to go around with me and white
Because
You're worthy, baby
Do you see what's going on?
There's a thing here
Between Jesus and his
He's connected with the stuff
Those kids and he have formed
A relationship
He's saying unless you can enter the
Kingdom of Heaven in this way
You can't at all people
So drink your snake killer potions
It won't hurt you
Watch this for the one who overcomes
He's going to be wrapped up
In these white
Hymations
And I won't blot out
Their name
From the book of Zoe
Right? We still have
In Christianity
We still have
That anti-monist tendency
To reach out to the Eve
We still have
A drive to do that
Right? Okay, go to the next one
It's underlying the religion
It's underlying the monism
And what now? What's the real
What's the real, okay
We've been talking for a long time
About cult stuff
People are starting to understand
More people are getting interested
Starting to open up those texts
Wonderful things happening
Gorgeous
We're riding a wave
Right? We're riding a wave
All we have to do is get this out there
And you will see the renaissance
People will be born
Because that's how it is
It's not anything
That I invented
We're not going to sell it
Or bottle it or anything like that
This is just stuff that happens in history
Soon as the classics start bubbling up to the surface
The monism loses its strength
And what is this?
I've been talking to you for a long time
And I really
Haven't shown you
What happens
When you have that communion
When you enter
Into that death and resurrection state
What are those things that they're trying
To do
When that little boy is with Jesus
Right?
What are those christings
Actually achieving?
This says what the christings achieve
Says from the throne
Pour out
Those of you who have ears to hear
I forgot, those of you who have ears to hear hear
He said that about 18 times by now
Okay
From the throne
Wink, wink
From the throne
Pour out what?
Show me what these are
He says these are the seven
Holy Spirits of God
Being God has seven Holy Spirits
I thought he only had one
And that one plus one
Plus the sun make three
In the trinity

noise generated by the m psychic by the what yeah the grease aren't understand sometimes by the in
psychic the part that is psychic being in action animated they call it these the translation
animated for this so what is your voice it's the sound of your animation

God isn't that gorgeous we're almost done people we're almost done watch this hit me with the next one
who are we doing this all for now this is some Greek and you can guess whether or not
this belongs to the Bible or this belongs to something pagan that's not the Bible right the
only reason we have the distinction between the Bible and what is not the Bible is to create that
barrier what is Jew or Gentile what is Christian or non-Christian what is Taliban or what is defiled

through an intermediary who was arrested in a public park at 4 a.m. with a naked boy screaming
I am not a child trafficker I am not a child trafficker and that naked boy had a medicated
bandage on his private parts as he should have if he were acting within the rights of the mystery
the reality that is here is being uncovered it is an antichrist it will be the antidote

for me to do that i'm going to give you the stage not chewy shoot him with a laser with
your bowcaster if he deviates from the classical sources you understand me if he deviates okay
i'll be back it's your stage neil hit these people there's 837 so be respectful to these people
love it go wow 837 people what's going on y'all so i have actually pinned the tip of the chat
the source material from which i've gathered today that you can you can all go and get the link for
yourself and look into this stuff it's all there shout out to hisekius sixth fifth sixth century
grammarian living in a time where it's post it's post apocalyptic world and it's christianity is
now reigning supreme the adosius is is enacting all these all these laws shutting down the pagan
temples i even found out recently this is all coming in my next video that there was a decree
issued that literally made the bhakik chance illegal for grape harvesters because they had
such a problem with the the people who were in charge of grape harvesting were all but obviously
they're all bhakins right and they're all part of the ritual was to chant yeah oh yeah oh yay yo
yay yeah yes uh and that that was part of their their ritual to make these bhakik chance while
they're harvesting grapes the adosius had a decree and then they had another decree in like the seventh
century and they had to reissue this decree remind them it is illegal to use the to bhakik chant yeah
so that's you'll see that in my video i don't have that exact uh screenshot but if you want to pull
up the screen right here this is what led me down this path so just want to give a quick shout out
to carl karenny because he has in his book appeared viewed by princeton from 1976 he says that there
is a tablet from naso's crete in my sony and linear b that actually has the name for dian ices
called yawaka yawaka and then he he cites yakar the name sirius which he says that's here's the
name of the tablet you can look it up i'm actually i actually will show the tablet in my video i don't
have that here right now but from arastophanes we know this is the name of bhakis because he
arastophanes says yake yake o yake uh nuteru teletes phosphorus ester kindles the flaming
torch is brandishing each one in hand yakos yakos the light bringing lucifer star of the
nocturnal mysteries so he cites just to get you up to speed of how i even got here he cites
hisekius right here for his lexicon so let's go let's let's talk about hisekius right first of all
we have a god named yasio you already have that root yaw in there it's a healer god some people
equate him with adis you know he's a mystery god he's he's invoked the mysteries there might be some
drug condom uh drug references there a bind we and i make something to do with his name
and you'll see this in a second when i get to the um when i get to the uh uh material so we all
know this chant we all know this source i've been brought it up here many times that the
caldeans refer to dianesis as yaho called sabo oath or sebazias right so here we go
right off the bat the yoe is a bakik shout this is one of these banned bakik shouts that was banned
by the church any loud shout or cry of men and women right or the sound of the lear as known as
says is the yoe so i just want to before i continue i just want to um put me on a full screen for one
putting on a full screen for one second i just want to lay something out real quick
the fiercest is the magic wand of the bakins dianesis's staff is called a fiercest the main ads
if you were a if you're a main ad if you really want to be a main ad and i encourage you to become
a main ad this is a this is the religion of the future that i would love people i would love to see
get yourself a fiercest so go out get yourself any any stick from you know nice nice rod nice
perpendicular straight up and down stick from nature but add a pine cone to the tip of it
tie it with a purple ribbon and then you have yourself a fiercest it's a magic wand the fiercest
in in the magical greek magical papyri mystical rites is the letter iota the letter iota is a
magic wand that's why it's up and down and it could have an aspiration on it it could have a rough
breathing on it it can be you know you put your dot on top of it all that you know the different
different forms and different paradigms that we see the iota with but when you add a vowel to it
that's the magic the magic comes when you add a vowel to it so how you tune that magic wand
is how you perform the magic all right let's let me explain now let me put my money where
i'm at let's put this put the source back up if you don't mind chewy chewy is always on point
so yo a is one of these shouts right so iota plus omega gives us yo a right now this is interesting
yeos yeos is a bach it's actually an apollonian shout so yaho is a bachic shout but we know
that apollo and Dionysus are two faces one of them's heavenly the other one's chthonian
they're both the princes of Zeus right and so apollo and Dionysus as acromius tells us are the
same god the yeos the yeos is the apollonian shout the yaho is the bachic shout remember that
it's also the second the second definition we get it's a mourning grievous as Sophocles says
yeos bo a cry of mourning from Euripides thank you ellis for those sources love it so here's
here's a passage from Plutarch from the mouth of his teacher Amonius talking about apollo
this is one of his uh the famous by the way if you know about Plato Plato Plato's sage is Socrates
but if you read Plutarch Plutarch does the same thing but his sage is Amonius so Amonius is like
Socrates where he writes nothing down and everything we know about Amonius is through the dialogues
that Plutarch delivers as Plutarch was the student of Amonius so Amonius tells him apollo
is this yeos this is like one of the only few sources where we get that word yeos so this is
these two sources Sophocles and Euripides mentioned this yeos as a title of apollo
by the way Jesus's name starts with ye in the front of it so that's something to just keep that in
mind ye Jesus it's not hell Zeus it's something deeper than that right so there's that ye in the
front it has to do with healing it has to do with drugs and then as you're going to see it has to do
with purple too I have all these sources ready to go so all right so apollo or um uh Plutarch
through the mouth of Amonius talks about apollo being called ye use all right what's going on here
so let's talk about this yeos yeos a poison a poison from serpents Venom of a mad dog right
remember the cunecus the the uh the cynics the dogs that's that look at honey with snakes feet on
so you're so we're we're dealing with ye or yeos having to do with drugs having to do with Venoms
having to do with bokeh chants mourning rituals let's keep going yeah arrow what arrows it's
always it's you're gonna notice uh you're gonna notice a trend dipping arrows and poison apollo
Dionysus mourning or rejoicing either you're mourning for the death of the god or you're
rejoicing for his resurrection watch this we're gonna keep going so that's the arrow the same
exact word can also be a voice or a cry as Herodotus ascalus and Euripides all report and
their different sources so it's either an arrow or a cry right that's weird all right yay the word
yay by itself is an exclamation of joy or grief can be either one it's a shout by the way you
notice how in english we we do this we when we're happy we go yay yay it's like it's like wired in
our our society to do these things the ancient Greeks set up the society and it's all trickled
into our culture we don't even notice it i love it so that's that yay exclamation exclamation
so i'm going to keep going on the yas i have a lot more to go but just out the top this is from
Hesekius's lexicon where he says yatai is healing yatra fees for healing whatever that means
yatros is a healer a prophet or an ancient hero or apollo right yaw yaw yay yaw yay is sleeps
so you're gonna get this is another another thing we know it's the incubation cults
of magnagracia they're they're big into these ancient mystical asclepius apollonian rites of
incubation and uh and psychedelics so you're gonna see a lot of sleeping and incubation and
resting with the yaw root in there yios bed yaw sleeping right yaw sleep because they slept or
was sleeping what's going on here let's continue with our with our search so here we go we got yay
as a voice to a shout or to be awake uh yay doness yay doness joy desire and happiness so notice
how it has to do with the state of consciousness whether whether it's rejoicing or it's morning
it has to do with that bachic mania bachic mania that that's everyone you know about bachic mania
right now that's the big thing but if you also notice it has to do with yat yator means doctor
yay tori means medical um let's see here wrapped tied wrote mourners so epithets of apollo there's
that one that we just talked about yay yos so let's continue now if you now if we if we tune
that vowel from yay to yo we get something similar right so once again we see arrows
with yaw yosin yaw yosin arrows right violet colored purple colored yolada purple there's the
purple again we that's another reoccurring theme that keeps popping up see this word right here
from colonicus yoson yosonos yosonos purple belt what all right and then on the top yobacos
bachis dianesis the bachic rites all right so just you know this is you can always come back to this
what look at this other one yo aid this black flowery in a in appearance or purple so you're
seeing the common commonly throughout all these different yo yay ya yay and uh um yo ye yay
and you all of these are tuned vowels with the iota on there and they all have to do with purple
drugs arrows or healing or some sort of shout right let's continue now now we tune the vowel to
the oop salon and we see something once again very similar you uh yunk yes which means dian
it's another name for dianesis and it's like without fail we see piercing we see purple
we see shouting we see drugs we see some sort of desire some sort of love charm look at this one
yuk yuk's uh yuk's which is love charm the bird the bird is said to be suitable for enchantments
it is also called renec it is said that aphrodite used it from the bird the charms used in love
spells are called yunk yes so that's the name of dianesis repurpose as a love charm used by aphrodite
it's like wow it's all comes full circle let's continue bachos this is where she gets crazy
because remember what carl karen he said in his book he said that the ancient form dianesis is
yawakos and that it actually turns out that according to the according to ladel scott middle
ladel and lsj that bachos comes from the root wachos the diagramma gets hardened over time
like a like a fossil does and becomes bachos so wachos and yakos is from yawakos or wawako
that's a lot going there's a lot going on there the name of dianesis is yawakos and it's right
there to see in the in alice if we continue then we get that bindweed again right and this has to
do with healing yasione bindweed or if you look at the top yatso of a violet color purple
drugs once again yatso violet color purple drugs healing here we go with yos yos is either arrow
or poison what is going on this is so abundant in the sources the yaw and yaw has always to do with
arrows poison purple or chanting or some sort of healing ritual right it's without fail it's all
over the sources i have so many of these by the way yasione is the mortal that's loved by demeter
also no it's also the word for bindweed or purple color here we go again yasis healing
right purple color that's the same word yatso so here we go healing is yasis or yaw mai there's
that yaw oh literally yaw is in there yatso purple color right yatso also can mean to cry
aloud so it's either a drug to either a shout or it's purple or an arrow or something right
here we go again yatso violet violet color yasis healing again there's the yasion or also called
yasis is the secret mystery he's one of the twins of the of the the the divine twins the diascorides
the diascory yeah it's yasion and treptolomis are the two twins uh here we go so all right i
showed these already and i just want to show something one one more thing i want to show
so yat you mentioned yatra and um if we look at all right we look at the yos where he went through
those if you look at the yas we get the healing and stuff like that but it's also yay here's another
one yay voice shout joy desire fruits purple see that word right there yay yayness purple once again
this is a totally different vowel now so we've gone through yeah we've gone through yo we've gone
through yo yota epsilon now we've gone through yo yota upsilon and now we're on the fifth vowel
yota eta which is total the same exact definitions pull up again doctor doctor uh purple fruits joy
desire shouting all the same motifs are popping up with the eta vowel right oh and before i go on
to my last i just want to just want to uh show something about the lace stays real quick the
word lace by itself means booty or spoil so you understand that lace stays literally doesn't mean
trafficker i didn't even know how right amon was until i figure found out that latest by itself
just means booty or spoil so if you say i'm a lace stays you're saying i'm a trafficker of booty or
spoils it's it's actually like it's yeah pirate and buccaneers fine but like to literally break down
the word what it actually literally means it's booty spoil trafficker all right so last thing i
want to share this is fascinating stuff those vowel tunes with the yota it's like a magic wand
i'm telling you get your main ad out there get yourself a fiercest staff tie a pine cone to the
top and then put a ribbon purple ribbon on there and just carry that around that's your magic wand
baby you got to have it all right last last but not least i have this is also from hisekius
and i just want to show something right real quick this is from hisekius this is the yotros
you mentioned yotros as you were speaking about revelation of the the apocalypse the apocalypse
by the way apocalypse is a common word in the orphic fragments so if you read i'll give you a prime
example one of the oldest books in the world that's that was found in massedonia it's called the um
it's called the uh shit i can't remember the name it's the papyrus that they found
in massedonia it's an orphic papyrus someone in the comments is going to say what it is and i
i'm not looking at the comments but thank you for whoever the you guys all know this stuff
but there is a mass there's a manuscript that was discovered in massedonia in like the 1960s
or some i don't know but it's it's dated to like the fifth sixth century bce at the time of um philip
of massedon and it's attributed to orpheus it's an orphic theogony and like the word apocalypse
shows up in that text like 50 times about orpheus revealing orpheus is a revealing he's apocalypse
orpheus the the and it calls him the theologian so those with the word theologian and apocalypse
are from the orphic text apocalyptic literature for some reason gets oh that's jewish apocalyptic
literature is jewish i actually know before it was jewish it was orphic and by the way the alexandrian
jews in the third century admit this you just look at read their own stuff read aristobulus
read those guys from alexandria writing in greek talking about orpheus as one of their own profits
the word samoi means to play with the harp anyways yotros is a epithet of apollo
just wanted to throw that out there so this is from this is all from hisekius's lexicon
and he goes through all these words in the in the uh iota section and you can see the iota alpha
is filled with all of these purple drug arrow shouts there's so many of them like yeah by itself
purple colored can mean purple colored flowers yakkar is the the kuan aster the dog star baby
the dog star that's also a title for isis too by the way um
yak ton crown he sleeps twisted a flower right yeah i'm just gonna run through these real quick
and then i'm done uh ian ian umai rejoice ian atai angry right iakes to shout
yakketsai shouts yakon apithet of dianysus lament right uh morning let's see
we got more shouts we got more purple more purple drugs right we got
rejoicing we got you i mean you guys get the point by now by the way i pinned on the top of
the chat do you want to look through these yourself it's in the original greek from hisekius i pinned
it to the top it's actually it'd actually be a good exercise for people to go through that
and try to translate them plug those words into um into perseus tufts one by one get your grammar
up that's what i've been doing that's how i made this list right here i've been going through them
one by one and plugging them into um this is this is how i got this list that you're looking at right
now every single one of these words i plugged into perseus tufts and found out what it meant
and it's from hisekius's lexicon so once again shouting you're gonna see shouting a lot it doesn't
matter if it's iota plus alpha doesn't matter if it's iota plus eta doesn't matter if it's iota
plus epsilon it doesn't even matter if it's iota plus amicron or iota plus uh omega iota plus any
vowel you're gonna get a whole list of words that have to do with medical drug stuff purple
healing or some sort or like venoms or something or an arrow sometimes you get the quiver the arrow
or the quiver sometimes you get epithet of Dionysus sometimes you get epithet of Apollo
sometimes you get shouting sometimes you get mourning but those those are common throughout
the entire lexicon of greek iota plus any vowel is these secret mystery words it's fascinating stuff
so um look by the way this one i wanted to talk about real quick
iano iano uh kredemos iano kredemos wait i'm sorry iano kredemos
a poison applied to the headband isn't that something so when you when you put that word poison
with kredemos it becomes poison applied to a headband so and by the way there's that
kray i don't know if that has something to do with crystals but i've noticed to apply it
you get the kray in there i don't know what do you think about that
um i would say because it's a he on the rio side i would say no but don't that's a guess right no
oh i don't like guessing who bring a job keep going man i'm sitting here like eating a popcorn
gorgeous well that's what i so i can go through the rest of this list i think there's only a
few more anyway yeah there's only a few more trip oh here here yeah let me let me share this again
just to finish this off and then that's uh just to show you what else is in here there's a lot to
do with healing therapies so yatio yatui therapies right um healing and then like even fees for
treatment so i'm guessing that this this comes out of the parminidin orphic magic uh asclepian
schools of healers you understand what i'm saying well because they were there was probably some
sort of fee for getting your loved one in there i don't know whatever i'm just guessing i have no
idea where that were fees for treatment yatra and then this one right here yatui is nymphs called
around ellis and healing so it's like you can get two completely foreign concepts that mean the same
thing and it's either healing drugs or some sort of purple drug or some sort of shout i mean healing
purple drugs or some sort of shout so what's the i don't know i just want to i just it's all i'm
doing is i'm looking at the sources i'm not even giving you my own thoughts i'm literally just saying
this is what the sources say there's a lot of purple here there's a lot of drugs here there's
a lot of shouts here there's a lot of cultic rituals here a lot of Dionysus a lot of apollo
and um yeah what do you what do you guys all think about this
fantastic i think it's fantastic um uh look at what you're doing now i want to refocus people
and say look at what neil is doing he's performing a linguistic analysis and it's typical classical
philology that's what that's why classical philology is a science and it's very reliable um
because it's just basic look he said to you i'm just giving you the sources and telling you what
those things meant but look at the the thing special that he's doing i want you to take note
he's using Ezekius who is that ancient Greek grammarian so um and Ezekius is using a source
that's earlier he actually gets traced back to the a Hellenistic source i forget what his name
is eris starkus or something like that and that guy is writing a lexicon of unusual or what he calls
are get this poetic he says poetic words he so Ezekius cites he cites quite a few sources
one of them is deogenius from the time of hadrian eris starkus of samothrace the one you mentioned
is one of the big ones apion heliodorus and another source named amerias so Ezekius has
got all these sources of grammar and he's putting together a bigger source of grammar and this is
how we get ellis today ellis is based on what Ezekius started and that's all it is it's just
building up it's just more noses building upon more noses let me ask you this let me ask you this
neil so um two questions why do you think it is that greek has grammarians and um we don't have
any hebra grammarians why don't we have any hebra grammarians left um what's going on
that i that i don't know but you know you brought this up not now i got to go here because um
people say that yaoi is a native god to and they don't they they know it's not from ugarit
he's not a canian like god everyone knows this this is not a hot take in the ugaritic text which is
the pre pre hebra sources of of of canan right everyone's like ugarit ugarit ugarit ugarit you
got l you got ashura you got bell and you got you got other gods there too right there's no
yaoi in any of the ugaritic sources so it's like where did yaoi come from so this is the big
leading theory right you know you hate theories right but just let me play this you're gonna
love this you're gonna love their promise the leading theory is that he comes from the midianites
down in the south all right why why why do they say that well they found some archaeology of
this name yaoi down in egypt and that these sources from egypt say he comes from the comes
from the midianites sure fine let's check out the midianites now all we don't know much about the
midianites but we do we we have dug up their city their major city midian and guess what we found
out about midian i got a screen that i'd like to share so midian pot this is from the uh encyclopedia
midianite pot pottery also called curia painted pottery is a found in numerous sites stretching
from the southern levant saudi arabia hejaz blah blah blah blah the pottery is bi-chrome polychrome
style and it dates as early as the 13th century bc by the way that's the exact same time is that
naso's tablet that mentions yawaka exact same century ready for this it's many geometric human
and animal teeths are painted in brown and dark reds on pinkish tan slips midianite pottery is
found in its largest quantities in metallurgical sites in the southern levant especially tina
because of the mycenian motifs on midianite pottery some scholars including george mendenhall
pete parr and ben th rothenberg have suggested the midianites were originally sea peoples who
migrated from the aegean and then posed themselves on a pre-existing somatic stratum
the archaeology even points to yawai coming from the aegean it's thionisus don't you love
that tacitus can be right after so many years he called it he said they came from crete and
everyone was like that's not right well the archaeology saying that he might be honest something
and by the way the fact that yawai is not mentioned in any of the ugeritic sources
where is he he has to come from somewhere and if we have yaw and yay and yo all over the greek
and all of a sudden this new god comes up from from the midianites and takes over the cults of
israel becomes this new amazing god and all over the old testament there's vine and great motifs
everywhere golden satyrs in the temple of salomon great vines everywhere israel's called
a vine it's very dienesian herodotus even says when i went there do my studies all the only two
gods they worship was dienisus nephrodite it's it's it's monist neo it's um yawai is the monist
response to bachic worship um and i'm i'm i'm not the only one who talks like that uh
plutarck was talking like that too um it just is akhenaten split off and from the
from the um polytheist origin and made himself the all right just just in that same
monist tendency that's what yahu is right jehovah is a monist response to a bachic saturnian
religion yeah love you know who else says that too is kelsus in the second century
kelsus says that this religion is is he goes he says the jewish religion is not new or something
that's like special it broke off from the ancient rites and he says i think the word he uses was
it's um he says something along the lines of it became uh infected or i think he uses a different
word than that but he basically says that they are corrupted he says it's a corruption of the
ancient rites so i'm not surprised to find a name of the name of the same name of dienisus
found in this god as this and as you said it becomes more of a central leading figure you
know the you know the we know that we know we all know the hypsisterians are it's not nothing new
to greeks monism the pathagarians are doing that shit all the time they're they're arguing back
and forth between do we like homework do we not like homer this is all this ain't new this isn't
just happening in israel just happens that in israel that shit really takes root that those
ideas really take root and and there's nothing wrong with seeing that history for what it was it
doesn't um it's only the theology that breaks the back of that camel you know what i mean it's
it's a theology that says this must be the first divinity and it must be the creation story we got
so many years and our history is going to be that creation story it's only that um group that um that
has those monest you know this drawn to monism that will turn away when you're drawn to monism
you your justice is not your highest standard right your democracy is only there because of
these gods like justice and nemesis right and all the court of the athenians it's all has to do with
that appeasement of the furies right very oh god it's all feminine gorgeous gorgeous gorgeosity i love
it the the caldian oracles are spot on they said you know they call the finnishians had the name
of the Dionysus is yaho and couple that with what they're saying like you know plutar talks about
they're they're they're by the oh this is another one the succot festival it's it's one of the most
one of the holiest date one of the holiest weeks it's a week it's a festival in the it's a festival of
um uh harvest at the end of the fall and it's happens at the exact same week as the thesmaphoria
the law giver festival of Dionysus and Demeter and they it's a harvest festival happens at the
exact same time of the year and you know what they do and plutar writes all about this in his in his
um the in his questions of moralia he says at this as he calls it a thesmaphoria because they call it
a feast of booths or a succot or tabernacle festival and at this festival they do exactly what the
elosinians do they feed they they garnish their tables with with tabernacles and fruits and they
like candles and they drink wine and it's a it's a basically a full-blown Dionysian wine harvest
festival they call this but another thing plutar points this out too did you would you know that
they have four holy plants that they that they carry two of them are are um are oh shit what is it
it's palm trees and let me just look this up real quick palm trees and i have it right here fine is
it queson is it that i find is on the table but they carry myrtle and palm in their hands into the
temple did you know that the that myrtle myrtle is for aphrodite the thesmaphoria they carry palm
trees and myrtle branches into the temple exactly the same way as succot so they're so these right
as just as calysis says calysis is so smart by the way read calysis's arguments against christianity
that book i was a christian when i read that book it messed me up i was like no way this guy's crushing
he says that these rights are the they really are the ancient mystical rights but they're the corrupted
he said they've been deeply corrupted for greed and all this he then goes into this whole thing
but he's right the it's you're looking at when you're when you're looking at judeo christianity
in the second century bc first century and so forth and christianity comes out of it yawism i
think it's the best correct term to use um you're looking at the ancient rights corrupted you're
looking at corruption of the ancient mystical rights that you find in elusis that you find in
samothrace that you find in frigia the frigian mysteries you're just finding a corrupted version
a tweaked a sort of copyrighted version right you know how you get like you know how you got
nike and then you go to the store on the street and they got the fake nikes they're like you can
tell it looks like nike but you're like these are some cheap ass shoes right here that's what
yawism is dude it's the corrupted rights it's what it is just being real yeah yeah it's this
you're being history that's what you're doing is you're looking at the history and that that is
what the bacchic power is meant to do it's meant to cause you to look into that mirror once you can
see yourself then you know the apollonian temple thing of know yourself that makes sense and by
the way i know it's a little something about about those shouts yeah i love those i love that no um i
gotta say niel you put together a gorgeous and absolutely gorgeous linguistic analysis you even
took us you took us through zikius but you took us as far back as the mycenae in greek um which is
where we get that deonus sauce in the first place so brilliant job i can't think of uh you know who
you blew it out of the sky ape that's like a plus work you know what i mean i wanted to bring
that to your last one because you were talking about the name yesus in the last episode for some
reason i passed out like an hour before you went live and i woke up at two in the morning i was pissed
i was like did you feel the swat because i gave you a swat on your buttocks yeah i got it because i
said no i said he probably i said he's exhausted he's probably fell asleep right because you're
working on your stuff like round the clock right nilo text me i don't even have a bedtime i'm just
up until i until my body says go to sleep but not yet it could be four in the morning six p.m it could be
two p.m it could be 11 a.m it doesn't matter whenever whenever my body says enough it's enough
enough researchy shit dude i have a whole pile of books over here right now you you'd laugh if you saw it
it's uh it's dope and i wake up in the mornings and i've got 12 texts from nil and you can just
go through them and see you just track the sources that he was hitting right it's i'm isn't it true
nil that when you get into it and you start seeing the reality in in the greek you just can't i don't
know you just get something here's the crazy part the name yesus has that shout in there
it's in the it's in the name and here's another thing people always say this all the time they go
this is the telltale sign if if if something's mythology it's when you know for example let's
look at asops fables in asops fables the character name the character's name has to do with what the
person's doing so the guy let's say the guy's name is sleepy and he's sleeping a lot in the myth
then you know it's not a real person it's a it's a it's a fable
jesus's name yesus and he's out there healing people applying drugs to people's eyes and his name
is yesus yeah are you kidding me yeah his name that's what i'm so glad you see that because that's
exactly how frustrating it is to tell anybody you know yesus christos is like drug man drugger right
i mean you can't you can't get worse than that you can touch this guy notice you know people
know for a long time they've been like the woman with the issue of blood just touched jesus's clothing
she was like oh it was a miracle you know i mean you saw tonight that there was great for taking a
drug and putting it into oh someone like a priest's headband headband right you know what is that healer
profit well you know if you take that healer profits headband and suck on it you're gonna start
seeing stuff and it had that k k r e root in there i'm you know it may be something going on there
but you know what i'm look i know that yesus was a fairly common name of people in the first
jason is another one yason yesus yashua there's a lot of these i'm not saying these didn't exist
but i'm saying what they wrote about him later is not really it's not historic there's probably a
little bit of historical shit in there probably i actually think there's fairly amount fairly good
amount of historical shit i think he was going around with his with his with his crew performing
all these rights i think there's there's historical truth there but at the end of the day the guy's
name is yesus and he's out there healing people you got to say you guys sit there and say this is
like superman now superman being super you know what i mean this is like you got to say all right
separate the myths from the reality here totally totally and for those of you since you just mentioned
superman i'm gonna have to say um chewie chewie uh demands that um henry cavill reach out to her
she demands it um just wanted to add that in please henry she's holding me hostage henry if there's
any way if there's any way i can get this to you she's holding me hostage please please henry
reach out okay good now she won't she'll leave me alone thanks chewie have the shout on your chest
can you can you tell us about that or show us that what's there it is yay it's exactly what you
were talking about and it's it's pion now i chose the you will see the ea pion you see that a lot
in the text but i chose i found one text that was iodian and it used a longer vowel in the end it
was pionic went ahead and used the omega and i thought that takes guts that takes guts to use
that omega and so i liked it and um yeah it's a special shout it is remember how they have
i was saying tonight i don't know if you caught it neil but i was saying you have pionic drugs
right well that shout that is a part of taking those drugs is that victory that um that that
solar it actually is a solar victory that apollo the lucifer who brings that light yeah
so i love it i love it yeah i mean you get so that's funny because apollo is called lucifer
the day star the sun the day star but dianisus in that and that one etymology that hesekius gives
yakar is the dawn star so the day star and the dawn star but they're both phosphorus
they're both lucifer there's just two different lucifers one of them's the dawn star
other one's the day star isn't that crazy i love it i love it gorgeous man it's gorgeousness and
gorgeosity neil i want to thank you for coming tonight and i want to thank all of the 900 some
people great great that ended up giving us a full hour and 36 minutes of their time i hope
i believe so i don't know probably neil thanks so as well but i hope that you have found things
that justify that hour and a half of your life that you can say oh this this is good stuff man

about this gotta be careful it's it's important to note this might not be true all that careful
shit no one cares tell us what you think tell us what the sources say you know people want people
also want to hide the sources because they're like well if we show them this source it might confuse
