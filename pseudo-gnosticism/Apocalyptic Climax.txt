You're gonna love this.
Mary Poppins
Got a big bag of juju
Where the Necromaxes hang out
And the darkest grew
Coat mystery
Purple drugs on your face
You're at the Roman Crown Circus
Scandalous Jesus
Pharmakia Medea
Got him twisted out
Child sex traffickers
Hung on the cross
Pedophiles fetching gibbits
Fucking hell Satan bitches
Push up the muse
They couldn't hear the dragon tongue
Express effigy
Dark horse
Grim Reaper riding
Rumble bum bum
Drumming tribal
Well, back to the Lady Babylon
That was steady base
Thank you so much, steady base and chewy
For that work
Gorgeous, brilliant job
Boy, have I got it for you tonight
I've been waiting for this one
Thank you for coming back
And thank you for being here
Satanic congregation
Shout out to the sisters of frustration
Out in the lobby
Doing their thing
They sound so disappointed, don't they?
Yes, yes, forget the rumors
Forget the rumors
Tonight we are going all the way back
All the way back in time
We're gonna find our way
We're gonna bring something
Something forward
What you get tonight
Before you get scared away
I hear people are horrified by me
That's terrible
Before this night
You didn't get what you needed to get
Tonight I have not come to you
To prophesy
I have come to you to fulfill prophecy
Tonight Satanic congregation
Just for us
Just for us
We feast on the beast
Thank you for coming
Thank you for coming
Oh, thank you for coming
Where is my whip?
Yes, we're gonna take a short break
Before we get to the climax
And we're gonna have another video
Because these things are telling a story
I just, oh, I love it
I love it, it's Orpheus
Back alive, I love it, fantastic
Chewie hit us with the first
Let's go in, let's go in
Policent, boom, right there, don't
Don't, we'll wait for you to know who
People, look, I wanted to tell you this
So much last week, and I won't belabor it
I'm not gonna belabor any of the sources today
This is a user-friendly edition
Right, we're here to have a good time
This isn't some kind of class
This is fun, are you ready for this?
Thank you for your time, by the way
Everybody out there who's given their time, thank you
I wanted to give you this last week
This is from a source, this is Haseke
I said, I know people will say
It was so late
How can you use such a sort?
Mmm, okay
Hasekeus is, excuse me
Eustatheus is using his own sources
From antiquity
That nobody else around him is
Failing themselves of
He's like the one bright spot
In a stinky dormitory full of monks
Oh, and there he is, he's got these sources
Anyway, he says right here
I just wanted to bring it up for you
He says, look, this is the very rise
Of Greek culture, it comes through
The Leistes comes through Leistea
This is Greek culture
If you don't understand what that is
Go find out
For the Satanic congregation
Hear me, hear me
When I talk about the Helians
Know who they are
And where they came from
Indo-European, ha
Let's go to the next one
Chewie hit it
Now, here comes the real stuff
I told you, I told you
Tonight we get something special
Thanks to the graces of Lucifer
We have tonight this gorgeous fulfillment of prophecy
Are you ready?
We're gonna do this together
It's like having a baby
Let's do this, are you ready?
Oh, this is the apocalypse
What is going on?
I don't know what that was
But it sounds sexy
I love it
What happens?
They figured out the beast
They what?
They figured out the beast
They discovered the beast
Ew, isn't the beast
Yonder creature with necks and flames
And scarlet horse sitting
Thank you for killing everything
Classical civilization brought us Christianity
Thank you, my salute to the queen
Oh my goodness
Bring it up, bring it up again
Boom
Let's watch this fulfilled, are you ready?
They discovered, determined precisely
They determined precisely the Therion
What is the Therion?
Take it down, what is the Therion?
The beast, what is the beast?
Yeah, it's that which bears up Lady Babylon
It is that which brings the cup
That's the beast
Are you ready to dive into the beast?
Are you ready to find it?
And the Christianity will give you all sorts of images
They're the most hilarious, self denying, lying sacks of
You know what?
What is the beast?
What is the beast?
Yeah, let's watch the fulfillment
What happened?
They figured out the beast
They determined the beast
And who else was using the beast?
I mean, what is the beast?
Bring us, bring us back to John
Come here, John
You little, you disgust me
You disgust me, John
You have everybody you should have known
Oh, you thief
Little thief
Sibling oracles
Let's watch what happens
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
They figured out the Therion
And the pseudo prophet
He was using it
Making signs
Via the agency
Of the beast
And in these delusions
They wandered
Everybody who took the haragma
Wait, what?
Haragma
Do you hear that?
There's no blockage of the air in the he
He, he, he
Everybody say that
He, he, he
Haragma
Haragma
Haragma
Right in the middle of that text
What are these people doing?
They're taking the haragma
Give me the next
I want to see what is this thing
Look, here it is
Blow it up
Haragma
Oh God
I'm sitting here with anticipation
Chewie, hit the next one
The next one, yeah
What is it?
What is it?
Oh, my goodness
Blow it up
Blow it up
Oh, good
Haragma
Look, it's from Haraso
Oh, lovely
And what's it mean?
It's a mark engraved or imprinted or branded
Now look at the Greek
Everybody in the Greek
And be careful
The atheists won't be able to keep up
Right there
They all felt it too
Right, every one of them just went
Ow, was there a bug?
Did I sit on something?
They were right to me
Where did I get these black and blue marks?
You got them on your buttocks, atheists
Okay, what is that?
What is the haragma?
Look at the Greek people
The Greek right here
The haragma ehidnes
The sting of the viper
Right, what does it say?
What does it say?
What does it say right there?
It's very bite
Give me the next one
You mean you want me to see this?
You want me to see what these people are doing?
Do you want to see what these drug-using people are doing?
Are you ready?
This is mystery people
You have to be ready for the mystery
It's all mystery
Oh, those who took that
Well, that's more of a beast, Martha
No, you are so ignorant
Compose yourself
Oh, may Lucifer have mercy on you
Yes, I hope that he does
Sisters of frustration, hit us
That's why they're not reaching the highest peak
Do you understand?
Because Satan rules here
Oh, God, love it
Is anybody else part of the cult?
Is there just me?
Alright, there's just be one
Go, hit us the next one
Oh, God, what was the next one?
This is so...
Look, people, what are they doing with Haragma?
It's the same thing that happened to this guy
And this is where the Christians can't take you
I'm taking you places the Christians can't
I'm taking you places that no rabbi, no priest
No preacher
Now seminarian, I'm taking you places
They'll look at you and go, huh?
What?
Yeah, but we're doing it
Because we're looking for these
The reality
Did we get out of this?
Yeah, we did
Look, here it is
What happened?
This guy's name is Philip T
He says, look, I'm sitting here
Because these generals and this Wanox
The Kefalanians, what did he do?
They left me here
They shipwrecked me here in this Eremon
With this terrible wild disease
Festering in my bod
It was put there
By the strike of that echidna
By its Haragmati
Oh, oh, do you know what it does to you?
Ask Paul
Ask Paul the apostle
Ask Paul the apostle
How far up...
You can drop that one
How far up you can get on this stuff
Ask him
Are you ready?
You didn't want...
Here it is
Here's the beast
Fulfillment
Fantastic
Bring it
Bring the next one
Boom
Zop
Excellent
Before we do that
Go back to the top
We've got to go back to all the wrong
Right there
Boom
Next one
Boom
That one was destroyed
Okay
Look at people
He says, what happens here?
So, look, they figured out the theriac
And the...
Underneath its influence
The false prophet was making the semea
And they were taking the semea
And they were wandering
They were wandering
They were worshiping
They were proskinesising
They were bending the knee
To the image
Of it
Oh, they had the beast
And what did they do?
They took the haragba
Oh, I get it
I get it
Oh, God
And what happened under this?
They took this...
You mean prophet?
What happened?
What happened to the prophet
Who was leading them in the future?
What happened to him?
You know, the future's never going to happen, right?
You didn't get that memo?
Oh, too bad
Let's go!
Go to the next one
Bring it
Roll it
Are you ready?
Oh, Dionysus
What do you have to say, brah?
Nice to see you, brah
What do you have to say?
Put on your boocey-noose petloose
What?
Cover your flesh, baby
Cover your flesh with it
What is it I need?
Oh, it's hot
It's hot, Chewie
Go ahead
This one's coming in hot
We can only take a couple of seconds
Till we've got to go
Oh, God, no!
No, look!
What did I stumble upon?
I stumbled on the purple
Right?
Because that boocey-noose that you're going to see
Which is a...
Let's see if we can find that definition
I think...
I think I lost that poor definition
Well, she'll come up later
She's like a wandering child
People, look what we've got right here
Porphyria, right?
Right?
Porphyra
Oh, they just dug this out
Julius Caesar's
Grandpa's
Beautiful
Luxury home
Down there in Herculaneum
Love it
Remember what Julius Caesar
Hung in the temple of
Venus Genatrix?
Did you guys remember that?
I told you that
He hung the portrait of Medea
The Medua?
Yes!
Yes, he did
He did
Why?
Because they were Donbringers
Yeah, Donbringers
Isn't that nice?
Oh, God, it's gorgeous
There it was
We'll come back to this
But I want everybody to know
I want everybody to know
This fine that they made
In Herculaneum
And the subsequent
Getting the scans
To analyze these charred up scrolls
Oh, God, you're about to receive dumps
We're about to get dumps
Have lost
We're hitting it great
What does it make?
Those two junk pots
Of dead sea scrolls
Look like they're copying
To a dead archaic form
Of, oh, my God, seriously?
Two pots
We have just discovered
Lucifer just buried
Just buried that false history
Oh, my God
What a world we live in
Oh, I love the fact that this is his world
Oh, what did we find?
The library
We found this dude's library
It happens to belong to
Friggin' Julien
The Julien family
Oh, my goodness
You're going to get some great stuff out of this
Let's go to the purple
Since we just stumbled on it
Go
Maybe there's a reason to this madness
Yeah, there you go
People, what am I bringing you?
Look, this is Diascortes
And I just want you to see
I've been talking about the burning purple
And if you look here at number four
Yeah, there's our porfura
Right?
And caesa
And it's in an ehedunum
And serantiqued
Oh, what is this?
This is our burning purple
This is our burning purple
People have been asking me
What's the burning purple?
And what does it tell?
Well, it says it
Right here, people
And guess what?
It's a katastal decay
For hooper sarcomaton
Wait, what?
Yeah
It is a cure
For those growths
Yeah
Yeah
So the purple
Don't be surprised
If it has a huge impact
On your culture
Don't be surprised
Yeah
You know what that stuff does
You know why it's so incredibly valuable
Let's keep going
Let's keep going to the next one
Boom
Oh, what else does he say about it?
Well, I may go back in a second, should we?
But we can reverse in a second
Look at this, people
I just want you to focus on the second word here
Pomata
What are pomata?
Pomata
What are pomata?
They are drinks
Potions
Sometimes translated as spells
Do you hear how bad
Christian translators are?
I'm here to say
Your history, your intellectual history
Is laughably bad
Laughably bad
Yes
Yes, for those of you who think that you invented democracy
Your awakening is my joy
Is my joy in this gigantic penal colony
Called Earth
Your awakening is everything to me
To be able to see your reality
Is that Jesus Christ was arrested in the public park
At 4 a.m. with a naked boy
While he's screaming, I'm not a child trafficker
Your awakening to that reality has given me such pleasure
It's a pleasure that no one mortal should be able to share
Just without any sort of people to enjoy with them
It's like selfish of me
Yes, but to see that, that new birth into a reality
That's something
And I appreciate, I appreciate you giving me that experience
It's right at the top of everything that is beautiful
Thank you, thank you for that
Transformations, I love it
Let's go to the next text
People, I wonder what the next rumor is going to be
Alright, here we go
Yeah, and I sent an angel
Right, and what is he going to do?
He's supposed to witness
Right, right to you people
Right to these churches
Why? Because I'm the root
I'm the root of that defeated clan
I am hoaste, holampros, hoprinos
Oh God, if you don't understand that's an incantation
You haven't lived in antiquity
Fantastic, look at this
He's the star
What is he saying at the bottom? He's saying I'm the star
Who is this? Jesus
Anybody notice we were talking about Jesus?
Congregation of Satan, shout out to Jesus baby
Isn't it going to be gorgeous?
Isn't it going to be gorgeous when we all come to knowledge
And we have perfect precise vision of history
And we see him there
And we know who he was
Oh God, am I going to feel stupid?
I am going to feel so stupid
If I bow down to that pedophile
Yeah, we know he's already been convicted
All we have to do is show the evidence
And it's a wrap up, case finished
Right, nobody wants to follow a pedophile
Right, let's discuss though
Okay, let's do it
Stop saying things
I'm sorry, sometimes I hear you out there
I know it, I can envision it in my little mind
I can envision it out there and I love it
It turns me on, I thought I heard somebody say something
Okay, just think, I'm right there with you
If you're in your car, I'm with you
I'm with you driving, don't get distracted
Right, some of you are overseas
Some of you are at your jobs right now
Tell your boss, tell me a favor
Tell your boss, you're listening
You're listening to Lady Babylon
And if he doesn't give you a raise
Something, something cosmically ugly
Will be imputed to him or her
Yeah, greed
Tell him, hey, I've got a new morality for you boss man
Greed stains your soul
With a stench, a stench of ruin
Oh God, oh God
Love it, love it
Okay, let's go to the next one
Let's get charged up with some really good stuff here, right?
Oh, what happens, what happens?
Oh, who's that?
The devil, what does he do?
The one who made them wander in their minds
The one who took them to that expanse
You remember, Paul was there
I saw what you did, Paul
You went up to the third and started messing around
You know what that weakness of the flesh is
And that's why it's better that you stay with your apostles
Do we have pictures of the apostles?
Do we have disciples?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've got them
Bring on the kids, where are the kids?
Oh people, now here is a very...
Look, thanks to the gift of AI
We are able to now represent for you
With stunning, amazing realism
The historical apostles
Right, look at this kid
You know what he's doing?
You know who that is?
You know who that is?
That's James, man
That's James, who's that?
It's one of those sons of thunder
I know that, maybe he's the one on the back
Maybe he's the one on the back
I don't know, I don't know
Peter's in there somewhere too
Let's hear from the queen
Where's the queen in her little drawers?
Oh, my goodness
Where's Peter?
Surely his wife
Wait, his what?
You think Peter was married?
It doesn't say anywhere he had a wife
Oh, it says he had a mother-in-law
No, my queen
Just in case you didn't know
That was Elizabeth straight from hell
Straight from hell
Elizabeth, shut up
It's a basement, sub-basement
That's where we keep them all
Yeah, okay
Yeah, so it's the word for...
It can be the word for sister-in-law
It can be anything
And guess what?
You can have in-laws
And not actually be married, right?
So there's no...
There's no evidence that this kid
Had any sort of...
He was with his family
And Jesus is like, come on boys
Right?
Okay, stop, stop
We've already been in the trial
Satanic congregation is not here for that
They're not here for that
Secretly they are
Go to the next one
Oh, God, what is that monstrosity?
What is it with Christianity
And all of the...
Sadomasochistic weirdness
What is that?
There's something that's...
That's primal
That's primal
You know what I mean?
Get a group of Romans to beat him
Beat him
Oh, yeah
Feels so good
Notice there are a bunch of people watching it too
Love it
Go
Yeah, and so...
Oh, yeah
So the devil
We're back to the devil, right?
Diabolos
And what happens to him?
He's the one who's just putting these images
Into people's heads
Right?
And he's thrown into the lake of fire
And Thayu
What is Thayu?
Thayu is what you purify with
Thayu is what you purify with
We, sons of John
We bringers of the light
What do we do?
I'm about to show you
What do we do?
We bathe in the fire
And sulfur
Purify ourselves
Yeah
And that's where this prophet
Gains the Thadion
That's where that beast comes alive
Yeah
These
Yahoo
Is gonna throw into the pit
And my name is Jeff Rotee
Merkel for nothing
Listen
The stuff that you've heard is BS
What they're describing here is perfect mystery
Right
And you didn't see it the whole time
Why not?
Because they took away your access
They took away your access
They appropriated
They said this texture
This is the Bible here
That's the word God
And it comes from the
Back when Moses was up all the mountain
It comes from the third century
Yeah
Comes from the third century
And originally it's in Greek
Why?
Because the ancient Hebrew has just tiny, tiny
We've been here congregation
We've been here
I don't wanna keep going here
Let them have the Dead Sea Scrolls
But don't let them
Tell you a fairy tale of history
These are the texts
Go to it
I love it
Everybody needs a spanking
Spanking for everyone's
Everyone out there
Are you out there?
Are you out there in your car?
Where are you spanking for everyone?
Just one
That's just one
Let's go
Okay, stop
Somebody's gonna write to me
About going to hell again
I try to do it, but you know
And what's happening?
Well, it's into the ions of ions
Right?
Where are you going?
You're going into the ion
Where do you think Paul was talking about?
There's a physics here
Fantastic
Let's see what Christ is all about
Give us the next one
Show us
Oh, show us
Let's sit here
Finally, we caught up
Here, look here
I told you, boosting us
Look at this
Okay, bandages
Look, fine linen
Wait a minute
Look at those
Right at the beginning of the definition
It says made of busos
And then it says
Seendon
Right?
It's...
Remember, we talked about the thing
That was wrapped on the naked kid
That was with Jesus
Who runs private parts
Okay
Here
Here we are
Here we are
Right?
For wounds
Remember, I told you
How they use it medically
And they impregnate it
Right?
I wasn't the one who made this stuff up
Right?
This is from antiquity
They're doing it
Okay, so
Welcome
Welcome
Here it is
The fulfillment is here
Here we go
Next one, please
Oh, and I'm sorry
Look at the bottom
Look at the...
Don't let Hesechius
This is Hesechius
Don't miss the bottom
What does it say?
Por furus
What?
The purple is there
You're darn right
And the purple is there
On Jesus
On his fingers
On the stuff on his face
That they're saying
Look at that
What's that stuff?
What's that junk on your face, bro?
When you arrest someone
And take them in
And they had just been arrested
In public park
With the naked kid
And the police
AKA the Romans
Are saying
What?
You know, these soldiers
They're like
What?
What?
You wonder
Why they beat them up
Do you know what happens
In prison systems?
To pedos?
They beat you up
Yeah
Yeah, if they don't kill you
It's a badge of honor
Right?
It's the
Way the system is
The only reason I know it
Is not because
I've watched something on Netflix
No
It's because
I knew someone who was
On the inside
For doing things
To cars
And he was also
A very good
Very good tattoo artist
So he had a
Strong function
And, you know
Behind bars
And, you know
Was kind of protected that way
Yeah, you know
A good tattoo artist
Is hard to find
Do we have any more
Of our tattooed Christians?
What is that?
Go ahead
Bring it up
Oh, flash that
Do we have any more?
Yeah
Do we have any more
Of our kiddies
Or tattooed children?
Do we have any tattooed?
Yeah
No, go ahead
You can do it
Go ahead
There we go
Yeah
Realized somebody asked me
Just recently
About tattoos and antiquity
And realized
That they are indeed
A priestly thing
They are also
Associated with
Kind of some of the wild
Or more
I don't know
People living in caves
You know
When I say cave
Don't laugh
Cave is nicer than
Any of the houses
That you guys have
Right?
I mean
Look at some of the stuff
Look at Pythagoras' cave, dude
Little grotto of the nymphs
Oh my god
Gorgeous
How would you like to live in that?
Do you see the pools
He's gotten everything?
No wonder they go there
All the time to sing
Right?
Tattoos are often associated with dudes
Like effeminities
Right?
Whose skin they removed
And tanned
And capped
As a
You know
Source of inspiration
Fantastic
I love that stuff
Hit us with another source
Hit us with another source
This is why you Christians
You're going to get marked
You're going to get marked
Right?
If you don't have it yet
You may be one of the
Apostate Christians
You know
They're in the text too
Right?
In the text too
One of the Apostate Christians
Oh I like that position
Let's hold it right there
And I
Saw
Behold
A white horse
And the one sitting upon it
Had a bow
Wait what?
Yeah
A bow
This is Jesus
With a bow
Wait
Why does Jesus have a bow?
Did anybody
Did anybody notice
Jesus had a bow?
Of course
He's got a bow
He's the morning star
Your bone head
Where do you think
All of this cult
Came from?
It's those
Crazy horse-riding freaks
Who've got those women
That you can't get past them
They'll kill you dead
They'll kill you dead
They even have to kill
A certain number of us
Oh God
Can you believe this?
He's got his bow there
And
And
What was given to him
And
What was given to him
And
What was given to him
And
What was given to him
And
What was given to him
And
What was given to him
A crown and some stuff
So why?
So he could go out
And
Kill!
Kill baby
Kill
Do you want to know
What the morning star does?
I don't think you're ready
I don't think you're ready
Here
We're looking for Christians
You are not a Christian
If you do not
Have the name of your God
Tattooed on your forehead
Oh my
Seriously?
That's what they said
That's what they said, bro
But they were going
They were
They were using the juice, man
I mean
I don't know how much of this stuff can be trusted
Right
They're putting it right into the skin
Right into the skin
What does it do?
It sits there
And you get it over time
Oh my God
Seriously?
What do you think all the cuts are for?
Yeah
Yeah
You didn't know this was a reality?
Seriously?
Oh God
Mommy
Right
Give it to me, mommy
Right
Oh my goodness
What's she giving that kid?
Hey, call Child Services
I'm not sure that
That cup of purple juices
Legal
In every state
Look
You want her to burn off
His mortality or not
What do you think is more motherly
Than that, bro?
Wait
What are you talking about?
Don't worry
You're modern
You're modern
You're going to get there
And you're going to see
You're going to see Jesus
In his naked boy
Yeah
In the
Yeah, it's all there
I've been there
I've seen it
With my own eyes
Yep
How did I do that?
Same way you do that
We dig up the dead
And we look through their eyes
We put our
Put our little mouse
You want to see what the witches
Those wrong witches
We're doing with freshly dead people
Who just died
Right?
They know they've got
A certain amount of time
Right?
Oh, my God
Right?
You know
You can stimulate some
Boom!
Bring them up
Right?
Oh, God
Next thing you know
She's biting his teeth
I was like
Should this be
Should this be getting me
You know
Interested and intellectually
Should I run to Jesus?
Don't run to Jesus
He's in that park
With the naked kids
Go
Go to the next one
Boom!
There we go
Yeah
Yeah
We already saw that one
Next one
That's the one so he can go out
Jesus got a license to kill
Right?
Who else?
Take down the
Initiating apocalypse, please
Who else, people?
Can we look at this text
Realistically?
Who else?
Who else is this?
Lucifer
Who else is this?
Look at the last line
This is the
Him to Apollo
The Orphic Him to Apollo
Look at the
Look at the line at the bottom
And you see the
Phosphore
You see that?
Who is that?
Yeah
That is
Yosphoros, right?
That's the bringer of dawn
That is the morning star
When Jesus says
I am
He's saying it about this
This is who he is
What is that?
He's a diamond, baby
He's a diamond
Now do you understand why they said
He was casting out spirits by
Beelzebul
Oh, God
Did you know that was related to
Bacchus?
You didn't know that
Watch this, people
I'm going to do a trick
Boom
Give me that next one
Oh, look at this
Look at this at the bottom
Okay, here it is
I'm going to tell you this
You're going to know it
Satanic congregation
You're going to know it
Yeah
You're going to know it
And nobody else will
It's fulfillment
Of prophecy
I'm going to show you the seals
I'm going to show you the seals
Before I do
I'm going to show you a video
This is the video that we used
From Teddy Bass
And I want you to see
Just the story
That Chewie was able to put together
Fantastic
Chewie, why don't you hit that video
I'll be back
All the dreams
Washing the feet
With cloth
Underwear
Pedal in your spine
On wheels
Counter toxins
With healing waters
Welcome to the slaughter
Hail Satan
We're selling the books
To lies
Pendling the love drugs
With the kids
After dark
In the park
In the vampiric form
Gangster G
In the prostitutes
On adrenic chrome
Blood of the children
The language tree
Original sources
Jesus asks you don't scandalize him
The Vatican's poster boy
Main business was child sex trafficking

Dance with the news
Come with me
Point dependent ring
Elemental peas
They love the ca-ching-a-ling
Purple paint base
Down with the yellow brick road
Charlemagne sugar ring a-ling
This dream is in mind
It's yours
And I'm honored to be in it
Rock on Hail Satan
With a cup full of violet
Vagina juice
You know what to do
Briding out
With the stars in the sky
Pharmachea and the deer
Twinkle in your eye
The snake venom
Make some zombie like
Beautiful
Thank you, Teddy
Thank you, Chewie, for that
Lovely, lovely story
Look at the art people
That can be generated
By people who do not
Take your money
Isn't that fantastic?
Remember, everybody involved here
Right?
Lady Babylon, Armado
Is, well, I can't tell you Armado
Because I try not to curse
While I'm talking to you
But it's blank money, right?
Look, I did want to say this from before
I was watching a very popular YouTuber
Giving discussion and topic
About the very same kind of things
That you and I are interested in
And I had to get through 12 commercials
Seems like he was playing about
Once every minute and a half
And I thought after about 15 minutes
15 minutes to that, I thought
How much can you lend your backside
To someone before you say
Hey, something's going to get ripped
Yeah, yeah, greed
Stains the soul with a stench of ruin
Love it, that's why we are
Not monetized
Yes, and are keeping that
Tell, I can't take any contractually
Devil, you know, he'll
Some codices or something
Will kick in in the contract
And the next thing, you know
I'll be fending myself off
Oh, my goodness
There's one person you don't mess with
Right?
You don't mess with Lucifer
Love it, he's always gonna out thank you
He did, he already out thought Yahoo
Right, Yahoo got mad and stomped off
And destroyed the garden
Right?
Lucifer was like, no
No, bro, you don't get it
Let's go to the next one
Let's go, there's
People are giving us their time
People back to the, back to the, look
Oh, yeah, so he sends his angel
Right, he says at the bottom
I am that morning star
Here he is, here he is
Go ahead, next one
Yeah, and what did he do?
Wait, we gotta get the, gotta get that one
Who else is the morning star?
By the way, who else?
Who else is he? Look at this
He's gonna bring us, oh this is what I promised
Ready? Sfragida
Sfragida
Ooh, it sounds, what is that?
What is that? He holds
The entire cosmos by that
Sfragida
Oh, God
For the sake of everything
What does the morning star do?
He has the Sfragida
What is it?
What is that? Let's go, go to the next one
Should have had it on the next one after that, boom
No, of course not
Sorry
Who's, how about, let's try that one
No, no, no
There, okay
Here, Sfragis
Sfragidos
Here it is, go, go, hit it
Hit the next one after this
Cause that's got the real, oh my God
How much definition is this thing?
Am I gonna have to read? Look at this
Open it up for just a minute
I'll try to stay on mark here
But I probably won't be able to
Look, look, look, look, everything
From a gem or a stone to an impression
From a signet ring
All that kind of stuff, take it down
Give me the next one, let's focus in
Focus in, watch once
Oh, look at this, look at number three
Does anybody see number three?
This is a tablet of lemony and medicinal earth
These are the things that Galen went to pick up
You know what I mean?
This is good stuff
These are drugs from the ancient world
Only these, reputedly
Are the top
Panacea
This thing will get you healthy
And keep you healthy
Oh, love it
Love it
We
Killed it, right?
We used it all
Can't find it anymore
Stupid people
Go, people
Tell the watchers they're right
What else is this thing?
The
Sfragida that he mentioned
What are they?
Medically
They're pastiles, right?
Does anybody know what that is?
Right?
Look, oh, you can take these
I've seen the kind
Some of them you can take
And you can put little
Ball of
Medi and you take it
And you put it on the fire
And then you breathe it in
Oh, God, you take the
Another one
You put it in a cup
And you dissolve it
And you drink that
It's part of the medicine
You people
Who are running around
Teaching and preaching
About the seals
Oh, these are the seals
That they're going to break on the book
No
No
No, it's a medical application
Why do you think they're
Why do you think they got the devil
And the false prophet and the giant
Pit full of the smoke
Of purification
People
Come on
Yeah
All you got to do is follow the drugs
Watch what they're doing with the drugs
Go to the next one
Love it, let's try that
Look, people, this is too many
People are going to be like, dude
That long? I got to go
Look, and they shouted
A big voice saying
Look, the salvation
Right, sitting on our throne
Right, our God, oh, love it
Sitting on our throne
What's that last word? Arnio
And on the what?
On the
Arnio
That's a fleece
That's a fleece that you write
On
It's a very protected one
The dragon guards
Wait a minute, did you
I forgot, you were thanking
Lamb
Right
You were thanking Lamb
This is the Lamb of God
And he's next to the
He's next to God and they're on the throne
That's the happy ending
That's decrepit
Seriously?
Let the great mother just rinse
Pull out, you know what I mean?
Oh my God, what's that fleece?
You've got to have the song
Or
You can't have the mystery
You've got to have the song
Don't you understand
Now why they were fumigating themselves?
We saw it in the Mithraic liturgy
We saw it
Why they're fumigating themselves
With the song
They're breathing that stuff in
And they're listening to the chorus
Oh God
Those priestesses, man
Oh God, they set up a world
They just, oh
It's got to come back
We need this healing
You know what I mean?
Next one, please
That's fine
Just in case you think I'm full of it
Look at number two
Fleece
Go to the next one
Immediately, love it
So there is the fleece again
Right? On that middle of the throne
And it
Is what is causing us
To have access
To the waters of life
Right?
Those of you in Satanic congregation
Who know what it means to be born again
Will understand this
Right? They have
The water of life
Remember Jesus
When he's at the well
Right? And he's like, hey
You know what?
Be word
Get me some water
And she's like, why don't you suck it
Right? And he's like
Bang
I got it right here for you
I got your, if you'd asked me
I'd have given you the water of life
And she's like, no, no you can't
He's like, I know you
I know you
You're a lady of the evening
You like it
She was like, well
And from there
You have a group of people
Who will follow you around
And finance you
And set you up
Where you got a place
In downtown
Jerusalem
You know what Jesus had? This is the way
This is the way of Jerusalem
The holy city
You know what you get away with in the holy city?
You can get a room for the night
Fully staffed
With laid out goodies
Mmm
And you can have
You can take whoever you want
You can take a dozen boys up there
If you want
Yeah, you can
Oh my god
They caught him in the garden
It's a freaking cemetery
And he's out there
Covered with stuff
Right? Oh god
Okay
Next one please
Please, please, please, people are like
Sir, could you hurry?
Let's go. Here it is
And what happened? The smoke of this thing
Right?
What is the smoke of?
It's the smoke of the Thumia Maton
The
Aroma
Of the herbs
The spices
They prepare in these little bricks
To fumigate people
You stand around that temple and you're in a fog
Did you ever wonder what all the fascination
What fog is?
Yeah, oh god
The cop no bates and all these people
These are smokers, but not smokers
In the way that you and I think
You know, but smokers like, you know
We get 50 of us in a room
You know, we got a big barbecue pit
And we're burning stuff
Didn't you have a picture of something like that?
Chewie, I thought you did
They're burning or something
Yeah, anyway
That act
That act is really what's being featured here
And he says it's, you know
It's going up in those prayers
Right? Of those people
Who are entering into the ride
And who's giving it to us baby
It's the hand of an angel
Take it down, it's always the hand of an angel
And bring up some of that modern
Some of that modern goodery that you brought
Chewie
It's always in the hand of the angel
If you want your drug, right
You get it from the angel
Mary mother, Jesus did
It's where she got hers
Right?
Mary purple finger
Leave that one up for a little bit
Mary purple fingers
You didn't know they called this mother purple fingers, did you?
That's a name of a junkie
You mean Jesus Christ's mother
The virgin
The holy virgin
The virgin mother
She was a junkie
Yup
And she got her junk
From the angels in the temple
I didn't say that
They said that in antiquity
It's in one of the apocryphal
Things that the church was like
No, we can't let them know that
But the thing with historians
And classical philologists is
We don't care
It's your
It's our evidence that we
You know, we're entitled to our evidence
Yeah, that's ours
Belongs to us, we guard
Those texts
Let's let everybody have them
Oh, this stuff that's going to come out now
Of the library
This stuff that's going to come out of the Julian's library
Right?
The Julian family
Oh my god
You realize there
Direct descendants
Of Urania herself
Oh god
This is gorgeous
You're about to see some stuff
Look, I did get to tell you a little bit
It doesn't matter
Let's keep going, give me the source
Give me the source, that was just
You know, radiation
I think I'm getting
Boom, hit that one
Yeah, don't do the earth
And so, god
What's he going to do, people?
He's like, look
This is gangsta G
And yahoo
Somebody needs
To write this
Gangsta G
And yahoo, people are like
No, it's gangsta
Gangsta G
From Jesus
Right, get your stuff together
And what's
He going to do here? He's like
Look, rip it up, brah
Go down there and tear those people one
You know what I mean? I want to see blood
All the way up to the horses, baby
But first
I want you to seal my slaves
I
I want you to put
I want you to put something
I want you to write something
I want you to engrave
Something
On their foreheads
Oh, god, is this
Gangsta or what?
Right, these
You know, these
Divinities knew how to rock, baby
That's the stuff right there
It's too bad
Your religion, Christianity and Judaism
It's too bad your religions
Or religions of human sacrifice
That's terrible
You guys should stop doing that
Look
Yah, yah
The Greeks, they worked it
Out of the system
Right, that's off
That's off boundaries
When you kill
Human beings
To quench your thirst for blood
And
Resources and power
That
Is not classical civilization
Right, it's not classical civilization, brah
You don't kill children
Yah, I'm sorry
All you pro-lifers out there
Who are sacrificing
Children and have that blood
On your hands
Okay, I'm sorry
No, not really, I'm not
You're gonna wear that stain
You're gonna wear it
Go to the text, the next text
Don't tell me I'm scary
I'm coming into your dreams, baby
Give me the next one
Love it, oh, yah
Okay, yah, the impression
I just wanted to see the bottom
We were gonna talk about the phantasm
But I think we need to go on
Yah, I wanted to get into the
Aspects of all of this
When you go into the third heaven with these Christians
That's what you gotta do
Let's get all happy
Let's get all happy
Yah, right
Let's just, okay, party people
Glory, glory
We're gonna give him glory
We're gonna give the king glory
Why? Because what's coming?
Do you know what this is a reference to?
Yah, yah
This is a reference to a
Right that we have
In classical texts that predate
Christianity by hundreds of years
Yes
What is this?
Gamos
It's the gamos
That you call the marriage of the lamb
Which I always thought was a little bit perverted
I was like, what?
Never kind of made sense
Like, here's the bride, isn't she beautiful?
She's been washed and cleansed
Oh, she's
She has been cleansed in blood of her lord
And here she is, and here's the lord
Meh
Wait, what?
Is that thing gonna marry that beautiful bride?
That is disgusting, bro
Who thought of this stuff?
Right?
No, it's because it's mistranslated
Right?
They're talking about that fleece
That holds the song
That causes the
Right of
Death and resurrection
To work
Oh, nice
Nice, you mean
You can use this song to replicate the right
Yes
You can't do it without it
Turns out the song is everything
Fantastic
Fantastic
There is a marriage
Ceremony
That takes place
On
That fleece
Yeah
Yeah, isn't that nice?
Didn't you wonder why there was a marriage thing?
Right? You're like
God and his son and his son's wife
Who else is in that family?
Wait
Father and son
And there's a holy ghost out here too
Right? But still, he's like a cousin or something
Right? Where's the mom?
And
Didn't he have any sisters?
Wow, well, it turns out he does
Turns out a third of them
Ended up
The Mormons will love this
Ended up in the right place
Serving the right king
Why wouldn't you?
We hate liars, dude
Right? Everybody
In the Satanic congregation
For those of you who have taken my Greek course
And I wanted to say
My great courses are coming
Fantastic. I've got some killer students
At all levels
And I'm totally pleased
With that
And I just want to say
What a privilege it is
To be able to work with you in Dojo
To get you up to speed
So that you can get out there
And you can do your own work
And you can forge ahead in the frontier
I just want to say it's great
It's a credit to humanity
And it's a gift
That I am able to work with you
So, thank you
Everyone who's working diligently in the Dojo
Love it. Let's go to the next source
I was going to say a few things
But don't want to get sappy
Let's get all happy
Right? We did that one
Oh, yeah
Notice the woman that's involved in this
Mm-hmm, yeah
Right?
Just wait
There's the lamb. Keep going. We don't need him anymore
Throw him away
Here we go. Oh, yeah, it's a prayer
Don't worry. Give me the next text
We're almost finished, people
We're almost finished. And
What is special about our Lord Jesus Christ?
Besides the fact
In the apocalypse
That he is wearing
Women's lingerie
What is the
What is the special thing about him?
Which, look
If you haven't been there
Right? If somebody wanted to portray
Jesus today
And they wanted to get him
Within the apocalypse
They're going to have to bring him the garb of the
Morningstar, which it says
That he's wearing. Let's take a look
At him. He's got a flocks puros
In his othaumoi
He's got what? Yeah
He's been Christed, you boneheads
Right?
Did we
All arrive late? No, Satanic
Congregation is sitting there and like
Yep, we get it. I see some
Of you make comments in the comments, by the way
And you're like, hey, wake up
Go watch the performers
Don't ask questions like that
That's two seasons ago
Right? I love that
And it's really for you people
That I should be most dedicated
Yeah, it should
I'm sorry if it feels like
Sometime that I'm bringing in
The old
It's because they're always
New people who are going to be watching
And they need to
They need to be welcomed
We're going to sacrifice them later
Yeah
Let's go to the next one
Please, please, before
This gets too sappy
He's got the flocks puros in his eyes
That's why he's there
People are like, wait, what is this?
He's got like laser beams
You know, if he's got like fire
Coming out of his eyes
And you get pictures of this
How are you going to depict this?
Right? How are you going to depict it?
It turns out it's the drugs
And they're just using
Technical terms for his Christing
That's what the Morningstar is
He's been Christed
Right? And he
I'm sorry if I misgender
I should have said she there
Yeah, because remember
Ooh
Right? Hey
Stop showing
Those pictures of those earliest statues
Of Aphrodite
Right? You gotta stop showing those
Pretty soon there's going to be a mob
There's going to be a mob
Of evangelicals whacking off the
Penises that are on all the old
Aphrodite statues
Yeah, well, you know
What? You didn't consider that?
Seriously?
Yeah
And you think you understand Jesus
Who's the Morningstar?
The Morningstar is Venus
Yeah
Welcome to the Julian Library
People
Oh god, I love it
Here we got two more and that's it
Because these people, they have hung in there
I gotta get into that climax and let's go
Look, yeah
All of you who wash
Your clothing
Make it all nice and clean
Right? All of you
You're the ones who have that
Authority
You have that right to be in there
With the tree of life
Yeah
You're the ones
You're the ones, does anybody
Smell Eve
Does anybody smell
Ewa
Does anybody smell her hair?
That's who Zoe is
Right? In our oldest text
Which is the
What you call the Old Testament
Which is the Septuagint
That's what she's called
Her name is Zoe
Isn't that beautiful? Her name is life
And here she comes in the end
You know, you're gonna have to have her
If you're gonna have that gamos
Because otherwise you're nothing, Jack
You are nothing
Your life is not complete
Isn't that amazing?
And that's what the right
Will teach you
You know how many misogynists were
Orphics?
Zero
Imagine, if you could have a religion
Completely devoid of
Misogyny
Right?
If you could put somebody
Through a process where they could
Be born again
Their mind could be opened
And not be misogynists
Isn't that funny?
One of the things that you cure
When you cure disease
Of the psyche
Is misogyny
Interesting
Interesting. You mean the Greeks
Would say the most diseased
Are those atheist
Christians
Yeah, they would
Those sibling, atheist Christians
They're the ones who bring
That pollution
And let it fester
That's what they would say
Psychically. I mean, take it for what you want
You know, it's a bunch of dead people
Right?
Take that for what you want
They're gonna overthrow
They're gonna overthrow your democracy
Wait, what? Who said that?
Julie and the apostate? Where are you?
He's hiding somewhere in here
I knew he would be
Children, right? We need a children's show
That's what we need
Whoever wants to volunteer to be Barney
Let me know. You come in here
I'll give you. I'm joking
Down, please, please
No
No, give me the last
Give me the second. Good
And I just wanted to end with this
Because we saw at the very beginning
Of this journey
That today
And I'm gonna get to your comments
Because I want to do a little back
And forth with your comments
See how people are doing
Because it's nice. We can do that. It's live
Right?
I want to
Punctuate
This talk tonight by saying
Look, we started with
Somebody saying
Who had access to sources
Saying, look, the history
The historians of the Greeks themselves
Who are writing their own histories
They're saying
That
They as a culture emerged
From
What you and I would call
Trafficking
Trafficking
Yeah
So
Yeah
Think about that for a minute. Love it
Jesus is sitting there
And he says what? Jesus says
Look
Come out against me
Like I'm some kind of trafficker
Like I'm some kind of trafficker
The reality
Is
That you are
Right out of your son of god
Mouth
And you think through the fairy tale
The son of god is the descendant
Holy Jesus
Virgin breath
And they're a little bit
Right? And there it comes
Wait, what?
That's what you think
Because you are a sucker
For fairy tales
You love them
That's not the anthropology, bro
They call them sons of god
Because they were so high
They could conceive
Of things they normally couldn't
They could see things
They could go places
Travel, you hear?
Do you hear them talking like that?
Jesus was the biggest drug user on the planet
Thanks to Jesus
Like I'll let you take this poison
Oh god, it won't kill you
I'll show you, you want the water of life
I'll show you
I'll show you, I got your water of life
It's a sad
I'm sorry for you
Christians out there
Because you haven't been a part
Of this process
I am sorry
That your duping
Was so incredible
But hey
Look at it this way
You can stop now
Right? You can live part of your life
Without
Um
Putting a pedo
Into a position of somebody
That you know is your master
And lord
You can walk away from that
And they recognize that
They recognize that spell
Can be broken, that Christian spell
It's the same thing, it's Taliban
It's the same thing, the Orthodox
Who want that blood
It's the same thing
Those child sacrifices
Yeah
Yeah
Let us pray
Somewhere that is
Outside
Of the capital
And let that
Democracy
Let that democracy thrive
You know who would say that?
Athena
A woman goddess
A woman goddess
For my
20% female audience
Right?
For my 20% female audience
Yeah
Yeah
She was worshiped and we got democracy
Thank you, Athena
Let's look at a couple of comments
And then we're gonna
We're going to
Give you the teddy to roll us out
I love it, the rest of the song is
Awesome
Let's see
There's always time to change the
Here, let's put
No, okay
Sorry, it looks like
No
No, take a trip without leaving
Your seat, yeah, put that up
That's intelligent, is that intelligent?
Take a trip without leaving
Your seat
That guy's a wizard, maybe it's a witch
I don't know
Here, put that one up
Yeah, go ahead
I know it's small, no, not that one
This one
Bingo
I love that
Did somebody win?
What do I get? What's my prize?
Let's go
Do they roll bingo while we're doing
I didn't know the Falcon had space for bingo
I love it though
Keep it out
Look at that one, put Carrie's up there
Here's Carrie Ann Chrysler
Oh, Carrie's been here from the beginning
Right, Carrie, I'm sorry if you pronounce it
Carrie, I don't know
You should tell me
And so what is it?
Yeah, so a chaos
Control, chaos and control
Definitely
Definitely, right
Look at the very way the mystery is set up
It's meant to
Put you into a place
And pull you back out of it
That you can have some kind of
Awakening, a new perspective
On the universe, yeah, that is
That's good stuff, man
Talk about it, it's both chaos and control
We can jump
To Wonderland anytime
Yeah, can you?
Don't be like that
I think, I don't know
It makes me want to go too
I'll go with you, wait
Let's go, but you got to be with Alice
Or I'm totally not interested
Because, you know
Aneus, right, remember Aneus
With the civil ride
I mean
If you aren't sitting with the muse
What the hell are you doing, right?
Seriously, you thought your life
Would be fulfilled in your husband
Or your wife, or your children
Or your next door neighbors
Pensioned for
Sitting around smoking cigars
No, no
None of that stuff is fulfilling
Right, it is that
Muse alone
Isn't she gorgeous?
Oh god, yeah
Singer of the universe
Love it
Oh, you didn't know the universe
Was being sung?
Oh, man
I should have cheered
Did I leave that out?
I left that out
The universe
As you experience it
Is a song
Yeah, with a singer
Love it
Love it, what else is life?
What else can be?
Love the Gandhi
Okay, so you think
They'll overthrow democracy again
Or is that yahoo going to be castrated?
Who is
Serpent spit?
That's fantastic
Great question
Is yahoo going to get castrated?
Yeah
Yeah
If
Athena
Can be born
From yahoo's brain
We can preserve democracy
But
It doesn't look good
When your
Justice
Is no longer there
Right, first thing you gotta do
Is you gotta have justice
Let the sacrifices, right
You're allowed
To sacrifice the tyrant
Who attempts to overthrow the government
That's historical
That's part of our American
Spirit
I feel like Thomas Jefferson
Baby
Let's get it on
Right
Oh, God
What did Ben say?
He said something about any religion
That had to be
Yoke itself to the government
Was not one worth following
It's a virus
It's a virus
And it'll kill your democracy
This isn't the first time
Right
Yeah, fantastic
It's dangerous, so on behalf of
Athena, why do I say that?
People say, oh, I don't care
About your politics, shut up
I don't care about your politics
This isn't politics
This is the worship of the gods
And I'm pretty darn thankful
That I've got
A democracy
I'm pretty thankful of the enlightenment
That that has been able
To foster
And I know
When I face my ancestors
There's gonna be questions
That I fight to preserve
What they created
For us
By Athena, man
I wanna be sitting there with her
Right, I wanna be on that side
So
What's the future?
What's the future?
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Love it, who said this one?
Wait, okay
I, for one, am glad I don't
Gotta worry about stealing my kids
And selling them into sex trafficking
Thanks, Christianity
Yes, no
It's a good thing
Who would want to do that anyway, right?
That's what all those songs
Of mourning are about
That's what all those songs
Of mourning are about
Because it's the parents
Who have lost their children
Because the band
The band of traffickers
Came up and took them
It's terrible
Terrible, don't think
I was talking with somebody about Jesus
And the fact that
Loving Jesus
Is, you know
People can do it and
Don't worry, it's not bad
Dude, you're loving a pedophile
Jesus Christ
Is a drug-using
Child-abusing
Pito
Who had a band
Of prostitute boys
And if you knew
What he did with them
Through that little window that we have
Of seeing him arrested
By the way
You don't have any evidence
Mark
1451 and 52
Sorry, satanic congregation
Already has that stuff memorized
They don't need that
Look it up, I feel like you guys know
Look it up, okay
Go to the next one, let's see
Put that one up there
I agree, he, he, he
Was that a gender thing
Or was that a
I'm just kidding
I say fantastic
What are you doing
What is that, I say fantastic
Fantastic, love it
No
What's that
This is a kind of comment
People need to send
This kind of comment more often
Seriously, right
Oh, oh, Dr.
Yes
Does this sound like
Oh
Um
No
Down
You
Fierce, it's just the mojo
It'll go away in a minute
I'm reaching out to you
Remember how the preachers
Reach out to you like
I'm reaching out to you
Oh, I can feel it, can you feel it
Oh, put that thing up there
That abomination
Yeah
Put that, hang on
Hang on, give me a second
Oh
Yes, no, pretend like you didn't see that
You go, oh, just
Flash it quick so they have to stop it and bring it back
No, take it down, okay
What was that
That didn't get my goat, did it
Bring her up and then
We're gonna head out for the evening
Look, bring her up, where'd she go
Bring her up, fantastic
Look, oh god
Curse on thee
Curse on thee
Very fact that you look there
Very bad
Okay
Thank you, Apollo
Who is Pan
Thank you very much, if you
Read that hymn, you'll find that
Yeah, yeah
Oh, love it
Love it, thank you for coming tonight
Thank you for coming
Everybody out there
I love you, man, I love you
It's just fantastic to
Be able to spend this time with you
And to be able to commune like this
I truly am thankful
And we'll meet up, we'll meet up
On the other side
And we'll have more time
We'll have more time together, I love it
I'm gonna play you out tonight
With a little more Teddy
Who is our Orpheus
Hail Satan
See you next time
It's elusive
Hail Satan
It's in the air tonight
But so long
St. Peter's Palm
So carry on
For those who have eyes to see
Aphrodisia
St. Peter's Palm
