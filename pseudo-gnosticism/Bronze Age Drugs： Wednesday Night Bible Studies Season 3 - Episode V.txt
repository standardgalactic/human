I never meant anything I said Just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin' To keep it from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant I never said the letters that I should've said
But so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows When I say, never was a cause for a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon Wednesday Night Bible Study
Tonight we're gonna be lookin' at Mycenaean Drug Users
This is fantastic
We're just being bombarded
We're being bombarded by all this good evidence
All this hardcore archeology
Oh god, throw some science in there
Next thing you know
HPLC
Oh god, we're gettin' the samples tonight
We're gonna look at some couple of things
About Bronze Age Drug Users
And we're going to look at a very frustrated person through time
And we're going to watch the world develop a sense from that evidence
Despite his greatest, highest, loudest voice
We're gonna have a little clip tonight
Gorgeous little clip
A chance for us to hear some of the music of Zang Campbell
Definitely demon-possessed
Definitely
Certifiably, love it
And then we're gonna talk about some current events in archeology
And a little bit of pharmacology
And we're gonna start off with a little bit of Medea
So you can see who she is
I hope you were not too disappointed that Neil has become a little bit not feeling so well
And won't be able to make it tonight
We thank him for putting out the effort
Appreciate that, Neil
Hope you feel better
So tonight, whereas I was thinking about a conversation between me and Neil
It's gonna end up having to be a conversation between me and an invisible devil
So I want to start out with a couple of quotes
I'm gonna take you, gonna get in the ship
We're gonna go back in time
We're gonna land somewhere of 1200, 1100 BC
Talking near the end of the Bronze Age
We're gonna talk about one of these drug users
One of these drug users
Chewie hit the first slide with
I just want to read this to you
This is from the Orphic Argonautica
We start at the end here
At one of the gate posts there stood a statue of the far-seeing queen
Scattering with her motion the radiance of fire
Whom the caulkians propitiate as Artemis of the gate
Resounding with a chase
Terrible for men to see and terrible to hear
Unless one approaches the sacred rites and purification
The rites kept hidden by the priestess who was initiated
Medea, unfortunate in marriage
Along with the girls of Sita
No mortal, whether native or stranger, entered that way
Crossing over that threshold
For the terrible goddess kept them away by all means
Breathing madness into her fired-eyed dogs
I want you to make sure that you're getting an impression of
The time
Remember we're talking about priestesses here
And we're talking about a Medea
Who's the queen
And she is the one who is exercised in the right
Only she can do it
Right?
Her Citean maids
Are these exceptionally skilled
Workers in drugs
Scythian archeresses
Yeah, from across
From across the way
On the Black Sea
And these are very skilled, talented people
I wanted you to see that
I wanted you to see that she's named as that person
You can't approach this divinity, Artemis
You can't approach her unless you go by the way of the rites
Yeah, by the way of the rites
Now, I have been screaming at people about drug use
In the Bronze Age
And we've all been sitting here for the last four or five months
And we have seen that
There was drug use
Yes, there was drug use
Not just in antiquity, classical antiquity
But preceding that considerably
Yeah, drug use
And people tend not to pay attention
Well, now they're paying attention
And now we want to know
And it's funny to watch them
You can watch the evolution of the scholars here
As they go through the machinations
Of trying to set their mind outside of the paradigm
That they thought was reality
And now they have to go into another
So good for them
Good for them
It's a great experience
Thank you guys for doing that HPLC and whatnot
Yeah, fantastic
Second quote by Medea
I just want you to see, or about Medea
I just want you to see
The dream quickly struck terrible fear
In the heart of the king
He seemed to see on the lovely bosom
Of the young maiden Medea
Whom he was raising in his halls
A glistening star darting across its heavenly path
Which she, having taken it up on her robe
Brought to water of the fair-flowing fossus
He saw the star seize the maiden
And carry her across the black sea
This is the vision of E.T.'s
And that was more of the Orphic Argonautica
And this vision is preserved in multiple sources
And so we ask ourselves
In the first quote from the Argonautica
Who are the dogs?
You can't get in to see the secret
Unless you get by the dogs
But she gives those dogs maddening poison
Right? She gives them maddening poison
Remember that
Maddening poison
Remember that we're talking about the Ioboloa
The hurlers of the poison
This is Artemis Iocchiara
This is Artemis who pours out the poison
Who pours out the communion venom
This is her
And you can't get there
You can't even get across the threshold
Right? Unless you've been through the mystery
You cannot get there
They call these the ahidni
The ahidni
Because they are priestesses
Who have been using the formula
Who have been using the toxins to alter themselves
Right? They're the Medusa
Now, I wanted you to see a little bit more of Medea
And what's going on
Maybe you have a little more respect for the knowledge
Because now the brides, you know
The scholars are always, they're always right there
I love it
You guys, you do it tremendously
A tremendously mediocre
And sometimes late job
You know, and sometimes even damaging
By giving us garbage
We don't want any garbage theories
We just want the evidence
Right? And everybody knows
The evidence now says from the hair samples that we've got
That the bronze age was full of drug use
Yes, yes, that there are drugs in people
Hallucinogens
And not necessarily hallucinogens that you want to
You know, go out and see a concert with
Right? Right?
So, yeah, this is serious stuff
Let's take a look at it
I want, before we do
I want to watch a little clip
Just two
Number one, to do two things
Number one, to remind you that we've been talking about these people
Using drugs for the last six months
And number two, to set your mind in that place
Where you can say, okay
How are these scholars looking at this evidence?
What are they doing with it?
Yeah, love it
Let's hit the clip, please
Oh, I could blame it on her
Or on him, or on them
But in the end, I made my own little help
And they wonder why
I turned to the wine
I turned to the wine
Every time I did lonely
I turned to the wine
Every time that I do
I turned to the wine
And the wine turns on me
And the blues turn a darker blue
I hope that set the mood a little bit there
Because we're going to be talking about how we got there
So this, as you know, the story's blowing up, right?
The story's blowing up
It's all everywhere from the New York Times
It's all over journals
I'm going to splash some of these up here
You guys have seen this
You guys have seen this
Here we go, here's Salon, Bronze Age Europeans
We're getting high on all kinds of drugs
Hair analysis study finds
Wow, that's fantastic
How about another one?
Here's one from CNN, my goodness
Look at that, that's central
3,000-year-old hairs hold the oldest clues
About psychoactive drug use in Europe
Fantastic
Here's one from the Greek reporter
Scientists discover evidence of drug use
During Bronze Age rituals
Okay, it's getting deeper, right?
We're getting in there
Tripping in the Bronze Age
Says the New York Times, right?
Love it
We're going to look at a couple of these in depth
This one, I think, is gross
I don't know why, but whatever that is
I know it's no offense to the Bronze Age dude
Or dude that who was wearing that
But I don't know
It makes my stomach turn a little bit
Direct evidence of ancient Bronze Age drug use
Found in Menorca, right?
So this is all off that Spanish island
Find that they've got with hair
And what they're looking at it
And I just wanted you to see a couple of quotes, right?
Direct evidence of the use of multiple drugs
In Bronze Age Menorca
One from Human Hair Analysis
Beautiful, beautiful
Archaeology, evidence of drug use
During Bronze Age ceremonies
Bronze Age ceremonies, they say
Bronze Age ceremonies, okay
Let's keep going
Here's a direct quote
The findings published Thursday
In scientific reports of the journal Nature
Great journal
Provide the first direct evidence
Consumed psychoactive drugs
Much like their pre-Columbian brethren
In Mesoamerica, the researchers said
Wait a minute
Did he say brethren?
What was that?
I need that quote back
Here, there we go
Yeah, brethren, okay
They weren't really brothers, right?
I don't know where, you know, they're not even
Mostly related, right?
But, okay, who knows?
That's a nice ambiance
He's trying to create there, right?
Yeah, this is, he says
The first direct evidence
That ancient Europeans
Now, when he's saying ancient Europeans
He's talking Bronze Age, right?
And this is my frustration
If the classicists were on the ball
And I'll just throw it out there
This is not the first evidence
That we have of ancient drug use
Several of these articles say that
This, we finally have evidence
For ancient drug use
Take a step back, poindexter
Put down that slide rule
Put it down, put it down
The words that you're using
To describe all of these drugs
They're already talking about in detail
And we'll see this as the, right?
Apparently, this is amazed, but here's the problem
Classists don't like to go there
Because classes, and you can ask him
Ask him all, ask Bart Erman, right?
Because people watch him here
Not because he's a classist, he's not a classist
But, you know, ask Carl Rock, right?
This stuff has been sitting in this literature
For a ton of time
And nobody reads it
Thousands of pages on drugs
I can even tell you what was on that hair
Yeah, I'm gonna show you
You're gonna, the benefit of coming tonight
Was that you get to be one step ahead
Of the rest of the world
One step, just one
Let's do it, let's do it
Yeah, here's the main doc
Who's ahead of it, right?
I'm not quite sure, I'm sorry
At least if I've mispronounced your name
The lead author of the study said
Researchers were stunned by the results
Now, wait a minute, nobody's stunned, guys
Just wait, especially because the cane interiors
Yielded no tangible signs of drugs presence
Myself, okay, well, they didn't
They had it in their hair
But not in their pockets
Okay, fine
A chemical analysis of the hair revealed
Evidence of three alkaloid substances
What are those alkaloids?
Those are those nitrogenous substances
That have some kind of physiological activity
Yeah, human body, they can be antifungal
They can be painkillers, you know
You're not gonna get to chase the dragon
Without alkaloids, right?
Alkaloids, nice family of chemicals
Yeah, known to produce altered states of consciousness
What they find, ephedrine, atropine, and scopolamine
And for those of you who are, you know
Just somewhere on the periphery, neuroscience
You might be a neuroscientist
You might be some molecular biologist
You know, maybe chemist
Maybe an engineer, right?
And you might be familiar with some of this terminology
You know that these substances are not
These are not lightweights, right?
Atropine and scopolamine
That will put you into a vision state
That the magic I use to torture people to get information out of them, right?
Yeah, that's what these people had in their hair
That's what they had in their hair
And they say, we're stymied
We're surprised at this, I don't know why they're surprised
Yeah, especially when the Greeks are documenting all of this
And you say to yourself, oh, give us the evidence
We're hungry, I want that evidence
I want your evidence
Give me that evidence
I'll give you my evidence
Just all you gotta do is go back to Homer
I was talking with Neil today
And Neil said he interviewed a PhD
And the PhD got his PhD in New Testament studies, right?
And then he went back and got a master's degree in classics
And he said he didn't realize how full of nothing was the Bible studies degree
Isn't that funny?
Because he went back and got a classics degree
They brought him up to the evidence
And I know you're hungry for that
My audience is hungry for that evidence
Give me the evidence
I got Homer
Let's call up Homer
And you say, wait a minute, where are we?
Don't worry
It's 9th or 8th century
B.C.
9th or 8th century
Yeah
We're only a couple of centuries away from that
Ending of that Bronze Age
We're talking about the same generations
Homer is harkening back to this Bronze Age
And he is saying in it
They're on drugs
What do you mean this is the first evidence we've ever had?
What are you talking about?
Go to the tax
Oh my God
You can't have a party
In the Bronze Age without getting there on drugs
And that's what the scholars are so worried about
They're trying to make sure
I'm going to show you these quotes
They want you to know
They want you to know this is not for fun
This is not for fun
No
I want to take you out back
I got a place for you out back
Come on, let's go
It's okay
Services are over
Come on
Come on
We got to take off the uniforms anyway
You know what I mean?
They want to take you out back
Homer is talking about the drugs
You have a giant party where you have people over
You douse them in drugs
Drug-laced wine
That gets them so bent
That he says you could kill their mother or father in front of them
And they wouldn't care
Now, vice news
Thanks for the bid on the scorpion smoking
Get out there and look at that
If you guys haven't seen that
The place that takes you
Is a place that they're going backwards
Back and forth to
To enter these places where you can interact with
The powers that be
Real sorcery
Real sorcery
I love it
Let's keep going
Which one am I on?
The author suggests in the presence of these alcohol
It may have been due to consumption of some nightshade plants
Such as Mandrake
Now look
I want you to notice as we're reading these
These are all of the suspects
The usual suspects
You could look in any
Inquisition documentation
You can watch the trials
You can see what kind of testimony you can get out of them
These are the drugs
The standard list of drugs
They are always catching the witches with
Always catching them with
What do we get here?
Mandrake
They also use Mandrake, by the way, in surgery
In antiquity
Cool, huh?
Henbane
Highest sky on this
That's what they call it in Greek
Name
For all you people who are surprised
All of you scholars
I'll give you credit
You guys are out there digging in the dirt
And you're getting the evidence
Who are?
I love that
But look here
The Greek name for the drug you found
Is sitting right in front of our faces
Highest sky on this, right?
That's all you gotta know
Did they know about these drugs?
Yeah, did they use them?
Of course they did
And they wrote a ton about using them
That nobody shame on the classics out there
One more time
As a Ronan
I wanna say this
Today is my last
I want the world to know
That the people in classics
Have let you down
That they are dogs
That they are not the guardians
Of those sacred words
That they have lost their right
To call themselves
Defenders of the muse
Shame on you people
There's literally thousands of stuff
That remains untranslated
Cause like my dissertation
Like the head of my department told me
When I was giving my dissertation
She said
The Romans
They just wouldn't do such a thing
I was like
Are we talking about the same people?
Are we talking about the same people?
Have you seen what the Romans do?
Yeah
Okay, let's keep going
Cause I wanna get to Jesus
I wanna get to stabbing Jesus
We're gonna get there
This one
Yeah, here we go
Hang on, no, I'm gonna read this one
Henbane and thorn apple
Right?
What else?
Joint pine?
The author suggests that these drug plants
May have been used as part of ritual ceremonies
Performed by Shaman
Right?
No, it's still all run to that
Right?
Now, we're getting outside the evidence
Right?
And what do they use for evidence?
The concentric circles and the wooden containers
May have depicted eyes
Okay, personally, people
That's it
In my scientific opinion
Having worked in a lab myself
That doesn't hold up
Come on, guys
You can do that
That's the best you scholars can do
I'm sure there are people right now
Who are writing a book
Probably for Rutledge
And I'll bet you can look at all these pots
And they'll say
This is the psychedelic experience
No, you can't make conclusions like that
Then it's not how you use evidence
I wouldn't hold up in a court
You think they would convict someone on a murder charge?
Based on the big googly eyes and the pots?
Yeah, your people grow up
Why don't you just read your texts?
Why don't you just read what the people that came after them
Said to do with the drugs?
I don't know
Maybe that's an idea
Helen is putting drugs in the wine
Cersei is drugging men
She's got the dildo rod
She is drugging men, man
This is an operation
This is big stuff
These are crazy poisons
Right, love it
This stuff will get you going
And people are shocked
Oh, we found hair
We found Bronze Age hair
And in this hair we found drugs
Do you know how frustrating it is?
Step back for a minute
Step back for a minute
I have been shouting to the world
I've been shouting to the world
Carl Rock has been shouting to the world
His whole career
And people look at you funny
Now you've got hair
You morons
Now you've got hair
And now you see it's there
Yeah, finally
You don't deserve it
You don't deserve to know what the Caesars were doing
You don't deserve in the cult
You despicable
Athenian women weren't staying indoors all the time
Shame on you
Shame on you
You pretend to write a book
It's disgusting
Open up the pharmaceutical stuff
Let's see where it goes
You'll have to forgive me
Clear distaste for academia
But I was known for that
As a graduate student too
And I would always bring that
They were like, oh, Hillman's here
He's gonna bring up something nobody knows
Read the tax people, it's all there
Let's keep going
This is exciting
The researchers noted that
The dangerous nature of the alkaloids
Found in the hair
Using and handling these substances
Required specialized knowledge and expertise
What a bunch of geniuses you guys are
Yeah, congratulations
Congratulations, if you'd read the documents
They talk about what specialists you have to have
Just to procure these drugs
Much less to make the compounds
And what to do with them
Some of this stuff is great
This is a, you know
And remember, Bronze Age
The glory time
That's when these big cities are getting built
That's when what you and I call civilization
That's when it's thriving
It's only afterwards with the dark age
They don't know what happened
It's an island blew up
And people invaded
And, you know, famine
And all that kind of stuff
They don't know what caused that
But we went backwards
We know that the people that were associated
Just think on this for a minute
The people that were associated with the advancements
Were the ones who were actively performing the mystery
Whereby they were exposed to the drugs
Yeah, I love it
Let's go on, next quote
Where are we?
Julie, get us here
Good
Drug use among humans
Is a practice known to be thousands of years old
Based on clues that were previously uncovered
In Eurasia and the Americas
But in Europe, the presence of mind-altering plants
At prehistoric sites offered archaeologists
An incomplete picture until now
They lacked evidence that people in ancient communities
Ingested the plants
Oh, by the way, it didn't ingest them all
There's a lot of where they eat this stuff
Medea invented the vapor bath, they call it
The vapor bath
You ask yourself, what's a vapor bath?
Remember, she's surrounded by civilian women
These women bathed themselves
As our textiles, Herodotus
With the fumigation
They have oils they put on their skin
Made out of woods
Very nice, great descriptions of this stuff
Beautiful, beautiful
There's some real, real chemistry
Right there from the beginning with all of this
Bring that up again
With these new findings
Representing the earliest evidence of drug consumption
Medea invents the vapor bath
Which you would think is like a steam bath
But it's just the exposure to the smoke of something
Isn't that neat?
It's like a fumigation
That later is called a fumigation
Nice
Apparently, she's the one who invented this
We have that attributed to her
Isn't that nice?
You can enter
When you enter into the tabernacle
I had one person tell me this week
Stop, my worldview is shatters
I don't want to keep going down this path
When you got that person who steps into the tent
The curtains that hold in all that vapor
And they're talking to God
This is pre-Moses
We're talking, Moses is coming from these traditions
They're talking about Mycenaean stuff
They're talking about 1600
Moses is later
That's why he's throwing around his serpent
People think of Charlton Heston
And that people watched Easter
The other guy with the big beard
And they hold him up
They don't realize that
That dude was throwing snakes around
He's performing magic
He built a tent
And you can go inside that tent
And you can talk to God
You will hear the voice of God
Don't worry
We're going to tie a rope to your leg
Because if you pass out, we'll drag you out
That's vapor, dude
This is Bronze Age technology
Let's go to the next quote
That they're harnessing here
These findings are so singular, said
The doc in charge
Sometimes when people think about drugs
They think it's a modern practice
These results tell us a different story
There's also those of us who
When they hear about drugs
No, it's an ancient practice
It doesn't bother us
We wouldn't be surprised
According to the study
The fluoronative to Menorca includes
The psychoactive species
Deterra, Hyoschymus, and Mandragora
Which contain the tropane derivatives
Atropine and Scopolamine
Also on the island is Ephedra
Which contains the phenylatholamine
Derivative, Ephedra, and Popoverisomniferum
Yay for the opium
This is quite a cocktail we're ending up with here
Isn't it? This is wonderful
Which has its own alkaloids
Morphene, which we all know
Everybody, big hand for morphene
Long, long, long, long history
Turns out your ancestors were
Shipping opium all over the world
Long time ago, way before they
Invited democracy, way before they did
Killing pain is killing pain, bro
The Bronze Age populations of Menorca
May have employed drug plants
For their medicinal properties
Thanks, genius
However, the high levels of toxicity
Found in the hair samples
Suggest the plant drugs were also used
For the hallucinogenic properties
In shamanic ceremonies, right?
So in shamanic ceremonies
Guess, guess, guess
Was that written in the cave?
That wasn't written in the cave
All you found is some people with drugs
Considering the potential toxicity
Of the alkaloids found in the hair
Their handling use in applications
Represent highly specialized knowledge
The author's report
Yeah, I wonder where they pass that on to
Yeah, mm
Going back to the shamans
What is wrong with you people?
Don't you know that when people think of shaman
Do you know what they think of?
Yeah, they don't think of
The queen of Colchis
Who created the Meads
Right? They don't know
They don't...
Shaman
She wasn't a shaman
She was a witch queen
Moron
Who knew the mystery
Yeah
Who dispensed
The poison of the Kidna
Love it, from her dark harbor
You get that one, you classicist
Did that fracture
Your brain
Your dark harbor
Is your vagina
When it's covered with the burning purple
Yeah
Yeah
Did we get censored on that or something?
Chewie, hang on Chewie
Did we just hit an asteroid or something?
What was that?
Wow, okay, I gotta...
Oh, are we...
We're overheating, hang on
It's too much, I start talking about...
Yeah, about the pudinda
We'll say it politely and scientifically
The pudinda finisciana
The purple harbor
That's where all sailors go
The ones who sail into the ion
That's where they go
Okay, let's keep going
These people are getting creepy
Plants like henbane and belladonna
Produce atropin and scopolamine
But the plant that these Bronze Age people
Were most likely eating
Was thorn apple, also known as gymsenweed
It has distinct spiky seed pods
And muted lavender flowers
Okay, nice, nice, nice
But what does it do? Look
Reportedly some potent often nightmarish trips
That's where you want to get
When you get here
Some of these reports talk about
What's the use of these?
It's gotta be sacred
One of the authors said it's not the profane
It's the sacred, right?
And you're asking yourself
Why are they so crazy about the fact
That this can't be some people in the Bronze Age
Kicking back and getting
Recreationally super high
Going to a religious performance
That their family goes to
That their grandparents had been to
You know, that's why the people wear
The dye in their hair, man
It's just part of the society
It's part of our medicine
So what is wrong with you people?
What is wrong?
The modern Iron Age
Poop
Where's the next one?
Right here?
Here we go
I got an alarm going on
I'm sure you'd better find out what that is
The recovery of human hair
By Bronze Age burial cave
Provides a unique opportunity
For the probe and to the medicinal
And ritual realm
Of indigenous inhabitants
Of Western Mediterranean
3,000 years ago
The results finished direct evidence
Yeah, finished direct evidence
Of the consumption of plant drugs
Okay, okay
So yeah, we know that they took drugs now
I'm going to skip over that
And we're going to go to
Recent analysis of hair
Watch this
There's one really good scientific article
On this one, right?
In nature
And it's a fantastic
It's a fantastic article
And it goes over methods, right?
Analysis
You can get all the chemistry
For those of you geeks who are
HPLC people
And know what that means
You know, mass spectrometers
And all that kind of stuff
Equipment that we need
If that stuff turns you on
Then take a look at the one in nature
But here's a funny
Here's a funny reference to that
Recent analysis of hair
Of patients suffering from
Detura poisoning
Revealed atropine and scopolamine
In a patient who admitted
Regular consumption of detura
And only scopolamine
In a regular cannabis abuser
Wait a minute
A regular...
Is this thing scientific?
Do you people see what happens?
As soon as you get into this
World of the recreation
As soon as you get into this
World of the high
All of a sudden it's not acceptable
Right?
The cannabis abuser
How many people...
You can't abuse cannabis
That scientist needs to find out
That you can't abuse cannabis
You can't
You learn to make love
Not war
They should have said
The lover of cannabis
In that article
We found this lover of cannabis
And he had the...
What's the point, Poindexter?
The point is that he had the
Scopolamine and atropine
Or he didn't have the atropine
But he did have the scopolamine
So these chemicals are being liberated
And used
You know what the point is?
Fantastic
And they are terrible hallucinogens
You can put somebody into a state
Of complete total psychosis
And now you understand
Why we've been talking about
All these caves
All these caves
Dells give me a little more time
Than I, right?
These caves
And why they're going into the caves
Right?
It's where they found this stuff
Is in a cave
Right?
So there's got to be some
That's why they try to bring in the
Bring in the shaman
Just dirty
He probably smells bad
I bet the shaman's underwear are dirty
How much do you want to bet?
This one?
Fantastic
But the dire...
Oh, yeah
This is...
I want to read you
I wanted to get into a little bit of
A little bit of...
We're talking now about
Bronze Age drugs, right?
One of the areas
That people don't talk about
Are the Venoms
They come up all the time
On the witch side
They come up on the midwifery side
They come up on the oracular side
You got an oracular priest
Who were writing about
Oh, God, this is a great combination
Of X, Y, and Z
And you put this in and bam!
Right?
This stuff is great literature
There's more on theriax
As a matter of fact
I'm going to scare you a little bit
I hope I do
I was reading just this week
In a place that hasn't been translated
From Galen
He's writing about theriax
And he says there is a theriax
That is peculiar or particular to
The house of the Caesars
Yeah, it is their family mystery communion
Yeah
Do you know who Julius Caesar
Put a portrait of
In the temple of Venus, Genetrix
For those of you who are not in the know with Rome
I'm sorry
I don't mean to point
That's rude
But for those of you who are not in the know with Rome
Venus, Genetrix is our mother
Excuse me
I want to put my bracelet on
Venus, Genetrix is our mother
If you're a Roman
You know you're a descendant
Of Venus, Genetrix
Who does Julius Caesar
Get a portrait of
And set it up in the temple of Venus, Genetrix
He gets a portrait of Medea
He gets a portrait of Medea
Because the Kid and I know
Yeah, I've seen things
I've seen things
And I keep screaming about them
No, I don't scream about them
I just wrote papers
And went to conferences
And wrote a book
A couple of books
And now people are seeing
That the stuff is there
Let's take the next step
I was going to show you some texts
But I think we've gone beyond
Let us be satisfied in this
In this world
Where the drugs are used
In medicine and in health
And are a big part
Of the development of the religious
Attitude of the people
Yeah, these drugs have a tremendous
Tremendous influence on society
And the mystery as started by
And perpetuated
Through the Kalkians
Eventually, all the way
Through the Etruscans
Right?
How do we know?
How do we know?
This is what they're going to be
Finding out in the future
I told you I would do this
So they talk about the hair dye
We've got this red hair dye
Right?
Yeah, here we go
Here we go
This is the ferric oxide
Ferric oxide and where do you find this stuff?
You find this stuff in the Limnian Earth
You find it in what they called
Limnian Earth, Galen went to Limnos
To find this stuff
Because he claimed that it could heal
Breast tumors in women
Now he said other things about it
But that was one of the things
That caught me as a grad student
What?
Yeah
And he would
It's something special
I gave a paper on this
And people speculated about
What it could have been
In the Limnian Earth
Well, this stuff is also
A base for a dye, right?
It's a base for a coloring agent
You can make paint with it, right?
And what they would do
Is they would put it
For example, today I was reading a priest
Named a candor
Who said, look
If you're out and you get bit
And you don't have your coating on
It's your fault, right?
Your dermal coating
There are paints that you can put on
That will deactivate poisons
Yeah, very practical
If you think about it
Yeah, you can see people developing that
That makes perfect sense
Just like that stuff
The Medusa, the temple guardians
Put in their hair, right?
Did they drag their arrows across?
And then their arrows are poisonous?
Same kind of approach
It's a very naturalistic approach
It's why the world
Monotheism
When it encounters that world
Is on shaky ground
It's not flexible enough to absorb that
That nature, that pure exercise of nature
Right, stop, what you're doing
And that's where we get the Frankenstein
Well, it turns out that this substance
Right?
I'm going to pull up this in Greek for you
It's called Miltos
Miltos, red earth, right?
Red ochre
I guess on the Brit sign
They call it Ruddle
Ruddle, right?
It's this red lead
Or this oxide, right?
And notice that it's from Lenin
Look at Roman numeral number two here
In this Victorian classical philology
Paradise Island
Eurusive
Eurusive
What is Eurusive?
Oh, wait a minute
That's the rust that grows on the wheat
And hence, it is a title that we give to Demeter
A title, an epithet for her
Is this rust that grows on wheat?
And so, right away, I know
The neuroscientists out there, right?
I'm thinking of one in particular
But I'll pretend like I'm speaking to a group of them
You all know now that
Oh, okay, there could be a connection with the
Ergot and the LSD
Because it's that rust, that wheat rust
It's a fungus that produces the right stuff
You can paint that stuff on your skin
As well as put it into a barley meal drink
Right?
If your barley's rusted, right?
You can put it into a drink as well
Or you can put it on your skin
The Etruscans like to put it on their skin
You ever seen Etruscans?
They have, like, red skin
And you're like, what's that?
Right?
It's not because their colors were messed up
Right?
It's not because they...
We don't understand
Do you see how bright red that stuff is?
There's no way
Right?
What is that?
That's artificial
Yeah, no, it turns out it is
And we have descriptions of applying these things to your skin
And the dyes are huge
The dyes are huge
They called Hercules Porphyrian, right?
Because of the purple dye that he's marked with
And where is he getting that?
He's getting it in the mystery
And the only one allowed
Is the Herculane Mystery
Who is a female
One has a vagina
Has the black harbor
Right?
Medea alone is allowed in the right
So when the scientists
Dig up the hair
And they find on it
And everybody here who's been...
Because you all know I've been yelling about this
For the last few months
Here on our, you know
Venture in our Satanic initiation
Okay
They came up with physical evidence for it
Good for them
Good job, guys
Good job
Now let's keep going
And let's say, what do these formulae do?
How are they used?
Why were they using them?
Why were they inducing?
Was it a low enough level that they didn't induce?
You know, you weren't chronically walking around
In a state of psychosis
Right?
Were they Roman doctors?
That's the state where the Roman doctors are like
Come out of the tavern
He's like bleeding like a sheep
And irrational, right?
That's the dude that is on X
And you give him this antidote, right?
So we're not talking about...
We're not talking about...
Oh my God
You know, this discovery is great
Everybody should love this discovery
Because it is showing the world
That we have concrete drug use
That people cannot say
Any longer
That drug use isn't an integral part
Of the development of human history
Yeah, it's an integral part of our history
It is there
And maybe
I'll just propose one thing
I wanted to talk about the Dipsass poison tonight
And I wanted to talk about the Vipervenoms
That caused the thirst
And I wanted to talk about Jesus
Being so thirsty
I wanted to bring you guys back to that moment on the cross
I wanted you to get there
Because I want us to be able to get a clear picture
Of what the texts are representing
No more time
Buses already left for theories
And grand conclusions of idiot scholars
Now is the time for us to say, okay, what's here
And what can we apply?
And that's what I'd like to do
Is I'd like to help bring us forward then
And say, how can we really guard the information
That's in these texts?
Well, we can bring it into the museum
And open it up and let people see it
And maybe there's something there
Maybe there's something there about our exposure over time
We might...
They may have been right
We may be part of the generation
That would decline
There may be something about these substances
That will cause you to make more connections in your brain
That will cause you to not have so many inflammatory problems
There's potential here is amazing
Potential is amazing
Not to mention we can bring back Lady Babylon
That's what we need
The girl who is half viper
And brings that medicine
Good news tonight
We'll end here, but good news tonight
All the way from Jeff Monmouth
Who is giving us Merlin's prophecy
About the coming of the Puella
The girl who has the medicine
It's a prophecy
And it is sibling and origin
And Merlin is pushing it
Merlin knows something that we don't
Yes, we will see you on Friday
Unfortunately, it doesn't look like Derek
Although I'm sure that he would come otherwise
It doesn't look like we've convinced him
I tried, people, I tried
I told him people want to see you
People want to see you in women's lingerie
They want to see it
But he won't be coming Friday
You understand, the man has a reputation to uphold
I don't blame him
It's a good thing I don't
Because I'm free to do exactly what I need to do
So I'm bringing you this information
I'm going to continue with Friday
With new info to fill in the picture
So that we can get an understanding
Of what was actually going on
We're going to find that naked boy in the garden
With Jesus, we're going to bring him out
We're going to show people
And we're going to change the world view
And we're going to be uncomfortable doing it
In the process
But let the wave proceed
And hail Satan
When I say there was nobody no harm
When I say there was a cause for alarm
You'll understand what I meant something
Maybe I will too
Just put on different masks
