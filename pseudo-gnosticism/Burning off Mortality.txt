Greed stains your soul
Oh dear, Athena Belisema, do you like the hash?
I got the creeper reefer, we eat spaghetti for silly hours
I satin with the fruit and veggies of the cornucopia
Here, have a little taste, sip it wine, iron flavor
I got the bag of amethyst
Don't bring up, root cutter, new singer, Athena Lover
Got the lavender by the box full, oboe rigatoni coming through
High off the contact, it sounds nice, fruits of labor all night
The moon rise, dragon queen taking flight
I spun away from the treeline, hip-hop will make you feel fine
House of Frankenstein, Wolfman, charm time, root cutter
Don't bring up, Phoenix rising, that's how the devil rise
Don't bring up, root cutter, new singer, Athena Lover
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
I want you to know tonight
I just want to give you some intimacy for your brain
I love it, I love it, you know what's happening?
We're getting out there, we're getting out there
And do you know what's happening?
It's causing people to become angry
What kind of people are these?
The people whose souls are stained with greed
Congratulations, Satanic congregation
You have done it, you have done it in ways that you may not even yet understand
Congratulations, everybody involved, congratulations
Thank you, Teddy Bates, for the music tonight, for the intro and the outgo
I appreciate it
You can think of those as your hymns
Those are modern hymns
And we have our Orpheus, isn't it nice on the ship to have an Orpheus?
That's very nice, it's very nice
We have another person who needs a little bit of shout out
And that is Alderboy, because his series on the Purple is out
It's a great movement forward for the museum
Isn't it nice in the discoveries, just come out of the ground
There it is, the Purple
What are we going to get next?
I've told you what's coming
Tonight on Lady Babylon, we're going to take a look at some of your most deepest intimate secrets
We're going to bring them out and we're going to burn off your mortality
Doesn't that sound nice?
Burn off your mortality
If I was ever going to go to a priest, S
I would tell you, I would go in there knowing that she was going to burn off my mortality
God, how did religion become so unattractive?
How did it become so unattractive?
Tonight we're going to take a quick look at the Dove, MÃ©tis
Tonight we're going to look into a leucis
There are a hundred gazillion of these profiteers in the universe right now
Profiteering, it's important for everybody here to know
Lady Babylon is not monetized and will not be monetized
Everybody needs to know that's part of the contract with the devil
The esoteric vision evaporates
The muse leaves the minute I sit here and do this for money
Isn't that amazing?
True religion has the high standard
True religion has the high standard
There will be no passing of plates, offerings
We don't take offerings here
Do you know what that gives me the power to do?
It gives me the power to reach into the deepest, darkest cess
And pull it out and throw it in your faces
God, that real cess from the cesspool
Are you guys ready to go there tonight?
We're going to dive in deep
I want to see something
I want to see something
Did somebody say Penelope?
Somebody wants to see Penelope
Bring her up, Penelope
Thank you for coming tonight on demand
Please show us your cross
Show us your cross
Beautiful
Get the pollution out
We're going to find a place that hides a multitude of sin
Multitude
Hit me with the first couple
I've got to mention a couple of things that we didn't mention last time
That I want people to really jump into
Isn't this gorgeous?
Look at this word, people
Let's just start out with a beautiful Greek word
It's a beautiful, sexy, lovely Greek word
Look at this, Afron
Afron
What is something that is Afron?
It's without its frame
It's without its frame
It's without that power to perceive
It is senseless
It is senseless
It is frantic
It is crazed
Crazed, okay?
What a wonderful word, right?
Afron
Now, imagine
Look at the bottom there
What's it say?
Afron equals Goneon
What is Goneon?
That's Himlach
That's Himlach
Do you know what you do
When you've had a hard day
You stop off at any of the taverna
That lie in the street
And you go in
And you get yourself a Himlach tari
And if you drink too much of them
They're gonna open
They're gonna find you in a state
Where you are crawling on all fours
Look, he's doing the Himlach walk
Oh, what a time
What a time when Bacchus flowed through the streets
Remember those
Oh, God, you gotta love it
Give me the next word
We're not done
We're not done, right?
I'm just kidding you
Before we get out into the cult tonight
I want you to partake, people
Here's everybody partaking
Of this mental gorgeous drug combo thing
We've got going on
Look at this
Goneon is your Himlach
That's great
I didn't lie to you
Look at number two
Narthex
What is a Narthex?
What is the Narthex?
No, seriously
Seriously, what is it?
It's a tool
It's a tool
In it
Is carried the fire
That's the fire of salvation
The Narthex carries the fire of salvation
What were they actually doing with it?
What is it there for?
It is full of symbols
Now, come here
Come here
What's her name?
Who'd she write that?
I don't know
She was writing about myth
Some Brit
Now, that's what you deserve
All you myth writing
That's what you deserve
We don't want the myth
We want the anthropology
We want to know what they're doing
With the Narthex
Hit me with the next one
Hit me with the last drug
We're going to pump into their mental
Into their brains
Now, give me the next one down here
Boom
Boom
What is this drug, Galen?
That we've been talking about
Look in the very middle
It's an on-oldunos
It's an on-oldunos
It takes away your pain
Does everybody feel like
We've finally come to the right church?
This place is wonderful
This is a synagogue
I can be a dog about
Oh, look what they're giving us
They're giving us the painkiller
God, if I got painkillers
Every time I went to church
Look at you
Trapped in that tiny cube
That tiny cube
Like a pantomime
Right?
We're friggin' pantomimes
Oh, look at the drug use
Fantastic, go to the next one
Go to the next one
This is where I want to begin
What do I want to show you tonight?
This is the apocalypse
Who has what?
Who has ears?
Let them hear
What the Spirit says
To your assemblies
To those of you who overcome
I will give to you to eat
From the tree of Zoe
Okay
Wait, wait, wait
Who's Zoe?
Just in case anybody stepped out
We got out of the spaceship tonight, right?
Spacetime
We went back in the past
We're at the rights
Right, because that's all we ever do
You know it's a date thing
You and I have
You'd love it
You'd love going to these rights
You'd love going to them
On the internet right now
There are a ton of people
Who will tell you
This is the Ellucinian
This is the Ellucinian
This is the Ellucinian
This is the Ellucinian
Psychiatrist, psychologist
Mythicist
Oh, God
Oh, God
Indeed
Indeed
Tonight we look at the particulars
I'm going to take you into a Christing
Hail Satan
I'm going to take you into a Christing
That you have never seen
And it will explain to you
Exactly what Jesus was doing
Welcome to the mystery
Let's go
Now they're trying to sell this online
Anytime you buy a mystery course online
You're the one who's going to the back alleys
I don't want Satanic congregation
Hanging out in the back alleys
Okay, don't, don't
You're going to pay for it
You're going to pay for it
Yeah, and I don't mean money
Let's go to the next one
What is the promise here?
I know
I know people
I know what kind of troubles everybody's in
I know your poverty
Right, but you're really rich
You're not like that Satanic congregation
Wait, are you kidding me?
The Satanic congregation
Look, people, it's a letter
Oh, my God, it's a letter
And it's to us
Well, it's really to somebody else
But they're talking about us
You see, tonight the theme is
We're listening in on your conversations
And what does the Satanic congregation do
That really ticks them off?
Look at that second line, fourth word in
Blasphemeon
Blasphemeon
Do you want to hear the blasphemy?
Go ahead, take it down and poison the brains
Of everybody here tonight, Chewie
Do you want to hear the blasphemy of blasphemies?
I've got it for you
Take a seat, everybody who's eating your dinner
It looks marvelous, I can imagine it
It looks marvelous
Thank you for allowing me to be with you at this time
I thank you, on a Monday, fantastic
What is the blasphemy of blasphemies?
Tell us, Almond
Tell us, do you want to know?
First have to say, do you want to know?
Oh, you're going to love this
Are you ready?
God is a fabrication
Yahoo has a birth date
Before which time he did not exist
And do you know when his birthday is?
Yahoo, Yahoo, when's your birthday?
Everybody, happy birthday to Yahoo
Happy birthday to Yahoo
Happy birthday, Elohim Hashim Jova
It was in the third century
Show me the text
How does a person get to that point?
That can be so sure of himself
It's not me, people
It's not me
It's the muse
Muse of history, brah
All you got to do is follow
All you got to do is follow those words
It's in the words
They're evidence, man
They're the amber
That keeps all of that gorgeousness
Gorgeousity, all warm and snugly
Until one of us can drill into it
Take out a sample and find whatever it is
That mosquito was eating
20 million years ago
Oh, God, I love it, I love it
Okay, give me the next one
We can't let this go
It's going to get, well, hold on, people
Life vests on tonight
This is going to get a little bit heavy
Those of you who have those ears to hear
Like we're talking about
Satanic congregation, right?
This is what that muse says to you
The one who overcomes
Will not be treated unjustly
By the second death
They won't come across that second death
As a thing of decay
As a moment of justice, right?
There is something about going there
And coming back
Creates a bridge to understanding
Let's go to the next one
I think they gave us the drugs, yeah?
I think they gave us the drugs, right?
People, I want you to focus now on this image
I'm going to read to you from the hymn
There are four girls
And they are like goddesses
Four girls like goddesses
And what does it say?
The second half of that first line
What are these girls have?
They have the flower, anthos
They have the flower that is kureion
The flower of the korwa
This is old
You see statues of these korwa
All over the place, right?
And what do they have?
What are those?
They are in korek bloom
They are in korek bloom
Now you ask yourself
Who is it that we worship?
We worship the underworld korwa
That's who we worship
What do you think we do?
What we do?
Everybody comes and we all get initiated, right?
You're welcome for democracy
You're welcome
Such contempt
Go up, give me the source again
Chewie, when we were just...
Yeah, so here are these four girls
And they're in their korek bloom
And here are their names
What are their names?
Kalidike
Oh, that's nice
Beautiful justice is what her name means
Isn't that nice?
How would you like to wake up
And your daughter runs out to you in the morning
And you're cooking pancakes
And her name is beautiful justice
Come here, beautiful justice, right?
Do you know who the last goddess is?
To abandon mortals
Zeus is already gone, right?
Ares, he doesn't care anymore
He's out, right?
All of them gone
Even Eros is gone
But the one that always stays
To abandon mortals last
Is decay, justice
Justice, the test is people
Will you defend justice
Or will you take paola?
Isn't that funny?
That's the one thing justice hates
More than anything, paola
Paola, does it stain your soul?
Does the paola stain your soul?
Where's your cross, Christian?
What is your cross covering?
Didn't seem to do a good job
Terrible, terrible
It's sad
The history of Christianity is sad
What is the next daughter's name?
Clay C.D.K.
That glorious justice
Demo, the people
That's a nice one
And who's their eldest?
It's Khalithawe
Khalithawe
Oh, and she of course is the, you know
The progenestate
She's that really the first born leader
Give me the next one
The first born leader
And who are these?
I'm sorry, who are these goddess-like girls?
They are
Can you show the image?
Do you have the image?
They are the four girls
That came to the well
Where Da Maitre
Was sitting by herself
Because she had lost her kora
She had lost her kora
How did she lose her kora?
She took that narcissus, ba
She turned into it
Did you see what happened?
She went straight into the underworld
And do you know what Da Maitre wants?
She wants to bring her back
Okay, do you understand you're in the cult?
Do you understand the priest?
She is saying to you this song
There is a creator
And that creator sings
And this rite is a plug-in to that muse
Okay, okay, how do we get there?
How do we get there?
Is there a, you know, we're supposed to just all sit here
Sit here in the pew and feel the guilt of our conscience
With the blood of the cross
Covering us
God, I looked at her again
Back to confession
Nobody ever confesses
That's the problem
I confess you have driven me absolutely mad with love
Confess that
Good, let's go
What's the bridge, people?
What did he just say?
I think he just took a wrong turn
Yeah, no, it wasn't a wrong turn
It just didn't plan on going there
Look at this
What is this whole thing about?
I know an antitomon
I know an antidote
Wait, you mean there's words for antidotes here?
Within the hymn that we've been singing
About what Medea, excuse me
What Demeter, excuse me
What Lucifer is going to do to that child
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
Go to the next
I want to show them a couple of these words
That are so important
I know a remedy, right?
I know a remedy
I know some kind of antidote
Now, for those of you who are curious
That last reference in Greek under A
Is Pindar's Pythian Ode, number four
And that is a preserved oracle from antiquity
Given by the great Medwa, Medea
The one we call Medea
It was given by her
And she said, within a certain number of generations
This dude is going to go to this place
And he's going to found a colony
That was handed down to the Delphic oracle
This is all historical
There is no myth
This is historical recording via
Which is cool, via the oracles
People think the oracles were song and dance
Because everybody here
And here's the whip for everybody tonight
Everybody is bad
Even the sisters of frustration
That's what they come for anyway
Right? He's so clever
Mmm
Just thinking about that frustration
Just thinking about that
Makes me want to undo it
Makes me want to undo it
Yes, yes, see?
Thank you, Troy
Yes, spankings for everyone
Now, we have free spankings
Satanic congregation
Do you have to give any money?
No, but they will spank you
Yes, yes
Okay, go to the next one, please
I have...
No, go up to the one above that
What I wanted you to see here
Is that Pindar's Pythian Ode
Preserves this vocabulary
And it does so in kind of an elegant way
By preserving the oracle
You thought history started with Herodotus
Right? You thought, oh, he's the first dude
To sit down, dude
And write out his stuff
And say it on the porch of the temple
He'd be like, dude, tell his stories, right?
Cool, Ionian
That's super Ionian of you, right?
No, come on, man
We're stupid when we look at history
He wasn't the first historian
Do you know who was passing on history
And governance at the same time?
The oracles, the smart women, you boobs
The smart women from the ancient world
The smart women
Powerful
I was in a meeting just yesterday
With a couple of very, very
Fantastic, you know, people
And, you know, a scholar I truly admire
And we were in a group meeting
And they started to talk about
The idea that women didn't have
A voice in antiquity is hilariously bad
It's hilariously bad
And it covers up a real
It covers up a real woman-led
I'm not gonna say matriarchal
Because that's not the kid
Grown-up, crone model
The different Greeks are not using that
That's a fantasy of people
Who wanted to take you into a back alley
Yeah, that's a fantasy of those people
Made mother-
Made mother-crone
Are you kidding?
Are you kidding?
Even the guy-eye
The supposed crones of antiquity
Are said to be never aging
That they're always in bloom
The first time I read that I was like,
Oh, I get it
I didn't get it before
I get it
You see, gods can't age
And why can't gods age?
We're burning off the mortality
Why can't gods age?
Because they're full of ambrosia
Full of ambrosia
Do you have the ambrosia tonight?
Do you want the fruit of the tree?
I'll take two, please
I'll take two
Who's this handsome devil who's serving us tonight?
Oh, god, do you know what this is?
This is a picnic in the park
Not just any park, but paradise
Right, now do you see who the ay-wa is?
Now do you see who the ay-wa is?
Right
Oh, god
Right out of the third century, people
Right?
God's birth
Yahoo!
He came out of the third century
Wasn't here before
That's why everybody is chasing
Is currently chasing stones
To try to find
That says yesahoo
No, no, no, no
It's gotta say yahoo way
Right?
And so this is how we do it
They're fighting
They're looking for it
I got news for you, people
He wasn't born until the third
Moses and Noah, all of them
They're a third century creation
Isn't it interesting?
Stop for a minute and look into the mirror
Especially if you're an evangelical
Look into that mirror
Your world is a fantasy
Generated in the third century B.C.
Your world is a fantasy
Generated in the third century
Anybody, anybody at a church
Or a synagogue
Your reality is a falsehood
It's a falsehood
You're modest
What happened was your religion
Was a modest creation
That is a one god
Right?
A one god creation
At a specific time in history
You, if you have a synagogue
Or a church
You are a reaction
To the multiplicity of gods
Like love and like
Complete and total
Erotic desire
And justice
Don't forget justice
Don't you love nemesis?
Come on, people
Who wouldn't worship nemesis?
That dude got what he deserved
Don't you want to see
The dude get what he deserves?
You want to
Why?
Because you and I
We worship nemesis
We are the dawn bringers
We are the dawn bringers
We have to be on
100% with everything
That's the standard
You want to follow the satanic contract
You want that esoteric knowledge
You have to prove that you can handle it
Isn't that something?
It's amazing
You can't sell it
You can't sell it
I don't want your money
I don't want your money
Devil hates that stuff
Go to the next one
Okay, people, look
This is going to get good
Hit the next one
After antitamos
Fine, what is an epelucie?
Right?
It's a power, right?
Demeter knows those powers of literally
Those things that come over you
Those things that bind you
That envelop you, right?
Look how they translate it here
Coming over by spells
A, B, witching
Do you understand what the witch does now?
That witch is going to work in ways
That you may call medicinal, right?
She understands that it's a juggling of your forces
That is an attraction and a repulsion
She knows
She has the pharma con cristo
She has the pharma con cristo
Because she's got the knowledge and antiquity
Of where to find those roots, man
And she goes out with the ladies
And they strip down naked
And they oil themselves up
And they collect roots
And if they catch you as a man out there
Because of the substances that they're using
Because remember, collecting roots is a ritual
You know, just go out and dig into the ground
Like some, you know, goodness
I can't say the R word or I'll get in trouble
But you know what I mean?
It rhymes with papest
Did you ever notice that?
Okay, let's go, let's go
Look at that workshop, by the way
That's a gorgeous workshop
I bet you could put books in there too
And then the books would smell
I used to go to Dr. John Scarborough's basement
When I was a graduate student
We would go after school
This is fun, I can tell you this
We would go after classes
I was one of his graduate students
And he only had two at the time, right
And we would go out to have
To the pub, to the pub
And have a pint after class
And yeah, those joyous moments
Would be ended by us ending up
Back at his house in his basement
He has this giant basement
And he had just thousands upon thousands of books
And he was a collector through black wells
I think it was
And so he got books all the time
It was just impossible to get
And he had this incredible collection
Smelled, they all smelled of pipe tobacco
Everyone, you'd open up those books
And it just hits you in the face
You had to smoke, you know
In order to be there in those books
He fumigated that place
That's how you hold a museum, baby
That's how you do it
I got a lot of respect
I got a shout out for John Scarborough
Hit the next one
What I want to show you tonight is this
Look at number two
This thing that is the safeguard
Against witchcraft, the Erosimos
It is also a vegetable
The seed of which was eaten by women
In childbirth
Now, notice that we've come to a place of
You think we've come to the hospital
I told you we're in the temple, right
We're performing the mysteries
And one of those have to do with
They're directly connected to
The art of childbirth
Your mystery cult comes from childbirth
And a bunch of very intelligent
Chemically driven women
Yeah, gorgeous, I love it, man
It makes me so
I want these women to come back
Where are these women?
Right, where are these women?
Who's building the portals
To bring these women back?
This is for the portal builder
Get it done
Give me the next one
Let's get something that
No Bible scholar in his life
Now, this next verse will shatter
Every Bible scholar
Every...
Well, lots of religion scholars
But mostly the Bible scholars
Yeah, man, I mean old and new
Torah and New Testament
You know what I mean?
Prophets through the prophets in there
Right, for you guys
I'm speaking to you with this one
This is going to blow your mind, right
She nourished...
What is Da Maitre Demeter?
What does she do?
She nourishes the boy in the home
And he grows
Like a demon
That's what it says
He grows like a demon
He becomes better in a demonic way
He doesn't eat
He doesn't eat food
And you won't see him taking the milk
Right?
You're not going to see him taking the milk
Of anybody, right?
During the day
Demeter who wears that gorgeous crown
She cries him
Look at the second to last line
Riesk
And they have lighted
They have lighted the epsilon at the end of that
So it can run together musically
Because it sounds better to say
Riesk ambrosie
Than it does
Riesk ambrosie
You hear her?
Riesk ambrosie
Ho, ho, ho
Now I sound like those stupid Anglo-Saxons
Okay, that's why they make...
They take out letters in Greek
Let it flow
Let it flow
We don't do that with our language people
Sorry, sorry
It's just the way it is
What does that say, though?
She cries him with ambrosia
Go ahead
Go ahead
She cries him
With ambrosia
Okay
Now what does the ambrosia do?
The ambrosia is that ionic power
That keeps us from dying
That boy is having his mortality removed
Okay, let's see
Let's see
Now look
Right there is a reference
Now this...
This hymn...
What am I reading to you?
This is the hymn...
The Homeric hymn to Demeter, bruh
This doesn't...
This doesn't get any more authoritative
Dude
Yeah, this is it
This is it, people
And we are Christing
We are Christing
And who is Christing?
Our savior is Christing
Are you crazy?
Let's burn him up
Give me the next one
No, that one
Yep, good
Look
Now there is a strange expression here
On the last line
It says
What does Demeter do?
And this is so sexy, beautiful
If you can't see the sexiness in this
You're an idiot
It says
What is she doing?
She's breathing into him
This sweetness
She's breathing into him
The sweetness
Give me the next
I've got the definition here
Give people to see it
Give me that one
Maybe this one
Go
No, that's the hymn
We're going to come back to that
Here it is
Oh, right
Oh, my God
What does it mean to blow upon?
To breathe upon?
Yeah, look at number two
To inspire
Oh, yeah
And then three again to blow upon
That one would blow Dan's mind
Because look, you can pick the bottom one
But it's the same as the top one
So his logic would be like circular
It may cause a little
In his brain
You know what I mean?
Just a little
Why?
Like some circus
We're just like, nope
Overheated, boom
Love it
Go back to the passage
What does she do?
She cries him with that ambrosia
And she inspires him
And then we get this fine
This last
Oh, and it says
As if he is the son of God
As if he is the son of God
What is she doing?
She's Christing him with ambrosia
As you do
With the sons of God
And there were in those days
The sons of God
And the daughters of men
And the sons of God
Because they had had their mortality
Burned away
Yeah
They taught
Those daughters of men
They taught them how
With the drugs
That's what it says, Enix says anyway
Love it
Let's go back
Do you see how it works now?
Is everybody getting it?
Nah, right
People are always writing me saying
Oh, now this makes sense
Did you know X, Y, and Z?
Exactly
Right?
Clicks in
As soon as you see the reality of the text
And the anthropology of the culture
That thing is submerged in
Oh, God, it's just so glorious
But then we get this last phrase
So she cries him with the ambrosia
As the son of God
And she inspires him with this sweetness
And then
She has or possesses him
In her colpo scene
Now, colpos
Colpos is an interesting word
And here it's in the plural
What does she do?
While she's Christing him
She has him in her plural colpos
And what does the colpos mean here?
The definition
We're gonna get back to that one, don't worry
What is the colpos definition here?
Look at this
Nah, that's it
This one
That's for you
Nope, not above that
Oh, yep, that's it
That's it
A bosom or lap
Oh, that's nice
A bosom or a lap
A bosom
Did everybody know what a bosom is?
That's not real
Somebody needs to update these Victorians
On what bosoms are
Look at number two
It equals a doyun gunaikaeon
Now, you can hear gynecological
In gunaikaeon, right?
A woman's what?
A woman's a doyun
Oh, God
Have we entered a sacred place?
Because that's the only...
We gotta step back for a minute
We gotta step back
What does that mean there?
It says especially
And then there's words
Probably, I don't know
Maybe that word will get me thrown off
YouTube
So maybe I can't say it
Beep it out myself
But biologically, it's the vagina
Right?
You have a penis on the male
You have a vagina
You didn't know this was educational, didn't you?
You have a penis if you're a male
And you have a vagina
And those are organs used in reproduction
And various activities that involve
Bacchic ritual and celebration
And sometimes the consumption of
Communion between two people
Yeah, interesting
There it is
Blow it up
And look who the source is on the end
The source's guide name
Soranus
No, that's his name, really
He writes about gynecology
He should have changed his name
If anybody needed to change his name
It was Soranus
Give me that one
Look at this
Here's the verb here from Chrio Chriesque
And I want you to notice
Look what they've done
Now, this is a little level that
This is a little level that
We can start to appreciate as Greek students
Look at the last two letters
It's sigma and kappa
Whenever you have that sigma and kappa
Attached to a verb like that
It means something special
Give me the next slide
Look what happens to it
She's not just Christing him
She's Christing him with an iterative
An iterative?
Yeah, yeah
Homer and Herodotus use him
And this is a Homeric hymn
So it only makes sense, right?
And what are those all about?
Look at the end of the second line
They denote a customary
Or repeated past action
It is customary to Christ
This is what they do in the riot, people
That kid is being exposed
You know what that kid is doing?
That kid is screaming
The kid's not sitting there all
He didn't have some kind of
Hair made out of, you know, goats
Goats, you know, and
You know, he's not wearing flowers, right?
He's not having a grand time
She's performing an operation
That is extremely painful
It's so painful that the mother
Comes in and sees it and says, stop
Yeah
You remember Jesus in the garden
When he's got the stuff on his face
Uh-huh
You remember what he looks like
You remember what he was acting like
He was stumbling around
And he was paranoid
You know
Yeah
It's a Christ thing in the eyes
For some reason
I suppose that, you know
The chemists can work it out
People were mad
I don't know what the indole broke me
I'm sorry
I'm sorry
Somebody said on the internet
I'm a chemist
I'm not a freaking chemist, dude
My science side is bacteriology
And I studied infectious disease
So that I could write about plagues
And drugs and antiquity
The plagues that were there
And the drugs that they used to treat them
That's what I was
Yeah
So don't believe everything
People are saying funny things on the internet now
And by the way
There's traffic out there
People are plotting
People are plotting the end of almond
Oh, yes
Isn't it gorgeous?
Don't you love that?
I love that
I suck that like ether
Let's go
That's better
That's better than anything like that
You know what the best drug is?
Somebody's soul
Alright
I know that's gonna sound a little
I don't know
It's kind of like Dracula or something
Isn't it?
You know what I mean?
But there's a little bit of that
In the dragon, right?
There's a little bit of that
Consumption of the soul
That is there
There's nothing
There's nothing more ambrosial
Now do you understand the name
The sacred name of Rome
Excellent
Good
Do you understand?
Excellent
Go to the next one
Don't let them get to you
And thank you
B
Is that BW?
Thank you
Thank you very much BW
I appreciate that
We won't
You know why?
There's too much soul sucking we can do
You give somebody
Think about it, people
You give somebody the reality of these texts
That they cannot recover from it
They can't
It forms a permanent
Permanent antidote in their brain
Yeah
That's why we need to show them
We, Satanic congregation
We should uphold the Bible
More than anyone
Right?
It's funny
The trick was
In the dream
The trick was not to run from it
The trick was to run toward it
Yeah
That's where the victory comes from
And to those who achieved the victory
I will give
To overcome that second death
Oh, God
It's gross
It's gross, man
It's the grossest stuff on the planet
Give me the next one
Watch what happens here
We didn't go through the choreo
But we don't have to
This is good, Chewie
I like that you landed
What does she do with that boy
That she is putting through the operation
To burn off his mortality
During the night time
Because remember we said
What happens during the day
She's Christing him during the day
And what does she do in the night?
She hides him in the fire
She hides him in the fire
He's like a torch
He's like a torch
Do you know what a torch is?
You put stuff on it
And it burns
Okay
If that mother
Had not stopped
Domated from creating that transformation
If she hadn't stopped the process
That boy would have understood
Who he was
He would have seen
And he would have lost his fear
He would become as a god
The fruit of the tree
Is there for you
The fruit of the tree is there
Alright
Let's go to the next one
That was a somber
That was too somber
Give them the hymn
I want you to see the hymn now
This is the Orphic hymn
To Ellisonian Demeter
This is the Orphic hymn
To Ellisonian Demeter
And I want you to go down
To the...
Oh god it's so beautiful
That word, first of all
In the third line
Pluto de Tera
She's really the giver
Of what is wealth
What is wealth
And it's not money
That's the problem
You don't see right
You haven't been there
You don't see right
You still have that corruption
Your greed stains your soul
What it stains your ruin
Okay
And what is she
I just want you to scroll down
Oh where did it go
Oh god there was something
Oh yes look she's the
Look in the underlined red portion
She's the soonestius
Of Bromius Dionysus
What does she do
You didn't know this did you
She's that one who stands next to him
She's that one who comes
To his defense
She is that assistant
She is that nourisher
Of the child
She's the dimon
It says at the top
She's the pole
Who automate dimon
What does that mean
She's the dimon
With many names
Have you heard of somebody
Who is dimon
Of many names
Lady Babylon
Lady Babylon is
She of many names
The mystery is written
On her forehead
Oh god how sexy
Is that how sexy is that
Yeah yeah your third
Century jealous
Woman hating
Divinity you monists
You're just like Akhenaten
You're just like that group
Right that's what the religion does
It's what human religion does
So physics
It goes monist
And when it does
Everybody outside the box
Can justifiably die
It doesn't matter if it's women
Doesn't matter if it's men
Doesn't matter if it's old people
Doesn't matter if it's kids
Whoever is outside the box
Woo that's some awful stuff
I want you to look at what else is in here
What else is in this hymn
Look she is conveyed
See those other two
Underline red there
She's conveyed by the what
The power of the dragons
By the power of the dragons
And just look at that
Underlined word
That says dracontheon
Dracontheon
And look directly above it
And you're going to see the word
Paidophile
Paidophile
Paidophile
Does that sound like anything I know
Paidophile
Well, the fee-loss route is to love
And the pice is a child
Who is that one
Who performs the initiation
The paidophile
Yes
Give me the definition
Look at what these Victorians did
They're so embarrassed
You brits, I have a number
Of very intelligent people
Across the Atlantic
And across the pond
Who are sitting there
And following the traditions
That the Brits made
With the Oxford
Greek lexicon
The LSJ Alice
And those people there
And what do they say
They're hymn and hawn baby
Why do we have to say one thing is another
Just come out and say what it is
It's too Victorian
Purge the Victorian blood
You people in England
This is for those
You know when I was in Newcastle
And that group of
Saucy ladies of the evening came
Surrounded me
Pinched my cheeks
This is for them
Stop being that way ladies
You got to be a little bit, you know, direct
Oh
God
Paideraste
It says it equals a paideraste
That's their way of getting around saying
Well tell me, what is a paideraste
Then I'll play your little game
It's a lover of boys
Mostly in a bad sense
Does it sound like
A dictionary that you would
Read in the English language
No, it doesn't sound like a dictionary
What is that, that's a Victorian sentiment
Right, the guys are looking
Around like not me
No, no
It's mostly
In a bad sense
Yeah
Okay, now you know
What the paideraste is
And yes, we get our English word
The Christ
Is in the position
Of opening the eyes
That Christ
Is the paideraste
This is a direct
Link
Between
The definition, the classical definition
Of a paideraste
And the performance
Of the Christ mystery
Yes, now why is this, remember
She, da meiter
Is a curotrophos
What does she do, she nourishes
The curos
And sexuality
Is part of the process
Because
She is the paidophile
She is the one
Who expresses the love
For the curos
Oh, okay
The great mother, right
Da meiter
It's just mother
God
Mother Zeus
Da
And remember this is
Centuries, oh god
There's 1500 years before this
When these rites are being performed
Before Christianity
Before Moses was ever a figment
In the imagination of the
Hellenistic person
Who created her
The Hellenistic author who created him
Yeah, yeah, fantastic
Go to the next one
Oh, there it is
Boom, now tonight
We're going to switch gears now
I'm going to stop with what I showed you
And I just, because this is making such a splash
I want to reinforce this
Because this is one of the points that I bring up
That have gotten people
Just crazy mad
And you love it, you love it
You love it
But apparently there's a lot of people
Who are very upset at the idea
That the Torah
The Jewish holy writings
Were originally written in Greek
Apparently that's a, that's, you know
It's quite undercutting
To the whole narrative, right
It takes Moses and Abraham
And it turns them into
Fictional characters
From the third century
That are using the culture
Of the mystery
To create a
Honest reform
Of religion
Yeah, aka Judaism
Third century BC
Uh-huh, with all the synagogues
What did all the synagogues have in them?
Ion and the zodiac
Do you guys know your zodiac?
I had to learn the zodiac stuff
Yeah, yeah
Now let's not go crazy with it, right
Let's not go crazy with it
Kai, Apen, look at verse 3
What is this? This is Genesis
So tonight
I'm gonna start doing this at the end
I'm gonna just give you a quick flash
Of how incredibly
Terrible the Hebrew translation
Of the Greek is
Right, tonight they're making up words
Just to be able to suit Greek
It's hilarious, watch this
This is Genesis
This is Genesis chapter 11
Yeah
And what's happening?
We're around the time of
You know, we're looking at Babel, right?
Right?
Oh God, and a man said to his neighbor
Dale, Dale, Dale, get over here
Plain Thales, Solomon, Plain Thos
Let's fire
Some bricks
Now watch this people
Let's fire some bricks, just think about that
Just think about that
Simple little statement
Let us fire
Bricks
Okay, cool, because they're gonna build something
There's nothing, there's nothing
Look what the Greek does
Look at the end of the second sentence
Plain Thales, Solomon
And then the beginning of the third sentence
Plain Thos, do you notice that those
Have the same root in them
The Greek loves to do this
And has been doing it
For a long time
By the time this document comes up
And because this is Hellenistic
Greeks were trying, especially
We're associated with the museum
They were trying to kind of elevate
The Greek back to what it was
Right? They're trying to
They're bringing a lot of vocabulary
It's highly, highly specific
But they're also stylistically
Trying to harken back to that old
Fashioned way of doing
Greek where you take two words
Put them right next to each other
That have the same root
Usually one is a verb
And the other is a noun or an adjective
Right? It's just the way
It's just what they like to do, dude
It's their style, right?
And so you Plain Thales, Solomon
You prepare a brick
Or fire a brick, and what are you firing?
Plain Thos, those bricks
Right?
Oh, what?
Just tell me, what does the Hebrew do with this?
What does the Hebrew do with this?
Watch this, people
The fact that people can say
This is a total joke
Look at the first word up here
I just do the making of the bricks
Right? Lebanon
Lebanon, let's see what that is
Let's see, are they, by the way
Are the bricks related here?
Right? Is the baking related?
Let's see, let's see if it's from the
What's going on?
What kind of terms are they using
To translate this?
To make a brick
Or to be made
To make whiter
Okay, so the Hebrew is using a word
For the baking of the bricks
That's a primitive root to become white
Okay
Okay
To
Make bricks, are they doing the thing
Where you've got the same?
Let's see what happens, same base
Give me the next one
So, what is the word
For brick? Wait a minute
Lebanon
This thing, just like the Greek
Is using the same root
This thing
Lebanon
Which means to be white
But also a brick, which by the way
Seriously
Seriously, you guys
I know you don't
I know you know this
Is not the best work
I know you do, look at this
Look at the linguistic laziness
Give me the next one, this is terrible
They need to be told
Take a look at how classical
Philology works
What's the problem here
So it does have the same root
The brick and the brick making
But look what happens
The word for rock that he's about to use
It also has the same root
And it means a stone
Okay
Okay, what's going on?
Now we've used
Three
Words with one root
In them
What is going on?
What's it mean at the bottom?
What is the word for stone?
It's the word for, it's used for a charm
Wait, what?
Cornerstone?
Death?
Oh my god, this is a made up word
Look at how many places they plugged
Look at how many holes in the wall
They plugged with it
Differing weights, hailstones, jeweler
There's about 50 words in Greek in there
Lapis lazuli
A plum line
Is it a brick?
Is it a rock? Is it a plum line?
Is this which going to hit me in the head
With a brick or something? Where am I?
What you're seeing here
Is one language
Inventing itself
In order to translate another
And that's the secret
Of Greek and Hebrew
Hebrew is an attempt
Ancient Hebrew, not modern
Ancient Hebrew is an
Attempt
To translate
Greek
It's an attempt to legitimize
Itself through the behemoth
That was there
Dominating with its
1.5 million
Over 8000
It's the history of
The world, man
And it's gorgeous, you see
At this point I can make out there tonight
It's that we look at history
Through the wrong
With the wrong
Direction
We look at it the wrong way
We should have been looking at the languages
We should have been looking at the languages
Because the languages preserve that
Reality
And this is the reality that's here
Ancient Greek has the clothes
You're right
You're right, Jesus Christ sick
Jesus sick, Christ sick
I don't know what that means
I don't know what that means
It's scaring me
Go to the next one
Look, another brick and another title
That's fine, go to the next one
There's the word for burning
I was going to talk about that a little bit
That's okay, I don't need to
The point has been made
Go to right here
By the way, there was something
In this process of making the bricks
Stickiness, put them together
Right, some kind of mortar
To put them together and the Greek says
You got asphaltos
Right, wait
Asphaltos
Does that sound familiar?
Yeah, it does
What is it? It's asphalt
Bitumen
Kind of petroleum, it's pitch
Right, it comes from sphalo
The very word for it comes from a Greek word
It's just got the alpha-private on the front
It's sphalo to deteriorate
And asphalo would be to be
Not deteriorating
Not being destroyed
It's asphalt
Now, give me what the, how does the Hebrew
Come up, give me the next one
And I just want you to see, look at this chart people
This is all the different
This is asphalt with all the different
Manifestations of
Look at how common this word is
In ancient
That includes coin
Look at how common it is
Look at how many different things it's got
Holy mackerel
It all comes around
Is this going to say treacle?
Love that stuff
You know that stuff? There's a well
Never mind, you Brits will get that
Give it the next one
They didn't say it was smart
That's the point
Watch this people, what does he do?
What does this word mean?
What does the Hebrew word mean?
That they're translating asphaltos for
Himmar
Right, and what did they say?
It's bitumen, that's
Bitumen is the Roman word for asphaltos
Right
And then they just put asphalt
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Yeah
This is amazing people
Right in the definition
You want to know where this word comes from
There's two classical words there
To explain it to you
And it's being used for centuries
Before the Bible
Is ever written
Now, people like
Dan will tell you
Dan and Kip
They will tell you
There's a wall of separation
Between Christians and everybody else
And these words will not come across
Right
Oh God
Right, this is why they don't make
Classicists
Here's one last example
I just want to throw this to you
Look at verse 7, come on now
Let's go down in
Let's confound their tongue
Let's confound their tongue
It's in the singular
Everybody
Strokes for everyone
Says God, this is God
Yes, the humans are cooperating
Right
So, you know, that's never good
So, they can't hear each other
They can't hear their own voices
Let's go down and
They're tongue
What does that mean?
Just look at the third line down
To pour together, to come together
Or to confound
That sounds odd, like an odd group
To be putting together
They have a word that means to bring together
And
In doing so, to confound
You know what an epileptic seizure is?
It's when your timing
Is all brought together
It's when those nerves start firing off in unison
You get a little storm
In the brain, and that's an epileptic seizure
Right
Oh God
Do you understand what they're grasping?
Now watch this, give me the
Give me the next one
Which is the Hebrew
Look, those are those three words
Now watch this, get that definition
Here's a Hebrew word
Which, oh my God
Happens to mean exactly
The same thing
That an already established Greek word
Is meant for centuries
What are you looking at?
You are looking
At proof
That
Hebrew is constructed
Around Greek
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
This will make them so mad
This will make everybody
So mad
Don't you love it?
It's gorgeous, isn't it?
We're creating words now
That are the exact mirrors
Right, we're taking culture
And why is that?
Because this is the culture
The Jewish people
Or person, we don't know how many authors there were
Doesn't say
That the Jewish people
Who created the Torah
Those people
Were trying to
Borrow
From the power of the Greek language
They were harnessing
That power to bring it in
To create
And that's why it's in the beginning
Uranos
Two gods
Two Hellenistic creation
Gods right up top
It's the language of Greek
That is the origin
Of the Hebrew Bible
Give me the last one
This is gorgeous
Look what happens
Look what they do
They start talking about Arabic
Arabic
Because they want
Some sort of semantic connection
And you would think
When is the oldest Arabic from?
They'll say
8th century
8th century BC
Show me
It doesn't exist then
We don't have any surviving
We just think
Are you kidding?
Are you joking me?
When is the first written Arabic?
It's in the 500s
Anodomani
Do you see what the language is doing?
This is incompetence
This is complete
Incompetence
But it is driven
By a powerful desire
Just like you have the
Numerologist
It's driven by an extreme
Desire
To justify
The language itself
Look, this language is legitimate
And the claims that the texts make
Are legitimate
It's an attempt to create
Legitimacy
Wow, but it's a creation nonetheless
The sacred Hebrew
Is attempting
To reflect the Greek
Of the original
Isn't that gorgeous?
Let's round this out
With Penelope
Use all of your images
Oh, Penelope
We come to you tonight
With the utmost humility
For we know, Penelope
What lies behind your cross
We know
That like us
We are covered
By the blood of Christ
The one
Who is burning off our mortality
The
Tidophile
Oh, God
Oh, God
Thank you for coming tonight
I'm sorry if what you've been seeing
Is disturbing
And I know you'll be a little bit disoriented
Don't worry
Sleep it off and tomorrow
Everything will be normal again
No, I'm just kidding
It's going to be stuck in your brain forever
Have a great night
Thank you everybody for coming
The fact that 841 people are here
Others to take seriously
What we're talking about
To open up the museum
I want everybody to hear to know
If I were there, I'd give you
I'd give you just a gorgeous hug
I'd give you just a gorgeous, lovely hug
Just imagine it
Thank you for coming tonight
Hail Satan
Don't bring up
Group cutter

New singer
Athena lover
