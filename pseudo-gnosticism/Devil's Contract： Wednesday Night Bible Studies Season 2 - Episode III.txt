Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace? Where is that whore called Destiny?
I think she ran on without me
Thank you for coming in tonight. You are in for such a treat.
I want to start us off by saying we're going to talk tonight to the issue of the coming of Cersei.
That's right. I have brought to you tonight Cersei herself right into the man pig pen.
This is wonderful and she will keep the flow going.
I've given her full permission to follow both the way of Sodom to employ the Alabastrian where need be.
Those of you with ears to hear know what I'm talking about.
This is great. I'll introduce that in a second.
But before we get started, let's be brainwashed for a second.
Real.
Thanks for coming tonight. This is going to be outstanding.
We've got to pack everything into our 30 minute attention span.
Here we go.
I want to first introduce you to Cersei who will be joining us now on the chat.
She is there specifically to inspire the men pigs.
She is there with her wand. She will drug you. She will put you under. She will beat you.
You are a beast and sometimes she will walk among your ranks and she will pick one of you out.
People will descend on you and you will be made into a meal.
It's fantastic. It's very Bacchic.
Yes. So welcome tonight Cersei.
Please let the fun commence.
Tonight I've had a lot of people asking me about magic who want to learn the magic.
In order for us to get there with the Bible studies, we follow Jesus right at the crack opening of his ministry.
Right when his magic hits skyrockets, we follow him tonight.
On the way there, we will stop.
I just want for us to jump out of the time machine for a minute.
It's just right around the corner. It's not that far away.
I'm talking 17th century, early 17th century witch hunting.
Witch hunting. And remember when we talk about witch hunting, we're talking about people killing other people.
So this is good real history here.
We're not talking dress up here. I don't want anybody with black lipstick.
There's no reason for that unless the fashion dictates.
Anyway, we'll stop off there just briefly.
So that's what I want to do. Let's jump right into the text.
And we're talking about the devil's pact.
The devil's pact.
So let us commence.
Guazo, come over here. Yeah, get Frank, get over here.
This is, oh, pulling it right out. Guazo, tell us what's going on.
Well, as the men of old associated witches with marvelous deeds, sir,
John of Salisbury says that when God permits witches can with the help of demons,
shake the elements together and alter the true appearance of things.
This is quantum magic. This is not fairy tale magic. This is quantum magic.
They can foretell much of the future.
Can anybody smell where we're going? This is fantastic.
They confuse the mind of men with dreams.
Oh, and by the way, these witches aren't all female, as he's about to say.
These are men that we might call a mage.
Yeah. Okay. Yes.
And nearly by the potency of their charms, drugs can cause death, et cetera.
Saxo grammaticus. Isn't that a nice name?
Saxo. Saxo. Yeah.
Saxgram as we call them writes the giants and sorcery in the north practiced unheard of wonders with various illusions.
Yeah, what kind of illusions and could so skillfully deceive men's eyes that they hid their own features and those of others on the various phantasms.
You have just stepped into the fagress.
This is not medieval magic.
This is ancient magic.
Yeah, ancient quantum physics, the manipulation of thought, the visibility, the rearrangement in order to create.
Okay. Here's where we are. We're landing here.
Okay. Can you just tell us a couple more things here? Yeah.
And they obscure the true shape of things. Yeah.
They did other marvels of those, which we have already told of Simon Magus.
Thanks. Thanks. Okay. Yeah, I get it. I see where we're going.
Pythagoras made his thigh appear to be golden.
Why would he do that?
And by his spells tamed an eagle with which he often conversed. Oh, yes, of course.
Right. He's one of those that talks with the eagle.
Fantastic.
Yeah. Okay. So here's what I would like you to do.
Mr. Witch Hunter, could you please tell me?
What is this thing that we call the pact with the devil?
What? What? Where is it?
It's because I think it's with Jesus.
I think so. Tell us.
The packs formed between a witch and the devil may be either expressed or tacit.
The expressed packed. And by the way, for those of you in a legal language department, watch, keep an eye on this.
The expressed packed consists of a solemn vow of fidelity and homage made fidelity and homage.
Yes, proskinesis bending the knee.
Yeah. Okay.
In the presence of witness.
What we have witnesses, right?
To the devil visibly present in some bodily form.
That is an expressed pack.
Yes.
Expressed. Now the tacit packed.
For those of you who choose that path.
Involves the offering of a written petition to the devil.
And may be done by proxy.
Proxy. What is a proxy?
Yeah, someone endowed with that authority.
Okay.
Through whom that deal can be made.
For which male or female.
Or some third person when the contracting party is afraid to see or to have speech with the devil.
Are you afraid to talk to the devil? How many of you have talked to the devil?
I sent you to the devil.
Right.
Brian calls this a tacit packed.
Yet although it is made with another person than the devil.
It is expressly made in the devil's name.
Important contractual.
As is clear from the examples he gives, perhaps we should class as an express pack.
That rather rare insistence of a German woman who jumping backwards out of her tub.
Said that example of a German woman who jumped out of her bathtub and said quote.
As far as I thus sleep away from Christ so near may I come to the devil.
But there are certain matters common to all their packs with the devil.
And these may be arranged under 11 heads.
That's a lot of legal lingo.
It makes you wonder.
But this is what stands between you and the performance of the magic.
A packed tacit.
We tacitly make a packed.
In this temple where we are awaiting the return of Lady Babylon.
We make a packed.
First, they deny the Christian faith.
Looks like many of us are there.
Was draw their allegiance from God.
Anybody out there was drew your allegiance.
They repudiate the protection of the Blessed Virgin Mary.
Keeping the vilest insults upon her and calling her harlot.
And the devil arrogates honor to himself.
As Augustine notes.
There's your source you smell that with Augustine.
Always look at who the sources are when you're casing this crime scene.
And you're working in the direction of showing someone of bringing someone so that they can see.
Their religion and their morality are built upon a pedophile.
A child raping pedophile.
Who are the sources?
Here it's Augustine.
That's who he's digging up.
So if we want to put ourselves into his lane, you can see it as it builds in history.
Therefore, Saint Hippolytus, the martyr writes the devil compels them to say quote.
I deny the creator of heaven and earth.
Isn't that fascinating?
There is.
And Gaia.
Once again, can you swim those channels in that cave?
Now you're going to follow some solid rope through that dark cave to the other side.
Yeah, or you're going to die.
Yeah.
So follow the rope.
Reason, right?
Gets us there.
I deny the creator of heaven and earth.
I deny my baptism.
I deny the worship I formerly paid to God.
I cleave to thee and in thee I believe.
How many of you have done that?
My conversations with you.
Many of you are beyond that already.
You've already made a pact with the devil.
You didn't realize it.
Yeah.
Nice.
Nice.
Second, he bathed them.
In a new mock baptism.
Do you remember where the launch pad is?
The launch pad in the son of God's ministry is the baptism of John.
John V.
And if you'll notice, he cracked open.
Uranus.
Yeah, the Greek is very explicit.
It's ripped apart through which this spirit comes and compels him.
Into the solitary confinement where he is approached by the master himself.
Yeah.
The ruler who sits upon the throne, the bringer of dawn.
Let those of you with ears to hear hear.
Yes.
We sit upon the throne because of the mark of Cain.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Third, they foreswear their old name and are given a new one.
Then example is given.
Fourth, he makes them deny their godfathers and godmothers.
Both of baptism and confirmation.
And assigns them fresh ones.
We all get new names.
Isn't that nice?
Fifth, they give the devil some piece of their clothing.
For the devil is an eager is eager to make them his own in every particular of their spiritual goods.
He takes their faith and baptism.
Right.
You had that strip of the door when you came in here, you know, you know.
Yeah.
Of their bodily goods.
He claims just their blood.
As in the sacrifices to bail.
If you're going to perform the magic.
If you're going to crack open and enter this place.
Yeah, you got to be a son of God.
Yeah.
So.
The pig men.
How are the pig men doing?
The one thing the pig men learn is they learn the respect of the queen.
Right.
This is a place for Lady Babylon.
Yeah.
A holy place.
So the Amazonian that now runs the room.
I hope everything's going well to you, Cersei.
I hope everything's going well.
Please give people a chance.
Right.
Give people a chance before, you know, maybe around with the Alabasteren.
You know what I mean?
Then, you know, when they go over line there, have at it feast, feast.
Those who don't respect the queen.
That's what that's what happens.
You end up getting eaten, which must be a marvelous thing to do publicly.
Can you imagine eating, running down somebody and and turning them into some sort of kebab?
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's, yeah.
Third, fourth, he makes them deny their godfathers.
Yes.
Fifth, give the devil some piece of clothing in the baptism.
Six, they swear allegiance to the devil within a circle.
Yeah.
They swear allegiance to the devil within a circle.
Yes.
Hail Satan.
Right.
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
Yes.
Look, your contract.
It's not me.
I'm just the proxy.
Right.
Authorize to bring this to you.
Saint Isidore at Corp.
Yeah.
Seventh, they pray the devil to strike them out of the book of life and to inscribe them
in the book of death.
You didn't realize there was a difference, did you?
Yeah.
No, because this is not something they play up when we talk about the book of life.
And there are a few of you out there who will know what the book of life is.
Yes.
Yes.
Isn't it wonderful training that you received?
Bunch of lovely apostates.
I love it.
I love it.
It's a, it's quite a thing.
Oh, we also need to talk about, I feel like it'd be a little less formal during the Bible
studies and we also need to talk about victorious secret and Heracles.
We have a candidate to step up and proclaim himself a son of Heracles.
Yeah.
Heracles must show up in victorious secret, comfortably dressed in victorious secret.
Heracles wears the nightgown of the queen.
And this thing is, this thing is not cheap.
Yeah.
I would love for Mateus to design and produce this nightgown for Heracles.
I would love that.
I would love that.
Then he's welcome to sit in our arena and hold for truth that he's a child of Heracles.
Yes.
Yeah.
White wigs, white wigs.
When you can sit and you can chat comfortably in victorious secret and a blonde wig.
You are worthy of the apocalypse.
You are worthy of Jesus because that's how he shows up.
Yeah.
It's in the apocalypse.
Check it out.
Check it out.
He's wearing lingerie.
They call him morning store.
Yeah.
And all of a sudden did somebody, I felt something in Brazil.
We better get back in the timeship because I'm starting to, you know, there's only,
I only like to go to certain, you know, times.
Do I feel comfortable?
And I think we're starting to, we're starting to drift.
Let's go ninth.
They must every year make some gift to the demons, their masters to avoid being beaten by them.
Yeah.
I didn't.
We haven't talked about this one, but the entire shaving of the head and people have been asking
why the sharing of the head entering that phase of morning.
Yeah.
We are celebrating at this one time of year during what they call the lift gone.
The lift gone.
Yeah.
The Torah stands as the lift gone.
Yeah.
This mystery is gorgeous.
Isn't it?
It's, it's gorgeousness and gorgeosity all wrapped up.
They must make a gift, some gift once a year to appease their demon or what happens.
Yeah.
It's not good.
Right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'll let some of you read that who wants to, but let's go on the 10th.
He places his mark upon some part of their bodies.
His mark upon some part of your body.
Yeah.
Why does he do that?
Well.
Guazo.
Where does he put the mark?
Sometimes it's numb.
Yeah.
And you can't feel through it.
And sometimes it's in certain places.
You know, it's a little on men.
Yes.
It's generally found, you know, here and there.
Yeah.
Okay.
Guazo women.
It is found on the breast or private parts.
As has been observed by, and then he gets the names of the gentlemen, usually from an
order that will go into a community and pick up certain people that are suspected of certain
things, using certain substances, magic.
It's those sorcerers.
You know what I mean?
Those people are dangerous.
Yeah.
It's been observed by these investigators who, by the way, you read through the list of these
investigators and it's sad because they're all involved in like major slaughtering of
people.
It's one guy was like 900 whole group of women and children.
The last time I'd seen women and children destroyed in groups like that was when King
David did it.
Yeah.
I was, yeah.
Slaughter.
Why did he slaughter women and children in both cases?
They did it for the same reason.
To please the Lord.
Yeah.
To please the Lord.
Look at the one you serve.
Look.
Look at him.
If you're not sure yet, if you haven't broken through to reality, look at your God.
Look at him.
Yeah.
Look at the people and why they serve that God.
Oh, sacrifice.
There's usually the ones doing the very thing that they're broadcasting.
Right?
Yes.
They're usually the one committing the children to slaughter with the signs that say save the
children.
It's the same group.
Yes.
We walk among humans to observe these things.
We're the watchers.
Right.
The sons of God.
Yeah.
It's got to be Victoria's secret.
If you can show up in that kit with your hair done well and you know I'm talking about you.
Yeah.
That's the phase that you must enter or you're not legitimate.
It's not the son of God that we're talking about.
Yeah.
10th and then 11th when they have been.
This is just so when they show up, they can they can know that you've been completely informed.
I'm just doing what a good attorney does.
11th when they have been so marked, they make many vows as never to adore the Eucharist that
they will both and word indeed, he continual insults and revilings upon the blessed Virgin Mary.
It's the 11th.
Okay.
That they will trample upon and defile and break all the relics and images of the saints
and of everything associated with the kingdom of the pedophile.
That is our blasphemy.
We bring them the truth.
We bring them the reality.
We show them, show them the blood that you drink.
Guess where that comes from?
The money that you take to the charities.
Do you know where those goes to?
They go to men whom the less children.
Yes, they do.
And that is what you prop up.
Look.
Look at the lies that you support.
I'm speaking to allow Lady Babylon.
To feel comfortable.
Remember, the temple is a trap.
It's a place to open up.
Avoid in which a divinity is absorbed.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think your time is done because yes, look, I'm going over.
I'm going over.
So we have to, we have to mosey on what I'd like to do is now pull up for you.
I'd like to pull up a couple of Greek texts for you.
And I'm going to bring the first one up.
Julie.
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
And right away, the spirit.
Compelled him.
Ejected him.
What is going on?
We're with Jesus right after he meets with John and all John's boys out in the baptizing wilderness.
That's where we are.
Oh, and he sees that spirit and that spirit compels him into the air a month.
Into that place of solitude.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Where he's tempted.
Go ahead.
Give me the next one where he's tempted by the devil.
Yeah.
And he was there in this air a month for why 40 days.
What's he doing?
He's being pounded by satana.
He's being pounded by Satan.
Why?
Because he's in Satan's realm now.
Son of God, you think you're the son of God?
Show me.
Show me.
It's your time to step out.
Do you think you're there?
Do you see the mystery?
Do you see the mystery?
That's why Jesus shows up in the apocalypse with his shit off.
Excuse me.
YouTube with his gear on.
His lady wear.
He's already he's got his wig on his hair.
That white woolen hair.
There's a reason all of the vocabulary is connected.
Yeah.
Look at the context here.
Now we're back in first century.
Okay.
Oh, I don't see anything.
I see Greek.
I see Greek all over the place.
Here.
Where are we running to?
We're next.
Next passage.
Next passage.
Give me.
Give me going.
Oh, good.
Good.
This.
I want to bring this to you from Paul because you're going to be asking what's all the
baptism?
We're talking about magic.
What that?
What the who?
Bring it back up.
Oh my goodness.
Right.
Right.
We are buried with him through the baptism into death.
We are baptized into death.
You didn't know that.
Did you?
Did you?
You, you Baptist in the room.
You Baptist in the room.
You evangelicals.
Yeah.
You didn't know that that baptism into death is an ancient mystery.
Wow.
Didn't.
You're part of a fairy tale.
Yeah.
Yeah.
The original is so much more interesting.
It is seriously.
Seriously.
Okay.
We were in the, we were in the Eremon with Jesus after he's with.
Remember John's got these glasses that they is that are called the glass phallus.
Yeah.
With the boys.
Right.
This is Hercules.
We're there.
Oh, did I tell you that Hercules is always, always, always associated with a young boy
lover, just like Jehovah is by Joe.
If you say, yeah, maybe that's why I kicked out his wife.
Maybe.
Maybe that's why Jehovah kicked out his wife.
It could be cause trouble.
Just put the pieces together.
You know what I mean?
Just show it.
You know, it's not your honor.
This is not like, you know, like, you don't have to be smart to see that Jesus is a perv
and a garden that I know I'm telling them.
I'm telling them.
Let's keep going with the text.
This is intense.
I love this.
Thank you.
I hope you're all being spanked into conformity in that chat.
Yes.
Chat away.
Chat away.
Next great test.
Oh, back to the baptism into death.
I forgot, guys.
Look, look, look.
Why is he doing this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just as the Christos was raised, eknecron from that place where all the shades are from the
dead, from that place.
It's analog.
Remember the analog here.
Please don't get lost.
Yes.
Brilliant.
Yeah.
And through the doxa of his father, what happens to the doxa?
Through the doxa, right?
He is bringing us to a place to walk in this new life.
You are hearing the mystery.
You are hearing it again.
We are in a death and resurrection cult.
Yes.
Perhaps like the death and resurrection cults that involve the use of drugs and the use
of witches who have to give these drugs to induce the death that Guazzo is telling us
they can induce.
Wonderful.
There is your mark of Cain.
Yeah.
This is fantastic.
I love this.
Okay.
Let's keep going.
Back to the text.
Back to the text.
We're with Jesus, right?
We're with Jesus.
Go to the next one, please.
Fantastic.
Then Jesus was compelled.
He was led.
In that first line, that on eknecron is from onago.
And you have onago.
Chewie, bring up onago.
Yeah.
Look at this, people.
Look at this.
If you can see it real close, real close here.
Yeah.
To lead up from a lower place, right?
As opposed to catago.
Catago is to push down upon.
This one's to lead up.
Wait a minute.
Do I smell resurrection?
Do I smell resurrection?
Look at number four.
Bringing up, especially from the dead.
Ha, a spouse into the light.
It's the transition.
It's quantum physics from the ancient line.
Those of us who bought what the civil said about analog, we're able to follow.
Those of you who don't have ears to hear blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go back to the, back to the Greek.
Let's hurry up because the devil's supposed to show up, right?
We're performing magic.
Aren't we signing?
Don't we have signatures here?
I have so many signatures to collect tonight.
Yes.
So he's there for 40 days and 40 nights.
And the one who's, who's doing the trial comes and he says to him, if you are, you know,
here it is, you know, we're at Monty Python's bridge, right?
If you are the son of God, it's time to prove it.
This is formulaic.
This is formulaic.
It's no different than what you're going to see with Heracles.
Get your Victoria's secret.
Get your Victoria's secret on.
Heracles needs to stand up.
Are you the son of God?
Let's see what happens.
If you're all son of God, what?
Speak.
You want the magic?
Here it comes.
Speak.
So that these rocks become bread.
The trans, take it down.
The transmutation, the realigning, the binding.
That brings matter transfer is based in frame in mind.
Wow.
That, that's straight up Pythagorean crazy talk.
Right?
Totally.
Okay.
Anyway, back to our text.
And then give me the next one.
And then the devil took a hold of him, grabbed him by the collar and sent him to the, to
the holy city and put him on the spire and put him on the top, put him in the wings.
This is what it says.
Depending on the construction, be a different part of the building.
Anyway, put him up there.
Transport.
Look what he did.
Transport.
Yeah.
Transport.
Cross time and space.
That's gorgeous.
Love it.
And anyway, he said to him, if you're the son of God, here's number two.
That was strike one.
If you're the son of God, by the way, for those of you who realize that we're just reading
the Bible right now, you'll realize that Satan is indeed in control.
Isn't it nice?
Jesus gets yanked around question and yanked around.
Is he worthy of the throne?
Is he a son of God?
This is what happens when you mingle with the daughters of men.
Yes.
It's gorgeous.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Son of God, throw yourself down.
Now, and then the devil goes on the quote and he's just using a quote that he would
be familiar with because if you are the son of God, then this will happen.
You won't be able to kill yourself.
You won't give it a shot.
Yeah.
And Jesus backs again.
He doesn't take it.
Strike two.
Right?
Do you see the magic?
Yeah.
Follow the follow the line through the cave.
And then the devil took him to a high mountain and he showed to him.
What did he show to him?
It's on the next one.
No.
Next one.
That's yep.
We're good.
Look online.
Number three.
What did he show him?
He showed him toss Basileas.
And if you have noticed in Greek, Basilea can be a kingdom.
But it's the same word for queen.
It's funny.
Yes.
We don't say kingdom in antiquity.
We don't say kingdom.
We say kingdom.
Now, please, I just want.
I want to send a message.
Cross time and space into the mind.
Into the mind of Mary Beard.
I want her to be wherever she is.
Just maybe she's sleeping.
Probably sleeping right now.
I want her to wake up.
I want you to wake up, Mary.
And I want you to have been here with us.
And I want you to have seen that the very power in antiquity has a female root that women were not staying indoors.
It's called a kingdom.
Not a kingdom for a reason.
Logically, because we have queens.
Oh, well, that explains all the ancient queens.
Yeah.
So much for the staying indoors.
We can't tolerate garbage here in this temple.
We can't.
Yeah.
I would like to give you a little video.
And then I'm just going to finish up.
And I just want you to see this little video.
Because it highlights the magic and analog for you.
For those of you with ears to hear.
You will take that then.
And you will be able to form the pact.
And to sit on the throne.
Yeah, to bear the mark.
Video.
Long before goodbyes are said.
Long before goodbyes are said.
And I can see the end from here.
I can see the end from here.
And it's coming this way past.
It won't be long until tomorrow is in the past.
That's what you need.
I'm going to start a Saturday.
Class.
On necromancy.
It will be half.
Half an hour.
Of.
Hardcore intensive Greek.
And half an hour.
Of Greek necromancy texts.
Yeah, and if anybody is interested.
They're welcome to come.
They're welcome to come.
And I want you people who have already expressed interest in coming.
And I know those of you who will be coming.
I want you to bring your book along with you.
If you don't have it this week, you can have it next.
But this is the second edition of the Hanson and Quinn.
Intensive Greek that they taught us at Berkeley.
When I did the intensive Greek session there.
Half of our class will be working out.
The other half will be.
Shooting the vapor is necromancy.
And I want to put a warning on the class that will be on discord.
And I want to put a warning.
That.
I'm going to require that you have a strong stomach.
That this will all be unfiltered.
And that we will, I will take you some places that.
Yeah, that will give you a.
Give you the images that you need.
By the way, Jesus is a necromancer.
Did I forget to put that detail on there?
Yeah, he's a necromancer.
And if you line up the language, the Greek side by side with the text, he's a.
He's one of them.
That's why they showed up like paid for his education and eat with all.
Right.
Because he's a necromancer.
That's how they work it.
All right.
The Magi.
Love it.
You see the phoniness that you have inherited.
You think of the Magi and you have every one of you know, has been by the church.
When they have their little plays, their little plays and clay and.
Little statues and they bring them out.
Some of those statues are sacred to those people.
Right.
And they have the three wise guys.
Yeah, they have them there.
And yeah, and the gold.
Right.
Right.
It's fantastic.
Necromancy.
Not just for the brave anymore.
Yeah.
Good stuff.
Good stuff.
That's why they call them Sybilis.
We need to see that world.
If we're going to solve the.
The question of what Jesus was doing.
What Jesus was doing.
You can watch by the accusations of his working with Bell's Abul.
That he is working from bail.
And that he is doing his.
Necromancy magic.
For the orific resurrection.
Delightment of his audience.
If he could have only gotten that.
Antidote when he was.
In the.
