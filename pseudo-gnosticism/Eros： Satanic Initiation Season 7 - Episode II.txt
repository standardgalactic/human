You asked for it.
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave on the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a star coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed all the way
Why did you ever change your name all the way?
Why did you ever change your name?
Welcome back to the final season of Lady Babylon's Satanic initiation.
It's nice to have you back.
I've been talking to so many of you lately
And I just can't tell you how much I appreciate.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate all the time that we've spent together.
Every moment I can feel you.
And I get some of those emails and I think,
My goodness, how fortunate I am.
How fortunate I am to be in your company.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I'm going to take you right into Epsilon.
We saw Alpha in our last series of seven.
We will progress through right through those spheres.
Those harmonic spheres will progress right through them.
We went through Alpha.
We saw the burial.
We come to Epsilon.
We take ourselves into the wilderness.
Today on Lady Babylon's Satanic initiation,
I want to invite you.
I want to invite you to Jesus.
I want you to see him and I want you to see all the drugs that are involved.
Today, I want you to have that antiquity.
It is what we inherited.
It is ours.
Welcome to Lady Babylon.
Before we begin, I want to tell you that tomorrow I will be on forbidden knowledge news.
And it's an interview that I'm very much looking forward to.
I appreciate the chance to be able to do that.
Tonight, I'm going to be prepping and I'm not going to have time for discord.
I apologize, but I'm not going to shift some of my work that I've got for tomorrow to this evening.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
I don't want to waste your time.
I want to go right into it and you know what we have to do.
You know what we have to do.
Are you in that throne?
Oh, I can feel it.
I can feel it.
Good.
We have to start with a cleansing.
This is all purgation.
Welcome to the apocalypse.
It's all purgation.
Let's get on it before we come to those texts and remember people.
Keep this scientific.
We don't care about ideas.
We don't care about values.
We don't care about morals.
We care about evidence.
That's it.
We are scientists of the purest strain.
I will wash that dark blood right out of you.
I'll bring it right out of you.
It's a purgation.
Tonight, in order to achieve this, do you smell sulfur?
I smell sulfur.
In order to achieve this, we're going to bring Eros.
Yeah.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.
You thought for a minute it was the baby, didn't you?
He thought it was.
I want you to see Eros as sons of Venus, daughters of Aphrodite.
I want you to see Eros through that lens from antiquity.
That is what we're bringing tonight.
That is that Epsilon.
That is that Epsilon.
Let's go to our first passage.
Bring it up.
This is going to be a little controversial.
I'm going to start off with the hot stuff.
Are you guys ready?
I watched somebody sent me a video this week and said,
hey, look at this guy talking about porneia.
And he was, you know, could I smell it?
I watched it and I smelled.
I was like, what's this guy all about?
And he was a seminarian.
I could smell it.
They got that.
He got that seminarian smell to him.
You know what I mean?
People can tell that.
The seminarians are going to lead you down a path, porneia.
He's going to define the porneia.
The only thing I want to say is you come out
through going down a rabbit hole and coming up
through the other side of the globe.
You're in a different dimension of morality.
What is porneia?
Fornication.
Fornication.
Oh, and it's idolatry.
Yes, it's idolatry.
And this was the debate back and forth.
The only thing I'm telling you is,
while our ship is getting primed here to get us back
to our destination, you've got to know the world sees
this material through a corrupted lens.
It sees it through a bent lens.
We have to go back to that original to find it.
And how is it so bent?
How is it so bent?
It is bent through eros.
Yeah.
When you try to change nature, you end up bending things.
Fantastic.
Let me show you exactly what I mean.
Bring up the, you want to see what porne is.
Porne, right?
When I say porne, I'm talking about a Greek root.
Get your dirty, don't be dirty.
Everybody here, come on, man.
This is civilized, right?
Porne is a Greek root, right?
Porne is a Greek root.
And we know, they'll say, what is porne?
And they'll say, oh, prostitute, prostitute, right?
Can I tell you how many words there are for prostitutes
and how many shades there are?
Look at Hesechius that we've got here on the left people.
I'm not going to give you any of my ideas.
I'm going to give you Hesechius, right?
Pornamen.
Look at that first one.
He puts polaine underneath it.
That's to sell, to enter into merchandising.
Polaine.
You got merch?
You know what you say?
You know what an ancient Greek who invents democracy hears?
When you say merch, he hears you are selling your orifices.
Love that.
How about this one?
How about this for good old fashioned morality?
You see what happens when the Christians
denied the gods, those atheist Christians.
When they denied the gods, they took all of this with them.
It's terrible.
Look what we've got here.
Pornamenai.
Uh-oh.
Kentuminai, those are the people who have been stung.
What is a porne?
Somebody who's been stung and who is entering into the commerce.
Wait, you have to be stung?
Yeah, if you don't know what I'm talking about,
you haven't been there.
You haven't been there at the pocket.
You're going to love it.
Are you ready?
Look at the next one underneath that.
Porniocopos.
What is that?
It's a hetira trough that he tells you underneath.
It's somebody who supports a hetira.
What is that hetira?
That's the person that you support who supports you
with the arts of Aphrodite.
Does that make sense?
Yes, you support them back.
You give them support, right?
So that's what you're engaging in there.
That's what you're engaging in.
Give us one more time.
Give us that.
Oh, look at the bottom one.
And by the way, it says pornos for that last one.
Now look at the bottom one, pornoi.
What is that?
It's paidi oraioi.
Show them the next one just to blow it up,
just so you guys can see this.
And I hope that the evangelicals out there
who are talking about this on YouTube, I hope, I hope,
please tell me they will come and see this.
Look, pornoi.
These are paidi oraioi.
What does it take it down?
What is a pornos?
It is a child who is at the bloom at the perfect ripeness.
And you say, oh, cleanse my ears.
Cleanse my ears.
Do you feel, do you feel a little bit of taste
in the back of your mouth, right?
Because that's gross.
I mean, it's just, it's creepy gross, right?
Hang on before you jump off the ship.
You're sailing on the SS Virgin Mary.
Yeah, this is who we're talking about.
The SS Virgin Mary is a ship full of a tiraioi.
Did you wonder why they auctioned her off?
Did they wonder why they auctioned
the Blessed Mother of Christ?
Did you wonder why they auctioned her off?
Oh, it was whoever got luckiest.
Yeah, casting her light.
The guys went running down.
Thank you to the cops for bringing us this.
The guys went running down.
Did you hear?
They're giving away the Virgin.
She's the one who's been in the temple.
This is Jewish practice.
If you're not up with this, you know, sorry.
But it's Jewish practice.
And Mary's out there.
They got her.
She's 12 years old.
And you know why she looks the way she does?
Because she's been nourished by God in the inner sanctum.
It was angels that were giving it to her.
Angels.
Angels.
OK.
Do you see anthropologically what's going on?
Fine.
Let's hit another text.
Here we go.
I just want to put kenteo here up the verb.
And I want you to notice it means to be stuck, to be jabbed,
or to be bineo at the bottom.
And what is that bineo?
Uh-oh.
It means to inire.
Oh, look, they're so.
Victorians were so sly.
They were so worried about sex that they had to put crosses
in the form of funny words.
Crosses.
They're censoring, right?
What?
You're using the Latin to translate the Greek.
That's not fair.
That's not fair.
It's not fair.
But what does inire mean?
If you know Latin, you know what goes in and comes out.
And goes in and comes out.
Goes in and comes out.
Boom, boom, boom.
Can you hear the drums?
Boom, boom, boom, boom.
And you hear it.
Boom, boom, boom.
Right, eros.
Can you feel eros?
Oh, God.
It's purification, people.
It's purification.
Most people don't know that eros.
As a matter of fact, anybody out there from Harvard,
those knuckleheads, the knuckleheads in the ivory tower
of knuckleheadery, they don't realize
because they don't delve into the text.
They don't dig down to those fragments.
They don't find that mystery where it lies.
They won't go to the sciences.
They won't go.
Shame on you guys.
You won't go.
But eros there is that purification.
If you ask them, what is eros?
Oh, ask somebody.
OK?
And then forget what they say.
Eros is the lover of the human soul.
He brings purification.
Eros is the lover of the human soul.
He brings purification.
For the orphics, this is prime.
Do you have a problem with eros being winged?
Do you have a problem with him being the winged dragon?
Do you have a problem with him being the bright morning star?
Oh, my goodness.
You say eros is Venus?
Eros is Aphrodite?
Oh, sons and daughters of Venus.
Are there any of you out there?
Sons and daughters of Venus?
Yes.
This is the stuff.
This is the stuff that floated the oracles
and the stuff that forms the empire.
This is the Bacchic backbone that we're talking about right
here.
Eros, where does Bacchus always lead us?
Leads us straight to her.
Straight to her.
Oh, God.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
OK, I need some fascinating stuff to help people out.
And immediately getting up, coming out of the water,
what happened?
He saw the uranus.
He saw it.
Opened up.
Right now, this is the uranus.
Most of you will think this is Jesus and Mark,
getting baptized by John.
And he comes out of the water.
And we see these pictures in Sunday school.
We had, oh, here comes the dove, right?
Coming out of the sky.
This is right before he goes into the Eremon.
Not the topos, but the Eremon.
He goes into the void.
Are you ready to go into the void with Jesus?
Come here, kiddies.
Let's follow Jesus right into the void.
What happens when he comes out of the water?
Aiden, he saw.
What did he see?
What did he see?
Because the rest of us are looking around like, what?
What did he see?
He looks up into uranus.
And he sees descending from the plenum, the spirit of God.
Do you know how to get high in Christianity and Judaism?
It's via the pnellma, by that spirit.
When you're sitting there as one of the sons of Aaron, right?
And you're doing your thing.
When you're one of the Levites and you're coming forward
to do your thing, you're standing at that altar
with the enclosed tent around you.
You're sucking in that vapor that's
coming off the burnt offering.
And you've got that rope around your leg,
and it's tied there so that if you fall over,
they can pull you out before you die.
When you're surfing those spaces like that,
you are entering that void.
And it's from that void that the voice comes.
You know why they're always trying
to bring the voice of God to some kind of tent?
They're trying to bring him in and have him.
Look, he's going to speak, right?
It's only for special sacred people, right?
OK, let's go.
That's the party that we've all come to tonight.
Can you feel it?
It's the reality of the story that we've been told.
Let's go to the next one.
Go to the next one.
Oh, yeah, and that spirit came on.
Anyway, and phony, that's OK.
And there was a voice, right?
There was a voice from the heavens.
And you ask yourself, why is this plural?
In all the translations, they're just
going to translate it, heaven.
Because everything in English blows, yeah, heaven.
They're going to translate it.
No, it's a plural, a plurality.
It's a plurality.
Do you remember Paul, the apostle, getting high,
pushing that thorn, pushing that thorn in the flesh,
getting that snake high?
Do you remember him doing that?
You know Karson at the Pythia?
Because he is Christing, and she's
telling the world about it.
Yeah, yeah, drug use and junkie Paul.
He was even embarrassed about it himself.
So where are we at?
Go back to Mark.
What does Jesus say?
So from the heavens comes out.
Paul went to these places.
He went to the third or the seventh.
I always forget which number.
I'm terrible with numbers.
But Jesus, from those zones, is able to draw that pnellma,
and he's hearing a voice.
And we're all standing around looking at Jesus
and his Baptists getting nuts, getting high,
and hearing things.
He's going to go off into the Eremon.
Look at this.
What does it say?
And a voice.
And there was this voice from the heavens.
And what did it say?
Yeah, you are my lovely or beloved son.
Yeah, in whom I'm the champ, bro.
I'm the champ, right?
He hears Daddy's voice coming from the split within the heavens.
Are you looking up?
If you're looking up for a dove, painting a picture,
where's the dove?
Look at some of the stupid portraits
that come out of the Byzantine world.
Look at that stupid stuff that comes out with respect to this.
It looks, not only does it look fairy tale,
it's just unbelievably bad.
Classical art, when the classical world was overthrown,
the art was sucked out the backside of the world.
I can say that because I'm free to say that to you.
There's no professor on the planet that will tell you this.
But Christianity killed Western art.
It killed it.
Killed it dead.
You ever seen what it produced in its place?
They look like zombie people.
Yeah, they look like zombie people.
We went as humanity.
We went from a place of knowing eros.
We went from a place of worshiping Aphrodite.
We went from that place.
We went from that place to a place of looking
at men who look like zombies in cloaks that don't show the body.
They hung crosses on everything.
They killed your art.
And for 1,000 years, you entered the Dark Ages.
When you finally climbed out of the pit
through the Renaissance, you got your bearings back.
There's a constant tide coming to wash away.
Civilization, whether it was the Greeks when
they were holding the football, or whether it was the Romans
when they were holding the football,
or whether it's you and I holding the football,
that civilization is in our hands.
Yeah, and there's always a force against it.
Let's keep going.
People didn't like that I brought up
things about world happenings.
I only have to say that.
There's a certain element at the present
that must be injected to make this worth your time.
Go.
Let's hit the next one.
Love it.
Mark 1, 1.
Yeah, this great boy.
Yeah, let's go on.
So the voice is speaking.
But why we even mention this?
And immediately, the plumber, the spirit, throw him.
It literally, boom.
You know how all these guys get high in the Bible
and see visions?
They do it as they said themselves
through the Pnellma, through that spirit, through that air.
Have you ever been with Amogus?
And he's caught that air.
And he's in that place where he can see the things
that you can't.
Yeah, that's what we're talking about.
Jesus gets the Pnellma.
Now, I will just say from experience,
because I've been hounded by Charismatics.
Charismatics love to come and pray demons away.
For some reason, I attract them.
Can you believe that?
I think it's my good looks, but it may be something else.
Anywho, this whole demon possession thing, right?
That is the power that is controlled.
When you have that Pnellma of God,
that's when you get to step out of that chronic world
into what's the Ionic.
The Ionic is what you modern day Christians
translate as eternal.
And it's totally wrong.
And you don't know what you're talking about, which is sad,
because you originally did, and your people
did a much better job when they were all using the drugs
and entering the orgies.
These are sex rights people.
Did you wonder why we're talking about a virgin?
We don't sacrifice a virgin.
We don't sacrifice the virgin.
Are you kidding?
She's the source of our medicine.
Don't be stupid, right?
But if she says somebody else should be sacrificed,
that's different, right?
Because we entrust that power.
We entrust that power to the God,
because you see all of this is built upon possession.
People ask about possession.
Oh, I'm sorry.
OK, we're almost.
People ask about possession, and they think, oh, my goodness.
This is a weird esoteric topic.
No, no, no.
It is the driving force of classical mystery,
the driving force.
It's a central element.
When Jesus comes to Mary and casts out her seven demons,
what do you think he came here to do?
To exert control, command over those forces.
Fantastic.
Hence the boys, right?
You need the boy for the Jesus.
He's going to be doing the Christing and chasing the demons
and commanding the power of Beelzebul.
He's going to be using this magic.
OK, let's go.
There's the next test.
And so the spirit threw him.
Now watch this, people.
I'm going to prove to you right now.
And this is not a heady argument.
I'm just going to point out to you.
These last three words in this sentence
are a prepositional phrase.
Into the Eremon, right?
Into what's translated as desert, wilderness, or void.
Into the void.
Now, people think this is a place, a location here on Earth.
He walked out into the Judean desert.
No, how do we know that for a fact?
Because when that desert is an actual location,
give me the next one, you're going
to see Mark himself invest in a word that, well, it's
the next one, but wait.
Yeah, go to the next one, this one, that one.
You're going to see Mark use a word to explicitly express
that this is a location.
And that is the second word on the second line, top on place.
Notice that it's right next to Eremon.
Because at this time, Jesus and his buddies
go off by themselves.
And by buddies, I mean all of his children that he's with.
They go, we know, right?
Did you know the apostles were all teenagers?
Yeah, you didn't.
And then I told you, you know now, so let's go on.
OK, so he's taking his boys off for a lunch break.
Because it says on the bottom line,
he didn't have any time to eat, bro.
He's getting bothered by people.
And so what happens?
What happens?
He gets sent into the, he says, hey, let's go.
Take a lunch break.
Go off into the place, the Eremon.
So this is very specific.
Mark is not talking.
When Mark says, Jesus went into the wilderness
to meet with the devil, to be tried of the devil,
he's not going to a taffos, a place.
He is going into the void, which is what we do when we
participate in the mysteries.
Do you see why we all come out of it, demon possessed?
It's a process.
It's a process.
It's an anthropological process, a place for you
to get your mind to.
A place for you to get your mind to.
Good.
Let's go to the next one.
We've got to hustle through some of these sources here.
No, I won't hustle people.
I'll treat you good, I promise.
But I got a lot of good stuff.
Look at this.
Oh, who are the people who are going
to enter into the Hothanatos Hodeuteros?
The second death.
Now, remember, take it down for a minute.
The second death, when Adonis dies,
he leaves Aphrodite.
And he is welcomed on the other side while she mourns.
He is welcomed.
We are going into the void with Adonis,
for those of you with ears to hear.
He goes into the void.
Now, flip your polarity around.
You're no longer with Aphrodite mourning the dead Adonis.
You're with the Korah, the queen of the underworld.
And what are you doing?
He's coming.
He's coming back.
He is resurrecting, but he's going the opposite direction.
This is the second death.
And this is what those of us who participate
in the mystery of Anomia, this is what we pursue.
We pursue the second death.
Bring that back up.
And do you know what kind of people
are involved in the second death?
These are the people, these wretched apistois,
these wretched, faithless people, right?
No, we don't need faith.
You don't need faith.
When you're in the second death, you don't need faith, right?
You got a whole pharmacology to back you up, right?
We'll take you right there into the second death.
Imagine a cult where people were being purposely
put into a death state and then resurrected.
Why?
Because Adonis, the pole has switched.
And Adonis is now entering the underworld.
And when he enters, we celebrate a marriage.
We celebrate a marriage.
Do you think Eros has power only over the air?
Now, he has power over that dark matter that
makes up the under, that makes up that void.
He has power there.
Isn't that amazing?
You know, the only thing that can never be conquered
in the mind of an orific, the power of Eros, unconquerable.
Oh, God, you got to love it.
OK, let's go back.
Let's go back.
You thought Jesus was going into a wilderness.
I think that's hilarious.
OK, watch what happens here.
Who are these people?
Look at the second line.
They're murderers.
They're murderers.
And what else are they?
They're what?
They're pornois.
Anybody got a kid in the bloom of his youth around here?
I know one guy that did.
I know one guy that had a naked kid with him in a public park
when he was arrested.
Do you know who was arrested, children, in a public park
with a naked boy?
I'll tell you who was arrested in a public park
with a naked boy.
Jesus Christ, child of the Virgin,
he was arrested in a public park with a naked boy.
Could he have been a member?
Could he have been involved?
Did he ever say anything about your honor?
Overruled.
Did he ever say anything about resurrection?
Do you remember it?
Anyone want to step forward?
Because that's what all this second death cult does.
Yeah.
Death resurrection.
Death resurrection.
In order to get involved in it, you have to be Christed.
You have to be Christed.
It's something they call the water of life.
And remember Jesus went around flexing it that he got it.
If you'd asked me, lady at the well, who you know,
you know what was going on.
If you'd asked me, he said, she blew him off.
And he said, if you'd asked me, I'd
have given you the aqua wita, aqua witai, the water of life.
I've given it to you.
Well, you got access to that, she says?
You got access?
Yeah, Jesus with his 12 boys, he's got access.
Let's look at the drugs some more.
Can you feel it?
It's a little unsettling.
Thank you for staying, people.
Thank you for staying.
Who else are these people?
They're not only these pornois, these prostitute children.
They're also pharmacois.
They're people who use the farmaca, baby.
Right?
Did Jesus use the farmaca?
Damn straight he did.
Yes.
Oh, God.
He wouldn't have been able to be called the Christ that
one if he wasn't.
Yeah, he was into it.
Love it.
Love it.
Let's go to the next one.
Boom.
And finally, and he, you know, so he says, look,
this is, everything has come to boom.
Is that the gag going on?
This is how it is.
Boom.
So I'll come down to this.
Boom.
Eagle to alpha, kite to omega.
Yeah, I'm that beginning and that end, right?
And I'm going to give to the one.
I'm going to give to the one who's got the dipsass, who's
got the thirst.
I'm going to give him from the pege from the fountain
of that water that comes from Zoe.
Zoe, keep that in mind.
I want you to keep that in my Zoe.
We know who Zoe is.
Don't you know?
Didn't you know the water of life came from Eve?
Boy, you're confused now.
Did you not get an invitation to the fruit?
What happens?
Things get mixed up in the mail, I guess.
I want to go to the next one, please.
I want to take you now to a horse quickly.
OK, if you'll give me 20 more minutes,
I'll give you the best material that I can conjure right now.
Look at line.
I'm just going to hit you to the great points.
Look at line five.
This is in the Geoponica, Byzantine,
agricultural slash drug slash all sorts
of zoological stuff manual by a dude calling himself Zoro
Aster, this section is.
And in number five, he says, Hippos Rupaluku,
Brothes Agathos Estai, Kai Podokes.
Now, it's kind of strange the way that it's phrased.
But it fits in with all the rest of the description
that he provides perfectly.
He's being instances between sympathy and antipathy
and how they work in the universe.
And he says, the horse that is bitten by the wolf,
the horse that is bitten by the wolf, what happens to them?
They'll be good.
And they will be fast, fast.
Wait, what the horse that is bit by the Lukos?
He goes on to say, look at the next line.
He says, yeah, and Pamphilus says, in his bit on nature,
he says that the horses that walk in the wolf's path
ride, that enter that path of the wolf,
that they, what happens to them?
Oh, that they narcotize their legs.
They narcotize their legs.
They get faster walking in that path.
And what is that Lukos?
People, I'm about to give you a priest.
I'm going into full hierophant.
You have to be a hierophant to hear this stuff.
Watch what happens.
We're going to the next one.
Here's our wolf, right?
What is it, what is the, what kind of, look at, wow,
what does it say, number 10?
At the very bottom, Orobache.
Wait, and then it gives diascortes.
Remember that I mentioned that just briefly?
What is it that the horse is doing?
What is it, he's involved in harvesting some kind of
bachic fruit?
He's involved in, yes, the priest Nicander talks about this.
Turns out your horses are faster if they're bachic.
Now, wait a minute.
Your horses are faster if they're bachic.
And they don't seem to have any pain in their legs.
Yeah, I guess you can run for a real long time.
Yeah, bachic horses, I wish I had bachic horses.
How much would I love to have bachic horses?
Let's go on to the next one to see where this trail is going.
Let's go to the priest.
Let's go to the priest that mentions this drug.
And he mentions it in the context of his theriac,
of his theriac.
Do you remember who is with Jesus?
Take it down for a second.
Do you remember who was with Jesus when he goes into the
Eremon?
Here's your epsilon, are you ready?
Who is with Jesus, the Anguloid?
They serve him.
They serve him.
They deacon him.
They serve him.
And who else is there?
Nobody ever notices this, right?
It's so ridiculous.
It ends up so stupid in the Christian paintings.
It's stupid.
The therion come to him.
The therion, what are those beasts?
Oh, let's draw some animals and let's draw Jesus out there
with them.
Maybe we can do a Mel Gibson and put him in some kind of
situation, have some snake crawl out there.
Be really cool, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
You don't even realize that the dude is in a state, is in a
high, where he is using the drugs to project his vision
into the ion.
You want to know why he needs those beasties there to
listen to the angels?
Because he ain't hearing or seeing any angels unless he
is stoned out of his brain on those serpents.
This is a serpent cult.
When he tells his children, his lamkins, when he tells his
lamkins, you can drink this stuff that'll kill you, this
Thanasimon drug.
You can drink it.
It's from snakes and it won't hurt you.
He's going to show us how to do that.
Those of you who are sitting in church today, who are going
to churches, who will be in churches, who are sitting
there, all of the snakes are gone.
But the snakes were central.
Why do you think she has seven stars in her hand?
Why do you think the formula is composed of those seven plus
all the other ingredients?
It's a look.
It's a mystery.
You are part of it.
You've never been initiated.
I've been born again.
No, you haven't.
You have not.
Let me issue this challenge to the Christians tonight.
And those of you who have seen, those of you with eyes to
see, who have seen the reality, you've seen Jesus with
naked boy.
Maybe this is something you could step up with.
Next time they try to ram them down your throat, tell them,
give me the snakes.
Give me the snake venom.
I want to know what my Lord and Savior was doing with that
naked boy.
I guarantee you, if you tell your Christian relative this,
it's going to end the conversation.
It's going to end the conversation.
I, right now, am trying to figure out how to bring this
information to the public in a way that they won't just walk
away as soon as they hear it, because that's what happens.
It happens in regular conversation, and it happens
in interviews.
You start talking about Jesus as naked kid.
You start talking about Paul being a junkie.
You start talking about John with his penis-shaped cup.
You start talking ancient bonk at ritual, and people get
scared, and they run.
They run.
So we have to have a platform to bring this to people so
that they can see it.
They have to be able, it's the museum.
We've got to bring it back.
Let's go.
I'm taking, I want to take you to the priest here.
I just want you to look at the first two lines here.
Look at the first two lines.
Yeah, we're talking about a kid now.
We're talking about vipers, these terrible biding vipers,
right?
And so this is kind of sandwiched in the work of a priest
of Apollo.
And you say, what is a priest of Apollo?
Pion, right?
Pion the healer.
Did you ever wonder why the Christ is the great physician?
Did you ever wonder that?
Jesus was a doctor.
Where did he get his dead?
Was he down in Egypt, went to medical school?
Where's my whip?
Let's whip it out of him.
Jesus, did you go to medical school in Egypt, Jesus?
He keeps quiet all the time.
He's no fun, man.
You can smack him, and smack him, and smack him.
And he just kisses, sits there quiet.
I don't get it.
I don't get it.
But it's hard to get answers out of him, right?
Jesus is a quiet fellow when it comes to necromancy.
But that's OK.
We've got enough on the record of what he already said
to put him away forever.
You know what I mean?
So OK, let's go.
Let's bring it to that second of those, this one.
Look, I'm going to give you a secret,
because you've come tonight.
Here is a secret within a secret that you're supposed
to be picking up from the epsilon.
Here is a secret within a secret.
It's like a commercial within a show.
Here we go.
Look at the bottom two lines halfway across,
and then, everybody recognize Oduseius there, as Odysseus,
right?
F-thito, leogaleo, tupeis, haliu, cupo, chentru.
You know what that means?
Go ahead and take it down.
That is a Hellenistic priest of Apollo, who is the physician,
the holy physician, who knows the Christ.
He knows what that is.
He knows that category of drugs.
And so he's going to be piling into his poetry
a whole bunch of stuff.
And he's writing to another priest from somewhere else.
So there's mystery, religion.
There's more Christianity in this guy who is before Christianity.
There's more Christianity in this text
than there is in the New Testament, 10 times over.
The raw anthropology is all there.
He says, hey, you know what really happened to Odysseus?
And this is why Jesus has to be the pion, the healer,
the divine physician, because of the capacity
to do exactly this, what he's doing,
to be able to step forward and to be able to push
that son of God to the place that they need to be.
Bring us what happens to Odysseus.
Are you ready?
He dies.
And how does he die?
Well, people don't know it, but this priest is telling you.
Those of us who were in the know know
that Odysseus died from pushing that poison.
He was like Paul.
He was addicted.
And he was pushing that poison to get to the seventh heaven.
How do we know that about Odysseus?
How do we know that he's a junkie?
We have Odysseus the first time he ever appears to us in Homer.
He's out looking for the arrow poison.
He's out looking for it.
Other people don't want to give it to him.
The guy finds he doesn't want to give it to him.
It's too dangerous.
You're going to kill yourself with this stuff.
Guess what says Nicander?
He did.
He did.
And that stuff is so strong.
If you don't have the right theory act,
it's going to kill you.
You're going to be dead.
But this is what the people go through.
Everybody in the congregation tonight,
this is what people go through in order
to get into the right in order to come through that initiation
and then in order to sustain that Holy Spirit.
In order to bring that Holy Spirit, how do you think Paul
made it up into the third, fourth, fifth, sixth heaven?
How do you think he made it up there?
He made it with this process, with the mystery.
He made it with this launchpad of the compound drugs.
They're all there in the text.
The languages, they're screaming, screaming,
but we don't hear it, right?
We don't hear it.
Why?
Because we've been through the dark ages.
This knowledge has been kept from you
in order to construct a false image that
would control you.
I know that sounds like we're living in the matrix.
I know it does.
Yeah, and I can't deny it.
I can't deny it.
That is what people do when they rewrite history,
when they appropriate, when there is no visible record
and you have to take traditions to yourself.
It's what cultures do.
They appropriate what is valuable
and what is most valuable.
I'm going to say this tonight.
I know that you guys have heard this maybe before,
but I'm going to say it tonight.
Humanity reached its linguistic apex with ancient Greek.
All languages are not created equal.
Greek came and survived and expanded and developed
and destroyed other languages that
were too weak for the onslaught.
Those languages were holding people back.
We, as human beings, evolved a capacity
to expand our own minds, our vision,
to get our brain to develop and to fire
on all of the receptors that it's got,
all of those receptors for Asterian,
all of those receptors, those opiates,
all of those receptors, all of those compounds,
those proteins that come from the snake venoms,
that work upon your hormones, yeah, yeah, huh, yeah,
all of that designed to bring you a virgin.
That's the mystery and that virgin has the water of life
and she won't be here unless we produce her.
That's Lady Babylon and that is what the Christians
are so afraid of.
She is the enemy.
The devil's not.
He doesn't take center stage.
The dragon doesn't take, not even the beast, the antichrist.
They're all foils.
What are they foils for, Lady Babylon?
Let's go to the last text.
I want to bring you, I want you just to sit here.
I'm going to translate this thing really quick
and I want you to pretend that you are in this banquet.
We've come back to the late Bronze Age.
We're looking at Homer here, right?
So people who talk to you on YouTube and say,
oh, the Greek says this and the Greek says that.
There's people who talk about knowing Greek
and there's people who actually translate Greek.
Let's look at what happens here.
So there's a banquet going on.
I'll just set it up by saying there's a banquet going on
and we've all been crying in mourning, right?
Just know it, the audience, we've all been crying in mourning.
This has been some sad stuff going on.
So I'll start translating.
So Helen, the daughter of God,
the begotten of God.
Did you hear that?
You knew there was a son of God in the world,
but you didn't know that there was a daughter of God.
That doesn't even register on your brains.
Look how dull your brains are.
That that doesn't even register.
When I say son of God, people perk up.
Son of God, son of God.
When I say daughter of God, nobody hears it.
Well, here it is.
Helen, the son of God, the daughter of God.
What does she do?
She puts a drug into the wine and this thing,
they drank it then.
It's a napenthe.
It's a complete dissolver of pain and it's acholon.
It makes your attitude so that you're not angry.
Oh, cool.
It's a mood.
It's a modifier of your mood.
And yeah, yeah, yeah.
And it does what?
It makes you forget.
It's an epilatheic.
It's an epilatheon.
It is something that makes you forget
all of the bad that has happened to you.
So much so that whoever takes it,
now listen to this, you've come to the party
and you're gonna take this drug, right?
It's in the wine.
We're gonna get bockock.
And what are we gonna do, right?
Whoever takes it, when it's mixed into the wine,
what in the mixing vessel, what happens?
What happens for an entire 24 hour period?
This person's not gonna shed any tears.
Not even if his mother and his father die
right in front of him.
Not even if somebody takes out the bronze blade
and kills his brother or his most loved son, right?
Not even if he sees it with his own eyes.
Will he shed a tear?
This is the power that the daughter of God has
in the form of her drugs that are clever
and bringers of good.
This art was taught, was brought to us by Polly Domna.
She's the wife of Thon.
Who is this Thon guy?
Who gives it?
Who cares?
Thon didn't do anything in history.
Thon didn't do jack.
Thon was sitting around picking his backside, right?
But what did she do?
What did Thon's wife do?
Polly Domna.
What did she do?
She created all these drugs, man.
And where did she get it?
Well, you know how it works.
The Zedoros earth brought it to her in Egypt, right?
She's an Egyptian.
The Zedoros.
What is the Zedoros?
I just want you to see this.
Go to the last, what is something that Zedoros?
Zee giving.
Look everybody, look at this.
What is this?
Zee giving.
Does anybody know what that means?
Zee giving, and it's used of earth.
And look at number two, Roman numeral two.
Some authors derived it from Za'o.
Rides, that living principle.
Za'o, we get Zoe, it's the same root.
And meaning life, forgiving, right?
And it's used of Aphrodite.
Aphrodite, the life giver.
Aphrodite, isn't that gorgeous?
How do you have your love?
How do you have your eros?
You have it with the she who brings life.
Oh God, isn't that gorgeous?
But it's even deeper than that.
You still haven't gotten to the bottom.
Show me the next one.
Oh God, watch this people.
Watch this, Za'o.
Look at what it means.
It means to ferment, right?
To get hot.
To get hot and ferment.
Do you know what Aphrodite does?
She gets hot and she ferments.
She bubbles up.
She bubbles up and she boils over.
She boils over.
And in that sense, she exhales or she ejaculates, right?
And it's that essence of Aphrodite
that is the resurrection mystery.
Why are the Christians, take it down.
Why are the Christians warning you
not to hang out with the people who are using the drugs
and who are involved in the sex and the temple worship
with the children?
Why not be involved with these people?
Yeah, why not be involved with these idolaters?
Because they were.
If they're having to root that out in the early church,
it means they were.
It means it's an integral part of Christianity.
It's the reason.
We just found the reason that Jesus,
when he's arrested, screams out,
I am not a trafficker.
I am not a child trafficker.
These drugs that they're using within the cult
maintain control.
Imagine this people just for a second
and I'll end on this.
And I wanna get my goat in a second.
Don't bring him up yet.
Her up, I'm sorry.
But what happens if you've got a religion,
you need to maintain control of your people.
You need them to believe certain things.
You need them to act certain ways.
You need them to baptize their kids.
You need them to marry within the church.
You gotta control all of those aspects of their life
from birth to death.
It's what religio does.
It's what religio does.
Now imagine this.
Your religion has people who are initiated
who come in not knowing and they leave knowing.
They leave born again.
They leave born again.
These second deathers enter into the state
and receive some kind of knowledge.
And in the process, they are written
into the scroll of Zoe.
Isn't that nice?
Isn't that nice?
And why?
Because she's the one, she's the Aphrodite
who has that pathway.
I told you, you cannot give up the virgin.
You cannot turn away from the virgin.
It's her song.
If you forsake the virgin Mary,
everything is done.
You can wrap up your religion.
It's gone.
That's what they're doing the mystery for
in order to produce this vessel for the divine.
Are you out there?
Do you want to possess the divine?
Do you want to possess the divine?
There's a program for getting there
and imagine the control people.
If you're not just taking communion,
which is some kind of wine or grape juice
if you're Baptist, right?
Because God forbid you should touch
bachic blood, right?
When you take that communion,
you're not taking it as anything but a refreshing drink
and a little bit of a cracker.
You want a real communion?
You Christians out there,
you want a real Christian communion?
You want real flesh and blood?
You want that body and blood?
You're gonna have to go through the process
of entering death and being resurrected.
And I know you haven't.
You do not by any stretch of the imagination
if you are a Christian today possess ionic life.
You don't.
You have an insurance policy in your head.
That is it.
You haven't been there.
You haven't been initiated.
You don't know.
These are the people that you must steer clear from.
That's why they end up getting crucified.
All right, we came to the Eremon, the void tonight.
I want to thank you.
I want to thank you for your time.
And I want to say if we are careful and pay attention
to the symbols, not the images,
but the symbol that is the code, the secret code,
the two sides that come together,
the impulse and the response.
If we come back to that,
then we know we're in the right place.
Scientifically, we found it.
We've hit pay dirt, right?
Once you get down to that cult's basis,
once you can get into it and see the cult working,
once you see those early Christians,
why the Romans are saying,
stop frigging your children, right?
You know that you've entered that territory.
You can taste it and you can trace it
through all the drugs.
Thank you for coming tonight.
I want to be able to provide for you a perspective
as you're going through all seven spheres
so that you never lose sight
of what we're really shooting for.
What we're really shooting for
is that dirt in the text.
That dirt is there.
You will see Jesus for the first time in your life.
You will see him for the first time
when you get down to that dirt.
Thank you for coming tonight, Hail Satan.
You never came for payment fortune,
all the worldly renown.
On the day that it came and again,
you just turned it down.
All the way.
Why did you ever change your name?
All the way.
Why did you ever change your name?
Come on.
All the way.
