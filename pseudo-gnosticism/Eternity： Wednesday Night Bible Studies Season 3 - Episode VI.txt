I never meant anything I said, just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin' to keep it from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant, I never said the letters that I should've said
But so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows
When I say, never was the cause for a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
It's good to see you again. Tonight we're going to have a very productive evening
I'm going to send you to Eternity
We're also going to talk some details
of some things that are coming from our investigation
We're in for some good news
Yes, we're in for some good news
Well, I won't get to it
Until we roll the clip
So what's this good news, you say?
Yes, it turns down, the pole lords have handed down a what you would call a grand jury indictment
Yes, of the Son of God, yes they have
They've handed it down
So now, remember we are outside of time, right?
We're talking about bringing the future and the past together and compressing them
Do you know what kind of physics it takes to compress the future and the past into the present?
That is a chronic trick
Yeah, it takes a lot of skill
Tonight we're going to look at this process
We're going to go to Eternity
But we have some prison transfer to deal with first
We have yet another member who will be joining our population, our prison
And it is our duty as guardians of this place of incarceration
It's our duty to put the hurt on these
So, yeah, the watchers are watching and understand what's going on
We've got yet another incarceration
Who's next on the list, Chewie?
Bring us the clip, we've made a clip for you tonight
Music
Music
Music
Music
When young people have immense concern to all who have public responsibilities
My past visits to the church in every part of the world
have been deeply moved by the almost universal conditions of difficulty in which young people grow up and live
Music
Now, the current Pope has come out to denounce any sort of implication
That the great previous Pope who is a saint
We don't want to look at what he's done
But if that exorcist, that chief exorcist, it always comes down
The history always comes down to the necromancers
It's really funny that chief exorcist was right
And this was a way, Emanuella was just a way for the great father to procure another girl
Yeah, that's quite a right
They have tape recordings, they have tape recordings, right?
Running a big deal, right? Netflix, running a series on it, it's such a big deal
Yeah, so here we go, we get another one
But I rest assured all of my evangelical and Catholic visitors
Rest assured that your willingness to embrace these people is not odd
Despite their hideous actions
For your Lord himself screamed in the air when he was arrested in a public park
That he wasn't a child trafficker
He screamed it, not a child trafficker, what are you coming out with big guns?
Yeah, so it only makes sense that you would embrace this tradition
Welcome to prison
Your punishment is to face your reality
Yeah, so suck my tongue
Yeah, love it, love it, okay, lock that guy up, I don't care what his shirt says
I don't care if he's got an ST in front of it, lock him up, this is the devil's throne
Love it, it's good to see everybody not here again, but I know that you're there
And tonight I want to take us to some, oh, we're going to set the ship for the 15th
And we're going to fall into a time and a place where I'm going to take us to a pagan kingdom
A pagan kingdom, it's guarded, it's guarded by a guy who's part of the Order of the Dragon
Yeah, yes, you know what I'm talking about
He had a poet friend who fought with him
And from that poet's pin comes all from beginning to end
We're talking about Maroulas, Mike, I call him Mike
Mike is writing this amazing, amazing Orphic poetry, neoclassical Latin cult poetry
He's got the Medusa staring you in the face using the very same terminology that we've been following this whole time
So where do I want to take you? Through the 15th century, I'm going to catch, this is just the way time and space works
I'm going to catch a river, it's like a stream that pushes you, accelerates you
And I'm going to get us back to the Bronze Age, but I'm going to do it through this window that we've got
And that window is provided to you by the pagan that stands between the monotheists
Fish, watch the gestures, watch the gestures fish, it's the way the language is spoken
He knows what I'm talking about
Let's go now to Mike Maroulas and let's pull up who we're going to be invoking
We're going to be singing an invocation, warning to those of you who don't like such things
You should bail now, because this is the heart of Demogorgon
This is the heart of Demogorgon, this is that deep thing of Satan that we're bringing up tonight
Are you ready? Put yourself in the place of the pagan who fights the monotheists
He's got Christian army on one side, Muslim army on the other
And they all want the same thing
So, let's look at what his poet says
I'm going to read you a passage, we don't have the Latin for this
I'm going to put on my glasses
This is the, yeah, no, that's coming up, we're coming up
I'm building up to bring you to that inner chamber, I want to show you Eitanitas
To show you who she is, but in order to get to that Bronze Age religion
We have to go through the Celestials
You say what? Yeah, yeah, the Celestials
We are back looking at the sun, we are back looking at the sun
Do you know when the Saturnian age emerges?
It emerges when the sun is put into eclipse
It's the one time that Saturnian forces can be free
Yes, love it, love it
I'm going to bring you the words of the Celestials
Yeah
Listen, oh holy court of the blessed in heaven
Who possesses the sacred precincts of Olympus
And steadfast for all eternity revolve around the bright dwelling of Jupiter
On a nine-circled wheel, wait a minute
Oh, I'm sorry, this is going to get complicated
I lose it, right around the physics, that's when I lose it
So just hang in there with the analogies, right?
The math will get you every time
You've got to have a knowledge of...
What's up?
Yeah
Inspiring awe by your radiant visages
Your radiant cheeks, your radiant locks
And clothing is a cloud that reflects
The rays of the round fiery globe of the sun
Lamp of the day and when leaving her cold bed
Aurora glows at the approach of the new day
Do you see where we came setting wise?
I took you right to dawn
We went right to dawn, why did we do that?
Because we're in a cult following Dracula
And Dracula goes right to dawn
Let those who have ears hear
Aurora glows at the approach of the new day
Each time she awakens the weary hearts of mortals
To return to their labors
Which a short time ago found relief in sweet repose
Free of care
Listen to us
Blessed image of good palace
Wait, who?
Palace
Palace Athena
Yes, on top of the hill
Remember her who nourishes the snake
Blessed temple of palace
A guide to those who have followed
In your footsteps as far as possible
And free us from our chains
And from the heavy burden that oppresses us
We are transcending the confines of our base servitude
You traverse the heights of heaven
With a masculine firmness
Yes, that's her, right?
That's the virgin on the hill
Oh, you mean these guys who were in the service of Dracula?
Right, that's what they called him, right?
Because his father was the Dracula
He was the Draco, Dracon
In the Latin, right?
Right through the creek
Oh, God, it's delicious
It's ethereal
Your courage never failing
And now taking pity on labors and kingdoms here below
Doomed soon to fall
Like Atlas
You sustain the ponderous weight
Of the tottering ruins
At other times you rouse the indolent
With countless secret rites
Since you are free of all envy
Do you hear the call?
Do you hear the call
Of the virgin on the acropolis?
She who nourishes the snake
Yes, yes
At other times you rouse the indolent
With countless secret rites
Since you are free of all envy
And you remove mines and clothes
In their dark prisons
From the stigma of impiety
In your great kindness you rescue the ship
Already at the mercy of raging tempests
Come, come here
Blessed and most holy purification
Of heavenly beings and of men
So what are we doing?
We're setting, we're using that hymn
To set up where we are in the investigation, right?
The pollards came down and it turns out
There's enough to indict
There's enough to explain why he's there
And for those of you who are following
The mystery of the mystery
That includes dragon tongue
For those of you who are following it
We come to a very special place
I'm about to take you into the cave, right?
We stand at the entrance of the cave of eternity
Those rites that everybody are calling mystery
Those rites come from this cave
And that cave is guarded by a dragon
The hymn to eternity
I'll pull up the latin, just let you
Let's just let some of this slide off
Ipsa mihi wokim atque adamantina
Sufi keplektra
Dunga neres priorque ausis ingintibus asis
Immensi regina aiui
Kwae luki datimpla aitheres augostosque
Tenens augusta rekesus
Yeah, yeah
Give me
Create in me
Your voice
And provide to me eternity
Your unbreakable plectrum
Your plectrum is the thing that you play your instrument with, right?
Wait, what?
We're invoking a goddess
Okay, I see what we're doing
We're bringing the image
And we're doing it through the plectrum
That's nice
Do all of this while you are celebrated in song
Why else would you invoke the muse, right?
Yes
And be present for my daring actions
Oh, Queen of the vast IWUM
Queen of the ION
You and I have been looking at the ION
Do you remember that there was a fellow who told you
He'd give you a life of the ION?
He could give you IONIC life, you
You, you, you through your Latin trickery
Thought he said, I Tarnitas
He didn't
He didn't
He said IONIC
This is the life of the ION
This is what we have to offer
Look into the cave
See her sitting there
You who hold the shining temples of the ether
You who hold the shining temples of the ether
Again, if you're not following the physics
Don't worry, stick with the analog
You who hold the lucid temples of the ether
And those deep corners that have been brought to perfection
Oh, most perfect Augusta
What is Augusta? He calls her Augusta
You say, wait a minute, strike two
Strike two, I smell Romans
I smell Romans around here
Romans and Etruscans
You can always smell that Etruscan
From 30 feet away
Those Etruscans
They wear that stuff
And it gives off a very distinct odor
Yes, it does
You can always tell when they're around
Here they are
Somebody wanted odors
Is that a good odor for you?
Fantastic
You smell them, the Romans
As soon as you start
As soon as you start worshipping Augusta
You are square
You are square on that boot
Square
Love it
Love it, love it, love it
She is Augusta
Yeah
With your peace
You're establishing all things
You who are Beata
Most fortunate
Most fortunate
Yes
Whom youth follows
Youth, juenta
Wait a minute, strike three
There we are
We have a triad
We have a trinity
We have a group of three divinities
Wow, look at that
In an invocation
In a pagan invocation
From the 15th
That's marvelous
Those guys always miss it
I'll give them credit
We gotta give credit where credit is due
And those German philologists in the 30s
We're putting together all the texts
Leipzig
That group, you guys were great
You were crack
You were crack
But because you didn't have that Victorian edge
You just, you didn't have
They couldn't hold a candle
Those Victorians
To you guys
In the realm of grammar and syntax
But when it came to defining a word
It just wasn't there
On the German side
Naughto Kern is screaming
Hey, there's a secret language
Yes, right?
That's what we bring as eternity
Who is she?
She's that Regina
The Regina of that great ion
You say, wait a minute
That's above everything
Yes, outside of everything
Is that great queen
How do you cure a Nazi?
You cure him with the great mother
It's not amazing
We sit
We talk about things like artificial intelligence
Artificial intelligence
Not realizing that everything is bound by eternity
And she
She is that great mother
That great mother
Fantastic, it's gorgeous
Youth, youth is her constant companion
Along with virtue
And both of these daughters
Yes, both of these assistants
Come, help, help me to make the drugs
Help me, right?
Where are my Scythian maids?
Where are my Scythian maids?
Did I bring up Eros?
Did I bring up Eros?
Right, he's the one
Who you're going to see from within the cave
He is that lightning
That fills that cave
That she is waving
This is the Gnostic Enformer
Who will be able to identify her now
It's Nix, right?
Exactly, Eternitas
You're finding the first oracular way
The very first mystery comes through her
Yes
I can give you some stolen lines
I have six minutes
I can give you some stolen lines
And I can show you
Her
All-encompassing
Mystery operation
Just really quick
In our last few minutes here
By the way, for Project Medusa
I need to see
At the order tonight
I need to see
Our chief bio-engineer
I need him to report on Project Medusa
Please, if you can do that
I know it's last minute
But we need to bring this secret stuff in
Good, fantastic
Yes
I want to take you to the second
Should we call up that second
Bit of Latin?
Yes
And I just want you to see some of the
Some of the way that we picture her
That the dragon is able to bring eternity
Right?
For example, through the hand of Uintah
What is the hand of youth?
I mentioned this goddess
You thought, you know, unless you were an evangelical
Atheist, right?
Remember, the monotheists are all atheists
Right? That's what they are
They don't believe in a goddess
Called justice
It's just the way it is
But
Uintah, who is this Roman divinity
What are her hands?
What are her hands covered with?
Let's go to verse 9
Mike, can you bring up?
Thanks
Look at verse 9
What does she do? She assists
In the banquets
Right?
In the banquets, she assists in those
Holy divine banquets
Preparing that table
And what does she do?
She pours out in fundera
Her eunile nectar
Her youthly nectar
Purporea Manu
From a purple hand
From a hand stained with the
Purpurium
What was that?
Yeah, no, they've got that
Hand full of what we are
Bringing in the right
When Mary is offered
When she's 12
And she's offered after having been fed
In the holiest of holies
Her stain is purple
Yeah
Yeah, iternitas
Iternitas
Virtue
Establishes the borders
Oh, here, this is the last
Can we throw this in? Yes, we have time
It all has to do with
Stereoscopy
And you know
Some quantum physics
That I'm not sure that I want to
Even start to try to understand
But
I wanted to take you
To her bending on line 26
See where it says
Amfractus Aiwi
Warios Venturaque
Lapsis
Intermixa Legans
Presenti Inclusa Fidelli
Oh my god, what is she doing?
Okay, here's your look in the cave
Are you ready? Here's your look in the cave
She is bending back
The variations
Of the ion
She's what?
She is bending back
The various possibilities
Of the ions
Mixing
Things future
With things past
Creating
A present
That is
Faithful
Oh god
Yeah
Think about that
Think about that for a minute
What are the physics going on there
In that cave?
What exactly is she doing?
What exactly is she doing?
And how do we
How do we activate that mystery?
That's what they're all
Interested in finding
That's what they all want
They want that medusa
To the guys who couldn't get there
Because they went wrong
They didn't pay attention to
Bulwer Lawton
To the guys who couldn't get there
Because they took a wrong direction
The Aryan Queen
Just so you know
Because you don't
The Aryan Queen
Is a woman
We changed our names
To match hers
We shave our heads
To match hers
Welcome to Eternitas
If you understand what I meant
Something
Maybe I will do
Just put on different masks
And ask the questions that
That fella might have
