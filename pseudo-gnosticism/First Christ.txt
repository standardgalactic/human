Another drip from the glow and chalice
Glow and chalice, a trading venom
High purple, volume 211
When Tia hits you with a ticket to heaven
Open trends, bring her back from the dead
IMB, darkness through dreams
Everything in what it seems
Drake the snake, I got some magic beans
Riding horse back, I'm with my Diaz team
Everything I see is cream, straight from the bang
Up the dragon, the track's bump, it is the thing
Athena knows my slang, in the dark harbor
The drugs weigh a ton, Kachanga Lane
Creed Moore hit the mark, bang, bang
We're here to save the children, the museum we're building
Empty Christ prescription, trading venom
Illins, glow and chalice, a trading venom
High purple, volume 211
When Tia hits you with a ticket to heaven
Open trends, bring her back from the dead
We're here to save the children, the museum we're building
We're here to save the children, the museum we're building

I know you guys like this stuff
Oh written out right in front of you without somebody feeding you ideas and theories
But just straight up reason establishment cause straight up sources
That's all we need cause nobody's here for my ideas
Ride, I don't have anybody ask me
Do you have some ideas? No. I don't have ideas
I've got texts though, if you wanna talk texts
I want to start with a comment! Bring up this first comment
Go ahead Chewy! Bring us up this first comment
Brain sees salvation from salway.
Now, Amen Christ makes more sense to me.
Thank you, Eric.
Thank you, Eric.
You're right.
You're right.
And if anybody, if anybody's listening, buried here,
buried here is just a faint wind,
a faint wind of the sacred name.
Fantastic, that's that hidden name.
Shh, don't tell anyone.
Hit the next one.
Oh, goodness, a five minute video would suffice.
Would it?
Would it?
I wish Amen would talk about Christus
as used in spiritual context and hear his explanation
why he doesn't agree with that.
You want to hear what?
You want me to explain something?
I don't agree or disagree with anything, person.
I don't.
I'm a goober.
I don't agree with anything or disagree,
but since you want to see what a real Christing is,
I need you to know, I'm a goober,
that there is no separation and antiquity
between the religion and the salvation and the health.
The drugs are all a part of it.
And I know it's rough for you to consider.
I mean, it's probably rough for you to consider
that God is a woman, right?
People are shocked, by the way, if I can just say this,
the word for God, theos, is not a masculine form.
The oldest references we have to it,
it can be both masculine and feminine.
The concept of feminine divinity,
which is entirely lacking in the modest traditions,
was a basic part of language of ancient Greek.
So you got to get that into your head right now.
You got to be fully happy to appreciate
the fact that God is a she, fantastic.
Boy, that'll give him a hard time, won't it?
Let's hit the next one.
Oh my God, where's the best place to learn ancient Greek?
This brings us to the next point.
Thanks for your clarity.
Thank you, yes, on the real.
It's fantastic to experience, yeah, fantastic.
I'm glad you, it's because people have been asking
and I have been trying to devise mechanisms.
First, I donked to the wealthy and I said,
wealthy, give me some.
And they said, we got nothing for you
because you can't accommodate.
Oh God, where can I build my spring?
Where can I guard the temple of the muse?
I turned away from the rich.
And then I thought I could do it myself.
And I got an email from several of you
saying the same thing.
I can't afford to pay for any kind of classes or anything,
but I'm really interested in this material.
It's to those people, the devil eventually convinced me.
It's to those people that we owe this right, this privilege.
So what I am announcing tonight
is it's starting Wednesday night.
I'm in university, we'll open on Lady Babylon.
Now, over 20 weeks, I will take you through
an intensive course in ancient Greek, 20 weeks.
And what we will do is we will get people enlisted
and through basic training.
Many of you will want to take it.
Many of you will want to take it.
Many of you will be able to complete it.
All of you, all of you should.
As long as you have the desire.
It's up to me to push you through the program
so that you can get to the other side.
Doesn't matter what your IQ is,
doesn't matter how smart or how stupid you are.
We all start out the same place, ignorant of ancient Greek.
Yeah.
If you want to be part of a very distinguished group,
a group that includes people like Thomas Jefferson.
A group that includes some of the greatest minds, Sappho.
You want to sit with Sappho.
You want to be in her club.
This is the avenue for you to access that.
This is Wednesday night.
This will be on YouTube.
On YouTube, good question, thank you.
It'll be on YouTube, why?
Because the devil said, you know how it is, Omen.
You know, it's like, you know how it is, Omen.
When you get in this game, the contract says,
you want the knowledge?
Can't take any money for it.
You can't get rich off it.
You can't sell it.
Yeah, fantastic.
I'll make my own way.
I'll pay for my pizza.
I'll do it, people.
I don't want you to pay for my pizza.
So this channel, Lady Babylon, will never be monetized.
It will never be monetized.
I can guarantee you will never watch commercials.
And what we have to do is break the algorithm.
We break the algorithm because not taking money
is not acceptable in the world of the profit makers.
That is what we're here to break.
We're here to break that system.
Does Omen have a Patreon?
No, no, aren't she?
I do not do that.
I cannot do that, aren't she?
I can't.
The contract will be broken.
Satanic contract right out the window.
There's one thing Satan hates.
He hates greed.
He hates greed.
Oh, God, in humans.
Oh, God, humans are so for it.
It's like we breathe it.
Oh, my God.
So no, I would love to see us break the system.
Oh, what?
That's amazing, on YouTube.
Yes, the nut, I think that's me,
will not be sacrificed for the flower.
No monetization, no corruption.
Thank you very much.
You got it, HT.
You got it, you got it.
Give me the next comment that I pulled up
because that's guiding us as we're going through our talk.
Now, Wednesday night will not be presented
in the same way that Lady Babylon, Friday,
or the Bed of the Muse on Sunday will be presented.
This Sunday presentation is just you and me and the Muse.
This is our time.
This is our time to relish.
There's gonna be no arguments.
There's gonna be no, none of us,
none of, no controversy.
We don't need that.
What do you need to do if you're going to enlist?
Go ahead, put it up, Chewie.
Here is the bad boy.
I have taught with many, many Greek texts.
This intensive course is the best.
And why is that?
Because I took it in a second.
I think it was second or third year that they started it.
You know what I mean?
And I went to Berkeley and took this intensive course.
This was Hanson and Quinn who made this.
This is the second revision.
So make sure you get that second revision.
And I've used this with students and I can tell you,
I have the greatest success from this text.
And if I push you, take it down, like a drill sergeant,
people rise to the occasion because people want this.
People want to excel.
And what this is is elite training for your brain, right?
I'm not going to stuff your head full of facts.
I can't.
I'm going to give you the machinery of the ancient Greek
and that will reshape and remold your brain.
They can take your CAT scan beforehand,
or your PET scan, give that guy a PET scan.
Wait a while until he's done.
Give him another one.
Oh my God, look, he's lighting up.
He's lighting up.
That's the power of the language.
And you will be humbled by that constantly.
For those of you who have the desire to jump into that stream,
for those of you who have the calling,
I'll be waiting on Wednesday nights for one hour.
And I'll push you through the program.
I'll push you through the program.
Yeah, listen to my voice and do everything I say.
You'll be reading Greek.
Now, let's get this thing started.
Chewie, give me the next,
I'm going to give myself one more comment.
Trying to watch the video at the gym,
but creepy Jesus and boy pictures
are making me look like an absolute weirdo.
Isn't that great?
This is fantastic.
Thank you, Chief Gull.
Thank you, Chief Gull, for taking us on a workout.
That's fantastic.
Are you doing it now?
Everybody, right?
Come on, come on, do it.
He's looking at pictures of Jesus.
Yeah, ew, Jesus.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Give me the next one.
Why hail Satan while claiming not to be religious
or a Satanist, right?
Which, you know, I'm not.
It is to make a point.
Wait, wait, is it to make a point?
What is the point?
Or is it simply to excite Christians?
It does all of that stuff.
It's wonderful watching you go through the process, Jim.
It's watching you go through the process.
Look at what happens here.
He says, I am fascinated.
Oh my God, Jim.
Jim, did you know?
Did you know what fascination is?
Everybody, what is a foske, you know?
It is an ancient, prior to us,
an ancient erection, a phallus, a dildo.
There's lots of different ways to say it,
but that's what it is.
Fascination is when somebody points that at you.
They pointed at you, Jim, right?
I'm fascinated.
I'm rooted.
I'm not going anywhere.
The predator's out there and he's looking at me.
Oh, God.
Love it.
Let's see if it works today.
How are people uncomfortable?
People, get uncomfortable out there.
Hail Satan, right?
Everybody, hail Satan.
Why do I say hail Satan?
Look at...
No, no, this isn't...
No, that's okay.
It was the last one, give me...
Yep, that's okay.
I'm still a boy coming out of a cave.
Oh no, how do we get...
Come on, man.
The truth still makes me close my eyes and shock
like the night rays, right?
Okay, after being in the dark solo.
Look, this is a process.
People have always communicated this
and I try to explain it to them as you're peeling back
that unreality that floats around you
and has been crammed down your throat all your life.
The thing that you've been breathing, right?
It's become a part of you as you're unrooting that.
You're gonna pull up things like confusion.
You're gonna pull up things like uncertainty, right?
That's all okay.
That's the part of, you know,
and when you're in a laboratory
and you're doing experiments,
you got the same anxieties.
You have the same transformations.
As you walk on that path of reason, baby, right?
You can't go wrong.
Just hang in there on the path.
I had you playing, yeah, fantastic.
Let's go to the next one.
There was one we missed.
There was a good comment we missed
and I wanna get on to the meat.
Maybe it's this one.
Get that one, Chewy.
Okay, why he'll say it as I wanna finish this?
Claiming not to be religious.
Is it to make a point, et cetera?
I'm fascinated and confused.
Seems very honest.
I love the choice not to be tainted by the filth.
I like this.
That is merging truth with monetization.
People, listen here to Jim for one minute.
Thank you, Jim.
Just want the chance here to recognize
we're not tainting this with the filth of monetization.
What a novel.
What a novel thing.
Now, tonight I wanna bring you something.
It'd be a little bit shocking
and it's gonna take us out of our typical shoes
and put us into somebody else's sandals.
It's an orgy.
I'm bringing you back to the bucket orgy again.
We're gonna see a description of one
and you're gonna find somebody there
that's going to surprise you.
What is he doing in a bucket orgy?
Fantastic.
Give me the first, roll up the first
start chart there when you can Chewy.
Okay, here we go.
Look, people, what is this?
Now, everybody in the room,
this is one thing I love here
because everybody in the room who is not a classicist,
look at this and said, wait a minute.
I thought I learned Greek, right?
Is that Greek?
But it doesn't, look, it's odd.
It's weird.
There's words there that I've never seen before.
Oh my God.
Yes, this is notice.
This is notice and notice writes a giant epic.
It's the longest Greek epic about Dionysus.
So you can imagine there are descriptions
in dactylic hexameter.
What notice has done that you can't appreciate
from this text and I really can't appreciate it
like I should either.
But this is written in dactylic hexameter.
This thing is meant to be performed as a religious right.
It's got the cadence that we use if we're symbols.
It's got the Orphic meter.
Fantastic.
And I want to say, just right from the top,
what does it say?
Are you ready?
Picture this, we're going,
bucket orgy and you help me find the person who's there
that you wouldn't think would be at one.
All of the people gathered together
in order to generate that bucket song performed
during the evening revels.
Fantastic.
So we're gonna give this bucket revel.
What do we do?
We establish the rights.
It is through the bucket revel
that the mystery is executed.
Anytime Jesus talks about mystery,
Paul talks about mystery.
We're talking about a very specific operation
like the one Jesus is performing
in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Here we go.
Who's at this bucket orgy?
Oh my God.
We've got the drums.
We've got the drums playing, you know what I mean?
And people are dancing and what else is happening?
The torches are torching, baby.
They're just all brilliantly lit up.
These are torch lit.
Right, so you gotta get a little bit of the ambience
if you want the real mystery, you know what I mean?
This is way, way older than any of the mysteries
that you've been taught about.
Lovely.
And what happens here?
What happens here?
Oh my God.
Look at the last four lines, people.
Look at the last four lines.
The women, the women step up.
And what do they produce?
They produce a song.
They produce a song that is the Thelus Ioe,
third line from the bottom.
The women's shout.
Oh God, where do they put it?
They put it into the air.
Oh God, they seed the air with their cries.
And what are they doing?
They're creating.
They're creating a communion.
A communion that is the life energizer.
The life magnifier.
The life mania.
Okay.
Bacchic women.
I want you just to look at the one, two, three, four, five,
six lying down.
Look at the second word in the six lying down.
Chrionto.
Chrionto.
Wait, what does this say?
It says that the followers of Bacchus
are Christed.
It says the followers of Bacchus are Christed.
What are they Christed with?
They're Christed with a chalk.
Sometimes it's an earth.
You have to know how they're doing medicines.
Sometimes it's an earth.
It's a sediment that is made into a clay
that dries upon the face.
And they put it on their cheeks
so that the burning purple will be captured.
That come the burning purple that they've put in their eyes.
This is for the oyster mania.
This is the Christing that brings the salvation
or the health, right?
Without this Christing,
you are not part of those born of the ion.
Do you understand me?
Right?
No, you don't.
Because you haven't been through initiation.
We didn't kick you over to the other side.
You didn't see what was there.
You didn't come back.
And now you're full of the knowledge
of what the actual universe is.
Yeah, eyes open, ended up naked.
Why do we always come back naked?
If there was another way to get the drug
that wasn't so efficient, trust me, we would do that.
But for now, shh, shh, just shh, okay.
It's why they give them sedatives.
Oh, God.
Okay, bring it up one more under the Christ.
I just want to see under the Christ right there.
I want you to notice that the Christ here
on that one, two, three, four, five, six line down.
I want you to see, what is that Christ doing?
That Christ is mustipolo, chrionto, pareia leucadic yupsui.
What?
What?
What kind of drug is this that they're using?
It's a mystic drug.
It is, what does that mean?
That's a drug that is used within a mystery right.
You mean they have their own classification for drugs
that are used in mysteries?
Yes, they do.
Yes, they do.
You mean I thought just this week,
I woke up like Dan and I thought Jesus Christ
was some kind of special thing,
that term Christ was some kind of special thing.
It was Jesus made up or was given to Jesus
to the sacred and inerrant word of God gave to Jesus.
And you mean that is an older title,
a concept that's not at all unusual,
that we all know what it means and it's pharmaceutical?
Yes, salvation is pharmaceutical.
How do you think you get ionic life?
You will lift up serpents, you'll lift them up,
you'll drink.
I'm Jesus, I'm doing my Jesus impression.
You'll drink the death inducers,
but they will not harm you.
Oh, Jesus wants me to drink death inducing drugs.
Jesus, I love you so much.
Oh God, it's all that arrow stuff.
I thought it was the arrow stuff, let's take them there.
We got the arrow, come on, give me the next one.
We're going fast tonight people because
this is the sacred bed, man.
This is Hera, we protect this environment.
I just want you to notice the people that are doing this
on line 732, the Omegeras Politae.
Who are the people who are involved
in the Bacchic ritual that you're watching?
These are citizens, these are citizens who work together.
That's what the Bacchic initiation is.
Servants who work together, and what do we do?
We get into these groups.
Are you ready to get a chorus going?
Are you ready to get a chorus going to purge the state?
Get your mask on.
Get your mask on, did you wonder why they wore masks
in tragedies?
Because they are Bacchic celebrations,
they are Bacchic rituals.
The priest of Bacchus sits right up front.
Make sure that nothing is done incorrectly.
They say that stuff that you put on your face now
is going to be able to combine with the purple.
And strangely enough, it may make the goop
that's on Jesus's face when he's got that bandage
wrapped around that little boy's private parts
and through which he is drawing the child's galene,
the antidote to that combination of the purple
with the venoms that he has impregnated
in that linen wrap.
It's a chemical right.
Salvation is a chemical process.
What you see today is nothing
what original Christianity was.
Nothing, it's not even close.
It's a laughing stock.
Yes, oh my goodness.
Didn't you think she would come back?
Didn't you think Lady Babylon would come back?
Ryan, what do you think she,
what do you think the whole deal is?
Let's see the next one and we're done.
Let's see the next one.
Nope, yeah, the next Greek text.
Maybe that one.
Yeah, go ahead.
Chewy randomized this thing.
Here we go.
Who do we need people for this cult?
Now let's just call the name of the God.
Let's just call them.
What are they doing?
Remember, we're watching them.
We didn't even have the ship take off today.
We just went right there.
Here they are.
We're watching a Bacchic ritual, right?
Who are we calling on?
We're calling on iobajos.
That very first line, iobajos.
And what is iobajos doing here?
He is gathering his women
and his horned satyrs together.
And he is entering the Bacchic mania
for the sake of conflict.
When he sees his enemy,
the defender of that city of Argos.
And what does he do?
He holds up his thersis.
He holds up his wand.
This is the one with the serpents on it.
This is the one with the serpents on it.
Does somebody see Moses?
Does somebody see what the author
of the third century Septuagint,
who's writing the Bible in Greek?
Do you see what he did?
He took Bacchus and made him Moses,
the follower of the muses,
aka Musaeus.
Now, I didn't make that up, right?
I didn't figure that out.
Over time, I might have figured that out.
But I didn't.
They did in antiquity.
You mean people challenged Moses in antiquity?
Yes, why?
Because before the third century, he didn't exist.
There's no quotes.
Can you believe Moses would write his books
way back in like 1200,
maybe as early as 13, 1400 BC.
But he would write them way back then
and nobody between then and all the way down
in the third century would ever quote them.
Nobody'd make a vase and put a word on it
and he, those don't exist?
Nope.
Somebody said the other night,
a theologian stood on this stage
and said to you via a clip that I played.
Yeah, he said Hebrew literature.
Let me alert you to something right now.
There is no Hebrew literature.
It doesn't exist.
You have the Septuagint.
That's it.
Nothing is quoted.
You don't have anybody in Pendar's Day quoting.
Oh, let's quote Moses.
Quote Moses, right?
What you do have, that's because the language was dead,
right?
Hebrew was long dead by then.
What you do have in Greek writings
like diascordes in the first century,
he'll talk about the name for specific drugs
and he'll say, oh, the Babylonians call it this.
The Romans call it this.
The Greeks call it this.
Talk about North Africans.
What do they call it?
And oh, the Hebrews call it this.
So we know, we know that there's the concept
of the language in the society,
but we know it's not being used.
It's not even showing up in the synagogues.
It's irrelevant.
The Torah is a fictional work from the third century BC.
Let me say that one more time.
I'm gonna say that I want it to make the impact
that it should because if you understand this,
and it calls into question a lot, the big three,
the monists man have a problem with this.
They can't live with this, right?
No, they can't live with this
because it means Moses and Abraham and Noah are all made up.
Now, let me give you an example of the concrete reality
of what I'm trying to expose for you.
When I was at Tel Makedo, which is in Israel
and it's the reputed side of Armageddon.
Isn't that nice?
When I was there, there was a building
way over the temple, right?
Layer-wise, way over.
Probably Iron Age, probably Iron Age.
And they were already calling it the building of Solomon.
They had it named already.
Do you know how dishonest that is?
That is what Israel Finkelstein fought against.
He's telling everybody, hey, this stuff,
this kingdom of Israel stuff,
there's no fucking evidence for this.
Excuse me.
There's no archeology for this.
Well, it's the same thing on the writing side.
There is no Hebrew.
Well, weren't there only in the idea
there were older Hebrew texts?
Yeah, that's the idea, but that wasn't a reality.
There weren't any texts, huh?
You mean ancient Hebrew is no different
from Oscar and Umbrian from Italy,
that they had a very small vocabulary
and eventually got swallowed up
by a more proficient language like Latin or Greek, right?
Yes, yes, that's what happened.
When you go into those ancient synagogues
and you look, what's there?
Greek, surprise, the zodiac is there.
If you are practicing Orthodox Jew today
and you do not follow Ion and the zodiac,
you're not doing what they did, right?
You're not doing what they did.
So, Yaho is the God that was followed
by monists of the second and first centuries BC, right?
That's the history that comes
from the documents themselves.
Okay, okay, let's get back to that source.
I wanna get back to that source.
Just say a couple of things.
Just look at the Greek people.
Yeobakos is who the ride is celebrated to.
He gathers his women, right?
His women, what do his women do?
They are the voice, dude.
You don't have anything at a Bacchic revel
if you don't have the voice.
Everything is about the female voice.
It's on that line.
It talks about Yahweh that we looked at before.
That feminine voice.
Now, if you think about this for a minute,
I'm telling you, the mystery ride, pre-Christian,
the mystery ride is being brought into existence
through a very specific female voice.
Okay.
Ah.
Chewie, do you wanna show us something?
Okay, Chewie is dying to show us something.
Give it to us.
Give us to us.
Yes, how glorious.
So I will push now.
I've got a lot of comments from women who are saying,
hey, it's nice to see some strong women
who were not, you know, pictured to, you know,
who, you know, maybe you didn't think
this type of person existed.
You know, I was watching the Olympics today
and I was saying to myself,
people are almost getting it.
We're almost getting closer and closer
and closer to the spirit of the Olympics, right?
We're almost, they're starting it out in Greece.
They're taking it serious.
Now we get to the Olympics and look at what we've got.
Look at what we're running in this year.
People will say, oh my God, how revealing, right?
Did you know they ran the original Olympics naked?
That's part of the whole deal.
Have you seen those athletes?
My God, what beauty.
That's how I look at myself
and I think that's how I could have been.
What happened?
Right? Where were my, oh my God.
Take off their clothes.
Olympic committee, take off their clothes.
Let them run.
Don't worry, people get used to it
by the third race, people will be, right?
And then it'll be like, wow, look at that human form.
And then you can worship the human form.
Oh my God, you worship the human form?
Why would you do that?
Because it's thing of beauty.
It's a thing of beauty.
Do you see how monism saps the nature?
Just like Paul was saying, it saps the nature
out of the culture.
Monism needs you to be detached from your natural roots
so that when you look into the eyes of he or she,
he or she, whom you find beautiful,
that there's that incredible thing that happens.
Yeah, ooh, right?
That's what we need to stifle.
This is what Bacchus releases, is this power.
This is what the Christ does.
Okay, okay, let's go to the next,
go to that, the last text again.
Yep, I'm gonna finish it up.
What happens here?
So Dionysus is watching, he raises his thesis, right?
And what does he do?
He juts his head forward and his horns
become his adamantine defense, right?
His horns, he shows his horns.
His horns are that stone, which was petrified
by the rain, Zeus.
What is that?
What is that horn?
It is Alexeterra, second to last line.
Alexeterralithogleneoia, medusis.
Oh my God, medusis, what?
What is it?
It's the Alexeterra, that stone.
What is Dionysus' horn?
I'm giving you right now the very central light
of the mystery.
Are you ready?
When you look at Michelangelo,
when you look at Michelangelo and his Moses has horns,
this is why.
Are you ready?
Right out of the cult's mouth.
It's the Alexeterra of the medusa.
It's the Alexeterra.
What is his horn?
Give me the next one.
It's the Alexeterra, and what is that?
What is that?
That's Yobacos, yes, that's who we're talking about,
but it's his horn that we're talking about.
Wait, get to his horn.
Oh my goodness.
Oh, it's not.
Oh, it's coming up.
Wait, wait, it's coming up.
It's coming up, and you won't believe me here.
I'm gonna search it out.
I'm gonna search it out.
I don't care.
Give me the Alexeterra.
Here.
Oh, it's not the, no, no.
Thank you.
Oh, look, people, here it is in the Greek.
Wait, here it is in the Greek.
It's probably the next one.
Here it is in the Greek.
Now listen to me, people.
This is why Greek, ancient Greek, is so superior.
And ancient Greek and modern Greek are the same thing.
Ancient Greek has the capacity for the person
who is living to make new words for you
to describe your environment in a way
that has not been expressed.
This word in the middle, it's words like this,
that our author has made up, and people of a society
our author has made up, and people have assumed
because classicists are stupid.
They have assumed that this is because
these words don't exist in other texts.
No, no, no.
What the Greek is doing that is different from Latin
and every other language that got wiped out.
What it's doing that's different is it is giving
the user the capacity to create.
And you don't have that otherwise.
English uses Greek in order to achieve this, right?
Our Anglo-Saxon, oh God, where's that Anglo-Saxon?
Where's that Anglo-Saxon guy?
Come here.
His name's probably Fred or something, come here.
Friedrich, oh God, bro, your language.
Ow, it's awful.
Your language is awful, right?
So what is the elecce tera?
What is the elecce tera?
And I'm gonna say this before, before I show you
and you're gonna cry at me, and you're gonna say,
no, this is not drugs.
This guy is crazy.
I'm gonna tell you right now, the elecce tera
is the antidote.
It is what keeps the poison of Medusa non-lethal.
We hold up the serpent.
Now, those of you who are sitting there are gonna say,
no, look, he's making Christing stuff about drugs again.
It absolutely cannot be.
Are you ready?
Here we go, pull up these Victorians.
Oh God, what is the elecce tereos?
It's something that's able to keep off or defend or help,
especially as an epithet for the gods.
Isn't that nice?
It's your defense for your salvation.
You know the gospel.
Look at number two, Alexetarian.
What does it say right under it?
Pharmacon, drug, it's a remedy or a medicine or a charm.
See, to us, those three things sound totally different.
You know what I mean?
Like I can see how remedy goes with medicine, but charm?
Yes, they are not different.
Magic is medicine.
It is magic and antiquity for me to give you a drug
that will cause you satiriasis.
So that for six long days and nights,
we will chase you through the forest.
And we hope that you get away
and that your priapism relents.
This is a chemical salvation, people.
Your savior was a chemical savior.
And the only way he was gonna succeed
was if he got the antidote through that boy.
And he didn't.
Poor kid ran off.
Mark 1451 and 52, for those of you who are getting it.
Okay, let's, we're almost to the conclusion here.
Ba-ba-ba, let's go to the next one.
Boom, hit me with that one.
What am I giving you tonight?
What are we watching?
We are watching the Parthenon.
Who are the Parthenon?
Wait, it wasn't Mary, right?
Dan will say, or the theologian will say,
oh, wasn't it Mary, mother?
The Blessed Mother Mary, yes.
The Blessed Mother Mary, who in the Apocrypha
was fed angel food in the temple
and had her fingers stained purple
because she worked with a purple.
One day a midwife came in,
palpated her to see if she was pregnant
and burned her fingers because of the purple.
What is going on in the temple?
I am telling you, there are virgins, Parthenoi,
and what comes from their agri-anathon?
You know what an agri-anathon are?
They are your jaws that are wild with frenzy.
What comes from these virgins
who have the frenzy jaws?
I-nigma, oh, listen to the meter.
I-nigma, I-nigma, I-nigma, I-nigma.
That's a dactyl, long, short, short, right?
Oh, God, why?
Because the sphinx, you thought the sphinx was a cat,
was like a human head, seriously?
No, no, no, these are Syrian tribes
and these are women who are governors, Medusa, right?
And what traditions are they pushing?
They're pushing the venom traditions.
What do we cry when we cry iobacos, right?
Why do we cry?
We cry i-o, we cry i-o.
Could you tell me what the i-o is?
Give me the last, it was the whole bunch of things.
There's enigma, it's the whole bunch of last things
that we, hang on, we skip these.
Now we gotta go back, we gotta go back.
Look at this, oh, here's one, iadzo, right?
Same route, to cry aloud, to cry aloud.
Here's another one, i-a, oh my, what is the route
when you're crying i-o, right?
Heal, we are healing.
What are we using?
We're using that violet-covered stuff.
And what else?
The ios, the poison as of serpents.
Mad dog, venom, mad dog, venom.
You wanna go deadly nuts?
Take this virus, what?
Virus, virus is the Latin term.
And it's got a diagram in it
because the Mycenaean Greeks were so into drugs.
Okay, let's keep going up.
Ios, what is the Ios?
It's an arrow, people.
Remember we're talking about poison arrow using cultures,
marauders, sphinxes who come in and say,
give us 12 virgin boys.
What, what do you want?
You don't want taxes?
Nope, money's no good.
They want virgin boys, fantastic.
Okay, well here we go, round up your kids.
For those of you who don't like pirates,
like Julius Caesar, you can hunt them down.
You know, somebody asked me,
I thought this was a brilliant question.
They asked me, you can take it down.
They asked me, they said,
what happened between Caesar and the pirates?
I said, Caesar got abducted.
He was pissed that they were asking too little for ransom.
And then when he ransomed them,
when he got ransomed, he came back with a fleet
and he insisted that these guys be put to death, right?
So he crucified them all.
It looked like they were gonna get away with it.
You know, there's a lot of stuff going on.
The pirates were kind of a buffer zone against the Romans.
So people were using them and somebody asked me,
why crucified?
I said, because they weren't thieves.
You don't crucify thieves or bandits.
You find them.
Yeah, you find them.
They may spend some time in jail, but you find them.
That's not what you do.
That's not what you do with a laystace
when Jesus said he was a laystace, right?
I mean, he said he wasn't, sorry.
He said he wasn't a laystace, right?
They came out against him with the big weapons.
That's what we're looking at.
We're looking at that type of person.
That's the type of person we crucify.
Didn't you notice there was a mob there?
Did you ever wonder that?
There's a mob there.
Why is it so many people hate Jesus all of a sudden, right?
Because it was a problem.
It was a problem.
What those organized traffickers,
basically child prostitution is what they were pushing.
But you can't really call it child prostitution
because it was also, it was a range of ages.
But to us, it would be technically child prostitution
because they're picking the age groups, right?
That are just pre-puberty to post-puberty.
I'm thinking of it as, you know,
they're kind of farming humans, right?
So yeah, that's, people were not happy.
And you go after those guys with big weapons.
And that's why Jesus is saying what he's doing.
Okay, let's go to the last two.
I wanted you to see too,
that Io also is connected with the moon
and the person of Io who is an Argyve princess, right?
Oh, daughter of Enochus.
And that is why the Bacchians are called Enochian.
Yes, oh, the women, right?
Io, think of Io.
Great, fantastic.
Give me the last two.
Watch this, pull up the Bible here and what happens?
Simon Peter answered him and said,
Su ei ho Christos.
Su ei ho Christos.
You are the Christ.
Okay, are you ready?
So all of the mania that is the Bacchic mania,
all the prophetic power,
Peter is telling Jesus, this is yours, this is yours.
Yeah, son of God, same titles, right?
The Bacchians are using.
And the only way we get to the same cult
is through the same drugs.
The New Testament is not some cheap literature
that's fabricated to try to copy pagan models.
No, no, no, no.
It's a dude who was using the same machinery
to perform the same cult.
And that's exactly what Peter is getting him.
It's where he's getting him, he's nailing him.
And it's perfect, it's a perfect description.
Give me the last line and we'll end up,
now watch this people, these are the translations.
Just so you'll believe me, when I tell you
that theology is garbage, is complete garbage.
Look at the translators, Simon Peter answered.
You are the Messiah.
Wait a minute, what?
Wait a minute, what?
That's not what the text said.
Why would you assume?
Second translation, new living.
Simon Peter answered, you are the Messiah.
Really?
Really, what did King James say?
And Simon Peter answered and said,
thou are to the Christ.
Yes, thou are to the Christ.
Do you see how Christians didn't even know
how to handle their own titles?
Why?
Julian the Apostate warned us,
you cannot allow Christians to educate
using classical sources.
They will change them, they will destroy them,
and you will no longer have classical wisdom.
Do you see what matters to the monists?
What matters to Christianity is the box.
You are either a monist in the box
with the rest of us or you're dead.
We are different from everyone else around us.
We do not live the same history.
We follow a fairytale and we suck it up.
Yeah.
The drugs, people, the drugs show you the difference.
All you have to do is follow the drugs.
And these translators, they get my goat.
I just wanna finish with the translators,
getting my goat.
Great, Penelope.
For those of you who knew to Lady Babylon,
meet Penelope.
Penelope, Lady Babylon.
The cross, you want an explanation, of course.
Just like Hail Satan, you want an explanation.
The cross covers a multitude of sin.
Look at that cross.
Look at the sin that the cross is hiding.
God bless us for that cross.
