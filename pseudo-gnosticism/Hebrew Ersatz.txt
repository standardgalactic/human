Lady Babylon in the flesh
The little bits that you give to the goddess
Athena follows Odysseus around
She makes men fulfill their desires
To be worth the woman
Christen was Aphrodisiac
Once you are out producing the theory egg
Watch out your brain will open up
Athena with a purple cup
Cheats you all up, control the crush
You begin the pace, roll the move
As you get better soon, wish you were
Cheats you all up, control the crush
You begin the pace, roll the move
As you get better soon, wish you were
Welcome back to the Lady Babylon
This is Initiating Apocalypse
And I have lined up
A beautiful, beautiful date for us tonight
I want you to have this gift that I'm going to bring you
And I'm going to spring it on you
I'm going to surprise you with it when you see it
That's what I'm going to bring you tonight
Just a little bit of extra, a little bit of extra
Hail Satan everybody, that's right
That's right, blind Lewis
Hail Satan, love it
Thank you for coming back tonight
I want to bring you something that is Lady Babylon
But in order for us to get to her
We have to go through centuries of lies and liars
We've got to cut through what was placed
Over the narrative
We've got to cut through that and get back
Beyond to the original dirt
To the original dirt
And that's what we're going to do tonight
And we're going to at the same time
I want to apologize ahead of time
I'm going to be making
Merciless fun of languages that are inadequate
I'm going to bring you to take you to look at those languages
And their third grade level that got swallowed up
Got swallowed up by this masterpiece of beauty
Number one prize, Ancient Greek
Ancient Greek, you know those apes didn't get any
Didn't get any further than they did
But they did have Ancient Greek
Yeah, yes
1.7 million unique word forms
That's a lot, that's a lot of different thoughts to have
That's a lot of different places to go that we've never been
And it's a continuous swim in this gigantic bottomless lake
You can go as deep as you want
Tonight we're going to go deep
We're going to go deep and we're going to start out here with number one
Hit me with that number one
We're not going to start where you think we're going to start
We're going to start with Wikipedia
This is the first time we're going to be using the entry
Because I want you to see here
What is this entry? It's Nahum, the minor prophet
Right, everybody knows their Bibles
You didn't want Nahum, right?
What does this say about him? Nahum, Hebrew
Really, really?
It was a minor prophet whose prophecy is recorded in the Tanakh
Also called the Hebrew Bible
And the Old Testament, the Septuagint
What does it say? How is it different?
Okay, well tell us, who is this guy?
He wrote about the end of the Assyrian Empire
Oh, really? You really think so?
How are you getting all of this information?
Now pay attention, this person is trying to take you into the back alley
They're trying to pull a quick one on you
And these people who do this, who commit this crime, history, these liars
They do it with these figures like Isaiah
Do you really think Isaiah existed?
No, he didn't
No, he knew anything
None of the writings, none of these people's writings survived
And the funny thing is, that's the only quote-unquote Hebrew that we've got
That's the only
Do you know what this, I'm going to give you something, this is a surprise
But it's not a surprise, I'm bringing it for you particularly
You are dealing with a language that is fake
These texts, the guys copying the stuff
In the case from Qumran, they're copying that from the Greek originals
That language is defunct, it's dead, it's gone
And people are faking it
They're faking it
My God, imagine that
How could we tell? How could we tell that this is happening?
It's all in the language, it's all in the Greek
It's beautiful
So remember, this thing is being written in the third century
And it's being written at the level of, I'd put it like an eighth grade level
Yeah, I put it about there
Yeah, and by the way, this fakery that's happening can be very easily traced
Did you know that the same person who wrote Lamentations also wrote Esther?
Yeah, you can just show it from their language
Now, you couldn't show that before because you thought it was from Hebrew
Which is a later invention from a language that didn't leave any libraries, any literature
Did you know the only ancient Hebrew that you have are from the document that we know is from the third century?
Greece, right? Well, Greek, Egypt
But the area of the world that is actively using Greek
Where Greek is just coming and kicking the life out of the weak languages, weak languages, watch this
We're going to show you some weakness
Give me that next one, watch this people
Nahum's writings could be taken as prophecy or as history
Okay, these writings, those are genres, right?
So no, it's either prophecy or it's history
So two very different things
And these genres have been well established for many centuries by these crazy Greeks
And when I say Greek, all different ethnicities and different types of Greeks
But people who spoke the language that swallowed everything else up
Look at this, Nahum's writings could be taken as prophecy or as history
One account suggests, why does it suggest it?
Because you're making stuff up
One account suggests that his writings are a prophecy written about 615 BC
Just before the downfall of Assyria
Oh, I wonder why we think he's from there because that's what the document says
That we have from the third century
We already have the fricking Septuagint in the third century
Nobody has heard of it before
Nobody, there's no records of any of these fictional characters
None of them
Julius Caesar, what does he want me to say?
He wants me to say he is more real
Do you understand?
Oh my God, watch what happens
The book was introduced in Reformation Theologian Calvin
Who's a murderer commentary as a complete and finished poem
Calvin caused all sorts of death, nice job
How do I know that people? Because I'm a friend of the devil
And every once in a while he shows me the chambers where all of these bastards are being tortured
And it's gorgeous, it's absolutely gorgeous
It's for a prison tour sometime
You'd like it, they used to make a picnic out of that
Odysseus went out just for the sake of going to hell, right?
It's nothing new, nothing new man, going to go see grandpa
Doesn't anybody want to see grandpa? Give me that, blow it up Chewie
What does he say? Now listen to this, this is total silliness
I'm not going to dwell on this, no one of the minor prophets seems to equal the sublimity
The vehemence and the boldness of Nahum
Do you want to know what that vehemence is? He talks about his intro, right?
And he says, look he's got a beautiful, he's got this beautiful ramp
What? Have you read any ancient literature?
This is child's play, it's not just child's play, it's insulting
The ramp up is a God is frigging angry, God's going to destroy you
What have you done? Where are all those harlots?
God's going to kill you all
That's what this is about a city called Nineveh
And who was in Nineveh? Lady Babylon was in Nineveh
And I'm going to show you the text and the text is going to tell you
And I promise you this tonight, if you'll hang in with me
The text is going to speak my name
And the text is going to show you the future
Are you ready? You're going to love this, you're going to love this, it's delicious
Who were they? Were they invited? That's fantastic
Hello guys, have a seat. Did they drink it yet?
Alright, let's see, it's taking longer than usual, Chewie
What's going on? Make sure you've got enough in the mixture
There are indications that an acros- oh watch this, watch what happens
There are indications that an acrostic underlines the present text
Thus one-two begins with the first letter of the alphabet
The Hebrew alphabet, they're talking about the Hebrew traditions
That built later on top of the Greek
So the people who were translating the original Septuagint
Those people were creating a form of Hebrew
That ends up, they try to do cutesy stuff like
Weave in acrostics, alphabeta, gamma, delta
Right? Oh, I'm sorry
I'm in alphabet, gimble, dalit
Why do they have the same mommy?
Why do they have the same? Do you know why, Timmy?
The Greek is ages older
Ages, ages
And the Greek is flourishing all over the Mediterranean
All over and those people there, they're speaking Greek
And there's a movement of them, a group of monists
Because I want you to realize something as we work through this
I want you to realize there was no Hebrew circulating
There was a group of monists who were of the Jewish ethnicity
And these monists, just like the evangelicals today
I've got lots of friends in Israel who would tell you to your face
You can take that religion and shove it
Right? They don't care about that
They care about the democracy
And I'll bet they're upset
I'll bet they're thinking they could make their voices heard
I bet they are
These are the people
These are the people
It's the classical spring that we have to go back to
And in order to do that, I've got to take you to some dark places
Here's another one
What was there? Anything there?
Here, what is this?
This is the prophet speaking
After God said he's going to crush everyone
He's going to even destroy their city
Take it off its foundations
Right?
And he's going to say like the Smeelachs
Right? Like the Smeelachs
When it is put into the form of a crown
It gets all dry and brittle
A calamity of grass blows away
That's what he's going to do
That's what he's going to do to these people
Especially these people in Nineveh
Right? Give me the next one
That's where we are as Nineveh
Nineveh and people will say, wait a minute
Are we in Bible times? No, we're in history
I just want you to see that I'm not making this up
The enemy shall be laid bare
Even to the foundation and shall be devoured
As twisted you and as stubble, fully dry
Do you know what that you is, that Smeelachs?
That is the botanical that is used in those crowns
As we celebrate the dead
The dead
Okay, all right, give me the next one
I need the next one, I'm not sure
Okay, look at the new international version
Now this is going to be based on the Hebrew
They will be entangled among thorns and drunk
From what?
And drunk
There's no drunkenness in there
This is the Smeelachs
There's no drunkenness in there
This is my example
I think three examples of how bad Hebrew was used
To distort the original Greek meaning
And this is one of them
This is what I call invention
Something has to be thrown in
Because they didn't like what was being said
And boom, right?
It was either because they didn't like it
Which I think is why they're dropping a lot of the Christs
From the Hebrew
The Hebrew will drop it out, right?
By the way, a little tidbit of an announcement of beauty
There is no word Messiah
I'm not kidding you
I'm not kidding you
When you're talking about that in the Septuagint
It's the Christ
It's never
And that's why the governor asked him
You know what I mean?
Who's truth, baby?
Who's truth?
Give me the next one
Quick, while they're down
Watch this
I just wanted you to see
You can talk about food
To be eaten
Let's get back up again
Fatima Khan
Look at that, Fatima Khan
As opposed to Potom
I just wanted you to see
The things that we can eat
Are drugs
Drugs
Give me the next one
Here it comes
I'm not sure
I'm going fast
Here's another common error
Going from the Greek to the Hebrew
As you browse
Looking at what the Hebrew did to the Greek
You'll find it will drop concepts
Like logezmos, right?
It'll drop polyslabic, complex concepts
It'll drop them off completely
Go to the next one
And what else?
I wanted you to see here
Look at the reasoning here
Counting or calculation, okay?
An account or a reckoning
A holding of an audit, okay?
Without reference to number
It's reasoning, an argument
Or reasoning power
So that is your power of calculating
Your power of discernment
Via reason
Love it, love it
Logos, right?
Okay, so this concept
The author and the Septuagint
Is able to handle
The translator's not
Give me the next one
And what's going to happen?
I'm God
So I'm going to destroy, right?
This is the monism
This is the third century
Remember we're in the third century
And this is being written
This is the Septuagint, right?
It's being written in Greek
For the first time
And what does he say we're going to destroy?
Of all you people, right?
Who are all in this cult
We're going to destroy your glupta
Your sculptures and your honelta
Your things that are molten
Things that you have to create a cast for
You know what I mean?
Pour the molten metals in there
And you know, there you go
I'm going to break all that shit
Okay, now wait a minute
Wait a minute
Where are we in time?
We're in the third century
You're going to get a hiccup
Because we're going to go back a little bit
We're going to go back in time
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Watch this, people
I, you know, God is saying
Kurio says, look, I'm going to turn away
The hubris of Jacob
And the hubris of Israel, right?
Now, hubris is a very complex
Greek concept
And it's perfectly native right here
It's gorgeous, right?
Fits gorgeously
But there's no way this is a translation
Of the Hebrew
Because the Hebrew, give me the next one
What does he do with their hubris?
And the Hebrew, where is that?
Well, oh, here, that one
Give me the next one
Oh, he turns it into a virtue
Excellency
And of course, the King James translators
Are using the Hebrew
Faked form
It's a forgery
Historically, that's what you call it
The Hebrew forgery
Is producing this
The Lord has turned away
The Excellency of Jacob
Wait, what?
Wait, what?
Excuse me?
Now, if you think for a minute
That any person would translate
Excellency into the Greek word
For hubris, you have no reckoning
Of ancient Greek
Hubris is something that you do
There's a whole science of hubris, by the way
It's like psychology, right?
They have a track
Koros hubris ate
First you get wealth
Then hubris
Some kind of act where you think
You're better than the rest of us
Yeah, and where the God sends you then
What does the universe send you then?
Sends you your downfall
Hitler sends you your downfall
Down with tyrants
Down with tyrants
Do you know why Euripides has the tyrant?
Come out and forbid people from worshiping Bacchus
Yeah, yeah
It's time to go
It's time to go
Give me the next one
Oh, by the way, did I mention the interview?
No
Emily Moyer, please
Satanic congregation
While there's 606 of you
That's nice
It makes me comfortable
Go to Emily Moyer
And I'll put out a link to her podcast
And I just had a delightful conversation
And I think she's one of the most interesting people
That I've met
And I'm compelled by part of the reasoning stuff she was doing
It was mental gymnastics
And she is a gymnast
I think something wore off
Something about the gymnasium
Shall we go wrestle?
I love it
It was a good conversation
She's an incredible person
Let's go to the next one
Since, look, I'm telling you constantly
Please, Satanic congregation
I'm constantly telling you, look
The Greek stuff just is way beyond anything in the area
Right?
I want to actually show you
You're looking at the so-called
Epic of Gilgamesh
Written in that chicken scratch
Listen, I had near-eastern studies with Norman Yaffe
Who knows this chicken scratch inside and out
And Babylonian and Acadian and all the other Adians
Okay?
There was a library
Of this dude named Osher Bonnie Paul
And if you can call it a library
It produced some stuff like this
Like this, and really people
It's mostly list, palace lists and stuff like that
I'll show you because you don't believe me
But I want you to look at it
Satanic congregation, look at that chicken scratch
Oh, my God
The history of humanity is the history of languages
That suck and die
And languages that conquer
It's a survival thing
It's probably in its DNA
Look at that, come on
I was going to read that
Seriously, I would scratch my backside with that
That's what I would do with that if I were
And I know I'm talking like the ancient Greeks did though
But there's a reason, come on man, seriously
You really want to test me?
Okay, fine, fine, let's look at Gilgamesh
Get in here, get in here Gilgamesh
Now what you're doing, come here Gilgamesh
Is you're interviewing a third grader
Gilgamesh, take some of this
Here we go, bring it up
Bring it up, people, don't tell me
This is just because of the translation
Are you ready?
They placed food in front of him, comma
They placed beer in front of him
What was that, tell me
What happened at the party, tell me
Can you tell me one more time?
Anki do what? Anki do nothing about eating bread
For food, for food, really?
And if drinking beer, he had not been taught
I get it Tommy, okay just tell me what happened
The harlot, Tommy, don't use language like that
The harlot spoke to Anki do sing
Eat the food Anki do
Do you remember when you had a second grade reader
Ride and it was like, you know
Almost 666, not quite
When you had your second grade reader
And it was Jack and Jill
And they're going up the hill
Why, it's a fetch a pail of water
Ride and all that kind of stuff
And you're following blah blah blah
What kind of school instruction booklet
Would this be, probably about third grade
Eat the food Anki do
It is the way one lives, drink the beer
It's custom of the land, go to the next one
Go to the next one, seriously they call this epic
There's no wonder, you've got to know
That ancient Greeks stood around
And bragged about how good their language was
And how happy they were that they were not barbarians
And what was a barbarian?
Anybody, blah blah blah, whose language was not Greek
And Greek, historically, sucked them all up
Just devastated them all
What does this say?
The city, oh we're talking about Nineveh
Watch this people, more BS
The city was said to be devoted to the goddess Anana of Nineveh
Cool, and Nina was one of the Sumerian
And Assyrian names for that goddess
Cool, the Assyrian cuneiform for Nina
Which is a fish
Wait what?
Wait, what did Tommy do?
He was trying to draw Nina
And he put a fish in a house
What the hell does that mean?
What is that, I'm serious
This may have looked, they don't even know
They're like, look, this kid is, you know, he's a little bit slow
This may have simply intended place of fish
Huh, you sure it's not just the word for like fish market or something?
Or may have indicated a goddess?
Probably, possibly, Hurrian
Possibly Hurrian, oh god
Wonderful scholarship people
That's just a salad of guessery
Give me the next one, give me the next one
Nineveh was one of the oldest and greatest cities
It's two mounds, two lumps of dirt, people
Tax from the Hellenistic period
Look, notice it's tax from the Hellenistic period
Right, what do you think?
Because they're the ones who are writing
They're the educated people
And then what is the Book of Genesis
Notice then they quote the Book of Genesis
You know where the Book of Genesis is from?
It's Hellenistic
What do you think?
This is just another of the five gazillion ways
That you'd have to be completely stoned
To think that the Septuagint was originally in Hebrew
Those monist Jewish scriptures are written at a time
When that stuff doesn't exist, it's a movement
Against polytheistic Jews
Who have completely embraced Hellenism
They're perfectly happy going to synagogues with Ion
That's what they put on the God-Ion
With the zodiac around them
They're perfectly happy with that
Which is a Greek word
Synagogue
Okay, there is no Hebrew
Hebrew, ancient Hebrew was the invention
Of a monist sect that wanted to break away
From Jewish polytheism
Your ancestors were way cooler than you thought
That's what that means
Now, swallow the monism
Maybe they'll figure it out in court
Settlements
Give me the next one
Isn't it fun?
It's fun to encourage people
Let's see some of the art that these frigging geniuses came up with
Nineveh, which is two mounds of dirt
Look at this
Now look, people, I'm just saying
I could pretty much see exactly how this thing was planned out
You know, there was a dude, and he was like,
Oh, man, look at that stone
That shit is flat
You know what we're going to do?
We're going to make some figures
And then another dude said, put some sheep
Put a row sheep
And then another dude came in
And he was like, what are you guys doing?
And they're like, we're going to make some art
And he was like, you know what, put me there
And put a giant hat on me
And make everybody bring these shape to me
Make them all bring them to me
And then put some guy on the top with some holy wand
And he's like, do that
And look, look, okay
This is the culture
Whose language is not advanced enough
To come up with forms
To come up with forms that are things that
And let me show you for example
Now people say, look, here's another one
Oh, this genius, who put this together?
Giant block?
It's a giant block and we're going to make
And I know people are saying, oh, what is he doing?
That's priceless
Priceless from the dynasty
Yeah, yeah
And it's got that funny thing like at a museum
You walk around the front and you can see the different legs
Because you notice it's got one too many legs
Did you notice that?
Right, but they did manage to get
They did manage to get some belly out of it
You know why?
Because they don't have the language to go
Where I'm about to show you
What is that? Is that more?
Do we have to read it?
The majority of the tablet corpus
Oh, this is from the library
Included colloquial compositions
In the form of legislation
This is what you get with the language
Legislation, right?
We're not talking about modern advanced legislation either
We're talking about deals for building irrigation systems
And stuff like that
It's not that interesting
Foreign correspondences
Engagements, aristocratic declarations
And financial matters
It's from this that people think
Most of society wasn't literate
You can say that about this
I know I have looked at the linear B
That is the Mycenaean Greek
And when it says that there's medicine there
Because they're talking about lists of ingredients
That they're shipping places
And you'll notice the language at that time is stuck
It is stuck in this form
This non-alphabetic form
The greatest achievement
Was bringing the instrument
Whereby Greek could fully express herself
That was the achievement
That was the achievement
Let's go
Wait, let's keep reading
The remaining text contains divinations, elements, incantations, hymns
While others are concerned with medicine, astronomy
That is, they'll mention an ingredient
Don't get me wrong, these are not treatises on medicine
For all these texts in the library
Only 10
Listen to this
Only 10 contain expressive, rhythmic, literary works
Such as epics and myths
And they're calling those things epics
Epic or Gilgamesh, right?
God, seriously?
Look at the buildings, people
Look at the buildings, right?
And that's like frigging reconstructed, right?
Right?
Okay, give me the next one
Show me some more of the site
What does it look like? Yeah
Yeah, there we go
Hmm, what happened?
What happened?
What, is it the materials you're using?
Right, no, give them the picture of what they're competing with
Give them the picture of what they're...
Oh, here's the stone too, everybody says
Ooh, look at this, oh
Ooh, the relief
Yeah, okay
Okay, it's like that Egyptian garbage
And you know what, I don't work right now
In a situation where I have to worry
Any professor, get it straight, people
Any professor at a university right now
Would never say this
But they all know it
And it's kind of strange
It's kind of strange
You know what allowed art
To become so beautiful under the Greeks?
It was the language
It turns out the secrets in the language
Computing language, give me the next one
What are they competing against people?
You know what those mud hills were competing against?
They're competing against this
Right, and anytime you look at Nineveh
You're gonna see an artist reconstruction
Don't get excited
They always blow it way out of proportion
Like the movies, they always blow it way out of scale-wise
No, sorry
Just, you know, what they had construction-wise to work with
Look at what they're competing with
You can't compete with Athens
You can't compete with Athens
And you say, oh, that's stuff
That's gotta be newer stuff
No, no, no, it's not like they develop better technology
The cult on that Acropolis is old
Is old, look what they managed to do
Look what they managed to do
You know how you get to this point
Where your stone pillars
Your columns are women
Look at that
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that the most gorgeous thing that you've seen?
You know how much weight must be on that neck?
Do you think the Greeks sat around and said, you know what?
Let's put some sheep on it, let's put some people
And just carve them in
No, dude, there has to be engineering here
There's incredible engineering
Give me another one, give me another one
Look at this sculpture
Look at it
Dude, everybody has the right number of legs and arms
Yup, yup, what are you looking at?
You're looking at the progression of a language
You're looking at the progression of a language
Give me this one
Give me this one, right?
Now this statue was melted down
Because of what it was made of
It was made of gold and ivory
The statue of Athena that was there
The statue of Athena
This society that is polytheistic
And is using the Greek language
Achieves its engineering feats
Through its language
A lot of people say
And again, I'm going to say something nobody would say from university
Oh, pyramids
So, what have you got?
You've got a bunch of big blocks piled on top of each other
And what is your literature?
Oh, I'm sorry, you don't have any
You've got the Book of the Dead?
Have you read the Book of the Dead?
It's written not by a third grader, but by a second grader
Oh, Egyptianness and Egyptianness
They've got stone friggin' blocks
Big deal, they figured out how to squash enough slaves
To get those blocks on top of each other
Ooh, mystery, UFOs, bullshit
Look at a Greek temple
Did we have one more of a Greek temple?
Do you have any in there?
Did you know people, you need to appreciate this for a minute
You need to appreciate this
If you can find a temple, bring us a temple tree
Those columns
Those columns that are, you know, make up the Greek temples
You know, from a distance
When you're miles away from the temple
And you can see the thing for miles
They're built that way, right?
And you can say the same thing
You can say the same thing, that's okay, that has columns
The same thing for the pyramid, right?
But the pyramids, the pyramids are just blocks
That column has to fight an optical illusion
Because when you get a certain distance from it
It will bend in the middle
It's an optical illusion
And your temple at a certain distance will look like
What's wrong, it's a little bendy
It's very not nice to look at
Did you know the Greeks calculated how to compensate for that
So that all the way out, you could look at it
And those columns look straight
They straightened them
And how did they do that?
It was just a little bulge
It was just a little bulge
Yeah, oh God
The engineering, the engineering
Okay, let's give it, where's Lady Babylon?
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready
Here it's coming, Pavel
I'm going to give you a surprise
What was that for? Redemption
This is how they replaced hubris
Can you believe this?
Anybody who knows Greek knows that hubris is an assault baby
It's an assault
It's, oh, I can't say the R word
Get me off of here
Banana-ing, right?
Redemption, who chose that?
And what Greek slipped and went from redemption to assault?
Bad, bad form, right? Bad form
Give me the next one
Of course the Hebrew couldn't, yeah, here it is
Of course the Hebrew couldn't have a concept like hubris
It's too complex for one word
The level of their constructions are all at the level of basic vocabulary
That you need to go to kindergarten
And come home and not forget your lunch money
And you know what I mean?
It's just the basics
It's taking care of sheep
And, you know, on a very rudimentary level
And we're going to do this
Breathe these with these
We're going to get these, woo!
Right?
That's why God, who gets sick of how dumb the language is
Says in the prophet
I'm not going to send you to somebody who speaks in a complex language
I'm going to send you to the house of Israel
Right?
It was a very simple language
That ultimately got squashed
And then a group of its people
Right? Remember, people had migrated from Crete to the Levant
And those people who were involved in those migrations
Are bringing that culture with them
And all of the artifacts with it
They're bringing so much of it with them
That you can't even find the coins that don't have Athena on them
Everybody's like in Israel is like, oh, there's another Athena coin
Right?
Why? Because that was the level
Did you see Athens?
Did you see Athens?
Where do you think you want to live in antiquity?
Where do you think everybody wants to be in antiquity?
Even the Romans who were so proud of their beautiful city
Which it was beautiful
Beautifully engineered, too
Beautifully
Right?
What do you think they wanted to do?
They wanted to go to Athens, baby
Why? It's the place
It's the mind
It's the mind, man
It's good for you
Go there
Get in one of the festivals
Go through the initiation
Right? You'd be a better person
Polytheism was the way
It was when the monists took over in Judaism
Right?
That they created this tradition of these prophets
Like the one we're looking at tonight
They invented these people
They invented them
There's no other trace of them anywhere
I tell it to people like this
I tell it to people like this, look
There is no ancient Hebrew literature
Outside of what you call the Torah
Or what you call the Old Testament prophets
The Law and the Prophets
There is no Hebrew anywhere
They didn't write anything
You mean their entire civilization never figured out
Had a right, I don't know
Maybe a suicide note
They didn't write anything?
No, they didn't
They didn't
Hebrew was not only defunct by the first century
When Jesus is around
But it's been that way for centuries
It was a small, probably a small tribal language
We don't even have evidence for this
And every time they uncover something
It's got a scratch on it
Oh, it must be Hebrew
No, people
It's desperation
You don't have to do that to fulfill the monist agenda
You don't have to do that
Right? You have your own history
You have your own history
You don't have to replicate
What the monists would have you do
Because they always throw down democracy
They always overthrow democracy
It's the one thing monism is outstanding at doing
Okay, let's not say too much
Because we don't want to spoil what happens
Give me the next one
Okay, people, I want to give you a couple more names
And he says, oh, you city of blood
You bunch of liars, you're full of injustice
You're not going to what?
You're not going to undertake those hunts
You're not going to be involved in that bestiary
Give me the next one
There was no limit in the people
You know what there is wrong with Nineveh?
You know what they're doing in Nineveh?
And they're mud-frigging huts
There's no limit
This says
There's no limit to their...
Too much porneia
And it's affecting their bodies, baby
It's weakening them
Too much porneia
What's going on in Nineveh?
There's too much porneia
Next one
I love that picture, by the way
By the way, thanks, Chewie
Wait, what? Who is the guy in the back?
Who is the guy?
I'm a little creeped out about that
Can we see that one again?
Thank you, we got a feature
Chewie's art every once in a while
Who is that?
Wow, it just goes to show you
You have a nice date
And somebody like that
Can always show up, you know what I mean?
I like it, I like it
Can I have a cup of that?
I'll take two
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
What is she?
What is this city?
Are you ready for Lady Babylon?
She's pornecale
She is that beautiful prostitute
Do you know who I'm talking about?
I met a prostitute in Turkey
Before I got thrown out of a brothel
And for some reason
For some reason
I didn't listen
I drank too much
And I tried to rescue her
And it got me in trouble
It got me in trouble
Yeah, it did
Pornecale, right?
Beautiful prostitute
It's hard for you and I
To put that concept together
Have you ever known a beautiful prostitute?
This is what the modest God hates most
Beautiful prostitutes
What else?
It's okay, leave it up
Oh, hold on
I love that
You always do such beautiful stuff
It's art
Give me the next one
Look at Chewie doing gorgeous stuff
No, we gotta go back one
Gotta make sure I got everything there
Yeah, in the porneia that you've got going on
Oh, we almost missed it
You're a beautiful prostitute
What else?
Epijaris
You're epijaristic
What does that mean?
You know who follows Aphrodite around?
The graces
This porneia is epicharistic
She is full of grace
She is full of the grace
To the prostitute
Yes
Who is full of grace
And what else?
She knows those drugs
And she uses the drugs
Wait, now we're going beyond
I was trying to do it
I was trying to bring her here
Prostitute who knows the drugs
I'm getting a different picture
The thing that you may not see is
When you say this is the person
Who has that knowledge of the drugs
It means they're a poisoner
And they can kill you
By lighting a candle
Where'd she go?
Oh, shit, she's not here
Next thing you know
You wake up in the forest and there's
Orifices that have been places
While you were asleep
Yeah
Yeah
It's a reality, man
You give those witches the ability
You open that part of the brain up
And you have something that's frightful
And sexy at the same time
Brightfully sexy
I'm scared
But ooh
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
No, the same one
Good
And what else?
She's selling out the people to her pornaia
To her pornaia
Right?
And what are they using?
They're using her fatima coice
You see
Why does it keep mentioning the drugs?
Because the drugs and the right go
Together
When they induce the death
The orgasmic death
Right? Because for some reason
They're bringing you to climax while you're dying
Chemically
Okay, I don't know
Does something to the brain maybe?
Okay
That process
This is what we need
Give me the text again
The pornaia is what?
She's using
Those drugs
Many of which
Can kill you
Look
I'm against you
Says the Lord God
They're all powerful
Pantocrator
Right?
Zeus
Thank you Zeus, right?
That's just the title
Right?
And I will
Discover
I will show
I will take out
Of the darkness
I will reveal
Your
Opiso
What's your opiso? What's he going to do?
He's going to show that city
Right? This is God
And Nineveh
This is what the prophecy is saying
God is saying
To Nineveh
I'm going to show
Right in front of your face
I'm going to show your opiso
Your opiso
That sounds bad
Give me this one
What is that?
Ta opiso
The hinder parts
There is a strip
We have to be specific
There is a strip
Between your anus
And your genitalia
From sea to shining sea
This is what you get to see
If you're Moses
And God
Stops by
Remember
Remember the
Templars are licking
That area
The newbies get to lick that area
It's in the trials
Right? And it's got
The purple on it
Why is it? Because
When you're applying the purple to your anus
I'm talking about the
Planet
When you're applying that
Drug
Your pants are going to get stained
Your pants are going to get stained
It's so important
That that girdle
That
Aphrodite wears
You know why that has such a sharp sting to it?
It's
Full
Of what comes out
Of her vagina
And do you know what that is?
That's life
It's ionic life
The vagina of the universe
Is what gives us life
Yes, Timmy
Timmy
Develop your language
Perhaps you can describe this in some poetry
Stop hating women
Timmy
Monism is a step backwards
It's a step backwards
Let's keep looking
What else is she? Give me
I've got a couple more
Here, oh God
Just so you can ask for contrast with Inky
Inky do
Ate the food until he was sated
He drank beer
We had the food and the beer before
Seven jugs became expansive
You know, that's
That's an awfully strange translation
You know that doesn't say that
And sang
With joy
He was elated
He splashed his shaggy body
Seriously?
Okay, Tommy
Settle down
Learn how to tell some narrative, Tommy
Give that
Give it to him
What did he do?
He rubbed himself with oil and turned into a human
Tommy, now I told you
When you go to school
Where is it?
Tommy, I told you when you go
You've got to learn the right things
You've got to learn the right things, Tommy
No
No
No, give it to
They love it, don't they?
Jesus Christ, Tommy
Sorry, that was brilliant
Thank you, thank you
Hit it, no, get away from there
Let's go down here
What happens, people?
He says, God says to her
This grace-filled
Prostitute
Who is giving us all health
Salvation is health
What does he say about her?
I'll bring all this pollution
On to you
And all this dirty foulness
And I'm going to make you
A paradigma
I'm going to make you
Look at that word
Bottom line, paradigma
That's where we get paradigm
And this brings up
Our third
Hebrew inadequacy
There is no way
There is no way
That the Hebrew
With its 7,000 basic words
Can express this
You're talking about
Totally different societies
One advanced and one not
It's anthropology
Give me the next one
Watch what happens, people
Did I give them the definition?
Oh, the paradigma, no, I didn't
Check it out sometime
Check it out sometime
And what happens?
Yeah
People, Nineveh
People are going to be like in the future
Who's going to mourn you, baby?
Right? Nobody's going to be there
To help you
Because why?
Because Jehovah is beating up
Nineveh
Right?
Pimp Hashem is beating up
Nineveh
What are you picking on Nineveh for?
It's just two mounds of dirt, bro
And
What?
What?
Give me the next one
Quick, guess who shows up
To rescue Nineveh
Guess who shows up
Surprise
Surprise, measure things out
Tune up your cords
Apportion the lots
Amen
Yeah
Yeah
You know who she is
By the way, you see the third line down
I'm translating, Amen
Can you see it?
It's the first word
It's the first word
Fantastic
Amen, what are you going to do?
She's coming
What does she do?
She lives in those waters
Those waters
She's that queen of that phallus
She builds those walls
Of water Egypt
And Ethiopia
Her glory
And there's no limits
To her transit
Those Libyan women
Or her assistants
You know who we're talking about here?
We're talking about Lady Babylon
Who was the medwa
We're talking about
Medea, historically
Medea
She
Is the author and originator
Of your mystery
Yeah
Judaism, Christianity
All of it
All of it
It was an attempt
To take the cult
To take the health
And the activity of the drugs
They were using
It was all an attempt to take that
And control it
To control it
One cult
Ruling them all
Made by one woman
And who
Brings that woman
Amen
Fantastic
Give me the next one
I told you the text says
There
There
Can you see that?
Ethiopia and Egypt, don't you love that?
Why? She was traveling all throughout the region
People in Italy know her too
Right?
The entire group changes their ethnicity
You say, oh it came from Persia
Persia, my anus
Nothing came out of there
Greek
Swallowed them too
Fantastic
Love it
And then he says you're drunk
I'm not drunk, what the hell are you talking about?
Yahoo
And your people, what does Yahoo say?
Your people are like women
Do you know how big
The brain of Yahoo really is?
It's the
Equivalent of the third grader
Right? Now do you see
And I know there's a ton of women
Particularly out there who are like
Oh look, one of the stupid men
Finally caught on
Yes, I get it
And I love it
You don't need to send me pics
I don't want stuff like that
Come on, keep it straight
Let's do it
I love it and I respect you
I respect all of you
Give me the next one
There's a finger print
I just wanted you to see
This is the word bukos
Which is the word for locust
The wingless larva
Of the locust
Okay, great
No problem
Where is this particular word coming from?
It's showing up in the Septuagint
And it's showing up where else
In Cypriot
In Cypriot
So there's an influence from Cyprus
Okay
That text that is the toro
Or the Old Testament
That text was not written
By people that you
Think wrote it
It wasn't
And they didn't live when you think
They lived
History we have
That says they lived back then
Is from the theologians
Who have to say they lived back then
Or that document is not history
And it's not
It's not
There's no other proof
If it were, there would be evidence
There would be quotes
Things that have the Egyptians would have made a giant
Skip you to the
Skip you to the
Moses followers
You know what I mean?
They had their art
Don't get me wrong, I've been to Egypt
I've been to the pyramids
It was gorgeous
I've been down the Nile on a train
And I've been to the
I've been to the Karnak
And all that kind of stuff like that
Don't get me wrong
It's impressive stuff, but baby
Baby
The sophistication
The art
It's got to come from the language
It's got to come from the language
Yeah
Not all languages are created equal
They're not
Mother Greek, we love you
I appreciate you coming tonight
I want everybody to know
Everybody to know
I know I skipped Dom and used
Presentation and material
I'm sorry
I'm going to be lagging a little bit
And I know people are sending me applications
I still have a giant list of people
To try to shove into classes
I'm still trying to do that
So
Stay tuned
I'm going to pack those classes
The best I can
Not until it's uncomfortable
Eight or nine students
Then it starts getting uncomfortable
I know
And I'm getting your email
I know people are like, I don't know
I didn't hear anything
And it's, you know, don't worry
It'll come
Keep reading your text
Please
Your intensive text
And I will get with each of you
I promise you
We just need a little bit of time
And a little bit of patience
Thank you for me
The Aussie group is coming together
I'm going to send out their
Acceptance this weekend
And that'll be class
So
Thank you for everybody who is
Working hard
There's a great new
Video that came out
By
What was his name?
He was a bald guy
A bald guy with tattoos
You're going to love it
Can you post that?
Chewy, thanks
A bald guy with tattoos
He's better looking than me though
So he's
He did a show
And he also happens to turn out he's a
Linguist, you know what I mean
And so
He says, you know, hey
I want you to hear it because
I don't want you to hear it from my mouth
I want you to hear it from somebody else
Who's
Makes me not look crazy
But makes the
Image that you get
Through the theology
And he's exactly right
And the actual history
Is always way more interesting
So kudos
I'll get his name and I'll throw it out there
He was doing
He does a lot of stuff
Got a ton of videos, he's got like thousands of videos
Hey, old boy
No, it's not old boy
Right, no, but hey
So I'll get him posted
See if he can get his name real quick
Can you get his name?
No, we shouldn't, we should have prepped that
Clip
Okay, on the community tab
Chewie says we'll get that on the community tab
So keep an eye out for that because it's a great
Interview of somebody who actually
Does languages and not just
So that he can have a job
At a university and appear
To do languages, right, real
You know, decent, I like that
I have kudos, kudos to people
Thank you
Satanic congregation for coming
Tonight, I think that
Our progression
To the reality
Is, I think
We're getting there and I'm
Going to keep bringing it and I'm just
Going to new, I promise
People new stuff, a couple of people said
Hey, he already mentioned that before
Okay
Okay, we're always going to drag
Along Jesus and the naked kid
Right, that he was arrested with
We're always going to bring that along
Right, you're always going to be
Looking at the right
With that in the back of your mind
But what you need is the new stuff
And there's so much out there
There's so much creepiness
And I'll dig deep for you
We're going to go creepy
Thank you for hanging in and
Hail Satan
We're breaking stars
Find the rain rhymes
But you won't hold the flame
A pena in the sky
Diamond sharp
On a magic cover
A fly, the man who laughs
Will mess
Day to wake up
Make these bitches jump
Posse out on Broadway
Dr. Doom
Face gone blue
She moved on up
If you forget the face
Magic is the best thing
Wish you could have
She moved on up
If you forget the face
Magic is the best thing
Wish you could have
Jesus Creepers
Martina
Jesus Creepers
