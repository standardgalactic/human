Omnia is silenced
They sell you knock off Jesus
Vaccineally is a real mystery
Your poster boy pedophile drug addict was made by Rome
To enslave all of you
Knock knock, can't you hear me? I'm at the door

Welcome back to Lady Babylon
And what I predict will be the most feather-ruffling show we've ever had tonight
So buckle up, Satanic congregation
I thank you for coming
I thank you for coming
I want to make a couple of announcements
Before we begin, thank you, Teddy Bates
I want to make a couple of announcements
I'm getting a lot of requests
And thank you for those
Love it, love it
People are saying
Where is Amen you?
Amen you is coming
Amen you is coming
I have to push first to get you
Amen you
And we'll go from there
Soldiers
You'll notice the tone is changing
A little bit at Amen you
And you'll notice that
Well the instruction is rather
Drill-ish
Yes, oh God
Because we need everybody on their toes
With the Greeks so that we can
Access the library
Right, we are at that
Renaissance
That seed is just about to sprout
Just about to sprout
For all you people in future studies
Oh God, this was the year
Oh I love it
So more to come
It's coming and it will come
And everybody can be involved
In that who wants to be
And it'll be fantastic
The museum
The integrity of the museum
Must be held
As our
Distinct privilege
I want to say a thank you
To all of the people
From discordia
Who have been working
So hard
And the talent by the way
You know I know not everybody
Was privileged to be there
But this was a show
That was playing out in front of me
That was just gorgeous
Full of integrity
Hopping with artistic beauty
The music was gorgeous
This is people composing
Performing music
The poetry was exquisite
This is stuff written
This is salon
You're creating an environment
And you did
So tonight
After Lady Babylon
I will meet
With the round table
And I will give you
The words of Omnia
Fantastic
Fantastic I'm looking forward to that
So right afterwards
On tonight's show
We're gonna have
Gnostic Informant come
Gnostic Informant's gonna come
And inform us
Fantastically
So wait for it
When I'm done with my section
I'm gonna call him in
Love it, love it
Everybody who's been involved
Will thank you
Thank you
So I promise you
Because I know you're
Satanic congregation
I know what you're looking for
This is the dirty stuff you want
This is the stuff
That will cause controversy
This is the edge
They called it
The last wild frontier of classics
Who said that?
The London Times
This is the edge
Tonight I am going
To bring to you
The big lie
Yeah, this is it
This is bigger than big
This is the one
That changed history
Without it
The timeline degenerates
We fall back to that classical well
We wake up and we see
We see indeed the best thing
To do is to serve the muse
Tonight I'm going to show you
I'm gonna do something very
Straightforward and simple
I know everybody has time constraints
So here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna value your time
And I'm gonna say
We're going to look at
Isaiah chapter three
Isaiah chapter three
But we're gonna look at it
In the way that you've never looked at it before
We're gonna look at it
In the original language
In which it was written
Which is Greek
And you're going to see
How the translation slope
From higher tech
To lower tech
Is downward plummet
You're gonna see it
Oh God, what are we gonna do?
I'm gonna show you those texts
For the first time
Are you ready for this?
And I want you to see
How the big lie changed history
And you happen to be swimming in it
Right now
You're swimming in it
Is everybody on the throne?
I forgot to tell us
Get out now, everybody
We gotta get out
This ship is landed
We're going into the zone
But on tonight's mission
I want you to taste the big lie
Here we go
Are you ready?
Get me up the first
This is who we're looking at
Hesaias
Oh, you say it so strangely
Hesaias
Oh, love it
This is Isaiah
Isaiah
And Isaiah is going to
Prophecy for us
He's gonna tell us
Like prophets do
He's gonna tell us about
Yahoo
And about what Yahoo's gonna do
To these people
Who are dancing with their
Wait a minute, what?
Okay, hang on, right?
We always go to cult sites, right?
You didn't think I wouldn't bring you to
A place that wasn't cult
Because I know what you love, baby
I know what you love
You love these dingy cult drug parties
Yeah, it's fantastic
Don't get me wrong
We hang out together
And I appreciate that
I appreciate that
Let's go to the next one
Bring that up
What am I doing?
I'm showing you Isaiah 3
I'm first gonna show you
In the native Greek
And we're gonna look at technical terms
Look at this
Pay attention
Says the Lord Despot
Who rules Saba
He's gonna take away
From those Judeans
And from those Jerusalemites
Every strong man
And every strong woman
Is gonna take the strength
Of your bread and water
Okay, now, that was the translation, right?
Applause, Chewie
We need some kind of applause
No, yeah, not really
What does, pray tell
What does the Hebrew make of this
Because what you're looking at
What I'm gonna show you
Is the Hebrew translation
Of that Greek text
Now, that gets us into a little background
You can brainwash them with pictures now
That gets us into a little necessary background
There's a letter
And this letter is a forgery
But the letter states
That the people
Who wrote the
Septuagint
That was a group of rabbis
72 of them, I've got 72 slides tonight
72 of them, and they got together
And by the power of Yahu
They all came up with the same translation
Wonderful, just a beautiful, beautiful fairy tale
But that fairy tale was meant
For a reason
What I'm gonna show you now
Is the translation of that
Into Hebrew, which remember
This is the third century
Okay, third century
Hebrew's been dead
As dead as dead can get
I want to ask you
Before we begin this
Before I show you the Hebrew
Now, I want to ask you
Give me the name
Of one Hebrew author
Outside of the Septuagint
In Greek
The TLG will tell you
We've got a good standard, 4000-ish
Okay
If you were to take all the names
Of all the authors that are quoted
From the ancient text that we've got
You've got thousands upon thousands
Give me the name
Of one Hebrew author
Outside of the Old Testament
Give me one name
Surely they have medical writers
Everybody's got medical writers
Even the Egyptians
Have medical writers
And you say
Oh, well, the Egyptians were
Hu-ha-boo-ha
This is literature
We're talking about writing
This is evidence
We're not here for ideas
We're here for evidence
Yes, okay
So, let's see what happens
When you take that
And now you're trying to forge
Tonight's show is all about forgery
And fraudulence
If you were fraudulent
You'll be found out
Tonight on The Big Lie
Oh, I love it
It sounds like a detective show or something
I love that
Who is that, Chewie?
Is that a saint?
Is that a saint?
Oh, it's Isaiah
There he is
Thank you
He's got a nice desk
I like that
Nice job, Isaiah
Okay, let's keep going
Give me the next one
Because it's the Hebrew now
That we're going to jump to
Go, hit it
Oh, first the new international version
See now the Lord
The Lord Almighty is about to take
From Jerusalem and Judah
Both supply and support
All supplies of food
And all supplies of water
Okay, terribly off
From the Greek
What happened to the strong man
And the strong woman?
Because ladies
You're going to love it
It's all full of women tonight
Remember, Yahoo!
Loves child sacrifice
And hates women
Right?
This is blatant, bold
Misogyny
You know why he hated them here
And Isaiah?
Because they were ruling
They were argumentists
Are you kidding?
They're rulers?
Take them out
Yes, yes
That you have to remember
Don't forget Yahoo
And I'm going to show you the name Yahoo
And why I say Yahoo
Hit it, where's Isaiah?
Get that
Get the thing on here
Oh, Prophet's buttocks
That's what we have
A Prophet's buttocks
Love it
Okay, go to the next one
What is that new international version
Based on?
All the English is going to be
Based on the Masoretic
Hebrew fiction
Of the 9th and 10th centuries
Okay, that's what it is
Remember the Dead Sea Scrolls
Everybody thanks the Dead Sea Scrolls
Were like, you know, Hebrew originals
Now, why do you think they found them with Greek?
Because the Greek texts have been long established
Yes, it's the sad fact of one laying
Which dying when another comes in
And totally takes it out
Yes, oh, it was a slaughter
My God, what Greek did
And to how many languages did Greek do it?
Oh, God
People think Alexander the Great
Spread Hellenism
I got news for you
He spread the language
And the language consumed
Consumed it, set the people on fire
Right?
Love it
Love the language, go to it
Go to it, yep
Here's the Hebrew now
Okay, here's the Hebrew
Blow it up for me, Chew
I gotta get my glasses
So here's that same verse, you know
Who's the Lord we're talking about here?
Yahweh, see Yahweh there?
That's Kourios, right?
People love to translate that
It's Yahweh
Some of the things that you see
Like they'll use one word in Greek
To translate two different Hebrew words
Right?
So get ready for the vocabulary skill
To drop through the floor
Are you ready?
Yeah, so behold the Lord Yahweh
The Lord of hosts
Takes that Sabbath, right?
Takes away from Jerusalem and from Jordan
What is this?
The stock in the store
What happened to my dude and my dudeette?
What happened to them?
They got rid of them
They got rid of them
That's interesting
What happened?
Let's keep going
See if this mystery will pull itself together
Give me the Hebrew term
What is the Hebrew term we're concerned about?
Mission, a support or staff
That has nothing to do with a person
Whoever was translating this from the Greek
Had to rely upon much more simpler expressions
Why?
Because at the time Greek was liturgical
I mean Hebrew was liturgical
There's nothing they could do
There's Greek all over the walls of your synagogues
Right?
So this is a Hebrew problem
Not a cultural or historical problem
The Hebrew language was inadequate
It was inadequate
So I'm going to show you technically
How a language that has less technical terminology
And is functioning at a lower level
Can't bear the signal of that high tech
And we're going to prove that tonight with a purple
Oh, I love it
Love this stuff
Okay, let's go
Thank you people for coming
Thank you, Gnostic
I will be there
Go to the next one
And look, this is verse two
What else is the...
Is Yahu going to take from everybody?
Look at verse two
He's going to take the giants
And he's going to take the strong
And the person who is the war trained
And the diecast
He's going to take what?
The diecast
I'll tell you, hang on to that thought
What else is he going to take?
He's going to take the prophet
The prophet
Wait, what's a prophet?
Let's see
Then he's going to take the stochastain
And the old person
The elder, you could say
He's going to take all that stuff away
Because those are the resources of those communities
Now, let's see what the Hebrew text does with this
Let's see
I think I got a picture of you, Chewie
What the Hebrew text does
Yeah, there we go
Oh, here we go
The mighty man and the man of war
Right?
So I just got to warn you
The Greek here used a very specific adjective
Indicating a type of person
Who has been trained in the arts of war
The Hebrew has to use much more simpler
Man of war
Right?
Do you hear how the level of specificity drops?
Yes, okay, keep going
They got the elder right
Wait, what else did they put there?
I forgot to...
Oh, they say the judge and the prophet
And the diviner and the elder
Right, they got the elder in there
Let's see about the others
Let's bring me up
Let's see how close they hit
Roger that
Let me see how close they got
Here's the man of war
Right?
That ish of war
Right?
Ish and Isha, right?
Look at the simplicity of the expression
Hit me the next one
What is that in the Greek original?
Yeah, it's specifically somebody trained
In the arts of war
It is a technical station or post
Give me the next one
Yeah, you can come back to that
Go ahead
Yeah
Boom
What is the war?
Is it anything specific?
Or is it just kind of just...
No, it's just battle of war, right?
Mahama
Okay, go to the next one
Cool
All right, I'm feeling it
What is it?
What is that?
That's a judge
So, on the Hebrew side, they got the judge part
But I want you to look at this word
How much more specific
We've got to go
Look, in Athens
Just notice where we are
It's a linguist
Notice where we are
In Athens, it means a juror
Okay
Can it mean a judge?
Yes, it's a juror
It's also this thing
It was very popular in the ancient world
The Avenger
The Avenger, right?
That's a servant of DK
That's as pagan as it gets
The Avenger, right?
Great, go to the next one
That's what our diecast is
What do we get on the Hebrew side?
It really is coming from this verb, right?
It's non-specifically judging or governing
Now, my problem is
The Greek already has a verb
For one who sits in judgment as a governor
And I think that's what this is probably closest to
And they would have known that
If I know that, they would have known that
In antiquity
Yeah, their linguists are great, right?
Classics is the first education
Yeah, love it
The museum comes from it
Okay, so we're going from the specific to the general
When we go from the Greek to the Hebrew
Now, remember, the story is
That it went from Hebrew to Greek
So as you're thinking about these translations
Realize what the person who would be translating it
Into Greek would have to do to ramp up
That technical expertise, right?
You either can do a triple lutz or you can't
And Hebrew was not able to do the triple lutz
And it's not the only language
There's a ton in Italy
All those dialects that the Romans wiped out
Linguistically, same thing
There are strong languages and there are weak languages
Yeah, love it
Now, here's your prophet, people
What else did he say he's going to take from him?
Prophets, I just want you to notice
Okay, this is one who speaks for God
That sounds pretty good
I want you to notice how many references there are
To different classical works that use this Greek word prophet
Prophet, okay
Notice, blow it up
Notice that it's a herald, sure
Look at the very bottom
Go to the next slide
What does it say?
It says herbalist
You mean your prophet is an herbalist?
I would have one objection
Yes, but it's more in a medical sense
So I would say pharmacologist
Yeah, that's what I would put it
You mean your prophets were on dope?
Yes, they were
Yes, they were
Love it
Go to the next one
Look at the three and four year people
An expounder of the utterances of the mantis
You guys know the mantis and the mantic art
You know that, that's all through Apollo
You thought the word prophet was
No, it's not Charlton Eston
No, that's a fantasy world
It's part of the big lie
We're peeling back that big lie tonight
Look at three and four
You know, a possessor of irracular powers
Look at where they're going
They're going to the oracles
Look, it's used of epimenides
He was a cool guy who had tattoos all over himself
And he would carry this cult's hoof
And in it, he would put this white root
That he would snort
Yeah, yeah, they kept his skin
Turned it into a book
Why not?
Go to the next one
Let's go to the next one
Are people commenting?
I'm going to get people's comments in a minute
Chewie, if there's any good comments, throw them up there
Look, people, what is the prophet on the Hebrew side?
A spokesman, a speaker
Okay, but then you're using a Greek term to define your Hebrew term
Because you're saying prophet
That's a Greek term
Yeah, so do you see the depth here?
I asked you before, could you name me one Hebrew author
From antiquity outside
And I'm not talking, I'm talking BC
Okay, outside of the Septuagint
Give me one, I don't know, a seventh century dude
You thought Isaiah was eighth
Then certainly, if Isaiah is late iron age
Are we going to have some kind of record?
Are we going to have some kind of written?
No, you're not, because the stuff doesn't exist
The oldest inscriptions of Hebrew
People question them as even being Hebrew
Right?
Yeah, it's not the history that you thought was there
It was the history that was amplified that you've been fed
That you're living in
That you're breathing
Yes, okay, go, keep going
Let's give Isaiah another spanking
Let's go, people, love it while you can
While it's hot
Which one?
Okay, here we go
And what is the stohas on?
That's just something, a conjecture
I like that, I like that
Look where it says
That's Polybius they're talking about
And is he roughly contemporary?
Yeah, he's in the same range
From where our authors of the Septuagint are
So the person who really wrote the books of Moses
In the third century
We're getting closer to their specific lingo
And this is one of the words, fantastic
What's he gonna do?
He's gonna take away the people who can come up with the right plan
Right?
He's gonna take that away
It's a resource, I told you these are all resources that he's got there
It makes much more sense in the Greek
Than it does the terrible dumb-down Hebrew translation
It's a shame, this is a beautiful text
Here we go, what's the word for it?
That they're using for that
They're using this one
And what does that mean?
Want to practice divination
Are you kidding me?
Okay, what does that mean?
That's not a definition
It's not a definition, it's like a catch-all
Okay, what car are you in?
Well, I'm driving, thanks
Yeah, it's very nonspecific
And that's the problem, because remember Hebrew only has about 8,000 unique words
Right? They miss basic words
Why don't we have them?
Because it got slaughtered as a language
It was only the attempt to bring it back
Starting in the second century
The synagogues are still full of Greek
People realized, oh, we need some kind of original
To take command of this text
Yeah, yeah, isn't that something?
And so they wrote it, they created it
They were already doing it with the Dead Sea Scrolls
Right, they had the Greek originals there
And they had the Hebrew copies of them
Okay, watch this, watch how technical language
It shows it every time, it's the technical language
Hit me with the next one
Are you sure that far?
Okay, yeah, look at verse number 3
Who else is Yahu going to remove from society?
Look at the first word on the second line
Pente con tarjon
Pente con tarjon
What is that? Sounds important, right?
Look at the length of that
People, I don't do this always, but just love the length
Of that first word on the second line
Can everybody see that?
Love the look at that
How many?
I'd like to measure that word
I'd like to measure it
I would
It might cause some frightening reactions
It's gorgeous, isn't it? Pente con tarjon
Oh, it even sounds
It sounds like, I don't know
I don't know, it makes me want to, you know
Put on some music
Sorry, I got drawn in
And what else is Yahu going to take away?
He's going to take away the Pente con tarj
The what?
He's going to take away a specific position
What is that thing? Let's see
Let's see, Chewie, give me the next slide
What is that? Looks like it's got the word five
Give me the next one, this one
No, there we go, that's it
Look at this, people, commander
It's a commander of how many?
Of fifty, right?
Fifty!
Look where it's landing
It's landing in Xenophon
And he tells us this is somebody who serves under the Trierachos
This is the Trierachos
Yeah, and what does he do?
He's like an admiral?
Yeah, he has to outfit a tri-rame
Yeah, yeah, so this is a very specific, once again, Athenian word
Okay, let's see what the Hebrew did with it
Let's see, let's see
I'm willing to bet it's not nearly as specific
Blow it up, yeah, put it up there and blow it up
This is fantastic
Oh, God, what's the jury say?
Look, the captain of fifty
So use the number fifty and put the word for captain in there
Because you don't have this position, right?
So do you see, for the Greek to be a translation of the Hebrew
The dude would have to be stoned
He would have to be like, oh, God, how can I jazz this up?
How can I, you know what I mean?
So the captain of fifty, that's not real
That's not real inspiring, right?
But it's blunt and to the point, it's blunt and to the point
It's a loss of technicality
And watch as you wash out the technicality
It becomes nonsense, the translation becomes nonsense
And by the way, you can do this with any chapter of the Septuagint
Right, you might as well throw a dart at which chapter
And whatever you hit, try that
It's full of laughs, linguistic laughs
Oh, it's hilarious, it's hilariously bad
It's also sad, I feel like playing a violin or something
Give me the next one, give me the next one
Yeah, there's the captain of fifty, we know, we saw that
Let's go on to the next
Okay, and there's our commander who's serving under the tree of Ark
Yeah, okay, keep going
What else is he going to take?
He's going to take away the Sumbulon
Oh no, this is fantastic
Give me the definition that's coming up
What is a Sumbulon?
Watch this people, this is going to grow your brain
This is an advisor or counselor?
Okay, public or private, cool, that's cool
Look at all the sources around it
And you're going to notice, Athenian, fifth century
The majority, the first order is up there
The first comedian is up there
Yeah, the first Tragedian is up there
And a bunch of others
Oh god, oh god, look at it
As a title at Athens, the Thesmothetai
Okay, the Thesmothetes
They're the ones who appointed the Sumbuloi
And this is what Yahoo is going to take from you
Now, who is you?
The audience of this
Our third century disenfranchised culturally
Jewish religious extremists
Right, these are the guys in the caves
Copying documents
Right, brilliant move to do so
Because when you generate the big lie
You take a hold of the narrative
It gives you grounding and justification
To do whatever you want to do
And that usually involves the seizure
And acquisition of some land, some resource
That's how that works
Yeah, now, how can I say that?
Because that's exactly what they do with the language
If you look at the language as a resource
That's what this is doing
It's trying to draw down
That's what the Hebrew is doing
It's trying to draw down that sophisticated Greek
But put it into a vessel that was incapable of carrying it
It was too much
Right, burst the pot
Okay, let's go
Hit me the next one, let's hit it
Oh, yeah, here we go
This is the council, fine
To advise or to counsel
Right, okay
I think that's acceptable
Let's give them that one
Nice job, nice job
Whoever did this, nice job
What about this one?
What do you guys do with the Arhidektona?
Isn't that a good one?
Look, that's a big one too
Everybody in Greek, you see the Arhe
Sitting in there in the tekt
Oh, that production
Production is getting to me
It's from the Arhe
So how are we going to define it?
Stretch your mind
Everybody
The chief artisper
Artificer, excuse me
The master builder
The director of works
This is the guy who builds your bridges
It says in Greek
It's got Herodotus
It's got Aristotle
Look, where are we again?
Vocabulary wise people, where are we again?
We're hitting square
Every time at the fifth century
Down to the third
We're hitting it square
This is the exact language
That we would expect
Coming out of the third century
Exactly
An author, a contriver
And look at the final one
At Athens, by the way
This is the manager of the state theater
And of the Dionysia
Great festival ride
He's going to take those away from you
And you say, wait a minute
Where am I culturally?
Because unless
I am mistaken
The people of Israel do not
worship Bacchus
And that's who he's talking about
He goes on, the prophet
Isaiah goes on to talk
About those assemblies that we make
Those parades that we make
And all the women are there
And you've got your girls out
And they're gossamer clothing
And we're all getting aroused
Why aren't they
And burkas?
Right?
That's the, that's
Isaiah 3
It's Bacchic rites
So you have to ask yourself
Why in a text
Am I reading about Bacchic rites
In Judea?
Right?
Isn't that something?
Isn't that something?
Remember, we are sitting
In the third century BC
And we have been
Culturally disenfranchised
And a lot of us became traders
And embraced
The Greek ways
Yeah, now they're
Doing what they're doing
Totally integrated
Right?
If you are an extremist
You understand
The power
Of the logos
That's what they used in antiquity
Those histories, that material
From the libraries
Yeah
That was the reality
So when somebody comes along
And tries to fake
A text and say
This is the original
They're doing it for a very good reason
Right?
Legitimacy
When you need legitimacy
And are willing to sacrifice
Everything for it
You fabricate
Now
It's an unfortunate reality of history
Don't think that the Christians
Didn't
Mount up that wave
And ride it all the way in
Even though people like
Afrikanis, Julius Afrikanis
Was saying, this text is not written
In Hebrew
You people are nuts
In origins like, yeah
That's all he could do
He just shrugged
He shrugged it off, what do you want me to do?
Right? Let's ride this thing
It's too bad
We care at Satanic initiation
Because that's not the history
That's not the history
The history is this text is Greek
Originally
Yeah
It's got some things in it
Let's go to the next one
Let's convert
Everybody
It's the lanes are full of
Here's your skillful artisan
So I want you to notice
Okay, we've got a term
Equated with
An artisan who's skillful
Just want you to notice that
You get a taste for where the culture is
Right?
Now where did they get their word?
Craftsman
Okay, so wait a minute
This is a name, it's actually a proper name
Right?
It's not based upon the
Action of a craftsman
Has nothing to do with the history
Of the craftsman, it's a name
Maybe they were a family
Of craftsman
So you can see that
The derivation
Of that word is kind of questionable
Questionable at best
Right?
And you'll find that a lot
In the Hebrew translation of the Septuagint
You'll find that
The more you go
And do your lexical work
You'll find they don't really know what this word means
Right?
And if you only have 8,000
Unique words, that's a huge problem
You mean you got a percentage of those words
That
You know, we think we understand
But yeah, no, it's a bad
It's a bad place to be
So
You know, hey, languages
Just aren't born equal
That's the way it is
Some of them dominated and some of them didn't
Okay, let's go to the next one
Isn't language beautiful though?
Okay, what else are we looking for?
As Jehovah
Is going to be taken out of the world
He's going to be taken
That craftsman
He's going to be taken
That wise craftsman
And he's also going to be taken
The knowing akroaten
What is an akroaten?
Next one, please
What is he going to be taken?
He's going to be taken these away
Now, what is this?
What is this?
It's a person who hears
Are you ready?
This is really native Greek
Right, really native Greek
Yeah
And when I say that, I just have to mention
By the way
There was a language
Discovered in northern
Turkey
That is descendant
From the
Greek
Of Hellenistic Greece
They still speak it
They don't have anything recorded of it
But they still speak it
And what's funny
As I've been telling you
Modern Greek is nothing
Is nothing close
Okay
Don't fool yourself
It's not
I worked with modern Greek
Students in classics
Right
And they would be the first
To tell you
It's a whole different ball game
But this language
They just discovered in northern Turkey
It is
A sister language
To the Hellenistic
Greek
And they gave a couple of examples
Grammatically how it is
And some uses of infinitives
I thought that was nice, elegant
And the funny thing was
In the article they said
And it's jowdely unrelated to modern Greek
Like there's no
No overlap whatsoever
I thought that was
I thought that was
I'm telling
I'm sorry modern Greek
I'm sorry it's a language
But that's what happens when you take
A 14 year old
And put her in a habit
And put her into a prison
And put her out to bloom
That's what happens
Linguistically that's what happens
Okay let's get back on it
Speaking linguistically
Next one let's go
Where these people want their values
Where they said I was going to ruffle some feathers
Look at this what is the word for it
Whispering or charming
Whispering or charming
What is that here
Isn't that really a whisper or a charm
Or go back to the last one
Boom look people
Look at the
Second line in A
A disciple and a pupil
Right?
A disciple or a pupil
And
My goodness look at Roman numeral number two
A reader
Are you kidding me
A reader okay so this is one of the
Things they're going to be taking away
This is not something
That the Hebrew was able to recognize
So the Hebrew used instead
A whispering or a charming
As a noun
Okay
Not the same thing
Definitely not the same thing
Go to the next one
We're starting to degrade here
Now watch it's going to get worse
And I'll hurry up here because I know
We've got ten minutes
My people
My people what
The praktoris
Are
Taking everything from you
The praktoris are taking everything from you
Yes
And what's worse is the
These are the people
Who are ruling you
Says
Isaiah no what are
What's up
Who are praktoris
Let's see
Who are praktoris right
They're officials
Execute a judgment for debt
Okay again
Highly specific word
This is a
Societal position
A civic position if you will
Right somebody
Who's coming to collect the debt
Right looks like
Taxes are also involved
Okay give me the next one
What go back to that one
How does the Hebrew
Handle this
Okay as for
My people
Their oppressors
Are children
Wait is this the same line
Yes it's the same line
And women rule over them
Wait a minute that wasn't any
Of the Greek
What's happening here
There's going to be no word
For this position because there wasn't
That position when
The Hebrew was around
To be able to assimilate it
So they didn't have it
So what do you use
You use something general like oppressor
Oppressor
Well okay
Where are you getting the children
Go back to the Greek verse
Where are they getting the children
My people
Those who control
The retrieval of debts
They're going to be all over you
And who are going to rule over you
The Apitun Tess
Give me the next one
Boom
Yeah
Here we go, what is it to
Apiteo
It's to demand something back
To get something to be
Returned
Okay look at it in the passive
I think this is neat
To be demanded in payment
To be
Demanded in payment
Okay so these are people
Who are the people
Not only are they going to come to collect their debts
Right
That you've got with them
But they are also going to show up and be all mouthy
Yeah
Yeah
Oh my goodness
This is terrible news right
Let's see
I still don't see the Hebrew was way off
What's the Hebrew
People, okay
The mouthy
Are these people
Women
How is the translator
Remember, now the story is
In this letter of Aristias
The yahoo blessed
This event of translating
From the Hebrew to the Greek
So for some reason
When they went from the Hebrew woman
Yeah
Got to an oppressor
Who
Comes and takes away your furniture
While yelling at you
Okay
This is not a good translation
You cannot go
From a lower level
Of technical expertise
Linguistically to a higher
You can't do it
Yeah
You can only reach the equivalent
Or less
And if you don't have
A highly technical language
You aren't going up that ladder
You only have 8000 words
Hebrew
You had your guts beaten out of you
By ancient Greek
Man that dominated the world
Don't worry they even went over
And gave it to those up dwelling Romans
Oh god
You know what Marcus Aurelius
Read, he read Greek
He wrote in Greek
And he was the Roman emperor
Why would he do that?
Because number one he was on drugs
And the drugs were making him smarter
And the creek
Was a necessary component
It was a catalyst that just made the whole reaction
Take off
Yeah
Oh god
It's amazing history
I love it
Nobody wants to see the dirty stuff
You do
My congregation
Hurry up
Let's go
Verse 13
I just wanted to show you
Something that's colloquial
That it's colloquial in Greek
Not in Hebrew
Verse 13 says
Now the Curios
Established a judgment
He
Brought a judgment
Upon the people
And it's using a verb
Which is based upon
The concept of standing
But it's been augmented
By the kath
To become established
To ground
To ready
Something
Yeah, and this is what the Hebrew do with that
Oh it's terrible
This is a slaughter
Turn away for those of you who have weak linguistic stomachs
Blow it up
Blow it up
He stands up
There's yahoo
Now look at yahoo
You can't tell that it's written that way
Could be yahoo too
So don't get mad at me
When I say yahoo
Thank you
And by the way
They use different ways to translate
For yahoo
Hashim
They use different ways
Of translating that from one
Greek term
Why would they do that thing?
Because they're composing it in the third century
And they're trying to split
They're trying to create their own
Identity
You can't just list
It looks like Greek
As they were trying to figure it out
They probably draft one and they were like, no way
That is way too
Transparently Greek
Right
Love it
Lo, amen is the man
I love that, thank you, that was a good one
Don't put any of the bad ones up
Alright, unless I'm going to hell
Let's go to one more
Keep going
Down wherever we were from last time
Yeah
Are we on the right?
Okay
Yeah, the schema, he's going to take this away too
We got to go back up
We missed a couple here
Hang on people, I'm sorry, I apologize
I have messed up my order here
Okay, there we go
What was the translation of that passage?
The translation is
The Lord stands up
No, it's a Greek idiom
Establishing justice
Right, is to
Rule
Yeah, is to bring that authority
To literally establish that authority
So there's no
There's no standing up
There's no actual standing up
Yeah, otherwise the Greeks
Wouldn't use that idiom
Right, they could just say that
The Lord stood up
Right, what you can see
Is the attempt of the rabbis
To draw down
The more sophisticated or complex
Greek into the
Limited capacity Hebrew
Unfortunate, it's an unfortunate
Linguistic exercise
Let's go to that one, good
Look at this people, verse 17
And God, watch this
Yeah
God's going to do what
He's going to humiliate
Those daughters of Zion
Who rule
Wait, what?
What?
Who's ruling?
Who are these women?
I'm starting to like this a little bit better
And Caicurios apocalubse
And the Lord
They may put
Yeah, they may not
It's whatever the particular circumstances were
Caicurios
And the Curios did what
He's going to do what?
He's going to apocalypse
He's going to reveal
What's he going to reveal?
He's going to reveal their schema
He's going to reveal
The schema
Of these daughters
Of Zion who are ruling
And you say
What is this schema?
What is he going to reveal of theirs?
Now watch this, it gets dirty
It's the Hebrew that makes it dirty
Not me, go ahead
What is this schema in Greek?
It's a form
It's a form of something
Right, a shape, they have
Look at B, it's an atom
Yeah, it's the appearance of something
As opposed to the reality
The appearance of something
And then look down at B
It's the dress or equipment
Do you know what he's going to do?
He's going to take away all that
Fine dress
And equipment
Of those ruling women
Now, let's see what the Hebrew
Made of that
Do we get it through?
The message comes through
Are you ready?
What?
Therefore he will strike with a scab
I know
That first part of the Hebrew
Is just the word and
I don't know where they're pulling
If you can even do that
With what?
I don't know
Okay, wait
Look
They used adonai
Here
So, they really
Don't know how to use
That Greek word properly
And they're cramming all of these gods
Into it, okay
Just wait, maybe they felt good
Because of Adonis, I don't know
But the Lord is going
To strike with a scab
The crown of the head of the daughters
Oh, there he is
Yahoo
Right, and what is he going to do?
Look at the second line
He's going to uncover their secret parts
Dirty
That's what is going on
In the mind of that author
Because that's not from the Greek
My goodness
Close your eyes, Chewie
The Bible is dirty
It's dirty stuff, and first of all
Why would he do that?
Like seriously
Right?
The Greek makes sense
It says he's going to take away
Their kit, their dress
Their jewels
He's going to take all of that away
It's nothing about
Their private parts is in there
Right now, if this is
As they want you to believe
As seminaries would have
You believe
As religious training
Whatever the monotheist
Religions you want
That don't worship the gods
Like the rest of us
Right?
They're going to have
This
As a background
They're telling you
The Hebrew is being translated
By the Greek
The Greek is the new copy
Right?
That's the original language
If that says in Hebrew
About the private parts
Of these women who are
Ruling
He's going to uncover that
The translator
Had to go from private parts
To schema
Which has nothing to do
With private parts
So either it's a bad translation
And Yahoo was bad
Because remember, Yahoo blessed this thing
And it was magically turned out
Maybe everybody wrote the same translation
Of these 72 guys
So either he's a bad translator
Or
More realistically
The language is just incapable of conveying
The original Greek
It's just the way it is
Watch these technical terms
I'm going to throw you
Give me the next one
And so
What is your English translation for?
So for everybody sitting in synagogue
Sitting there and you're reading through
Blah, blah, blah, therefore the Lord
Will smite with a scab on the crown of the head
That's not there
The daughters of Zion and you'll be like
That's a nasty thing to do, right?
And the Lord will discover their secret parts
Look, it's even
Discover because you can tell
The King James, remember
It was translated as
It was a little bit uncomfortable
With the whole private parts business
Where is the chorus?
Of my sisters of frustration
Where are you?
I can't hear you
I need to hear your shouts of ecstasy
Whenever we come across
It gets my goat
That we don't hear your shouts of ecstasy
Cause that's what we're
Whoops, here I am
That's hello Penelope
You got my goat
Everybody say hi to Penelope
I don't care if you dislike this portion of the show
I want you to focus on that
Cross
I want you to look at that cross
I want you to see it
I want you to see what it's covering
That cross
Covers a whole
Multitude of Penelope's sin
Okay, enough
Thank you Penelope
Good night
Wonderful to have her
We can't be that far up, are we?
Gnostic is going to fall asleep
Keep going, give me the next couple
Look, I wanted you to see this
I'm going to cut short the rest of it
I'm just going to show you
With this passage, for example
This is verse 18, so this is Isaiah 3
18
In that day
It says, the Lord
Is going to take away the glory
Of the hematism
And long story short
That is the way that one
Dresses
And what else is he going to take away
To Cosmos
You refer to Cosmos
As the woman's makeup kit
Yeah
So it can include jewelry
It's not just the drugs that they're putting
On their faces
Skin drugs
All sorts of drugs all over the place
Including those drugs
That control reproduction
Even those
You put those in there
This is
This is your life's pharmacy kit
That's the Cosmos
It's that order
That order
And so this is what he's going to fight against
He's going to take away your hairdos
He's going to take away your hair nets
And long story short
None of these terms are captured
Give me the next one
It's terrible
The translation gets terrible
And I just want to jump
These are all Athenian too
I want you to realize these are all
Athenian terms
Again, placing the language squarely
Fifth, fourth, third centuries
Good, good, good
Give me that, I'm going to fly
Watch this, these are just things
That are there that it's hard for us to be able to capture
And they have to do
With
This little
Here, I'm going to jump ahead
To, is it this one?
Look at this, did I
Really overdo it or what?
What else is
What else is the Lord?
Here's the punchline, people
What else is the Lord going to take away?
He's going to take away
The Peripurphura
The Peripurphura
Yeah, and what else is the Lord going to take away?
The Lord's going to take away
Ta mesopurphura
Are you kidding?
These are terms
Everybody saw
This is the first term that comes up
In the library, the end of that word
Peripurphura
That's the first word
Of the great Herculaneum library
For the future historians
The great Herculaneum library
The very first word that comes out
Is that purple
Right?
And we've got it here in the text
Not only that, we're going to tax something else
On the front of the mezzo
The mesopurphura
Tell me, what does the Hebrew
Translate those as?
Blow it up
What does the Hebrew translate those as?
The rings
And the jewels with the word nose
Tagged on it
The rings and the nose jewels
Are you
Kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
Do you see what happened there?
That's a guess, bro
Whoever made that translation
Was downright guessing
Now here's the problem
The Greek actually matches
With the whole context
Because he's attacking these women
Who are priestesses
And he's attacking their validity
And he's going to take away all
Of their wardrobe
Yeah
Yeah
Nice
Gorgeous
And that purple is part of it
You know what those purple words are?
They're different terms
For using
That
Gorgeous material
Staying with the purple
Oh god
He's going to take that away
But no
The Hebrew comes along and says
No, you must be rings and nose jewels
Because everybody knows
You need the rings and the nose jewels
Yeah
Why did they do that?
I'll never know
That's a mystery of our history
Right there
They didn't want the purple
They wanted jewels
Okay
So you can see people that
The story, the narrative of
This being translated
Into Greek from the Hebrew
Is completely made up
You would have to be completely
Transformed
And just inventing things to make
I don't know the story better
Wow
Wow
Okay, let's go
I'm going to pull one out
This is the last one, Neil
And I'm coming
Are you ready for this?
This is
Boom, I was going to take you all through the purple
But instead I'm going to end with this one
Nope
There we are
Take down the initiating people
I love this
Are you ready?
Look at the verse 22
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that gorgeous?
You see that word before
The letter
For the end of the verse
Capital lambda
On the front of it
Those of you who recognize
The Greek now will see that that's
Laconian
It says that
Curios is going to take from you
Those things
We're talking about their wardrobe
Those things that you put on
It's your home
And your privacy
And what are those things
One of them is a Laconian
See-through
A diaphanous
Laconian
Nightgown
And that's what Curios
Is going to take
From you
You mean in the Bible it refers to the
Spartans?
Yeah
It does
It's being written in the third century
Right?
There's nothing novel about the Laconians
Then
Yeah
Wow
Why is Isaiah
Who supposedly is way back
Why is centuries earlier
Why is he writing about the Laconians?
That's interesting
Let's see what the Hebrew does with it
Because now this is a problem
This is a problem
This is not only a linguistic problem
Because you can't represent that in Hebrew
But it looks bad
Culturally
A lot of the changes that are made
From the original Greek and the Septuagint
To the Hebrew
Have to do with control
Of content
That's what people
Always want when they
Rewrite
They want control of content
And you guys know how it works
With the worship of the muse
Nobody controls content
You don't make your soup here
This is a pure stream
You're all gone
Yeah
Oh God
Love that
What does the Hebrew do with the Laconian?
Let's just show this because I know Neil's going to love this
Open it up
Okay what
The festival apparel
And the mantles
And the purses
Wait what were we looking for
There was something big there
There was Laconians
There's Spartans
Where the Spartans go
They cut out the Spartans
They cut out the Spartans
Okay now what they would have
You believe
Is that
You
Don't have Spartans
But the translation
Does
Because God
Is
Perfect
Yeah
I don't know
Looks like God could have gotten better linguists
To be honest
That's
Terrible
You guys blow it
Those I'm talking
You know what I'm talking to
The youth balls
Who started to
Came up with the idea
Of writing this fake letter
Of Aristaeus and saying
Look
This great person
Asked the king and the king
Was like yes I need a translation
Yes no
They didn't care
No the person
Who came up with that load
The load of the history of the Septuagint
What that did
Was that load compelled
Christianity forward
It established a legitimacy
That was strong enough
To dissolve
Classical wisdom
Yeah it's like
Some kind of acid
Ate right through it
Yeah
What you're watching is the
Monad
Take out
Because that's what it does
That's what monotheism does
It doesn't matter what color
Taste or variety it is
Monotheism
Kills
Classical civilization
The civilization that
Brought you democracy
And the scientific method
That civilization
Christianity
Islam
And that stuff they worshiped
Around Akhenaten
That stuff kills
Classical wisdom
Yes it does
It does
So
When the library start getting burned
That's when you know your temperature
Is too high
And your proportion of radicals
Is way too high
Right
It's like a 50 years
Just to bring in just the present for a second
Every 150 years says
Tom
Someone is going to try to
Pull down the government
The established government
Yeah
Yeah
And who is it
Typically
I had somebody ask me this week
Can't you combine Christianity
To include everyone
Christianity and the Abrahamic faiths
Can't you combine those
To welcome them
Julian
Who we now call Julian the Apostate
Julian
The last pagan emperor
Said
They're going to do it again
They're going to burn us down
Just like they did in the first
Yeah
It's the mission
Of monotheism
To dominate
And destroy
It's the mission
How's it coming?
The watchers are watching
By the way, did you see we had giants
And we didn't have Nephilim flying around
Right, no those are just prominent people
Thank you for coming tonight
I'm going to now give you
An added bonus
I'm going to hand
Over the stage
To
Gnostic informant
And before Gnostic informant
Starts speaking
I just want to let you know
That
His source work
Has been
Absolutely dazzling
Yeah, and I told him
I told him Neil
I told him that you
Purchased
Of the lobes
And you're eating up
You're trying to consume
Like some kind of artificial intelligence
Trying to consume everything
So you have a great
You have a great offering right now
And it's about some stuff
That I don't know
And I'm going to have to listen to your authority
Okay
Yeah man, thanks for having me on
Thanks for having me on dude
That was some interesting stuff
Just now hearing
About the linguistics side to this
Because I don't have no
I don't know anything about the linguistics
I have no
I don't have the knowledge
Of linguistics to be able to say
Who's translating from what
But those are some fucking slam dunk points
That I just heard right there
So I'm going to have to look into all that
That's amazing
I want to look at the historical side of this
Where's the evidence of
The big literary
Era
Of all these prophets and
Writers and scribes
We have prophets writing these
Long texts that are
About all these prophecies
Events that are happening
And politics and all this
So you would expect if you're writing these
You're writing to an audience right
You're writing to somebody
You're not just writing to nobody
So you would expect people
To write these texts
You would expect there to be
Like a chain of reactions to these texts
People talking back and forth
Something, anything
Well, we don't get that
So let me just say this
I want to start with
What are other people saying about
The origins of Israel
And the last time I was here
We had on
We were
We ended up on
A story about
The history of the Hebrews
It's a story that's only in a couple
Of sources I think Plutarch
Talks about it, Menetho
And then Hecateus Vabdera
His story seems to line up
With this story
It's an alternate account
And I looked into some of this stuff
And see, does this hold any water
I'm going to pull up a source from Loeb
I love this website too
This is amazing stuff
Make sure this is big enough for everybody
How's that? There we go
Actually, let me back that up
There we go. All right, so
Tacitus is telling this story
In the early 2nd century
About who are these Jews
We don't really know what's about them
They're kind of late on the scene
As far as ancient civilizations go
As far as the Egyptians
The Greeks, Punex
Phoenicians, Carthaginians
We don't know those people
They're in every text
We can find hundreds of people
Mentioning Carthage
Phoenicians, Egyptians
Ionians, Plaskians
Scythians
They're all over the place in these sources
But nobody
Ever mentions the Jews
Until
Well, okay
There's a couple of rocks that people have found
That mention certain kings
Very, very little bit
Like little city-state
So the evidence looks like this little city-state kingdom
Going on in Jerusalem
And in Jezreel
Other than that, no one's writing about these people
So what's going on here?
So let's read this story
I got a lot of things that I want to go through
But it's all going to come back
To what Ammo was saying
So he says
At the beginning of the same year
Titus Caesar, who had selected by his father
Subjugation Judea
He's basically saying like
We just subjugated this place, Judea
Let's go through the history
So he says
So this is what he says
It is said that the Jews were originally
Exiles from the island of Crete
Who settled
In the farthest parts of Libya
At the time when Saturn
Had been deposed
And expelled by Job
An argument for this
There is a famous mountain in Crete
Called Aida
Hence they had habitants called Aidaia
Which is lengthened in the Barbarian form
Udaia
Alright
Some hold that the reign of Isis
Is superfluous to the population of Egypt
On the leadership of Heroslemus
Which is in Greek
Means holy-minded
A name in Greek, it's interesting
You never hear about that
What does Jerusalem mean?
Atomology given by Tastis
It's named after a king
Named Heroslemus
And Uda
Discharged himself on the neighboring lands
And many others
Where is he getting this from?
Is this something to make up?
Just keep that in the back of your mind
It's still others report that they were Assyrian refugees
Landless people
Who first got control
Of a part of Egypt
And possibly maybe a little bit of both
Maybe the, so when I read this
My, I'm thinking the evidence shows
The Philistines
Evidence that the Philistines did come from Crete
And
The Assyrian refugees
Things sort of matches up with
These people coming together in this area
Called Canaan
So I'm going to keep continuing with this part
This is where it gets crazy
Most authors agree
That once during a plague in Egypt
Which caused bodily disfigurement
King Bacchorus
Approached the oracle of Ammon
I'm going to get to who this is in a minute
Just give me a second
King Bacchorus approached the oracle of Ammon
Asked for a remedy
Whereupon he was told
Wait am I still on the same page?
Okay good
Asked for a remedy where he was told
To purge his kingdom and transport this race
Into other lands
Since it was hateful to the gods
The neighbors were searched out
And gathered together
Then being abandoned in the desert
While all others lay idle and weeping
One only of the exiles
Moses
By name
Warned them not to hope for help from the gods
Or men
For they were deserted by both
But the trust to themselves
Regarding as a guide
Sent from heaven
The one whose assistance should first
Weep from their present distress
So he's basically saying
Whatever sign we get from heaven
That's going to be our god
That's what we're going to look for
A sign from heaven
To find a new god
Because the Egyptian Ammon does not like us
They agreed
And they set out on their journey in utter ignorance
But trusting to chance
Nothing caused them so much distress
As scarcity of water
And in fact
They had already fallen exhausted
Over the plain eye
Unto death when a herd of wild asses
Moved
From their pasture to a rock
That was shaded by a grove of trees
Moses followed them
And conjecturing the truth
From the grassy ground
Discovered abundant streams of water
This relieved them
And they marched six days continuously
On the seventh seized a country
Expelling the former inhabitants
And there they founded a temple
Dedicated the temple
So
The establishes influence over those people
And Moses introduced a new religious practices
Quite opposed to those of all other religions
The Jews regard as profane
All that we hold sacred
On the other hand
They permit all that we abhor
They dedicate it in a shrine
A statue of that creature
Whose guidance enabled them
To put an end to their waterings
And thirst
A statue of a donkey
Sacrificing a ram
In derision of Amon
They likewise abstain from the ox
Because the Egyptians worship it
Alright, that's the little story he gives
There's more on this too, but I'm not going to keep going
I just wanted to show that part
He gives this alternate origin story
That doesn't
It sounds like an exodus a little bit
You got Moses, you got the monitoring in the desert
But
There's a lot of different things happening here
We have a name of the Pharaoh now
We didn't get the name of the Pharaoh
In the Bible
People say Ramses
Doesn't say Ramses ever
There's no name, it just says Pharaoh
So in this text we actually get a name
So if we look at who is
Bacchorus
Here he is
Also known in Greek as Bacchorus
He's from the 24th dynasty
Alright, well how do we know that?
I mean we can just trust Wikipedia
But I want to show you how we know that
So
I'm going to go to
Alien
Let's go to Menetho
Menetho mentions this
Bacchorus, the 24th dynasty
Reigned for 44 years
And in his reign a lamb spoke
What?
Turns out that this was like
Some sort of event that happened
Where a lamb told the Egyptians
That they would be conquered by the Assyrians
And then it's okay
Has anyone else corroborated this evidence?
Alien talks about this too
This is another Roman writer
He's writing in Greek as you can see
The Egyptians assert
That they are far from convincing me
They assert that I say
In the days of the far famed Bacchorus
8 feet and 2 tails
And that it spoke
They said that the lamb had 2 heads and 4 horns
What?
So, wait a minute
Now we're looking at
Where does all this
All these prophecies of all these animals
With multiple heads and horns
Telling the people
They're going to be sacked and taken over
By the Babylonians and Assyrians
Well, here's another
Source for that
But here's the problem with this
King Bacchorus
As I've shown you
King Bacchorus
Is only in the 8th century BC
This is not
Bronze age
18th dynasty that we're talking about
This is
We're almost in the classical period
We're getting towards
The Persian period now
We're getting towards the Greek Hellenistic
Period
So, this is who this king is
Alright, let's continue
Let's see what else we got
So
I want to go to Herodotus real quick
I want to talk about the alphabet for a second
Herodotus says
That
This is the
The Phoenicians
So, okay
Herodotus
Herodotus mentions in his
Persian Wars
That the alphabet
Comes from the Phoenicians
But
He says something interesting about it
I don't even think I have the source here
I'm on the wrong page
I can look it up
The alphabet
Here it is
He says
The Phoenicians who came
With Cadmus
By the way, Cadmus
Was the king of thieves
He is a Phoenician by descent
But he's living up in thieves in Greece
And it says
At their settlement in this country
Among many others of learning
Brought into Hellas the alphabet
Which had hitherto been unknown
As I think to the Greeks
Only as the time went on
In the form of the letters changed
At this time, the Greeks that dwelt
Around them from most parts were Ionians
Who had been taught
The letters by the Phoenicians
And used them with some few changes in form
I'm not going to show you some crazy shit right here
Ready?
Thus the Ionians
Have from ancient times
Called papyrus sheets skins
But formally, lack papyrus
They used the skins of sheep goats
Ah, Lucy, where's the part that I want?
Here it is. I myself have seen
Cadmian characters
In the temple
Of Ispian
Apollo
So he's saying that the oldest alphabet
That ever existed
Is up in
The temple of Apollo in Boetia
Which is near Athens
Graven on a certain tripods
And for the most part
Like the Ionian characters
That's really strange
Now this
Because the idea of
Phoenicians
Making an alphabet
And then giving it to the Greeks
It's not as black and white as people think it is
There's more going on here
And Herodotus kind of gives a little clue on this
So let's look at this
Alright, I want to show you guys something
This is going to be cool, I promise
I'm going to share a different screen for a second
This right here
Here we go
What I'm about to show you
Is called
It is called the
Dispillow Tablet
Do you see this?
This is an
Ancient Tablet
It's a mystery right now
It was discovered like 30 years ago
In Macedonia
Which is where the Pulaskians used to live
Thrace, Macedonia
Thessaly
That's Pulaskian land
And also Turkey
Where Troy is
Modern-day Turkey
That's where the Pulaskians are from
That whole region
That's the Pulaskians
So right in the heart of the Pulaskian land
Is this
Thing that they discovered
It's like, what the fuck, what is this
Now if you look, that looks like an Eta
That looks like a dollad down there
Looks like you got
Now this one blew my mind
Because this looks like it could be either a
Digama
Which is an ancient form of a
Of a W sound
But it also looks like an Omega
Which is the, oh
It looks like, you can see
Like, all I'm saying is
Looking at these characters
You can almost imagine
An older descendant
Of
What becomes both the Greek
And Phoenician alphabets
Alright, let's continue on this
How much evidence do I have
Right, let's, what do we got here
So I'm going to share my screen
Again, and this time
I'm going to share
Well, I'll just go to the same
Let's go to this page again
Alright, share my screen
Alright, so this
Let's look into this
Tablet, what is this thing
This is what the
Alright
We'll get him back here
Just a second
I hate when that happens
You click on something and it gives you the wrong screen
I hate when that happens
Here we go, I brought it back up
Alright, so
Let's go to, alright, now this time
I shouldn't do that again
So I want to look into this now
This is what the article says
Apparently, now there's been no academic
Articles written on this tablet yet
It's a mystery
People are starting to figure out
What the hell is this thing
Because this is going to, if this really is
Alright, let's just talk about it first
Apparently, this wooden tablet
Bearing what looks like an early form
Of an alphabet, carbon dates
They did carbon dating on it
Because it's wood, so they can carbon date it
5,000 BC
Alright, that doesn't necessarily mean
The writing is 5,000 BC
Someone couldn't have scripted it
But so far, that's all we know
The carbon dating came back
It's from 5,000 BC
It's discovered in 1923
But here's the
Crazy part
This is why I wanted to bring this up
This is the crazy shit right here
It's discovered
The place they found it in
Was a Neolithic village
Which means
Wrap your head around this
You have to understand
What I'm saying here
The village that they uncovered
Very, very far underground
Is all Neolithic stuff
The pottery, the town
The building
And then this is there
How did that get there
And it's carbon dating, matches too
It fits
With the Neolithic
Except for the writing on it
What the fuck is going on
Why is there...
It looks like a Greek
Form of alphabet
In a Neolithic foundation
Put that screen up if you don't mind
I just want to show
So
Okay
The tablets discovered at a symposium
In February 1984
At the University of Thessalonica
The site's paleo environment
Bought new fishing techniques
Tools and ceramics were described
Informally in the met
That's something
So basically
All we know so far
Is they dug up this Neolithic
Place
This is work being done
By Aristotle's University at Thessalonica
Right now
Apparently I looked into it
There's articles being
Academic articles being written on this thing
That might change the
Consensus on the alphabet
I'm not kidding, look this up yourself
Please look this up, don't listen to me
But there are people saying
That the articles being
Written about this tablet
Is going to change the academic consensus
On the invention of the alphabet
Now let me continue with this
I want to show
Because the first question should be
Does the evidence
Is there any other evidence
For anything like this? Is this just
By itself?
I'm going to give you an example
Of something that's
By itself that doesn't fit
The Merneptis deli
Doesn't fit at all with any of the evidence
But it's accepted because
There's a dogma in mainstream academia
That wants
Israel to be like real
They want the fairy tale to be real
Hold that thought, put a little side note on that
Let's go, but here's the thing
It turns out that there actually is
And
Another asteroid
Sorry about that, this is getting exciting man
I'm about to lose it, look
I did a song and dance
You're on, go
Here we go
Here's what's called the
Trojan script
So it turns out there actually is
Some other
Basis of what this means
The Trojan script
Is
Look at this
Obviously it's not Greek
But you look at it
You look at the characters
You don't have to use your imagination too hard
Okay, there's some
It's not like hieroglyphics
It's very syllabic
It's very
You know, okay, so let's talk about this
What's going on here
Philologous, I think that's the same
As
Philologist probably
Attempted to transliterate the signs as Greek
Professor Hogg
Attempted to translate it the seal he claims
That the words are
Scholars are already guessing
This is some proto-Greek stuff
Going on here
By the way
People are
Trying to shut this shit down
The mainstream
Consensus is like, no way
No way, no way, no way
Some of these philologists are saying
What else can it be
And so there's a huge debate going on
About this
I'm not going to sit here and say it's Greek
But that's what people are saying
In 1994
Dr. Lewis Goder
Published the inscriptions
He identified the script as linear A
Which is we know is proto-Greek
He's saying it's at least
And I looked into it, it's at least part of this family
Of what me and Amun would call
The Pulaskian alphabet
Pre-alphabet
They're similar
Linear A
Look at linear B
Is linear B comfortable in your A?
I don't really know
I can't tell you on that
But there's a lot of stuff being written about this stuff
The picture is not there yet
There's still so much work to be done
Alright
So
There's no way
Highly unlikely
So people are not liking this at all
But here's the thing
What does it date to? That's what I want to know
The archaeological analysis
The inscriptions of the Trojan script
Date to the third millennium BCE
2200
This is over
A thousand years
Before the Phoenician alphabet
Now
It's possible
That this form of script
Could have some influence on
I'm thinking
If it's the Phoenicians
I don't really care if it's the Phoenicians
Cadmus really invented the alphabet
But whatever the story is
I don't really care
I'm looking at the evidence and I'm saying
This looks like there could be some
Precedent here
For the alphabet coming from this part of the world
Alright
The next thing I want to do now
I'm going to be careful not to kick myself off again
I promise
I want to show something real quick
We're not the Stele
I'm not going to kick it off
We're not the Stele
This is the weirdest shit ever
As we've already discussed
At length
Nobody is talking about Israel
Until the Hellenistic era
Persian period Hellenistic
It's just not really
In the sources
Barely
Is there a kingdom there?
Is there a nation?
Is it a city-state?
So this is the consensus
In the Bible scholar world
This is the oldest inscription of Israel
Everyone just accepts this
Straight up
It doesn't fit
With the data
There are no other
Inscriptions anywhere
In all the Egyptian hieroglyphs
Of mentioning the word Israel
In fact the word Israel
Doesn't even show up in Egyptian hieroglyphics
It only shows up in
The later hierotic
Demotic scripts that come
After
King Bacchorus, by the way
After 700 BC
So before that
During the age of the hieroglyphs
The word Israel is just not in there
So they find this random
And the story behind it is so funny
So I've got to read this
First of all, let me show you what it says
Apparently the translation is
The prince is our prostrate
Peace, no one raises his head among the nine bows
Desolation is for
Jehanu
Hati is pacified
Plundered is the Canaan
With every evil
Wait, we already have Canaan in here?
I thought Bible scholar says
Canaan and Israel are synonymous
That's weird, why would Israel and Canaan both be in here?
Right?
But okay, what does it actually say though?
If you actually look at the hieroglyphs
It doesn't say Israel
It says Yisiririr
I mean, why is there
Assuming this is Israel? I have no idea
No clue why
People just assume this is Israel
Why can't it be Syria?
In fact, some people have said
If you look down here
There's three citations here
There's actually more than that
If you look into it
But Wikipedia gives three citations
To scholars who say
That this is Jezreel
This isn't Israel, this is Jezreel
Israel doesn't exist yet
Some people seem to have thought this is左
But the bottom line is this
It doesn't say Israel
It says Yisiriririririririr they just assume it's Israel
When you find something like this
It's
A needle in a haystack
As far as the evidence goes
If there was a bunch of other inscriptions
that mentioned Israel. I would have no reason to doubt this, but the fact that it's just sitting by
itself and then the next the next time in the sources Israel is mentioned is all the way down in
the 800s B.C. or 8th century B.C. or something. So we're talking 500 year gap from the first time
Israel is mentioned to the second time it's mentioned ever in the sources. That's just doesn't
that should be a red flag, but I just you got to hear this story. So here's the story. This is
this is reference from this is reference from a journal article from a drawer in 1995 called
Blinders Petrie A Life in Archaeology. I should read this yourself. It's from the University of
Wisconsin Press. This is what he reports. It's almost like a transcript of what happened when
they found this. And it says Petrie called upon Wilhelm Spielberg, a German philologist in his
archaeological team to translate the inscription. By the way, these people were looking for Israel.
They weren't they went out to find Israel in Egyptian sources. They weren't like looking for
something else stumbled on this. Their goal was to find Israel in the sources. Why? Because
Copenhagen International, people who writes, I'll talk about Copenhagen International,
they're called Biblical Minimalist. It's a whole entire academic group, completely at odds with
SPL types, seminarian types. They're and they're all just saying that the whole Bible is just
fairytale. It doesn't match up with history at all. So these people started to really they were
starting to really win in these debate circles. As far as the evidence, as far as they were,
they're showing, look, there's Persian loanwords, there's Hellenistic loanwords. These texts are
written later. That's what these people have been saying this for 100 years. This is not new.
Well, I'm not bringing anything new here. Neither am I. This has been being discussed for 100 years
now. You just don't hear about it a lot. You can look into it, look into the Copenhagen International
Bible Society. You'll see a lot of shit that we're saying right now. So anyways, the point is,
they're starting to win in in these academic debates. So now people need to find out,
they need to find evidence so we can clap back at these people. So here's the story. Spiegelberg
was puzzled by one symbol towards the end, that a people or a tribe whom Merneptah
had victoriously smitten, I S I E S R R. Petrie quickly suggested that it reads Israel. It's
Israel just assumes it. Spiegelberg agreed that this translation must be correct.
Won't the reverends be pleased? Won't the reverends be pleased? I'm going to be rich.
I'm going to be rich. Remark Petrie at the dinner that evening. Petrie, who realized the importance
of this find says, this stele will be better known in the world than anything else I have found.
The news of a discovery made headlines when it reached English papers. Now, let's just be,
these are common sense now. You have incentives to go and find this shit. And look how they just
find something close enough. It's in the general location. Ignore that canons already on that
list. Just don't tell anybody about that part. But it's Israel. It's Yerebeer. It's Yerebeer.
It's Israel. Yes, it must be. Won't the reverends be pleased? Probably got rich off that. Rich.
For the rest of the, that was the greatest discovery that person will ever make. They had
every incentive. So I'm just saying, look, maybe it is Israel. I'm keeping an open mind here,
but I'm just saying, why is it accepted? So people who, there's scholars right now,
I'm not going to call out names anymore. I'm not going to do that. We did that a few times,
but you guys know who I'm talking about, who are winning awards from the SPL, winning the greatest,
if you're the greatest scholar of the year award, people who are just literally going on TikTok,
telling people that this is real and the scholarly consensus is 100% agrees that this is real,
which is not true. There is a bunch of debate about the Merneptis Deli. It's not accepted
by every scholar. In fact, I think the evidence shows that this was kind of like bullshit. All
right. So I want to talk about one more thing, and then I'm done. That's, that's what I wanted.
I wanted to talk about that alphabet. But the next thing I want to discuss real quick is,
this is, this is a big one. So let me, I'm going to share my screen one more time. I promise I won't
get kicked off this time. So that was really bad. All right. This is going to be crazy. So
you always hear this, the Hellenistic period, right? What's the Hellenistic period? The Hellenistic
period is from the time Alexander the Great conquered the East. So 333, so 332 or whatever,
till the time of Rome. All right. So you almost, you get this dogma in academics and Bible scholar
world, where it's impossible that any Greek influence could happen on anything before the
Hellenistic period. The Greeks were nobodies before the Hellenistic period. That is bullshit.
And the evidence proves this. So I got a couple sources, and I'm almost done, I promise. But
this will be cool. You'll like this. So I'm going back to my screen again. And see this coin right
here. That's yellow. As you can see, Yod, Aleph, Vav. It's not four letters, it's three letters.
It's from the fourth century BC. And guess what? It's from the Persian period.
But it's obvious. And by the way, every scholar who's identified this coin
said it's influenced by Hellenistic imagery of Zeus holding the eagle. That is an image of Zeus.
There is no other, you can't say that's Ahura Mazda. You can't say that's
some Indian, no, look this up for yourself. Don't listen to me. That is Zeus in the being called
Yahweh. That means Hellenism was in Hellenism, not in the sense of the age. Hellenism in the sense of
Greek like was already influencing the East way before Alexander the Great. Well, I wouldn't say
way before, but a century before at least. This coin proves this. And by the way, there's more.
Look, here's another one. That's Yahweh. Let's Zeus, but it says Yahweh on it. It's a Persian period
coin. Here's another one. That's clearly Zeus with his eagle. Totally Jupiter Zeus, whatever you
want to call them. That's, this is a Persian period coin. And it says Yahweh on it. Okay.
Now, there's actually, there's, what's, so what's going on here? How are the Greeks influencing
the East if they're not ruling Babylon? That's, that's what a Bible scholar would say and to
clap back at me. And I'll just say, well, if you don't know the sources then, because Herodotus
tells us all about what's going, by the way, Diodorus of Sicily mentions that Yahweh is the
God of Moses. He spells it Y-I-A-O. And he says that this is like some synchronistic,
synchronistic God of the like, basically it's like all these gods rolled into one.
And Macrobius mentions this too. So people know about Yahweh. In fact, Chaldean oracles say it's
the name of Bacchus. And I've showed you guys that before. That's a whole, I didn't bring that with
me, but I want to show something about Herodotus and then Alexander the Great and then I'm done.
Herodotus actually discusses something in this one right here. So Herodotus says
where is it? Here we go. This is cool. Now Herodotus is away before Alexander the Great.
He says that when the Persians came to Cyrene, the country of Cyrene, which is the highest part
of Libya, which the nomads inhabit, has the marvelous boon of three harvest seasons. He
talks about them for a little bit. So who are the Cyrenes, right? I'm just going to share another
screen real quick. I have to show you guys this. Cyrene. All right. So Barca. Barca is this ancient
city, right? And it's a Greek city. It's like you look at the history. Barco appears to be a
Libyan tribe. By the way, this is where Medea was from too. The Greek settlers of Cyrene colonized it.
It shows that the Greeks were there all the way back in the 7th century BC. Herodotus places
the foundation of the city or whatever. So there's all this stuff about this Hellenistic city. Look
it. There's Amon right there. So you can see there's an obvious Hellenistic Greek influence.
That's from 475 BC during the Occamended period. Persian period, guys. Why is there Greek gods
on Persian period stuff? Because the Greeks are influencing shit way before Alexander the Great.
These are people who are very influential. Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Thales. These are brilliant
minds. So the reason why I brought this up is because I have one more thing I want to show you.
During the Persian period, according to Herodotus,
he says, Herodotus says that the Persians, I'll just tell you it's in here. He says it's in book
four or a book, yeah, book four. He says the Persians went to this Greek city,
took all the Greeks out of there and Ionians too. So he took Ionians. Persians are conquering Ionia
and Egypt. They tried to conquer Greece and they lost. Everyone knows this famous battle between
the Persians and the Greeks. There's a few battles, but they did conquer the Egyptians and they conquered
the Ionians. All these people who are Hellen already influenced by the Greeks.
He says that they sent them all to Greco-Bactria. Now, where's that? This is my last thing I want
to show you guys. This is just like tying it all together. So Bactria, if we look at the
Achaemenid period, right? See all the way over here, all the way on the top left, can you see my
mouse? I don't know if you can see my mouse, but all the way up here where it says Sakaas,
Sogdenia, Bactria. So it turns out, if you fact check me on this, these were Greek cities
before Alexander the Great even got there because Cyrus relocated Greeks from Ionia and Cyrene
and set them up in these cities all the way in modern day Afghanistan. So before Alexander the
Great got to Bactria, there was already Greek cities there and that's why they call him a
liberator. A lot of people will say, oh, they only call him a liberator because the victor is
writing the history. Now, that could be true in some cases, but in this case, it's not. In this
case, Alexander the Great was seen as a liberator. When he came to Bactria and came to these cities,
they were like, finally, the Greeks are here. Great. And he built Alexandria the farthest,
which is all the way in modern day Afghanistan. It actually was the last Hellenistic city in the
world, last Greek kingdom to exist in the world. So when Rome conquered Greece, when the Seleucids
fell and the Ptolemies fell to Rome, there was a kingdom all the way in Afghanistan. It was still
Greek and it lasted all the way to like 200 AD and no one ever talks about it. All right.
Last thing I want to show you guys is a cool passage from Alexander the Great and
from Arian about Alexander the Great. This is so cool. And it just kind of highlights
how far this Bacchic Empire reached. We talked about Medea. And by the way, Herodotus, when he
talks about the start of the Trojan War, this is in Book 1, Chapter 1 of Herodotus. He says
that the reason why the Trojan War happened is because Yo was kidnapped. And then in retaliation
of Yo being kidnapped, the Greeks captured Medea, brought her to Athens. And then the Trojans came
in and retaliated to the Greeks and captured Helen. So there's three princesses being captured.
And that's why this war started. And it's almost, it's very strange that these three
faces, Medea, Helen of Troy, and Yo, very influential, almost deified goddesses in many
ways with their way they're written about in these texts. And they're all living in the same time
period according to Herodotus. And they're the reason why this war has happened. They're the
reason why we have civilization. And so when Alexander finally goes west, or I mean east,
this is what Arian says about this. This is a cool text. Where is it? Maybe I didn't bring that one.
All right, whatever. So yeah, Alexander, I'll just tell you the story. It's an Arian. Alexander the
Great travels all the way to Bactria. And he says that they were in these mountains that they
thought was Nisa, the city of Nisa of Dionysus. And they found wild ivy growing on the mountains.
So Alexander, in his compatriots, took the ivy off, donned him as Rhys, and started having a
Bacchic, they went into a Bacchic frenzy immediately. That's what Arian says. Cool story, by the way.
And I'm just going to leave you with this last thing that I want to show you guys.
So there's the earliest sources about, I'm always talking about the earliest mentions of any of these
texts, or anyone mentioning Moses, anyone mentioning Abraham. When you look at when these texts start
showing up, or when these people start getting mentioned in the sources, the first time it's
mentioned is Hecateus of Abdera. And then you get Menatho, then you get Alexander Polly, his
store, you start getting, and it's all in the Hellenistic period. And they're all Greek writers
writing about Moses, that the stories don't match up with the Bible. They're all happening later
times. Abraham is like, the stories are different. The Jews living in Elephantine, who left Israel
around in the 500s, go down in Egypt, and they have thousands of papyri that they
discovered in these cities. And thousands of Aramaic papyries and inscriptions in this
Egyptian city. And these are Jews. These are Jewish. They're writing in Aramaic, but they're Jews.
They never mentioned Abraham. They never mentioned Moses. They never mentioned David.
They never mentioned Noah. They don't mention anybody in the Bible. And we're talking
400s, 480 BCE. That's not an argument from silence. That's an argument of no evidence.
That's not an argument from silence. That's an argument of no evidence.
All right. And that's the last thing I want to show you guys. I keep saying that, but this is
really it. This character, Museus of Athens. No one ever talks about this, but Museus of Athens was,
supposedly, he was the son of Orpheus. And he composed these texts called the Crespoi, the
Oracles. And they're like Bible stories, basically. They're prophetic wisdom.
They're songs like the Psalms. Psalmoi means songs. The word Psalmoi means songs written
for a harpist. That's what the word Psalmoi means in Greek. It's a Greek. Psalms are Greek.
It's a very Orphic concept. In fact, they're in the Septuagint. I have it over here somewhere.
My handy-dandy Septuagint. Check this out. There's a Psalm. It's called Psalm 151,
but it's not, it's before the Christian Bibles started numbering stuff. So it's actually just at
the end of, it's at the end of Psalms. So it's actually technically part of Psalm 150. And if
you read it, it's like, it's about, it's about King David playing his lyre and calming all the animals
and trees. It sounds like Orpheus. It's an Orphic Psalm. And so this character, let's just put up
the screen one more time real quick. And this is the last one. This character, Moseius of Athens,
was the son of Orpheus, who was considered to be, look at this. This is how they describe him.
He is a polymath, a philosopher, historian, a prophet, a seer, a priest, a poet, and a musician.
Who does that sound like? Sounds like Moses, man. It's a lawgiver, all that stuff.
Yeah. One of the stories about him, he came to the, he went to the Phrygians and gave them laws.
So he's a lawgiver too. And he's mentioned about, he's mentioned all these sources, right? And by the
way, if you look at the early Jewish writers, philosophers, and, and this is mentioned in
Eusebius, Preparatio Evangelica. Artipanus of Alexandria, Alexander Polyhistor, Numenius of
Epimea, and it doesn't say it here, but Hecateus of Abdera too, all say that this is Moses.
So this Greek Athenian character is, they're saying is the real Moses, that Moses is sort of
based off this guy. They're sort of taking the story of Mousses of Athens and sort of rewriting
a story of a lawgiver from, from Egypt. Instead of going from Athens to Phrygia, he's going from
Egypt to Judea. But the stories are, they line up like perfectly. So anyways, that's my, that's
my, I brought, I brought some texts on a little scatterbrained today, but I just wanted to try to
compliment what he's saying about the linguistic side and give some of the historical side.
That was gorgeous. Absolutely gorgeous. Oh my God. How many degrees have you gotten in the last
couple of years? My goodness, man. I don't care about. I care about, I care about the text. I care
about like finding stuff out. I don't like give a shit about a degree. I don't care about an award
from the SPL. I don't care a shit about none of that. Yeah. You know, you're doing what they're
not doing. So isn't that funny? You are really the ideal scholar and you're not sucked into the
BS that is academia and the selling of books and peddling of position and authority and
who, who. So nice job. Beautiful job. My God. Somebody asked me, somebody asked me recently,
if I think there's a conspiracy for academics to like, like, you know, whatever. And I go, no,
it's not that. It's an environment of, of strong dogmas. And, and you, it's, there's no conspiracy.
There's no, it's not like one scholar secretly like telling them, oh, I think they're all right.
And we need to hide the truth. It's not, none of that's going on. What I think is going on is
New Testament scholarship is so dominated by people who want this stuff to be true that it's sort of
when, when scholars get, when new students come up in these seminars, they're being pushed in a
direction where they can't even challenge the status quo because they won't have a job. Their books
won't get sold. They won't be part of the crew. They'll be outcasted and they don't want that.
So they sort of subconsciously just, just go along with whatever is being taught to them. And
they're not really, they're not really, they're not really being, being given any
reason to go outside, to go outside and discover. They're, they're, it's like they're being
conditioned to just be part of the system that's already there and just serve the system rather
than go out and discover something that no one's discovered yet. And, and I'm not saying people
don't do that, but I'm saying there's so much dogma and trying to keep all this historical
and try to keep, oh, the, uh, Israel's so ancient and they're way, way older than the Greeks and
they, it's all, yeah. And that, that whole dogma is just so strong that it can't be questioned.
That's what I think is going on. Yeah, it's always a matter of whether or not you can crack that
ceiling of what, um, where the control mechanism is, right, to shut you down because whoever brings
you that history is that stuff floating around the air around us. Um, I thought that was, uh,
brilliantly done. I have a question. I have a question for you. Um, you think that old, um,
that fifth, you know, 5000 BC, you think that that's crazy, isn't it? Yeah. Yeah. Do you think
that's probably Pulaski? Um, yeah. Is that, is that, is that where you would go with that? I mean,
that's where I want to go, but God, how can we break that down and figure out if it is? Because
it sounds like, how did that thing end up in a Neolithic village surrounded by Neolithic pottery
with a, on a piece of wood that's carbon dated to that same Neolithic period? How the hell did
that get there? And I'll, I'll admit that's an anomaly. It doesn't make any sense. But like,
then you look, but then, okay, that's because we're jumping from 5000 BC to 2000 BC. When you
start seeing similar, which is what they call the Trojan script. When you start seeing similar
scripts, linear A comes, comes from, uh, Crete. So the whole Mediterranean seems to have similar
style of writing. Whereas in Egypt, it's hieroglyphics and, and, and soon, and Middle East, that's
cuneiform. But in the Mediterranean world, you see this, what looks like proto-alphabetic scripts,
which is what the whole point I was trying to make was, it looks like the alphabet isn't coming
from cuneiform or hieroglyphics. It's coming from over here. And the evidence, people are ignoring
the Trojan script. They're just writing it off. No, no, no, that's not real. But it's like, what is
it then? It's something, it's something. It's sitting there. Let's figure out what it is. Why
does nobody care? And, and you know, when you brought up, you were like, well, it doesn't really
look like it, but maybe I'm telling you, I'm telling you, when I went into Emmett Bennett who
cracks linear B, the first time I looked at a linear B tablet, I, it is nowhere near, um, any of
the Greek that I had been taught. Um, so yeah, the fact that there's something there is actually
what's most important. It'll take the egghead some time to crack that one. But I sure hope it's
Pulaski and, you know, it's been 30 years since they discovered it in Macedonia. And no, no peer
reviewed articles have been published, zero. So it's just sitting there. No one's done any work on it.
It's like, do they, do people, do people not, is there no incentive for anybody to talk about this?
And I'm not saying there's a conspiracy, like I said, I'm not saying the conspiracy. I'm saying
there's nobody care. Is that what's going on? Nobody cares. They just want this to be,
oh, the Phoenicians created the alphabet from, from Egyptian and they gave it to the Greeks.
So what the, what the fuck is this? What are these inscriptions then? Why are they, why does it look
so similar to Greek? Yeah, I think it's, I think it's laziness too. You got to factor that in. If
there's not money in it, and let's be honest, cracking something like this, you know, it's
probably not going to yield you a big, you know, nobody's going to make you rich over it and give
you sponsors, right? Unless you can successfully, if you can successfully slam dunk 100% proof
and change the academic consensus and say, look, we think the alphabet might have came from somewhere
else. And then if you can do that, that, that'll make you famous forever. But don't promise you're
up against a brick wall right now. That doesn't work. If you, if the Wikipedia article shows you,
every person who tried to sit publish, say it's Greek, got shut down. I mean, no way it's not
Greek, can't be Greek. We know the Phoenicians made the alphabet shut up, sit down. No, that's,
that's really what's been happening. So the question is, if it's not Greek, then what is it?
Yeah. Yeah. The, that's exactly what they were saying about linear B, because they did not know
it was Greek to start with. So yeah, it's a, it's a great candidate. With everything the Greeks are
saying about the Pulaskians. And you know now, Neil, because you've been reading the sources,
it only makes sense that the language is going directly back to that ancestor. So,
yeah, yeah, I think we're ready. Just to clarify, when I say Greek, obviously what I mean is
proto Greek, Pulaskian, Mycenaean, I'm talking, I'm not talking about like they didn't, maybe
they didn't call themselves Greeks. I'm saying that this area and this, and similar Indo-European
language structure, that's what I mean by that. So what I say, you mentioned Medea too. If you
don't mind, I want to ask you your opinion, because they also said that Medea was Helen,
and that she was the one who was projecting her image into Achilles' mind, because you know,
Medea and Achilles end up in, in Elysium, as the bride pair in Elysium. And when Achilles
was in his all-girls school, Deidemia was there, and she's the only priestess who had intercourse
with him, as he was disguised. And our ancient sources actually say Deidemia is another way to
say Medea. Wow. So yeah. I'll check this out. People don't know this. There's a text written
by Homer. It's lost. But Statius, a Latin Roman, in the Roman period, he wrote, I don't know if he
translated Homer, or if he rewrote the story in Latin. The point is, we have the story, we know
what it's about, it's preserved in Latin. But the Greek Homeric text, it's a prequel
to the Iliad. The Iliad wasn't just two books, Iliad and Odyssey. It was, I think, eight. I think
they said it's called an octetuch. And I think it's, it's called the Achillid, which is the story
of Achilles that you just mentioned. And that story is crazy. Achilles grew up trans. I'm not,
I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, look, people can understand, you're, come on, Jude, you're applying
modern technology stuff and read the text. He grew up as a girl amongst the Amazonians,
and the Amazonian tribe of Scythia. He wore all girls' clothing. He was disguised as a girl his
entire life, because Zeus was going to kill him if he found him. But he did, so about, like,
that's the story. I'm just telling, that's the story. By the way, okay, back to Medea. That's
what you asked me for. I think Homer is giving an esoteric retelling of the Trojan War story,
because this is the, he's, Yo is captured, Medea is captured, and Helen is captured. He's, he's,
it almost, it's almost like the hackety three-headed goddess, because by the way, who is Yo? Now,
we've already connected, you just connected Medea and Helen. That was great. But what, why is Yo
there? Well, Yo, you know who Yo is? Yo is the Christ. Yo is the character in Prometheus bound,
who gets stung by the gadfly, and the word Aeschylus uses is Christo, Christe, Christi,
Christed. So Medea, Helen, Yo is like a triple goddess Christ figure. Pre, this is the Christ.
We've been saying, you and I have been talking about this for years now. You've been, you much
longer. But there is a ancient Christ, and she was a goddess. And I, that's what I think is going on
with Herodotus. I think he's giving a, a retelling of the Iliad. It's a book one, chapter one of
Herodotus, read it for yourself, where he says, here's what happens before the Iliad, before the
events of Homer's Iliad, before Troy got captured. And he's, it's this random story about Yo, Medea,
and Helen all being captured at the same time. It's very strange. I think there's,
I think there's definitely something going on there.
Gorgeous, gorgeous. Yeah, no. And there's, there's a, sometimes the language blocks us off from what
they're actually kind of communicating, because everybody knows like that Helen was able to
project her image. So the Greeks will write about her actually being in Egypt. She never went to Troy.
Right. She actually went to Egypt and projected her image there. So what do they mean when they
say this, right? What is, what is going on in the Greek mind? And when you actually read that, well,
see Achilles had dreams. And in these dreams, he was visited by the Medwa, right? All of a sudden,
you're into a cultural practice. You're into a cult practice. And you're into this marriage,
this heroes gamos, right? And these terms are familiar to them. So when they're going through
these myths, when you're talking about Achilles, that's who you've got in the center of your image.
He's essentially the guy who goes through the initiation, right? And realize Medea is actually
older, right? She's projected into this generation. So it's, you know, but of course, she always looks
young, always looks young. It's an incredible cult kind of operation that you wouldn't think.
You know, people are like, what does this have to do? Remember, Isaiah is a profetis, right?
Guess what Medea is? She's not just a prophet. She's the arch prophet. She's the one who brings
the oracles, right? She's sitting and thrown on the island of Thera. Yeah, what it looks like
is happening is when you look at the prophets, by the way, I mentioned the Copenhagen Society.
Russell Gamerkin has written a book. It's peer reviewed. He's got two of them, right? First,
he came out with this, Plato's Tamaeus biblical creation accounts. And he lays it out that the
presecratics invented monism. And obviously, there's some Persian influence there too, obviously,
not denying that Zoroastrian, he talks about that too. And then it gets, that's why he says he dates
the Helen, he dates the Old Testament texts, the Hellenistic period, just like we're both doing.
And then people shot back at him and said, well, that's the case, you would expect the law codes,
the law codes in Deuteronomy are all ancient Babylonian law codes. Well, then he came out with
this book, also peer reviewed, Plato and the creation of the Hebrew Bible. He shows that
75% of the law codes, I think 75 or 80% of the law codes, the majority of the law codes in Deuteronomy
and Leviticus and Numbers line up with Athenian law codes. And only about 20% of them are from
Babylonian or whatever, Egyptian. So most of them are actually do, so he shot back and saying,
no, you're actually wrong. It's Greek, still Greek. So now nobody, you know what they do?
Instead of having an academic discussion and debating, write an article, write a fiery article,
talk shit back. Let's do this. This is what, nobody, they just ignore him. In fact, I went
and Dan McClelland, this is, I went to one Dan McClelland live one time, and he was answering
questions. It wasn't super chats. Anyone that asked a question, one by one, he was reading them
and answering them. He got to my question. What are your thoughts on Copenhagen and the
biblical minimalism? He didn't even read it. He skipped right over me. What's the next question?
They don't even want to engage with this shit, dude. Why?
Yeah, exactly. That's what the appropriation is for, right? It gives you legitimacy. If you
don't have legitimacy, your whole stack of cards falls down. So yeah, yeah, love it. Love it.
That's a perfect way, Neil, to kind of bring everything full circle.
What we've got is a group of languages, and we've got this survival,
this story that's playing out, this narrative. It's very biological. And that thing, the best
thing that you can do to follow that track is to watch how the Greek language so
took over and influenced the world. You got to remember of our Anglo-Saxon, you know, 30% to
a half of it somewhere. It's coming from the Greek. We're only able to get these concepts because of
that powerful, powerful language. But as you mentioned, because of the limitations on Germanic
languages and English, Anglo-Saxon English being one of those Germanic languages, we can only,
like, we can borrow words from Greek, but we can't express things. Like, you try to translate a
Greek text, you're dumbing it down. You're watering it down. It's completely bottlenecked.
It becomes like a less, becomes like a very rigid version. You're right. The Greek language is
special. It's very special. It's very, it's very advanced. It's very, and that's why that's why
that's, I think it's another reason to, to suggest that the alphabet could come from such a place
that's so advanced in writing. I suspect that power was coming through the Pulaskian side.
That's what, that's what I think. I think ancient Greek got its ump from that old Pulaskian ancestor
because they're always associating, like, specific religious rites with the Pulaskians.
So, you know, any of the terms that come through, like that, we talked tonight about the Laconian,
right, and the source of that word being, we didn't say it, but it was the howling,
right, that wolf's howling and the lukon root of that word. All of that is in the text, but it's
getting there from that old Pulaskian side. I'm starting to think that it was the Pulaskians who
really had their shit together and had a language that was, you know, it was off the charts,
expressively and mechanically off the charts. Not just in what it could express conceptually,
but in its flexibility and its native ability to build words and to use words together. They're
always using the same root paired next to each other. They're always making contrast in, like,
inherent comparisons and contrasting. It's amazing, amazing. You can even tell in the Greek
sentence, you can even tell whether or not an action is being performed for the benefit of the
subject or not, right? It's like, how did they figure this out? How did they, I hope it was
those Pulaskian, those were horse tribes too. That's why they ended up, like you said, in Thessaly,
anywhere on Lemnos as well. They also ended up on Lemnos and that stuff on Lemnos looks like it's,
you know, people are trying to figure out that one too. They're like, which language is this?
Yeah, Cypriot syllables. It's called Cypriot syllables or whatever. And you have Lydian alphabet.
It looks like, it looks like, it looks like some people say it looks Phoenician, but it looks very
Greek too. Probably some sort of ancestor of what we're talking about, some sort of,
some sort of Pulaskian thing that started off. And then you have, like, the Lydian,
Hittite languages. They're all Indo-European. They line up more with Greek than they do with
anything Semitic. And somewhat, they use Kanaeiform for a while. But then during the Persian period,
they start using the alphabet. So you start getting, you start getting these Indo-European
languages, very similar. They have, like, they worship Artemis. Artemis is in their land, like,
there's a so much Greek overlap with the Hittite languages, like the Lydian languages,
the Phrygians, the Cappadocians. The Ionians were just so brilliant. They were just the scientists
of the ancient world. They started civilization. Those are the, that's where everything,
all the credit is due to the Ionians. Totally. Hippocrates. You were mentioning famous
people in antiquity. Hippocrates, baby. He writes in a beautiful Ionian. It's gorgeous. And it's
kind of, you were, you were talking about the oath. You were reading the oath the other day,
looking at that oath. Isn't that delicious? The translation that, that the current translation
is so Christianized, it's so bad. They have, like, holy in there and there's no holy in there.
They're just, like, throwing words that don't exist or that aren't in the trans, the Greek.
Power of duty. It's our duty to protect that.
They, they, they took the, so the translation that you look at, look up the Hippocratic oath
and you read it on Wikipedia, you're going to read a Christianized version of it. It's not the
same. The Greek's a lot different. And by the way, the Christianized version says, I will never
give somebody an abortion. If you read, it's not in there. It says, it says, I will not give anybody
aphrodisiacs against their will. It says the exact opposite. Why is it, how did that happen?
It talks about the Thanacemon, the death inducer too. It's the context of the pharmacology that
you have to get in to your mind. Yeah, everybody makes a big deal about that. I wanted to ask you,
while I've got you prisoner, tell me the Herculaneum Library. So 800 scrolls,
probably with a lot that we're not, we're not, we don't even know who the authors are, right?
So tell me this, what is your understanding of, or do you think people are getting it,
how important this thing is, how important this library is? From what I've seen,
people talk about it like other, other YouTubers who are into this stuff are also on their,
on the edge of their seat. We can't wait to see what's going to happen. They translated a text
that it was like a philosophical doctrine about, about having good, being in good,
how to be in good, cheerful spirits or something along those lines. And you can just tell it's
just some Greek shit. Like that's all they write about. It's all about aesthetics and
some pre-secratic talking about, like the Epicureans are like, it's all about being cheerful.
The Stoics, that's all good chill. That's the Greek attitude, man. I love the Stoics.
I love the cynics. The cynics, I love the cynics. They don't give a shit. Cynics, throw out your
wealth. There's a picture of crates. I call Ammo and crates that no one knows of this.
One more time. I'm going to show you one more thing. I got it. So crates from, I think he's
from Athens. I don't know where he's from. Found it. Okay, crates of Athens. Check this out, right?
I call Ammo and crates all the time when I talk to him because he reminds me of this dude. Ready?
All right, you got it. So crates of Athens was one of the, he was a student of Diogenes,
the cynic, and there's that famous painting of him. Oh, where is it? They don't have it on here.
Um, crates painting of Athens. I got to show him this. This is you all day. Here it is.
All right, hold on. I got to share my other screen now. Ready for this? This is Ammo all day,
dumping out his wealth. He doesn't care. See, he's dumping out all the diamonds
because the cynics had this attitude of reject riches, live in nature, live in a, live in,
go to the inner city and live in a barrel. And you'll see, you'll be happy one day if you could
figure out how to live like that. That was a cynic attitude, man. And Stoicism actually comes out
of cynicism. Um, the first Stoic Xeno was a student of crates. So it goes, it goes Diogenes,
who's around for Socrates, Diogenes, then crates, and then Xeno, the first Stoic.
So Stoicism comes out of cynicism. You need to be a cynic before you could be a Stoic.
Isn't that crazy? I like that the cynics are called cynics because they were considered dogs.
Yeah, dog-like. That's what I have in my Twitter account. Coon is called as dog-like.
Live, be happy in life. Dogs are always happy, right? All they want is their food and be able
to go outside and piss. That's it. If you could live like a dog, life is good. That's the standard
attitude. That's Diogenes, baby. He just did what he wanted, you know what I mean? He was the only
dog that didn't leave town when the bad guys came because he didn't care. He was the anti,
he was the Satan of Plato because there's stories about him and Plato live together.
They hate each other and there's stories about Diogenes confronting Plato and saying,
dude, I heard you had to kiss the ass of because the tyrant Dionysus of Sicily,
the richest, he was the richest king, probably the world at that time, and Plato would go visit
this guy so he can get like favors and stuff. And Diogenes is like, you have to go kiss the
ass of this tyrant. That sucks. And Plato's like, well, you have to wash your vegetables in a river.
He's like, at least I don't have to kiss an ass to a tyrant. Like it was just like,
dude, Diogenes is awesome, man. I love it. I love reading about Diogenes.
I love that, man. I love that. That's beautiful. Okay, okay. I'm going to declare a closing to
tonight's most outstanding episode, but I want to first of all, thank Gnostic for coming and say,
I am truly, truly overawed by the work. And now I'm going to have to go back and think
about some of the Pulaski and stuff again, kind of bring that up to the fore. So I'm well done,
sir. I hereby give you your master's degree, and now we will proceed to the PhD.
That first part with the linguistics blew my mind. That was the first time I ever heard anything like,
you brought some some some arguments there. Yeah, and hopefully people will see and they'll,
you know, they'll copy and they'll be like, Oh, wait a minute, can you actually do this?
Can you read the Greek and find out that the Hebrew is totally different? Yes, you can.
Um, so, you know, where are the lazy classes this out there? Get off your back sides and
start working on the Bible, right? It needs it. You got to start doing it, man. Don't let them
take it from you. There's still ancient texts. Yeah, love it. I want to say I'm going to meet.
I'm going to give you the last word, Neil, but I want to say I'm going to meet with the discordians,
and we will find out the news from Omnia. Um, thank you for everybody for coming tonight.
I want to, I'm, I'm going to throw it to you so don't jump off right away, but
Hail Satan on my end, Neil. It's your last word tonight. What do you think, man?
Matt, I just got to say we have, okay, I got something deeper. I want to say about this.
So I heard that there's classics departments being shut down Bible or, you know,
ancient studies being shut down. And my first reaction that was like, that can't be good.
But then I thought about it. Maybe it might be good because now we live in a time period where
we have access to libraries online, Loeb International, for example, library, every Greek
text, every Latin text right there at your fingertips. You can go on wiz on and learn
language from an expert. You can learn Greek, you can learn Latin, you can learn Hebrew,
you can learn whatever you want. Coptic. You have no excuse on that now. And 50 years ago,
you had to go to a college and you had to find somebody who can teach you in your city. You were,
if you didn't find, if someone in your city didn't teach Greek, you're not learning Greek,
period. So now that's gone. Now you have, you can learn Greek, you have Loeb,
you have Topos text. So you can find any reference to anyone mentioned in any source
at your fingertips. You have chat GPT for help you translate. I've used to help me translate.
It's pretty damn good. You have Topos geography, where you can look up archaeological sites and
find out where people where, where ancient sites are and look with the dig say and all that stuff.
You have, we call it Alice, Perseus Tufts. We call it Alice from that song. Perseus Tufts,
which we call Alice, that's your, that's your, that's your, that's your dagger. So basically,
Loeb is your, is your helmet. Perseus Tufts is your dagger. The Greek from wiz on is your sword.
Your, your armor is the, is Loeb, the text. We have every tool at your fingertips to do this
stuff yourself. But that also means test your theories out there. If you think something,
if you find something, you think I found something that no one, I found some sort of discovery,
I have a new theory, put it out there and let people respond to it, test it out. By the way,
this is what I've been doing for the last three years. Three years ago, if you watched my videos
from three years ago, I was saying some crazy shit that I don't think today. Why, why did I change
my mind? Cause I was able to throw them, I didn't just hold onto my theories and keep them to myself.
I threw them out there on the internet and they got tested in the fire. And if I was wrong, I was
wrong. And then I changed that. I would adjust my theories and my, my work and keep going. And
that's what I think everyone should be doing. So we're in a time period now where you don't
really need to pay $40,000 to go to university. You could just do it yourself. So that's my,
that's my health safety point.
And kudos to you. And that's why you're a real scholar. That's why you're a real scholar. Cause
look, you're doing this for the motivation, for the love of the texts. You know what I mean?
Compare that to somebody at who, how Harvard, who's got the position and all the talks to go to
and who, how it's all who, how, right? He's not there anymore for the, I can tell you, I work
with these people that they're not there anymore for the beauty of it. So in, in being Ronan and
in educating yourself as a Ronan on the outside, Neil, um, people, look at the virtue of Gnostic
and form it. Look at it. Yeah. It's nice. Admire the virtue. I admire your virtue, Neil.
It's may it have long life. Indeed. Indeed. Thank you for coming, everybody, and everybody at
Discordia, please come and meet me right now. Um, and Neil, it's a true honor. Hail Satan.
I'll see him.
With the kiss of poison. She's coming to see you. Boom back.
