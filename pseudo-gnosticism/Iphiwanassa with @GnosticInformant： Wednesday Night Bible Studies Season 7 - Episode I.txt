custom-made
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave on the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a star coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed all the way
Why did you ever change your name all the way?
Why did you ever change your name?
Welcome back to the very decent last season of Satanic Initiation
And tonight we come to Bible studies
And oh my goodness, do I have a couple of wampers for you tonight?
It's going to be delicious
And I just want everybody to remember that we are covering everything with crosses
Covering everything with crosses is our chorus
Love it, love it
It's a decency thing
We'll have Gnostic Informant later
In order to provide comment
To answer some interesting questions
Difficult questions
Questions that you wouldn't answer
If you had anybody looking over your shoulder
Fortunately, we don't
So we can go to whatever texts we want
And on Lady Babylon Bible Studies tonight
We're going to go in deep
Welcome
Tonight on Lady Babylon
You're going to be watching some of the most profoundly powerful and impactful images
You're going to receive these into your mind
You're going to become one with that idea
And that may cause you to be uncomfortable
It's okay
It's not me
While you're sitting there, I had the machine dialed for the 15th
We're going to take a quick jump out tonight in the 15th
And the way we're going to get there
Is we're going to parachute right out of our space-time vessel
But it's okay because Beccadilly is going to catch us
Beccadilly is going to catch us
I'll say a few words about him
After he shows up
But tonight I want to just let him sing for you
Everybody
This is Beccadilly
Becadilly
Becadilly
Fantastic
Becadilly puts everything in perspective, doesn't it?
Now, Becadilly got in a lot of trouble writing it now
The dead Medici's liked it
And it was at the front of the Renaissance
But in his work on the hermaphrodite
There were certain things that the prevailing society around
Didn't want them to be talking about or thinking about or looking at
And one of them was the hermaphrodite
What Becadilly did was he took that sword edge and plunged it
Right into the heart of the church
And he got the response that, you know, he should have predicted he would get
He had to come to a place to recant
You too shall recant your understanding of history
Love it
I've brought you some great stuff tonight
And I'm very happy to be able to bring things to an end
I'm very happy, I'm very excited to be here
I'm just, oh, you know how it is when you're in that place
And you think, wow, when they said apocalypse, this is what it is
Turn up, did someone turn up?
Did somebody turn up that global thermostat?
Somebody turned up, Chewie, did somebody turn up that global thermostat?
Keeps going up, fantastic
Let's bring you right in tonight, okay?
Now that we purify the place, Becadilly
I just want to take you in, show you some of the real
Give me that first, Chewie, hit it, beautiful
Yeah, this is who I want you to consider tonight
Ifi wanasa
Ifi wanasa
Yeah, this is an old, old, old name
You see the ifi on the front and the anasa following
That anasa or wanasa is an old Mycenaean term
It's an old Mycenaean term, can you see this people?
This is old, the stuff that you think of is history
Before it ride, this is before all the stuff
And what does this mean, take it down
This is for every woman in the audience tonight
This is for every woman
It means the queen's force
Queen's force, what is that?
I don't even know what that is scientifically
Queen's force, is it a perfume?
Can I spray some of that?
See if it smells good, it's making me tingle
Queen's force, that's who we're looking at
Ifi wanasa
Let's hit the next one
Oh, I just want to take you to 1331, now people
With all the clues and everything
You know what you have to do, get your decoders out
1331 it is
Take us to the next star chart
There we go, I want you to read this tonight
Here we go, are you ready?
Who are we talking about, a pice?
We're talking about a kid
We're talking about a kid wanasa
Right, a thousand years before Isaac
Was getting his sacrifice
Ifigenaya was the sacrifice
In the third century
When people began to make up
What you call the Old Testament
Those people, they borrowed
Sorry, they borrowed
From older established mystery cults
That followed not Moses
But the Muses
And so they borrowed
Judaism is a creation
The religion, right?
The religion is practiced
By ultra-orthodox and orthodox
That practice is based in
A much older mystery practice
Where the girl is sacrificed
To the goddess
Do you know what we do in this type of world?
This is the type of world of Lupercalia
This is the type of the world of Lupercalia
You know what we do?
Thank goodness, Evander showed us
It was his mother who gave us the alphabet
What's her name?
What's her name?
We're in Italy now, people
Did you feel that bump?
We just got to Italy
What's her name?
Her name is Carmenta
Wait, who?
Carmenta
That's what we say in Rome
What are those knuckleheads in Athens say?
Musa
Oh, yes, okay, fine
She was here too
She did the same thing
She brought us a whole bunch
Of letters and showed us how to write
How to bring these images into our logos
Oh, fantastic, fantastic
That's Carmenta
Nice to meet you, Carmenta
This is your history, people
Right?
This is the history
It's yours
Sorry, let's go to 1331
Flash, it got my goat for some reason
Did you see that, Julie?
It got my goat
There he is
It's not a heat
Hi there, sweetie
There's my goat
Right?
You remember to imprint the sacred image
We cover up that which is unholy
With the sacred image
You'll remember now the cross
Thank you, sweetheart
That's enough
You can go back
Beautiful
I have my goats too
Alright, let's go
I came armed with goats
Who are we talking about?
We're talking about the child of Agamemnon
Who is this?
Who is the predecessor?
The later civilization
Creates this Abraham Isaac image
It is Iphigenia
And just as the child
Remember Mary is 12
All that stuff in the temple
With her nourishment
They call that the burning off of mortality
Isn't that great?
Anywho, all of that
In order for Mary to be able to produce
The aqua wii type
People have been asking
And I'm not giving out the formula anymore
Because there's nothing that can be done with it
In order to do it
You would have to take the formula
And you would have to give it
To a person over a period of years
Until they develop to a certain stage
That they could then produce
The water of life
It can't be done
It can't be done
Maybe
But I would never say never
Let's go back to the 1331
Take these few
1331, what is she doing?
I'm going to translate
Leave it up
I'm going to translate for you that
But it's very difficult
Because my English
With all my Anglo-Saxon ancestors
Talking with a very limited vocabulary
We couldn't come up with much to talk
With mouth and brain things
The Greeks have some concepts
That are kind of ancient Greeks
Have some concepts
That was a biting there
Ancient Greeks
The language facilitated the communication
You think it's the chicken before the egg
But it's the language that facilitates your development
They're just beginning to study now
See correspondence
Between our development and our language
Well, it turns out it tracks back
To some drug-using
What you would call sorcery
Culp activity
All kinds of deep, dark, secret stuff
Medicine, midwives
It all goes back to that
Yes, it does
Yes, in fact, it all goes back
Okay, Chewy, hit me with the next one
Look what she's doing
She's thusa
What are you doing when you thusa?
You know what tithuo means?
It means to take your incense
And put it on the fire
Whatever method you got
And to sit there and hotbox that stuff
Just breathe in, breathe out, baby
Breathe in, breathe out
I bring you the drug users down
That's why you love it
There's something about you
I can feel you
You've been here all seven seasons
And I can feel you
Like it when I bring that out
You like it
You do
I imagine
I imagine you do
Look what she does here
What is this girl doing?
She's performing catharsis
She's performing the purgation
This 12-year-old girl
Is performing a purgation?
Yes
This is what you call the wedding of Achilles
Did anybody notice
That Medea ends up with Achilles
In Elysium?
Yeah, I thought her name was Iphigenia
It was
Iphigenia ends up with Achilles
This is all about a marriage
It's all about a holy marriage
Don't you Christians
Know something about a holy marriage
We're bringing the new Jerusalem
Which, by the way, is a Greek word
Jerusalem's a Greek word?
Yes, it is
It's the opposite of what you thought
Okay, let's go
That era, mate
Yeah
People, stick with us and we'll do the civilization
You'll love it
I just want you to look at that first line
These are the things that cannot
This is the thing that cannot be
It's made obvious
It cannot be spoken
It cannot be revealed
It is ineffable
What is ineffable?
Amen
The flocks
The flocks is ineffable
That's what she's doing
She is fumigating the ineffable flocks
And you and I are sitting here breathing it in
Oh, God
Are you kidding me?
No
No, this is ancient cult, right?
You said she's 12
Mary was 12 and in the temple
Of Jerusalem
She was there in the temple
Say the cops
Thank you
Shout out to the cops
Copic shirts, show me your tattoo
Love it
Keep up the magic, guys
Oh, God, love those cops
I love cops
I do, I'm sorry
I shouldn't say that
This is for serious people
But I do
Let's go to the next one
Go to the next source, right?
Look at this, people
What is the operatus, right?
It's the forbidden, right?
The forbidden not to be spoken the secret
Look at this, number two, the sacred things
It's ineffable
And then they give you the example of the flocks
Which is 1331
Euripides
What does that say about a goace?
It says a man of mystery
Here, cover that up
They were supposed to take that up
Go to the next one
Fantastic man of mystery
I'll show you a man of mystery
Look here, people
This is Tarkon
Take it down
Who is Tarkon?
You didn't even know this guy existed
Did you?
Did you know?
You can't know the Bible without knowing this
Woo
You can't
These are the dudes who founded your mystery
Fantastic
Who are they?
You need to think around it
Late Bronze Age
Late Bronze Age
Remember, this is a thousand years before any of the Bible
As you know, was invented
Okay, fantastic
We're getting back to something deep
And here's this guy, Tarkon
Who is he?
Think Northern Italy
There's a strange group of peeps
In Northern Italy
And these people
They ain't nothing like the italics
Nope, they aren't
They're unique
Their language especially
That thing's weird
Pulascian
Everybody thinks it's Pulascian
There's theories
In antiquity, there were theories
Gotta love the Etruscan
They gotta finish working on Etruscan
I know they're working on it
And they've made a ton of progress
But they need to
Gloriously give us everything
Beautiful
What about that thing from Limnus?
You guys never got that done either
You know, the watchers are watching you scholars
And although I have to give it to Harvard tonight
For publishing
Beccadelli
I have to give it to them for doing that
Otherwise, I can't give them anything
Yeah, no, I can't give them
It's just poopy
Poopy results, guys
Poopy
There's a lot missed
Let's go to some missed stuff
You guys can learn
No, you Harvard props?
Pay attention
You can learn some things
Let's go to the next text
This is John Littes
And he's talking about Tarkon
Who is this guy around the Trojan War?
What is he doing?
He's a...
Wait, what is that on the second line?
Athoscopos
Athoscopos
What is that?
Take it down
It is somebody who sees
Through that thorn
Yeah, he was a seer
Do you see the seer?
We don't have these today
And you hippies
You psychonauts
No, I'm not talking about you
I'm not talking about you at all
Thank you for being there
I'm talking about ego death
Right?
That's pathetic
That's pathetic
Come back
And what you got is nothing
You go there and you come back
And you got nothing
Because you didn't know how to tune
You didn't know the physics
You didn't know the complexity
It's not just one drug
Blasting you off the moon
And all of a sudden
You got vision?
No, it's not
They're compound drugs
Yeah, and until you've had the mania
You haven't been there
Until you've had the mania
Full stream
You haven't been there
Until you've been into death and back
Haven't been there
You just got to
Get a little atomic energy out of it
That's all
Congratulations
We're talking about the real mystery
And it's going to take more of a hippie
You know, more than a hippie
To crack this thing
We need serious people on this one
Oh, God, I love it
Did you hear how important that sounded?
Take that empire
Okay, Tex, come on
Who cares what I think?
Go to the Tex
Go to the Tex
What happened to Tarkon?
Oh, well remember
Now look, it's going to talk about him
Being a student
You know, who's this guy coming?
There's the student of the
Who's this Teranis?
And who is he?
Well, he's a Lydian
He's a Lydian
Oh, remember, the Etruscans
Probably come over from Lydia
In Asia Minor, right?
And what does it say there?
All this stuff is made clear
In the Tuscan letters
In the Tuscan letters
Fantastic, let's hit the next one, please
Why even mention this?
Well, because I'm going to continue translating
At the time, Evander hadn't gotten there yet
Right, he hadn't showed up
He hadn't appeared, right?
And what happened?
Those letters, right?
By that time, they hadn't been switched over
We didn't have the benefit of
Cormenta, thank you
Genius of human civilization
Totally unrecognized
By any of you thankless mortals
A woman in history
A woman in history
Who gave you the capacity
To develop this
Just sit and think on that for a minute
That's the Evander we're talking about
And because he hadn't come around
Because Cormenta hadn't done her thing yet
We didn't understand
We couldn't work with their alphabet
But it's good that we didn't
Because if we had
All of those things, he says
All of those things that are aporeton
All of those things
All of those things that we cannot speak
All of the necessary
Future outcomes
What?
Yeah
Yeah, he just went quantum on us
You gotta remember, this is
We're working with Pagoya
We're working with that
Oracular philosophy
We're talking to Egeria
So that we can bring the future
Into the present
Yeah
So we can make the future
Isn't that gorgeous?
Now again, remember
We're with that girl
We are with her
Okay, once we lose sight of the cult
We're gone
Amen
Give me some more cult
Feed me, everybody
Get back on that throne
Is everybody on the throne?
Get back on that throne
Okay, bring it down
Bring it down, yeah, that's it
Okay, look at this, guys
What is she doing?
What is she doing?
She's
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, can you hear it?
Hallelujah
What is she doing?
Hallelujah
In this friggin' barbaric language
And doing magic incantations
That's what that says
That's what it says
Just like somebody washing off
The stains of murder
Wait, what?
What can this...
What does this girl do?
In the temple
She sacrifices people
And washes off the stain of murder
With purifications
That involve the purple
If you will notice
Where Iphigenia ends up
And I'll make a reference to Snake Island
If you'll notice where Iphigenia...
This is the place
Notice the place
Oh, God, isn't that gorgeous?
Just imagine yourself there
Imagine yourself there with her
Uh-huh
And what is she doing?
She is purifying you
And the only thing
That's here
Is a purple processing plant
Down at the base
Down the cliffs, right?
Where the water meets Gaia
Right there, they process the purple
And what does she do?
What does the first Christ do?
She sacrifices
She sacrifices
That's quite something to ask a 12-year-old to do, isn't it?
It is
It is
Let's keep going with the text here
That's a beautiful image
Let's look at the next text
We need people to feel like
Taking a lot of things to do
The next one
Look, I just wanted to see some vocab
Look at it
Look at it here
On Ololudzo
To cry loud, to shout out
And look at how smart we are
Look at Roman numeral number two
To excite by bucket cries
What a lame definition
We can't even define what they're talking about here
Because you can Ololudzo
And you can Alaladzo
And you can Elaladzo
And there are three different things
Why?
Because they paid attention
They understood the notes of the cosmos
They understood the seven
Do you have the seven stars?
I don't think you do
I don't think there's a single one of you
Who can bring us to death
And back to life
I don't think you can
I think you should take all your pharmaceuticals
And shove them
You can't do that
Bring me the one with the water of life
Bring me that one
Then your science matters
Then your science matters
And when they cure cancer
You won't be shocked
Yeah
How old do they live?
That's what I want to know
Somebody who's been put on a regiment
That controls gene expression
To bring out your viper
How long do they live?
Under the influence of the drug
It turns out it's longer
Did somebody do some studies on the way?
Figure out what's going on
This is a type of medicine people
That we don't know
I'm releasing to you tonight
That medicine
It's about gene expression
We need it
Why do you think they called her Medea?
Because all the stuff she was doing
With all the drugs and venoms
Was healing people
All they had to do
Was find that stick with the snake on it
She was there
You mean one woman is the founder
Of Bacchic religion, Dianic cult
And everything that paved the way
For Judaism and Christianity?
Yes
Yes
And if we want to change that story
All we got to do is say
Her name wasn't Musa
It was Moses
Yeah, or Moshe
Whatever one
Moshe was my roommate in Israel
Who went crazy
He was
He went crazy
He ran off into the woods
Screaming
But
That's beside the point
Let's go back to the text
Okay, I want to bring you some more
Open up some more seals
Bring you some more revelation
This is fantastic
Hit me with another little bit of vocabulary
Mangeo
Just call forth by magic arts
Call forth
You don't forget
This is necromancy
Okay, keep going
You know
A god can give you the
Horme
A god can give you the urge
Okay, just wanted to say that
Throw that in there
Go ahead
Yeah, so what happens here
This is from the Bible, right?
This is Bible study
So everything that I've set up
Until this point is just context
Kids, for those of you who came
To Sunday morning Bible class
Or it's a Wednesday night now
Grandpa, what's up?
It's okay
It's okay
I know my children
I know what you hear from my Lampkins
Here it is
It's Acts 1935
And what happens?
Oh god, there's some kind of
Rockets going on
And what does he say?
He says to the Ephesians
He says, who is it?
Among men who does not know
That the city of Ephesus
Is the neocoron
Of the great Artemis
Who fell from Uranus
Yes
We
Hear an Ephesus
Turn that down
We in Ephesus
We are guardians
We are keepers
Of that which fell from Uranus
The Artemis
The Artemis
Where did she land?
Where did she land?
She landed on Snake Island
She landed right on Snake Island
And from that place came
This
The human mind
Was a little bit of that burning purple
You can change the world
They called her Medea
Her name is the root for medicine
Fantastic
Let's keep going to the next one
Next one
Here we go
I want to take you
It's going to get a little bit
A little bit rough
I just want to show them
That the neocoros was the
Okay, somebody who is a warden of a temple
That's fine
Okay, keep going
Let's go
Yeah, thank you
Well thrown
Urania
Because none of us would be here
Without her
Now for those of you
With ears to hear
I want you to understand
And this is fun, right?
This is fun
You get it?
I felt somebody out there
Get it?
Like popped in
El Thronus
You know that we've seen
What that Thronus is
Right?
When you have
Polutronus
You have something that's of many
A concoction of many different thrones
And that throne
As in the throne of Satan
Is where you're able to enter that state
Right?
I want to show you some animals
Getting high in a minute
From an ancient text
And I know none of your teachers
None of your colleagues
Have ever talked about animals
Getting high in antiquity
And I wish everybody here
Would send a letter
To Harvard
And Yale
And Princeton that cut off its classic
Classical Greek program
They should send them a letter
Say why didn't you read us
Any of these texts?
No wonder you idiots
Are going bust
Yes
And when I say bust
I don't mean money
You'll always have money, Harvard
I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about your lack of intellectual resource
That's what I'm talking about
Yeah, love it
Let's go to the next one
You can see why I'm so popular
Yeah, no, but they're writing books now
That took my research
They're saying, oh, maybe he's not wrong
Yeah, you caught up
A guy, Brown, said
You'd catch up within 10 years
Took you a couple more than 10 years
And speaking of these animals
Getting high, look
I just want you to look at this
And I'm going to give you a source here
That you've never seen, people
We're in the seventh
And we're going to finish
But before we can finish
I got to throw that really good
This is stuff that you're not going to get anywhere else
This is an almond cocktail
Yeah, you're not going to get this anywhere else
Love it
Bring you your rippides
And what is this?
It's the geoponica
And this section happens to be
On the elements of sympathy and antipathy
Right?
On the physical natures
What are?
He's going to define for us
He's going to show us
He's going to show us
Who's going to show us?
Zoroaster
Now, don't get excited
All you Persian fans
Don't get excited
Cyrus out there, my buddy
Don't get excited
I know, Zoroastrian, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
This is Julian
Or Julius Africanus, excuse me
This is Africanus
And he's using this name
Good
And what happens here?
Look, he says he's going to explain to us everything
But I want you to jump down to Manthana
In line three
Or section three, paragraph three
Right?
And he wants you to realize that
Look, you know, you can have an elephant
Something giant, you know?
Going crazy
Going into mania, right?
My nominos, right?
And what happens?
He can become calm
He can become pacified
Yeah, yeah
With a, with a ram
Look it on, you know
Do you understand me?
Just turn on your decoder there for a minute
Turn on your decoder for a minute
It gets weird from here
And look at verse four
Or section four, if they're not verses, right?
What happens to the bull?
That wild bull
He can calm down, boy
And stop his
Rrrrr
Ride, ride
Bound, how does he, how does he stop?
Because he's bound, he's bound by that
Fruity fruit
You know what I mean?
He's bound by the fruit
Do you know it's a saying in antiquity
You can extinguish
The ardor of the bull
Only with the breath of the virgin
And you think
This is a place of creepiness
Until you realize
That just as the Etruscans told us
Through their prophets
There is a language that must be used
In order to access this area
And that language holds the key
The Heretic stuff is all there
Because of that logos, that reckoning
The language is bringing the reckoning
The language is the device for your brain growth
It's not just psilocybin or whatever
Else they're going to start throwing at people
It's not that
Yeah, it's cocktail, by the way
Water of life
If you had asked me
I would have given you the water of life
Yeah, isn't that nice?
Wouldn't you like to produce that water of life?
Wouldn't that be something?
That's the future
Yeah, coming back
Coming back to that ancient wisdom
Can we get to the point
That we can understand half of what they were saying
I would be happy if I could understand half
Yeah, fantastic
Why? Because it's just
I wish I had the opportunity
I swear, I'm going to end up in Tartarus
Torturing my Anglo-Saxon ancestors
I think
Yeah
Let's go to the next
Here we go
Boom
Yeah, this is Locos
Yeah, go
Locos, wolf
What is going on with this?
What?
Look at the wolf
I just wanted you to see the wolf
Now why am I bringing you a wolf?
This has nothing to do with the Bible
It has nothing to do with...
Yes, it has everything to do with it
I told you we were at the Lupercalia
Right, and I told you the Lupercalia is the prep
For the mystery
What are we doing, man?
The boys are stripping naked
They're running through the streets
And beating people
Yeah, and then we take that same boy
And we put him in front of a statue of
Artemis
And we beat him
Publicly, big crowd watching it
With a leather strap
Nothing serious
Just something to
Make him scream
Right, and what does he do?
He runs up to the ladies
And he slaps and hits him with that thing
He's all naked
Mark Antony was
Supposed to be the leader of the troupe
For the one they made for Julius Caesar
That ended up, but he got canceled
There's some stuff that went on
They didn't like
But, that's Lupercalia
This is the Luper
Right, this is she
Do you remember where that cave is?
Romulus and Remus
Yeah
You know they took her milk
The milk of Mary
Guessed there
Where that comes from
That's from the cave
That's from the cave
Romulus and Remus
And Luper
Great Wolf
Oh, she was wonderful
She was wonderful
A thousand years
A thousand years
That voice
Came forward
Mmm
The quantum physics
You can't appreciate
The quantum physics of this
It's just impossible
It just, religious awe
Is what is the only
Thing that kind of comes close
To appreciation
Let's go, let's go to the next one
I gotta just keep giving this
Yeah, oh what is this?
Orobacos
The fruit of the pomegranate
The fruit of the pomegranate
Did we have that in there?
That was in our wolf
You know what you call a wolf?
You call a wolf this
The Orobacos
And you'll see Bachos in there
What is
What is
Why is Bachos associated with this?
Give me the next one
And by the way, notice
Nicander's Thariac
Thariac is on there
869
We've talked about Thariacs
We all know what they're for people
So guess where we're bringing this
Oh, Orobacos
Of course
This is what means what inspiring Bachos
There's a lot
Of getting Bachos
There's a lot of getting
Entering into that place
The Thuoscopos
The Haruspex
As you come to call it
Thanks to the Romans
The Haruspex is that one
Who sees through
That
Divination by fumigation
Alright
Can you hear it?
Okay, let's go
Let's go to the next one
Sorry, I'm clipping you short
People are getting there
Hurry up man
Nostics waiting
I just want to see a few words
With this horse
And this Bach
Look, you can do the same thing for the women
For the place
Even the locale stuff
Next one please
Oh God, look at this
We're going to read some revelation backwards now
Just to get the purge
And here it comes, yeah
So I was taking in the spirit
To this mountain
You see what the people
Who are the Haruspex
The
People who use
The fumigation
To fly
You see what they're saying
They're taking up in Pnellmati
You know how Mary
Got pregnant
For those of you who are here for the Bible study
Kids
Mary, the mother
Of Jesus
Got pregnant
By God
At 12 years old
Doing
This
By means of the Holy
Pnellmati
The Holy Spirit
You know what the Holy Ghost
For those of you who are in the circles of Christianity
Or have been there
You can go back and remember how it was
A lot of people have written me
And said I came out of Christianity
Thank you very much for doing your work
And thank you guys for saying that
Being nice
People are saying
Hey, we've come out of it
And I know exactly what you're saying
And it makes sense what you're saying
And I want to
I want to explore it now that it makes sense
Okay
That's the perfect
That's exactly why the museum was built
I didn't do anything
I just came in and looked around
Artifacts, it's not mine
Belongs to the muse
Love it, and people recognize that
I love it, I love it
To my old guy, I got an old aged guy
Love ya
Yes
Even from the kiddies
To the
Methuselah
A museum is for everyone
It's for everyone, that's why
When somebody tries to stop you
And I want to ask Neil about this
When somebody tries to stop you
By turning you in
For
Obscenity
Yeah
From Renaissance nudity
I know, there's a lot of this out there
And I know it's just
Targeted
Coming my way
I know that
Don't get desperate people
Don't get desperate
There's always a solution
If you want to shoot holes in the falcon
We'll cover up those holes with crosses
Yeah
We'll cover them up
Yeah, love it
Oh god, let's go
People wanted to hear some of that
I'm holding people extra time
Here's it
Let's do this backwards
He's taken up into the mountain
In the Pnellma
He's flying
Way up high
And what did he see?
He saw Haagian
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
Jerusalem
There we go
Tune that vowel
It's from Hieros
Which means holy
And the
Sigma Lambda Mew root
Which in one case that we know of
Is a form of medicine
Is a form of medicine
Interesting
Do you mean
If you go right now
And look up the etymology
Etymology
Etim
Etim
If you look up the etymology
Of Jerusalem
You're going to find it's Hebrew
And there are guesses from Mishnah
Stuff way later
It just is sitting there
With Greek roots
It just is sitting there
With Greek roots
Something is wrong
The language is topsy-turvy
It is saying
This is no, this is older
This is older than you think
Yeah
And it's later assimilated
Right? As the
Old Testament was written
In the third century
It assimilated, the name back
Translated it
You know those guys with the Dead Sea Scrolls
Do you want the secret of what they were actually doing?
They were sitting there copying
Into Hebrew
The Greek
Yes
They didn't do it because their language
Is so tiny
Yes it was
By then it was liturgical
They didn't have a shot
Of course they were doing the best they could
Because they were trying to build a tradition
Some kind of cultural foundation
The rest of the world around them
Had
Gone into civilization mode
And
If you're going to be in this mode
With the museum in Alexandria
You're going to have to come up with a foundation
We're scientists
We sit and study these things
So this is when Judaism
Is really invented
It is invented then
And it is based on
This older mystery cult
That comes to us from the Bronze Age
Of which this
Ifegania
This force of the woman
Is the founder
I'm looking for that
Queen force
I'm looking for it
We're going to look all through these texts
Until we bring out
Lady Babylon
And let you see the most influential woman
In all of
Earth history
Yeah
That's who we're looking for
Let's go to the next one
We're almost through
Sorry
I'll hurry up here
I just want to see the medicine there
That was Andromachus as well
The wolf, by the way
Can you just go back to the wolf
Because I don't want people to miss this
Look at this guys
Look at number six
Number six
Roman numeral number six
Nickname of Piederasda
Pederast
What do you call a pederast
The wolf
Is it because of
We all have weird impressions
Of wolves? No
It's because it's a cult
And cults
Have symbols
That they use
And when I say symbols
I do not mean
Images, mental images
Metaphors, I'm not talking about that
I'm talking about identification
I'm talking about putting
Two pieces of the puzzle together
That match perfectly
That is the Sumbalon
Give us the next one
Here we go, Sumbalon
Atali, each of two halves
Corresponding pieces of an astragalos
Or any other object
Which two Xenois, strangers
Or any two contracting parties
Broke between them
Take it down
So you make a contract
You break this thing
They come together
Lock and key
It's proof of your contract
It's identification
Hit the next one
You're not going to get this in a bible school
They don't do this stuff
What is that astragalos
They would use knuckle bones
Knuckle bones
And why all of a sudden
Guncretz woke up
We're talking about sortace
And what are the original sortace
They're used with human bones
Have you ever seen somebody's spinal bones
And their neck
Have you ever seen those
You can take those and fill them together
Perfectly, like a little puzzle
You take one dudes, take them out
Fill them together, this is what we do
It's like a wishbone baby
If you break it, there's only going to be
One connector, right
It's going to work, one connection
Here we go, we're making the connection
Can you feel this?
Oh, just fine
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, love it
Give me the next one
Secret code
Wait, what?
This is the same definition of what I just showed you above
I just scrolled down
I couldn't fit the whole definition on the page
What is a symbol on
The word that we use
Is symbol in English, right
Which is not the same thing
What is a symbol on
Secret code
Okay, now
When somebody starts talking about secret codes
Walk out
Walk out, because
99.99% of the time
It's BS
But I didn't bring you
This secret code
These Victorians did
Through the Greeks bringing it to us
And what is the secret code to them
Look at this in the Greek
Mystical
Symbolon
Orgiasmon
Orgiasmon
Oh, you know that's good
You know that's good, don't you?
Love that
Love that word
It's the mystic
Symbolon
The one that they use
In those mystic
Rites of Dionysus
Okay
Now, wait a minute, you're going to say
Wait a minute, you said there were drugs
You told me there were drugs that they're using
Yup, that's good
You said there were songs
Yup, they're singing
You said that there was this frenzy
Sometimes some flash eating
You're going to let me eat some flash
You promised to bring me to a place
Where I could eat some flash
Yes, yes, don't worry
Don't worry
It's all there
It's all there, but this is also there
This is also there
Yeah, a secret code
And what is the secret code?
It's a combo
Get ready, the linguists and the intellectually curious
Will like this
Are you ready?
Turn off the lights
Turn off the lights, just sit there
It's signum
And responsum
It is a sign
Or a push
It is a wave moving forward
And a wave returning
It is a signal
And a response
It is the fitting together
Of those
Vertebrae
Don't you love that?
Don't you love that?
That's what this symbol on is
And that is what is used
Look at this
What are we looking for?
We're looking for the orgiasmos
Look at how the Victorians
Translate this
Celebrating
Of orgia
Okay
What does that mean?
Notice that they're related there
They're related there to Dionysus
The worship of Dionysus
And that's why I brought you this passage
To show you
Is that one? Nope, that one's next
Go to this one
Oh, it's not
No, it's further down
Here, let me see, hang on
This is my fault, not Chewie
This is the passage
I had it in the wrong place
Remember, you told me not to do that
Chewie
Thank you, Chewie
There's another explanation
You know what I mean?
All the women
In this place are totally
I'm translating
Are totally enslaved
To the Orphic rites
They love these
orgiasmos
They really
Get into the
To this thing
And they've been doing it for a long time
They call them the clodones
The mimalones
That's what they call them
That's eponymously what their name is
And, you know, they do many of the things
That
Don't I do?
And especially they do a lot of things
That the Thracian women do
The ones that go and celebrate on
Hymone, Mount Hymone
You know what I mean? They're all doing the same things
And, you know, I think, it seems to me
At least, that this is where
The verb in Greek, threscawing
Comes from
It comes from this crazy
Extreme cult
Activity
And, you know, who's worst at this?
Who's worst at this as Olympias says the text
She is the worst
She's the most zealot
You see that word for zealot? Zealosa
Zealosa
She's zealous to enter
Into that enthusiasm
That state of
Total stoneedness
Yes
What does she do when she's fumigated
Everybody? She brings in
These barbaric
It's not just barbaric
It's strange to us
She brings in these giant
Strange snakes
And what do they do?
They climb up and down people's
People's
Sorry, first where they do
They're in a basket first
She brought out the mystic
Baskets
What happens? They climb out of the mystic
Baskets
They climb up the thersis
And the headbands
Of the women who were there
And they
I love the last line
And they scare away
The men
Isn't that great?
That's Plutarch
Talking about
Olympias
And her getting into the mystery
This is a real thing people
It's a real thing
Okay, we gotta bring Gnostic on
Let me just make sure that's
I'm gonna go ahead and cut it
I'm gonna go ahead and cut it there
There were a couple other things
But I think it's nice
To bring on Gnostic
Let's bring him on
Welcome, Gnostic
Thanks for having me, man
I've kept you for a long time
Jam packed, sources and stuff
I never even heard that
I probably kept you way too long
You know what?
I'm taking a break from some editing anyway
You're about to bring out a new piece
Speaking of which
What's your new topic?
So I'm covering the first
Two centuries of Christianity
And it's not
So people are told
The understanding is that
There's proto-Orthodox
And there's a perfect straight line
From Jesus to Paul
Justin, martyr, Irenaeus
Eusebius and so forth
That's bullshit
The early Christianity was
A lot more wild
A lot more
Ritualistic
A lot more Platonist
A lot more Pythagorean, Orphic style
Bacchic style
It was very religious
A lot of mania
A lot of Eucharist
A lot of taking substances
Going out into the wilderness
Dropping out of society
Having egalitarian societies
And cults
With women in charge
I have a lot of sources
Proving that too
So I want to show people
Early Christianity
Is not what people try to make it as
A lot of times people
Backtrack and say
These people were heretics
And they always were heretics
But the truth is
No one knew that these people were heretics
These people were revered among Christians
Popular
Writing texts in Alexandria
With funding
With support and patrons
These were the real early Christian fathers
And some of these so called heretics
Are
Have genealogies that bring themselves
Into the so called
70 disciples of Jesus
For example
Marcian is a big one
Marcian is the first Christian
To have a canon
A New Testament
And he, according to the sources
Even the people at Haydn say this
That he was a student
Of Thutus
Which is one of the people that Paul traveled with
And his father
Was Philologous
Philologous is
Counted among the 70 disciples
That actually knew Jesus
He's one generation away
So you'd think this guy would know a thing or two
And by the way, in his possession is all
Paul's letters
How does he have all Paul's letters?
It's not like today where you just can fact stuff around
And send emails
If you have a copy of Paul's letters
In this early second century
You know people that knew Paul
You're right there, right?
You're in that world, you're part of that system
Of early Christianity
So I'm highlighting that and then I'm going
I show how the evidence proves this
Then I go into what did they actually believe
What were they doing?
And it's a lot of wild
What you would consider Ba'kiq
Ba'kiq in the sense that
They're going through these ecstatic
Worship ceremonies
Speaking in tongues
Taking Eucharist
And baptisms
And going wild and getting the Holy Spirit
There's a lot of that going on
Because
I have a whole list of these early Christians
And what they were talking about
What they were doing
And that was one of the big ones
Obtaining the Holy Spirit
You would have to go into an ecstatic state
Of ecstasy
And mania
For the Holy Spirit to possess you
And that was important
That's bigger than anything else
So
Yeah, I'm going to show that too
Yeah, no, I love that
I love that
Entering the Spirit, you know what I mean
And all the prophets are doing it
You know what I mean
And all the people, the priesthood
That's getting the voice to speak
In the tabernacle
They're all doing the same thing
They're all performing that same mystery
It's fantastic
I love it, I'm glad that you're
I'm glad that you're seeing it
I hope you can bring us some dirty stuff
Early Christians
I got lots of sources
I got lots of sources about
Some of their ritual stuff
There's Eucharist where semen is involved
Drinking semen
Good
You're going to see it
You're going to see it
I can't wait, I can't wait
I had you on, Neil
Because I wanted to ask you a couple of questions
Very specific questions
Number one, tell me
What is your
Estimation
Of academia, particularly
Bible scholars
And the
Investigation
Of antiquity
What do you
Think?
I'm glad you said specifically Bible studies
Because I've been
Saying this and I'll keep saying it
I think Bible scholars
Seminarian
Academia is like
Not even in minor leagues
Compared to the major leagues
That is classics
I wouldn't even say it's minor leagues
I'd say it's like high school
It's like
It's just junior varsity
No seriously though
That's called the bullshit
To get the best
Best New Testament
Scholar you can get
And their range of
History is just
They're not required
To do what classics are
Classes are supposed to do
And you can tell me
I'm just hearing this from
You and other classes
Who are just like
The current state of Bible studies
And Bible academia
New Testament scholarship
It's so pigeon-holed
It's so basic
Like biblical
You have to learn biblical Greek
Instead of actually
Getting into the attic
And the classical Greek
You just have to learn
You only have to learn the Greek that's in the Bible
That's it. There's a whole book on this
Like learning
Biblical Greek
You're literally just learning the vocab that's in the Bible
So you don't even know what these words are
Atomologies are
And just real quick before you
Comment on this
And then you hear
I don't want to say names
But there's a big Bible scholar out there
Who
Oftentimes
To explain some sort of
To explain something
In the New Testament
You can't explain what's going on in the New Testament
Without having the background of the culture
And the history before it
Christianity just spread up out of the ground
As a miracle
Without any influences
Everyone knows that, that's just common sense
Everything's like that
This person in particular
Starts
Giving an explanation of some of the
Diotic Wars between
Alexander's generals
And it's so bad
They're getting people's names wrong
Getting dates wrong
It's not even like
It's not even like
Associates degree level
Knowledge of this type of stuff
It's like
It looks like this person just found out
Five minutes ago from reading Wikipedia
And then extrapolated some stuff and wrote it down
And it's just like, whoa
And like, that's your ex-
This person was comparing
Seleucus
And how he was the son of God to like Jesus
I think that's what they were doing
And I
Not just remember just reading it
Because five years ago I would have read that
And be like, oh cool, I don't know nothing
Studying the history
The Hellenistic era
Diotic Wars, you know, the Antigonids
The Seleucids, the Ptolemy's
Leicimachus and like getting to know
What was going on in that time
What were these different cults like
What were they doing, what was the culture of the time
Period? And then I read something like this
And I'm like, now I know why
Now I know why classicists laugh
At the state of Bible scholars
Just saying
Yeah, yeah, amen
To that, which is a shame
Because they have those texts
But they
They don't really belong to them
Right, you have to look at it
And this is what troubles me
Because this is what impedes
Renaissance
Is when you take a group of people
And say we're going to control
The media surrounding these
This evidence
As soon as you do that, you get appropriation
Right, that's why you have people
Justifying terrible, terrible acts
Over
God told them to kill all the women
In village and that it was for the glory of
God
When you have a group of people teaching like that
You can
Guarantee yourself 100% of the time
You're not going to get an accurate
Look at that evidence
The evidence belongs to us
The New Testament belongs to us
It's a human document
Part of history
That's what's so crazy
About separating classical
Scholarship
Classical philology
From New Testament studies
Why are they separating those two?
This is part of the same
Classical philology world
That it was written in
So why are you separating it?
You don't take Homer
And just make it its own thing
And then separate it from the rest of the classical studies
Why would you do that?
You don't understand Homer without understanding
Hesiod or understanding
The stuff that happened before
How would you know?
You would just be focusing on Homer
You'd be so pigeonholed and blind
To understand what's going on
Exactly
And why is it you give just this material
To be guarded by these people
Who are not integrated into the rest?
I can tell you why
This is what I think
Because it began
The thing that was controlled by Christians
In scholarship
These very Christian
Universities
These Catholic universities
Dominated that space for so long
And it still affects the way it is today
Even today you get
You know, classical or
You know, PhD, New Testament scholars
That come out of a seminary
And they still have to sign a document
Saying that they believe in Jesus
Even if they don't, they'll just lie and sign it
Just to get their PhD
Why is that even there still?
Right, it's like
Why would you have a...
You couldn't see this in physics or chemistry
Can you imagine that?
You wouldn't take a great astrophysicist
And say, you know what?
All your work is great
Your math is straight on
Nice articles, nice books
But you gotta sign this statement
Because we only want you to present
This material a certain way
And that's why Julian is saying
This has to stop
And I don't think people realize, Neil
This is why I was so...
You know, this is what really gets my goat
Is when...
Can we bring up the goat now?
Put him on too, there he is
There he is, this is what really
Gets my goat
Is the fact that
This material is being
Essentially altered
To be presented to you
In a way that some
Group wants you
To understand it
Right? The reality
Is being fed to you
Through a lens, and all you gotta do
It's all you gotta do is
Shadow that lens
And stand back and look at the text
Look at the text and do what a
Scientist would do
Just do what a scientist would do
And look at the evidence
And say, what do these words mean
All of a sudden when you start doing that
The whole
Propaganda that started
With the early church
And I'm not talking about the freaks
Who were on drugs
I'm talking about the reformers
The church fathers who were trying
To put control
Trying to put that horse
A bridle on that horse, right?
Real quick, let me jump in and say something
About that, because the
Case that these so-called
Gnostics are trying to make
For themselves being the legit Christians
Was that they are
Doing exactly what Jesus and Paul
Are doing, they're getting their divine
Messages from the Holy Spirit
Through inspiration
That's correct, that's
Biblically correct
The herceologists
Or they call them proto-orthodox
I hate that word, there's no such thing
You're looking back and then
You're classifying them as orthodox
Because they won, so these
Proto-orthodox people
You know what they, Irenaeus
Actually says this
That authority
Only comes from a bishop
Because the bishop is the living god
On earth, where
That is so against the
Messages of Jesus that it's not even funny
The guy that's walking around talking
Shit to Pharisees and Sadducees
Because they're all obsessed with the law
And they're obsessed with authority
You think that makes you
That's, why would that be the case
But it, so it's like
How did someone with that message
Win out? Because it fits like a
Glove for a Roman imperial religion
You're not going to let some guys
That are taking, getting
Ecstatic, speaking in tugs, taking drugs
And getting the message from the Holy Spirit
In control of your cultural
Norms, you're going to have
Some guy well dressed
In his nice robes and he's got his
Well written books next to him
And he's, you know, he's got bishops
And all these different cities that he can
Like write to and set things up with
It's way easier to control, it's way more
The logistics of it
Makes way more sense
But for me personally
The idea that, oh, we're right
Because we have bishops
And bishops have authority
Because they're bishops
Over, oh, we're right because
We're getting the divine message from the Holy Spirit
Like, wow
Doesn't make a lot of sense to me, right?
Whether you like Christianity
Or not, this is beside the point
That has nothing to do with the video
What I'm doing is, I'm just saying
Within the Christian world, here's what we're looking at
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I totally get what you mean
And I know that that's why
Becadelli was doing
What he was doing, he was trying to break
Through that authority
And say, look, you know, we're
You know, you don't influence us
And he tried to
Write about the very heart
Of the mystery
And it was so much for that
Control structure that
They, they
Some, one gentleman
Said, people blamed
The Reformation
On the examination
Of the hermaphrodite
Seriously
Your mind is that small
Right?
I just can't believe it, Neil
We're going to be swallowed
If we're, let me finish
With this question for you
If, if we're
In a period
Following a Renaissance
That followed
Dark Ages
That followed the height
Of Roman civilization
If we're in a period that's following
That Renaissance and that
Enlightenment, do you think
Now in society
That we're going forward
Your backwards, are you going to
Where are you going to put us on the
Scale of, you know, progress
Towards classical
Civilization or
Turning away from it, where are we
Well
We're turning, I would say this
We're turning away from those dark
Ages of the church
In control of every facet of society
Even during Reformation
Days, it's like
Either you're a Lutheran or a Catholic
Or a Calvinist, or maybe you're living
England, you're an Anglican
And they control all facets of society
Coming into the Americas
And the French
Were contemporary with the Americans
On this, was the idea
That we need to get away from this
System and allow
You know, freedom of religion
Like that, so
Going, I think that, and that's reverting
Back to the classical age
Of the democracy of Greece
Of
Having your own personal mystery religions
Wherever you are, and not having
To answer to some
Top-down system
In some other city
So I would say moving forward in that sense
Is that what you meant?
Yeah, so do you think you just
Spark something in my brain
If what you're saying is right
We could be in a position
Where there could be
A
Reformation of the church itself
The church could assimilate
The new information that's coming
About itself
And it could change, it could form
Something new. I was thinking
We're just in a place of darkness
Where we're going to go back down
That path of the dark ages
Could be.
You know, think about
Not to get political, not to be political
But I have to say this
The dude who just got
Picked to be the house speaker
This guy is not just a Christian
Like every other person in the Senate is
Everyone in the Senate is a Christian
They're all Christians or
There's a couple of Jewish people in there
And then there's one person who
Considered himself an atheist, Andrew Yang
And the whole Congress
But these people aren't really
Have, they just say they are
They're not really like
They just say it. This guy
Is legitimately
Takes the world 6,000 years old
He thinks God created the world in seven days
He thinks Adam and Eve are literally real
Like this guy is legitimately
A fundamentalist Christian
And if you think about it
If the president dies, the vice president becomes president
If the vice president dies
He becomes president
He's the third most powerful person in the nation
So
Looking at something like that
Then I agree with you
Because it could go either way
Either we as a society
Go that way
In that direction because it's right there
For the taking on that side
What I'm saying about going towards
The principles that Greece
And
Greece and Rome laid out in the Republic
Days and Hellenistic air
Democritus
Demosthenes
Solon giving those laws
And stuff like that
That made civilization
Right?
There's like half of us in the world
That are trying to go in that direction
In the modern sense
Not just do exactly what they did
To have that same
Layout system
But you're right though
There's another half of this society
In another direction
You can see this because people are all over twitter
And they're always talking about
Look at this beautiful church
That was built in 1532
Why can't we build stuff like that anymore
We're so weak today in society
This is what they try to
So they are a strong force
In the culture
Of that type of thinking
So you're not wrong
I don't think you're wrong anymore than I think
I think you could go either way
We're at a fork in the road right now
Yeah
Notice that the guy is also that same guy
As part of this group
That is, you know, they're going to change
Education
They're going to change the way that we look at the world
Notice that they're all saying
The same thing
Christianity produced
Democracy
That our beloved nation is the product of
Excuse me
You could not be
More incorrect
And I know, Neil, that you've put up quotes
To try to yell at people and say
Look, it was
You'll hear people like Ben Shapiro
Will say like, you know
The Constitution is a Judeo-Christian document
Yeah
Really?
It's so bizarre
Because everything you find in the Constitution
You can find
In pre-Christian
Greece
In the laws of Solon, for example
In the laws of the orations
Of Demosthenes
I just mentioned both of them
But even Roman Republic
Constitutions were
Given by the goddess
Yeah
This was understood by everybody
The goddess, whether it's Athena or Minerva
The goddess with the helmet
And the shield and the spear
She is the symbol of the Constitution
Because what the Constitution does
Is it's a divine thing
In this sense
Why is it a divine thing? What do you mean? Is it magic?
Well, here's what it does
Everybody, whether you have a better
Abilities and capabilities of someone else or not
Under this Constitution
This person that you can have
That you can easily
Out
You can easily outdo somebody
Because of your wealth, because of you have
You have access to an army
You control the grain, whatever you are
You're a senator, high up somewhere
And that person is just a plebian
But the Constitution puts up stuff
That protects this person
With their rights
So that you are bound
By the same
Powers, basically
That's what the Constitution does
It's power
It sets up a system where people have protections
Right?
That's the thing that is so important
And I just want to say one more thing
About Judeo-Christianity having
Some sort of claim to this
Because I can see
Why they would say this, but that's wrong
But here's the thing
So we were talking about how
Septuagint
And the Pentateuch was created
In Alexandria
Around 300, 270 BCE
Right?
Well, one of the questions I get from
People who are skeptic of this theory
Will say why?
Why do they care about creating
A Bible for
People in Israel?
Why wouldn't they just write the...
It's a decent question on the face
But it's really simple, once you look at the situation
This is why I talk about the Diodechi
Knowing the history
Knowing what was going on in the world this time
Is so important
Because if you look at the sources
Right around 300, 312, 320 BCE
There's a giant war
Over Israel
And the son of Antigonus
Demetrius
And they fought literally
In Gaza
There's a thousand wars that happened
In Gaza throughout history
This was one of them
And Ptolemy
I just told this story there
I'll tell it to you, it's such a great story
Plutarch tells it the best
He says that
Young Demetrius
So Demetrius' father is
One-Eyed, famous general
Who served under Alexander the Great
And Alexander the Great's father
What's his name?
Philip
So this guy is an OG
He has one eye from war
His son is Demetrius
Now Antigonus is still alive during this time
But he's controlling Greece
He's controlling Macedonia
He sends his son Demetrius to go fight Ptolemy
Ptolemy also fought
Under Alexander the Great
Side by side with this guy's father
So they have a bond
They're like brothers
He's sending his son to go fight one of his brothers
So he goes down
And they find each other in Gaza
And Ptolemy sets up his army
And Demetrius sets up his army
And they fight
Ptolemy destroys them
Absolutely annihilates this whole army
Takes all of his fleets
In the Mediterranean Sea
Takes all of his golden chests that he had
Because you have to
You need funds, right?
Takes everything, all of his tents
All of his horses
All of everything, gone
And now Demetrius is on his knees
Expecting to be executed right then and there
Ptolemy walks up to him
Yeah, you did good, kid
That was good for a first fight
Here
Here's all your chests back
Here's all of your fleets back
You get out of my land
I own this land now
I'm taking all these Jews here
This is the reason why I tell this story
I'm taking all these Jews here
They're my slaves, not yours
Go back and tell your father you lost
Come back in about a year when you get better
And we'll fight again
Which does happen, by the way
But anyways, the reason why I told that story
Is because now Ptolemy controls Israel
He takes hundreds of thousands of slaves
From Israel
To Alexandria, Egypt
About two decades later
Is when this Septuagint
Pentateuch gets created
Now, the question of
Why would they do this
Well, if you can't see it now
I don't know what to tell you because
When you control a land
You have to set up laws
That are
In line with what your ideology is
Ptolemy had all the incentives
In the world
To set up
A mythology
A history
And a set of laws
To govern Israel
He does this, by the way
Russell Gamerkin from Copenhagen Seminar
International
Writes a whole book about this
Showing that 95% of the laws
In Deuteronomy, Numbers and Exodus
Are from Solon
Solon
And Lycurgis
5% of them are found in Babylonian
Laws
So what they did was
They took all the cultural norms
And legends about Abraham and Moses
And all these people
They rewrote these stories
But they inserted new laws
That would be
A beneficial to the state of the Ptolemaic
Empire
And then guess what happened
They let all those slaves go back to Israel
With their new set of laws
And geopolitics
That's what happens in the world right now
When you conquer a new land
You set up a new government
You put a new constitution there
This is normal
Stuff that happens all the time
So that's your answer to why would they do this
Of course they would do this
Why wouldn't they do this
They control that land
Brilliant
Brilliant, did you notice
I want everybody in the audience
To notice
The precise use
Of the sources
Neil is just reading sources
Right, and he's just taking
Material from sources
That's all, he didn't think this up
He didn't sit around and right
He realized it when he's putting the evidence together
So that he can make a case
Like the academic should be doing
But don't
Because he's operating outside
Think about what Neil just said
If that's true
Judaism is an invention
Of the third century
And further down
An invention
Think about what that does
Think about what that does
To this very time in space
Just to say that
Will cause commotion
Right, you're not going to be popular
For saying that kind of thing
Neil, you're standing with the sources
And because of that I will stand
Next to you
There's peer review material on it
Making this up out of thin air
Other people that came to the same conclusion
I didn't even know this
I came to this conclusion on my own
Work, and I found out that other people
Through peer review, through actual academic
Regular study have come to this
Exact same conclusion as me
And
What was I going to say
Yeah, it's
And that's the reason why I was saying that
People say Judeo-Christianity
Are the laws that are
From the Constitution, it's like
No, this is standard constitutional
Republic that are
Set up by ancient classical
Greece thinkers
Like Solon
The very idea that the slave
Religion of Christianity
Could have produced
Democracy
Is a joke
It's why Stelsis is standing there
Saying your slave religion sucks
Right?
It's going to destroy our society
Christians
If I can make an appeal to the evangelicals
This will end up with two appeals
I'll do mine, you do yours Neil
And we'll call it a night
My appeal is to the evangelicals out there
You think what you're doing
Is bringing America
You think you're bringing
Freedom, you're not
You're bringing your own chains
You're taking the democracy
That was built
By people who went to those
Classical sources
For their inspiration and said
Oh, democracy, Athenian invention
Sounds good, let's try it here in America
You're taking those people's
Work and you're destroying it
So that you can be enslaved
Enslaved to
A theocratic
Orange monster
That's what you're doing
Morons
It's you people
Who will drag down this country
And I'm not the one who said it
Thomas Jefferson said
The greatest threat
To the fledgling American democracy
Is the Christian church
Right
Hadn't been a lot of other
You know
Constitutional fathers
Whatever you call them
A lot of them were saying this stuff
Franklin
They're all were
Even the
And yeah
They were friendly to the churches
Because these are people living in the nation
They're not going to
Genocide Christians
It's not what they're trying to do
It's just that you don't let that
Be the power
Don't let them have the power
It's that simple
Be a Christian over there
But you're not taking control
Because your system is just
The last three, four hundred years
We can see over in Europe
They're not doing okay over there
And I just want to say something else
About the idea
That it's an invention
Well
Here's one something I want people to think about
Because the question would be
How do you know it's an invention
How do you know they weren't already
Doing something similar before
Well
We have time capsules to show this
The first time capsule
Is the Phoenicians going down
Going over to Carthage
And what do they believe in
Is there Abraham's stories over there?
No
They're worshiping all the same gods
Everyone else is worshiping
Interesting
And they start colonizing
After 700 BCE
They're still colonizing
So it's like they're right next to them
Why aren't they
How come they don't know all this King David stuff
They just don't
I'll even go closer to 300 BCE
And 400
Between that 400 to 500 BC
You have a large amount
Of Jews moving down
To Egypt to Eliphantine
And they left traces
We have physical text
In Aramaic
From this time period
And this is 400 to 500 BCE
This is after
Well this is like
Contemporary with the Persian period
Persian period, it's second temple
They should have a whole Torah by then
They should have the whole Bible
They should have everything, nothing
They don't have anything like that
They don't even say the word Judaism
Doesn't exist in this text
There is no Torah in this text
There is no
Legends about Abraham
Yahweh, yeah that's there
We know Yahweh is pretty
He's an Iron Age God
But guess what
He also is doing
They're also worshiping Osiris
And Isis and Mott
And Cunum
And Horus
So it's like
And Patah
Standard Polytheistic Egyptian stuff
Written in Aramaic
By people that call themselves Jews
And wonder that Tacitus comes along
And says they were just
They were worshiping
Set on Crete
And ended up
Ended up going elsewhere
And you know what bothers me about that
If you read the
I think the Oxford translation has
A little commentary on the bottom saying
Most scholars think he's wrong
Or something like that
But we know for a fact
That the Philistines
That are living in Gaza
And those cities
And on the coast
Who are Canaanites
They are part of the same
They have a Phoenician
Alphabet and everything
They are from Crete
So is he really wrong
For saying that they came from Crete
He's not, he's looking at the
Geography and he's looking at his
He probably has source of history
Mentioning when the Pleskians
Fled from Crete
And went in different directions
And that was one of the directions they went
They became the Philistines
Pellistet is in the Egyptian sources
And it comes from Pleskian
And I'm not the only one that said that
There's like ten different scholars
Who have pointed this out
Pellistet probably means
Probably is a derivative of Pleskian
I love that
I love that
I hope it can be
Put up even more
It's a frontier
That would also mean that Pellistine
That would also mean that Pellistine
Comes from Pleskian too
Those Philistines are Pelioi
Man, they're old
They were there before
Even according to their own Bible
The biblical text even says
The Philistines were there before they even got there
So even they had
No way around that one
What happened
To the Canaanites
That were there
Everywhere you go in Israel
You dig down deep enough
Some kind of Canaanite development
And they're all gone
They're all gone
What happened? Do you think?
Let's just predict the future
And this is terribly serious
But satanic initiation is terribly serious
If we have all of these people
That have been in effect
Wiped off of the map of history
In antiquity
Because you don't have any Canaanites walking around
You see any Canaanites?
I don't see any Canaanites
You see any Edomites?
No, you see any Ammonites?
You mean there's a group of people?
Yeah, there were
Just like languages
Just like languages, Neil
People get wiped out
I'm wondering
Is that what we're watching now?
Are we watching that history develop?
People say
You're going to be political
The whole world right now is looking at this
The entire world
Is looking at Israel and Palestine
They're watching this
So all I'm asking is
As a historian
As a scientist
Are we just doing it again?
Ptolemy and Demetrius fought there
The Egyptian pharaohs fought
The Hittites in this region
This is like the stadium
For wars or something
This little Gaza Strip for some reason
Always right there
You know that's why
You know that's why the evangelicals love it too
They love it because
This is exactly what they prophesied
This is what we've all been saying
For so many years
And writing down these novels
And left behind
We're all sitting there in our pews, Neil
Christians, we're all waiting
Now don't tell anybody
But the Christians know
That the Jews
Will be wiped out in the end
They already know that
And they're rooting for them
They're waiting in the backstab
Once enemy number one is gone
Which is the Muslims
And then all of a sudden it's going to be enemy number two
It's messed up
In the meantime people die
In the meantime people die
People, children dying
I'm not sitting there choosing one side or the other
It's a difficult situation
But it's not good
I'm not sitting there rooting for one side to kill the other side
That's not what I'm doing
I'm just getting sick of watching
Of kids dead
I'm just getting sick of looking at dead kids
You know what I mean
So messed up
Welcome to the messed up world
Somebody turned up the thermostat
With a mental thermostat I think
So I'm going to give you the second last word
And then I'm going to hail Satan and call it out
So just give me a shout out
Of whatever you want to say
Man, just check out the sources
Get acquainted with the ancient sources
And get an understanding
It's a big world
It's a big world, it's a big history
And
There's never, it's never
There's enough for everybody to
Come up with something and come up with
Some understanding
What happened?
Because history is kind of a mystery in a way
We don't have it all fleshed out
There's some
There's some things to look into
You know, it's
It's open for anyone to go
And explore
And bring something back and show people
Because it's vast
Everywhere you go, every part of the world
Yeah, amen
That sounds like something spoken by
Somebody who's guarding the doors of the museum
I love it Neil, I'll stand by your side
You and I in Tartarus baby
Love it, love it
I'm going to end up by saying
You know what we've just attained
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
On a wave
Why did you ever change your name?
On a wave
Why did you ever change your name?
Hail
On a wave
