Let's see, you've got a question for me here. Let's read it. I have just one very important
question. What were you doing with that naked kid with whom you're arrested with at 4 a.m.
in the public park? Oh, yeah, you're referring to Mark 1451. I was sharing the Gospel.
The good word. I know what it looks like. Yeah, listen, trust me, I was already canceled
2,000 years ago, so I don't think I could be canceled again. That's all right. I love you.
Stay blessed and try not to do anything I wouldn't do. Amen.
