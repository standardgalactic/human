I appreciate you supporting me before the channel started and I'd like to give you some
good content now.
Today is the first in a series that I'll present to you in which I will turn to
a variety of practitioners who feed upon the myth of antiquity. These are nostics in the flesh.
These folks are possessed by ancient demons and I've got one here with us today.
So everybody please meet Dr. John Price. He is at the leading edge of the
Jungian world and he will determine the future of how this art develops. You can consider him a
master. John would you just regale us with some of your background? I think you overstate
you slightly overstate my position although it's appreciated but I would lead by saying there are
real masters that I look to and their insights are held in books and in experiences and
I consider myself a student and a humble student and somebody who is
consistently curious and ready to learn and be receptive and to learn and I do think that
any teacher really does need to be very clear about how much of a student they really are
and as soon as they stop that they become they turn into if you stop with like the
the richness and the curiosity of a student you just you become kind of stale and there's no
the buddhist call it beginner's mind this shenri or shizuki wrote a story wrote a book called
beginner's mind so I try to approach this content because we're dealing as you said with mysteries
and I certainly can't make any any concrete belief out of what is beyond so I think Jung is a really
good intermediary who studied the psyche and the psychology of what I would say on some level
and this is a pretty large statement but studied the kind of the known the the ways in which we
consciously relate to the unknown and so he was really able to say I don't need to make theological
assertions I can just talk about what's happening psychologically so that's kind of my
lane is to be in the world of psychology and looking at most of what comes up in the mysteries
from the perspective of psychotherapeutic intervention and ways in which that psychology
can help us understand how the perennial nature of the mysteries exists in pretty radical ways
that we continue to to see throughout culture and throughout history so I think it's important
John that people recognize that you've been talking about mystery and its operation and you are
yourself a practitioner the audience should know that you have you have been to places and seen
things that many of us would find difficult to deal with and you are at this nexus of human
suffering and medicine and so when you talk about mysteries I think people people were listening to
this should appreciate the fact that you're talking about the practical application of those
ancient forces because you talk a little bit about I um I wanted you to tell the audience
who you're um education wise where you've been and tell us about this think tank excellent
and your involvement with them so I got two bachelor's degrees one in interpersonal communication
in speech communication it was kind of a way of navigating the complexities of public spaces
and and speaking to people and I thought it was great but primarily I was interested in just
getting a degree because I was playing music at the time I was really my my heart and my interest
and then given a series of wild events I was put into a therapist's office or I chose that
sounds bad I I I sought out a therapist and I thought that it was pretty magical what was
happening in that space I I'd primarily been pretty guarded or protected against going into
those places I think for good reason because being self-reflective is and I'm moving into
discomfort it's voluntarily moving into discomfort because what we learned consistently from all
of our religious traditions is that one of the fundamental natures of human reality is that we
suffer and so the the inevitability of facing that suffering is just what you get for the
cost of admission into this reality as a human so I was in that space for myself and my young's
very interested in what's called the wounded healer and of course that is a thread that permeates
the healing arts that that those who've been hurt either it's not so either or but we could
say the spectrum is those who've been hurt can tend to hurt other people taking out that hurt on
others or that can be transmuted into something that becomes kind of a healing endeavor where we
work to heal and to repair people with what's been separated or fragmented or hurt or amputated
or cut off or whatever language you want to use and you're dealing with people who
have been victims of sexual trauma for example real dark difficult places to go right I mean
that's you you crawl into those spaces right that's the the training when I did my my second
bachelor's degree I was trained in what's called trust-based relational intervention so it's working
with children from trauma working in primarily adoption and foster care so as you can imagine
in those communities there's a lot of darkness you know the hidden I don't mean evil of course
there is is that but these are parts of development that are hidden and that are rejected and are
disowned and so when when any of us are so for that burden of not being connected and in a meaningful
way with what psychoanalysts call a one good enough parent a good enough source of nurturing
then we we really struggle later on so the course of my development involved childhood trauma I I
got a master's in clinical psychology and I worked a lot with adolescents and I was looking at addiction
and certain spiritual pathways including Buddhism as a as a way of kind of healing addiction and
then I started my doctorate in Jungian psychology and that's when things got weirder you know like
they and I love that it got really weird really quick and because I started studying religion
and religions and philosophy and metaphysics and anthropology and just touching on all those
arenas but primarily looking at it through the lens of of healing and therefore hurt and how
you know how we get hurt and how we can live out that hurt or look consciously at that hurt
and try to not repeat it in ways that are unconscious so for those of us who are living
in the apocalypse and about to enter the second half what do you do what do you do for us you
know recently I saw that stress related mental illness is up and trauma lots of trauma lots of
lots of forceful trauma out there what do you do how do you intervene using your magic that
Esalen is a is a really wonderful institute a learning institute an experientially based
learning institute that started in the 60s ideas kind of in the late 50s I can't recall but I
actually in my podcast I interviewed Jeff Kreipel who's really involved in Esalen and he's written
the book on Esalen and I interviewed him maybe a year ago as I was heading out there to do my first
retreat on fame I was looking at the psychology of fame and shadow and not necessarily fame from
the perspective of the celebrity just how all of us seek to be known or seen I mean that's typically
where we feel the most wounded as if we've been seen and and where we feel alone and isolated
is a place that hurts and so fame being seen or being renowned is kind of the antidote or viewed
to be the antidote to this existential angst of aloneness so and I wanted to see the way that
our culture plays that out those shadow patterns so Esalen is is a real center point of counter
culture movements you know where all of the all that can't be included in the popular discourse
of the academy or of more social spaces you know given that as you increase the amount of people
in one situation in one setting it waters down or sanitizes the ability for us to
not be ideologically minded because I think as we get larger in population we take these shortcuts
and our identity and kind of borrow from others and we don't do the heavy lifting so I think real
religious um early religious groups or communities were small groups of communities so Esalen is a
small group I'm not saying they're religious in fact they would Jeff would talk about something
like they he says nobody captures the flag at Esalen meaning that nobody really lands on a
certain ideological approach whether it be spiritually religiously or metaphysically
although there is a pretty strong current of idealism or against physicalism which
to your point you know I think and I may be going way far afield here that
we have we have done a really good job as human beings of creating a lot of creature comforts you
know one of the things we do is create tools and extensions for us to battle against discomfort
and achieve elements of pleasure you know whenever we can and so what happens is systematically we
get a little bit detached from um from suffering from our own suffering because we spend so much
time trying to get out of suffering so places like Esalen for example are these meaningful
centers that have allowed um conversation and experience that really matters that's kind of
beneath what the larger culture would say is uh is appropriate or necessary and Esalen's been really
thinking for a long time about these counter cultural movements um how to how to give a
space for people to have the conversations that maybe aren't be having aren't aren't had in public
spaces so from from my experience there it was leading a workshop last year on fame and shame
fame and shadow and then this coming year in 2023 uh with my friend and kind of co-conspirator
Rodney Waters who's a training union analyst he'll finish in Zurich next year with his diploma in
analytic training and he's a classically trained pianist and I'm I've got a background in music
and so we're doing a workshop on music and ecstatic experience and of course drawing
from a lot of these mysteries currents you know we're we're looking at Pythagoras and
Egyptian tonal tonal traditions that chance the way that the the I and I'm speaking like a neophyte
here but the the way these vibrations are are on a cosmic and archetypal level manifested in our
personal consciousness and how certain frequencies and tones can be used in ways to generate alternate
states of knowledge and experience so we're running this workshop on how to how to create those
experiences using music and tapping into these currents of antiquity. John I have to I have to
interrupt you and confess it's beginning to beginning to sound a little culty.
What do you mean by that man? I can smell the the ancient incense in the air I'm wondering I'm
wondering. It's only because I'm burning some in here right now. Since we're since we're in the
beginning of what's inevitably going to be the psychedelic renaissance and now the psychotropic
drugs have made it into the you know possible treatments for different medical problems medicine
is this inevitable that it's going to make it up to you that it's going to make it up to the people
who are on the front who are dealing with these victims of incredible trauma. I'm wondering do you
see a place do you see a place for integrating the kind of ancient practices that they were doing
in antiquity with the drugs and the the initiations and the ceremony that reinforces specific images
the things that give you the idea that you're born again. Do you think those ancient magic
practices ancient cults do you think that they have any bearing on the future the potential
future tell us the future John. Well I think they already do I mean I think that in large part
that's one of the reasons why I'm studying them is because for example in psychotherapeutic
traditions right now it we're very interested in what can be measurable you know it's it's
kind of shifting but for a long time behaviorism started coming into fashion and so of course what
could be measured and observed was what mattered and it's kind of a dire a dominant way of seeing
seeing the world it's also an extension of how we operate you know what what we can't
taste touch feel see and measure in some way we reject and this is what I mean William Blake was
talking about this this has been a current that's existed for a long time I draw from his well because
I think for a long time I was drawing from his well I was reading a lot from Blake when he was
taking on the empiricism of scientism which is a limitation it's a scientist is a process
it's a very good process it's an important process that we that we need to use to provide structure
in how we interact with mystery how we come to know what we know but what happens is it becomes
something that reifies itself and of course believes it's exclusively the pathway to understanding
and to gaining knowledge and what these earlier traditions are really looking at is that knowledge
is not limited by what can be determined scientifically knowledge can exist in what we
would call in the imagination and so we're really playing with attention between a dominant
cultural norm of what can we you know the sensory systems what we can measure what can be objectively
true versus these other forces these unseen forces that exist that we can relate with or relate with
us and we can at times connect in a conscious way with these forces and and and emerge in a
transformed way so trauma you keep talking about trauma trauma I think first of all trauma is
inevitable we're all traumatized there are moments in which we are overwhelmed by energies that we
are not ready to contain okay okay hang on with that thought right there because now you're making
me afraid you're making me afraid because what you're saying is is you know you're still squarely
in the cult realm right but you now you're drawing on ancient forms of possession and things that
you're going to get some resistance if I can be an oracle for a minute you're going to get
resistance to this am I not right I mean you're basically using sorcery on people to program them
to give the problem with this yeah the problem with this is that we've allowed for the idea of
sorcery to take on an exclusively negative connotation and rather than talking about working with
immeasurable forces and unseen aspects of our nature from intuition to you name it
what what what what this is saying essentially is because intuition or because these energies we
could say aren't subjected to the kinds of modeling that we currently have we reject them
and so and and there are earlier times in our existence that didn't subject the knowledge that
they possess to these restrictive and limited ways of engaging with consciousness or with these
kind of mysterious forces so I think in some way it's really a cultural critique it's that our
culture hasn't really allowed for us to be in a both and kind of space where we can have room for
um ceremony and ritual and incense and placebo whatever that may mean these
connection and relationship you know go to a hospital there's no relationship
there are and I don't mean I I maybe I'm speaking too too feeling I know hospitals are really trying
but if you're really trying to heal like genuinely trying to heal you're going to include certain
images like nature you're going to allow for certain patterns like sleep you're going to
help promote really healthy eating and and allow for the body to heal because you know a body and
you know how about course can you have orgies well now I mean see that's when you say stuff
like that it's like where the come from like what is that you know like and so I don't know I don't
know the one thing I do want to note here that's so important is I I think sometimes what people
can do is look to the past to try to replicate what was done there's a reason that christians call
them temple prostitutes right the vocabulary is hilarious but what do we do John is there's some
way of getting my audience naked in the wilderness um in in an attempt to in an attempt to bring them
back to uh an understanding of reality and of history are you one of these guys who who they're
talking now about the brain and the fact that it has a quantum aspect to it which I don't know why
that surprises anyone but okay um how how do you think it's worth let me ask this question do you
think it's worth perpetuating bringing the mystery now this this whole series is about Lady Babylon
and her cup her cup of pornea and that's why ultimately you know I brought us to the orgy
um can we do this John can we bring this back in order to heal all of this incredible trauma
it's it's funny you say that I think certainly there we let me try to work through this it's
not necessarily going back as if it's linear I think what we're saying is that hey we have these
tendencies and patterns that have started to take us over that don't really serve us and we want to
live a more full existence and and something about these cult traditions like like not not
current cult language I mean like ancient mysteries cult language because their cult is such a loaded
term that to use it people get their defenses up really quickly so if we talk about what's
happening in the mystery cults these are small my my projection right are small groups of people
that build their their small religious spiritual practices around some kind of an alternate state
of consciousness or knowledge and they engage in certain practices like chanting or restricting
food intake or going into a cave or taking drugs or doing these really intense practice pain was
involved uh what we know is that those those kinds of practices tend to destabilize the the the the
narrative of identity and ego that's consistently um uh that's the consistent lens we see through
as humans and so if if we destabilize that then some other form of awareness tends to come on
and and in our culture we don't really have a landing pad for that except in the counterculture
back to eslan I mean there's there are folks who've been studying this stuff for a long long time
but it's hidden and it's it had to be hidden okay I'm gonna feel like we've got a couple threads
that are hanging out there but I want to be I want to be mindful no no so you're not promising
you're not promising any cult initiations but you are working a magic that is uh is a revival
it's part of a renaissance of ancient um human magic um bronze age bronze age and and beyond and
I heard a really good so I can I can at minimum I heard a really I interviewed somebody recently
and we're still working on when it's going to come out his name is edward beaver and he's a um
he's I had this book here he wrote a book called magic in the modern world and his other book that
I interviewed him on is um the realities of witchcraft witchcraft and popular magic in early modern
europe edward beaver and when I asked him the question um what what is magic or what is uh
well I just said that what is magic we were talking about witchcraft and he just said magic is a way of
tuning your uh nervous system and I while I think that's a reduction right like I get it
that I don't want to necessarily say hey let's reduce this to um to simply our physiology I also
understand that that given the nature of we're not a split we're not a we see things in dual form
and this is certainly a dual existence but we're a unified experience and so
there's something about being in the body and recognizing the ways in which this body behaves
and how we really do need to work with our nervous systems and if and I think that's magic and I
think that's certainly therapeutic to to help somebody work with the magic of their own nervous
systems and therefore what the way we do that is through ritual through ceremony through conversation
through relationship through modeling through group practices um through paying attention to a
master and kind of watching what they do always live this way part of what I think is developing
is the recognition that we actually need to have these practices we have a religious and spiritual
nature as human beings and we've not I mean religion is relegated to some some guy in the
clouds with like a staff that is going to like bolt you with lighting like that's that's not what
religions look at John why do you think it is that that image of the mother is so powerful
and you're in your exposure to the depths of the human mind in your practice and your therapy
what do you think it is about that mother image and is it possible that that is what the histories
are that the mysteries are drawing upon when you are initiated into the great mother or when you see
the queen of the underworld rise in front of you is there something about that power that maternal
would you call it an archetype I don't know can you just address because I would actually say and
is this may be counterproductive in your endeavor but I would say it's in language like the queen
of the underworld has a certain time stamp on it and that's one thing like we are talking about
I like the practice where we actually can't use the name God we can't say Yahweh it's something
beyond our comprehension so when we're talking about these kinds of forces we're we're talking
about forces that are beyond our comprehension and so we I think we need to be careful how we
conceptualize with that said I like to think in terms of layers of this kind of consciousness
because on the one level the mother is you know the ground of being the the the the the the raw
potential of creation the the the the formless through which we're formed you know and and that's
not we're using words to describe those kinds of images sometimes we can get lost and and believe
that the image is what that points towards the image points us towards a reality it is not the
reality so you also have on that thread you have from this kind of cosmic raw potential
undefinable formless empty nature all the way over to your personal experience with mothering
and so this this theory is that we all have this kind of material or maternal structure
this matrix through which we operate and and then our personal experience is a mothering color
the experience of that archetype or that image and so okay John when does that mother figure
when does she transform into the harlot or into the horror when does the lady Babylon
who provides the cup of her communion which is similar or which is a fluid substance brought
by her porneia when does that mother become the lover at what point do we grow up John
as boys being initiated into the great mother at what point do we enter which we grow into the
state of sexual beings I mean is this a place that you can work with therapeutically oh yeah
sure I mean this is this is an important transition and and in in number of ways for both young
young boys and girls the mother is the not only first love but original
original potential through which that child is formed and out of her the child is born you know
like that's the kind of the nature of all this and so those threads are interwoven in our existence
in ways that are really powerful so to speak of mother especially when you are in a culture
that is devoid of mother the the my projections onto certain militant structures it's a very masculine
male dominated landscape and so I think I think on some level when you have that tendency in the
outer world that way in this instance that mothering part goes to the underworld and she's
played out in unfortunate ways and oftentimes he's never able to recognize what he didn't get from
his mother or what he still yearns from his mother or what he still needs from his mother because
to stay tied to that is in some ways to stay a boy or a child so so there are there are ways our
culture hasn't really established the necessity for us to become the individual not the individual
but the individuated person and identity that we were created to be on some level so that brings
on you you mentioned boys and initiations that brings on rob rob introduce yourself and we're
going to give you here's the game if you do this right you get an all expenses paid trip
to elizia you get to be experience the initiation and you get to see her rise that's what that's
what we're going to do um rob tell us about yourselves rob is the neophyte um so introduce
yourselves undress get metaphorically and show us show us who you are and this this mogus that
i've got with me today dr john price um he is going to help you he's going to help you to discover
yeah your your rebirth um please introduce yourself rob he already has thank you thank
you i'm honored to be here thank you john it's it's it's great it's great to be in your company
thank you uh you are it's all your fault essentially it's all your fault while i'm here i'm so
why i'm here today and it it's it's been a fantastic journey it started with you
and um then it went into an email then it went into a few comments then it went into
pretty much a research study that's lasted until today and hasn't ceased until today
until today i'm still receiving books related to the topic that you all talk about and um
that's my story essentially is i've been persistent enough to get in touch and try and
tap into the the culture what you're brewing what you the the kind of um the kind of collective
consciousness what you what you're gathering with your channel with everything you're doing
and that is one thing what is fantastic but then the next thing is aiman himself
which is a standout it's a standout podcast in my opinion that that podcast with aiman there are
brilliant podcasts but that that podcast with aiman is is profundity isn't it it's it's beyond
what you would normally expect to hear on a podcast so i paid him i paid him to say that don't
don't take that no i paid him to say that i i completely grabbed my attention tell us what
tell us what the tell us what the queen's pretty council and i'm talking about your
one of your departed queens of your great island tell us you've been listening to the
to the bits on the nazis and the the reformation yeah we all we all know that this is an element
that we're having to deal with now and so you know it it may be a trauma that john is able to
help unwind and ultimately i'm interested in could we put evangelicals into this initiation
in order to bring them to a point of rebirth can i i want to jump sorry to jump in on it i
really i want to say something as we go into this because this is important if we're talking about
mothering we need to understand the kind of energy energetic directions of where the wound
happens because if we all have a fundamental need that's essentially empty right i just have this
vessel this this riverbed that needs to be filled and it needs to be filled by mothering but i'm
going to experience mothering in primarily on a spectrum of one of two directions either too much
or not enough and and that's therein lies kind of the the rub which is the ways in which we get
these dynamics that are played out in our individual lives and our collective lives so i
i just felt remiss if we didn't kind of position what where the wound occurs because i can be
wounded by too much nurturing if i don't have any structure if i'm always met always love this is
back to the story of the buddha right like in the buddha the father was saying hey i'm going to keep
you here uh sex drives and rock and roll are going to keep you um in love and you know present and
he says i got to leave that was too much of a good thing right too much good food too much sex
too much pleasure too much not enough same kind of dynamic we're going to get hurt and the that
that thread that initial kind of essence will play itself out unconsciously over time so i
sorry to jump in but i wanted to at least plant that seed and rob dude great great to see you on
on this random sunday thanks john no no problem button in that that is what what you've said
that is uh it's it's quite profound it is what what i've um gathered from what you're saying is
i i often think about the womb you know and the the weight of being carried in that womb
for nine months to to any any soul any person who's within that womb that that's the place
where you first start receiving your your signals from your environment and you start forming any
in a certain way i was i was thinking about this not just just yesterday as i was thinking about
when i when i when it when the sperm meets the egg and you what you what you start is a war
essentially how it's described in the in a midwifes magazine i read about pre clamping
what you start is a war essentially where genes are knocking out other genes and the the fight
is from both sides both sides a fight in each other to win the whatever that gene or that cell
is going to be and the important part of it is there has to be a balance there has to be that
ideal balance between the two genes hitting against each other because if you don't have
that balance you you develop pre-eclampsia where one gene is becoming dominant over the other
therefore it's a worrying thing and sometimes you have to you have to be taken in early and
perhaps give birth early but that's the the very start the the the inception and the
conception of the human what's going to develop into what we're discussing and
what what what what what what becomes a nazi essentially but that's the mothering aspect
and that womb aspect is something we all seem to have a craving to go back to and maybe maybe
there's something in that with the caves with the with the need to go back into a womb environment
to find ourselves again it's just so interesting you use the the womb as the as that image you
know because because we i'd like to offer up another the additional piece to this which is this
kind of psychoanalytically based idea that we are these beings that will repeat or seek out
what's happened in our history we are a collection of our histories that continue to play themselves
out the other side to this is something very interesting which is emerging with the great
mother that there's a an urge inside of us to connect with not so much moving backwards into
the womb but ultimately surrendering to our own death and recognizing that this human existence
will merge with the great mother to use that language system once again and that we have we
are teetering between the balance of that initial womb experience when we're born into form you
born into form you know and at conception to when we are dissolving this physical form
and merging with the great mother at the end of our lives and so there's and and and that's the
the pool that we're operating in all the entire time interestingly enough so there's something so
deep about this you know totalizing matrix that we're in so if rob is a if rob is an ancient Greek
we'll say he's a thration we're making thration and he brings up the womb and you talk about death
and i read a Byzantine manuscript on the the uterus and why it has the names that it does nobody
ever reads the medical stuff i don't know why but um that it's compared to a tomb and it's considered
to be that that that dark emptiness that dark emptiness from which the great mother brings life
and so right right away it's cyclical what would you say then to rob if rob is sitting there and
he's your thration and you're the priest and you've got him in california strip naked because i i've
you know i know you can do that i know you have the power to do that and he's you know in our
conceptual world he is an initiate so he's gone through the beginnings of the fasting and the
proper health you were talking about health care before you know because what you what you're doing
is you're reconstructing that temple of Asclepius yeah so he's been there for a few days incubating
and you've got him now and you're talking to him while he's under the influence and he comes up
with the womb what do you where do you go from there make it visible for us so we can see how the
hypnosis works on on rob would you would you mind doing that i totally although i gotta say it's so
situational and uh because victor frankle said something that i like very much in his uh book
man search for meaning that if you do the same thing with any one patient if you do the same
thing with two patients you've messed up with one of them and so there are there are real i'm very
mindful about any systematized manualized approaches for healing which is radically
the individual right then excuse me so with that said that i can't really um i can't really
acknowledge the intervention to use a blunt term um because i don't know necessarily what
the diagnosis is now so let me again with that said i'm not giving medical advice here
but uh the first thought that i had if rod if you're in the middle of that then my job is to get
the fuck out of the way you know like there are there are times when i i think like when i used
to play in bands you know i used to love the i still love the musicians who myself included
who tastefully know when to play and when not to play i mean you surround yourself by people who are
um incredibly trained musicians that know how to play single you know maybe a couple of notes
in a very tasteful way and it supports the song and so as a clinician or as this priestly class
that you're talking about almond i think a lot of times it's knowing when to back up and when to let
because the the great mother has wisdom that i don't my job is to create an opportunity for
you to connect with the great mother so you're you're causing your patient or your person that
you're initiate you're causing them to be possessed just like they were rob would you say it's fair
that that john is trying to possess you with that power that he's in focusing you know bring it is
watch watch now he's going to say some things to you that are going to enhance that right and it
brings it out how do you feel as the initiate going through this assuming you know uh you know
you're under the influence of some very strong formulae that i'm translating and that are
beautifully intricate we have no idea what that nobody's gonna be able to figure out that chemistry
but say i've put you rob onto the venom you're on the venom now and you're you're working with
john where's your mind confident confident in john is just one a certain amount of rapport
with me through the integrity that is approached that with so now i'm i'm with john and the next
thing he might say could be relevant and i might take it on board a little bit easier than i would
have done if he'd said something different if you know i mean if he hadn't come over so genuine
i might not have taken that on board so easy does that make any sense did he just did he just
figure out one of your tricks john well yeah i mean i wouldn't it's not so and this is great trick
um so so the way we function like these are just truths of truth capital t
as i said it earlier that there's a very early stage of development called trust versus mistrust
and if we haven't had that conflict resolved at a very early age we will have to work on that conflict
later um so so one of my jobs would be that if somebody comes in and they're just not trusting
i have to work on the level of trust and i've got to get their animal to trust my animal
and that doesn't happen because i say nice things or i know a lot of stuff it happens on a deep
unconscious animalistic primitive nature and if i have somebody in my
now now and this is one of the things i mean you and i've talked about this before like
i don't operate under what let's say cognitive behavioral therapy has an approach called flooding
flooding is what you do somebody's got a spider phobia for example they come in my
office and i just have 10 spiders i just release in the room and i lock the door
and they just got to deal with it and that can be effective it can also traumatize
um so we have to be very careful right so i i'm trying to assess what level of intervention
is is is valuable and the first level of intervention in my modern approach by far is trust
if if i don't have somebody that and here's a fundamental like spiritual word i hear a lot
of times surrender there's no way you can surrender to this process if you don't have
somebody walking with you or it's difficult i can say it's very would be it would be incredibly
difficult for somebody to surrender to the process without having somebody to look toward and say
am i safe because egos inherently seek orientation and they can go a lot of places
if they at least know okay like i don't feel good this is not okay my body mind heart and
spirit is telling me i'm gonna die and then i should trust nobody right now
but i've surrendered to this and i can at least trust this person then i go through it like when
you work with trauma when you work with grief think about that like if you're grieving somebody
one of the things you most want is that person back right whether it's a relationship whether
it's a death whether it's a breakup or a death you want that person back and your your whole
existence is going to be trying to create that opportunity for them to be back and you have
to trust that what you're actually doing is saying goodbye and when you've loved and connected really
deeply with somebody and you have to say goodbye to them on this plane of existence when you're
even struggling with your own existence in this plane of existence that is a scary thing to say
the least so to trust is important in that space so i i mean i yeah go on let me let me
interrupt i'm sorry john rob what where does that sit with you what john just said yeah it's it's
it's right here you you've got to develop that trust instinctively first it's got it's got to
be the first thing i mean oh if we're talking from a initiation perspective then i've really
got to trust the person who's initiating me you're not going to get that far without without that
trust you've got to develop that trust and maybe i mean to a certain extent the doctor aspect plays
apart because you've got to see it and um you value a doctor more than you would do a plumber
you know if you've got a plumber initiating you then you wouldn't be so easy you you wouldn't
take the information on but if you if you've got a doctor john price talking to you then that that
makes a difference it's like it's a it's a certain level of it's not all authority but it's you know
john's had to go through quite a lot of education to get that title so you apply a certain
certain amount of it waits wait to your trust in him well i know that is he's very good at what
he does and his own field recognizing we have to give him his kudos would you would you let john
um john's talked about um trauma and i would say if we found out if we find out rob that trauma
can heal would you let john um starve you strip you naked and beat you probably not to be honest
no not and and quite frankly rob nor would i ever do that yeah yeah but if but but here's the kicker
though um and because here's where your language steps in and the way that i like to interpret some
of this i i i do for example want to starve you of previous behavioral and thought patterns that
used to serve you that we're learning very quickly are no longer serving you i would like to remind
you consistently when you go off of your path you know to maybe not to beat you to maybe i body
check you in a symbolic way that says hey you know i notice that you're going down this direction
let's talk about that what that means you know that to be naked most definitely but not literally
you know like we we talk a lot about the act of this you know of course vulnerability but
less than vulnerability i maybe not less than i think i think probably more than the word
vulnerability in all our various trappings with that word and all the associations but there's a
certain um desire for you as the patient let's just use this dynamic for a moment you the patient
to consistently work and be reminded to be authentic really true about with the energies that are in you
now that's that's different like what if the energies in you are rage what if the energies in
you are embarrassment and shame what if the energies in you are um you think that i'm judging
you in the moment and you feel agitated and like your your fantasy is you want to tell me to fuck off
well what if you and i've established enough a relationship for you to say i really want to
tell you to fuck off right now john and the way that i meet you is to say well why don't you rob
where does that come from help me understand let's draw that out a little bit let's let's pull this
part of you that's not able to be expressed because you can't do that in proper polite culture
but let's bring out that essence and so that we can look at it experientially as opposed to just
keeping it in some intellectual prison repressed and it comes out when you are driving down the
road and somebody cuts you off and you go into a fucking rage fit and you're beating on your steering
wheel because somebody just moved their car in front of you and it's like that's not about what
that's about that's about something else that you've been repressing or carrying and so
part of my vision of this work that first of all first of all has as a center point love
love and connection and when you can love and try to engender and bring out more of the individual
than they even know they're capable of because we love because we need love because we need connection
because we've been hurt in the areas where we need connection typically it's relational dynamics
that heal the wound trust begins for first step you're all you're talking about other I mean
expertise America needs you Dr. John Price America needs you right with no I mean literally they
do I mean you you treat the sick and in terrible terrible traumatic situations what if America needs
that you know that treatment that you're talking about going back to this mother and I mean can
you start can you start treating you know can you if Rob hangs out say Rob hangs out and
the wrong the wrong club and ends up flying symbols that are you know manifest his own
sociopathy can you treat can would you be treating Nazis in the future would you be
treating white nationalists will you be treating people who will stand against you as a as a
therapeuticion for lack of yes I mean the answer is absolutely because hurt people hurt people
and and now there is an element of somebody has to have had an experience that changes their
orientation because when they're stuck in an ideology they're they're living a life caught by
that thought pattern that's not that's not who they truly are that's a surrogate that's a so so it
reminds me of what I learned years ago like something like 80 percent of gang members are
fatherless and when we seek out those very masculine identified hierarchical structures
they tend to provide us what we need on a deep level but we find what we need because of what
we didn't get we find that's what we need because we didn't get it somewhere and so if we didn't
have healthy initiation into our own and now this is important it's not initiation into some kind of
institution it's initiation into your own inheritance as a human being into your own existence
into your own truth into your own authenticity and unfortunately systems and institutions are built
around that dynamic that tend to imagine that they have ownership of that process when they don't
this is a spiritual path that is outside of any time and space and certainly any institution
and what we need are people getting initiated into their own existence into their own reality
and what happens is we don't have healthy figures walking us along those rites of passage
that help us recognize our own cosmic inheritance in this in this plane of existence whatever it is
Rob do you hear do you hear Dr. Price talking directly to you this is Lucifer do you hear
Dr. Price talking directly to you yeah I hear the maxing on Apollo's temple which is know
thyself the first maxing yeah there's no thyself and I think that's that's that's
it's the first maxing for a reason what about your stain what about your stain rob what about
your stain do you have any particular stain that John is washing away in this process of rebirth
not yet no let me let me let me it's kind of unfair to expect John to gather all the information he
needs to assist me in what I just like go back to what you were saying about the whipping
and being naked yeah and going into that initiation and I'd certainly be glad it was John
I'd certainly be like oh I'm okay it's John I can trust John but are we talking about like
Laurel or are we talking about olive branches is that the kind of initiation because these kind of
things are what are reported from the ancient times aren't they I've been reading about them
over the past couple of days about incubations and the kind of processes you'd go through and
these are some of the processes and they have valid reasons for ethnogenic purposes
for some reason that they've come up with these processes of health and beneficial
means of going to an incubation and having a situation which you'd go to an incubation for
and these are the prescribed antidote to your problem is being whipped naked with an olive branch
or a Laurel branch which is just part of the initiation then you you'd go further into that
is that what you're referring to England when you when you when you're saying I'm stood there naked
and I'm being whipped with a Laurel but with branch or yeah I'm I'm talking about Villa the mysteries
brother I'm talking about that yeah I'm talking about somebody really getting it and Dionysus
being present I'm talking about the real cult that cult that reaches in and grabs the individual and
you would be comfortable this is interesting I find this fascinating thank you both for your time
I find it fascinating you you would let John strip you down and beat you at this point because you
trust him because you trust him right and I'm wondering if in that process John we can't do that
now right we can't John can't reach through the we can't replicate the circumstances but John right
now could hit upon John it's a kind of just quite it's very important point really that you you would
travel to the to the sanctuary you would travel there so when you would go in you would you I
don't know what you'd want somebody who you could who'd have a John's got a trustworthy face you could
say you're handing yourself over you're handing yourself over and you're withdrawing and you kind
of put yourself into John's hands because you want to receive some therapy that's that's the reason
why you're going and that's what you want to get out of it and the way John's going about it right
now is certainly yeah if we we wouldn't do it in this day and age but they were the practices in
that day and age so though those practices you wouldn't really expect any different we really
we've learned a lot but there's also a lot what we've lost within it we don't know really what is
inside or what why why they come up with these ideas for initiation why the whipping with the
branch why are you naked why you've got go into wondering why them situations are there do you
all serve a purpose each aspect of the initiation must serve a purpose otherwise you it'd be waste
and you'd you'd rid yourself of that waste while you're going through the process of
trying to help somebody with with certain type of therapy these days we we've got a completely
different way of going about it and that's we didn't always have did we you look at the early
psychology tests what they would have what they've done on human beings and
they've quit quite aggressive you know they have they have locked a gale in a room for years of a
life to only being fed food through a through a hole in the wall just to observe the lack of
socialization just to observe that that that was the whole this whole purpose of the experiment
was to see what results they got from that experiment so you know we're not that far out of this
I totally agree with that with whipping whipping people and the electrocuting people and we're
not that far out of it and we're on the cusp really of discovering that there is something more
and we're also discovering that that they knew more in the ancient times about aspects what we
what we are blinded in a certain respect so you'd say Rob you're a fan of
John's John's fortunate position of being at this kind of renaissance where where
he can rediscover those ancient techniques those that ancient physics we were talking
about before you came the quantum that you know they're saying now there's some sort of connection
between quantum physics and the human brain you know of course you know it's just the human
the brain in general um so yeah um yeah could you say something about that in the world that
we're living in in this apocalypse that I called it before you you you identify John as the healer
you can you can feel that you know that um would you be comfortable with physicians going back to
that knowledge and bringing that forward I mean you've you've read everything in the world nobody
can put anything past you Rob I know that and if if you're on a board of masons you're the leader
I know that for a fact so um for someone with such high standards and somebody who knows let's
face it you know honestly you've you've learned a little hypnosis you know a little bit of that um
tell me about embracing John's renaissance movement toward away from this away toward this
healing toward this healing that we could we could send the fascists and the evangelicals
some sort of assistance rather than turning this American experience into a giant civil war
yeah so you don't want the apocalypse or the giant civil war it's it's not easy to
to view these things and hear these things and actually have a conversation about these things
it's not it's not a pleasant situation um you do hear a lot quite a lot coming out of America now
from from this side of the pond and it's um it's troubling it really is troubling and I I really
haven't got the experience or knowledge base about evangelicals or even
any sort of right wing kind of entity because it's it's not something that's study it's not
something I've I choose to study that you know you've only got so much study time to study so
I'm going to dedicate that to something I enjoy studying rather than something I don't enjoy
I don't enjoy what I have had to give me time to it just of late and um it is worrying that
there's an a group of people that need treating by John's methods that for need the treatment
by John's method says volumes to me because John's methods aren't I can't really say as I'm
I watch John's podcast and and I and I really respect what John's work and these the
I don't know John personally with what I'm saying and I don't know all of John's qualifications but
what I do know of John is everything that comes across as organic organic and something that needs
to be a part of other people's lives I've said it's it's probably it's probably the best cast
kept secret amongst podcasts and it's a damn shame that people don't watch more of it because it's
got so much content there that we were talking about the initiation from the past but is it
Sean Sean Manu Manso yeah Manso and that guy's in the future is absolutely fantastic with
thinking about an initiation and making your own set and setting it was absolutely fun it was a
joy it was a joy to watch and listen to how we've done it because it resonated it resonated so
well with you know I've even thought there is there is need for music therapy
you know you could you could have a client come to you with a certain set of problems
and you could prescribe six or seven songs to go go home and listen to them and see what happens
you know given the right circumstances that could work and Sean's doing that to an extreme
I just thought it was fantastic it was it was something that is daring and it was beyond the
boundaries that was and that could be incorporated incorporated into the psychedelic experience
for all the people who are really looking for the psychedelic experience they're not looking for
they're looking for therapy in a therapeutic setting that's what I get from the psychedelic
community out there that's what they want they want a therapeutic setting they can get some
assistance and experience a different perception it's a different perception essentially that
you're looking for and once you get that different perception then it's yours to use and hold and
mold into whatever you want and you're not providing that in a correct manner in the
correct setting there's paramount it's absolute paramount it's it's a worry I have worries about
this the salesman and the marketing and and the use of the use of it to make money
because it's the complete opposite I found the same with Buddhism I'm afraid I wasn't christened
as as a child I wasn't christened so I took to finding a religion when the internet bloomed
and I kind of said I liked Buddhism and I self settled for Buddhism I liked Taoism really really
really really good read really made sense and resonated but then I went into
finding more about Buddhism and found as there was a lot was like a payment for retreat
and from what I'd gathered from Buddhism it was the polar opposite to what Buddha would
prescribe to he wouldn't he wouldn't be asking for money let's see it's not about this monetary
policy we of course money makes the world go around but
you know it's it's not it's not so essential essential is yeah well yeah we play the telephone
game with the like supercharged content you know like it you know somebody has a direct experience
and then that gets watered down and played out and it becomes rigid forms of structure
that we can apply as opposed to speaking back to relationship and fractals and part of Rob let's
use us as an example part of the nature of why the relationship is so effective is because you
as the subject of the experience and me as the object of this kind of healing
you know you hope right you hope that's a projection by the way I mean I'm a person you know but
in the nature with authority and with presence and with experience and with the words and
you can come in and you can share yourself and what will happen over time is you will introject
the dynamic subject object gets introjected so eventually I hear the voice of my healers
in my consciousness and eventually I become the voice of healing for my consciousness I told you
it was trying to possess you Rob I warned you you didn't listen very good no that's it no that's
it you're you're absolutely one of the members now you're born again and you're you're fresh in
that stream you see how you see how it works and that's that's what we're predicting for the future
will bring down this entire satanic operation the fact that there is some real physics in this
process and that John is not just a sham you know trying to make himself some money on the side
he is there in the trauma you guys couldn't you guys couldn't have brought this together more
beautifully I let me tell you both I'm so profoundly thankful for your time today and I I will end
I will end the show here so thank you for those of you who joined today this is the kind of content
that I would like to bring forward for you and I appreciate you and I appreciate your comments
I'm not selling you anything I have nothing to offer you besides my dedication and the dedication
of my guests to the muse thank you for coming thanks Rob
