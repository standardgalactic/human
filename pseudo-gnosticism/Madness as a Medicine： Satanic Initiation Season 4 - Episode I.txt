Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burned to my veins
Indian goes crazy and the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've gotcha sellin' and you got your drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah, drinkin' whiskey, oh yeah
Tonight on the season premiere of Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation
I have managed to secure for you an interview of an extraordinary, wonderful celebrity
I've brought it to you, I'm bringing it right to you tonight
We're going to be able to ask some hard hitting questions
Starting with round one tonight, we're going to move forward into that new discovery
That new Bronze Age discovery
And we're going to look at the specific drug, the compound, that's so important
It's going to lead us along the path of the mystery
Tonight, season four begins, Lady Babylon
Music
Tonight's subject of medicinal madness is brought to you by necessity in the present
We're going to look at these drugs, we're going to look at the combos that they're using
We're going to look at the people who are using them
We're going to ask why
And tonight we get to drop into a very sleepy place
A place where we can breach all of those bounds that we don't normally breach
We can bring forward in that religious ecstasy
We can bring forward that music
I think we have an example of some musical ecstasy
Can you hit it, Chewie?
Music
So, can we pull up the headline?
Yeah
This is just something to pull out of the present, right?
Something just to anchor us here
Yeah, woman has loud and full body orgasm during LA Philharmonic Concert
So, what is that old association?
Tonight, the reason that we have to come through this appearance of the orgasm
Or the orgasmos in Greek
Orge root, we're coming to the orgia
We're coming to the place where we bring out the bachic voice
Where we bring that out, right?
And in order to get there, we have to anchor ourselves with, you know, why?
Why are we doing this?
The drugs that were in that Bronze Age hair
That constellation of drugs are tangled within a right
That involves sexuality
It involves the individual coming to the point of what you and I would call the orgasm under the influence
And if that individual does not have within themselves that milk of calm
If they do not have that milk of calm, they won't be coming back
So, the knowledge here is fantastic
The capability of these Bronze Age priestesses pharmacologically is considerable
So tonight, I want to look at Mandrake
But before we do, I want to put everything within context
And the reason that we're here in Season 4 is we are hunting
We are hunting for the mystery
We are putting Jesus within the evidence
We're looking at the evidence of what we have
So that we can say, what was that naked kid doing with Jesus?
Now, I've been asking that question for several years
What was that naked kid doing with Jesus?
And I can tell you from the different types of responses that I've gotten from the academic community
By and large, overwhelmingly, it is fearful
People don't want to talk about it
So tonight, I thought we'd nail down Jesus and see what he thinks
Chewie, roll that
It's me, everybody's favorite Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ
And I just wanted to take a short break from my very busy schedule
You know, miracles, of course, have the really important Jesus duties up here
So that I could have a little divine intervention with you
Let's see, you've got a question for me here
Let's read it
I have just one very important question
What were you doing with that naked kid with whom you were arrested with at 4 a.m. in the public park?
Oh, yeah, you're referring to Mark 1451
I was sharing the gospel
Good word
I know what it looks like
Yeah, listen
Trust me, I was already canceled 2,000 years ago
I don't think I could be canceled again
It's alright
I love you
Stay blessed and try not to do anything I wouldn't do
Amen
Amen
I agree with 80% of you
He looks guilty, doesn't he? He looks really guilty
Credits
Credits to Jesus for answering
And for understanding
The cost of such things, of his ability to speak
Shouldn't be more than $40
Yeah, yeah
Thank you Jesus for your response
At least Jesus had the guts to stand there
And to look us in the eye and to give us an answer
The majority of people that you encounter that you ask them this question
What kind of answers will they give you? We're overheating here
What kind of answers will they give you?
Yeah, you'll be shocked at what you get
You'll see the person come right out
Come right out from that proposition
We don't care, do we? No
We are here because we want to get to the real
We want to get to the bottom
We don't care about what theories are
And I want to reemphasize that this season
We don't care what your theories are
We don't care what books you write
We don't care what classes you teach
We don't care what you're selling
We're here to find out what that crystal clear reality tastes like
Yeah, we're here for that spring
You guys are all devotees of the muse
We don't care that Harvard and Yale have dropped the ball
And Princeton has shot its own brains out
We don't care that they academically committed suicide
We don't care that Harvard and Yale and every other ivory tower association on the planet
Is scrambling to figure out where they went wrong
We don't care
Ours is the evidence, this is the museum
We have the sources, we have the texts
Let's jump into one tonight
This is our first, I just want to give you the first Greek text that I've got up here
Yes, beautiful, thank you, Chewie
Yeah, I'm just going to give you a little bit of diascordies
A little bit of diascordies
And this time I'm going to do it a little bit differently
I'm going to let you see the text, I'm going to flash it up here
And I'm going to tell you that we're going to be looking at Mandrake
We're going to be looking at Mandrake
And then I want to put the, go ahead and take the text down
And now I'm going to read it to you
For those of you who do such things, you pause it there
And you can go back over the Greek
But for those of you who say, I'm not into the Greek
But I want to hear what this has to say
For you, we'll take that down
I want to read to you about Mandrake
We call this planet, he says, the Cersean
The Cersean
And when he says that right away, we all run
To the folks at the university and we tell them
This is a compound, a polythonic compound
That is called by the name
That you can then piece together all of its component parts
To restore it, to make it one
It's the Cersean
The Cersean, okay, what is this Cersean thing?
This is what they're looking for in Spain
It's what they've got in their hair
It's what they've got in their hair
Okay, so let's look at one of the constituents of the Cersean compound
It is this Mandrake, the root of Mandrake
And when I say Cersean, I want you to remember
I want you to remember that we are talking about
Late Bronze Age monarchies
That are ruled by women who have extra-specialized knowledge
That knowledge is being used militarily
It's being used medicinally
And it is being used in a very destructive way
As well as a very positive way too
You could say it was their artificial intelligence
It was that burst, that fluorescence
There are people who are known to be the pioneers of these fields
You might be surprised to find out
But Pythagoras calls this combination
His oracular prophet
Give me some prophet
I need the prophet
Strangely enough, this prophet is a mantic prophet
And this prophet gives you the future
Through insanity, through lunacy, through mania
Now here's the thing, for those of you who need it
This drug can cure that violent, wrathful, fierce impulse
Yes, fantastic, that's how it's being used medically
That's how the doctors are apparently very good
Stabilize your brain
Yes, they're inducing a state
Let's see what else he says about this drug
You're going to be surprised
This is one of the Cercian elements
What do we know about this Cercian element?
Well, we know the Egyptians call it blah blah blah
We've got all these different regions
But Pythagoras calls the mandrake this
This little anthropomorph
Isn't that nice?
Throw up, give the mandrake up there
Let people see the creepy root
And notice that this old drug, this old drug
Even the Zoroastrians, he says
Call it this original or prime communion
This prime communion, the Romans have their names for it, right?
And some people call it the penis of Typhon
We know that the people that are involved have these baskets
Yes, these baskets with these dildos
And it only makes sense that this medicated dildo that we're using
To administer this drug
Remember guys, you're not in Kansas anymore
I forgot to tell you the ship, we're already there
You've got to realize that this is coming from the worship of the great mother
Who is actively involved in the sexual maturation
Of what you and I would call a child
Yes, so already we're in a foreign world
We're in a foreign world, we're going to have to get up
Sniff that air and we're going to say
Okay, this isn't what I want, right?
This isn't what I want, it's culturally this is
But it's there, so we're going to have to deal with it
We're going to have to see the right as it was in the real
Yes, good
So Pythagoras is steeped in the use of this
Mania-inducing drug, and remember it is only the
It is only the menads who end up bringing
You say what? Yeah, it turns out if you take this drug
It turns out if you take this drug
Diascortis tells you that it can put you into a place of
Where you're off onus
Yes, and what does that mean?
It means literally without a voice
It means literally without a voice
But it is word used of the tragic chorus
It is a dropping, a roughening, a harshening of the voice
Chemically, chemically
In other words, we're inducing a mania, a psychosis
We'll show you the drugs in a minute
But you're inducing a psychosis with these things
That involves a visionary state that is complete horror
And you say, why would you want to do that?
And they say, well, in antiquity the doctors say
Well, it helps with the aggression problem
Yeah, it helps with the aggression problem
You put somebody through this initiation
And you bring them out securely
It's part of their health
They didn't say mental health
But it's a way of casting out the demons
Fantastic, you can see the health is there
So here we are with the mandrake
And he says it's very useful
It's very useful, the root and its juice are very useful
In the filtron
I think I've got the Greek
Let's just go through some of these forms of the Greek up here
We'll start up here
This is the type of power that you're dealing with
The karotikos, isn't that nice?
The stupefying
And the karotikoi are a whole group of powers
Of drugs
Let's go to the next one
Whenever we're dealing with cereals
We've got to get into the cetaneus
Remember, take it down all of these drugs
And this is hard for us to understand
But they're using not one drug at a time
They're using compounds against other compounds
So multiple component drugs
That are the dote
And the antidote or the antifarmicon
Being these mixtures that are used to buffer
To maximize the potential
Without killing the patient
So they're under the influence of a lot of drugs
And you know they tweak it
With the more opium here
Have you seen how much thyscortis has on opium?
The surgeons are using mandrake
If they want to put you to sleep
To take something out of you
Or to cauterize, he says
They have to put you under the influence of the mandrake
It can knock you out for two to three hours
And their hours are like two and a half hours
And that's why he says the surgeons use them
The surgeons use them, right?
Good, good, good
But we have these states
What if we are missing?
What if we are missing something here?
And that we have failed
In our struggle for mental health
We failed to cast out our demons
Because we dropped the ball
We dropped the ball
We let the compounds
The knowledge of those compounds go
We let them go
And now we've got nothing on the receiving end
We know that these chemicals work in the brain
We know they do certain things
We know that when you enter death
The brain acts differently
Yes, yes, now
What do we know about inducing this state
In an individual
Through a polypharmaceutical process, right?
The only way we're going to get there is through the mandrake
It's through the actual evidence
Through the actual drugs that are used
This is fantastic
This is fantastic
The juice makes a filter
And what is a fieldtron?
I've got another
Just keep bringing me up to the Greek
Maybe it's one of these
There we go
Just click away at you
Is this the fieldtron?
Yes, it is
Look at here, people
Look at what we've got
Isn't this gorgeous?
Look at this fieldtron
You know what you use these things for?
You use these things to bring yourself to the moment
To the moment that you're able to understand
The past and the future
All at the present, right?
This is temple of Aphrodite stuff
Temple of Aphrodite stuff
And I just want you to notice that it can
Just mean the thing that causes love and affection
That thing that brings you there
So remember, when we're talking antiquity
We're talking the sexiness of the science
Is off the chart
All of it is complaining about
Oh man, I've been taking so many out for DZX
I can't get an erection anymore
What am I going to do for that?
So in order to exist in this society
Where they're using all of these drugs
In a very sophisticated way
You've got to have a college of priestesses
Please, those of you at the Bronze Age
To realize the level that we're working with here
It's just phenomenal, it's off the charts
The education here is off the charts
It's wonderful
I just want to make one quick note
From the text, right?
You'll get a lot of talk about
Well, you take so much
And you take even more, double that
And this kind of group of symptoms you'll get
You won't just get the mania, the psychosis
That's stage one, by the way
For all of you who are keeping track
With our drug cocktails
Yes, we're at stage one here, the mania
So you have to keep it at a certain level
You don't go off the edge
And thank goodness, there's guys like Nacandu
Who say, look, here's the antidotes
For when you catch these people out
And they're off the edge
And all they can do is make animal noises
Remember, where are we?
We're at the Late Bronze Age
If you're not careful, Cersei, Queen of the Etruscans
Is going to cut off your gonads
And give you drugs, anally, with a wand
And put you into a cage
Turn you into that eunuch servant, right?
Oh, God, turn you into that pig
Where do you think the Sibyls are coming from
In the Bronze Age?
Where do you think that tradition is coming from?
Sibyl is a Traskin word, man
That C is the word for gods
I didn't get that from anywhere
I got that from John Littis
You want to look up?
Oh, look up John Littis
See what he says about Sibyls
Love it, love it, I love this stuff
So here we are, we still got the Mandrake
And I still want you to see where are we doing
We're going into, oh, we're going into that manic
We're going into that manic stage
Okay, so what is the delirium
That is so beneficial medicinally
That we are bringing, right?
What is that?
Because that's the state that we want to get to
And we're only going to get there
With the proper balance of drugs
And the right sexual act
That's going to get us, somebody asked me
What's the purpose of all of the
Use of this drug, right?
That these guys like Pythagoras
And these oracles are flipping out on
What's the use of this kind of thing?
Is it just vision?
Is it just insight?
And I would have to say, I would have to say
You and I are sitting in a history of oracles
It doesn't matter what countries you're from
It doesn't matter what your peoples are
What your ethnicities are
It doesn't matter what your language is
We're still sitting within a history
That is a struggle for the mystery itself
For the performance of the mystery
To bring back that couple of Lady Babylon
Is the greatest danger to the Christian religion
Is the greatest danger to the followers of Moses
I'm not talking those Israelis
That are partying in the disco, right?
Who talk about the dotes
I'm not talking about those people
I'm talking about the Orthodox
I'm talking about the fundamentalists, right?
This greatest threat to their system
Is the control of the mystery
Is the control of the mystery
And what was this mystery that was operating
In the ancient world
What was the purpose?
Out of it, every time
Out of it comes the oracular capacity
To read the future and the past in the present
Now hang on a second
Before you jump and you're like
Oh, it's fortune telling, right?
It is fortune telling
But it's fortune telling on a scientific level
It's fortune telling via chemistry
And via music
Yeah, it's an accelerated form of learning
It's the Pythagorean root
It's the reason he's in the cave
Yes, it's a development
It's a development
Before Jesus and Mary ever got together
He had to cast seven demons out of her
Right?
So these states of mania that are associated with the soter
Right?
Were originally states of mania associated with the soter
With the soter
Yeah, throw me up these last
I need the devil said hurry up
Tonight we're going to have seven
At half past we're going to have an old boy
Who's going to bring us some new info from Britain
He's been running back in time for us
Go ahead and bring up which of these have we not seen
There we go
Yeah, I just want you to see here
Strich Struchnon
Right?
And look at three and four Struchnon monicon
And Struchnon hypnoticon
So you have very different, you know
The effects here mentally and diascortes
We'll mention these
So you have the regular sleep
And then you have the manic state
Right?
And some of the plants are better
Introducing that maniac state
That good mania
Right?
Okay, let's get another one
I just want you to see the whole school
To be mad from taking hembain
Right?
So when you're tripping
When you're tripping on this stuff
And you've got the purple stain
And they know you're one of those, right?
They'll probably call you the profaitin
They'll probably call you the galloid
Right?
You've got different names for them
These followers of Kotito
Don't you like that one?
Oh, that's a good one
This is what you've got on board
This is what you're doing
This is what you're doing to enter
Go ahead and put up Ezekius
I want people to see Ezekius
Look here, you know
This is to be crazy
Mania, apotis pos
From the communion drink, right?
From the potion itself, right?
There's a heart to the mandrake
Oh, Eve is always...
She's always right there, pertinent
There's a heart to the mandrake
And Diascorti says
You can give somebody that heart, that fruit
Right?
You can give somebody that fruit
And that fruit is the thing that opens the eyes
That fruit is the heightened awareness
Yeah, it is that thing which got us all kicked out of the garden
Yeah, right?
Now we have to have that painful childbirth
Don't be fooled
This all goes back to the childbirth
If you don't have a fetus somehow involved here
You're in the wrong place
If you aren't considering, seriously considering
Drinking fetal juice
Then you don't drink the blood and eat the flesh
Yes, you don't drink the blood and eat the flesh
With the mandrake, with the mandrake
We can follow, we can say, okay
We've got another group
Another group of drugs that are what...
I'm calling constellations
That's my own, I'm just trying to characterize what's going on
But we've got another constellation of drugs
That has a very specific role that you can see driven
Throughout the history from the earliest recorded Greek that we've got
From the earliest recorded Greek
When all we've got's the wanasa
All we've got's the wanasa
We have those drugs from the very beginning
And we have these women
And I just, I really wanted to stress
We are starting to see, because the Bronze Age archeology is flourishing right now
We're beginning to see different kind of society
That is this poison arrow horse culture
And we see that there are, surprise, surprise
There are women who are the generals
You know, the Chinese didn't like this in the Bronze Age
They had a very male driven and looked down upon female power
Yeah, because their problem was with those guys who were riding around
Whose women are the generals
Yeah, and who were fighting out in the front
Yeah, and their mobile horse troops
Yeah, the Greeks had to deal with these people too
Right, these were the amadzone
Or these were the masakitai
Yeah, these were the people who were there
These are the people who were there to use that poison in the arrow
So, mandrake tonight
Mandrake, we've got to root ourselves in the physical nature of what they were doing
Tonight's mandrake shows us that we can have families of drugs
That are meant to achieve certain effects in health
Certain effects in colt
We can have those families of drugs
And our last surprise tonight
We are looking for those of you who are interested in the more esoteric
I know a lot of people out there are talking about esoteric
But if you really want the esoteric
You want to know what rights were used by the Caesar's
You want to know what rights were the ruler's rights
And you want to follow those
Which we can
I can tell you what Augustus Caesar did in the privacy of his own bedroom
I can tell you that
I can tell you that why
Because that drug has left a fingerprint
And when I say drug, please people, please understand
I do not mean a single drug
I do not mean one thing
Please bring up those tropane alkaloids
Look at this, these are the drugs we're talking about people
Look at this, from our plants here, our family
Here's our mandrake
Here's our belladonna
Here's our detour
And look at the chemicals that we're getting
These all have that tropane ring
With that one nitrogen
Oh, this is gorgeous
And these...
Wait, cocaine?
Rights, rights
Now you're starting to get the Bacchic frenzy
This is not the place for the hippies
Right, hippies should not
Hippies don't, don't show up
Don't show up, don't show up singing songs
Don't
If you're going to
Participate in these rights
You're going to have to enter the darkness
You're going to have to enter that mania
You're going to have to worship
Malinawe
The goddess of black mania
Dark black
Putrid mania
These are the gods of death, man
This is Lhasa, stepping forward
This is the one who's going to smash your pumpkin with her
Giant sledgehammer
Right, this is the death and resurrection of the mystery
For those of you who call yourselves Christians
This is the mystery that you took up
After your master Jesus
Who was himself arrested in a public park
At 4 a.m. with a naked boy
Tonight we welcome his old boy here
Where's his old boy here?
Nope, he's not here
Your four minutes later
We're going to have to revoke the pay that he does not get
As we wait for Old Boy
Just to give us a little background on the Britons
Our interest is with the Puella
Is with the Puella who brings the miraculous cure
And here he is, here's Old Boy
Let me introduce you to the group
Old Boy is an intensive Greek student
And he has an interest in finding out things Britain
And tonight I just want to ask him
As an ignoramus, as somebody who does not study this field
It is not my field
But I like to dabble in it because we all can read, right?
Tell me something, do we have any overlap
Between these classical Bronze Age queens
Performing their magic and doing their sexual thing
Do we have any overlap between these
And, you know, are there Britons anywhere
That we can pull up rock and find these same people
Tell me about it
I've definitely, first of all, can you hear me okay?
Okay, so basically I've come at this from a point of view
Where I actually was looking into this history and mythology
And I started noticing these sort of themes
And then when I stumbled across your work
I noticed that there was these similarities
And that was kind of spurred me on to look into it deeper for Shewer
So as I've gone into some of the texts
And I'm looking at it through this lens of trying to
Well, just seeing it from everything that you've been sort of teaching
And showing in these past videos
And there's definitely more tips that are cropping up that are similar
So basically today the presentation that I've got
We've looked at some of the Irish mythology
It's actually taken us to the Irish mythology and to Maeve
So that's what we're going to be looking at today
Fantastic, do you want to just throw her out there?
I know that, let me ask this, I know that Maeve is the same person
M-E-D-B is the same person perhaps as M-A-B
What is it with the overlap of these princesses?
Can we keep these people straight or are they all becoming one?
Well, the linguistics definitely think there's some connection
Between the old Irish and the old Welsh
So Maeve, which is sometimes spelled M-E-D-B
Her name is assumed to be cognate with the Celtic Meadu
Which means Mead from the proto-Indo-European Meadu
Which is Mead or Honey
This is continued into the old Irish, Mead, the old Welsh, Mead
Modern-day Welsh, Mead, which is spelled M-E-D-D
And Breton, Meads, so Breton is kind of like the Brittany area
So this was a colony that left from Cornwall and set up in Brittany
So of post-Roman era
So you also get the adjective Mead-O-Wa
Which is derived from the noun and underlies the old Irish Maeve
Which is strong or intoxicating
And in the Welsh you get Meadu, which means drunk
And so you can see that this, see the thing that I like about the Welsh
Is that you can see the component word
So for example, Mead means the Mead
You have Meadu, which is intoxicated
There's a herbal remedy called Meadaglin
Which that's got quite a history to it
It seems to be a bit of a watered-down version of it these days
But when you're reading the old text it does seem to be more of like a herbal kind of remedy
And then the doctor's actually a Meadig
So you can see how the component has connotations associated with healing
And also intoxication
And that's where the crossover seems to be
Because Maeve's daughter, Findavar
Some people actually link that name with Gwynhavir
Because in the Welsh it's pronounced Gwynhuvir
So it's slightly different in the Welsh
In the old Welsh and the old Irish
There's this kind of connection which some people say exists
It makes me think that the Pulascian
They think maybe the proto-Indo-European was Pulascian or something
It makes me think that this overlap between
The Mycenaean Digama in Medwa
Versus Medea
Versus your Britons and Celts
Welsh, Irish, using this very same route
It makes me think that somehow that's older
And it's coming through
Linguistically it's coming through different branches
I wonder, do you think...
What do you think of the magic angle of all of this?
Because don't all of these women have magical powers?
Yeah for sure
So there's a few kind of areas that link from Maeve
So you have a goddess kind of aspect
You also have a sovereignty aspect
And you also just have the...
There's like a ruler and a healer
And all of the meetings that take place
The large meetings, they always occur in the mead hall as well
So that's kind of like her space
If she's the mead woman
Which is what they believe her name means
So this is where all the meetings take place in the mead hall
And with regards to the magic
There's definitely inclinations to that in the text
Especially as you have one...
There's one text which actually mentions that
Cuckullen's chariot rider
He actually, it says, has a mantle made of ravens feathers
Which was given to him by Simon Magus
And then there's these other kind of sections where...
Cuckullen, he's kind of like a hero figure
And he basically swatters everybody that he comes across
But he goes into these frenzes, these rages
And it often mentions this kind of...
An underlying meaning to the text you can tell
For example, if I find one
So one of the four tellings regarding Cuckullen
This is what it says
Fair of deeds, the man I see
Wounded sore is his fair skin
On his brow shines the hero's light
Victory's seat is in his face
Seven gems of champions brave
Deck the centre of his orbs, his eyes
Naked are the spears he bears
And he hooks a red cloak around
Noblest face is he I see
He respects all womankind
Young the lad and fresh his hue
With a dragon's form in fight
So that's just an example of how he's described
And there are actually a couple of sooths
So in the Feast of Breekrieu
You have three champions
And they're basically...
They're all in a competition to see who's the greatest champion
And it kind of escalates as the story goes along
And eventually they decide to go to Mavenaliel's castle
To see who can prove themselves to be worthy
Of the champion's portion
Which is kind of like a prize
So these three chariots
They're all racing towards the castle
And Maeve asks Findevar
To describe the chariot
And she says, I see another chariot's coming along the plane
Give us its description, Quothmive
I see in Sooth
So this is a Sooth sayer
Which is kind of almost like a prophecy
It's the kind of sea with a second sight
And basically she describes the horse coming
And then when you get onto the description of Cuckullen
This is what they have to say
In the chariot a sad melancholy man
Cummliest of the men of Errin
Around him a soft crimson pleasing tunic
Fastened across the breast where it stands open
With a salmon brooch of inlaid gold
Against which his bosom heaves beating in full strokes
And then it goes to describe in great detail his horses
And then it says
Set in each of his eyes eight red dragon gemstones
His two cheeks blue white and blood red
He emits sparks of fire and burning breath
With a ray of love in his look
A shower of pearls may thinketh have fallen into his mouth
Each of his two eyebrows as black as the side of a black spit
On his two thighs rests his golden hilted sword
And fastened to the copper frame of the chariot
Is his blood red spear
It goes on and just describes him
But you can basically, I can tell here that there's an underlying theme
There's a second meaning to this script in my opinion
And I can kind of see some of the images that I get from your work
And from what I've seen from your presentations
What do you think, Old Boy, about the prophetic side?
So you've got that tradition in Monmust's work
Of Merlin being that prophet, right?
Somehow he has stepped outside
And he's able to have this uncanny ability to understand the future
In the present
So he's always, he's beyond everybody's reach
That oracular power of the Sibyl is associated with specific drug co-ritual
So I guess what I'm asking is
Does this thing just thrive in nature?
Do we just have it coming over and over again?
Are we perpetuating a priesthood through time?
Or is this something that just spontaneously erupts?
How is Merlin that oracular prophet?
How has he captured that role?
So much so that the prophets, the prophets that Dioscorides are talking about
Are claiming that these are their base powers
These drugs are their base powers
So is Merlin, first of all, is Merlin a drug user?
And second of all, what's the real power of prophecy here?
And is it natural? Is it just coming up or is it some kind of, you know
Some kind of perpetuation of a priestly thing?
So in Geoffrey of Monmust's work
It's clearly seen as a really important aspect of the community as well I suppose
Because one of the kings is desperate to get Merlin back
He takes off into the woods
And Geoffrey of Monmouth himself is clearly familiar with the Greek classics
I've seen people describe his Vita Merlin
It's actually written in hexameter from what I've seen
And he mentions and cites quite a lot of these works
Such as Ovid, Epistles from Pontus, things like this
And he compares Merlin to Silenus to some degree in the life of Merlin
And he takes off into the woods
Because he doesn't want anything to do with money, people
He just wants to live in the woods with the animals and the trees and nature
And he's obsessed with his apple trees
So there's always mention of these apples
And actually Avalon, where Arthur later goes when he's wounded
That comes from the Avalon, comes from the word apple as well
It means the Isle of Apples
So there's always these mention of the apples as well
So I personally do believe that there was drug use going on
And there was an early writer called Camden, I believe, if memory serves
And he actually says that the Celtic Bellis or Bellinus comes from Hembein
Because the Welsh language, funnily enough, also kind of letters mutate
So the beginning of a word, the letter can change
A bit like in the Greek, you know, how it tunes the words when they run into each other
So they sound better
The Welsh kind of does the same
And a contraction of Bellin would be melin, which means yellow
So it's something to do with this yellow bright god
And obviously belting, the burning these big fires, the worshiping the god bell
So I think looking at the cultures as well
Where the scene is, you know, breathing in this fumigation and taking on the qualities of the deity
It seems to tick the boxes for me personally anyway
Yeah, nice, gorgeous, gorgeous
It always comes back to those apples of the disparities, doesn't it?
And it's almost as if nature has a state that you can discover
That you can go there and discover and that you have clues along the way
And it's putting it together and finding it
And all of a sudden when you found that, you get weird things like this great healer
Right, when you said Merlin takes Arthur there, right?
He takes him to be healed, right, to her
So I mean, there's a reason that Cersei kills Odysseus and brings him back to life
Right, and lycophron is the one who brings that in
So there's something about these
I've often wondered, oh boy, if it is not the case that through time
The Sibyl propagates herself
And that the Romans weren't as crazy as we thought they were
Because they said that very thing
Even the smarty Greeks with their Heraclitus
Understood the power of the propagation of the Sibyl
Was it a fact that she lived over a thousand years?
Was it a fact that she always appeared to be a teenager?
Was it a fact that she gave the laws that start our civilization?
And I mean us, modern, you know, on both sides of the pond
Right, that civilization, we are what we are because of these traditions
And these traditions, look at the Hinbein
These traditions are rooted in some advanced pharmacology
That holds great promise for medicine
If you can take a substance like scopolamine or atropine
And under the right circumstances
You can cause somebody to enter that maniac phase
And then bring them out of it
And they achieve some sort of re-circuiting
Re-organization, re-orientation of the brain
I don't know what it is, the neuro guys will figure it out
But yeah, there's something there
We can't overlook this
Oh boy, thank you for coming tonight
And I know that I will have much demand to bring you back
Please continue this research
I want to be creating a history for us here
Where we can see the movements of these things
I had somebody just ask me what happened
You know, when the symbols failed
When the flame died out
The Iraqi flame died out
And Christianity took over and oppressed that movement
Is that where we lost progress medically?
Is that where we slowed ourselves down?
Yeah, with this history nobody studies this stuff
But now that they found the Hinbein
Thank goodness they found Hinbein
Because I thought this wasn't going to be sexy at all
But now it's totally sexy
Filters, can I ask you one last question?
And then I'm going to go
I'll be at the meeting tonight on Lady Babylon
But I want to ask you this
What is the sex connection?
Everything you've been reading about
What have you gotten, just like a general sense of the sex connection?
Yeah, it's definitely there
Because if you look at Maeve herself
It looks like she had nine husbands
And you actually had to marry her to become the king
And the deal was sealed with an offer from a cup
From a chalice
And even in the texts, for example
She's not married to Cullen
But when he comes
She knows he's got this rage
So she does everything to placate him
They bring out thrice and fifty women
This is a number that crops up time and time again
Thrice and fifty
But she spends the night with him herself as well
Even though her husband's in the castle
So she's spending that time with him
And it says in the text as well
He gets the champions reward
Which is a drink from a chalice and wine
And she gives him a dragon stone as well
And it says the size of both of his eyes
And then I've been to a few of these old buildings
These old aristocratic houses just in England
And I have seen images of the man feeding from the breast as well
So, you know, there's people who are definitely trying to preserve this
Anyway, definitely
Yeah, and we didn't get there tonight
But in that...
Okay, so if we know that the sexuality is part
Part and parcel of the whole foundation of the rite
And the kings and the passing on of power
All that kind of stuff
It's all the way back to Georgia
Where we're talking about kingdoms
Yeah, definitely
Could it be?
I hate to keep pushing this because people don't
They don't want to talk about it
But could it be that they were doing...
They found something that they were doing something
Medically that was sexual and involved drugs
That's just because of our weird kind of perverted history
That we don't... we can't look at it for what it is
Is there any hope?
I'll ask, is there any hope for bringing back the sex rite
Without cracking the ceiling of the universe?
You know what I mean?
I think definitely there's a way to do it
I think it's down to understanding as well really
And I think you present that idea to somebody who hasn't got the context
And the background and probably you would seem quite abstract to them
But certainly when you're reading these mythologies and these texts
It just seems people didn't kind of bat an eyelid to that kind of thing
Co-Cullen's wife, she's letting him go off and do these types of things
So I think there's definitely scope
I think it's just getting a bit more of an understanding out there
To a wider audience
It's just a matter of time before we have fetal communion
Fetal communion that will enable us to fend off certain diseases
Enable us to live longer healthier lives
Maybe less inflammatory lives
Something anti-carcinogenic, you know
Something that gives us, you know, why did they hold up this serpent?
Why did they follow these traditions?
Why is this the thing that has been more influential?
We think that we're in a Judeo-Christian society
I hear people talk about that all the time
You can talk about monotheist society
You can talk about the West
But that still obscures the fact that our entire history is not about nations and peoples
It's about a right
And it's about the use of a right
The Jews, the Orthodox Jews and the Christians
The Fundamentalists, they know they have an instinct
Because it's baked into their own foundations
I love this
I love this
Let's bring Lady Babylon back
And oh boy, we'll do that
You and I will bring her back
How's that?
Let's make webs doing it, yeah
Alright, alright, thanks for coming tonight
Thanks to everybody for being here
And thanks to all boy who is our new star
Hail Satan
Hail Satan, thank you
Drinking whiskey
Oh yeah
