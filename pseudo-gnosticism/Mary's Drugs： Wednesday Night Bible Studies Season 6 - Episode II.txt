Sunday morning, dark clouds rising Oh there's no sunshine anywhere
Strong winds blowing, God give us wisdom To grasp the message in the air
Oh if I could have one wish And know that it would come true
Had a wish that God would give us strength To know just what to do
Then we could tear down the fences That fence is no longer
Fences created by such evil men Then we could tear down the fences
That fence is no longer Maybe we could walk together again
You're going to have to set aside your ethical, moral, cultural, personal difficulties
You're going to have to set all those aside I'm going to show you some texts
I'm going to take you a place that you haven't been and you may want to come back
You may get there and say the student is too much, it's too much
This is too much ancient great cult This is too much, just can't take it
No I know, I know that's not true, you're going to love it
Tonight on Lady Babylon
Good before we play our clip tonight to kind of purify the space, you know what I mean
We're going to be looking at just a couple of comments
It's nice they're going back and forth answering each other
You guys are geniuses, I know that and I appreciate your time
I see your comments and I really appreciate your time
Let's chew it, let's pull up that first one
Let's give our shout out to the people who are making the experience worthwhile
I've heard you speak, this is from Renee
Renee I've heard you speak highly of Medea but in the Argonauts she murdered her children
Is there a different version of her story?
And then strangely enough the next comment gave a great response to that
Thank you user, so and so
He answers this in one of the episodes and no she didn't actually kill her kids
Apparently there's a source, yeah take it down, thanks
Thank you for doing that, that's like you got my back, I appreciate that
There is indeed, there are several sources and one of them is Elian
If you want the controversy, you see it was Euripides
Who was being bribed by the Corinthians because this was Corinthian propaganda
We have a description of her, the monument that they set up
Once it was declared, right so let me step back
Elian, look at Elian for one of the sources that you'll be able to find this
But look what's going on, you're in Corinth and they've got a plague
And they're like what's the deal, send the embassy out to the Pythia, right?
Right always to the Pythia, this is the same priestess
Right this is the same group of oracles that dictate what goes on in the world
You and I wouldn't be sitting here knowing the name Socrates without them
Talk about empire, gorgeous the oracles, what do the oracles tell the Corinthians?
Hey you got a plague Bozos because you falsely claim that Medea killed her own children
When you know there was a mob of people
When she burned the palace down who cornered her kids
They cornered her kids, they beat them to death and then threw them into a well
And then to add impiety to their crime
They blamed Medea for having killed her own children
A smear of her personality, a smear it was
And the ancient source that we have is talking about
We all know the monument they're talking about because once the embassy got back with that
With that message they built a monument there at the site where they threw the bodies of her children
Said hey, mea culpa, mea culpa, right?
Many of you talk about Medea, we're not talking about myth
We're talking about Ligea, so I'm going to bring in Edgar Allen Poe
I'm going to bring in Edgar Allen Poe tonight, I don't want you to get into the place that you need to be in
Unless you come through those vapors of Edgar Allen Poe
I'm going to show you some dark stuff tonight, okay?
This is the good stuff, this is what you, you know, you got access to it tonight
Chewy, let's hit that video, cleanse the temple
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
What did Ed Poe know that we don't?
The name Ligea is an epithet of the muse
It means that clear or shrill voice, that piercing voice
Penetrates everything, that is Ligea
And if you really want to know
If you really have ears to hear
You will be able to read Ed Poe for the first time
Love it, love it, absolutely love it
Thank you Ed, thank you Ed
Say hello, say hello to Chuck
Fantastic, let's bring up these dirty, dirty texts
Okay, now what I'm bringing you tonight, we're going to start by summoning the prophet Ambakum
Come here Ambakum, you're one of my favorites
Here we go, we're going back to the Septuagint
And I want us, he's going to pop in here and he's going to tell you
Like it's a prophetic warning to those who have ears to hear
Hit it, Chewy, let's go right to Ambakum
Look at this, verse 15
Oh petit zone, oh you who are making your neighbor drunk
With that maddening outpouring of wine
Yes, yes, that maddening, bonkic outpour
Why are you doing it? Why are you cursed?
Ambakum, tell us, tell us Ambakum
You're doing it in order to uncover their what?
Spellaya, their grotto
The place where the lace tastes, does his business
Yes, yes, you shouldn't be doing it boys and girls
You shouldn't be going to the grotto
You shouldn't, it's bad news for you
Remember what that place is, show us the grotto
And the Greek here, yes, yes, no, no, one off
Yes, there we go, look at this people
Just take a look, quick, quick, at number two
Number two, look at the number two
And what do you get, the privy parts
For those of you who do not speak archaic English
Yeah, it's not quite archaic, but it's getting there
Those are the genitalia
Do you mean the cave is that sacred space?
Yeah, isn't that interesting?
Oh, we should have looked at it that way the whole time
You wouldn't be in this position, would you?
And yes, you'd have some satisfaction
Fantastic, let's go to the next, let's go to the next
Little bit of Greek, I just want to, thank you
Ambakum, go, take a dirt nap
Fantastic, I want to grab you now and I want to pull you
Using known us, I want to pull you into the Gospel of John
And you'll see why this makes sense
But I want to pull you into the Gospel of John
I want to warn you, this is dirty stuff, dirty stuff
Let's just look at it, you know
This Maria, he says, now what is this, by the way?
One more time, because I know we've said it a few times
People getting it, this is the paraphrase
Of John's Gospel, by the incredible scholar
Known us, 5th century, who's doing
Who's working with the most cult
Bacchic mystery, over 48 books
I mean, this guy's genius, right?
This guy has all that's hidden
Has all that esoteric stuff that we need
And he paraphrases it, he says
That esoteric stuff that we need
And he paraphrases, he rewrites John
He rewrites John, and when he does so
He exposes Jesus for what's going on
It's going to get graphic, it's going to get really graphic
But what's happening here? Maria, yeah
Mary, what's going on?
This is the Mary, which Mary are we talking about?
We're talking about the one who carries the goddess for Jesus
The one who carries the goddess for Jesus
Take a look at this Greek people
Theedokos, right? That's theedokos
It's an alternative
Most of what you're about to see is alternatives
Greek students, because he's got a fit meter
And these are typical things that Known us does
This work has got his fingerprints all over it
It's definitely, you could not have tried to imitate it
More closely
But he says, what's happening?
This is the Maria that is that one who bears the goddess
That beautiful haired one
And that is a title that we use in the mystery
That we use in the mystery
Who is she who bears the goddess?
I bet you want to know this, don't you?
Who is she who bears the goddess?
It's a title, a cult title
And Mary is given the cult title
Just like we had the Christos Wanaks
Yeah, yeah
Now, here we are
What is she doing for Jesus?
You're about to see her bring the goddess
You're about to see her bring the goddess
And look at the next line, what does she do?
She oils up his feet
She oils up both of his feet
With the do
With the what?
With the do
With the do
I want you to keep that little word in mind for a second
And I just want you to realize that
We're getting into a technical language now
Fantastic, with the do of what?
I'm expecting drugs
Do I see drugs? Of course I do
With respect to the do
Of the myrrh
The murron
That we are using in the
Sacrifices that fumigate us
To the seventh heaven
Fantastic, fantastic
So, don't be mistaken
Don't be mistaken, is there more?
I think there was more there in that one
Sorry to cut you off early on that one
Yeah, look at this last one
Yeah, and what does she do?
She wipes from his feet
She wipes from his feet
Yeah, with her hair
And this apo maso, what is it?
We have the Greek word, apo maso
I think we did, it should be the next
Should be the next one on the slide
Yep, very good, I think
Yeah, there we go, take a look at this people
Yeah, it means to wipe off
But look at number two
Look at number two
Your seminarians can be excused now
Because they don't have access to this
Your seminarians don't know this
Right, your Bible scholars
You people don't have access to this stuff
I'm giving it to you
Look at number two, to wipe clean
Especially in magic ceremonies
Especially in magic ceremonies
Look at the very last line of that
Of a serpent of that paragraph
Of a serpent, right?
To apo maso ton ion
We've all learned what that ios is
We know it's the poison, take it down
What is she, wait a minute
What's going on here?
What between Jesus and Mary?
What is going on?
I want to see it
I'm going to have to tune us in here
I'm going to have to turn up the resolution
I want to see it baby
I want to feel that stone, cold marble
The stone cold, what?
Yes, how do you think we get there?
Fantastic, next one
Let's go to the next one
I just want you to see that this is her beautiful hair
And I want you to notice
This way of describing a priestess is typical
Not only a priestess, but a goddess
A goddess, and look you can see
It's in the Orphic hymns
But who is the goddess that it talks about?
In the Orphic hymns
She is Bacchus
Because everybody knows
The savior has that beautiful hair
Right, she's the one who bears the goddess
Interestingly enough, interestingly enough
She's there for what?
I'm going to show you, it says in the Greek
What Jesus is doing to her
Who brings that power
She who is that
Bringer of the goddess
Let's see what she does to Jesus
And let's see what Jesus does to her
I want details, details
Fantastic, give me the next one
Yep
Oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, just, that's okay
Let's keep going to the next text
Boom, here we go, here we go
More, more, more of knownness
Right, what does she do?
Yeah, working from the top
She does what?
She moistened that hair of hers
Haite diabrochon
What is her, what is her hair?
It's slick, it's got that stuff in it
This is, she has come already
For this whole event
This is gorgeous, what you're about to see
I'm about to show you things
You didn't know Mary did
Okay, you will know
You will know
And what is she, again
She's the beautiful haired producer
Of the goddess, chalice of the goddess
For the Christ
Yes, for the Christ
And what does she put?
I want you to look at that first line
Iqmadi, Iqmadi
What did she put in her hair?
I didn't see that, I didn't see that
What is it? Iqmas
Iqmas is a body fluid
She put Jesus' body fluid
How are their body fluids involved at this point
With all of this drug terminology
Starting to get to me
Let's keep reading, she's going to do something
For those of you who are not adults in history
Those of you who aren't intellectual adults
You're going to want to leave the room
You're going to want to leave the room
Because we're going to look at a text
We're going to look at a text from antiquity
That is going to explain it
This is gorgeous, I love it
Okay, let's put that one up again
Yeah, oh, and okay
So while all of this is going on
Maria's brother, her sungunos
The person who's in the same clan
Her brother, poetic way of saying brother
And he is what kind of brother?
He's a barugunos
He's not too good on his feet
He's kind of weighed down
He's got heavy knees, right?
He's got heavy knees
And why does he got heavy knees?
Because he is Himaseto
He's struck
It's the idea, think about the person with the whip
The person with the whip, the mastic
Right, right
And when you apply that whip, that mastic
What happens to the person, go back to the text
Look where he is, look where he is
He's in a thermal atmoid
What?
He's in a hot vein
He's in a hot vapor
He's in a hot vapor
That is Nusalaos
Wait, what is Nusalaos?
Brings your vein
Yeah
It's a disease
You got in your flesh
Brings it out, those vapors
We know who invented this practice
That he is talking about
We'll call her Medea
Lovely, we're still not to the dirty part though
So where is this brother Lazarus?
He's out vaping
He's out vaping in the pirate grotto
Fantastic, we put a stone over his tomb
Place smelled terrible
Jesus was like, don't worry, he's not dead
And everybody's like, huh?
And he comes, roll away stone
Out he stumbles, right?
Yes, a perfect historical description
Of the drug sex cult machinations
Of those who wish to be born again
Yeah
You wondered why Jesus was hanging around
In the cemeteries all the time
You wondered
The one place he gets caught with the naked kid
You would think that we would put it together
Yeah, lovely, lovely
Let's go to that same source
We've lapped it up, we've got all of it
There's that bottom line, pull off that
Yep, yep, no, we got it
He's that container, baby
He's that container of the burn
Woo, you want to get resurrected?
You got to go, it was on that fourth day, right?
Why was it on that fourth day?
We knew Jesus got up and walked away
How did Lazarus get up and walk away?
They knew, they knew from the drugs
Exactly how long that death and resurrection
Would take place
All notice is doing is describing it to you
He's given away the secrets
And he's doing it in beautiful Greek
Beautiful Greek, let's go to the next text
Whatever we have after that, let's see
There's a couple things in here I wanted you to see
The atmos, notice that the atmos
You know, of incense, the vapors
Yeah, okay, okay
Going back to what Medea created
Good, give me another
When you get a chance, give me the next
The next entry after that one
Whatever it is, good
Pull down Bible studies, fantastic
Lazarus, who is Lazarus?
He's the one that Jesus philaeos
Uh oh, is the text pretty explicit?
Yeah, it is
It is, it even says
He's got that familial love for all three of them
But he's fancies, he fancies Lazarus
We'll leave that, that's hearsay
That's not going to hold it in transdimensional court
Right, people want to say
Yeah, look
No, come on
Come on, let's be adults
Right, we don't have any problem with patroclus
Right, we got over that
A couple of centuries ago
Patroclus and Achilles, they were lovers
Greeks were like, yeah, so
Right, there's no homosexuality
Until Christianity invents it
Up until that time with the Greeks
It's just one of those things, you know
Sex here, sex there
Polls, balance
Yeah, have a good life
Fantastic, let's go to the
Let's go to the
Back to that passage
Oh god, you're going to love it people
You're going to love it
Now having said that before
I just want to make a note
I have read some texts
From antiquity
That were very derogatory
So it's not like
Homosexuality hasn't been
A target, but no more so
Than every other type
And ethnicity
The point is that
Theality
Of homosexuality
Sets itself in western civilization
After the rise of Christianity
Correct? Fantastic
Love it
Let's go to this text, pull up that text
Okay, here it is people, I know
Thank you for waiting, 28 minutes
I'll try to get it quick
Yeah, he says, look at the end of this
Excuse me
Ithopinusoi
Ithopi, what is that?
It all sounds good, do you see the hallelujah?
What is he doing? The one that Jesus
Is particularly fond of
What is he doing? He's out hallelujahing
He's out what? Yeah
He's out hallelujahing
He's on drugs
Let me pull the text up again, he's got me on drugs
This doesn't make sense
Unless these people, are there drugs there?
Are there drugs there?
Ithopi, how's he doing it?
He's doing it within that flame
Is this a cold term? Yup
Yup, it is
You're kidding, no I'm not
He is in that bane of the fire
The fire's bane, that disease you get
Everybody here knows it
It's eros, you ever get the fire?
When you look and you see across the way
And you meet eyes, right?
Could be out in the middle of nowhere
But you hit, boom and you can feel the arrow
That arrow burns, in antiquity
That arrow burns you all the way to the marrow
And that's where your noda are
That's where your essence comes from
Huh, that fire is what he is in
He is in that burning, that flesh burns
Paul is, oh I just have a thorn in my flesh
You junkie, you junkie
You evangelicals follow junkies
Junkies
Are you ready? Let's do it
Give me the next Greek name
Yeah, this is fantastic, look at the end of the first line
So she says Koirane, and she uses this old title
For Jesus, to address Jesus
Koirane, why didn't you use the, you know, Curios
Isn't that, isn't that, well, what does the Koirane have?
It has an older sense to it
This is the master, this is the master
She says I know, right?
And I know that you're that one
Who is in this organization, in this world system
That we can't see, I know that you are the Christ
I know that you're the Logos
I know that you're the Son
And who is he the Son of?
Not just anybody, but of Alexi Kakoio Theu
Of the ill, or the poison of hurting
Zeus, this is who you are
You're the one who's the child of that God
Who averts ill, who averts poison
Who averts disaster
This is you
Yeah, all of a sudden, with those few titles
That we know exactly who we're talking about, Colt was
Gorgeous Jesus, just tell us one more dirty thing
That Mary's gonna do
Give us one more, I want you to see this
Next, yeah, go ahead, let's talk about Alexi Kakoio
There it is, keeping off that mischief, right?
Nice, notice that it's an epithet of Heracles
Does that surprise you?
It shouldn't, read the Orphic hymn to Heracles sometimes
You'll be like, oh, this is Jesus, right?
This is the Christ, this is the Morning Star
Love it, let's go, keep going to the next one
Okay, people, this is the dirty one
Is everybody, let's just take a second
And I'm gonna end on this
Just take it down for one second
I need to ramp up for this
I'm going to be as literal as I possibly can
I'm gonna give you the technical terms
In as easily accessible and vivid way as I possibly can
I'm gonna try to paint for you the picture
Of what this amazing author is saying about Jesus
Okay, let's bring it up, let's bring it up
Hail Satan, let's do this
Are you ready?
I'm just gonna translate for you
And then I'm gonna go back and point out some words
Yeah, so Mary took up that Muron that we use in the rites
And this stuff was pure
She took, blow it up, she took, there we go
She took three measures of this stuff from the Nard
And what does she do?
She did what?
She engaged her Marmaron, her marble
She engaged the marble, you know what I mean?
Right?
She lifted back and forth the marble
I'm not kidding you, it's what it says
But it's gonna describe to you what kind of marble it is
It's Bebus Manon marble
It's the kind, are you ready?
It's the kind with which you plug the gaps
You put it in the holes, you plug the gaps
This is the marble that fills the hole
Yeah, and what does it do?
What does it do?
It's that vessel for the do
It's that vessel for the what?
For the do, there's our do again
There's our do again
Do you know who produces do?
If you do not know who produces do
You are not a devotee of the rites that keep this world going round and round and round
Yes, if you do know how the do is brought
And what is done with the do
You've been initiated, you're born again
You see it
This is an alabasteran
I want you to notice it can both contain fluid
And be used as a medical applicator
For which Aristophanes made fun of it
Yes, it is an ancient dildo
And that's the precise terminology
This history that we're doing contains the dildos
And the use of those dildos
Yeah, the marble
Now in antiquity dildos were made of several materials
Dildos were made of leather
The actors on the stage employed large leather dildos
They were made of polished stone
The marble is particularly user-friendly
When it comes to the applications of drugs to the rectum in antiquity
This is history about Jesus
Yeah
Remember the naked boy that was with Jesus when he got arrested
Let's keep putting this in the context that we can
If he and Mary are openly engaged in a mystery that involves drugs and sex
Well, let's see, what's she do?
What's she do with the whole plugging marble?
Let's see
That's her alabastern, by the way
That's a reference
The other Gospels talk about her alabastern, right?
Fantastic
So she takes this thing, this whole plugging thing
That becomes the carrier of the do
And she is that Eucomos
That one whose hair has been positioned for the sake of the performance of rights
Yes, yes
Love this, love this
And what does she do?
Oh, my goodness
Okay, here's where it gets a little bit rough
Here's where it gets a little bit rough
Elabe says so
She's gonna oil up the feet
He doesn't just say the feet of Jesus
He says the feet that are Thespacios
Those are the feet that are divine
Jesus' feet are oracular
What?
What?
Thespacios is up there, give me
I just want people to believe me
Right, where's the...
Look, it's not me, give me another of the Greek
I think it's that one, Thespacios
Let's see, no, that's not it
Let's go out, is it this one?
Nope, let's send it one more
That's the eating
No, oh darn it, we'll come across it later
Yeah, the eating, I'm sorry
Don't spoil your dinner but
Here we go, are you ready?
Bring the text up, let's just give it to them
Okay, here we go, I'm just gonna translate the whole thing
Okay, so
Mary took up that marble
That is used for plugging holes, right
And carrying the dew
And she did what?
She anointed, massaged
Applied the oil, right
To the feet, those oracular
Those oracular feet
Those prophetic feet
That future telling feet thing
And what does she do?
She anointed those that belong
To her dino minu basileus
Her what?
Her king, her king who is what?
Dino minu
Her king
Who is eating her
Her king who is consuming the communion
Her king who is the Christed one
Why do you think Mary had to be?
Had to be that one who brings
The God S
The A
Yeah, the God S
Not the Thos
Yes
How did she have to bring that?
He has to be consuming her
He has to be consuming her
Yes, and if you look up
If you look it up, you'll see that
It's used with respect to specific drugs
And what specific drugs are there?
Oh, well, it's the Eos
Are you surprised?
No, you shouldn't be
This is a circus where we can track the drugs perfectly
We always know what's going on if we're watching the drugs
And what is she doing?
She is producing this drug
She is producing it
She brings the dew
She brings the dew
Okay, so bring it up again
Let's see that last
Okay, and what happens?
Well, it's an orgy, people
So ultimately everybody is going to get involved
Right, look at what she's doing
Now you know why Gregory pardoned her
Right, for using, if this is the same one
For using the sex drugs
Gregory was talking about it
Anyway, so on the next line
What does it say?
Hectadye
Yeah, look at the next line
15 Ichmada, what is she doing?
She's harvesting that Ichmada
Spread wide
Hectadye
And what kind of Ichmada is it?
It's pialein
What is pialein?
You know that
Some fluids can be clear like water
Can behave like water
Some fluids from antiquity
We're talking like the docs did in antiquity
And some fluids can be sticky
They can stick together
So as Galen says, you can take your finger
And you can take the fluid
And you can stretch your fingers
And the fluid makes a little string
Because it's viscous
Yeah, it's kind of thick
Kind of like flim
Yes, right
Right, well we've got that here
We've got that here
In Mary's hair
Right, and she is spread out all over
Hmm, interesting
Okay, I'm trying to get a picture
Let's bring the verse back
Get exactly what it is
Yeah, and where is it going?
It's going into her magladi
Hitei
And for those of you who think this is not dirty
I want to take you to the maglos
Hitei is her hair
She's known for this hair of the priestess
You know what's in the hair of the priestesses?
The drugs and the sacred body fluids
What?
Yes, the drugs and the communion
The drugs and the communion
It's in the hair
It's not just in their regular hair
Right, it's in there
Show me the text again
It's in this type of hair
Look at that last line
Magladi on the second to last line
Give me the Greek from the next
And it'll give us a little trail here
No, this is by the way
This is what Jesus is consuming
This is what Jesus is doing
And I just wanted you to see
They do it of poisons as well
To feast on
What is Jesus doing to Mary?
He's feasting on her
Right?
He's feasting on her
Unless you eat my flesh
And drink my blood
You got no place in the kingdom
Some people are born eunuchs
And some are made eunuchs for the kingdom
You got no place with me
Unless you eat my flesh
You know what he's doing to her?
He is eating her flesh
In that flesh
In Greek
In that flesh
Is that water of life
And there's only one way to get there
And Paul is tired of doing it
He doesn't want to do it anymore
Thorn in my flesh
Oh, God
You didn't know they were so creepy, did you?
It's the drugs, man
You just trace down the...
Look at the drugs they're using
Fantastic
Let's go back to it
One more
Here's a little tiny bit of dirtiness left
For those...
Oh, mochlos
We still didn't get to the mochlos
Keep going
Just so people can see it
Machladi here is what we've got in the text
The next Greek
Probably right there
No, this is what's going on
Methusco
People are getting inebriated
People are getting intoxicated
Getting intoxicated
Next one
Fantastic
Oh, God
Fantastic
Oh, here's from before
That awful and natural
That oracular
That madness that this stuff gets us into
Love it
Next one
Next one
Here's the mochlos, right?
Look at it
Oh, my goodness
What is it?
Wanton
Wanton or luxuriant
The next one gives a little bit more definition
Here we go
Lude or lustful of women
You women out there
This is only for you
You mean the Greeks have a word
That just expresses the wantonness
The luxuriant wantonness
Of a woman
Yeah
Because you don't have it, dude
You don't have it
Some eunuchs are made eunuchs
For the kingdom of heaven
You want that attraction?
Yeah
When you're in a cult
There's only one doorway
And it's right here
With that mochlos
That's how her hair is described
In which she is receiving
She is receiving what?
The ikmas
She is receiving Jesus' body fluid
Of communion
Love it
They used to call it haima
Blood
They used to call semen
From both men and women
Blood
It's the essence
Love it
Let's go down
We've got a couple more slides
And we're done
This is fantastic
We're right here at the climax
What kind of...
By the way, this is all stuff to drink
That PLAos that I told you
We were translating before
Notice that it's used of drinks
And notice for my Greek students
Nikander
Look at that bottom source
Aposis is a potion
It's for peon
For drinking
And it gives us the Hippocratic diseases of women
Notice that bottom source is Nikander
Nikander
As soon as you get Nikander
You know where you are
You know what kind of terms are being used
And he's a priest
He's a priest of these resurrection rites
He's a healer
Right?
Apollo
Love it
Love it
Let's go to the next one
Yeah
That's okay
That's not a big deal
And then finally
Finally on the bottom
I wanted you guys to see this
Just blow this up for me, Chewie
What is happening to everybody else?
Says the Bible
Right?
Says knownness
What's happening?
They're spreading it
It's not just happening to Jesus
He's not just laying there with Mary
Right?
Exchanging body fluids
Feasting on Mary
He's not just
He's not just doing that
Everybody else gets in on it
And how are they getting in on it?
They're being
Steeped
In
The
Vapors
They're being made drunk
With the vapers
And I just want to bring up that last Greek slide
Chewie, the last Greek text that we did
Look at the very last line
Nechomene
What is she doing?
What's Mary doing?
You can see her on the floor
Right?
And what is she doing?
Spread over Jesus?
And what is she doing with her marble?
She is swimming
She's what?
She is swimming
In the fumes
Of this in-theotic drug
This drug that puts the God inside of you
This place is made
It says on the bottom line in Methodism
It made the whole household
Made the whole household
Stoned
It intoxicated
Do you remember Medea intoxicating people
Against their will with the fumigations?
That is exactly what is going on here
Do we know what happened to the rest of the disciples
That were with them?
Who became intoxicated?
We do not
But I can tell you this for a fact
A satyr is a satyr
And a satyr will just as soon
Enter into coitus
With another satyr
As they will anyone else
Yeah
Interesting
Those are real rights
Those are orgia
That's that orgia
Yeah
That's the real thing
It's quite a picture
It's quite a picture
And I'm afraid
Following Mary's pardon
For the sex drugs
I'm afraid
This went downhill
Yeah
It went downhill
Now we're going to watch that
We're going to track that
Because when we bring the case to court
To trans-dimensional court
And we've got Jesus
And we've got his naked boy from Mark 14, 51, 52
We have everything built up with his child trafficking
And the drugs that they're using
I want these drugs as evidence
That Muron, that Nardon
I want those things there
I want the Ich Mada
The Ich Mas
I want that on display
When Jesus is sitting in the witness stand
Because you know
He's going to go ahead and try to take it
He's going to be dumb enough to think he can take the witness stand
You know when we hold up
That body fluid from
Dude, genetic test is genetic test, right?
Evidence is evidence
Is this your bodily fluids, Jesus
And the hair of Mary
Is this your bodily fluid
Is this your dew
Did you, Jesus Christ
Sit there with Mary
With a marble alabaster
That is built to drug you
By plugging your portals
Jesus
Was Mary using it on Jesus
It's the sex drug
That is covered
On the medicated dildo
That would be inducing him
To have that death and resurrection
You know, what is she doing?
She's foretelling my death
Yeah, right?
Oh, now I see
I wish I'd have known all the dirty details
In the meantime
And I would not have devoted time
To the worship of this duo
Yeah, corruption of the rights, people
Corruption of the rights
Let's not let one bad egg
Arrested with a naked kid
Let's not let him taint
Our classical heritage
Let's get the text back
And let's tell the story
Let him see him
The answer is not apologetics
The answer is letting them see Jesus
Hail Satan
We could walk together again
Just maybe we could walk together again
