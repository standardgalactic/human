Welcome back to Lady Babylon, this is Better Than Muse, and I have two things for you people tonight,
you blessed congregation of Satan, I've got two things for you. Number one, I'm going to take you to a dirty, dirty, dank, dark place.
We're going to go there with Jesus Christ, we're going to see what he does, this is body cam of the dead,
you're going to love it, you're going to love it, and then after that, we are going to have a candid talk,
and I'm going to make some announcements and talk about progressing this week and where we go,
as you know, fantastic, fantastic, there is a resurgence in the interest in ancient Greek,
people are wanting to go there, they're wanting to break out of that brain that's been set by some terrible,
terrible, bog marching language, something that's gorgeous, something that has the power of the art.
Yeah, that's what people, I've got hundreds of applications and we will talk about that part two tonight,
but I really wanted to give you something big tonight, and I wanted to start by saying just a shout out,
a shout out to the here, where's the, yep, there we go, a shout out to the artists of the French Republic,
a shout out to you for preserving a society that is not controlled by religion, fantastic, fantastic,
American thing, people, now don't you get nasty, you be quiet, we're talking about text tonight,
that's where we're going and you must be good, because I am going to show you something that is going to make you wretch.
This episode is dedicated to the Oklahoma educators, those of you who will now be teaching the Bible,
this is dedicated to you, the first place we should take them, you know, you know the first place we should take them,
the first place you take that fourth grade student, you say come here Tommy, come here Tommy, come here Tommy,
you want to hear about Jesus Tommy, tell him, tell him the blessed words of God, Mark 1451 and 52,
tell them about the arrest, teach them the Bible, it's very important, now tonight I'm going to take you in,
I'm going to take you into a place, by the way, Europe, sorry you caught it too, we're just a little bit ahead,
we gave it to Canada too, everybody said, don't sleep with America, they all said it, next thing you know,
we're all getting antibiotics, yeah this one happens to be drug resistant, sorry you got it, nice job,
England, nice job, I see you're, I see you're, everybody's staring at the protest like, huh?
It's fantastic, now how do we, how do we maintain the course, because you know what we're here for,
we're here for the muse, are you ready, I'm going to, all of that was just to get the ship to go to the place
that we needed to go, everybody off, what I'm taking you to tonight, is going to be the most horrific,
horrific mystery right with Jesus Christ, with Jesus Christ, and for those of you who call yourselves Christians,
Naughty, naughty, you know what, did you see the Olympic Committee apologizing, did you see them apologizing,
why would you do that, you just gave them immunity, you just gave them immunity, why did you do that,
you should have been saying, we don't need your apology, do you understand what the muse did when she set up free speech,
do you understand, she's going to prevent you from having any kind of monist takeover, monist takeover,
wait, before we're even getting into the Bible, people are saying, oh, oh, for the people who sent me messages
and said, oh, I think I get it now, thank you for sticking in there, I appreciate it, I appreciate it, right,
for those of you who doubt the monist fervor and the overthrow of the American Democratic Republic,
feast your eyes on this, bring him up, bring him up, make him talk, yeah, make him talk.
And again, Christians get out and vote just this time, you won't have to do it anymore,
four more years, you know what, it'll be fixed, it'll be fine, you won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians,
I love you Christians, I'm Matt Christian, I love you, get out, you got to get out and vote,
in four years you don't have to vote again, we'll have it fixed so good, you're not going to have to vote.
This election is a joke with Lucifer, he thinks it's hilarious, and it makes us look bad,
I got to tell you that representing in front of Lucifer makes us look bad,
makes us look like we can't read history, do you think this election is going to count for anything?
No, the Christians will sweep their God into power, yes, they'll sweep him in,
and you will be teaching the Bible, now let's get there, let's go to the Bible, let's see the actual mystery right,
but in order to begin, look, people, I love this, we've been having discussions between YouTubers about Greek,
and here's where it picked up last time, get that first one up there, bring that first one up there,
Neil, you're right, Caesa is in a passive sense, burnt, as you said, in the energetic sense of burning purple,
it should have been Causa, so you should have a burnt porfura to do the actual job,
now the conclusion is wrong, based on experience and skill, the person is right, there's a difference between that passive and active form,
they're right about that, but as someone, now I would stop there and say, okay, this person is great, you've jumped into the ring,
but I can tell by your style that you haven't been wrestling for long, okay, I can tell, you've got a little bit of the tool,
but if you had read, if you had been pounding those exercises and reading and reading and reading,
everybody that you could come across, you'd realize that's not what the problem is, the burning purple is exactly as I translated it,
burning purple, because the word, give me the next one, the word kyo is used as a perfect to mean in kindle or kindle to burn,
and it's used, how do I know that, because I've read it, I've read it, come here, come here seminarians,
take them down, did you get it, check this out when you've got more time, check out how the passive is used,
and it's used a lot with love, the person who is in love burns, the person who is in love burns,
the por fura that purple is being used to affect mental state, and I'm going to show you the Greek in just a second,
so you'll see it when we're in this drug party, mystery cult, right, get your terms right, go back, give me the next one,
okay, so where are we going to start, we're going to start with the Bible, right, and I just want you to see where we've come,
where have we come, we've come to the cemetery with tombs people, do you see all the tombs, around why,
because this is the place that Jesus and his crew get down to business, this is where they do it, are you ready,
and what happens, we see a scene here of a bunch of women who went to a tomb and came running out in ecstasy,
and tromos, you know what tromos is, that's a shaking man, you've got to get really messed up,
you've got to, I'm terrified, I'm terrified, what's going on, did you see that, what was it, terrified these cultists, right,
okay, let's go a little bit deeper, see what kind of drugs they're using, that was the Gospel of Mark by the way,
give me the next one, Mary Magdalene was in there, what are these people in, they're in ecstasy people, this is the Bible,
look at that last word ecstasy, that's what the people are in, Mary is in it, why, has to do with little boy,
has to do with little boy and tomb, can you believe that, let's see what happens next, let's see what happens next,
excuse me, Chewie you're going to have to keep up with this, people are going to start getting, you're not going to believe this,
but just look at the text that I'm giving you, okay, this is Mark 16-6, yeah, he says to them, so they're going into the tomb,
right, and there's a kid there, they're going into the tomb and there's a kid there, where Jesus was,
and he says, you're looking for Jesus, right, from Nazareth, he is awake, he is awake, and he got up and walked out of here,
he walked out of here, wait a minute, Jesus Christ, the dude that was just crucified, yes that's what he says,
the crucified dude, he got up and he walked away, the word that he's using is a ghetto, he's going to be using that all the time,
he's not here, he's not here, he did what, what does that mean to a ghetto, what does it mean, it means to revive,
he revived Jesus Christ with the stars in his hand, he revived, he revived after that crucifixion,
do you remember where we were Jesus when you first offered me drugs, do you remember Jesus Christ where we were,
Oklahoma teachers, catch this one, do you remember where we were Jesus Christ when you first offered me drugs,
I remember you said something about a snake and then you said you were going to give me death inducers but it wouldn't hurt me,
do you remember, what was Jesus Christ doing on that cross, he was dying, he was dying,
and did you see, he yelled something out and then plonk, he was dead and the Roman guards were like dude, he's too early,
he's already dead, we can't even break his legs, here poke him, they poked him with the spear, do you know I have read Galen,
people, congregation, trust me, repairing a wound from a sword, a spear, a dagger, they've got it all, right,
those are surgeries that they're performing all the time, do they have such a high success rate as us, probably not, probably not,
but Galen has all sorts of stuff but I had to clean out wounds from arrows, from spears, how to suture them, using some kind of thing like cat gut,
yeah, it's fantastic, incredible, incredible, and so wait a minute, you mean Jesus who they took off the cross,
when he entered that death, you mean there are people who are saying that the dude got off and walked away and who's saying it,
a young boy, do you want to see what we do with young boys, if we are Christians, do you want to see, let's show them,
let's show them Chewie, teach the Bible to these people, where's the next one, is that it, yeah, here's Mark 16-5,
so here comes Jesus, here he comes, as you see him, we're still at the tombs, right, we see this little kid there,
we saw these women run out and they are totally baked, right, totally baked, seeing stuff, running, what happens,
we're standing there and here comes Jesus, it's like we're part of the movie, here comes Jesus and he walks in and he sees this little kid,
sitting there, where's this Jesus, I forget who the hell was this again, somebody, okay, somebody is seeing,
it doesn't say somebody is seeing this name, and he's sitting there, oh it's probably Mary and her group,
he's sitting there on the right hand of where that Jesus was and he's dressed in a stole, a leuke, he's dressed in a what,
he's dressed in a white stole, which is what you give to initiates, so what you give to initiates, what kind of initiates,
initiates who are doing night operations right before dawn in cemeteries, night operations and cemeteries using the burning purple,
death inducing operations from which you bring the person back, yeah, Jesus is doing it all the time,
if you haven't you ever wonder why Jesus is walking through town and somebody is like, oh we've got somebody,
you need to come see this girl, it's like waking her up, she's not dead, don't worry, that's not fairy tale, that's cult,
it's ancient cult dude, and don't touch his robes, don't touch that dude's robes, he's a magus and you know what happens,
he gets that stuff on his robes dude, that's poison, why do you think the madusa, we're putting it in their hair,
why do you think the madusa, we're putting it in their hair, it's the bow poison, fantastic, it's the burning purple,
if you had had it, you would understand why it's the burning purple, do you understand me, it's going to take you there,
give me the next one, give me the next one, okay so here's Mary and her group, what is this ekthambos by the way,
this is what Mary's group is described as being, these are people who are out of what, are they out of their mind,
they're amazed, they're astounded, look at the sources that we're getting it from, at the end of that first line,
the tab defix, the tablet defixiones, the tablets that are the cursed tablets, what else, the orphic fragments,
do you see this mystery coming out, this is square up bronze age orphic mystery, this is the birth of the magi,
magi I didn't come out of Persia, huha buha Persia, come here Persia, you Persia, you thought you were the best,
long time, when the Persians were nothing, right, a group called the Aryans changed their identity to match their queen Medea,
yeah, she was that bronze age Medwa, right or Medwanasa, that Medrute, right, always goes back to that bronze age judge,
oh god, it's gorgeous, it's gorgeous, okay, okay give me the next one, I gotta get to the really hot stuff, right,
people who love the Bible, right, you lift up the serpents and what, you'll take that Thanassimon,
you'll take that, look it's got two accents, isn't that cute, little in clinic follows it, what, Thanassimon,
what is that, that's that drug that Jesus just gave you, chill out, okay, you mean, I'm gonna show you tonight,
that there are Christian rites that are held within the inner circles of Christianity, yeah, we intercepted a letter from one Christian to another,
talking about it, it's fantastic, it's perfect, it's great intelligence, this is your future, don't think of it so much as your past,
I think it was your immediate future, oh I love it, give it to me, give it to me, we're going back, this is gonna be fantastic,
I'm telling, I'm ratting out the entire congregation, those Satanists, they pushed me to do this, they offered me,
they offered me, you know, clapping and applause, give me the next one, what are we looking for people,
we're looking for people who can cast out Daimonia, do you have any demons, they're, now let me explain this to you,
they're all in the air around you, right, they're all in the air around you, and they can affect you,
and you can be changed by forces, we'll call them, I don't know, winds, winds that will blow those demons, okay, good,
alright, give me the next one, that's what we're doing, we're juggling these forces, remember Jesus takes seven of these out of Mary,
remember the episode where he self-pleasures and makes her eat it as the bread of his body, right, that's the kind, we're in that cold,
now we're gonna watch Jesus, a lot of you are like show me Jesus actually doing this stuff, tonight I'm gonna do it,
and by the way, I do want to say, I do want to say, the devil told me not to forget this, Jesus Christ came out vocally in support of transgender surgery,
yeah, he did, he came out in support of it, I'm gonna quote the verse, this is another one, teachers of Oklahoma,
make sure that you give people this Bible verse so they can see that Jesus was right in on the transgender thing,
he was right in, now if you're Elon Musk and you're confused right now, it's okay, they're doing the same thing in antiquity,
they're using hormones from animal products and plant products, and they're performing surgeries, it's a very common Elon,
it's called castration, it's called castration and the he becomes the she, and they have no problem, could tell us it's like he,
the night before and she the next day, right, there's no, this is not, this is not contrary to Jesus Christ,
Jesus Christ, I'm gonna show you where he talks about transgender surgery, love it, love it, show us Jesus, right, okay here we go,
Revelation 220, oh let's go somewhere dark really quick, look people, I'm the Lord and I'm telling you, I got a beef and my beef is this woman,
Yezabel and who is she, she's working with your dudes, with my followers and what is she doing, you know what she's doing,
she's prophesying and she's causing people to become wanderers, slaves to the porneosa, slaves to the act of sexuality,
carried out in a temple context, she is causing people to be addicted to eating the stuff that goes to the gods,
okay wait a minute, how do I get there first of all, is there an Uber that will take me to this place where she is, I want to know,
it is her communion, it is the mystery that they are still performing, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ is right in the middle of it, right in the middle of it,
oh God, let's show him, right, let's show him, give me the next one, it's supposed to give you a panorama, right, Matthew 1912, what happens,
oh God, people, are you ready, some people says Jesus Christ, remember all the stuff about love your neighbor,
and all that stuff, you maggots love it, don't you, love your neighbor, pow pow pow, right, love your neighbor,
what else did the guy who said love your neighbor said, he said there are some eunuchs who have become that way from birth, right,
and there are some that are made that way by people, right, we've seen it all over the place, we've got eunuchs running around everywhere,
and there are some though, says Jesus Christ, when he is with his children, disciples, saying there are some eunuchs who are made eunuchs,
who make themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven, now I'm telling you, if you are a Christian, you cannot deny that this is the Bible,
this is more Bible than you have ever seen in any English version 1912, Matthew, look it up, he says let the person who is able to take on this burden,
let them take it on, he says, Jesus Christ is talking to you, Timmy, if you want to enter the kingdom of heaven, cut them off,
and I, Jesus Christ, will give you the drugs that will bring you to the new birth.
You mean every time a Christian says I'm born again, they are talking about a process whereby somebody is put through a transgender mystery,
yep, it's all in the pharmacy, it's all in the pharmacy, the drugs don't lie, that's the one thing, never, you can pile all the theology and all the theological radiation you want into this,
you can't beat the drugs, because it's nature, it's nature, oh God, let's go to the next one, it's going to get gross people, just hang on there,
oh this is not the gross part, what does Jesus have in his right hand while he's telling you that if you want to cut off your testicles and transition for the sake of the kingdom of heaven,
what does he have in his hand, he has seven stars, he has seven stars in his hand, okay, all right, for those of you who have ears to hear,
other than that, read Seneca's Medea and you'll see exactly what I'm talking about, give me the next one, look people, because what's going on,
now we're in the graveyard, Jesus is there, Mary Magdalene crew have run out, we're going to keep pounding this graveyard, let's keep walking around these ancient graveyards in Judea and see what happens,
you remember folks, it's like Sodom and Gomorrah, right, there was so much ex-pornating, what did people do, they went after that strange flesh, you know the strange flesh I'm talking about,
they became a paradigm, an example of the burning that is Ionic, wait, are we talking about the same thing, I'm starting to get a little queasy, somebody walk behind me, I need some help,
I need some help, give me the next one, that was Jude telling us what's going on, what are these people doing in these rites, Jude tells us here in verse eight,
what are they doing, they're entering incubations, they're entering into an altered mental state whereby they can see visions, did you wonder why all the PGM was full of all that vision inducing spellery,
take these drugs and stick them here and put them up here, finally swallow them all and stick them in your ear and then you're going to be able to chant blah blah blah all over, god it's just blah blah blah all over, what am I doing,
I'm entering the visionary world, I'm receiving, I'm putting myself into a position that I can receive a vision and you can do that with the drugs, you can do that with the drugs, they are doing it with the drugs and you know what you do with those drugs, you Christ them,
go Christ yourself, you know, you got a problem, you got some emotional problem, you 30 year old with a six graders mind, you know what you should do, you should go off, take a week, go off and purify yourself, go through the motions,
let them give you what they're going to give you and then the stuff that you see that comes out of your soul, okay, they're going to Christ you, please Christ me, give me the next one, give me the next one, here it comes, now people, here's the gross part,
I've saved this for last and I'm going to hit a peak here, we're going to go through this pretty quick and I'm going to hit a peak here, just get you to, you know what, just bring me to the end, let's go all the way, let's go all the way, can we get across the finish line for once,
Ryan, you pastor's wives, can we just once in the train make it across that finish line, before you go back, this is from the letters of Clement, that's what it says and he's writing to Theodore and I just want to remind you that he says, thank you Theodore, good boy, you took, I'm translating right,
look, you took all that dirtiness, those teachings of the Carpacrations and you stifled that stuff, you stifled it, good job, these people who are prophesying are those wandering stars, now that's what the Greeks had called this prophetic ability for years, right, the wandering, the wandering stars,
Jesus has seven of them in his hand, seven of them, okay, are you ready, you're like, huh, you know where he got them, he got them from Mary, he pulled them out of her, he pulled them out of her, okay, if that's confusing, just listen up, these people, he says, these prophets, these wandering stars, they don't follow the very precise, constricted way of the law, no they don't, but they jump into this abyss,
that is a place that you cannot enter and return from, these people are doing it and how are they doing it, they're doing it with the burning purple, they're entering into states of death, he says, it plunges them into that fleshy flesh, doing fleshy flesh, what, oh, you'd understand, you'd understand if you were there,
you'd feel the flesh for the first time, have you felt your flesh, have you felt your flesh, would you be surprised if I told you, you can take it, would you be surprised if I told you, you have not, according to the world of apostles and prophets, you have not understood your own flesh, you have not felt it,
the mystery will cause you to be born again and you will feel your flesh, did he say we would die, listen, listen Eve, you're not going to die, I'll give you the death inducing drugs but it won't kill you,
so we've got this student, Alexandria, Clement, and Mark, the question at hand is what about Mark's gospel, what about all the hidden teachings, what about the stuff that you know we don't talk about publicly,
give me the gorgeous picture by the way, beautiful job, we don't talk about this stuff, what do the people do, says Clement, he says they get all worked up in gnosis, you mean every time Neil comes on here and says, you have just attained true gnosis,
this is what they're talking about, they're talking about being filled with that gnosis which is what, it's the deep things of Satan, do you understand the deep things of Satan, are you pulled to the gnosis,
yeah, give me the next one, what happens to these people, let's see, now remember this is the enemy, because how do these people work, they work through Andrapododon,
they work through what, Andrapododon, that sounds like something, you know, out of place, Epithomeon are your passions,
what are Andrapodotic passions, give me the next one, Andrapodotic passions, this is what they're working through, this is your technical term for what part of your brain they're skimming, are you ready, they're skimming that part that causes you to want to enslave,
causes you to want to kidnap, do you see, this is the summer camp for the Leistai, do you see what's going on here, it's the summer camp, you can take it down for the Leistai, that is what the wandering is all about,
it's what the wandering, now you're going to say to me, you mean there's a cult that has that much control over the people that it can trade, it can trade and traffic, dude, there's not just one cult, right, this is Mediterranean commerce,
this is what the Romans are trying to clean up, and this is why people like Jesus Christ who got arrested in a public park with the naked boy Mark 1451 and 52, this is why he is crucified with other Leistai, there's two other, there's two of them,
they put him right in the middle, put him right in the middle, they're trying to clean this world up, right, Roman law, Roman culture is reaching out, right, trying to create a civilization, right, you can't function,
basically the Mediterranean becomes the place where we're going to civilize, darn it, you know what we're going to do, we're going to build you latrines, you dummies, you can poop in a latrine, not in street,
so you know it's funny, it's not a matter of race or gender, it's a matter of cleaning up your poop, that's civilization, civilization, are you ready, we're ready to go back, are you ready to go back everybody, give me the, oh for my, all I want is to talk to you, I'm going to say happy birth,
Robin, are you kidding, that's fantastic, Robin Mungle, happy birthday Robin Mungle, happy birthday, that's fantastic, wouldn't you like to say something, Chewie says R, right, that's nice, that's nice, I love that, yeah, your birthday wish, what's your birthday wish, don't tell us, don't tell us, send it to me,
okay, okay, are you ready, what's going to happen, what's going to happen, look at the last word in the first line, moustikos, right, he says, Clement says to his body, he says you know what, I'm really glad that you didn't reveal any of that stuff, and he says by the way, Mark, he's not revealing, he's not opening up the mystic side of the gospel,
right, he's not, he's doing what he thinks he has to do, which is with what are useful, things that are useful for the catechumen, for the who, the catechumen, who are the catechumen, they're the boys, don't you understand, supply and demand, they're the boys that are being supplied to the cult,
they get in trouble in Alexandria because the Roman authorities come in and start arresting Christians right and left, why, because they're taking kids off the street, boys, they're taking homeless children that are male off the street, and guess what they're doing with them, I'm going to show you what Jesus does with them,
and why they're doing this in Alexandria, now Mark was smart enough not to reveal this as Clement, Mark was smart enough, give the next one, I know people, what does Mark have to end up doing, he's going to have to end up creating a pneumatic gospel, right, the people who are defending the rights of initiation that are taking place,
these people have to have a justification, so we create the apostles, the people who are involved, the early church fathers, they're involved in this process of making a pneumatic gospel, it's an Alexandrian thing, a pneumatic gospel, right,
now notice who's this for, who's the pneumatic gospel for, you know, if you go to a church, you go to a rescue mission or something like that, you go to, you know, Joel Osteen or something, and you want to accept Christ as your savior, right, that's the gospel, you're giving the gospel,
but at the time that Jesus and his people are doing what they're doing, this is the world you have, you have an inner mystery that is performed, and we're going to leave it out of the gospel, but we're going to leave enough signs in the gospel that people can see it,
the naked kid that was with Jesus when he was arrested with the bandage, that was on, that was on mark, that was meant to give you that which is for the initiated, that's what that says,
it's useful for them, for those who have been initiated, do you understand, so there's Christianity and the faith, and there is an inner mystery that involves drugs, Christ thing and sex, and the Romans eventually end up busting things up, causing a problem,
because the Christians are telling each other, right, don't do this, don't go to this, right, that Jezebel, who is she, who is she, Jezebel, who is she, she's doing this,
people are going there, they're eating her flesh, drinking her blood, all right, that is reserved only for the inner circle, it's reserved only for the elites, those who have been through it, those who have been initiated,
okay, we start off with those what, they start off with boys, children, Christianity is a religion of, I can't say the word on YouTube, it sounds like a fruit, yeah, banana-ing, it's not banana-ing, children, yeah, yeah, that's the way,
that is the way, see, the world is just now figuring out what it means to Christ, eyes are opening, people write to me every day and say, you know what, this stuff didn't make sense until, until you plug it into this, yeah, exactly, that's the history, and that's what our job is,
is to get you that history, give me the line, give me, there's a couple more, yeah, what, yeah, okay, and what are we hiding, people, look at the first word on the third line,
what are we hiding in the Gospels, we're hiding the fact that Jesus was a hierophant, a hierophant, that's what this text says, we're guarding the fact that Jesus was a hierophant, what does a hierophant do,
a hierophant will take you somewhere and do things to you to cause you to enter a state where you will be able to talk to angels, that's what a hierophant does, a hierophant will purify, will baptize you, will purify you,
a hierophant will cause the heavens to be opened in front of you, that's what hierophants do, they cause statues to speak, have you ever seen a statue motivated, they call it motivating statue, have you ever seen a motivated statue, that's a statue that speaks,
hierophants can get you to that place where you can see the statue, speak, isn't that fantastic, I love that, I love that, so what are they hiding, what does that text say they're hiding, they're hiding the fact that Jesus is a hierophant,
Okay, if you thought Jesus was just, oh the victim lamb of God, blah, hoo-ha-boo-ha, gets up on the cross, all of a sudden he's dead and everybody's like, huh, wait a minute, he shouldn't be dead yet, right, that dude just got whacked by some powerful force, right, the lightning struck him,
somebody call scootha, who's that, she's the one who carries around all of that star, yeah, gives you the bath in the start, makes me feel better, does it make you feel better?
Gaius, get in on it Gaius, here we go, that's exactly where we have to be is in that world, in their world because it was the world, the fantasy world that you have of Jesus walking around, did you ever hear Jesus fart anywhere, no, you never, how come, Jesus never farts anywhere, you never seen He farting anywhere, you mean we have text to talk about Him jerking off and eating it,
but we don't have text about Him farting, something is wrong, something is wrong, let out a holy squeaker, right, when there's no evidence of holy squeakers anywhere but the dude is arrested in a public park with a naked kid, what is going on, what is going on, the Olympics was dedicated to Dionysus, now wait a minute people,
let's just, can we just mention real quickly, people are like, oh, we shouldn't talk about this, this shouldn't, this shouldn't, yes, yes we should, good for the French, good for the French, people are pissed off because it implies the Dionysus is the real Christ, guess what, that's what our history says too, do you feel discomfort at that, do you know what's holding off Christian theological,
theocracy, right now, do you know what's holding it off, that free speech is holding it off, give us, give us the tyrants again, where's Talos, Talos get in here, give him, give him again, Talos.
And again, Christians get out and vote just this time, you won't have to do it anymore, four more years, you know what, it'll be fixed, it'll be fine, you won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians, I love you Christians, I'm a Christian, I love you, get out, you gotta get out and vote, in four years you don't have to vote again, we'll have it fixed so good, you're not gonna have to vote.
Look at you, look at you evangelicals, look at you, you Catholics, look at you, do you know what, we don't have to apologize for saying Jesus stole, ripped off the bucket coat, we don't have to do that, the Jews did too, the Christians did too,
why they needed to build some kind of modest reality, and now you and I, you and I who aren't modest, this is coming for us, this is coming for us, this is your mirror, and it's only gonna get better, it's only gonna get better, watch, for the images now to come through, watch for Talos to become reddened in his eyes,
watch for him to ascend, do you know what's funny, you can't take away the power of the muse, you can't take away the power of the muse because she is the one writing the story, isn't that nice, isn't that nice, there's a track that Talos must take, and we're right there, we're right there to watch it happen, this is lovely and perhaps a few of us may participate,
participate, give me the next one, give me the next one, what is the person we're looking at for, this Hierophant, I just wanted to see him, next one, there's the Hierophant, look, people, what does he say, oh God, oh God, what's happening, hang on, no, I'm reading it, so I can't remember what's happening, yeah, oh, so what you do, this thing that Mark, he says this thing that Mark wrote, which has all of those keys in it that are gonna help us,
so that we can perpetuate our sexual drug rights, those things are guarded, he says, very carefully in Alexandria, they're guarded there, right, and they're only revealed to those people alone who are Muo-ing, and you know what that is, you know what that is, what are they Muo-ing, they're Muo-ing the great mysteries, the great mysteries, see the first two words on the bottom line,
you mean Jesus Christ is involved in the great mysteries when he's caught in those tombs with those kids, okay, just bring him on, right here, you know what, bring here, I found tonight people, the kid, the naked kid that was with Jesus when he was arrested in the public part, here's what it says about him, are you ready, are you ready,
the demons, here's the problem with the world people, the demons, they're always out to get people, and they always send somebody along like carpocrates, the carpocratians, right, carpocrates, they always send somebody like that along, and what does he do, he learns those technical arts, and what did he do, he ended up buying somebody off, he ended up attracting someone who would, you know, facilitate the whole lay stick fair,
right, you can't have the boy without the banquet, right, and this is the banquet, so he gets the Presbyterian Alexandria to be, you know, helpful to supply the goodies, and what does he do, he gets a copy of this mystic mark,
yeah, he gets a copy of the mystic rites, the stuff that we don't want the public to see, we don't want them to see it so bad, we tell people who are initiated, what do we tell them, what's the phrase, is this it, no, this is the mystic gospel, that's what we're, that's what we're into people, right, we're at all right, and I'm about to show you what they do in the mystic gospel,
this is not what you Christians who tromp around today, this is not what you know, right, this is the inner core of what Jesus practiced, are you ready, give me the next one, remember, I'm translating, you don't, you don't have to tell people the truth all the time, you don't have to, it's okay,
sometimes it's okay to lie, sometimes when you're protecting people, it's okay to lie, it's okay, if he lies 24 hours a day, it's okay, give me the next one, give me the next one, what happens to the boy, are you ready now, everybody here's the climax, here's the climax, I'm going to talk a little bit after this but I want to bring you to the climax right now, are you ready,
Jesus Christ is here, here he is, he's right there, there he is, hi Jesus, and what is he doing, he, was that Jesus, you heard a great voice coming out of the town, and so you went up to the town, so what did you do, you rolled away this stone, right, from this one tomb, and you went inside it and there was this little kid, so, and he's laying there, like limp, and so you stretched out your hand Jesus, you picked, you revived him,
yeah, after you took him by the hand, you revived him, and when the neonese ghost opened his eyes and saw you, he fell in love with Jesus, and he begged you, he begged you please, please let me be with you, yeah, yeah, so what did Jesus do, well he and the kid went back to the house, the estate,
let's hang on, next one, they went back to this estate, boom, hey I just pulled your kid out of the tomb, right, I just pulled him out, and he's hot to trot for me, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, what's going on, he goes to the kid's home, and of course the kid is wealthy, of course that's what it says, ain't got a blue seal, the dude is wealthy, the kid is wealthy,
so Jesus stays with him for six days, and you know what he does, he trains the kid, Jesus trains the kid, so that on the seventh day the kid comes out, listen people, this is it, this is the disgusting of disgusto, are you ready, it does not get deeper than this,
the kid comes out, comes to Jesus wearing nothing, but a scene done on his private parts, wait a minute, did we see this before, yeah we saw it, Mark, you remember the kid with the scene done on his private parts, the kid comes to Jesus with a bandage after Jesus trained him,
and what happens, they, I'm translating, they spent the night together, and Jesus taught that little boy the mystery of the kingdom of God,
love, it says the boy fell in love with Jesus on waking up, do you know what we become when we follow Jesus, we become his bride, we become his bride, do you know what Jesus wants,
he wants to spend the night with you, if you're a boy, and you're rich, otherwise he's gonna take you out of your family's houses, and out of your father's boats, he's gonna kidnap you,
and he's gonna perform those dirty dirty things that Christ's do, and when those Christ's get arrested, they claim that they are not traffickers, but they crucify him anyway, now the funny thing is,
the funny thing is, if Jesus Christ had gotten the thanosemone on board and hadn't gotten his galene from the child, what would happen, he would have entered death on the cross, but he could have been brought out of it too,
he could have been brought out, he could have been raised, everybody says, oh resurrection, resurrection, fertility, resurrection, resurrection, cool,
you know the actual science and anthropology are way more interesting, if you pull your head out of the fairy tale, let's go, let's go, sorry, that was a little bit, give me, it's the last one, right, so,
I just want you to see the very same language, this is Mark 1451, and there was a little kid, he followed after Jesus, and he wrapped a scene down around his private parts,
they went to seize him, right, cops tried to arrest him, and the kid ran off, and his bandage falls off, do you know what was happening with that bandage, do you see it now,
love drives the mystery that Jesus Christ is promoting, this mystery creates a monistic cage outside of which is death,
the people of the Olympics should not have apologized, there is no sacred state religion, there is none, there will be none,
as long as lady liberty and the republic are alive, is this political, no, this is your reality unfolding, thank you for allowing me to help you to see that,
I want to leave you with an image before I jump to another subject, which is just for those of us who want to be close or connected,
yeah, and by that I mean you being in a classroom where I can give you enough skill in the dojo and show you enough that you can be individually,
your own reader, your own translator, you don't need me to tell you about these orgies, these Christian practices,
you don't need me to tell you that Judaism and Christianity are built upon a child, an industry, an industry, a child industry,
you don't need me to tell you that, you don't need me to tell you that, you can look up those sources yourself, and that's what I want to show you,
thank you for coming to this section of Lady Babylon, I want to say thank you to Teddy for bringing us the most excellent music,
now I'm going to step out and I'm going to tell you, be a little more casual,
until everyone, what I've got going on is I'm going to start teaching three times a week, I'm going to teach a Monday class that is for people who've already been through the course,
we will start week after this coming week, and it's for people who are going to read a text, and the text that I have chosen is Lucian's Ass,
I want everybody to read and just gobble up Lucian's Ass, it's a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous text,
and we need to get that buzz from the text that we can say things like the burning purple, not the burnt purple,
it's the burning, the inflaming purple, right, it's the oyster's fantastic, I want to train people, the Monday is going to be the readers,
people, and I will invite you, you don't have to, I will invite you, now Tuesday and Thursday, what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my studio to nine people,
eight paid, and one not, that one will be there on scholarship, and what you will do is we will just push you through the dojo,
you get time, you know, when I can do you as a group, when I can fashion you as a group, I can do it a lot better than I can when you can't respond to me,
so now I'm a free agent, I just quit my job, I just quit my job, and what I'm doing is I'm opening up the Greek dojo for individuals,
now I have so many applications, I am narrowing down who I'm going to take for the first two classes,
it will be a Tuesday class and a totally separate Thursday class, the Tuesday class will be from seven to nine p.m., excuse me, not nine,
eight thirty, it's an hour and a half, you can't take people beyond an hour and a half without them wanting to jump out a window, you know,
it will be for those an hour and a half, seven to eight thirty p.m., Tuesday, and Thursday, I will pick out nine of you for Tuesday,
and I will pick out another nine for Thursday, my ultimate goal is to get everybody who expressed an interest,
okay, so if you don't get picked this time, think of it as lottery, and think of it as, I'm just trying to get this off the ground,
this is, we're just, you know, this is new stuff, right, and we're training here, a whole bunch of people, I just wrote to, I wrote to Carl Rock today,
and I said, hey, would you let me interview you, just as a classicist, just talk about Greek, and about the process of learning Greek,
and that kind of stuff that I think we could really benefit from when you see somebody who's seasoned in the art, and he's really pushing forward, right,
so there's been such tremendous interest that what I'm going to do is I will email you if you're selected, just like Willie Wonka,
if you get the golden ticket, I'm going to email you by tomorrow noon, and I hope that you can join me on Tuesday night, or on Thursday,
and I'll tell you which one you are, which group you are, if you can't make it, please tell me, I can't make it at that time, I can let somebody else have your slot,
I want to have complete slots before we go forward, and your applications are the basis on which I'm choosing people at this time,
but I got to be quite honest with you, there's a little bit of, there's a little bit of, you know, I don't know, throwing bones and that kind of thing, you know what I mean,
it's hard, it's hard when you get such outstanding response to people who want to take, I mean, we have over 100 people who want to take Greek,
this is crazy, right, so my ultimate goal is to get to everybody, right, is to get to everybody, but now I am going to make this my job,
this is officially this week becoming my job, we will have class Tuesday, we will have class Thursday, okay, Lady Babylon will continue pushing
almond universities in a course, so somebody can come back in six months, and they can say, you know what, I want to take that whole course,
and you just click, click, click through it, see the ending, see the little things that you have to be learning, boom.
Now, the people that are helping, the graduate students, a lot of you graduate students who are helping with the Saturday clinics, the Saturday labs that are in on Discord,
I know, I saw your last message, Nancy, and I know that everything is going swimmingly, people are working hard, and I want to, I want to tell everybody that's a great place to go,
it's a great place to go to get some outside help, right, to get, to, to, to motivate you a little bit more.
The program that we're starting is 20 weeks, that's all we have, 20 weeks to get through that intensive course, and it's all we need if we use our time wisely.
It'll be a pleasure for me to get to know you as individuals, as we're shaping up, as we're shaping up our Greek.
So, thank you for your patience, I know, I've been trying to get this going for a while, and thank you for your patience.
The ultimate goal is to get people reading, and when you see people like Neil, and you see people like Old Boy, and they're sitting there debating about points of grammar,
looking at texts, right, you know that we're building the Renaissance, we're building something that will bring us eternal, eternal glory.
I can promise you that, I can promise you, at the beginning of the Renaissance, what, how does it always start?
Oh, go back to the Greek, go back to Mother Greek, look at what those Greeks were doing, my God, not the Spartans, those people are nuts.
Okay, I wanted to say that, you can be looking in your email, if you don't get a message from me, it means I still have you on the list,
as soon as I get these classes off, I'm thinking about, well then I can start another one, following that, I can start another two classes.
I'll push myself until it becomes physically not sustainable.
The devil tells me, you've got to work for it, brah, you've got to work for it.
So I'm going to be putting the work in, I'm going to be honoring you people as professionals, and I appreciate, I appreciate your interest.
I will be in touch with you shortly, I'll be in touch with you shortly.
And if you're one of those people that I select who says, look, I need some help.
Let me know that, let me know that, I am building scholarships into it.
The purpose is not here to make money, the Marine Corps is not there to make money.
The Marine Corps is there to make Marines, and that's what we want, that's the beauty, that's what brings Renaissance.
So I thank you, I thank you, everybody involved, hats off to the French tonight, all of you folks in the French school,
you know, you know what I'm talking, you know what I'm pointing to, thank you, thank you.
Let us all follow the muse, Hail Satan.
Lady Medea, Lapis Lazuli lines the walls, the muse sings with me, extra illumination for the vibration.
I have under me the knowledge of our Genesis, crystal towers, the Punisher Frank Castle, purple rain.
For the muse I sing her favorite song, all night long, no stem, no seeds, that you don't need.
Got a bag of goodies, ice cream and cream, Hail Satan, close my eyes forever, coming through in waves.
Towerhouse on the hill, House of Frankenstein, darkness through dreams, I dream of Jeannie.
How purple, how did she work you?
How purple, how purple, how purple, how did she work you?
How purple, how purple, how purple, how did she work you?
How purple, how purple, how purple, how did she work you?
How purple, how purple, how purple, baby.
