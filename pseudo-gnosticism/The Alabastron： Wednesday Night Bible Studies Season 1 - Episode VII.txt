mewn Edgeg. These papers are active in the use of
a whole bunch of different drugs meant to induce something called Eustratus,
Oesromania, the thing that the person gets who is stong, Rio, the Christos.
Yes, yes.
Okay.
As we're reading this, I want- we're going to continue.
But I want you to look at- let's- let's finish.
Eoblos, throw Eoblos up there again.
Let's get that.
Yes.
Shedding venom, venomous, of animals, right?
Of animals.
Um look down at the last one.
Number two it says of arrows poisoned and it gives you the
The Orphic Hym, 12 lines 16. 12 lines 16. Can we go to that? We have that. Yes, let's go to that,
that one, the Orphic. The next passage, yes, good, good, good, good, good. And who is this Orphic Hym too?
The Orphic Hym is two Heracles. He's not who you think. You've been living in a fairy tale world. I love
doing this. I absolutely love doing this. You've been living in a fairy tale world, right?
Yes, no, who is the real Heracles?
Yeah, quite a different fellow. Quite a different fellow. Let's just look at this one line.
Yes, look at this. What does he do? He sends out. The command here at the end is to send out
his Kaelas Chalapas, his Kiris. What are Kiris? Kiris are the death spirits
that come for you in your justified right moment. Usually they're depicted in a battlefield
where the Areis is, that repelling force of war. They're usually there and, you know, different cultures
pick these up in different ways, but they're the spirits that go along and harvest. They rip the soul
from the body. Isn't that nice? Anyway, that's what Heracles sends. And how does it say he sends it there?
Says he sends it with his arrows, with his arrows, his flying. Go back please. Yes, with his flying
Ioboloi, his flying Ioboloi. Yes, the delivery mechanism of his Eos. Bring us up the Eos please,
Chewy. Next definition that we're getting to down here maybe. There we go. Eos, take a look at this.
Eos. In one case it's an arrow. Notice at the bottom, good arrow. And then let's go to the next Eos. Oh,
look at this. Poison as of serpents. Poison as of serpents. That's the base of everything that they're
talking about with this communion toxin, right? It's an arrow toxin that they're using. So, again,
get your bearings. Know where we are. You can kind of see the people around us dancing. You know who they are.
Okay, let's go back to, I'm going to read you a couple of things from that translation again. If one of these guys
from the Ioboloi, right, one of these poison throwers. By the way, it's also an apathet
Artemis is called Eokaira. Eokaira, she who dispenses
the Eos. Isn't that nice? And that's why she's a huntress and a midwife. A huntress and a midwife.
It's the poison that connects both of those things because she's using the poison in her
hunting and in her midwifery. Isn't that great? Isn't that great? If one of these Ioboloi should
be overcome in the bending. Yeah, and should take or should take if somebody should take the poma
of the Black Death. Now, realize that is a specific medicine slash communion drink.
The poma. The poma is like the sacred drink. This is the communion, right? It's the prepared cup
that you're taking. Potion. Old, old word. You can translate it as potion, but then you
start to sound like we're drifting into something extremely modern. Yeah, it's the potion of
cyanic death. Interesting that they would call it that. So then you would prepare, he says, you would
prepare the cup, right? That, and you do it through the transition. It's strange, but you do it
through the transition from that dark night, Kulianukta, to the dawn, because that's what we're
doing here is we are bringing the dawn back to the person who has entered into the death.
This is good cult stuff. I mean, come on. Yeah, wow. Yeah, people might want to tell you things
about ancient cults. It's never worth it. Go to the cult itself. Watch how they're interacting.
Remember, this is Nero, by the way, for those of you who are asking the question, what does this
have to do with the Bible? Right? The person who is reading this, who it's addressed to,
that person is the person who beheaded another cult leader. Yeah, very popular cult leader
whose influence became a profound impact. So you've been reading the fairy tale. Now we've
landed in the history and you can see, oh, wait a minute, the dude who beheaded the other dude,
what are the drugs that he was into? Right? What are the drugs? What's going on? Right?
Why is he all the way back in Rome? This is fantastic. Yeah, so you prepare that cup for the one
overcome, right? You set out that chylix, you set out that cup, you prepare it for the one
dom nom nois. That comes from Demazo or Demao or Domno, that one too. They're all from the same
root. It's the delta mu and it means to be subdued by something, to be overcome when you're in that
potion. You are overcome by that force. And do you know who you use in that place? You use
Dom Nomenaeus. Yes, Dom Nomenaeus. Oh, who is he? Right? Remember, we're plugged in with the
analog type. Who is Dom Nomenaeus? He's the one who emerged when Rhea, the flow, the pair of Kronos,
when Rhea reached into the earth as she was giving birth and clenched the ground in her hands.
Dom Nomenaeus came forward. Okay, that's nice. That's nice. I'll show you the magic words at the end,
but I will not give you their meaning. Yes, you have to derive that on your own,
which you will. Let's do that though. Let's go forward. So I wanted you to see that passage
of what is, and by the way, they're leading them to the bed, right? They're leading
the initiate to the bed. And there's a lot about chafing. Earlier on, there's a section about chafing
and about penile problems and about, it's all very Osirian. If you listen to it, it's like being,
I'll describe it this way as I'm sitting there reading it. And having said that, guys, we're going
to step back for a second and say, this document that Nero has managed to get, his grubby hands on,
this document preserves a very, very, very beautiful art. It is using expressions
that are also used, technical terms, that are used by the famous priest Necander, even Cicero,
had read Necander, right? Necander is a priest of Apollo. You like this? Clarion Apollo,
the God of the Oracle. This is who he is. And he's writing to a friend of his and one of his works,
who happens to be the priest of Rhea, civilly, performing the rites of Addis. And he's composed
a song. Necander's composed a song for this guy. And it has to do with, guess what, the drugs,
the drugs within the rite and the poisons and everything immaculate. It's gorgeous. Let's go
to a little Necander. Let's bring him up, shall we? Some Necander. Give me that Necander text.
Yeah. Oh, look at this. Look at this. This is, yeah, this is Necander. I just want you to read
from Haate at the end of the line, Haate Baachai. Like when the Baachans boson shout, shout out, shout out
what, the ox and mouse, that song that they have, that song that they have. Bring it back up, please. Good,
and they are what? Look at the last word in that line, oestroy. What are they under the influence?
They're under the influence of that, that oestress that holds its head back.
Isn't that descriptive? Oh, he's the one who said, Necander said, you've got to watch
the fire of Medea. That stuff will kill you. Yeah. Anyway, good stuff. I love it. I love it.
There's one more, Necander. Can we go to the next passage, maybe? Yes, yes. Here, I put the,
this is the great translation for anybody who doesn't have it. Necander is Gow and Shofield did a
fantastic, leave it up, did a fantastic translation to the best of their ability. Look
along the plants and stuff. Not so good, right? Because it's vague, right? And they're using a priestly
language. So it's a little bit, you know, on times of borders and kind of insanity. What did he say
that? Anyway, um, look at this. Let not the evil ferment of the soul injure a man. It will often
swell up in his chest at other times it will choke him when it is fostered over the vipers coil
deep in its layer, sucking up the monster's venom and the noxious breath from its mouth.
This is the evil ferment, which they call fungi in general, for two different kinds, different
names have been assigned. So you know what that mushroom is? You know that that mushroom
um is especially grown to take in the influence of the viper that ferment
that ferment um is what that mushroom is. Yes. Right? Look at this. Look at the great. It's beautiful.
It's moma. Right? The ferment. Uh, and this is why now all of a sudden it makes sense to you.
Right? Okay. First, let's finish the picture. You see you're watching the vipers. They're calling
around doing their thing and their dens and these mushrooms are there. The mushrooms are absorbing
those toxins. They're absorbing that breath, that vitality. Right? It comes through the
viper. For those of you with ears to hear, you'll hear. And now as you wake up, you know
why Jesus said, watch out for the manna. Right? Watch out for that fermentation.
That fermentation, the fermentation of the Pharisees. Yeah. The fermentation of the Pharisees. Now you
know I call them generation of vipers. Right? It's we're working under the same system. Right? Jesus
is no dummy. He's picked up the right. He's picked up the influence from uh, and the candor, I forgot
to tell you, is like second century BC. Second century BC. And it's so popular. Everybody by
first century when Jesus and his crew are out. Everybody there is, he's in the atmosphere. Right?
One of the few that is. And his works really had a huge effect. There's a lot of business team work
done specifically on the candor. Right? Most classical scholars avoid him like the plague
because his Greek is impenetrable. Yes, you heard me. His Greek is impenetrable. If you want, next time
somebody boasts to you, that they can show you Greek, flash up the very first thing that we
are a bit from Nero today, that we had just flashed that up. He won't be able to translate. I guarantee
you, I guarantee you people, and you, and let me tell you why, because in that passage are
Hapox Legomina. Words that only appear here. Right? So we have problems. We have problems
in translating this stuff. What do we do? We do what the Victorians did. We run back to Ezekius. We
resurrect this guy from the fifth century, fourth and fifth centuries. We resurrect him. We say,
tell us what these words mean. And we go back to Aisa. And we look at Aisa and we see what she,
we see what she, what she says. Can we have the next reading? We need to proceed. We have
eight, nine more minutes until we self-destruct. Yes, one of those, sure. Let's go. I want you to look
at the mazo just to be overcome, to be overcome. Look at, I want the second one here. Just take a look
at number three of the powers of nature. It's overpower. Dom na meneus, baby. Dom na meneus.
Okay, keep going. This is real. We are at the place where the magician comes into being.
I mean, we're with the dactyls. We're with the dactyls. This is good, good old magic. This is
Mycenaean stuff. Right? This is snake goddess. Phil, we love this. Okay, let's get another reading
up here. Yes. Oh, why not? Let's go ahead and throw up the Ephesia Gramata, right? The Ephesian words,
right? These were written. Well, they're written in a lot of places in antiquity.
You can look it up and find yourself a list of what sources we have that have them. But you really
want to talk about the Temple of Artemis, right? At Ephesus, where this cult seems to be coming from.
These words are words. And of course, they have this wonderful library. Look at this wonderful library,
right? This is coming from the cults that you and I are worshiping. You and I are working with now,
right? This library is, that's where it's coming from. Pythagoras says that, right?
If you want to found a city, you should build a Temple of the Mews, right? Start with your museum.
Anyway, let's put up the Ephesian letters. And what people have traditionally said about these
is that these writings, is that it reflects an older language. Is it Greek? Well, it's expressed in Greek.
Yes, yes. Oh, the very last. Let's go to the very Ephesian letters here at the end.
There. Gramatha. There. Okay. And look, it's expressed in Greek. You can see it in Greek.
Aschion, cataschion, lyx tetrax, dam nam meneus, aesion, or aesia. Now, if you don't know,
if you don't know what any of these words mean, you're at a loss. What they're used for
is to prevent, to prevent any sort of activity, quantum activity, if you will, that would be
an attack upon oneself. It's a defensive measure. Report, supposedly, you know, there are people,
famous people from Antiquity who would use them, right? Marcus Reilly is being one of them, but whatever.
Yeah. So what do they have to do? What do they have to do? Let's see what people have traditionally
made of and pull that up. Yes. Aschion. And they say, perhaps has something or ancient sources
that say something to do with shade, perhaps. Please leave that up. Thank you. And lyx. Yeah,
what is the lyx? If you look this one up in Hesechius, you can find out what it means.
And it'll be part of a piece of the puzzle for you to put together. He'll tell you about the
Plagios, right? Anyway, Tetrax, Tetrax, right? Is that the four cornering? Is that the four seasons?
Are we getting into the Ori? Well, what about the next name? Dom Naminnaeus? Yeah, right? Dom
Naminnaeus. Now the Icyon and Icya, right? He's the power, by the way. The Dom Naminnaeus is the one
who is performing the initiation. He's the one who's going through the actual
right, right? It's the diamond in the individual becoming one, right? It's an act of possession.
It's an act of possession. But if you look at Icyon, right, and Icya, right? And you'll notice that
we have, for the first time, a very good example of insertion with C, as in Sibule,
right in the middle of the word to interrupt the flow. And this is something you're going to catch
over and over again in the PGM that they're doing. They play with syllables. They reverse them. They turn
them around. They'll take half of one and make an insertion like we just saw. And those are the
operating. Those words that they're doing that with are the operators. Look through the PGM, the
spells, and you'll see that there are specific operating words. So that is an incantation
that was popular in antiquity. If you could perform it properly, if you could perform it properly,
and it had to be repeated in a very specific way so that the voice could access that
invisible dimension around. It's like using that voice creates visibility.
Yeah. Fantastic. The sex part, you promised the sex, right?
You'd notice that they were leading the gentleman to the bed, to the bed, and the
person who is being initiated engages in a sexual activity at a specific time
under the influence of specific drugs. So, as detectives, we're one step closer.
If we just step back and look at the crime scene, the mob is there. They're all yelling out,
kill him. You've got a whole group of people just pissed saying kill him. He's arrested
in a public park at 4 a.m. with, in the company, of a naked boy. And the naked boy has what is
arguably a medicated bandage used in right involving the making of a cup.
Yeah. Yeah. And the consumption. So we have to stand back when I say, okay, I know that within
these rights, we have other examples of people who were engaged. The Greek word there was coitus.
You know, we get coitus from it. So we now have your honor. We now have a motive here. We have
other contemporary cults that are doing the same acts that are involved in drug-induced ritual
that is sexual in nature. So this is where, now you see why the London Times said this area
is the last wild frontier of classics, right? It's truly an open field. The fact that nobody
is working on this is only a cause by our own society's
laziness. You know, people don't want to study these texts because it's hard. It's hard. You give
that sheet to any professor, any professor who claims to be, especially one of these religious
historians, give them that and say, okay, Smartie, who says they translate this. Yeah, you watch what
happens because some of the words are rooted in traditions that they don't follow. If you want
to know the good stuff, you got to drink the fire. You know what I mean? You got to go deep and you
got to see what's going on. Okay, thank you very much. Now we're going to turn to Rob who is going
to. Rob, tell me something. I want to put this quote up on the screen and I want people to see
and I want you to tell me a little bit if you can about the gentleman that we're putting up here.
Yeah, I would like to write a book which would drive them in mad, which would be like an open
door leading them where they would never have consented to go. In short, a door that opens
onto reality. Thank you, Mr Artoe. Do you want to add us something if you could resurrect this man
from the grave? Would he have anything interesting to say relevant? Oh, yeah, interesting,
irrelevant. But it's a story and it's a very interesting story that goes back. He's an
ancestor to some degree. I don't know what degree he's an ancestor, but to some degree he is.
And we were talking about him last night and you've really got me going into the research
and I've got to start at the beginning. I've got to go back to the beginning and I've got to go to the
discord, a discord that's happening on the beaches of Troy. I want to take you back to the beaches
of Troy, where there's a discord going on between Agamennmon and Achilles. There's prizes that
have been distributed and there's a plague. He mentioned the plague recently and there's a plague
going on and they're trying to appease the plague. Apollo sent the plague and they try to appease it
and prizes have got to go back and prizes are getting mixed up and distributed about
and Achilles isn't happy. Achilles is just about to draw his sword and Agamennmon has been disgraceful
towards him and he feels it. So he's about to draw his sword and down comes Athena and we all love
Athena. Even Achilles loves Athena, he listens to her. She comes down and she
stops him, she checks his rage and she's probably the only person Achilles would listen to.
So he listens to her and he checks his rage and he leaves and he walks away. He walks away from
the problems he's having and he makes his way to a beach. He loses his prize and he makes his way
to a beach and he sits on the beach and he's looking at the grey sea and that's all he's doing.
So I get to this point with Homer in the beginning of the early ad and
I'm thinking, can I introduce Heraclitus? Would I be able to introduce him?
And because he's a miserable sod Heraclitus says, you know, he doesn't mix well, he doesn't go
go into town that often, he takes himself off and he likes to take himself off and Achilles has
took himself off so I'm thinking maybe we've got this time machine and I can move Heraclitus
next to Achilles, forgive him a bit of advice maybe. This guy is a hell of a philosopher,
not much of Homer if you know your Heraclitus. I thought I should have been clubbed and thrown out
but here we are and I want to sit with Heraclitus to sit with Achilles and if
Chiri you can bring up my first image please. We're not prepared on this in with the images.
Here we'll search for him, you keep going with the narrative please. Okay well I'll just come with
the quote and we've got a quote from Heraclitus and the quote is, what opposes unites and the finest
attunement stems from things bearing in opposite directions and all things come about by strife
and I'm going to read it again, what opposes unites and the finest attunement stems from things
bearing in opposite directions and all things come about by strife and I think Achilles listened
to this point and so we moved into Purgatius. Now I've got little things all littered around
my screen here and it all stems in one question, I've got one question for the gallery out there
and anyone who's interested in Armen's work and interested in getting involved in it and
I've kind of got an example of how fascinating these things can be and how they can work,
they're incredible. So the question is how do we get from the Marquis
decide to the centre of the universe and I've got this littered all around everywhere and I think
what I've been given is a mirror of sorts, it's a gentleman I'd like you to look into
and you've seen his quote at the beginning but we're looking for recognitions, I'm looking for
recognitions in this and recognitions of a self, of a human, of the entire subject, everything
and you've been asking for a spell, you've been asking for magic and I bought you some tonight,
we're going to have a look at it, we're going to have a look at a spell tonight and it's dark,
it's extremely dark and if you thought Marquis decide was bad then get ready for this one.
What can you tell us Rob about the asylum, is there a benefit to staying in the asylum
because both the ghosts that you are bringing together here, two of the several that you're
bringing together brilliantly, is they were in insane asylums, the Marquis was in insane asylum
and correct me if I'm wrong but it was Arthau as well. Correct 10 years, 10 years and even in care
when his group of friends helped get him out, got him out of the asylum he was in
and that's where we'll go to the Ville d'Evrard and we'll move into Lunatic asylum and we'll view
I hope you've got this one Cherry, I hope you've got the image of the spell
and we'll go into a spell and we'll find out how we get from the Marquis decide
all the way to the great mother, I believe. Real quick Rob go ahead and email me that thing again
and we'll get it up here, give it to me again it's not coming through on our end. Okey dokey,
how do we get to Jacob's Ladi and how do we get to the centre of the universe?
Let me just get this up then, I'm sorry.
As we're waiting for this, people should be thinking about things like
French film and should be tracking down our toad if I'm pronouncing his poor name properly.
Okey, I've done that again. Ah Toe, yes, like Toe.
So let's just bring it together for people as Chewie gets this. Let's just bring it together
for people and make sure that they see this is a necromantic act, right? We have to bring together
these forces that we're performing necromancy. Go ahead, can you put that up,
what we've got is a gentleman who's treated as a lunatic and locked away as a lunatic.
He essentially is one of the most brilliant men there is around his time and he's recognised for
these facts by Matisse, by Picasso, by all the intellectuals around in his day. This gentleman
has taken quite a hit in his life basically because he didn't have the finances
to keep himself out of a lunatic asylum. So then he was put in a lunatic asylum by decree.
That's where he's gone. The friends decided they went and visited him and they thought
we're a terrible state. What changed in them 10 years is tremendous. He'd been in there and had
over 50 bouts of electroshock therapy, various degrees of therapy that just ruined you.
There we have the spell. This is a guy who is qualified. He knows his stuff. He's not a person.
He doesn't know how to write a spell. This is a self-titled spell. It's from May,
the 14th, 1939, and it's addressed to Mademoiselle Moseille. She never received this letter.
Mademoiselle Moseille never received this. It's purple crayon and coloured pencils.
You can see the state of it. It's beans. It's got beans in it.
And I'll take you through the description in the book it's in.
And it was made on the third and fourth pages of a letter signed and dated, as I've said.
The letter with its spell must have been entrusted with a visitor who had come to see
Otto at Villebrade to be delivered to the addressee who never received it.
The paper is being in several spots and one outer edge with a cigarette or match.
It reads, you will live a dead woman. You will not cease. Departing this life and descending,
I send you a force of death.
Shocking.
Read it to us, read it to us, Rob, one more time. I want to hear it one more time. You will what?
You will live a dead woman. You will not cease. Departing this life and descending,
I send you a force of death. It's a death threat.
Fantastic. You really know what they're doing.
Fantastic. Isn't that great? You look what you did. You brought it up.
Look what the news did. Wait, where are the news?
That's what I'm trying to get across to right now to your listeners, to the people who watch.
I never expected this. I never expected this to turn up yesterday. I'm very young in
my research and I spoke to him last night. We just thought it was fantastic and he asked
me to come on and talk about it. Also show me face because I have disappeared.
That's where Heraclitus comes in for me. Heraclitus, I took a bit of solace in Heraclitus
for a while. I took a step out and that quote is fantastic. Have you got that quote where you
can get it up for me to you? It's number one because I think that's really important.
No, it's okay. We're going to have to call it there.
What the message is trying to get across. How do I get from a death threat spell
for what is all intents and purposes the work of a man locked away in a lunatic,
asylum? He's poverty stricken, he's addicted to opium, he's destitute,
and he's had all this treatment that's completely ruining him. How do I get
from that death threat to something good in this gentleman? Why am I presenting this guy?
Why would I present this guy to you? Is writing death threats and why would we be interested
in this, Jack? You've got to ask the same question of all the intellectuals around in France of his day.
Of his day, these intellectuals got together and the Matisse and Picasso, among other artists,
sold works, sold parts of their works, is a fund for him and they put a benefit on for him at the
share of Bernard Centre. All these intellectuals of the day came out and they read excerpts from
his work and celebrated him and he is celebrated in France right now and he's unaid off,
essentially, I'd never heard of him and the only reason I did hear of him is because of that last name,
Otto and I've got a relative, he was an Otto, I've got a great great grandad, he was a French guy
who came over from France as a master builder. He had no money either but he came over as a master
builder and made his way and I have no idea what the link is there but it seems like when I've looked
through this chap's artwork and I've looked through this chap's interests and I've looked through
his images and I've seen quite a few recognitions and as I say at the beginning they were looking
for recognitions, I want people to recognise these things such as how we treat these people.
That recognition was disgraceful, it's absolutely disgraceful. You know,
I'm on, you could be treated the same and you've had comments on the YouTube, you've had comments on
the Discord and dealt with, albeit dealt with, you know, but they come through and they're disgusting,
these things are, they're disgusting now, the way they can treat people in another day and another
time, we'd be burnt, I'd have been, I'd be burnt for reading out a spell. This guy was an atheist,
he was a complete atheist and he was very, very intelligent and he knows his stuff, you can tell,
in all his quotes you can tell, in all the markers you look for, you know, as I say, he's took me to,
he's took me to the battle, he has, there's a word that I want to share and it's battle
and I'm going to cut off there, because this is a long thing, this isn't going to just end today
with one presentation or one conversation about it, this is a long conversation, this guy is well
read, well studied and in all the things we are becoming well read and well studied then,
shall we change, you know, I think he's got a lot to offer, Osh.
So, Rob is going to say that France, that France puts those who are inspired by the news into insane
asylums, is that a, is that a bigger statement on life, what do we leave with that, this is Mr
Rogers, which it isn't, but if it were, what would that leave us with, you gave me to gentlemen
who were put into geniuses that were put into insane asylums, is that because the physics of
the universe just doesn't, is that just what it bends toward, is that the bending, we all have
to become lunatics and throw our heads back and become bockens so they can put us away, is that
where you're going with all of this? No, where I'm going with all this is the ancients need better,
didn't they, the ancients need better than this, they didn't have lunatic asylums did they,
were the lunatic asylums, I'm on, can you answer that? No, lunatic asylums, no, lunatic asylums,
you're really talking about exiles and yeah, the guys hanging out, the homeless people that
hang out in the cemetery, right, those are your lunatic asylums, right, and the prisons, right,
those are, and there are some in the palace, there are some lunatics in the palace. Yes, yes, or are the emperors
because that's where we're going to go, we're going to go to an emperor with this chap, this chap
wrote a lot, he wrote a lot about succubation, incubation, he wrote a lot, he wrote a lot about
emperors and I don't want to reveal everything on this one occasion, I just wanted to introduce the
guy and I wanted to explain where I've been and what I've been up to and how this subject can affect
just a normal individual, I'm just a normal individual doing normal things, living a regular life
and I've attempted to drop the subject, I've attempted, I've tried to drop the subject and try to
carry on with normal life, you know, do the regular stuff like DIYing and the irregular stuff and it's
it's all consuming, it's all consuming at times and you have to take a break, so I did
and I took a break and in then two days I received this and I can't ignore this, you can't ignore it
can you, something like this comes, you see the name auto and you're just an enemy and I shouldn't be
but I am, I don't know how I got here, I don't know why I'm delivering this but I am, no idea why
yeah and to that, to that I say Hail Satan and beautiful, yeah beautiful, look we're gonna
have him back, we're gonna have our toe back, right now he's one of our ghosts, so get comfortable
with him, get comfortable with him and that's why I want other people on the discord, I want other
people to be to be working toward this goal of gaining these souls and and pulling them out of
that nether where they are and bringing them back because their voices are the powers that are
behind what's going on, right, everybody here believes the fairy tale, we all believe the fairy tale
until you get to the crime scene and then your reality opens up and all of a sudden these ghosts
they're all pertinent, they're all relevant to what we're doing, so yeah we are necromancers,
congregation of Satan, don't forget that. Rob, thank you very much, I'm gonna call it, I'll be
able to come to discord for just 15, 20 minutes tonight but Rob, I think the dead owe you a gratitude,
thank you. Oh I am a gratitude I think, I owe everybody gratitude, I am very grateful
but I'm young man and I have to do my own thing and by doing that I think I'll get there,
I'll help in other ways, that's right, Hail Satan, all the best to everyone, Hail Satan, all the best.
