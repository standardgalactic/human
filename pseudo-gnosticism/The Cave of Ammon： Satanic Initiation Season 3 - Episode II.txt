I never meant anything I said, just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin'
Keepin' from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant
I never said the letters that I should've said
But so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
When I say, never meant nobody no harm
When I say, never was the cost of a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Hello and welcome back, welcome back
It's nice to see everyone
We have a great, great, great topic to delve into tonight
And a place to go
And I'm very happy to say that at the end of our time together tonight
Our 30 minutes, we'll have four very well-known guests
Who will give us an announcement
Yes, we have a great announcement to give tonight
Fantastic, I can't wait
Those of us who value honor will feel the shame of our ancestors
Yeah, this should prove to be an outstanding time
We're gonna start off
We're gonna start off with...
Oh, excuse me
We're gonna start off...
I'm sorry, a little direction problem
Don't worry, Chewie, I'll tell you when
We're gonna start off today
Though with our section on the Cave of Amon
And we're going to take now the next step down
In our descent into the Chthonian realm
Again, we're gonna do it by bringing the future and the past together and present
Fantastic, we'll begin with a look at Anastasia
And so I wanna run a couple of...
Just a couple of clips
Say a couple of things
And hone kind of focus where we're looking here
Remember, we're searching for Lady Babylon
And under the right circumstances, everything can come together
So tonight I wanna start off with a couple of clips that we've put together here
From Neil's interview with Anastasia
And I want us to look at just responses
I just wanna see what are responses
As if we're just having tea saying what is this situation
And who is this person?
Let's run the first one
I'm like a volunteer obviously
But I talk with soldiers quite a bit
And it has not diminished
People are very hyped and still willing to do what is necessary to do
And people always say we didn't choose the war obviously
But it's here, so what else can you do other than defend what you love
And what we love is Ukraine and our people
So people from the West say we should stop this war
We should go for peace agreements
Because we care about Ukrainian people
And yet no, you don't
If you cared about Ukrainian people, you would listen to what Ukrainian people want
And what we want by every estimation, by every poll in existence
Is to continue fighting no matter what
And to return our people back home
And what Russians are doing to those people there is atrocious
And in ways I cannot even describe to you
Every liberated city has had mass graves
Tortures, rapes, slaughter of civilians on insane scale
And this is the weight for us to liberate them
So this is not negotiable
We are not giving up those people to Russia
And to this nothingness basically is what expects them if we give up on them
So what we've got is some more of the shenanigans
And now the criminal courts have declared that
Hey look, Vlad Putin is taking children
Look at the irony, if you cannot taste the irony of this
Vlad is abducting children like a pirate
Yeah, and he's forcing them, putting them in camps
Forcing them to speak Russian
No more Ukrainian
No more Ukrainian, you'll speak Russian
Look at the irony here about the Russian people
No more Ukrainian, you'll speak Russian
Look at the irony here about those who support Putin
This is a strong woman
People talk about a strong woman in the States
This is a strong woman
She was involved in the 2014 revolution
And when I get a chance to interview her
I've been waiting
Apparently, Kharkiv was hit by
Gifted with hypersonic missiles and drones
And all sorts of things to keep them in the dark
So as soon as we can, I will get an interview for her
She's agreed to do it
And I'm going to ask her
I'm going to ask her about the nitty-gritty
Let her speak
Chewie, hit her again
With the western support we are having right now
We have every chance to win it
And we intend to
We intend to do that
And I hope we will
Continue, please do if you can
To support maybe Ukrainian volunteers
I have PayPal as well, by the way
On my Twitter, which you can help out
And see what I'm doing on Twitter
I post pretty much everything I'm doing
And yeah
So assist organizations that help Ukraine
Such as Come Back Alive, for example
Which is a pretty good fund to help Ukraine
Or maybe help volunteers like me, for example
And people who are doing projects
Of helping our army in every way we can
And also talk with people about it
Is also very important
To fight against some narratives
That Russia propaganda continues to spew
And those who support Russia in the west as well
So do try to fight them back
And to spread the word
So bringing this message
Just how difficult is it for us
Just to bring, we have the technology now
We can bring her message out
Right, and we can show the world
Right, we can be those people
Who put that statue of the virgin on the hill
And said freedom, that's what it's about
That's what it's about, one more time
So they already did some moves
Like they did in 2014 to achieve that
And I do think they would be full on
Ready for all out invasion
Into Georgia and Valdova
But then is, we put them up, you know
So they are stopped currently at Ukraine
Which is, I guess for us to be the shield sort of
To Georgia and to Valdova
And protect countries from
With our bodies and lives, you could say
Because they should not move anywhere further
And they should be stopped for good
This time around, I hope
Why are we not helping these people?
Why are we not helping these people?
Why are we giving money to Ukraine
If we could help this and help that
And you just, dudes, we super appreciate the help
Obviously, right, without it would be
But it's not because you give money to Ukraine
That are homeless people in the United States, you know
They just point out various problems
In the United States, and they try to blame it
On the United States helping Ukraine
Against this unjust invasion
Which is pretty strange
Because there's no connection to those things
Whatsoever
Yeah, fantastic, right
Listen to it from the source
I mean, isn't that what we need anyway?
You don't need any commentary
You don't need to explain it
You just need to hear the voice
We're going to hear one more
And then we're going to jump into the cave
What he's talking about is Holodomor
Which is the famine I mentioned
Four million people plus died in that
So not only they were like
Starved to death in Ukraine
But also they would take food
Like Soviet soldiers take it to Moscow
Export it, continue to sell it
While people were just straight up dying of starvation
So five-width loss is something that was on the books
So it's the fact that you can shoot
A person in Ukraine in the head
For stealing food
So basically starving people would still
Still is not the word I would use
But would still the food they themselves grow
To not starve and to feed their families
And they would be shot for that
So this was a very much
A genocide in every sense of the world
And yeah, it's not only that
Like I said, it's mass deportation
Oppression, executions
There was like Red Terror period
Which was right after Revolution
Basically in October
So that was the period when Red Terror
Was happening in Ukraine as well
So people were just killed, dragged down
Out of their houses, shot
For not being willing to be part of
Soviet Union Russia
Yeah, and that's what's coming
They're standing in the breach there
And that's what's coming
So what is
Terribly ironic
And yet beautiful at the same time
Is that the group that holds the signs
That say save the children
Is the group that supports and pushes
The Putin's desires
Whether it's one of our former presidents
Or whether it is
People in our government
This faction is there, right
So what do we need to do
What do we do, but listen to those voices
But bring those voices
Here and say
What is she saying
Where is this dragon
Who
Breeze the fire
Yeah, where is this
Truth
That we're looking for
I guarantee it's on the side of protecting
The mothers and the daughters
I guarantee you
Now he's taking camps
Shame on us
Let me just say something to the Americans
In the group
I know there's others from other countries
But to the Americans
Man, it was our experiment
Right
This was handed down to us
The people who created this freedom
That you feel and breathe
And live in
Those people said you have to
Stand
You have to stand
And if it meant going off
To a foreign country
To help
The cause, then that's what they did
That's what they did
Freedom, we need freedom
Not this tyrannical stuff
Is not new
Is not new
So I hope to have
Anastasia
In interview form and I'll bring those
I'll bring those into you
In short two minute clips
Like this letting her give her
On straight up answers
And there is a
Direct link of course
To our cave
Our cave
Let's bring up the first of the cave tonight
We're going to go to the Orphic Fragments
Here's that guy I've been blathering
About for so long, Otto Kern
Thank you Otto Kern, there's your name
So here we go
Otto Kern's Orphic Fragments
Number two please
Yes, here we go
I'm going to look at, this is from
Diodorus Siculus
Diodorus Siculus, give us Diodorus's picture please
This is, you know, just a
Made up representation for all we know
You look nothing like this, right?
But here we
Here we have his work, right?
He's writing histories
First century, first century
He's writing great, wonderful
Wonderful stuff, he's trying to go
Back to the roots
Of the people that were
Migrating around, remember we talked about
These migrations, these bronze
Age migrations, tonight
We're going to go one step back
To the
Prehistory
To the
Autochthenist people
People called the Pulaskians
And you're going to be surprised
To find out the things that you got
From certain places you didn't
This is before
Christianity
This is before Judaism
Yeah, this is before
Any of the monotheistic
Theistic religions
Before those things were kicking off
Well, they had some in Egypt too
Right? But before those
Movements within the mysteries
Kicked off
We have these Pulaskians
And we have these rights
Preserved within the language
And I'm going to take you back to some
Of the old language, we're going to go
To the Virgin
We're seeking the Virgin
Yeah, the maiden
Right? Yeah
Please, so in this fragment
What do we have here? Number four
This is from Diodorus
And he says
Gramasi
That's the words I want you to hear
Gramasi
Yeah, they say that
Linus
Composed
The deeds of
Work on the deeds of Dionysus
And that he did it
In the Pulaskian
Letters
In the Pulaskian letters
Yeah, and he left it behind
In his little
Memoirs
Yeah, nice
Also Orpheus
Orpheus and
Pronapides
Pronapide
Don Homeron di Dascalon
Yeah, pronapides the teacher
Of Homer
Oh, nice, nice
So here's Orpheus and here they're
Using the Pulaskian
Letters and you say, wait a minute
Pulaskian, what?
Remember, I've been asking you
To solve the question
Of the dragons
Tom, right?
People are working on it
Nice job guys, yeah
Yeah, Anya, love it
Love it, fish, love it
You're working on those things
And tonight we're going to have some
Little clues
Tonight
We're not working with the orphic
Letters
We're working with the Pulaskian
Letters
Pulaskian Letters come before
Come before everything
For everything
We're talking pre-Egyptian
Culture
We're talking pre-
Indo-European
We're talking about
The basis, the language
The human language is spread out
Through the Mediterranean
And from which we're driving this
Right and this history
Yeah, let's go to the next one please
I want to start
Here, now Linus
They say, composed an account
In the Pulaskiic Letters
Of the deeds of the first Dionysus
And of the other mythical legends
And left them among his memoirs
And in the same manner
Use was made of these
Pulaskiic Letters by Orpheus
And Pronapides, who was a teacher of Homer
Great, and a gifted writer of songs
Right
Notice, I just want you to see
He mentions Lea Meaden
He talks about going to Nissa
Where the ancient natives of the city relate
The Dionysus was reared there
Yeah, and that there's this thing
Called a
Frigian poem
Yeah, okay
Next text please
This
Is the expression
Yeah, in the Pulaskian Letters
Good, I want you to look at that
Pulaskian, who are these people
Go down
This then is the account
Of Dionysus, among the Greeks
Linus was the first to discover the different
Rhythms and song
And when Cadmus brought from Phoenician
The letters, as they're called
Linus was again the first
To transfer them into the Greek language
To give a name to each character
And to fix its shape
Now the letters as a group are called
Phoenician
They were brought to the Greeks from the Phoenicians
But
As single letters
The
Pulaskians were the first to make use
Of the transferred characters
So they were called Pulaski
Okay
You see what I'm saying
So this is an old
Old, old, old
Not this guy, get him off there, we'll bring him back in a second
This isn't, that's a Lemnian
Steel, anyway
This
Pulaskian language that predates
There's
Questions, who are these Pulaskians
And what are they doing now
These Autochthenist people spread throughout
From Asia Minor into Greece
Right, here's the sites, nice map
There, look at, they're on the island
Of Lemnos up there
Yep, off the coast of Thrace
Right, Samothrace
See Samothrace there, take it down
If you were sitting there on a beach
In Thrace
You can look
And you can see Samothrace there, nice island
Beyond that
Beyond that, where it's no longer visible
Is that Lemnian
And we have a Lemnian Steely
And it has on it
The characters that
They were debating about, this is Lemnian
We're going to call it Lemnian
But long story short, it turns out
It's Pulaskian
And logically it looks
Not like Etruscan
Yeah, it looks like the Pulaskians
In the Etruscans are the same people
Those of you who are
Learning dragon tongue
The Orphic
Letters
Can use this
To help you decipher them
Okay, and let me
Just pull that up again, by the way
This is in Bustrophodon
So, for those of you who are saying
Wow
Is it go right, left, left, right?
Yes, the answer is yes, it goes both
It's like a snake
More than a
More than a cow walking around
But okay, whatever
They didn't call it Ophistrophodon
Yeah
It's a woofer snake
Okay, next
Next slide, please
How did the Phoenician
Letters appear on the Greek mainland?
The Palace of Cadmus
Is an historical figure
It's been discovered in Thebes
And maybe roughly dated
Around 14 to 1200 B.C.
And letters were found in it
But they were not of Semitic origin
Take it down, that's in the
American Journal of Philology
Now we're going to philologists
I'm going to quote a few philologists here tonight
Because this is the stuff that turns them on
This is all you do with it
You're trying to figure out where these languages come from
That's why anybody who forbids you
That's a bad, bad dude
Bad dude
Yeah, needs to be stopped
Yeah
So we're talking
Early on 1600
Right, next slide, please
Thank you, Chewie
Now Linus they say
Compose an account in plastic letters
The deed to Dionysus and the other mythical legends
And left them among his memoirs
In the same manner
Please go on
Yes, here we go
Further
Further in there is a cave
Let's just go to the cave
We're walking around, sorry that was a little herky-jerky
But we're walking around with
The Pulaskians
And their religion
And we're going to their religious sites
And we're going to look at their gods
All the
Oomph, oomph, oomph
Is a Pulaskian sound
Isn't that nice?
You see it in things like chords
So there are Pulaskian roots
All over the place in the Greek world
In the Greek world
And they talk about
The Pulaskians are all over the sources
You can go look them up
And
You'll find them in historians
You'll find them in playwrights
From Sophocles
Yeah, isn't that cool?
Anyway, it looks like
They were considered
To be the ancestors
Right?
But considered to be the
Greeks
Sometimes they're described as Greek
Yeah, and
They're ending up in a lot of
Old, old, old Greek religion
Coming out
We're going to look at one that shocks you tonight
From
The Septuagint
Believe it or not, it's buried in the Septuagint
Isn't that cool?
Alright, bring up that next one
Here we go. Further in there
Is a cave circular in shape
Of a marvelous size and beauty
Just get the cult context going in your head
For above and all about it
Rises a crag of immense height
Formed of rocks of different colors
For the rocks lying bands
And sin forth a bright gleam
Some like that purple, which comes from the sea
For the entrance-grown marvellous trees
Some fruit-bearing, others evergreen
And all of them fashioned by nature
For no other end
And to delight the eye
Take it off
And to open it
Yeah, to open it
Coming from the side was the expression
Yes, yes
Okay, next
Same slide, good
Now to this cave, the account runs
Amen came and brought the child
That is Dionysus
You mean Dionysus
Is a child of Amon?
Yes, he is
And gave him into the care of Nissa
One of the daughters of Aristaeus
And he appointed Aristaeus to be the guardian
Of the child
He being a man who excelled in understanding
And self-control and all learning
The duty of protecting the boy
Against the ploddings of his stepmother Rea
He signed to Athena
Who a short while before had been born
And had been found beside the river
Triton
Good, good
That's why we call it Tritonian
Nice
We need to find a location and a place for this
We need to zoom in with the language
We need just to let the language
Carry us to that place
We're keeping our hand on the rope
In the cave as we go through it
As we go through it, good
Next text
Yeah, I'm not going to read all this
I just want you to see
When the valor and fame of Dionysus
Became spread abroad, Rea
Angered at Amon, strongly desired
To get her Dionysus into her power
Okay, I want you to realize
There is a struggle going on
And that you see the word Crete
Right, as for Cronus
The myth relates, after his victory
He ruled harshly over these regions
Which had formerly been
Amon's
Okay, take it off
Yes, the father
Of the first
Dionysus
The father of the first Dionysus
Is usurped
By
The Saturn
Yeah, okay
Alright, so that should put you in some context
Take out your everybody
Pull out your augers now
Right
Right, you know where we are
Sun, moon and stars, okay
Hit it with the next, please
We're running from time tonight
Go ahead, yes
Since the Libyans had said to Dionysus before the battle
That as the time when Amon had been driven
From the kingdom, he had prophesied
That's what I want you to see
Amon is
The prophetic
God
There is a reason that that cult
Is spread throughout the Mediterranean
And always has that
Irracular
Current to it
Always has that irracular
Current to it
The Dodonian
Prophecy
That is so important to the Greeks
Right
Everybody goes to Dodona
Right, that's just the way it is
It's one of big, big oracles
And
That's Pulaskian
Yes
So you see the operation
People say did this come from Egypt
Did this come from what about this
What about Phoenicians
There were no Phoenicians around
They only called themselves Phoenicians
Because of what the Pulaskians
Were doing and the name Pulaskian
As a classical
Philologist
Looks like it comes
From the word for purple
The purple die
Yes
Yes, the purple die
Do we have that
Yeah, Pelagium
Right, relating to the sea
Right, Pelagios in the Greek
We're following the Romans here
Right, sea mussels
Go back to that please
Sea mussels, look at that, sea mussels
Follow the way down the pages to
Roman numer number two
And look at the Pelagium
The purple color
Our Pulaskians
Are originally
Of
The purple
The Phoenicians who take their
Gramata
Who transmit that Gramata
To the Greeks
Are calling themselves
The purple people
Yeah
The purple people
We're talking prehistory
Prehistory
Is where this is coming from
So don't try to tell me
How it is
That some antinomian
Got involved
As he done exist for
Thousands of years
Yeah
Your Christianity and your Judaism
That they've just been
Non-existent
They don't exist, but the
Oracular
Saturnian religion
They're promoting
This
Chance to have
Ionic life
This thing
Is very real and
Very much out of
This old
Prehistoric
People, please, next slide
Wonderful
Egyptians, I see your Egyptian
And I raise you Pulaskian
Pulasgos
Yeah
Look at the under A
Just look at the first word in Greek
Dodonin
Pulasgon
Hadranon
The seat of
Pulaskian Dodonin
Look on the second line down
I told you, Dodonin was big, right?
Look at Turseno
And right away
You say, wait a minute, the Pulaskians
Were the Tursenois
Yes
Yes, wait
I know the Tursenians
Also called
By the Greeks, the Tyrenians
That they were those
People
That the Romans
With their Venus's tongue
Called the Etruscans
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, fantastic
So if you look at Etruscan
You're going to find out
It looks just like the old
Pulaskian
Which scholars
And classical philologies
Have sat around for decades
A century, two centuries
Debating
What the origins of these words
Are
It looks like it's related to Thracian
And trying to trace it
Where it comes from originally
And it always
Goes back through the river of the Mycenaean
Greek
Right, it's one of the places
That it just made its currents
Now, give us another
Mmm, yeah
And Cersei, so coming to
The Etruscans brings us to Italy
And it brings us to Cersei
And Cersei, the daughter of Helius
Hyperion's son, loves steadfast
Odysseus and Borogreus and Latinus
Oh, wait a minute, what?
Latinus?
That has the word Latin in it
Who is faultless and strong
Also, she brought forth
Telaganus
By the will of Golden
Aphrodite, why Golden Aphrodite?
That's a cult title, that's the
Aphrodite who's involved in the production
Right?
And they ruled over the famous Thracians
Nice, next
Next
You see the cult is really
What's pushing and driving everything
And this is the area
You see the Libyans in the south
We have Carthage there
We have Sicily
Where Diodorus happens to be from
And the Terenian
Power here
This is a Pulascian
Power, this is an early power
In the cult, go ahead
Oh, it's gorgeous
Next, please
What are these people?
They're called Tocthon
They're of the Cthon
You don't call their Zeus
A Zeus
You call them a Cthonian
Zeus
Yeah, a Cthonian
Zeus
Yeah, nice that
Cth
Guess what?
Yeah, guess what? It's so beautiful
The language so, it's just like
Amber, it just traps that
It's just a bit of the past
And just kind of keeps it
Preserved for all time
Can never take this stuff away
Next, please
Yeah, Pulascian and Arian Medea
So, let's just look
Next slide
The first Dionysus was the son of
Amun
Yep
And look at this
Little tidbit, right?
Some Georgian scholars
Connect the Pulascians
With the Ibero-Caucasian peoples
Of the prehistoric Caucasus
Now, into the Greeks
As Calkians
Right?
We're going right back
To the Garden
We're going right back
To Edom
Where those four rivers meet
And you're saying, wait a minute
I'm doing this, but I'm doing it
In a way that comes through
The Late Bronze Age
But I know that this is actually
3,000 years previously
Yeah
3,000 to 5,000
Oh my goodness, yes, that's where we are
We're seeing the focus
Come through
That
Medua
Yeah, please
To blow it
To bring the end
Of our
Search
To its culmination, right?
Here we are in the cave
And we've been looking
For that source, for that origin
You thought
You thought that
Adam was a Hebrew name
It is not
It is not
Neither is Eve
And you say, how can you say that?
It's contrary to the last
2,000 years of
Uh-huh
Yes, it is
But it's a fact, let me show you
Chewy, hit him with a chart
This is going to blow your mind
Look at this, look at the linear B
We have the Latin, that's nice
And then we have the Greek
Isn't this gorgeous?
Who is this guy?
Who is the Adamwe?
Right, who is the
Who is the Adamwe?
Who is that
Adam?
So when the
Civilian oracles stand up
And they tell you that Adam
Is Greek
And it was based upon a religious practice
Each of the characters
In his name
Represent the action
Of quartering
Of quartering, if you know
Adam, you can quarter
Right?
It's north, south, east and west
And it goes back through
The bronzes, through
It's captured in the Mycenaean
Linear B
Which is where these people are
It's why Amun is in Crete
Yeah
It's why Amun is in Crete
Gorgeous
Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous
Nothing is the way that you thought
Welcome to Amun's cave
Nothing is the way you thought
I'm offering you
Some of the most beautiful
Distilled reality
That you can possibly make
And it drips
From the ceiling of this cave
Of the
Pulaskians
The place where that virgin
Becomes
The oracle
That's why we're stealing everybody
Yeah, pirates, man
Pirates get dragged into this
Right?
Oh my god, it's gorgeous
Absolutely gorgeous
So, as we're trying to look at
Dragantown, we're trying to see
How to decipher it
We need to get serious about its roots
And we need to see the connection
Between the Orphic letters
The Pulaskian letters
And the performance
Of the mystery
Dionysus is the son of Bacchus
Is the son of Amun
Right?
Bacchus is the son of Amun
Yeah
Yeah
That oracle
Was a Bacchic
Establishment
Kurene
Is not
A native Greek word
Yeah
It turns out it's Pulaskian
So where do we go with the origins
Of
Christianity, which started with
A man getting arrested in a public
Park with a naked boy at 4am
With stuff on his face
Screaming about being thirsty
And no, I'm not a child
Trafficker
How do we get to that
Point?
Through this pathway
Through this pathway
And how are we going to find
This place again
This is our history
Nobody here that doesn't share this
History
This is human history
Yeah
We need to find it
We've got people coming on
Do we have people in the gallery
Tonight?
Yes, we do
We've got Rob
I want to say a few words before we start
In
Where is
The Gnostic Informant
We're waiting for Gnostic Informant
Because he's going to announce something tonight
He's going to announce something
So we'll maybe give him a minute to pop in
Come on, Neil
If you're not going to make your announcement
I'm going to make your announcement for you
But that's, no
I don't want to do that
Let's start off with just a response
To the material that we're talking about
With the Pulaskians
What do you think about
Pulaskians and Dionysus
My favorite part was
Egypt
I read you a Pulaskian
I really like that
I'm going to have to learn how to say Pulaskian correctly
And I'm going to use that one
That was an excellent presentation
Again
I'm going to have to catch up on
You're on fire
You know you're on fire at the minute
And you're hitting as hard with information
Because you know now
There's some way for it to go
A beautiful info on the Orphic
For classmates
I'm sure they'll appreciate that
I kind of like
The Aristaeus part
Because if I'm right
If I remember rightly is the son of Apollo
And
The father of Actaeon
If I remember rightly and that means
Just little bits to me
Just to go all the way back
To each root
In the language
And foresee that in the linear B
Is phenomenal and mind-blowing
And rather conclusive
In my opinion
Fantastic
Fantastic
Snappy, your response
I was really blown away by your lecture
So the Pulasgians are something I've been interested
In a while
So a philosopher I love
Is this guy here, Lydwood Clogges
He wrote a book that I'm reading
Called Cosmogonic Arrows
And he uses the Pulasgians
As an example of sort of
Primordial culture
And like returning to
An original base
For the Bronze Age
And then he connects that with the Bronze Age
Mystery rights in India and in other places
And I just wanted like
There's just so much cool stuff he talks about here
About how the center
Part of the
Pulasgian society was
Almost taking care of the dead
And the rights for the dead
They'd be buried under the stoves and the houses
Right in the center of the home
And everything was centered around
These cycles of death and rebirth
And they would wrap them in purple cloth
It's really powerful stuff
So we're getting somewhere really interesting
Fantastic
Fantastic and
Thonius
Give me your take on tonight
I thought it was amazing
That the Pulasgians
Being the root of the purple
And finding their origin of the language
That the linear being
From what I take it
I think it's amazing
And I think that they might hold the key
To all the ingredients
And how you said that
Father of Dionysus blew my mind
And you said that Kronos
Usurped
Dionysus' first father
And it makes me wonder if
Amen was Orinus
The only Amen that I've read about
Is in the Hermetica
You blew my mind tonight
Fantastic
You have to love
You have to love the fact
That years later
People come along
And take little bits of that
And preserve it
And pass it on
Yeah
And
Let me just ask Thonius
You brought in
Oh
Some psychoanalyst
I think his name was Jung
Jung
You've been looking at some Jung
Does any of this stuff
With Jung at all? What you've been seeing?
Well, from what I've been reading
About Jung is that
He
From what I understand in the red book
It's like he is trying to mimic
What Zeus did
He's trying to go into the abyss
And talk to Nix and to know all things
And it's
It's kind of
It's kind of onto that
No, that's exactly
That's exactly what I meant
He's putting it into
Don't you think he's practicing the mystery?
I mean, he's even getting responses
About the future
And from other people who are telling him
Who are bringing him elements of the future
That are
Shocking him
It's the operation of the mystery
Love it, Snappy
Love it, Thonius
He even said that he got the scepter
He went down there and he pulled out the scepter
From going into the abyss
And talking to the oracle, basically, of night
It's just like Zeus did in the Deverny Papyrus
He tried to...
Yeah, and now the question is
Was he doing that because he was drawing
On that
Reality?
Or was he doing it because he was reading it
And recreating it
Well, we know with the
With the boy that he was talking to
At the
Who was inside
The
Place where they kept
People they didn't want
Running around
For whatever reason
He was talking about
Future, right?
He had never seen the...
He didn't know about the release of this material
He didn't know about
What it meant within ancient religion
Yet it found him
Within a person
Right?
Gorgeous
Snappy
Do we have any
Do you have any impression of the more
Easterly
Working of the Pulaskians
Through Colchis
And through...
Are we getting over? Do you want...
Do you smell India in any of this?
I think you're muted
Oh, definitely
When we're looking at Mycenaean culture
You can compare a lot of this
To what's happening in Harappa
In the Indus Valley
And there's a lot of key things
We're seeing the presence of the bulls
We're seeing
The bull wrestling motif
We're seeing these same horns
In these horned figures
And then we're also seeing
Predominantly is that mother goddess figure
Snakes
And then we know that they're both cultures
Are using cannabis
And they're engaged in this purple trade
Because we have traces of the purple in Harappa
But they're not producing it
So they're getting it from somewhere
Right?
And then there's also these seals
That look a lot similar
So there may be even a connection
Between the Harappan language
And what's going on with the Mycenaean
Gorgeous
And you know, there's so much
Of a frontier there
For people to figure out
To figure out where the influences
Are coming from
How the languages are being pressed
On the civilizations
And you mentioned the snake goddess
Right?
Why is the snake goddess so prevalent?
It seems like a strange thing
But there you go
You have it, right?
And it's gorgeous
The cold
The use of these venoms
Yeah, oh, it's amazing
We'll end up with Rob
Rob, you have the last word
You have the last word
I think somebody's mic is on
If you guys can mute
Rob, you have the last word
You have the last word
I want you to say something, please
About Anastasia
About Anastasia
I was educated as far as I could tell
I was very impressed with
Her abilities
To
Watch the messages as the K-men
As well as engaging
A deep engaging conversation
And to do that take some
She could answer every question
With eloquence and have got
A great deal about it
I just won't go to
The snake goddess though
Because I discovered something
Profound, that you know the snake goddess
Since she's holding the two snakes
That's the image we all see
What I found is
That's the votive
That's the votive to the snake goddess
The snake goddess doesn't
She's the snake goddess
Of course
But she isn't holding two snakes
And I found that very curious
And then I'm going to go to father
So you're the father of Dionysus
And if Anastasia was here
He'd be all over you
Because he thinks
Your name
And you're responsible for
Quite a lot, aren't you?
Through history, so
I'll leave you with them three comments
Alright
You guys heard it here
Thank you for coming
And next week
We're going to bust into
We're going to have our fight club week
Right, so every season
We have one fight club
So there's seven seasons
People have been asking
Is there a beginning and an end to this?
Yes, there is
Believe it or not
It's a narrative, right? It's a song
So
There is
And tonight, next week
Next Friday
We want to have the fight club
So I'm encouraging everybody
Who wants to step up
To say
I am a child of Heracles
And I am unafraid
Of your
Tennessee law
Yes, okay
Thank you guys for coming tonight
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
Just put on
Different masks
And ask the questions that that fella might have
