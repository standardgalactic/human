Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burned to my veins
Indie indos crazy and the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
All that English rhyme, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've gotcha sellin' and you got your drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah, drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah
Welcome back to the Lady Babylon
As you may have noticed tonight, I'm dressed for my date
My date with a Hidna
Now, we're gonna bring Paul along for the sake of entertainment
But for those of you with weak stomachs, you gotta watch out
Paul's one of those types
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him here and we're gonna make that junkie
Answer for himself tonight on Lady Babylon Wednesday night Bible study
I am indeed, and that's for a good reason, you always want to dress to impress, right?
We are going on our journey tonight starting with some comments
I wanna just flash up a couple of comments here just so that we've got some feedback from you
I want you to know, maintaining these connections
Let's bring up our first one, Chewie
This is fantastic, people thank, this is from Stella Luna
I'm just gonna call her Stella Luna
People thank any group of like-minded individuals
Getting together is a cult nowadays
I've noticed some crazy comments on YouTube and I've even seen some crop-up in the lives
I've been watching all the previous streams and I'm pretty much caught up at this point
I'd also like to re-watch because there is so much material and a lot of it is over my head
Like when people comment about almond getting political
And telling him to stay in his lane
That really pisses me off
Everything is political, especially now
The Christ of Fascists are in hyperdrive
And you'd have to be totally asleep at the wheel not to see it
Wow, Christ of Fascists
Christ of Fascists, love that Stella Luna
What a beautiful light you've shown in tonight
That's gorgeous, what a gorgeous comment
For every one of those I just...
I love it, it just fills me with hope
Yeah, fills me with hope, love it
Thank you so much, thank you so much
Let's get it, can we get a negative comment?
No, we didn't have any negative, Chewie says
Necessity is the mother, so invention creation is predetermined
So are we not the children of chaos?
Indeed, we're the sons and daughters and hermaphroditic offspring of the work
Question mark, are we?
Are we?
Look at that
Look at what thought is blazing
This is fantastic, you people are fantastic
I love these, I love these, let's go to one more
Mmm, mmm, mmm, what's that song at the beginning?
Yes, and tonight we'll introduce for your listening pleasure
Zane Campbell, Zane Campbell
This is the man who would save country music
You're talking about royalty
You're talking about country royalty
In the kingdom of the musicians
Yeah, fantastic, and he has been generous enough as you guys have noticed
To let us use him for our intros and our outros
And for any sort of video that we might make
And, I'll have you know, Zane is a monster
He is a monster
And right now, Zane Campbell, for your sakes
For your sakes
Zane Campbell
I'm told
Is considering writing a song for us
A song just for us, just for this channel
And that song, I'm told, will have something to do
With Jesus and a naked boy
Jesus and a naked boy
This is gorgeous, this is gorgeous
So, where can you get in touch with Zane?
Chewie is listed a couple of places
And, uh,
Hang on one second, I want to tell you the
Description Spotify and Bandcamp?
Yeah, okay, fantastic, go to those
Go to those
And look up Zane Campbell
Love him, love him, absolutely love him
Thank you, Zane, for the use of the music to set the ambiance
We love that, people like especially Drinking Whiskey
He seemed to have hit a nerve there, my buddy, from the underworld
This guy's a monster
Love him, okay, let us go, let us go
Right away, let's get on that train
We're about to head out and we set the time machine
We're going, we're going to make a couple of stops
But we're going for that deep dive right into the heart of that ancient mystery
And we're going to have to start with killing, with killing other people
We have to go to a sacrifice in order for this mystery to proceed
Turns out we've got it for you
Let's take a look at the sacrifice clip, can we do that?
Let's go
Let's go
Let's go
Wave continues, the wave continues
We are provided with a holy sacrifice
Thanks to the evangelicals
Thanks to those charismatic
Who reached out to create and mold a society that was not their own
But reached out and in that society planted a hatred
A seed of hatred is so great that it is finally this week
Shown itself for the monster that it is
Welcome to the apocalypse
Yeah, welcome
More death, more sacrifice, it's what gives us the power to continue the mania
You guys asked to up the mania in the pool
And I told you, I take those serious
It's getting hot, it's getting hot
And you're going to have to, you're going to have to be able to discern
What's coming, scientifically
You know these charges are being handed down at a very specific time
So we have to pursue them with the utmost diligence
We have to call in the right witnesses and tonight we've got Paul
So I welcome my guest Akidna
I welcome her and I have to give her the place here
Because tonight we're going to really be dining with her
We're going to be dining with her
And Paul, yes, yes I know, I know it's Latin
Just ignore them, Paul, take a seat, take a seat Paul
I want you to tell me what you know Paul
I want you to tell me what you know about the right
I want you to tell me what you've been on
And where you've been Paul
We know what's going on Paul
I just want you to get it off your chest
There has to be some good cop
After all, trying to set a good impression tonight
Can we go to some Greek?
I want to bring us our first Greek tonight
This comes right out of a tragedy
And that tragedy is centered around
Take it down, that tragedy is centered around her
She is such a fury
She's the one who makes it so that decay can exist in the cosmos
Decay is justice
Imagine that guardian of justice
Guardian of justice, that's who we're with
Wow, this is primal stuff
This is stuff that the Olympians look back on
Knowing their foundations lie back there
Yeah, this is fantastic
Let's bring her up
Speaking in a place that would establish the courts
Where decay herself would be queen
It says once a man's blood has run into the sand
There is no resurrection
What is that resurrection?
Where are we? Oh my god, we're hundreds of years too early
We went too far back
We landed right in the lap of the stage
Where the Bacchic revelry is coming down to find a landing pad
Those devil's wings that you're on
They bring you to this place
To this tragedy
And here we have the great and terrible echidna
In all her fury
Bringing us the establishment of justice through the cup
Oh, this is gorgeous
This is elusis
Oh, this is that place
Can we go on? What does it say about her?
I just want to, before we sit down
I want her to know exactly who she is
And what she's here for
That last term, anastasis
Some of you will jump
And maybe get a little feeling somewhere in your body
A little tickle
And you will say, oh my goodness
He's talking about the resurrection
He is
He is
He's talking about the mystery
Fantastic, Paul
Get over here, where's that tiny little something
Right, did you hear that?
Right there, come here
Come here, you druggy
Did you guys know Saint Paul was a druggy?
Did you know he was one of the biggest druggies in the whole book?
Yes, he's out there
John gave him a run for his money
John gave him a run for his money, right?
That's not his middle finger, is it?
Was that his middle finger?
Oh, wow, okay, I told him take it easy, right?
Take it easy
This is the guy, Paul, let's just do it, people
Let's just do it
Look, good cop's gone
Paul, show me your arm
Where did you get those two puncture wounds?
Ah, it was a...
You say it was some kind of viper, the bitcha
And, yeah, like, yeah, really?
No problems? Yeah, no problems
You got no problems with that, huh?
You just walked it off, you just shook it off, literally
Wow, okay, fantastic, Paul
Fantastic, that does it
Now, tell us, Paul, what you been shooting up?
What you been shooting up?
Because you've been saying some of the craziest stuff going
We've got it here, look
Look, here it is, Paul
Can you see? Can you see it's all recorded in this book?
We got your letters, we got your letters
Bring up that letter
Okay, state's evidence, bring it up
Yep
Next, there we go
Paul, you're recorded as writing this
Pheos under whose power
You project this mystery
You proclaim that it's under the authority
Of that resurrection from the dead
Is that correct?
Is that the right that we're talking about, Paul?
Resurrection from the dead?
Yeah, you know it is, shut up
Yeah, let's keep going
We got more, Paul, we got more
A couple of things you said here, I just want you to...
Yeah, go ahead, just keep going straight down
Yep, yep, there we go
You were also reportedly
Telling people that this Gnostic thing
Has been brought out of the invisible
Out of the invisible cosmos
Into the visible world
Is that right, Paul?
Is that right?
You got something coming down the pipe force
So what is associated with the Ophites?
Here you're seeing, right?
Associations, vocabulary
He's using vocabulary that the Ophites are using
You know what those Ophites are doing?
Those serpents, guess what they're doing
With that hot purple
Yeah, with that hot purple
They are writing vapors
That take them to places that you can't go
You can't go, tell us, Paul
Tell us about writing those vapors, you junkie
Bring it up, bring it up, let's get him
Let's get him, we got another source
We got another source up here
Next one, oh my goodness, yay, okay
Here you are, buddy, you know you said this
Right, you're going to be talking about those visions
Those visions and those apocalypses
Those things that are reviewed
That are brought, renewed back into your vision
And those things are coming from Curios, aren't they?
Yeah, they are
Tell us, Paul, do you know anybody, Paul?
Now I'm going to quote him to you directly
I know a man, I know a man in Christ
14 years now
Whether this dude in body, I don't know
Or out of body, I don't know
Does this, only God knows
Really, and tell us, what do you go through
When you're under the juice, what do you go through?
Bring it back up
This dude gets grabbed and pulled off to what?
The third uranos
Now, those of you who are going to step back
You have been mesmerized by the Maseratic tradition
And the King James, ho, ho, ho, ho
Yes, King James
King
Look what you did
Look what you did to these people
Look what you did
They're going to try to inject something here
That's not from the original
This is uranos we're talking about
Paul is being kicked up to uranos
Now notice here
At this point in the interrogation
That we're about to play
Paul gets nervous
Almost as if he's a little bit
You know how they are when they come off it?
Yeah, when they come off it
They're all like, forgetful
You know what I mean?
Their eyes roll
They do that thing where they're looking up
These bakans, right?
We know who they are
Let's keep going
Bring back that same giant testimony that he's got there, Chewie
Last big Greek text
Look at this, people
Weather and body are mine
Outside of body, I don't know
But this guy was snatched up to the third uranos
And I know this man
Weather and body
Yeah, we're out of body
I don't know
But he was snatched into paradise
And he heard the areta remata
Which is not right for men to say
Pull out
He heard the what, you junkie
He heard the what, you guys saw it
Last time we were here, we were in the Mithraic Rite
And you saw it, they saw it
Kidna, they saw it, right?
You were in the Rite
And you realize the vision
You've made what is invisible visible
Fantastic, fantastic
And what is the specific experience that you've experienced?
So for those of you who've been detained by the hippies
For those of you who've been sidetracked
By those who lack discipline
Yeah, we're not talking about love and having a good time
We aren't, yeah
We're talking about hearing that which is not repeatable
Yeah, the good stuff
The remata
What are remata, you say?
What are remata?
Remata are what the purple gives us, baby
Oracles
You want to sit here and have dinner with me tonight?
Kidna?
I'm going to have to have an oracle
I'm going to have to have it because having you here
Without fulfilling your purpose
Would be the greatest crime of history
I want you to sing
Yeah
How is Paul?
We got one more question for this guy
Right?
Big one
How are you getting it, buddy?
How are you getting access to the kingdom of Satan?
How are you getting it?
Who has given you the salvation that is kicking you up
To the third uranos
Which we all know is the place that your daddy
That's your daddy
Your holy daddy, Paul
We know it's your holy daddy who's behind it all
You kicked up to that place
How are we going to get there, Paul?
Tell us, bring back the text one more time
He'll tell us
Squeeze him
Love him
I love to squeeze him
Look at that last line
Edote moi
Skolops
And she loved that word Skolops
Skolops tesarki
Angelo satana
Wait, what did he just say?
I heard him say Satan, right?
Did everybody hear him say Satan?
Yeah, he was given a what?
A Skolops
What's a Skolops?
Did somebody pick it up?
There was an evidence bag with that thing
Bring us the Greek here for Skolops
No, no, we're not there
I think it's probably near the very end
Skolops
Just keep going people
Don't worry, this is all evidence, right?
Some of them may put things together better and quicker
You know what I mean? Let's do this one
Bump
No, that's up, go up
There we go, one more
Oh my goodness, this is terrible
What a terrible...
Look for my Skolops
That thing is somewhere around here
The flesh eating
We don't need the flesh eating right now
We don't need the crazy looks
We don't need the rolling in the eyes
It's really cool to actually watch that happen
We need the Skolops
There we go
My God
Nice save, Chewie
Look at this, anything
Pointed
Especially a pale
A pole
Is it a pole pale?
It's kind of steak
Steak, anything pointed
The Skolops is what pierces you
It's what pierces you
That's why you see that number two
Thorn
Thorn
Not just any kind of thorn
Not just any kind of thorn in your flesh
But what kind of thorns are they using here?
Look at Armoredale
Skolop has foiny costs
Foiny costs let those of you with ears to hear
Take it down
Let those of you with ears to hear
Hear it and see it
Right?
Wonderful
This thorn in your flesh, Paul
That we still have in evidence
What does it make you do?
It's what?
It's what?
It's a messenger
It's a messenger
It's a mess of solace
Give you gotta do it right
Do it at all
What do you say louder?
Messenger
Messenger
Messenger
Gives him a messenger
What kind of messenger, Paul?
Satan
Satan
Look, bring it up one more time
Greek
What's this junkie telling us?
Nope, not that one
The other one where he says Satan
The last Greek text
I'm gonna bring that one
Nice
Angelo satana
Yeah
He has a thorn
In his sarks
You know what we're gonna do with Kidna?
I know that you're hungry
And that you eat flesh
I know that you do
I know that there is a thorn
With purple
The burns
The burns and it comes out
Right out of a Kidna
Comes right out of your ancestry
Comes right out of the Scythians
The Arimoi
Comes right out of them, doesn't it?
Those bald, shaved, headed, dead dude people
Walking around with their cannabis
Taking vapor baths
We're gonna even bathe
You know what we do?
We sit in the smoke of the cannabis
Isn't that nice?
That's amazing
That's an amazing group
It's from these family members of yours, Kidna
That we bring out those most potent poisons
That we're involved with in the right
The ones that give you the kick
The ones that are there
That Jesus is walking around saying
If you follow me
Right?
Come
Look, it's a little boy with me
Right?
If you come with me
You can take this snake venom
Won't bother you at all
Yeah
Won't bother you at all
Why do we need the Kidna?
Because she is the one who assaults Uranus
With the blood of her beloved Typhon
And what does Typhon do?
Typhon cuts the Neura from Zeus
Typhon cuts the Neura from the one
Who sits on the Thron
In Uranus
Thronus
Po Thronon, Pharmacon
Yeah
Fantastic
Let's get another text
Let's bring Kidna to full view
So that we can complete ourselves
What does she do?
This Kidna is Lugre
And she is Kubokhthon
Right?
And she sits there
With the Arrimans
The Arimoi
And what does she do?
They're also called by the way
That's a tribe of Scythians, right?
It's a tribe of Scythians
I should have said that
And these people are what?
What are these people?
Sometimes
They're called those who live on the extreme
Right?
They're the ones who are there at the edge
Right?
Right at the edge of reality
They're also called Khmerians
Right?
These Arrimoi are the ones who are bringing you
The purple
And what does it say about a Kidna?
What is she doing?
She is brought
She is brought up, right?
From the Chthonian place where she dwells
Where she lives
Where she inhabits
She is a what?
Who are you, Kidna?
You're a Numfe
You're a Bride
An Athanatos Numfe
An immortal Bride
What kind of an immortal Bride?
And when I say Bride
Pull it down for one second
Everybody know
We've got to get the right images here
If we don't tune in
There's no reason for a Kidna to be here
Right?
We've got to get the exact right images
And the exact right image is for her, the Numfe
You're talking Juliet
You're talking somebody who is just entering a marriageable age
And she is Athanatos
She is immortal
She is immortal
And what else does she do?
She never ages
She never ages
You can take these Medusa
Medea has 12 of them
12 of these Scythian Medusa
Now imagine this
This is the most romantic
Right?
This is why I got dressed up
Is because I wanted to paint that picture
For you of the
Medusa who is a foot
A head, excuse me
A head taller than the tallest man
Muscular physique
Appearing to be about 12 years old
You know
Excuse me
What else?
Kind of rough skin
A little bit of skin condition
Sensitive to the light
A little aggressive
A little aggressive
Very physical
Very physical
Unafraid
She puts her drugs in her hair
She puts her drugs in her hair
And if that stuff touches you
It'll turn you to stone
Yeah
Love it
Love it
Let's bring up another text for her
What else can you tell us about Kidna?
Right?
So her mother gave birth to her
When she did
It was Peloron Amechanon
It was a prodigy
It was a miracle Amechanon
An irresistible
Impenetrable
Unavoidable miracle
She wasn't like mortals
She wasn't like gods
She lived in a cave
Her power was drawn
She is the god
Thein
Ehidnan
Half of her is that numfe
Helikopida
Nymph who is
Helikopida anime eyes
Helikopida anime eyes
Yeah
And what else is she chewing?
I just want to get
I know you're trying to get those animal eyes
The gang is quick tonight
I don't know why
Okay, here we go
Here she is
And she is half that
Fantastic
Half of that
Prodigy
Snake
Terrible thing
Great
And Iolan
That means the sparkling
Have you ever seen a snake?
If you look at
Ehidna from the waist down
If you look at her from the waist down
She has that sheen
That those scales get
When they give off that reflected light
And it's prism
They have that sheen
That's what her skin is like
Isn't that nice?
But keep going on our description
Let's see what else
What would you like for dinner?
Ehidna
What would you like for dinner?
This is she who starts the mystery
I need you to understand that
She is
Omestin
Zathes
She is
The flesh eater
For those of you who didn't know
You were an abacchic rebel
Now you do
Now you do
Yeah, okay
She's the one we saw her
Right?
She's the one
She is, she's approaching
And now we know
That we have this junky St. Paul
AKA St. Paul
We know that we have an avenue
To get to that iraculous place
Yeah, this is fantastic
We're closing in
As you can see, Jesus' operation
In Toto
Yes
Its sophistication
Is, I know, trans-dimensionally alarming
I get that, I get that
And that's why we have things
Like we have
Right now
If you can bring the past
And the future into the present
You know you've done it
You know that a kidna
Will smile
Yeah, you know that half
Viper
Will smile
Okay, bring us one more
I want to take us back
We've got a couple more texts
I want you guys to see this
Yeah, go ahead, let's bring up that one
This is an email from a student of mine
And I didn't put any identifiers
For the student
But I wanted you to notice something here
I want you to notice in the middle
Of this email is some Greek
Sabazion, gun, et cetera, et cetera
You see, musterion
This person is throwing
Greek at me
And he says with regards to
Sabazius being mentioned in class
Earlier today
I did find the reference to the
Expression, dragon, and the breast
My English translation of
Clemens Petrepticus reads
The deity gliding over the breast
For the token of the
Sabazian mysteries to the initiated
However, however you like that
However, I love that
Look, this person
From learning the instrument
Of the Greek can now go
And tell the people at Harvard
To stick it in their ear
Yes, stick it in your ear, people
Stick this in your ear
Look, sabazion, gun, musterion,
Sumbulon, toys
Mu, us, menois
Ho dia colpu theos
The god is in the end
Ho dia colpu theos
What kind of god is this?
The god dia colpu
And the translation for this
Terrible. What's it literally
Saying here? This is the god
Who comes through the colpus
The colpus, as this intrepid
Student noted below, is the vagina
That dark harbor. Do you know how
The users of the burning purple
Are referring to the cup
From which they drink? It's the dark
Harbor. Yeah, it's her
She is that source
You wonder why Jesus sat there
You can take a dump. You wonder
Why Jesus sat there and was like
Hey, you gotta eat my flesh
Drink my blood, right?
And you're sitting there wondering
You're listening to your pastor
For the 50th time is preaching on it
Usually it has something to do
With the sins of the people
And the forgiveness and the washing
And the redemption
Yes, how great thou art
How great thou art
Now you can see that it's much
More than that. That's a phony
World. That world never even existed
It's a figment of your modern
Imagination because your glasses
Your glasses only work
Your glasses only work for the middle
Ages. Yeah, okay, okay
I'm not going to waste your time
I'm not going to waste your time
I want to get to it and I want to get to the end
But I wanted you to see that God
Coming through the culprits
Yeah, the dragon
The dragon within the breast
Yeah, and now you wonder about Mary Magdalene
Everybody loves to talk about Mary Magdalene
And I just like to kick down the doors
And take Mary back. I'd like to take her back
From the pimps and academics
From the Anglicans
And from the people who tried to purify
And clarify, cleanse Mary
Who was walking around with sex drugs
Expensive sex drugs
Expensive sex drugs
Do you know we can drink
We can drink her contents
After she...
Am I back? Yeah
I think Mickey Mouse ran in the room
And turned off the switch or something
No, we can look at Mary
And we can look at her original being
And we can look at her cathartic work
And her magic, right?
But what we're focusing on now
Is we are supposed to go back with Jesus
To that place in Uganda
Where homosexuality is a capital offense
It's a capital offense
Yeah, yeah
We're beginning, we're beginning
For those of you who don't think
That you can see the future
Where this activity that we're talking about
Takes us
Those of you who don't realize this is your future
You are all Uganda
Yeah
Thank again, because it always happens
And the mortals are like, oh my goodness, I'm surprised
Right? And everybody's running around
Mass destruction
Things have fallen apart
Society's gonna decide, hey
I think I'll take a couple thousand years break
Yeah, I think I'll take a couple thousand years break
Well, this time we have the tools
This time we have the tools to do it the right way
Right? They need this apocalypse
Christians, right? They need it
Anybody who follows the irracular divinity
Jehovah, they need this
They need this event
Yeah, why? They don't realize it
It's based on things that were around when they weren't
But that's how we are, isn't it?
That's what I tell the watchers
I'm like, dude, okay, I know
They're gonna be surprised again, right?
They're gonna be surprised again
But there's nothing we can do about it
There's nothing we can do about it
Because we're not here for them anyway
We're here for Eve, right?
We're here for Eve
I want to leave you with the impression
There is an ideal out there
That we can reach toward
That you can take the human experience
And you can tune it
You can tune it to create a sphinx
You can tune it to create she
Who can tell you past and future all at present
You can tune that world
It's in the genes
It's in the nature
It's inherent
All we have to do is follow
Follow
Yeah, yeah, yeah
There's a Nobel for the next person
Who realizes the applications
And realizes just what exactly they were doing in antiquity
When they were making these, you know, tiny computers
They figured out movements of the stars
Stuff like that, right?
Yeah
Where have you been lately?
Say the watchers
Trust me, guys
I'm always gonna be
I'm always gonna be running interference
But we're right there
We have to bring this investigation
It's gotta come
Beautiful
Did you want to post something?
That's okay, fantastic
Right, I want everybody to know that
We appreciate the fact that
The matrix of justice
Is still venerable
Is still venerable
We can still look to Lady Justice
And say that
That's who I want to be with
Yeah, yeah
And still bring her back
It's the constant hope
It's a constant hope
And if she doesn't come back
Christians don't get what they want anyway, right?
So, because she has to offer the cup
And et cetera, et cetera
Next time we're gonna look at Jesus
Right down there with him on his level
We're gonna confront him about the drugs
And the confusion when he's stumbling around the garden
We're gonna try to go to the toxicology
We're gonna get a report from the guys who arrested him
What was his blood alcohol, right?
No problem, that's the kind of evidence
We're gonna be presenting
Thank you everybody for coming
And thank you most importantly to Echidna
For always being there
In the back of our human consciousness
Thank you for always being there
Yeah, it's almost like you're just right over my shoulder
You know what I mean? Love it
Hail Satan
Drink and whiskey
