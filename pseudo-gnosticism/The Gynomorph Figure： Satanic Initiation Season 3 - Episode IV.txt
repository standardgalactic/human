I never meant anything I said, just spitting it up
Everything I've been feeding, keeping from eating away at me
Never said anything I meant, I never said the letters that I should have said
So it's asking too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows
When I say, never was the cause for a long
Never knew what I was talking about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, it's good to see you again
You can see at the start of this satanic initiation
I've already got my glasses on
Which means we're going to jump right into some text
And hopefully hit you with some images to bring you to that place
Where you can see those deep things, those deep things of Satan
Nice, nice
Tonight on Lady Babylon we'll be taking a look at hermaphrodites
We'll be taking a look at the worship of them
And why that is the source of Christianity
I wanted to give you just a little portrayal tonight of what I've encountered
And I want to give you a little background
We're going to be looking at a source tonight
That I've gotten the permission of the author
Which is me
And we're going to go through a little bit of hermaphrodite's guide of Morse and Jesus
Just a bit of the intro and a little commentary, a little running commentary on it
So think of it as a way for an author to be able to tell you what's behind the text
For those of you with ears to hear
Fantastic
I want to start tonight
I want you to settle in and I want you to take a look at religion
Religion is a wormhole
It is a multi-dimensional collapsible bridge in space
That only a 13-year-old girl in the bloom of life can open
And only when she has entered a state of height and sexual arousal
When I started writing this
I was privileged to be able to work with an editor who is just an outstanding author
He had been looking at my writer, outstanding writer
He had been looking at my work
And the chemical muse had come out with Macmillan
And he wanted to be able to bring the material to the public without all of the footnotes
So he said we're going to incorporate our quotations within the text to drive it forward
So that people aren't taking it back because I had a tendency to overly...
You know, academically trained
You always want to put your footnotes down and your sources
So this is an attempt to bridge that gap
Yeah
According to ancient Etruscan symbols
The teenage priestesses who established the norms for much of Roman culture
Religion is a method of cosmic tunneling
It's a practice that creates a fluid structure
Through which dark matter breathing beings
Can travel in order to possess their maddened devotees
The ancient world believed religion was a resonant span across the fabric of space-time
And ancient clerics thought that its thermodynamic seal could be forcefully broken open
With the songs of maidens
People are always talking about what religion is
And when we look at religion and antiquity
We're looking through our modern lens
Christianity of antiquity is nothing even remotely similar to what you see today
So when we're looking at texts that have to do with strange concepts
We have to be careful, we have to be very literate
We have to insist upon a scientific approach
This is all from reason, right?
The Romans spoke classical Latin
Their word religio
From which we derive our English word religion
Means ligature or binding
This is important
Religion is not what you think it is
Modern historians, overly influenced by their own Christian cultural lens
Have interpreted this to mean religion
Is something that binds us to do and to say certain things in celebration of divinity
In other words, religion is what we owe the god or the gods
Nothing could be further from the historical actuality
Let's get out and taste the air a little bit
In Rome, religio was simply the cosmic tie that bound the earth plane to the rest of the multiverse
It was a means to an end
It was a force of extra-dimensional attraction
Yeah, yeah
Let's talk about demons
Let's talk about demons
I want you to be getting in the place of the ancient practitioner
The importance of demons
The ancient Mediterranean world taught the priestesses, witches, diviners, and poets
Possessed the ability to open portals
Through which sentient powers or demons who inhabited extra-worldly planes
Could travel to the material universe
These beings, these powers that be, did not have a physical form
And remember, we can go through all of the scientific texts
We can go through all the Aristotle you want
We can go through all the... talking about Democritus
We can go through all the traditional Greek ways of learning
To support what this is saying
Are you ready?
These beings, these powers that be, did not have a physical form
They were not composed of atoms
They were not composed of atoms, the indivisible elements of our world
That's ancient, it's not modern
And they did not have eyes, ears, mouths, voices, or in fact any human or biological attribute at all
And perhaps most importantly, these immortals were neither male nor female
They were neither, and they were both
In the Greco-Roman way of thinking, gods are the cosmic bloom of existence
Which only makes sense, right?
It only makes sense that divinity would be that moment at which the perfection is displayed
Yes, you see how everything goes back to Aphrodite? Love it
In the Greco-Roman way of thinking, gods are the cosmic bloom
Greek and Latin culture, preserved in the amber of ancient literature
Perpetuated the view that gods are the immortal elements of an ordered and living universe
They are the elements of an ordered and living universe, the Orphics
Prayed to that cosmos, that organization which they called Fusus
Nature, nature
And you see right away why Paul the Apostle is so angry
Running around saying, stop worshiping nature
Get your mind off of nature, because even the Christians who had entered the cult
Were still influenced by their upbrings, by their education
Yeah, and if they didn't have any of that, they had what was in the ether around them
Myth was the medium in which the classical world expressed the efflorescence of the immortal forces of the universe
Greek and Roman myth had an extraordinary influence on ancient artists, statesmen, religious leaders, and philosophers
It was a cultural cement that facilitated the construction of democracy
The establishment of a system of education and the creation of what became the scientific method
Ancient myth was a metaphor for expressing the individuality and actions of the immortal powers that govern the universe
There was no difference between their philosophers and their physicists
There was no difference
The doctors had to stand on both sides of that divide
The doctors had to know the pharmacology, they had to know which drugs did what
But they also had to know the theories that Galen goes into ad nauseam
Yes, the medical theories and the medical powers, the powers of things
So a lot of this talk about demons fits right in with their religion, which is very different
When you talk about a mystery and the performance of a mystery and antiquity
You're talking about a specific event for which you cannot create a proper representation using modern terms
You can't, you have to go there
The goal is the orgasm
And you say, wait a minute, what? I didn't think church had anything to do with orgasm
Right, that's why they threw out Aphrodite
They severed that connection within the mystery and from that point on, you have a terrible enslavement of the feminine
It's gorgeous, I want to read you one, another section here, I'm going to skip ahead
I just want to read to you about the bi-gendered god
The bi-gendered god, the gyneomorph was a bi-gendered god with both masculine, physical and feminine attributes
The word itself is just a pairing of gyna, woman and morph shape
Literally a gyneomorph is a god with female shape
Additionally, the gyneomorph was a developed or evolved state of feminine divinity or daimon, demon in English
Gyneomorphs were portrayed as effeminate young males like Dionysus
These are the ones they're outlawing in China right now, right? They're trying to get rid of effeminate males
I hope that this YouTube live is banned in Tennessee, I hope it's banned in Tennessee
Gyneomorphs retain the creative capacity of their feminine forms
They had cosmic wombs, but they also possessed the inseminating abilities attributed to the masculine god
Gyneomorphs were special because they stood in the gender gap between male and female gods
Gyneomorphs formed a bridge between the sexes, they were a combo, or the sum, of both genders
In this way, gyneomorphs were hermaphroditic and could appear sometimes as predominantly masculine or other times as predominantly feminine
The gyneomorph was an important figure in ancient culture
Because the Greco-Roman world, and I'm going to say something that's going to shock you and you're not going to believe until I show you examples
Or until you find examples and come back to me and say, you're right
The Greco-Roman world possessed no word for gender
They also didn't possess a word for homosexuality
That's a later creation, it's only when you persecute something, can you name it and identify it
If something is not persecuted, it doesn't need to be identified, it's just part of society
And that's how the Greeks were, you remember Achilles?
There's no question that he was involved with men and women
There's no reference to what that ism is, it doesn't exist
I'll give you a clue though, the Christians created one
The monotheistic religions always come up with a way
With the way of taking that group of people and defining them and vilifying them
They throw drug users in there with them, that's the way it is
Lovely universe you've got, say those who are watching
They viewed sex not as a binary proposition but as a natural sum of two cooperative potentials
Isn't that interesting? Yeah, it's not binary, it's not binary at all
Yeah, right, nice, it's a range, it's a scale which makes sense because the Greeks were such students of balance
Such students of balance, that was mesmerizing, thanks for that video
In their view sexual attributes were a combination of both masculine and feminine qualities
There were no absolute sexual characteristics or combinations for this reason
Their closest word to English gender is kind
That's about the closest you can get, kind
Yeah, fantastic
What are the origins of necromancy? What does this have to do with necromancy?
Because that's why everybody's come here is to get involved in necromancy, right?
So at least that's what you seem to be reflecting
The earliest origins of Western necromancy are found in the practices of Etruscan priestesses and prophets
These wates or seers were able to divine the future based on their reading of natural signs
They believed cosmic intelligences freely communicated with mortals
And they thought that proper interpretation of signs like lightning strikes and the flight of birds
Was the provenance of specialized clerics
These same clerics worship gynomorphic gods, there we are, there's the connection
And perpetuated myths of bi-gendered divine entities
Necromancy was extremely popular during birth and early development of Christianity
Raising the dead was a common practice of Roman and Greek religious figures
And was a well-established ritual by the time Jesus entered the stage of Western history
Necromancers perform sacred sexual acts meant to summon and drive out demons from the afflicted
Sacra pigiacchia is the Latin term, so for those of you who say
I need a source and I need, there's an actual, you don't get better evidence than this
An actual word in Latin for sacred sodomy
Think about that for a minute
This is not unusual because in Roman weddings, when your 14-year-old girl is marrying a 30-year-old ex-veteran
It's traditional for her to be able to offer the anus as an alternative to vaginal penetration
It's a courtesy because it's a scary process
And the Romans thought it was, it should be up to her to choose
And when she's ready, she will offer the other
But until then, just, you know, yeah, that's the way it's going to be
And St. Augustine hated this, he hated it, he was so much against this practice, right?
And he said they go up during the wedding and they sit, they sit on the phallus, they sit on the priapus
Yeah, it was, as soon as you can call them sodomites, you've got it
You've got a group that you can latch on to and you can burn the city down for
Right, isn't that what we all desire as first-century Christians?
We've got to burn down Rome, that's what they said
People now are calling for civil war, right?
This happens through history
There are forces that call for the decline, for the toppling of the government
And the Romans, the Romans fought that force, they fought it hard
They pushed for civilization, they pushed for it
And it was only, it was only when the Christians took the extra step
Everybody, everybody, I'm telling you, I've been reading these texts a long time
And everybody thinks the fairy tale is the actuality
They think the Romans are walking around with their gale, oh, and stomping around their uniforms
Putting people on crosses, throwing people to the tigers
Yeah, letting people get killed
You know, the only time they took on the Christians and put them in the arena with other criminals
Is when they stood against the government
When they stood against the government, right?
They didn't care who Jesus was
They didn't give anything, this was some backwater province
That was way out of control, that had no tradition
That even came close to what the Romans considered civilization
And these people don't have toilets, brah
They don't have toilets, right?
Much less, how do you get there? The roads are terrible
They got no administration, they got nothing, their courts are terrible
You can be stoned by a crowd of people
This is hillbilly world, right?
This is, they didn't care about it
So-and-so, the greatest king of the world, they didn't care about that, right?
It's when the Christians stood against the government
When the insurrection started, right?
When the violence started, right?
And that inevitably was catapulted everybody forward
In time to a place where the Romans get swamped
And there's people who try to stop it along the way
There's intellectuals, there's people who are government people
Who try to stop it, see if we can keep this insurrectionist mood out
Right? Preserve the republic
You don't go in and defecate on the statue of the republic
Wild animals, yeah, yeah
Those are the ones you feed to the tigers
Right? Thomas Jefferson got this
Thomas Jefferson got this when he said you have to take
The leader of the insurrection, that tyrant
And you gotta sacrifice him to liberty
You gotta sacrifice him, if you don't, justice doesn't stay with you
She leaves, and once justice leaves your society, you're done for
You're done for
Those are classical ideas
Classical ideas
Yeah, I want to continue with the origin of necromancy, I'm sorry
The purpose of ancient western religion was to open a means of communication
With the realms of the gods
Classical necromancers practice their religion by opening portals to the kingdom of the dead
The oldest symbols, the earliest western prophets
And these are the symbols of the Vatican Hill, baby
These are the real ones, the ones who are saying
Listen up, and your source here is John Littis
They're saying, listen up
We're going to tell you all of history
They're like, what?
We're going to tell you all of history
We're going to show it to you, it's going to be so shocking
It's going to be so accurate that you're going to want to keep it in a vault
You're going to want to keep it in a treasury
Yeah, serious stuff
All of them women
Moses is bound to the Iraqi tradition
Otherwise he wouldn't be holding up a serpent on a pole
He wouldn't have a tent full of clouds, they got to put a rope on your leg
You say, when you're going to the temple, that's weird
Isn't that weird? Because they're going to have to pull you out
If you collapse, right? With everything that got on the altar
What do you think you burn on altars? Not on meat, right?
Lots of drugs and antiquity, lots of drugs
The oldest symbols, the earliest western prophets
taught that the resurrection or summoning of the gods from the underworld
was a necessary step in restoring justice to the universe
You have the final judgment, and some of you will talk about the final judgment
See the Christ, the Christians will talk very pompously
Yes, judgment seat of Christ, I'm a dominionist
pre-tribulationalist, millennialist, master-patorious, maximus
It's just so much humiliating, circle-jerkery
That's performed, theologians love it
But this idea of this judgment was because, and you'll love this people
is because the generation of iron, they called us
They called us the generation of iron
The last god, says the Greek mind, the last god to leave mortals
Justice
She left the generation of iron
Because she saw that she had no place
She was the last god to leave
She hung in there as long as she could
But as soon as you say, what happened?
What happened to the justice system?
Money happened to the justice system
Money happened to the justice system
And those Greeks knew, as soon as you get money, you get the corruption of democracy
You get the corruption of democracy
Those gods that help protect you, like Athena Nikkei
The virgin we all protect
That virgin democracy
Justice, we all protect justice
We all want to preserve justice
If we don't sacrifice to justice, we're not going to keep our society
That's it, and we're going to be hit with things
That we don't have the defenses for
This is why we call those gods here
It's why we have these specific gods
Remember, the Christians were first called atheists by the pagans
Because they said, you have no gods, you have no justice
How can you not worship Nikkei?
We don't worship any god, but this one dude who's going to come back and slaughter you all
That was the creative faith
Imagine that as a creative faith
And if you don't think that modern day evangelicals think the very same thing
You're fooling yourself
There are people around you who are waiting for your slaughter
It's just a matter of time
I got one bit of bad news
Devils only give me five more minutes
I've got one bit of bad news for the evangelicals in the group
The Catholics may or may not care
But the evangelicals, I need to let you know there is no resurrection
There is no rapture
The word in Greek that you have mistaken for rapture is apostasy
Yeah, let that sink into a minute
Those of you who are talking to the evangelicals now
Those of you who are looking for the rapture
Those of you who are looking for it
There isn't one
There is no word for rapture
There isn't
It's the word apostasy
There has to be a falling away
There has to be a falling away
The root
The root is the love of money
Says justice, right?
Long established before Jesus did
Long established, yeah
Look at yourselves
Look at yourselves
Love it
I wanted to read you about what is gender
Because it's become such an important concept
In a chapter I wrote called Sexual Transformations
Yeah, oldest of the prophets
She lifts her hands to the heavens
And prays to receive a penis
That is from the Pripyah
The oldest of prophets
She raises her hands
Yeah, raises her hands
Interesting, beautiful
But I'm not going to go there
I just want you to know
Generations of irons are only
Generations of iron
Because they have lost justice
I will rule you with the rod of iron
Says the cross-dressing Jesus
And yeah, yeah, look it up
Jesus in the apocalypse
Is wearing women's lingerie
Yeah, very sexy lingerie
It's part of the kit of Aphrodite
It's gorgeous
Thank you, Jesus, for bringing that
Thank you for bringing that morning star
Most of you think the morning star
Is a male
Right, Lucifer and Lucifera
Lucifer and Lucifera, yeah
I think we've reached a pleasant point
I want to just, by way of notes
I won't be available later tonight
But everything in the classes
Seems to be progressing accordingly
We'll have a good class tomorrow
A good Greek class tomorrow
Everybody keep reading your sources
Don't forget a little Oscar Wilde
The supplement of little Euripides
Every once in a while
And don't be afraid
I gave an interview earlier today
And I sensed a fear in the air
I sensed a real fear
That was only balanced by the courage
Of a whonastic informant
Who doesn't want
Who doesn't want to do anything
But bring the reality
Bring the reality
Yeah, thankfully there are those people out there
And let's honor the muse
And let's bring this
Now, we're going to take a step up
And we're going to start with the cup
We're going to start making the cup
So I'm very much looking forward to our next meeting
Thank you very much for coming tonight
I appreciate your time
Thank you, Chewie, for all the help
And everybody, Hail Satan
When I say never met nobody
No harm when I say
Never was a cause for a long
Maybe you'll understand
What I meant something
Maybe I won't do
Just put on different masks
And ask the questions
