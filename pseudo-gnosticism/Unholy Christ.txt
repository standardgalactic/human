You're gonna love it
Hail Satan, get your sum
Poisonous venom cup
Hot purple, sip it up
That girl you know you love
Satanic initiation
In the park
After dark
Creepy stuff
In the garden of Gethsemane
Accomplices, prostitutes
And accountants
Where the necromancers hang out
And get high
With Lady Babylon, no doubt
Purple facial
Of seashells, semen
Opients in adrenal chrome
The dark lord of Saturn
Satan's palimpsest
An eerie tale of sinister doom
Hail Satan, get your sum
Poisonous venom cup
Hot purple, sip it up
That girl you know you love
Hail Satan, get your sum
Poisonous venom cup
Hot purple, sip it up
That girl you know you love
Hail Satan, get your sum
Poisonous venom cup
That girl you know you love
Babylon

To profane it all
Get ready to bring it out
I have got to warn you tonight

Tense up
It'll make you tense up like that
Some smooth muscle action
It's going to make you tense up

You're going to love it tonight
I get to take you to a place
A lot of people don't get to access this
Right
What's he doing
He's bringing us into the mood
Well, the ship
Takes us there
In time and space
You and I are going to infiltrate
Tonight
You and I are going to infiltrate
I want
Before we start
I just want to take us to a place
I want you to
I just want you to have some
Inspiration
For the rest of our journey
And I want to warn you
I know that I've warned you in the past
But tonight I'm warning you
This material is
Radioactive
You may walk away
From this
Regretting
That you saw it
For those of you
Who are starting to get that little nausea
Buckle up because here it comes
I'm bringing you the sources
This is necromancy
101 tonight
And I'm bringing you the sources
You're going to love this
Hold your stomachs
Because we're going right
Into the heart
What do we have tonight
We have a Christian mystery
Before we take you
Into the Christian mystery
In a
First-hand account
There's drugs
There's drugs
And there's babies
Drugs and babies
And a lot of blood
A lot of blood
Wow

Are you ready?
Nice
I don't want to steal the authenticity
That we do not
Accept any sort
Of cash
Or any sort
Of gold or silver
Or currency
Or glitch
Of electric space
That's the task
Nobody gets in the door
Who sells stuff
Welcome
To Lady Babylon
Initiating
Chocalypse
As I'm doing some
Images today
You are progressing down this path
You have to understand
That the only way to do that
Is to hear these sources
That are going to somebody
Who's classically trained on you
To associate
Sex
And religion
Sex
And religion
And sex
And religion
Nobody gets in the door
Who sells stuff
Everybody thank you
To Chewie and all the work
That Chewie's done
Because that's the only way
That we fly
My goat
Fantastic
Cult examiner and serious
Thank you so much for that
Contribution
Functioning museum
You see the artists that are willing
To step up when you say look
The only rule is
You're not going to take
Any money for anything
Yeah
You got to take the money out of the equation
People, you got to take it out
Where do you think that corruption comes
From? We used to worship nemesis
And you know the rule
You know the rule
That stuff corrupts
Yeah
It does. You can't wash it off
You can't wash it off. Love it
The watchers love it too
Where are we going tonight? We're going to a village
Of creeps man. I'm telling you
Bring up my first
Yeah, this is the people
That we're going to
I'm going to show you some images and everything
Chewie's going to be flashing them up there
These things may assault you
Oh, are you ready for this?
You better be on your throne
Everybody out there?
Satanic initiation? Everybody's been through it
Sit in the throne
Be in the throne. Fantastic
We're going to go see the euhite
Today
The who and the what
These are the people that pray, don't you know
They are
A group of Christians
Who understand
And perform
The mystery. Are you ready?
And perform it tonight for us
Just for you and me. I knew you'd love it
I knew you'd love it. That's why
That's why I brought you
Love it. Let's go. Next one
Look at this. Okay, this is before
Hey, open your mouth
I'm going to spit in it
Are you ready?
That's what the text is saying
Hey, get your dirty minds out of the gutter
Chewie, blow that up
I want to be able to translate this for people
Oh, so this dude comes along
And what happens? He says
Um, I, I'm
I'm commanding you
What do you want me to do, bro?
Put this in your mouth. Take this plant
What?
Yeah, and then when I took his plant
And then he opened my mouth
And he spat in it
He spat in your mouth. Yeah, he spat
Right in my mouth
And I was like, dude, I don't know if I can go this far
Next thing you know, he's putting
This in my mouth
He's putting this
In crustacean
In my eyes
He is Christing you
Yes, he is
Christing you
What is all this for?
Let me just translate it directly
It's so that we could see
The multitude of demons
Fantastic
Fantastic
And what happened
At that point
Well, you see, it was
A crow
No, it was a raven
A raven
It was a raven, it just
Flew right at me
Went right into my mouth
Right into my mouth
Raven in my mouth
Who was this guy
That did this to you
Fantastic
And he actually Christed you
Yeah, he had all the drugs
Give me the next one
It was a great time, I wish you guys
Had all been there
Blow this up, blow this up
What's this saying? Look people
These are the scholars
The source that I just gave you
Was a man named
What was his name?
Mike
Mike
And P.S
Psellus
And what did he do?
What did he do? Oh my god
He left us this wonderful account
Of these prayers
What do you do if you're an eohites?
You pray
That is how you bring
That power
Do you understand? Do you understand?
If you're not praying, you're not bringing the power
Let's bring it
Chewie, give me that text
Oh god, we gotta spit
Look, these are the scholars
Now we're talking about Mike
And they're saying, look
There's types of drugs, right?
Look at that second line
People in the first word
Do you ever see Christ used?
Is this a drug? Well, here it is
Even the people making the notes
Were saying, look, these are
Types of drugs, you know
We Christ people
For the sake of therapy
For the sake of therapy
You've never cast out a demon before, have you?
Oh god
I get it
You know what I mean?
Kind of like that
And boom!
Next thing you know, somebody spit in your mouth
And put stuff in your eyes
I knew you'd love this party
Let's keep going
See what else these people do
It has not even started
The stuff that I'm about to tell you
Oh my god, it's gonna get us all kicked out of the galaxy
Watch this, okay
Bring that up, yeah
So some of these things, he says
We drink and we've got powders
And we've got Christ
And those Christs are medicines
That are being applied
Applied to the eyes
Ah, fantastic
Spit in my mouth
Yeah, it's the way the medicine works
If you have a problem
With your physician drinking your urine
In your mouth
It probably antiquities not the place for you
Now let's go to the next text
Boom
Oh look, another note
I just wanted you to see another note
Look at the very bottom line
And everybody
When I talk about
Christ as the
Pharmaceutical operation
People looking at me and they scratch their head
Okay
This is for that
Annoying, this is for that
Annoying person
You know who you are
You know who you are
Here it is
Check it out, you
Stop, you gotta stop me when I
You gotta stop me when I go there
I had flashes, visions of
Things that
Rime with Gamora
Let's go
Look what's going on here
Christ Pharmaceuticals
Yeah, yeah
Get Christ the baby
Next one
Boom
Look what we've got here
Now this is a giant text, I am not
Going to stand here and translate this
I'm gonna break it down
A little bit and I just want it to roll
I just want it to roll
I want you to sit there
I want you to sit there in your chairs
You sit there in your car
Maybe you propped up on your
Bed
Maybe you're sitting there in the jacuzzi
That's nice if you go to jacuzzi
Sit there and I just want you to soak up
The scene
Of what's going on
The scene because we're going to
Infiltrate the Christians
We're going to watch what they do
Are you ready
This
Is forbidden Christianity
Yeah, oh god
Look at them, they're getting here
Okay, go through here
Hurry before they get distracted
Before they get distracted
I'm going to begin this off for you
It was night time
About the time that the people
Light the torches, blow it up
And you know
It's about the time that we go out
And sing
The satiric passion
Is about that time
So what do they do
What do they do
You can tell me what they're doing
Oh
So they gather together
All the girls
Who have been trained
For these specific purposes
And they
Put them together
Inside
Of pre-selected chamber
Fantastic
Get them a
Room
Get them a room for the
Evening
What do these girls do there
The first thing is
They put out the lights
Go ahead, give me the next one
First thing is
They put out the lights
Right
It's dark
Why do they put out the lights
You might ask, well what does he say here
So
That they have
No light of
Witness
Of their dirty
Dirty acts
Remember
This is a pretty
Frustrated
Frustrated man
Writing
Some of the things that you see in it
You gotta remember
The author is everything
And this guy is a genius
Don't
Please, don't forget that
Take that home with you
But
He's Michael Salas
Fantastic
Let's look at the drugs he's going to talk about
They didn't think I would bring him this
But hey
We got a 93
Let's go to the next one
Fantastic
What happens, so it's at night
You get all these girls in this designated place
And you put out the lights
So that you don't have to see anything
And then what happens
Look at that third line down
Middle of the line
In our cell
In our cell
In our cell
In our cell
In our cell
In our cell
In our cell
In our cell
In our cell
We're making babies
What?
You're making babies?
Shh
We're making
Babies
And we're going to use those babies
We're doing it
Outside
The boundaries
Of law
This is not
Natural
You know what we use
We use
The black
Foam
We use the black foam
Use the black foam to inseminate
That seed
Is the unnatural seed
Let's see
Oh god is this
What are they doing this for
Can you believe this
What are they doing it for
Let's go to the next one
When you understand
The
The dirt that's in the language
You can't go back baby
You can't go back
So they do
They enter into
Our cell, GAIA
I need you to
Yeah
I need you to go back one
Just go back, drop back one
Now if you leave the storm troopers
Yes that's good
You know
In whatever way
They do this, ASEL GAIA
Now if you grab for yourself
A
British
Victorian
Gent
And ask to him
What is ASEL GAIA
You
Uptight scholar
Oxford and he'll say
Why it's wanton violence
And you'll say first of all
I do not know the word wanton
But it sounds dirty
And he'll tell you
In fact it is dirty
Violence
In ways that we do not
Speak unless we say wanton
And I am waxing
Wanton
Okay
That's what they're doing to the girls
Okay
Those dirty
Christians
Go to the next
That same source
How do they do it
As each person
Wants
Oh my god
And what happens
There's a sister
And a daughter
And a coming together
And why do we do it
I didn't hear any men
There's a patient of any men here
Uh huh
Now you know why they're trained
Because it takes a lot of work
To be able to do this
Have you ever tried inseminating a bull
Yeah
You got the wrong
Right
Cart
Horse, not quite
When you take
To that
Cow in estrus
When you take to her
That semen
That has been prepped in a solution
That won't kill the semen
The freezing won't kill the semen
And yes I'm AI certified
How'd you know
Um and
When you're going to inseminate
You have to
Have proper
Suspension
If you don't
Things are gonna go bad
And that goes
To the girls of antiquity
Who were able to figure out
The science of being able to
Transfer to a virgin
The unlawful seed
Everybody
Everybody the unlawful seed
Can I give a
Can I give a
Shout out to the
Virgin with her unlawful seed
This is fantastic
I love this
Now why does this all happen
Go to the next text
Why does this all happen
Because the demons
If you're not harnessing
The demonace
You're in the wrong place
What are you doing here
Seriously
Did you want to cure these people or not
You gotta have powers to cure
Right
Okay and how do you attract those powers
Oh god
Look
They do these things
Right and you're not supposed to care
If it's a mother who's inseminating
Her daughter
That's
The draw
Of the ancient orgy
Right what does he say
He says because
If you
Transgress those divine
Laws
If you transgress
The nature of the universe
What happens
It
Draws those demons
That's what they really want
They really want to be drawn
And
What's the thing that really
The text says what is the thing that really draws them
What kind of
You know
Getting together
That's what it says literally
What kind of getting together
That really drives the demons
Now come on if you're sitting there tonight
And you don't know the answer
This is a question you have not lived
You have not lived
Now every one of you out there
Knows it
Knows it
I know it's just you and me
But you know it
You know it
What is that drawn
Are you ready I'm going to let you feel this
I'm going to send this out
That really brings the demon
Ah
You know it brings the demon
Mixing
Homogenous blood
Wait
What
Mixing
Homogenous blood
Just for my audience
Are you referring to
Yes
Jesus
A brother and a sister
A father and a daughter
A mother
And her son
And Paul
The apostle gets up
And he says wait
Wait a minute
That's got to stop
And everybody's like what did that
Viper junkie say
Right on his horse
Man
Boom
Are you on the throne too
There's not an awful mystery going on
So what do they do Chewie
What do they do
Oh my god
What do they do
Bring up the next one
Next one
We got to the end there
Oh fantastic
Look at that top line
By the way
Homogneugamon
Doesn't it sound dirty
Ooh
It is, it's very dirty
Homogenous blood
Marriages
Now
The benefit
Going outside
Of natural law
Is that
You
Get to use the results
Of what you create
What's contrary to nature
Let's see what they create
Let's see what they create
Oh god so what do they do
They
When they finish
When these expert women finish
And things
Happened and we wait
Tick tock tick tock
Nine months later
Are you ready now you and I
We couldn't be at the insemination
Because don't be a dirty freak
Raw
You know what I mean
But
Now we can go to the nine month reaping
Are you ready you Saturnian freaks
Are you ready
You're gonna love this
Oh god what happens
What happens when they finish up in these rides
They disband they wait nine months
And they get back together
Right why because there's a
Time
For them to reap those
Ripping them away from their mother
Ripping them away from their mother
What do they do
What do they do
Oh god
First of all look at the
Fourth line in this
And I just want you to see the expression
Ta
X
You see that
These
Feetuses
Are
Are we a Christian right
Yes
These fetuses
Are made
From that sperm
That is outside
Of
The natural
Divine
Law
You mean these
Early Christians are being witches
Oh god
Can you do that
I promised you I would bring you
I promised I would bring you
Okay
But here it comes are you ready
Are you ready that was the
You know we're getting into the main course
Are you ready
Oh
Children
Here we go
Let's go bring it up next one
What happens here and there's we've only got
A few more of these so
Let's find the glory here
What happens
When they finish it they come back
And then next
Next shoey
And what happens and then
Oh god
And then
After
They've taken away the child and ripped it away
And they call this thing the deustena
This is the accursed
Do you understand
I forgot to tell you
I forgot can you take it down from
This is the
Accursed seed
Yeah this is the accursed
Seed that we're talking about
You have to remember
That the satan
Satan
Himself he was
Son of God
Yeah
You
You might not have known that
But
Realized that we're in the process
Of burning off mortality
Yeah
Fantastic
Don't you like what the virgin produces
And why he is the Christ
You mean those Christians
Were actually doing the real
Right
Yes
How where do you think history is
Oh my god
Seriously
Oh
Let's keep delving
Get back to the source
We're going to have to play the goat song again
Let's see what does he do
Let's just look at the third line down
They take these
And what do they do
They
They make incisions in them
They make incisions
They cut things
And from these cuttings
They collect the blood
They collect the blood
And
What do they do with the blood
What do they do with the blood
Well, they use the blood
In a
Medicine
That makes me
Ten years younger
What
Yeah, no, I'm not kidding
They have
I can tell you as somebody
Who has worked in a laboratory
Right
I've done several different types
Endocrine
Andrology
Neuro
Doing brain sections
Ooh, love that
Yeah, and I can tell you
For a fact
As a scientist
What they're doing
Is remarkable
They're talking
About transfusion
Transfusion
Do you know
What you can do with a fetus
Just
Hang on
You can grow
The fetus, show some of the pictures
Please
You can grow a fetus
Inside
Your body
And you can feed
Your body
A regimen
Of drugs
That by the time those nine months
Are over
Your son a god
Ready for christing
And we're gonna take his blood
Why?
Because Christ's blood
Is life
You say what
Yeah
How old do you think that guy is
You ever seen any growths on him
Interesting
Yeah
Wow
You mean there's
Applications to this? Yeah
Yeah
We have lost
A thousand years
Of scientific development
We've lost it
The
Favor
That Christianity did
Western civilization
Was
To mute
And to retard
Our
Scientific progress
I will remind you
As the devil
Is always harping
I'll remind you
It's not
It's about power
And the enemy
Of democracy
Will always
Masquerade as its
Greatest champion
They'll rewrite history
Right in front of your eyes
Aren't you glad to be alive this year
Aren't you glad
It's lovely
Sorry
I'm getting so excited
Let's do the next text. These people
These are all professionals, man. These people
Need
Time and space to get things worked out
Right? So look, they collect them
And they put the
Blood into the vials
Next one, please
And
I just want you to see
That one of the things that they're cutting
They call the sarchia
Of these children
That are
Defection
And forcefully delivered
And then subjected to the burning
Subjected to the burning
And when the mothers see it
They're always like, no!
Right?
They're like, no!
What are you doing?
You know? And that's why
We have the Ellicinian
Mysteries
You didn't realize that?
Demyphon
They're doing the same thing
The Christians
Oh
Their entire history
To the Greek Mysteries
There wouldn't be anywhere
Mustadion is a Greek word
Right?
There's no Hebrew around at the time, people
Put your storybook down
Charlton Heston's dead
Fantastic
Fantastic
Let's go to the next
What is this little piece of flash?
Go back
People, I was showing them baby flash
What do they cut of the children?
What do they cut?
They cut the sarchion
Well, it's a diminutive of sarx
Why didn't you just say sarx?
Which would mean flash?
Yeah, why didn't you just say that?
I want you to look at Roman numeral number two
This is bits of flash
Bitty bits
Okay, fine, look at number two
They're purple
Numfe
Uh-oh
I hear nymph
Everybody loves nymphs, don't they?
If they don't, they need more goat time
Whoever does not love nymphs
Needs goat time
Give me the next one
What is our nymph here? Blow it up, Chewy
Check this out, people
I want you to see it's a young wife, bride
Marriageable maiden
Young girl
Yeah, take it down
Give me the next one
What else is a nymph?
Oh, you see, a nymph is a huge
concept in Antimune
This can be an actual force of nature
that you have to deal with
You ever deal with a nymph?
You know what they always do? Nymphs
Right, first of all, always beautiful
Right, get a shout out to all the nymphs out there
Um, gorgeous
Especially those tree nymphs, man
You gotta give it to them
You know, but what do they do?
They do things like
drown you in a sexual frenzy
Right
Oh, seriously?
Where do you think Heracles, boy, went?
Right?
Where do you think
he ended up?
Yeah, he ended up in the arms of a nymph
Isn't that how it is, Addis?
Put your privates away, Addis
And then they
cut them off
Isn't that funny?
Oh, nymphs
Nymphs, you better have a crowd of people
with you if you're ever around
the nymphs
Yes, read more
Goat time, more goat time
Hit it
Hit the goats again
Oh, bring it, I can feel it
Can we get my goat?
Can we get my goat?
Where's my goat?
Can we get my goat?
Can we get my goat?
Can we get my goat?
Nice
It's my goat
It's my goat
I want to bring
to you
the confusion
I want to bring to you
the confusion
The nymphs
Okay, here it comes, are you ready?
Nice
The goat
The goat
I don't want to steal the authenticity
That we do not accept
any sort of cash
reversible
or any sort of gold
silver, black
currency
glitch of electric
space inside
Fantastic, nobody gets in the door
to sell stuff
Yeah, it's never less
Welcome to
Lady Babylon
Initiating
Chocolates
As I'm doing some
images today
You are progressing down this path
You have to understand
the best, the only way to do that
is to hear these sources
that are going to somebody who's
classically trained on you
to associate
sex and
religion
sex and
religion
sex and
religion
Nobody gets in the door to sell stuff
Everybody thank you
to Chewie and to all the work
that Chewie's done
because that's the only way that we fly
My goat
Okay, Chewie hit it
We got one more star system to go to
What is going on?
Look what else a nymph can be
For those of you
who have the stomach
The rosebud
Right?
Particularly the opening rosebud
What a beautiful image
The nymph
That spirit of that
spring
You know what I'm talking about
That nymph
She's that opening rosebud
If you take those images
as you sit on the throne
You'll be able to access that grotto
Right?
That's pan scrotto
What is pan?
Who is pan?
He's the nymph chaser
Nymph chaser
Seriously?
Here, here to the
nymph chaser
Let's go
These people have things to do
What was the other one?
Bring up the definition
I think we dropped out something very dirty
Retch screaming
I can hear him screaming
Look at number nine
What is that?
This is from people
Okay, for everybody who wants to
censor the knowledge
of the world
I will not let you do that
for the Greek
This word
means
Roman numeral number nine
Cleteris
And the sources are Rufus
And Galen
Look at Galen
Oh yeah, Galen's there
Right? Okay, so scientifically
people, they're cutting
They're cutting these
children
They're cutting these children
And taking the
blood
You get a whole harvest
of these Christian babies
Right? That you take the
blood from
What do you do with the kids?
You smoke them
You smoke, you do what?
You smoke them
Welcome to
Elucis
People try to sell you stuff online
Remember? People try to sell you stuff
online. Here, here's my course
and the mysteries and there is nothing
in there
Why?
Because they were just
trying to sell you something
Satanic congregation
didn't buy it, did we?
No, we didn't
Because we don't get taken
advantage of
We don't! This is Nemesis
Baby
Let's go, Project Nemesis, let's go
Look at this! Okay, here, what's happening?
Oh my god, they mix
the baby blood
It's in the vials
And by the way, the word for the vial
and what is that?
It's a word that an angel
uses. It's an instrument
It's like a little
holder of drugs. They call it
the container of the sharp
plague
Oh god, you pour
this stuff out and you know what happens
when they bring this stuff? You
can see the entire
troop of demons
Oh god
You interrupt, has something to do
with your brain, interrupt your brain
All of a sudden you're seeing quantum stuff
Oh my god, next thing you know
you're wandering around
tempted by the devil
longest
longest on record
Oh, love it, let's go
Where is Jesus
tonight by the way?
Are we finding the Christ?
Let's find him
What do they make with it?
Look at the third line down
The third line
Delugma sundit easin
Wait, they what?
They synthesize
literally or compound
The delugma
The what?
The delugma
It's the synthetic delugma
Wait a minute
Isn't this the
thing that Chewie
Wait, we've seen this before
What is this
abomination
that we're talking about
Give me the next one
Look people
Here's the quote
Where is it?
Right up you
Here we go
All right, Kai Hegune
There was this woman right and she's
closing the stuff and whoop whoop whoop
What happens?
Second line near the end line
She's got a golden
cup in her hand
And what is she doing?
What's in that golden cup?
The same thing you and I just saw
Delugma
It is her
abomination
Ladies, did you know that you could
produce an abomination?
Yes, you can
You can, it's a part
of your witchy creative activity
But it's this witchy creative activity
This witchy genius
That has given us the Christ
So we owe them, don't we
Who are you talking we?
We owe them, don't we?
We've got to give them the truth
You people develop this
And now they've got to know it
Christ is from this
Now we know
Ever since Jesus
got brought up on charges
You know
Declared guilty
It's okay, talking about Jesus's
naked boy that he was arrested
with in a public park at 4 a.m.
That's all okay
And by the way
I will be talking
In a couple of interviews
coming up
Trying to keep these people
From putting them behind
Some kind of paywall
Because the devil was like
And I was like, what?
Who said that? Which one of these
demons
Excuse me
There he is
One of them
Gave you a bad story
Because I don't do any hookery
I don't
Refuse it
No hookery
That's what happens
When you give in
And you compromise
You know what side can be turned over
You know what's going to be
Exposed, don't you?
Greed, man
Greed is a terrible thing
No hookery, please
For anyone
Yeah
Let's go back to
The Lady Babylon
There we go
She's got that golden cop
With that real genuine formula
With that
Pollution
That can
Reverse aging
You know
That can prevent growths
You know
Stabilism
Isn't that weird? You're programming
People biologically
It's this type of medicine
We lost it
We lost it
Yes
It could be taken back
It could
But then where are we going to find all the babies?
Right? Oh god
Don't you love this? You evangelicals out there
If you don't hear this
And know that this is the end
You know, right now
You should go up to your
If you're an evangelical
Walk up to your rooftop
Yeah
Go out to your roof
Stand there and look up
Because Jesus
Is on his way
He is on his way
And he's going to be bringing with him
A naked kid
Hit us with the last
Let's go
Sorry, a little bit of Latin
So we don't lose our culture
What is he saying?
Oh my god
It scares me to have to bring this to you
To show you
Gods that are made captive
The very elements themselves
Serving
Nature
Bound
To serve a girl
Stars of the pole
The course of the sun
The constellations of the sky
All of them led
By the will of a woman
A woman who
Suspends the lightning
The things that Medea
Orders
When she
Commands
That the
Ethereal flame
Return
Oh my god
Her voice penetrates the air
Excellent, love it
Who is that? Some cultist, right?
Connected with all? Yes, of course
What do you think, man? They're singing these hymns
Anywhere else?
You people are remarkable
You always follow
Go to the last text
I'm going to make some comments
About you people too
I just want you to see
Don't be
Don't be surprised
Right?
If these
Woman-shaped
Demons
Come to you
Don't be surprised
Okay, why?
Why?
They're going to come in forms
These demons, I'm telling you
They're going to come in forms
Listen, this is between you and me
And satanic initiation
On our date
As we're watching this
And as we're seeing it
Remember, there's an exchange going on
Right? There's an exchange
And I want you to keep an eye
On the blood here
And if we see a demon
Who is
A woman
And that woman is forcing
You as a woman
To do things that
That should be
Hidden in darkness
Realize
That we've made it
We've made it to that medicine
And maybe
We can find a cure
Maybe we can find a cure
Thank you very much
For coming tonight
I want to tell everybody
That I will list any sort of interviews
That I'm giving right now
I'll
I'll put them up here too
And I'll list them for you
I'd love to tell you, but I haven't seen any links yet
That I can give you
That you don't have to pay for
Shame on the world
Right? Shame on the world
As Nemesis
The Furies
Say
Your greed
Stains your souls
With the stench of ruin
Yeah
Fair enough, blood
Yeah
I just want to tell you
Thank you so much
For spending your time here with me
And I want you to know
That every minute that I
Engage with these texts
Every time
Every time I'm telling you
I can feel you
And I can feel that draw
I appreciate
I appreciate your energy
Yeah
Yeah
I appreciate your energy
And when I'm prepping this
I'm doing it knowing that I don't want
You to have anything
But what is the reality
We want the pure spring
We are raising the museum
We are raising it
And in our meetings you can see
You can see the art
Coming to life
And you can see people stepping up
And this is the time
We need to bring back the museum
And
Our way to do it is through this
Fun, fun, fun stuff
Thank you for coming tonight
Thank you Jesus for being arrested
In a public park
At 4am with a naked boy
Because this gives me such
Comfort
It gives me such comfort
If you're up on the roof
And you're waiting for Jesus
Keep looking
Hail Satan
In the air tonight
It's alright
Babylon, lovely lady
