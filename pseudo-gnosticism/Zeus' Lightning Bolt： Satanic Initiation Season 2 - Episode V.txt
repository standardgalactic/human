Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met
I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace
Where is that whore called Destiny
I think she ran on without me
Thank you for coming back to Lady Babylon
Tonight we have a great, great topic to cover
We're going to be looking at Maya, the midwife
And our goal is to bring her into the present
That's right, to reach from the past, from the future
And bring the Mogostokia to life
Beautiful stuff
I've got a video for you tonight about our topic
It's just laced with the most beautiful subliminal messaging
My compliments tonight to Chewie
What I'd like to do is I'd like to just jump into a ship here
And let's just get things going
There's no reason to mess around tonight
Let's go right back, I want to take you right back to a guy named Nonus
And I want to pull his ghost out of grave
And just so you can put him somewhere in history
We're talking about the transition between Roman rule and Christian rule
And there is a big difference
We are living now, we land our ship and we get out of it
And we realize, oh, we are living now at that crossover
When people are afraid to publish
Because the Christian authorities will not only burn their work
But will burn them
So we are dealing with a phenomenon called crypto pagans
And that's what I want to do, is I want to take you tonight to see a crypto pagan
His name is Nonus
And he is able to publish the longest epic in Greek
The longest, the longest by far
And that epic is about Dionysus
An epic about Dionysus
And to start that epic off
We have to start at the heart of the cult of Dionysus
That heart, that inner sanctuary
Is the mogostokia
That is, what is that?
That is the pain of birth
That is the pain that one feels while giving birth
There's a special word for it, the birth pang is usually how it's translated
It's never pleasant, never pleasant
Always painful, it's a portal, a doorway
And this Maya watches over that doorway
She brings the living from that dark death
So, just to explain to all the Christians
That we have invited to come in and please continue inviting
Particularly evangelicals
Because there is a need right now for evangelicals to see the work that we are doing
And for those of you who have come tonight
I want to say we're tracking Jesus
We're following Jesus
Last week we looked at him in the apocalypse
And we found out, we found out that his face glowed as Helios
We saw that gown he was wearing
We saw the wig, the white wig
And we understood he is the Christos
Yes, now we're going to look at the reason
We're tracking that naked boy that was with Jesus when he was arrested
We want to ultimately solve that issue historically
And put it to bed so that people 2,000 years ago
Excuse me, 2,000 years from now
Can be able to say, hey look at these people
We're looking at the reality, right? That's all we ask
Just look at the reason
So, tonight we're going to track him through Maya
And in order to do that, we're going to track this naked boy through Maya
Yes, you're going to see him there
You're going to see the cult
And for those of you who have ears to hear
You will see the portrait of the Christ that you have never seen before
This is the heart of the lightning
This is that Bacchic lightning
Can you hear the video please?
It seems
All we have here stays behind
We go with what we had when we came
We will leave no track, no trace
No name upon the walk of fame
Way beyond the sky upon another world's shore
Lost inside a dream within a dream
We try to find the reason why we're living what for
Why, which when, where, who, what for
Why, which when, where, who, what for
All we have here stays behind
We go with what we had when we came
We will leave no track, no trace
No name upon the walk of fame
Please go with me now to know us
And let's start with the Greek text
And I just want to give you just a glimpse
If we can just get just a glimpse
I had a student that I'm working with this week
Asked me if we could start reading
And I said yes and he said can we do
Known us, can we read known us
And I laughed because known us is using
Esoteric terminology, he's using cult terminology
He's using a lot of drugs
There are drug references
I mean you can't throw rock in this book
Without hitting the drug reference somewhere
And good stuff too, the arrows
We've got arrow poisons, we've got women
We've got women who are mean ads
Wearing armor, carrying weapons, shooting bows
Smashing heads, armored women
This is not the antiquity of Cambridge
This is not the falsehood, the fairy tale
This has been fed, this is a place where
Great people like Corinna
I forgot to tell you guys about Corinna
Corinna was one who got into the lyric poetry competition
With a very famous person
This very famous person, Pender
Was beaten squarely by her in the competition
And she came up to him afterwards
And let him know, yeah you've been bested
Right, she was doing a little bit of
You know, stepping out, showing him
Because his mouth was big
And all he could say to her was that
You're ugly, yeah, quite a moment in history
Athenian women, women in antiquity
Women all over did not stay in their homes
In silence, this was not the 50s, Mary Beard
This is gorgeous stuff
Tonight we're going to look at the text now
This is known as, let's read it together, shall we?
Epithel, look at that, we start out
Right away as an implication
It's an implication to the muse
And you say, oh they're doing this in antiquity
They're doing it all the time, right?
They invented it back with Homer
Yeah, right, realize where you are
You are in a place where you are worshiping the muse
Yes, you are in a place where you are worshiping the muse
Silence, silence, holy silence
Yes, somebody was writing to me about dragon tongue
Tracking down dragon tongue
The secret about dragon tongue is that it is spoken
It is spoken in silence
Yes, figure that one out
Perhaps whoever cracks that will be able to track down
The naked boy that Jesus was arrested with
Then we'll all have a Merry Christmas
Epithel, crony da, o diaktoron aithopos auges
That's our first, Dactylic line
That's a Dactylic hexameter
Yeah, and so we're harkening back
You notice that when we're reading the hymns
When we're reading the hymns
We are in a specific ritual meter
Yes, the Romans came up against this Dactylic hexameter
And their response was Saturnian verse
Yeah, the very golden age
These meters are coming alive
And bringing this incredible, incredible wisdom to humanity
Through the muse, you only get there through the muse
What is he saying here?
Crony da, o diaktoron
What is a diaktoron?
He's saying, tell me, muse
He's saying, speak to me of what?
Speak to me of the messenger of the son of Cronus
The messenger of the son of Cronus
Who is he?
He's the diaktoron
The conveyor of the aithopos auges
Auge is that sunlight
It's that sunlight that hits the face
That you can feel that communion with that entity
It's sunlight
Yes, it is a burning
It is a burning
Yeah, aitho
To spark to life, to burn
Yes, good
So we have the descendants of the son in front of us
We have those with that bright, heliac face
The face of Helios
Yeah, remember, there's only a couple of people that are put in those
We use those terms with an antiquity
One of them is Jesus
One of them is the family of the ETs
The members of the family of the ETs
They emanate this from their ops
Here, notice follows that
And we get aithopos
That burning that comes from the ops
You're going to notice
Notice how many of these facial expressions we have
Yes, tell me, Muse, of the mogostokon
Asthma
The asthma, that brief inhalation
That brief exchange with the atmosphere around you
That causes this particular to a woman's birthing process
A woman's birthing process
Okay, fantastic, yes
And what is the source of this?
This asthma
It is brought to you by the nymphedios
Spintheri
Spintheri is a spark
Boom, and what is a nymphic spark?
What is the spark of the nymphic experience?
Yeah, okay, we're getting again
We just got out of the ship
Give yourself a minute to accumulate, you know
Commodate to the changes and the pressure
Yes, good, good, good, good, good
And what is this breath?
It's the breath of the katalnu
That's a thunderbolt
That's that booming thing that causes you to fear
That causes you to crouch when you hear it
Whether you're a dog or a person or a snake
Yes, it doesn't matter
It has that instinctive fear of sudden fear
Sonic boom, they love that
On the third line
What else are we calling upon?
We're calling on that thalamapolon
What is that?
That's the one who directs within the inner chamber
Specifically the inner chamber of women
Do we have this one?
I want people to see this one because there is
There we go chamber
Thank you
Yes, take a look at this in the definitions here
Watch the word enjoy the Greek and absorb the power here
Just an inner room or chamber
Generally the women's apartment
Inner part of the house
Yes, wow, wow, bedroom, right
It's the place where the valuables are kept
Roman numeral number four on the bottom
Used of certain mystic shrines and chapels
Sacred to opus, the innermost chamber
That's where we are, we're in that innermost chamber
And we have the pole there
What is the pole doing?
The pole is a zone
Thank you, it is a zone
The axis, right?
That's the one ordering and determining the track
That will all go down
Translated, these are servants of the queen
Who serve within her chamber, her inner chamber
Medea had 12 of these
They were her drug procurers and pharmacologists
Yes, Scythians
Very active women with skill in the bow in the arrow
And the use of toxins
Particularly the toxins like the oysters
That are used in the child birthing process
We've seen Christ is linguistically connected
With the insanity produced by the sting of the oysters
That's how we all get in Ostromania
And how we're symbols, right?
We've all seen that
Here it is again
Look at the very word on line 3 for that lightning
Stereo-pain
Stereo-pain
Ster-ops
Look at that, you've got an ops there
And you've got the S-T-R root
Right?
That lightning is just a linguistic cousin
Of the oysters
The lightning, bathed in oysters
Comes the child into the world
This is gorgeous
Now, remember, we're surrounded by midwives
Let's see, let's see a couple of them
Line 3 at the end
Ape de fotlen
Bahu
Disotocoyo
Tell me about the nurturing
The naturification
The becoming the nature
The incarnation
The incarnation
Tell me about this
Did you know they had incarnation before?
Oh yeah, no, when Jesus is casting out demons
He's doing it based upon a long tradition
You guys know that
I don't need to tell you that
Let's make sure we're making good time here
I don't want to waste the folks' time
Look at, so tell me about that
Twice-born Bacchus
Wait, you got to be born again?
Yes, you got being born again
It's old, right?
Very old concept
It's an old mystery concept
Fantastic, long time
Long time before the first century
When Jesus is around
Right?
So this is already set up in culture
And what happens?
Zeus raises this breakfast, this kid
Out of the burning flame
Right?
He takes this lump of moisture
That is within simile
Because that's the name of the queen
Whose bedchamber we happen to be in
Yeah, we're golly
Alright, somebody asked me this week about
Is there a necessity to cut off the testicles?
If we're going to serve in the queen's chamber
We have to cut off our testicles
Yeah, think about that there for a minute
Just think of it
Take yourself back to Sidon
Take yourself back to that temple
That Lucian writes about
That the Sedonians, where they worship a start
Think about her
The Greeks said that's our hero, by the way
Yeah, yeah
But think about her and the power
Her worshipers
The worshipers of the great mother
Castrate themselves
Yes, if your eye offends
Cast it out, yes
Beautiful, the music was great, by the way
And what happens?
So Zeus takes him and sows him up, right?
Because she is birthing via
Simile is birthing via the lightning
Via the lightning
And the first time we see in line 5
Amai eutoyo decuses
When Zeus intervenes
And he removes the moisture
From Simile
And exposes her to that lightning
To that fire, that great sunfire
She is consumed
She is consumed and
What this process lacks
Is the Maya
There is no Maya
And Nona says that, right?
This artificial practice
That maintains the power of the Jehovah
I don't care if you say Jehovah
Or if you say Jehovah
I don't care, and then everybody says
Shh, don't say it
It's the same God the Father
And he keeps screwing up
He keeps screwing up
He's the oldest liar
Yes, check the Bible, people
My evangelicals who have shown up today graciously
Ask yourself why it is that God is the first liar
Yeah, we're talking here
About the family
Of the flip side, of the flip pole
We're talking about the morning stars
Okay, keep breathing
We'll go in there, we'll get there
So, line five
That's where we are without the Maya
By the way, ladies who are doulas out there
And I know that you've identified yourselves before
Something that I thought was very interesting
That you may have a better understanding of
Is that Maya, the name of the goddess
It's a name, Maya
And her name means her craft
That's how we say midwife is Maya
Maya
What I thought was interesting was
She is the only Olympian
She's the only God within the pantheon
Who prefers and chooses
To live on earth in a cave
She's the only God
She's the only God that prefers to live
In a mortal environment within the cave
And her son preserves that
His messangering is all under her leadership
Under her college
So when you see the caduceus
With the two serpents and the rod
You know this is part of the college
This is part of the college of the midwives
Something very special
I don't know what it means
Maybe somebody can tell me
I don't know what it means
That she is the one who prefers to live
In the element, if you will
She could be ethereal
She chooses to be aerial
Yeah, nice, nice, love it
Anyway, let's keep reading
Zeus makes himself the pater
Caipotnia meter
He makes himself, interestingly enough
The father and the queen mother
The queen mother
Interesting, okay
Let's keep reading
Let's keep reading
I've got a little bit more
Yeah, why?
He knows of another birth
Everybody's saying, I forgot to tell you
The gossip is coming through the sibles
Zeus Jehovah Jove
The father god is destined to be overthrown
So this is what's perpetuating
All of this action
Again, evangelicals
I'm talking to the people who are here
Who hear the analog
They hear the analog
They know what's being said
They can decode
From his temple
He becomes pregnant from his temple
Is this thing called a temple?
Yes, it's the temple of your head
Yes, and from the temple of his head
He pours out
Now this is funny
The translation that the Harvard people use
Is old
And every time somebody can't
The translator can't figure out
What NONUS is doing
Because NONUS is using
I'm filtering this out for you
But NONUS is using words that only appear
Those Hapox Legoma
They only appear once
And we only have this citation of it
And there are words that he is obviously creating
A lot of them
Are words that he is obviously creating
But of the ones that aren't
That aren't his working
That they just happen to be
Hapox Legoma
Those have a share in an antiquity
That we can't
I mean, those are the real finds
Linguistically, those are the jewels
That are in it
And every once in a while
You come across one of those
That gives you an insight into the cult
The cult operation
And then you can see that mystery
Just a little bit more clearly
And we have some of that here
Because Zeus
He sends out
He emits Athena
He emits Athena
Emits Athena
And it's not just a sin
As you and I would think of to sin
It means to send as in
To push water or a fluid
To push water
To squirt
So in the mind of the ancient Greek
Zeus is conveying
And why is it, why do we know
This is a sexual reference
Because she is considered the asporon
She is considered the seedless
Yeah, she is considered the seedless
She springs solely
From that mind
And she is the astraptusan
The one who brings the lightning
The astrape
You'll notice it's just strape, right?
The asterion
Is just the str root
In use
So here once again
Connected with the very power of God
You all know that lightning is connected with God
Whether you're reading the Old Testament
Or whether you're reading some pagan works, right?
You know that that God the Father
Is a God of lightning
You didn't know what the lightning was before now
The lightning is that which bathes
The morostokia
Bathes that process
Of the ultimate pain of birth
Of bringing that entity into life
Right, bringing life from death
So Maya, the midwife
Becomes the one linchpin of the entire mystery
It's the linchpin that the Christians removed
Right, we know it's unfortunate
We know what happened was unfortunate
That Jesus got caught
In a public park with a naked boy
And arrested and condemned
And yelled at by a mob
And forced to go to death
In the place of a dude who they knew
Had killed someone
Yeah, so we're trying to find
It's unfortunate, that's how the circumstances ended up
And he ends up dying on the cross
Before his time, right?
But he is that one
To whom is brought the drugs
And the financing
That he can carry the title of the yeson
Yes, that he can be the Christos
Why? Because the asterion
Has brought us to him
Because we followed the star
Right, so I want you to see the context
And I want you to remember
We need to see a dance
Because we are at a place
Where we have to constantly remind ourselves
And this is good for the evangelicals as well
And please, invite your evangelical friends
Please
We are at a place where we have to stop
And say, wait a minute
Let's just get a historical perspective here
Who is the oldest goddess?
Who is the oldest divinity?
Is it Jehovah? Who is it?
So, from this lightning
Now, you want those symbols
You want the real ones
You want the old ones, right?
That's what we're all looking for
And that's why we're pounding down
The Aryan connection
And the archers
The archers who are on the Scythian steeps
Yeah, what are we doing there?
We're living in a world with arrows
And we're living in a world with poisons
And we're transferring culture
Through these migrations that we're having
And all of it is ending up in this old, old, old poetry
And somehow we're getting these lines
We're getting these lines about these individuals
Yeah, yeah
So where does that bring us?
Where does that bring us?
Yeah
We come to the source
We have to have the lightning
We have to know what they're doing with the lightning
We have to have the wa-wa-wanasa
We have to have that power
We have to find her
And we have to bring her forward
And in order to do so, we have to go into the language
And we have to pull out very basic elements
The scientific stuff that's there
You guys have been following this
And many of you have been tracking on the Discord
And you're working with other sources
And seeing how the mystery is pursued across time
And I'm hoping that with enough work
We can elucidate a broader history
Of the working of the mystery
Instead of its hijacking by the dude Moses
And its hijacking by the dude Jesus
We can go back and we can see it in its original form
And find that Maya
What is the lightning that she bays the infant in?
What is that Ba'akik power?
Why are we here for the goddess?
It's because of that power
There was a river
I want to finish tonight
I encourage you to look at the river Arathusa
Because she was a witness
She didn't want to succumb to domination
So she became a witness
She flowed through the underworld
And saw the Korah
The great Korah
She saw her the Korwa Nasa
She saw her
And witnessed her place as a queen
She was the one who said
Demeter, you've got to let these humans live
You've got to let these humans live
For one reason
Your daughter is a queen
And she is acting as a queen
You can't stop that
And somehow, somehow that women's cult
Took that gem, that beauty of life
Of real life
And wove it into the history
Wove it in
And made the world that you now look at
And say your Hail Marys
And receive your Atonement
And raise your hands and praise and worship
And bring the offerings of your praise to your God
When you do that thing, when you do those things
Now you're doing them within a container
That was made by a guy who was arrested
In the public part with a naked boy
We need to bring this to the...
For the people who are sitting there
Who are actively pursuing this Satanic contract
Satanic pact
You have a responsibility to bring this reality to the world
You have a responsibility to free the people
Who are in the middle of it
You cannot discriminate against people
Whatever cult that they're in
Or whether they're on Fox News
From the tops of the mountains to the very bottom
You have to help these people to see the reality
It's our obligation, if we're going to honor the muse
It's our obligation to help them
And I just want to say
For those evangelicals who were out there
He was arrested in the public park
Like 4 a.m. with a naked kid
The institutions are built upon a dude
Who was disliked for what he had done
In the presence of that child one late night
We have an obligation
We must stand up
Thank you for coming tonight
I'm delighted with tomorrow's class
With Saturday's class
You guys are
Wow, you're giving everybody a run for their money
Already, you guys are busting it
And this is crack
You guys are going to be some crack
And I'll take you as far as you can go
I'll show you that you have something inside of you
That's bigger than you thought
That you can bring to the table
Yeah, it's going to be hard
And there's going to be a lot of sweat
And there's going to be a lot of agony
But you people are marvelous
And I know that we're going to break through
Yeah, nice, nice, I love it
You guys have a good evening
Hail Satan
Show me the girl I never met
I wanted so bad
Where is that golden palace
Where is that horse called destiny
I think she ran on without me
