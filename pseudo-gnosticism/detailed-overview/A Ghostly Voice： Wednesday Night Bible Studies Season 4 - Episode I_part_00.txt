Drinking whiskey, when that whisky's burnin'
Do my veins, Indian goes crazy
And the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've gotcha sellin' and you got your
Drinking whiskey, oh yeah
Drinking whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome to tonight's Wednesday Night Bible Study
at Lady Babylon Season 4
It's nice to see everyone
What we're gonna do tonight is take you into the deep
Get ready for this, okay? Get comfortable
Get your seat set up
You're sittin' there on that throne of Satan
Right in that spot
You are the morning star
Yeah, you are the morning star
You are in that throne
You are euthronic
That's an orphic word
For those of us who are learning the orphic speech
Fish, hurry up and figure out Dragontown
Tonight on Lady Babylon
We'll be looking at the Alpha and the Omega
And we'll have us just a short clip
That will satisfy the appetites of all you necromancers
I've been very much looking forward to this
What we're gonna do right off the bat
Before we jump up the Alpha and the Omega
Is we're going to invite a guest in
This is Chuck Baudelaire
Chuck, say hello to everybody
We're going to give you just a vision's moment
Of the great poetry of the Revenant
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Music
Thank you Chuck, that was very nice
That was very nice
Digest that
Take that symbol
Remember we're looking at the Saturnian verse
And Chuck is a master of the Saturnian verse
Yes, and so are his translators
Yeah, at least one on Flecker
Flecker, we gotta hunt down that guy
Okay, tonight I want to jump right into the Bible
Because here we are, this is our opportunity
And you guys know, this is all going according to a schedule
And our apocalypse will proceed accordingly
Tonight we're gonna look at Jesus Christ
We're gonna look at Jesus Christ
Let's look at him, I need the first reference, Chewie
Throw it up there, hit it
Excellent
I am the one who is, and who was, and who will be
I am the Ponto Crattor
Take it down, and you say, okay I got just about all of that
I got all of that up to that Ponto Crattor thing
And the evangelicals run around and they're like
Alpha to Omega, hoo hoo ha ha
Guessy guess, and tickle me fancy
Nothing comes out of it, but fairy tale
That you and I are dancing to
Like a bunch of zombies
I love it
Nobody looks at the end of that
Nobody looks at the end of that
Bring that up again Chewie
What is this word here? Ponto Crattor
Who is that?
Jesus Christ, give me the next slide
Look at this, look at this
Here's our word on the right
Look at it on the right here, we have Ponto Crattor
And this is the peculiar feminine
Of that form, Ponto Crattor
And why is it peculiar? Because it predates
It predates the stuff that you're using
Oh, so it's a feminine
Yeah, just like don't worry
It's Orphic Greek
And it is just like the Soter
And the Sotera
And it turns out just like Jesus Christ
Was not the first savior
Yeah, he was also not the first Ponto Crattor
Both of those forms are used earlier
Of a woman, both of them
It's not that the form is feminine
It's that it predates the masculine
Huh, well that's interesting
You can't screw around with Chronos, man
You just can't do it, this stuff is too hot
Okay, it's hot, you feel it?
Sizzling, it's sizzling
Let's get into Jesus Christ and the Alpha and the Omega
That formula by the way
That he put up there, the one that is
And the one that will be
Yeah, the one that was
Yes, repeated over and over and over again
That, my friends, is sibling oracle
That's what you're smelling
When you
You're like, oh, you smell the dank
Tonight we're getting the dank
Right, this is the dank
Are you on the throne?
Are you out there?
I know you are
Yeah, let's go to the next one
Pull it up, fantastic
Who is this one?
Who is this one?
I just want you to look
Just really quick here
I'm gonna have to put my glasses on
This is ridiculous
Here, I'm gonna pull up my own copy
People, I'm sorry
I'm sorry about that
Oh, there we go
