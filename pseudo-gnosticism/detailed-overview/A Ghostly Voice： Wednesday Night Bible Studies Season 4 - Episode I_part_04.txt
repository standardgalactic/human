This is to
Fusus
To nature
This is to Urania
This is to her
And who is she
A thousand years before Jesus
She is eternal life
Yeah
That's why he
Jesus is wearing her
Aphrodite
Girdle
Her accoutrement
Yeah
Did you know Jesus cross dressed
Only in the apocalypse
Right
There ought to be a club
In LA called the apocalypse
And in order to get in
You have to dress up as Jesus
Cross dressing
Yeah
I would go
To that club
And I would drink
Whatever it was
That they were serving
In order to get in touch
With that power
Yeah
That's awesome
They used to say
The Balkans always lead to Aphrodite
They always lead to Aphrodite
Ace Aphrodite
You can hear the club music
You can hear it
Right
Oh my god
It's gorgeous
Let's keep going with the Greek
Before I dance away
Let's keep
Let's go to the next one
We're running out
We're running low on time
I want you to
Please blow it up
I want you to see
This little bit about Cersei
Look at you starting
This is from the Orphic Argonautica
We approached the beach
And we bound the ship to the shore
With the rocks
Jason sent beloved crewmen from the ship
To go and inquire
Is what kind of men lived
In this great land
And to learn about the cities
And the settlements of the people
All right fine
But suddenly
There arrived the maiden sister
Of noble EETs
A daughter of Helios
Oh okay hold on
This is where it gets gorgeous
A daughter of Helios
Whom they call Cersei
Whose mother was
Asterope
Asterope and if you can
Eat and breathe
Ancient Greek
You know when you say
Asterope
You know who that is
Yeah
Gorgeous
This is
Gorgeousness
And Gorgeosity
And her father
Far shining Hyperion
The son
The son
She quickly came down to the ship
And what happened
All were struck
Dumb by the sight
Wait
Wait what
Yes
I'm going to show you this verb
And it precisely means that
To be struck
To the point of being incommunicado
Yeah
You cannot
You cannot reach out
You're stuck
I told you those angels
Take it down for a second
We'll bring it back
Those angels with the fingers
That smell
This one
They
Right
Right
Yeah it's those guys
If you trust those guys
You're going to end up seeing things
You're going to end up seeing things
You break those seals
Oh
You're going all the way
From alpha to omega
And that's exactly
What I am going to show you
How to go
Alpha to omega
This is awesome
Okay let's go
