Bring us up some more
This godless Greek
Okay no that one
Perfect perfect perfect
And then what happens
All were struck dumb by the sight
From her head
Hung hair like rays of light
Her beautiful face showing up
And her breath
Bright with flames
Okay pull it down
With flames
Oh man
I am so so
In that
Phoenician place
Yeah
Yeah
Those Canaanites dude
Oh my god
You should see the dance floors there
Okay
We can't go back to Armageddon
Right
We can't go back to Armageddon
Did I tell everyone
I'm going to take a little extra time
Satan will give me a discount tonight
I'll pay but not as much as
You have to worry about
Those dance floors
That you could discover
In of Canaanite temples
Yeah way under the stuff
The later ugly ages stuff
Which is what I call them
The darkness of the iron
Those were terrible times
Yeah
And their architecture was terrible
Anyway the good stuff that's underneath
The really good stuff like those
Canaanite dance floors
That's what we found
Canaanite dance floor
And those two guys got up
One night after another I was asleep
It's 2 a.m. I'm exhausted after
Carrying dirt all day long
And this guy sits up in bed
And the guy that's sleeping there
Asked me his name's Moshe
And he just starts talking like a
Like a growling mechanical dog
It sounded like
And I told him knock it off
Because he was saying weird stuff
And I was like okay enough
I thought he was joking or something
You know it was weird but
You know I don't know he's dreaming maybe
Anyway he runs off the next day
And has to be taken to a mental hospital
And another guy stays
The next night the other guy
He did the same thing
And what was funny
And he ended up running off the next day
The Israeli police went after him
But this is all in an excavation
Involved with the site of Armageddon
So when I first thought it was a joke
I couldn't the second night
When the guy did it the second night
And he said the same things
The first guy did
I was like alright as a scientist
If you're not into that
You're not into anything you know what I mean
