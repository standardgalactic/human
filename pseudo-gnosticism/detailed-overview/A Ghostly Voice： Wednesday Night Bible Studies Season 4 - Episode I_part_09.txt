And then he talks about, as the breasts of the proto-toku
no face.
Wait a minute, isn't that the same word we just saw?
Isn't Jesus one of those?
Yes.
Again, a title for that nursing nymph.
That nursing nymph.
Go ahead, take it down.
That nursing nymph, that fruitful goat.
Yeah.
Yeah, what are they talking about?
Remember, you had to be in their place to really understand.
You have to be in there as close as you can get in there.
This is not.
We've gone way past academic theories.
We don't need any academic theories.
Thanks, Harvard.
We don't need them.
Unproductive.
We need the text.
Give me another text.
Public text.
I've got to keep the string going.
This is too much.
Yes.
Who do we have here?
I just wanted you to see that we are talking about the kurei,
the kurei, the kora, the daughter.
Aetao, the daughter of Aetis.
Yes.
And who is she?
She is the polumejanos.
She is the polumejanos.
Take it down.
Polumejanos, where do we see the polumejanos?
We saw that in the very first line of the Orphic hymn.
The very first line of the Orphic hymn.
And these hymns predate Christianity
by at least six centuries.
I'd put it back more.
I'd go back to the eighth or ninth.
Yeah.
Based on the language.
Love it.
Love it.
OK.
Bring that last passage up again.
Yeah.
Polumejanos.
Go ahead, take it down.
Bring up after that.
Yeah.
I just wanted you to see here.
This is from Alice.
Hello, Alice in Wonderland.
It's nice to be with you.
It's nice to be with you.
Don't worry.
He was looking for something resourceful, inventive.
It's an epithet of Odysseus.
Right?
Odysseus is considered polumejanos.
It's used of Apollo.
Oh, and wait a minute.
When you combine it with the noun metered,
you're referring to nature.
Yes, that resourceful mother.
Yeah, gorgeous, gorgeous.
We have to remember that these mysteries,
that they're exercising in antiquity,
that these are coming from a tradition
and that that tradition is originally
based on late Bronze Age performance that
involved drugs and the queen of a people
and not one of these weak queens.
You look at the crown today, any of them in the world.
I'm not talking that.
I'm not talking that.
That's a joke.
I'm talking cercean so that you know.
That's right, take out.
Open that pouch and take out your purple.
Put it in your eyes.
You know how it works.
Put it in your eyes.
The angel will be coming in shortly.
Knock, knock, knock.
He's got the suppositories.
Don't worry.
Don't worry.
Right?
You've got the cercean, which is what they called it, right?
And at least in the first century,
they called it the cercean.
And the only reason we have that knowledge
from guys like Dioscorides and Scrobonius Largus
is that they had access to the emperors who
were preserving this.
Gustus is one of them.
Nero is one of them.
And now Yale and Harvard and not Princeton and Stanford.
Yeah, you people, Michigan, there's good people.
Jump.
Jump on this.
Look at the Andromachus.
Yes, look at Nero's position.
Yes, oh, it's such good stuff.
And it's so filled with code, right?
You didn't know before you came today
that a trochiscus was something you stuck in your rectum.
And it dissolved and gave you a vision.
You didn't know that, did you?
Well, they did.
This is how life went, right?
And it turns out there was a lot of good health.
There's a lot of good health stuff there.
Yeah, and we very foolishly walked away from it.
And the technology, now we've got the programming speeds.
Let's figure this thing out and bring her back.
And that way, we can all eat fetal pie, right?
I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding.
No, I'm not.
Hail Satan.
Go ahead and drink and whiskey.
