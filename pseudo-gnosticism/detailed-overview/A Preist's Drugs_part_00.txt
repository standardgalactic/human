I've got my D.
Don't miss a beat
I dream of Jeannie
Sugar sweet
She goes crazy
What's a girl to do?
Leggy, arm, arm, leggy
Madea and the Bikini crew
Got the mastic cake
The purple rain
All of Jaws full of Indica Jays
Gigi Penny wise on the strings
It's a mariachi thing
Out of 60 time witches
We're the ones with boys in these kisses
Out of 60 time witches
We're the ones with boys in these kisses
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
Boy, do we have something good for you tonight
Thanks to Teddy
Thank you, Teddy, for bringing us in
I'm going to let Teddy purify us as well
Bring them up the gateway
Yeah, the Teddy gateway
Let's do this
People, what are we...
What are we coming to? Take that thing down
They can go back and stop this
Excellent
What are we going tonight?
We've got to have our stuff together
Because this is deeper into the mystery
And anyone is gone
Deeper than anyone is gone
I need you to follow
I need you to sit on that throne
Be on that throne
And I need you to take the purification
Are you ready for this?
Are you ready?
I'm going to have Chewie roll us the purification tonight
Right off at the beginning
Because this is our chorus
This is our chorus
And our chorus is being brought to us tonight
by Teddy Bass
Hit it
Good going
Company of Whopper
House upon the hill
Put lightning on ya
Lawnmower man
Hot purple drawers
The wreck was strong
Boys in arrows
Dealing the tarot cards
Dancing to the bank
Water flows at the river's edge
This little chicka-dea I know
Coffee, baby
Mama-dea
Coffee, baby
Mama-dea
Coffee, baby
Mama-dea
Mama-dea
Mama-dea
Poison arrows
Black out the sky
Poison arrows
Dream time
Dancing to the bank
Crow and weed in the graveyard
Starks biggest Mount Everest
Put the tattoos on your head
Phosphorus
Light bearer
Cathode
Black goo
She's coming for you
Iambic pentameter
On the market leg
Exclaim the pattern
It is what I am
Hail Satan
Sombrero hats off
Don't be late
The wizard walks by
With a pointy hat
And a purple cane
Wake up
Isn't that nice?
Oh God, if we can bring her image back
I was looking for her the other day
I was looking for where'd she go
Where'd she go? Tonight
The object is to get off of the spaceship
Right? We got the time thing going
Get out of here
And what we're going to do is
We're going to go right to her
Going to go right to the Christ
Going right to her
God, I've got some stuff for you
You're not going to find this
You're not going to find this
Anywhere else
Yes, definitely
Here it is, people
And tonight we have several different ghosts
They're just going to jump on in
We're just going to free it up
We're just going to do it all the way
Let's do it
Bring my first
Bring him up
Look, what is this?
Who is this?
Oh, Gailen
Welcome, Gailen
We haven't had you here
Everybody had like you to meet
The personal body physician
Of Marcus Aurelius
Now, he had other connections
I'm not forgetting those
But that's really
That's really something to be proud of
Right?
Comedist, are you kidding?
Oh, shoot
Here he is
And he says, look, people
Now, I'm just going to
I'm just going to fill you in
I've got a work by a doctor
Who worked for Nero
He was his chief physician
And in it
Gailen says, look, he's about to give us
The work, right?
It's dactylic hexameter
And he's prophesying it
And he's saying, look, look
In it is your guy
Who loves what's beautiful, you know what I mean?
He's writing to a guy named Piso
And he says, hey
Hey, you're a good person, you know what I mean?
You want to know
You wouldn't want to be ignorant, you know
Unschooled in this kind of thing
But I want you to know, right?
They know how to mix these drugs
They're using the theriacs
Not just for the bites
But they're using them in the antidotes
Oh, God, give me the next one
You mean these christs are that steep
Into the drugs?
Yeah, yeah, I want to take you
Okay, wait, where is she?
I promised you I'd bring you her
This is Lady Babylon
Right, Lady Mystery
Go ahead, bring it up, Chewie
This is Lady Babylon
We have to bring it up
What's he doing here?
Get that junky Jesus out of here
Take your juice and get out of here
Go back with your boys
Back to the apostles, you creep
Okay, get him out of here
Run that Jesus off
That's what I do in Satanic congregation
