We're looking for that drink
Palma Medes
We're looking for her medicine
Who's medicine?
Lady medicine
What they call her over in Italy
Angetia, snake queen
Woo, love it
Let's go, because when you know all the toxins, right?
You're not afraid of getting bit
Love it, go to the next one
Boom, yeah
What are we talking about?
What kind of creatures are we going to be using
In our art, right?
As you're entering this cult performance
What kind of creatures are you finding?
Echios, right?
From the Echis
Vipers, you should be thinking about vipers
Next one, we're going to go through these faster
What else is there?
Cantaridon, right?
Cantaris, what is that?
It's a beautiful blister beetle
And you take that thing and you have a sustained satiriasis
Nobody knows who that is
Look that up, what is satiriasis?
You have that sustained
Those are your drugs from Pan, right?
Who's using them?
The Medwa, right?
Lady medicine is using them
Oh, God, you mean it was a title?
I thought it was a name
That's what they say
Go to the next one, love it
What else?
What are the kind of snakes?
The ones that make you bleed
This is the name for the snake they came up with
That makes you hemorrhage blood, right?
Oh, my God, hit the next one
Boom, and you can do with some of this people
If you're in antiquity and in this cult
Don't knock these bowls over as we're walking around
Yeah, conium maculatum, right?
Isn't that what they killed Socrates with?
We think it's what they killed Socrates with, right?
That's our good hemlock
Hemlock's not just a drug to kill you with, right?
It's an active participant in a complex process
Of making a compound
Love it, and look, we're going to watch Gaylen tell us
This is so exciting, cute
Nobody knows this stuff, by the way
People, these are all sources that nobody cares about
Aconyta, too
What is it?
What is it?
Akinite, monk's hood
Yeah, wolf's pain
You know what they call this one?
Oh, God, this is so sexy
Are you ready?
Yeah, leave that Akinite up there
That's gorgeous
Look at the petals, wouldn't you just like to stroke those petals?
That's gorgeous
What do they cause, man?
Stuff can kill you, right?
It's a deadly, deadly poison, right?
Shut you down
It'll make your circuits go boop
You will be in the nether
Oh, God, look at the beauty and the power of nature
Look at her
Look at her, right?
That's what the lady medicine has to be
She has to be that nature
You mean she's taking this stuff?
Yep
Yep, she is
Oh, God, what does it do?
Just wait, go to the next one
What else do we have in here?
We've got Hioskai, the henbane
Look, people, look, this is what they just found
You know, I told you about the library
They were able to start reading, right?
They're going to find the very same types of works
that I'm giving you
from the doctors and from the magicians
from the magic
They're going to find astrology
They're going to find it only
They're going to find that drug
They're going to find that beautiful, beautiful drug
This is wonderful
This one makes you crazy, man
Don't do that one, kids
Don't do any of these, right?
Because it's mint
It's mint for somebody who has a high, high, high level
of expertise, right?
And Galen tells us that
He says, some of these doctors, they can't
They can't pull this stuff out
You can put this thing and make a tea with it
and it's not going to hurt you
But if you have the right knowledge
of where on the plant to collect it
and how to make it into a compound
how to synthesize it, he says
Oh, my God, these theriacs, they're crazy
Crazy, did you know?
We are in the drug dark ages
ruled by barons of the economy
Yeah, by barons
And our drug knowledge isn't a one-hundredth
of what theirs was
Oh, my God, the complex systems there
You talk to a modern pharmacologist
and you ask him, what happens
when you put all of these things together
and you do this with them
And I don't know
Right
Is this the dark ages?
Yeah, we went back, didn't we?
Where's the classical sunrise?
Let's bring it, go
Boom, what else?
Opium
Opium, you've got to have your opium
Everybody out there
All the hop heads, hello
Hello to the hop heads, right?
This isn't your acetylated morphine
Right, but it's the raw stuff
that'll get you there, right?
Yeah, yeah, here it is
If you wondered why your dark goddess
was calling you
Oh, the empire got us in the track to be in there
Sorry about that, people
Yeah, it's okay
Let's go back to it
Where were we?
We were with a bunch of people using drugs
in the ancient world
and somehow Jesus was there with the snakes
Right?
Oh, my God
Jesus and the snakes?
Yeah, let's look at her one more time
Let's look at the woman
who came up with all of this
that spun off Judaism
that spun off Christianity
Oh, let's find her
Let's find her, go
Go to the next source
Oh, yeah
Look at this one, people
Yeah, this is the dark harbor
That's in the room
We've already been there
We're just people
You've got to remember
We're in the dark harbor
And you're not going to understand that
unless you've seen it
That's okay
We'll get them
Don't worry
