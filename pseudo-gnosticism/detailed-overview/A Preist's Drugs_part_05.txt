Oh, I didn't see him
Oh, I'm glad I didn't see him
That guy gives me a bad feeling
Let's go to the next text, people
We're only going to have a few more of these
Because tonight I don't want to keep you that long
And I wanted to give you something sweet
Like the sweetest nectar I could give you
What else are we going to put in this concoction?
We're going to put that nard
Just like Mary Magdalene had
And you can get this stuff
You can get this stuff from a Celtic dude
Some Galatian
Wait a minute
Are we in Bithynia or are we in Etruria?
Yes
The answer is yes
You mean we're all the way over in Italy
And at the same time all the way over in the Black Sea?
Yes
Why do you think they build temples too in Italy?
Right?
Right?
Those are Tyrenians
Those are Etruscans
You want to talk about a people
You mean there are Etruscans in Asia Minor?
Is Asia Minor off the coast of the Black Sea?
Isn't she beautiful?
Look at that finger coming down in the carousel
Right?
Look at that finger
Oh God, you know what that is?
That's where she lives
That's where she lives
Everybody that's along this coast
Look at the western coast of Turkey
Right?
This is Asia Minor in antiquity
Right?
There's no Turkey then
This is Asia Minor
And who?
Who are the people all along the coast?
They're Ionian Greeks
Ionian Greeks
Yeah
And those people who are up on the Black Sea
Just up on the north there
Those people in those tribes
They're the ones who have the sophistication with the drugs
They make us look like we're going backwards
It's not amazing
They have a connection with the Greeks
They are spreading
Their people are spreading
What do they call those Aryans?
Well, now they call them Meads
Yeah
Yeah, they do
Look, dude, they were all on horseback
You gotta give them a break
You gotta give them a break
I want to say something, by the way
I want to take that down for a second
And I want to just say
We've never kicked anybody out of the chat room
Not even
I was tempted a couple of times
With some misogynistic stuff
Because there's absolutely nothing productive
It's only control that can come of that
Right?
And we don't want
We don't want any of that
Any of those invaders
Right?
But I let everybody speak
But Chewie got a little bit excited
And blasted somebody
Yeah, so
Goodbye
Goodbye
No more warnings
We don't have to warn anymore
Sit down
Be quiet
Right?
Because somebody stepped over the line
How do you step over the line
In the Satanic congregation?
Number one, you're dishonest
If you are dishonest
And you say things that aren't true
You got no place with Saturn, baby
The Saturnian age doesn't accept pollution
Right?
Pollution gets purged
So you angered Chewie
And Chewie pulled out his blaster
And off you went
Love it
Love it
Let's keep the people here
Hell Satan
Everybody out there
Hell Satan
I'm going to get to your comments tonight
Okay, I want to purify us again
Because I want to take what I've shown you
And I want you to feed it in
To this chorus
This Orphic chorus
Along with its images
Chewie hit us with Medea again
Dream with Athena
I grew up in the house of Satan
You're going to have to make a better opera
I'm on this hot track
With a stuffy like Medea
The Sorceress
Hold the ghost home to your faces
With drugs it's laced
I'm in the tree line
In the Gagore
Company and Whopper
House up on the hill
Putting Lightning on you
Lawnmower man
Pop purple drawers
Direct with straws
Boys in arrows
Dealing the tarot cards
Dancing to the bank
The water flows just to rip this edge
This little chicka-dee I know
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Love you baby
Poison arrows
Black out the sky
Poison arrows
Dream time
Dancing to the bank
Crow and weed in the graveyard
Starks big as Mount Everest
Put the tattoos on your head
Phosphorus, light bearer
Cathode, black goo
She's coming for you
Iambic pentameter
On the bark of legs
Exclaim the pattern
It is what I am
Hail Satan
Sombrero hats off
Don't be late
The wizard walks by
With a pointy hat
And a purple cane
You have asphalt on
I cannot take you
I have to take you there
This is the intimate of the intimate
This is the inner chamber baby
And that's where we go
What did you think this was all about?
That inner chamber
That antrum? That's it
That's where she is
That's where you'll find
