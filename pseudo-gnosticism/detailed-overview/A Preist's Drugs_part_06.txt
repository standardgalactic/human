Lady Medea
Go to the next one
Boom
Excellent
There it is
Okay, people, look at this really quick
Who are we? Who's our sponsor tonight?
In all of this activity
Oh, there we are
It hurts every time you do that
It's like a dimensional shift
Stop it, Chewie
Look at the end of the first line, people
We're looking at Pion
Who is Pion?
Well, here he's given specific
kind of
epithets, right?
He's given very specific
We can see him, emerge
This is the great physician
What am I rambling about?
The great physician
Don't you remember when Jesus is all walking around
Heal people, casting out demons
Stuff like that
Being the great physician
This is who we're addressing
This comes from Medea's work
In the late Bronze Age
Yes, the divine physician
You Boneheads was first
A woman
Can you imagine that?
Can you imagine worshipping
A divine physician woman?
Oh, God
Where is she?
I want that, right?
Where is she? Bring her back
Bring her back, love it
Hit us with the next source, please
Chewie, got a little
He gave me, hit my head last time
On the top of the screen
Okay, look people, I just want to bring up
Nicander, and I want to show you a couple
of things from this priest
Look at this, look at the, look at
On the fourth line, Lexia
He says, look brother, he's talking about
He's basically writing
A poetic letter to a friend
Of his, right? And he's writing
It in meter
I mean, this guy is
Genius, and his work ultimately
Becomes the basis for
Much of the science of
Rome, right?
They're all stealing from him
Cicero is stealing from him, right?
Quoting him plenty, stuff like that
And what does he call it? He says, look, I can
I know, he's living
In that western coast
Turkey, you know
Asia Minor, he's living there
And what is he doing?
He says, look, I've got your curatives
I know
What the antidotes are
For the drugs that people are using
In ceremonies, right? We've got him
And he starts to go through a list
But he says, look, this is going to take you to a place
This is going to take you to a place
From which you're not going to come back
It's the chasm
It's the rift of Eubulius
Wait, what?
It's the rift of Eubulius
You're listening to a priest
Talk about
Entering people into the right
This is a place
That you're going to go
To everybody who's under the influence
Right now, that you're watching
In the room
They're going to the chasm
Of Eubulius
Yeah
Yeah, fantastic
Hit us with the next one
What are we going to do, people
If we're able to get out
You can't escape
The place
Except
With the Alexifonmicon
What is that thing? It's an antidote
Look at number two here
See where it says, look at the pharmacon
It's a way to describe the pharmacon
That's what he's doing
When I say
That Jesus Christ is involved
You blow it up
This is disturbing, I have to tell people this
I keep saying in interviews
And I've got a couple of
I've had some good interviews
And I've got a couple more coming up
So when you tell
These people that Christ
Is a pharmacological term
And that Christianity
Is a
Cult right
Of a mystery that is using
Drugs
They look at you funny
Because they're coming to us from
La La Land
This is wonderland to them
This is the fairy tale
This is Jesus with his little
You know, his entourage
Of 35 year old white men
With beards
Yeah
This is that fairy tale
That their mind
Is consumed with
The scales over their eyes
Turn them into a horde
That wants to kill children
While raising flags
That say, we're the protecting the children
Yeah
And then they're killing them
That blood
Soaked into that eye
That will take off those scales, man
You'll see who you are
Do you know what the Bacchic initiation
Does?
It shows you who you are
It's a mirror
It's a mirror people
I want you to remember that
Everybody in satanic initiation
That Bacchic initiation
Is a mirror
We are still
Honoring Apollo
We are still honoring
He who strikes from afar
He who carries the arrows
Did you wonder why Jesus Christ
Riding into the apocalypse
Is on a horse and has arrows
Did you wonder that?
I am showing you
Eden
I'm showing you where that came from
And it came from a woman
It came from a woman
I love it
Do you see her?
She's a little bit afraid
She's got a cup for you
She's got a cup
Let's go to the next one
Poison me baby
