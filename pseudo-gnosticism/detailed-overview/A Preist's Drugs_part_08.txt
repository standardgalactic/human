Anyone
Fantasics
This is theophrastus
Christians would never
Be interested in
Aristotle
Plants
Aconite
Aconite
It is on Crete
With all those liars
And it isn't Zakenthus
But the best of it
Aristotle
Is in Heraclea
In the Pontus
This is Pontic
Pontic Aconite
That's the best stuff
Theophrastus has already told us that
He's a student of Aristotle
Now here's what's cool
Give me the next one from that
It says
Oh, look, oh here
This one just butted in
What did you say in the candor
Look at that first line
Hey, those of you who want to know
Here's the formula
Here is the divine communion
I'm showing it to you people
Look at the first line
The last word
The circle
This is the fire of Medea
Colchian Medea
When she comes
When Lady Babylon comes
With that cup
That's when you know Christians
Put your mark on
Put your mark on your head
He's not going to take you
It's just the way it is
It's in the text, baby
Let's bring up Jesus
We need Jesus
It's 758
In my zone
We need Jesus
All the way down to Jesus, please
Yeah, this is Matthew
And what was that? This stuff was all
Supposed to be fulfilled by the prophets
Those people
Who were on the drugs in the first place
Right?
This guy's going to cause us to
He's going to heal us
And he's going to cause us to
Not have any sort of illness, right?
Right? What is this guy going to do?
Right?
Go, go to the next one
He's going to tell us
Hey, whoever believes and is baptized
Is going to be saved
And those who don't
They're going to be judged
That's him, right out of the mouth of Jesus
Thank you Jesus
Now tell us, what do you mean? Who are the Christians?
And who are not now?
And I'm issuing a challenge
To those of you who watch
To the sisters of frustration
To those of you who watch because
You secretly wear those monks
Underwear
I want you to see what a real
Christian is. Are you ready?
And all you dogs in the congregation
All you wolves out there
Keep barking baby
Keep barking because this is it
Go to the next one
Who is that Christian?
Yeah, there are certain characteristics
Right?
What are these people going to do?
They're going to cast out demons
They're going to cast out demons in my name
And they're going to what?
They're going to speak in these
New languages, right?
Because you haven't heard this stuff
You mean is that tongues?
Yeah, yeah it is
And tongues is not a current
Written language? Nope
Nope, it's not
And what else
Marks these Christians?
What else do Christians do?
When you go to your church this weekend
And you're standing there
In the general church
Waving to invisible Jesus
Right and praising
You got your hand out
And people are swaying
Yeah and oh we love you Jesus
Do you do this?
Because if you don't, you're not a Christian
Go to the next one
What is it? Oh my god
You're going to raise up serpents
And you're going to drink
Thanassimon
Thanassimon is the word
That I keep saying
On the medical side that is
Those poisonous concoctions
That are meant within the mystery
To put you into a state of death
And bring you out
Into new life
You'll be able to do that
If you are a Christian
Those of you who are sitting there
Your faith is meaningless
Your faith is meaningless
If you are not raising up serpents
If you are not
Taking
A communion
That is a death bringer
You're not a Christian
And you're not doing it at dawn
And it's probably why
You are a member of the sisters of frustration
Your faith is meaningless
Says Jesus Christ
Right
What does the devil insist on?
Honesty
Honesty
You want this don't you
You want it
Go to the next one
And then I want to yell at the crowd
That was it, pull me up
It gets my goat that we
I kept people for so long
It gets my goat, hail Penelope
We love you Penelope
She's so gorgeous
I love her godiness
Now I'm going to give you an opportunity
Because we just have a couple of minutes
And I'm going to play us out with
Our exit
I want to ask people in the audience
Because I want people to know
I want people to know that I'm paying attention
I go back and I read your comments
I read your comments
Chewie are there any outstanding comments
That we need to put in there
Yeah how about that one
No how about that one
What does that mean
Yeah
I'm not sure are you okay
It sounds like you're having fun
