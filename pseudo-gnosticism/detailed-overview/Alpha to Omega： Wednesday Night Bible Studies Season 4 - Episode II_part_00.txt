Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burnin'
Do my veins, Indian goes crazy
And the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've got your sellin' and you got your drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah, drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah
Tonight I've got what you want
This is the good stuff that you've been waiting for
So pull out that throne
Take a seat on it
Enter those deep things of Satan with me
Tonight we're going to look
At the mystery itself in operation
I'm gonna take you directly to that spot
And let you be witnesses
Lovely
That, we've got a couple of great, great clips
Welcome to Lady Babylon Bible Study
So, now we've got to set the stage
We've got to get into our ship
We've got to go back
We're gonna go back to the contemporary first
We're gonna go back to the contemporary first
We're going to look at a right in performance
In actual performance
This is something that some people will hold up in front of your face
They will sell it
They will talk about it, but they will never unseal it
Tonight we're unsealing it
