And they're shocked
And they're like
No
And you know
No matter what I say
People always come back to me
And say
You know what
You were right
You were right
And you know
They end up finding a source
Or something
Right
I'm not here to lie
Right
And I'm not making any money
Off of this
Right
You don't have to watch
20 commercials
I don't have to try to sell
You hand soap
Or something
I don't want to
Right
I'm bringing you this
Right
Because that's what the devil said
To do
So look
What is this thing?
It's the toxicon
It's a passage from a Greek physician
A Byzantine physician
And what is he doing?
He's describing different drugs
That are being used
And their cures
And how to treat the symptoms
And he talks about the toxicon
I just want to translate for you
I've never been translated into English
Right
So all of you
Harvard
And all of you
Know-it-alls
Right
Thank you
You know everything
You've never seen this
Right
You've never seen this
This is brand new baby
This is Paul
Paul of Ejina
Show me
Paul of Ejina
Ejina is an island
I love it
So many beautiful islands
We all need to go there
The entire congregation
Will be invited in the future
To a grand celebration in Greece
Time is coming
We will be there
We will be there
Oh, God
I appreciate you, congregation
I appreciate you
And everything that you do
That people don't even see
That's going on
I love it
I love it
This is fantastic
So tell us about this toxicon
Oh, great
Paul, tell us about this
And he says, well, you know
The name of the drug
Seems to come from the fact
That they are Christing
Their arrows in the poison
They're what?
They're Christing them
Look at that second line
Right
Fifth word in
Kriestai
That's what they're doing
Do you understand that Christ
Is a pharmacological term
In antiquity
Jesus didn't pop up
And all of a sudden it was there
Oh, I'm a Christ
What? You're what?
Who's that?
No, it's been around
It's been around since Medea
We all know that
By the way, I went on
Walking dead
No, um, raising
No
Hang on
Oh, my God
Wake the dead
Did you hear that voice?
That was a soft voice
In the distance there
Oh, my God
Wake the dead
Okay, so that was a lot of fun
Thank you
Thank you, Sean
Everybody
Get in there
And love it
I hope you like it
I hope you like it
You're my biggest critics
So thank you
Okay, let's go to the next
Yes, that one
Okay, so tell us about the Toxicon
Tell us about it
Now I'm gonna put these on
Leave them on and read it to you
People are like, hey
What is that guy doing?
Okay, it's called the Toxicon
Because they go ahead and they
Christ their arrows with it
But for those who drink it
Their lips and their tongues swell up
And they get a mania
That is uncontrollable
Where they see all sorts of hallucinations
And on account of this, right
The therapy is impossible
They're impossible to deal with
And rarely can you save somebody
When they've drunk it like this
Oh, my God
And what do you have to do?
Tell me, Doc
What do you do?
Can you feel yourself there, right?
What do you do for this person?
You put chains on them
And you force them to throw up
Using emetics
And he gives a whole list of things
That you're gonna have to force this person
To force this person to drink and vomit
And then there's all sorts of plants
That they want you to give him
To deal with it, to try to counteract
But he says, here's the problem
Here's the problem
This is the beauty at the end of this passage
Right, here's the problem, he says
There are some that escape the danger
Of this drug
And those people, they end up bedridden
And when they can finally get up
There's something wrong with them
For the remaining time
Their remaining time
They are in a state of constant paranoid terror
Oh, my God, seriously
What did you do to them?
What did you do to these people's brains, brah?
What are they doing in antiquity to people's brains?
Holy mackerel
I thought that whole story of that Bronze Age queen
Who was poisoning people
And castrating them
And turning them into sex toys
That she would beat mercilessly
That they were always in a state of total abject servitude
Wow, you can actually make that kind of person?
Yeah, yeah, it's getting deep
It's getting deep
Look, for those of you who have weak stomachs
Now's the time, take out your vomit bags
And we'll make our way into it
Let's get to the next one
I got some chunkiness here, people
I know you'd love it
Where's the chunkiness?
Oh, yeah, bring it in
That's the next one, yeah
Look, for those of you who are in my Greek course
And come to Dojo and work out
Look, you can see hermaphroditus at the top of it
This is on hermaphrodites
He's a doctor, dude
Give him a little credit
And he says, hey, and you know
I had the privilege of sitting down with a student of mine in Greece
Who is also a doctor
And she was able to talk this
Talk me through this
Flash up some diagrams, the development
And what happens?
Oh, boom, bam, bam
There it is, nature all lined out
Hermaphrodite, what happens here?
I want you to just thank for a minute
The conclusion here
At the end, we're going to end up
Performing some surgery
In order to create the best
Of the four different types of genders
That hermaphrodites have
And you're like, what?
What?
Yeah, he says, just wait
And none of that
He says, somebody else is writing about this, right?
Apparently it's common enough
At the time for the doctors around
To be aware of, you know
Hey, there are four types of hermaphrodites, right?
Depending on positioning
The genitalia, and he talks about positioning
And I'm scratching my head, doc
Can you make sense of this?
Right?
Oh, but we end up
We end up doing a little surgery
Isn't that nice?
Artificial insemination
And gender surgery
Did you know they did that in antiquity?
In the society that created calculus
With their words?
Did you know that?
These are the people who said
We go around in the sun
Wow, isn't that amazing?
You'd think they would have been able
To beat that out of people in the Middle Ages
Thank you so much to the people
Thank you so much to the Christians
In the Middle Ages, yes
Oh, he's going to blame Christianity
I'm just blaming the Christians
Who at the time were torturing
And killing people for their beliefs
Right?
To those people who made the Middle Ages
Such a dump
My apologies to medieval historians
But your period is a dump
Yeah, it is
Thank the muse that there was
Some Byzantine scholars
To stand in your way
Oh, God
Where does my allegiance lie?
Lies with the muse in the museum
Love it, let's go to the next one
Or to the Hermaphrodite
Let's just finish off a couple of...
I just wanted you to notice
A couple of things about the Hermaphrodite here
That's all
We have to consider
That of these four types
The genders are going to be determined
Very anatomically and very logically
But we don't have any problem
This is not something that is fatal
Determining gender is a process
That the ancient physician has to be a part of
Isn't that interesting?
Wow, it's gorgeous
But remember, their technology is way beyond
Where you think it was
Their chemical technology is way beyond that
Okay, so let's go to the next one
I want to shock at all people
Boom
Okay, people, look what else I brought
This is just dirty, dirty stuff
Are you ready?
And when I mean dirty
I mean intellectually dirty
Don't be foul, right?
Love it
Take a look at this
What is this?
This is about the numphotomia
What is that?
That's the nymphotomy
Numphae, as we have already seen
As my Greek students know
Is translated as clitoris
What he says here is
Hooper meghethis
What happens?
A hooper meghethis
Numphae genetai
It comes about
This ginormous clitoris
Sometimes is the result
Of the hermaphroditic thing
Boom
And this thing, he says
This clitoris, imagine this
Imagine this
A clitoris that he says
