Becomes wrecked
Just like a penis
Fantastic
Can you imagine that?
What a brilliant bit of nature
That's amazing, that's amazing
Fantastic
What it is, there it is for you to see
Right, and remember these hermaphrodites
They are part of the religion
If you cut hermaphroditism
Out of the ancient mystery
It won't stand
You can't have it, sorry
You can't have it
Remember, Aphrodite
The very earliest depictions
Put some Aphrodite up there, please, Chewie
The very earliest depictions of Aphrodite
Are of her with what looks like a penis
And for all of you biologists out there
Who do not have, you know
Who have public decency
You know that the same tissue
That the clitoris is
Becomes the penis, right
The default is the female, right
We were all females, I'm sorry
But at one point we were all females
And then with the testosterone
Hit some of us and screwed things up
Yeah, isn't that funny
We're a degenerate form, biologically
The masculine form is the degenerate
It only makes sense, x, y, y
Point that little chromosome
It's damaged, right
Yeah, don't you love that
So, oh, right, x, x, y
Love it
Let's do, let's go to the
Let's go back to the text
And we don't need to go back to the
What do they do, surgically
They do what they consult
With the parents would be the best thing
Right, he says you're doing it
With the sense of propriety
For the child, right
And so they decide what to do
And in one case it's
When your clitoris is huge
Like a penis
Then they will cut part of it off
And shape it
So that it returns to approximate
You know, an average clitoris
Or as close as they can get
Right, remember they're nipping
And tucking the scrotal tissue as well
Right, these are people who
Just that physician that we were looking at
Paul of vagina, he's known for being
The best guy to repair hernias
Right, so if he knows how to repair hernia
He probably is also repaired
A few scrotal tissue things
And tucked him here
And the perineum is right there
And he mentions the perineum, right
This is where we are
Down zero is the perineum
Okay, okay, fantastic
We're well within, does everybody
See the right going on
Does everybody hear the music, right
See the right, is you sitting on your throne
Oh god, I love this, let's go back
Thank you people for indulging me
And I know Gnostic is there waiting
We're getting close to being done
Go, hit the next one
I want everybody to get all of this
Look people, what is a Christ
It's a medical term, medical term
These are the things that you Christ
For those poisons that you get
From the things that creep around
What we would call reptiles
And also from those poisonous venomous animals
These are the boy themata
These are the things, the cures
That we're going to use, right
These are the, if you want to say
Remedy there, maybe antidote
But it's not quite that last word
Boy themata, that's what the antidote brings you
It brings you assistance
It brings you protection
That is what the author of the Septuagint
Calls Eve
She is that thing for the Adamas
And oh, wait a minute
Wait a minute, was Adamas
Was that the point, was that the point
She had done it with the devil
Right, because we all know
Who's the most handsome, who's the most handsome
Most handsome creature, anywhere
Anywhere, who is it, it's the devil
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
So Eve then took it to Adam
And did what she was supposed to have done
But what Yahoo was trying to keep to himself
Isn't that interesting, the devil's like
No, no, no, you won't die, right
You won't die, your eyes will be open
Yeah, and they ended up naked, right
Because that's the way it is
In these rites they're going to end up naked
I'm going to show you a naked grown-up man
With Jesus at the end tonight
Okay, give it, let's, people want it
People want to see Jesus
You want to see Jesus with a naked grown-up man
Who's high on drugs, are you ready
We're going to love it
Go, hit the next one
I just wanted to bombard you with a few of these
Look, Thediyakos, I just want you to notice
About four lines down
We talk about the Fatimaka
That are the Thediyak, right
That are that venom-derived curative
Yeah, venom-derived curative
This stuff's going to heal you, bro
Go to the next one, excellent
And what is this?
This is the Malaktikos
That's in a mall, look, look, look
It's in a malliant
And what is there in parentheses?
Chrismata, Chrismata
This is, again, we're using the same base
But these are all different types of drugs
All different types of drugs
That they're applying a very specific way
Hit the next one
They're talking about these
These go back, way back
You're Hyoschymus
Dr. Goot, you're Hyoschymus
That we're talking about
You're Hinbein, you're Hinbein
Guess what, man
They're talking about that in the Iliad
In the Iliad
It's a Bronze Age fat
Look at the drugs, baby
Follow the drugs
That's the way to go
I love it, I love it
That's what we're doing
Look, people, we can never go wrong
If we just always follow the concrete evidence
In this case, it's the drugs
The drugs cut through all of the BS of the culture
They cut through everything
They get right down to the biological
Oh, God, I love it
Love it, nature, she's gorgeous
Let's go to the next one
And finally, the Sunkrisma
Look, it's so specific
You can make different types of these Christings
Different forms of Christings
I love the iChristing the best
They talk about it in different drugs
You can compose these ointments
And they put them in the eye
Right?
Wait, what?
Didn't Jesus spit in your eyes?
Well, he spit in the dirt first
Then he put that
And then he put that, right?
Spit in my mouth, spit in my mouth, Jesus
Spit in my mouth
It gets my goat
That nobody wants Jesus to spit in their mouth anymore
It really gets my goat
Something is wrong with that
Bring her up
Hello, Penelope
It's good to see you
Oh, I love you so much
I love Penelope
She's my righteous goat, brother
Right?
She's got that mark
Okay, let's go
Let's go to the next one
By the way, Christians
Get your heads tattooed
Right?
It's only 144,000 of you
That are going to escape the wrath
And you've got to have the name on your forehead
That's it
Okay, good
And we showed the beast last week
Wasn't that lovely?
Okay, let's go
What is he talking about?
It's okay, Martha
Go, hit it
Look at this
Oh, Crima, there's one
One more, one more, one more
It's also a Crisma
Right?
An Anguint
An Anguint
Ew, look at that
Look at that
It's all the way down in iamblicus
Right?
He talks about it, too
You mean these?
I thought he was a philosopher
No, he's more like a historian of magic
And the physics of magic
And he's, of course, he's got to be into the drugs
Because everything that they're doing
Is circling the drug, the pill box
Oh, God
You can't get...
This stuff is all over the place, people
They're going to find out in the archaeological dig
Let me tell you what's coming next
It's getting dirty
It's getting dirty
That's what I'll say
Let's go to the next one
We fulfill prophecy
Isn't that nice?
Beholdeth thou me
Periton Alonso and Crisma
Concerning all those other Christing drugs
Oh, nice
Look, you've got entire sections
This is a section title of a medical work
You've got an entire section about Christings
Jesus did not appear on the scene
And walk up and they said, hey, who are you?
And he said, well, I'm Christ
And they were like, huh?
Right?
No
That word had been around for centuries
And people say, now wait, now watch
Behold the lie
And people, this is the one...
Let me just stop for a minute and say
This is the one that's really getting people right now
In these interviews that I'm giving
This is the one that's getting them
Is the fact that the Septuagint's written in the third century
And that it's originally written in Greek
And that your words like Christ
They have nothing to do with Messiah
They have nothing to do with a Messiah
Or anointing
No, they don't
They don't
The Christing is a completely different process
It was the people who wanted to control the narrative
Namely, the Orthodox Jews and the Christians
Right?
Those people needed to create a narrative
And the one that they created is so absurd
That even the Greeks and Romans standing around looking at them
Said, are you joking?
Your narrative is stupid and impossible
Right?
We're historians here
We don't play in fancy and fantasy
What are you talking about?
Oh, God
So, no, it turns out that Christ, that word Christ
Is not
It's got nothing to do with any sort of tradition
Outside of the mystery tradition
Where the Christ is a term that is used
For the dude who is drugged out of his mind
Yeah
Who has that...
What was it?
It was the breast bud of God
And when I say God, I don't mean he
Yeah
Yeah
You know how they get that?
They get that with the venom
They get that with the venom
Well, what do you call her?
Yeah
Oh, isn't that amazing?
Isn't that amazing?
Now you're starting to see Dionysus in a totally different light
You know what I mean?
Oh, God, I love you people
Thank you so much for giving me this time
And Neil, thank you for waiting
I'm almost there
I'm going to fly through a couple more
I want you to see
Oh, I need 10 minutes
