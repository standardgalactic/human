How much do you know about the same one
Thracian Mysteries?
Huh?
What about Symezias?
Huh?
What about the Thracians?
What about like
What we can go into like
All this stuff that never gets talked about
By any Bible scholars ever
Right
Ever
What about the Theosipsistos
In the 2nd century BC
What about that?
What are you talking about?
Yeah
They don't know
Like this is like gibberish to them
It's they don't
They're not
None of them
In their whole 8 to 10 years of going to school
This stuff doesn't even get brought up
It's only in the classes this world
Yeah
No
I saw both worlds, Neal
I got my degree in classics
And taught in classics
And I taught at a seminary
And I can tell you for a fact
It's giving them the ability
To be able to go back to those texts
That thing is revolutionary
We can give somebody the ability
To see the history
For what it was
Not through any kind of filter
That's based on theology
Or any ideology
But just the facts of the history
Just the real sauce
You liberate them
You liberate them
The best thing you could do for Christianity
Is to give them leaders
Who could actually read those texts
Sure
I tell my students
Every semester that I was in seminary
I'm not there anymore
Because as you know
You know, they thought that I
Somebody saw me fly through some walls
And do some magic
Which whatever
You know, it's all inadmissible, right?
So
When you're in that situation
As a classist
You can see how important it is
That they're able to find
That source
And work with the source
And Christians don't do that
I've never met
I've not met one yet
That is a real master
Of classical Greek and Latin
Never
Never
So we'll see
We'll see what happens
Maybe that's a challenge
One last thing
Tell us
One last thing about this
Then I want to show you some stuff
About Adam and Adam
I have some stuff on that
Kyle Ruck
Was the first to really do
What you're doing right now
And go into the trenches
And challenge some of this shit
So if you read his book
The Road to Eleusis
The book that was heavily criticized
And shot down
And then vindicated over time
As these
As classics caught up to him
Basically, that's kind of funny
If you think about it
It's true
Classics caught up to Kyle Ruck
How does one person get so
You see, smarter than everyone else
Is he got a higher IQ?
No, it's not that
He's reading the text
He's immersed in the world of Greek
He loves it
He does it for fun
This is the difference between
Somebody who just goes to college
To be a professor
And they just read modern articles
From modern scholarship
And think that's all you have to do
And then don't read the primary sources
So I'll give you an example
At the end of his book
The Road to Eleusis
He talks
There's a debunking section
At the end
It's in the appendix
And he talks about the current
Archaeologist
He names the guy
I forgot the person's name
Some sort of professor
PhD archaeologist
Who was digging up
Eleusis
And this guy starts talking about
There is no connection
To Demeter and Dionysus at all
We haven't found anything
In the archaeology
And Kyle Ruck was like
Dude, even if that's true
That you found nothing
In Eleusis of Dionysus
You're just wrong
This is what the sources say
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom
Just obliterates them
With the primary text
Strabo says this
By the way
Yacos is a term
It's a name for Dionysus
It's also a name for Demeter
And only them two shared that title
No one else
You don't see that with Apollo
Nobody else
So it's like
Yeah
Maybe you have an understanding
Of the archaeology
And you're looking at the data
The raw data
And you say
All I see is this
So therefore it's all that
This is one of those things
Where you think about
If a tree falls down
In a place that no one's there to see it
Then it happened
And the answer is yes, it happened
But now how do we find that?
We have to find out how to document stuff
That's not necessarily like
We have to be able to connect the dots
And we have to be able to do
Interpret the data
And by the way, Damoclin always says this
In the data
He always says in the data
Which is fine
The data doesn't always mean
You're going to find it saying
Adamus is where Adam comes from
You're not going to find a text that says that
You have to do the work
And you have to read the text
And interpret the data
To find this stuff out
So that's what I'm getting at
I'm saying some of this stuff
Might sound speculative
But then we will
We're talking about the data as a whole
Then it starts to make sense
When you're immersed in these texts
This stuff makes more sense
That's all I'm saying
I'm not saying I'm smarter than everybody
Or I'm not an expert
And they're not
I'm just saying there's certain things
Where if you are
And this is just being a nerd, actually
You can find Star Wars nerds
Who know more about Star Wars
Than some of the directors of Star Wars
Probably
Because they're just like super nerdy at it
And those could go
Wait a minute
Actually Darth Vader said this
Oh, shit
I did write that
And that's the thing
Like sometimes being very immersed
And loving this stuff
For just as
Because that's a part of who you are
Gives you that upper
Like that Kaurak advantage
Yeah
And you know what?
That's why you gotta love the guy
And his draw to that
That language
And those texts
Is so strong
You can see it in his eyes
There's a tenderness about him
And it's a beautiful, beautiful love
For that beauty that is classical Greek
He swims in that
And he has so much
You don't understand the ground
That Karl Ruck has covered
Right?
People out there
Like Kip and Dan
They have studied more than he's forgotten
Right?
I mean he's
I said that backwards
He's forgotten more than they have studied
Probably
I mean he's that close
He really respects the muse
Karl Ruck is a man
Who followed the muse his life
And I have tremendous respect for him
Here's to you
Here's to you, Lukamo
For what you've brought
And he was
You're right, Neil
He was standing in the breach
Right?
When those other classes were back
Just securing their jobs
And getting a little bit of fame
That they could possibly get
They were saying harsh things about him
They were like really going after his character
Like assassinating his character
Being beyond the scholarship
Like he was getting so much hate
For the stuff that he was producing
In his text
And then all of a sudden
20 years goes by
And then there's more research being done
Into entheogens
And Elzinian mysteries
And Greek mystery cults
All of a sudden it's like
Holy shit
Everything he's been saying
Is coming to light
And like all those people who criticized him
20 years ago look like morons
That don't know the material
And I predict that 20 years from now
This is what we're going to be saying
About scholars in the SPL
That's what I'm saying
Yeah, totally
I totally agree
I totally agree
Okay, Neil
Tell me really quick
What is the new area that you're going to be working on
For your next video?
I just want like
It's coming along quick
It's coming along quick
Okay, I just
I'm almost done with it already
I'm coming along quick
I have the whole 10,000 word
Script written out
10,000 words
It's about the Pulaskians
Proto-Indo-Europeans
Scythians, Thracians
Celts
Germanic Pagans
Italic Pagans
Going all the way to India
Into the Hindu stuff
And I'm doing
And I'm showing how all this stuff is connected
That's my next video
I already have
I already started recording it on the microphone
I'm already halfway through it
It's going to be out quick
I hope
I hope you do the Pulaskians
Oh, it's all
I introduce them as the Pulaskians
I basically say in the video
Whether you want to call them Pulaskians
Eurasians
