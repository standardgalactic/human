describes a different type of paganism.
In times of cataclysm
such as the invasion of the 7th century
fortune tellers and seers
do a windfall business.
The canon catalogs several types of diviners.
Alright, so you get the point.
I'll put a link in the description
for Chewie to put in the description. People can read this for themselves.
But the point is
they are anti-freedom.
They are passing canons
all throughout the dark ages
saying you can't laugh,
you can't chant your gods,
you can't... all this stuff is illegal.
So it says right here
um
Priests of Delphi
in a regular fashion resembling that of
the Priests of Delphi.
That was
condemned as illegal
from the 60th canon.
They probably did for private gain.
Women practiced this.
So the Priests of Delphi is not illegal.
The pagan deities were regarded as demons,
being possessed,
actually possessed.
So they're basically, okay, freedom is
longer allowed. No more laughing,
no more chanting to your gods,
no more agricultural rituals.
That is now illegal.
So all this stuff is in here for people to
co-read it for themselves.
I also want to um
I want to show some people some stuff real quick.
So Liber.
That's Dionysus in the
Latin. That's where you get the word
liberal from.
Liberty.
Yesterday and today,
July is a day of liberty.
They had their own festival called
Liberalia.
But ours in America is July 4th.
It's the Liberalia of America.
Now,
people are probably wondering what was going on with that song,
right?
So I'm going to share one more screen
real quick.
And I want someone, I just want to show you guys something
real quick.
So
if you don't mind,
I'm going to pull something up real quick.
Um,
one second.
Inauguriantic song.
All right.
This is one more couple more things I want to show you.
This is the banger now. So this is called the
Inauguriantic song. You might have heard this before
when Chewie pulled up that
thing. Now,
what is this song, right?
Well, I'm just going to play you the tune first
and then I'm going to immediately recognize
what it sounds like.
So everyone knows
what that is, right?
That's the Star Spangled Banner, right?
Well, no, the Star Spangled
Banner
doesn't exist until
1960.
This is the original
song of liberty
called the Inauguriantic song.
So first, before I even play the song,
I want to, I want to explain
something first.
All right. Who is
who is, uh, first of all, who is Inaugurious,
right?
Inaugurion
is an ancient Greek
language, right?
We're talking about
6th century BCE
to the 5th century BCE.
He was a Greek lyric poet
notable for his drinking songs
and erotic poems. He honored
Dionysus, right?
And as you're going to find out,
all right, so that's just a quick, you guys can look
them up yourself. I want to
speed through and get to the
best part about this. The Inauguriantic
song is an 18th
century song from
a secret organization
of freedom lovers, of
worshipers of Dionysus and
Venus.
Secret
society, if you will, amongst
not just Americans, but in England as well,
especially in London.
London and Washington had this connection
under the Inauguriantic
banner, which is the song you just
heard. The lyrics of this song
are this.
To Inauguriant in heaven,
few sons of harmony sent
to petition. The Myrtle
and Venus with Bacchus' vine
and you get like the yellow-haired
god in his nine-mutt
fusty maids.
Apollo rose up,
right? So we're going to play the song,
but I just want to give you a little run
through these lyrics. This is not a Christian
song. This is a pagan
song. And by the way, anyone who
knows esoteric
symbolism
knows when you combine
Venus with Bacchus, you get Lucifer.
Venus is Lucifer
and Bacchus is Liber.
So when you put them together
and you twine them into one,
you get Lucifer.
This is an ode to Lucifer.
Apollo is the Lightbringer, right?
So
now that we know
what was really going on in 1776,
what gods were really
being honored in this
religion we call
liberalism, whatever you want to call it,
freedom.
Let's play the clip on the bottom now.
Is it playing?
Can you guys hear that?
I can't hear anything.
I got a better way to play it.
I got a better way to play it.
I'm going to go to
I got it on another folder.
So I'll give you one second.
Alright.
Sorry about that.
Let me share my screen.
There we go.
To a napkin
in heaven
where he sat in fully
a few sons
of harmony
sent a petition
that
he, their inspirer
and patron, would be
when this answer
arrived
from the jolly
omission,
hoist fiddle
no longer be mute
while then
knew my name
and inspired you
to vote
and besides I'll instruct
you like me to
entwine
the Myrtle of Venus
with the
caresses vine
and besides I'll instruct
you like me to
entwine
the Myrtle of Venus
with the caresses vine
with the caresses vine
the sons
of an acryon
and joint
and in the hand
preserve you non-immigrant
friendship
and love
discourse to support
what so happily
planned
the sanction of gods
and the fiat
of joe
while thus we are
we, our toast
that we'd be
may our club flourish
happy, united
and free
and come make the sons
of an acryon
entwine
the Myrtle of Venus
with the caresses vine
and come
make the sons
of an acryon
entwine
the Myrtle of Venus
