to a place
you're going to see a radical shift
in how power is
used and what's
funny is all of those things
none of those constitutional
breaks matter
if you don't worship
justice the greeks
said when the gods
abandoned mortals
they said the last god
to leave was justice
and the reason she left
is because the courts
were getting paid
the courts were getting paid
we have anointed
someone who is above the law
and our presidency
think about this
our presidency from now on
and this is the decision of a court
that has taken more money
than any other
supreme court
right
what happened
what happened
justice
because of that money
with her she takes liberty
now people will say
oh god what are you talking about
I'm just talking history people
I'm just telling you what happened
cyclically through time
hail cleo is right
the muse of history
if we just watch what happens
you said trump is like
tyrant
yes that's the point
do you know who they went to
in democratic Greece
if we were in democratic Athens
excuse me if we were in democratic Athens
and we wanted to solve
the conundrum that America
is in the midst of
we'd send somebody
to the oracle
and sometimes the oracle
would send back a message that says
you've got to kill
the tyrants
you've got to kill tyrants
when George Washington
stepped aside
he wasn't going to be made one of these
tyrants because George Washington
drank from a pure stream
and I'm telling you
a pure classical stream
and the problem is
George Washington is right now
being remade
he's being remade do you know
they're saying oh yeah there's a famous place
where he kneeled down and prayed
that never happened
not historical
yeah so
I don't know tell me what you think about
there's this
there's this push to try to make
the founding fathers
into something like all the evidence
points to them being
not fans of Christianity at all
and going in the opposite direction
but there's still this shift to go
they kind of liked it
they kind of thought it was really cool
philosophical it's like no
the evidence does not suggest that
what it does say is that
they were in a serious time
they were going up against a king
who wants to
you know he wants to
it's king
king George
and so they have to do whatever they have to do
that means making alliances with
local churches of Puritans
they're going to do that
so you've got to realize there obviously
there's some politics going on
I thought your comment
I thought your comment
that you brought up the text
and you showed us
people were trying to enter Jesus Christ
in your constitution
and they were like no
this ain't happening right
you think the freedom of religious
expression which is so important
you think it's so important
for the wrong reason
it's important so that you and I
we can be pagans and the Christians
can say no you can't
right people think it's
it's a religious thing
it obviously is something the Christians put into it
no no no
it's the rest of us who were saying
saying look we've got to be protected
from any sort of one religion
it gets out of hand
right and this is
what you see with people who tried to defend
Christianity from people like Hitler
where Hitler is actually saying
he's a Catholic and he's
announcing to the people
he's putting that
that
what do you call it a stamp on himself saying
I am a Christian you don't get that
with Jefferson
with pain
with Washington
with Franklin they never even just
even just to be a politician
let's just say for this
for the sake of argument Hitler really wasn't a Christian
he was just doing it to be
as a politician sort of like what Trump does
fine
but the founding fathers weren't even willing to do that
they stuck
to the moral principle
and did not even pretend to be Christians
there wasn't even pretending going on
so even if you do
grant there's a pretending going on with Hitler
the fact that he's still pretending to do it
means he's using it
using it for his own
do you understand what I'm saying he's using it as a device
for that purpose
and that's what you find Christianity being used for
all the way from the time of
even from Constantine
to Theodosius
to Justinian all the way into Europe
it's always being used for this reason
yeah what's the difference there between
Trump and Constantine
right he's he's
he realizes the same thing that Trump did
oh I can embrace this
constituency they'll support me
and he only needed 30%
support and that's what he got with Christianity
and it locked him into power
so I don't know what's
any difference between
that sort of tyranny
and the tyranny that
we are up against now
and people are
I know people are going to sit there and go
what are you talking about what you know what I'm talking about
I'm talking about the classics
and I'm talking about stuff that Tom Jefferson as you
saw tonight was talking about
and if you study those
writings you can see
we're on the road
we're on the road to tyranny people say
oh no no no right
I said on John
on John Price's
show
from the very start I said
unless you shed that blood
to liberty you
you lose your liberty
the only reason they're saying that is because
they know this classical wellspring
and antiquity they worship
the muse Tom Thomas
Jefferson worships
the muse and
I don't know
let's say predictions what's going to
do you have any predictions for the immediate future
don't try to go beyond 2024
because 24 is going to be
right the big one
do you have any predictions what are you like
you've studied a lot of history
so what do you think
could be some possibilities here
what I'm seeing right now is sort of
reminds me of in Athens
at the end of the 5th century
yeah yeah end of the 5th century BC
when you have
the 30 tyrant thing happened right
but you also have at the same time
you had Euripides performing the Bacchai
and the Euripides performing the Bacchai
was so powerful
that it installed into the minds of the people
the ability
to produce
the mystery which is
liberty which is Bacchic freedom
which is joyous laughter
