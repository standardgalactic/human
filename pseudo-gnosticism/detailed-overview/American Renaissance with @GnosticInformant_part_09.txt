and all these beautiful paintings come out of France
and this is what I mean
by inspiration
it can be painters
it doesn't have to be a play
it doesn't have to be a movie
it can be paintings, it can be songs
but that's what is so important
to the spirit of humanity
is that you have
those outlets that are not
shut down with these cannons
canon laws
planting Bacchus
oh no no more of this, no no no more of that
and then that's what kills society
so it makes society dark
but the inspiration that can come from paintings
that can come from statues
sculptures
building styles
whether it be like Ionic columns
or Doric columns or whatever
architecture
everything goes back to inspiration
everything inspires
just walking through the countryside
and looking at the sunset
can be inspiration
so nature itself can inspire
and that's what I mean
Christianity does this thing where
it blocks you off from inspiration
and it siphons you off
into a dogmatic
worldview
that is completely fake
and it's completely antithetical to nature itself
I'll stand by this statement
for the rest of my life
the first thing that ever happened in humanity
okay so with that
I'll ask you the last question
with that in mind right
not blowing that off what you just said with that in mind
what's gonna happen
when they take over
to people like you
and me
they will make
so you're saying like these
far right Christian movements
get in power, what will happen
oh my speech
will be completely shut down
whatever
whatever outlets I have
to express my opinions will immediately be smothered
I'll be blocked on
all these social media platforms
and basically just be relegated
to the underground
in some fashion and who knows
it might even go as far as like
legal problems
and there might be some like blasphemy
laws against me something like that
alright if you can take
now wait a minute this isn't a world
people are saying no no we're not there
you're the Germans
who sat around and watched the Nazis
come to power and didn't do anything
this is how it works
people they just put the 10 commandments
these are the 10 commandments
in your classrooms
what about the future laws
that will outlaw things
that are in those commandments
like making images of God
what about that kind of thing
how far are we away from that
how far are we away from putting people
to death for a whole bunch of things
that typically
Americans don't put people to death
right come on man
right okay I understand
the really really bad people
who friggin deserve it
that I understand but dude
taking somebody because
her fetus was dead
and she was trying to get it extracted
she has to be dying too
before she can get extracted
we are back in 1331
and one of the next movements
is to take away
women's right to vote
when I heard that I thought
what a bunch of geniuses
they're serious
popular right-wing Christians
that are pushing for that
they even got women in those movements
pushing for that
I don't get it do you get it
that's what Christianity does to you
it puts you in that state
where that's all you can do
is serve this one God
there's a reason why in Exodus
are the 10 commandments
the first 10 of the 613 laws
that Moses gives
the first one
is you shall have no other gods
before Yahweh
there's a reason why that is
it cuts off all inspiration
from all other outlets
gods stand for something
they represent something
Daiki represents justice
Bacchus represents liberty
all these Venus represents sex
all these gods represent something
when you cut off all of those
and there's no other god but Yahweh
you cut off all inspiration
from all different powers
that can come into you
Yahweh doesn't want you to have liberty
Yahweh doesn't want you
any monist I don't care
if it's Aten
that Akhenaten worshiped
any monist god is going to cut off
all the other things
in the world
that you and I want to
worship things like love
things like love baby
love it okay
I was totally impressed
totally impressed with
your research tonight
and I want to thank you for coming
it's a big deal for us
to be able to be together
when they come for us Neil
I'm going to point to you and I'm going to be like
he made me do it
think about the
the vast difference
between what you get
from these canon laws
of these churches in the 7th and 8th
and 10th century going back to Constantine
himself
the vast difference you see in those canon
laws compared to what you see
in your constitution
and then tell me is the constitution
Judeo-Christian
are you kidding me
they're complete diametrically
opposites of each other
period
look what he did people
he's using magic on you
he made those people look into the mirror
and see themselves
and it's not constitutional
I want to say thank you for coming Neil
we'll drop things short now
I feel like I'm taking up too many people's time
thank you so much for coming Neil
I'm going to say Hail Satan
and I'll give you the last word
Hail Satan
the idea of poisonous kisses
that girl you know she's got it
Hail Satan
we'll do this all the way to the roads
we'll pave a ride a bare horse
from the sunshine
blue-toned big-time wolfman
hillside root cutter grow it
dawn bring her shining in the morning
they puff a little bit of the chronic
poisonous dragon venom
darkness through dreams
frankincide tails up on the hill
I make it rain I spit the hot fire
heels above the verses
make sure they got bunny ears on the gold horns
smoking in the purple
of the Sabbath
I'm Teddy Bass Mr. Black Magic
singing hallelujah
Jeepers creepers hot purple move ya
root cutter evergreen tree grower
the antichrist you dream of
thunder from unhigh
Venus in the sky heavy on the drums
ate a weight funk
bar kick mania
my dear dance with me
where the purple flowers grow
those with eyes to see
a kiss of Athena
dream of Saturn
Uranus Venus dress
roots crawl from the stars
overhead
off it comes to the moon
or a curitual
with a kiss and a whip
Lady Babylon is with you
Lady Babylon is with you
you
