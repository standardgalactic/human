I'll tell you what they're singing, they're singing the mystery rites, they're singing the same thing,
everybody else who's performing Bacchic ritual is singing, and here they go, here it goes,
what do you think, were you Christians, what did you think they were hemming, you think they had
one of your hymn books out there from 1850, how great the Lord, do you think that's what they're
singing, you freaking morons, oh my god, give it to me, give it to me, by the way, thank you to Teddy
Bass for the glorious music, Teddy is gonna take another modern and transform it into an ancient,
he's gonna do a miracle, he touched me right, Jesus touched me, give me the next one please,
please, and Jesus says everybody's gonna be scandalized, right, and why is this,
why is that one, that was the one that we had in twice, I meant to get rid of it, go,
that's the scondalone of the trap, right, everybody knows the scandal is the trap,
and Jesus says we're all gonna get trapped, right, and what is this, right, sticking a trap on which
the bait is placed, right, we're gonna get caught tonight, remember, I just wanted you to remember,
that's why I think that's why I repeated it, because I wanted you to hear the fact that Jesus
is setting this up, right, he knows dude, he knows, and what does this say, it says Jesus is saying
amen again, he's saying my name, say my name Jesus, I say you, right, in this night before the
crow, not crow, what's that guy called, rooster, rooster, before that rooster sounds,
right, you're going to deny that you know me three times, right, you're going to,
it's not just deny that you know, right, it's to say that you
thank that whatever is being discussed is bad, and you want nothing to do with it,
it's almost like you have to turn on some of, someone that you've been
following, and you're going to have to renounce, I like the word renounce better for that,
yeah, anyway, let's keep going, he says you're going to renounce me, here it is,
oh here it is, like, oh look, deny, right, to refuse, to reject, to deny, right, good, okay,
so something very serious is going to happen, and nobody ever points out that in the middle of this
entire party, in the garden, in the mouth of all of us, in the middle of all of this, there's some
there's some goings on that are, you don't realize you've interrupted a right,
right, the cops that came there suddenly interrupted Jesus, let's see what he does,
let's see what he does, I know I put it in there, right, and Jesus came to the place called guess
70, and he said to his 12 students, sit here, sit here, he's a nice place, isn't he creepy,
sit here, sit here, I'm going to go over there and pray, right, and everybody says these are 40
year old men, no they aren't, I'll show you there, so he's sitting down his class, and he's going to
go over there and pray, what does he do then, what does he do then, he takes a hold of Peter,
right, and the two sons of Zebedee, yeah, and he did what, what's he going to do,
he's going to take him with him at a distance, and he starts, he starts entering a pained
or grievous state, and he starts becoming confused, you mean Jesus the son of God was confused,
ademonain, ademonain, you're right, he was in a state of intoxication,
he was in a state of intoxication, a state of confusion, give me the next one,
give me the next one, ademonet, oh people look at it, to be sorely troubled just because nobody
ever believes me, to be in anguish, look down a couple of lines, to be puzzled, to be puzzled,
and where is this thing found, it's found in the epidemics, it's in the hippocratic corpus,
again we're looking at the term through its use, that is what classical philology is,
pointing at a translation on a computer screen and saying, reading off the translation,
what is that, that is so weak, you evangelicals, can I just say at this time,
you evangelicals are so disgracefully weak, why will none of you answer the call,
none of you out there, you know what, I feel like, I feel like Goliath, I feel like Goliath,
right, aren't there any Davids out there, because I'm getting tired of stepping on your asses,
I love it, Gnostic informants are going to bring some goodness too, did you send Gnostic
advice, sorry I sprung that on you Chewy, by the way, for anybody who puts down the Chewy,
anybody's Chewy, not just my Chewy, but Danny's Chewy, I saw those reviewers say something nasty
about Danny's, Danny Jones Chewy, who's Stephen with a BH, and that, that was unacceptable,
unacceptable, put them down, put them down for the demons, where the demons go, get them out,
I'll get them out, what is this saying, this is Hippocrates, or this is just an aside, look,
boop, we part back in time, back to fifth century, we're going to look at some fifth century type
medicine influenced by the Ionians, being practiced in Attica, oh yeah, what's this say, oh, these
things, right, these symptoms that he's been describing, because he goes through the year,
and he says this year, we had these diseases, and this year he says the symptoms were common in
Meira ki oisin, what are those, those are young girls, ne oisin, those are young boys,
and akamadzuisin, what do these people have in common, what does the neos have in common
with the Meiraks, they are akamadzuisi, isn't that a beautiful word, akamadzuisi,
they are blooming, blooming, okay, set that in your brain, and what does that bottom line say,
these are the types of people who spend time at the polystra and the gymnasium, what are they,
they're the schools, the public schools, do you know where Jesus gets his apostles
from public schools, that's why he calls his students children, again, it's the age between
10 to 12-ish and up to later teens, right, and by the way, people say St. Peter was married,
no, no, no, he wasn't, he wasn't right, it's one word for sister-in-law, right, and mother-in-law,
it's the same word, he's probably his brother's wife, yeah, this is hate, because why, how can I
be so sure, because there's no other evidence of a freaking wife anywhere, right, and it doesn't fit,
that he's married at such a young age, fantastic, by the way, the tax collector was sitting at the
booth, he wasn't employed, okay, give me the next one, what is a mathay taste, I want you to look
into the face of the apostle tonight, right, right, it's the people, people of philosophers and
rhetoricians, right, students of, you know, apprentices, people studying medicine, right,
this is the teen year, right, the teen experience, and I'm not saying year by year by year,
the growth experience is that period, growth and following, the bloom and following,
when what are these people doing, they're usually working with someone specifically
to learn, it's a form of education or paideia, okay, remember, nobody's been speaking Hebrew
here for hundreds of years, right, we've all been speaking Greek, and we had that revolution,
right, we want those libraries, we want those texts, yay civilization, love it, give me the next one,
look at what do we do in the Gymnasium, we do bodily exercises, right,
gymnastics school, in Egypt, those who have received training is the Phoebes, and everybody
knows what a Phoebes are, a Phoebes are teenagers, why, they are in the bloom of youth, they didn't
look at it like 16, 17, 18, they didn't look at it like that, they looked at it as blooming,
I told you, I told you, an overwhelming majority of these people are involved in one way or another
with agriculture, okay, fantastic, we cannot forget that, a Phoebe, we're talking about a Phoebes,
do you understand, Christians, do you understand when it's translated as disciples, do you understand,
we're talking about students, Jesus is doing everything he's doing as a Christos
with the appropriate 12 children, appropriate for the rites, right, Paul does the same thing,
he has to go out and get 12 too, why is it, why do you think it is, haven't you been in a synagogue,
haven't you been in a synagogue by the second century, the synagogue has an ion, has an ion with
the ribbon of the astrology around it, 12 houses, don't you know what you're doing, you need one
kid for every house, okay, all right, stuff has to be followed, there's prescriptions for this,
these drugs are crazy, crazy complicated and dangerous, the whole process of putting yourself
into death and being raised again into new life, that entire mystery is a very, very regulated
process, okay, otherwise you can end up dead, bro, you can end up dead and Jesus is like
handing out the poison, right, everybody knows that Jesus Christ, if you don't know, go look at Mark
chapter 16, Jesus Christ is handing out the death poison to people, right, everybody knows that,
did anybody say that to any of the evangelicals that tried to poison their minds, did you tell
them that, what about Jesus handing out death drugs, huh, Jim Jones did, everybody made a big deal
out of that, what about Jesus, because Jesus's drugs bring you back baby, they bring you back,
you know you can, you know they have the technology, let me just say this, for the conspiracy people
out there, I want to tell you one thing about Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ hung on a cross
and died before he was supposed to, the only injury he was given beside the beating
was the sword in the side, the javelin in the side and what happened, what happened with that
wound, well that's what killed him, no he had already been dead but and here's what you'll love,
those wounds can be easily closed, Galen talks about suturing and stuff up all the time,
their military physicians are great at it, okay you guys know that, give me the next one,
we need more evidence here, I want to see the zombies, bring in the zombies, bring in the zombies,
what happens to this, Jesus is in a place of pain, he says look my mind, ah we're in the garden and
Jesus is like, ah my mind is so burdened, it's burdened all the way into death, right he's going
into it, he's going into it, this is what's going on and his drugged students are sleeping,
the only one who's not sleeping is that naked kid that's with Jesus, because all of this is happening
around that naked kid, okay what does he say, what does he say, he says I'm going into that death,
my, my, see you kid, my soul is so heavy, I'm going to that death and what, what, may not
hold it, right, he's talking to him, standing over him, sons of bitches, what's he doing,
he's standing over those apostles and they've fallen asleep again, he says you couldn't,
you couldn't stay here, right, may not stay, stay here, he's giving him a command, right,
remain vigilant and do what, Gregoreo with me, yeah, be aware, right, be aware, be on guard,
Jesus needed the three that were the most impressive physical
you know,
sub examples, he needed them to be there, to be watching, and he tells them
watch but don't be tempted, this is all in the environment of him praying to God,
please, if I don't have to do this, don't let me, right, we'll just, we'll just not do it,
it's hard to do the pasco man, what do you think he's trying to, what do you think this is easy,
give me the next one, give me the next one, oh God, what's this was Matthew 26 39, yeah,
so he goes away a little bit, he falls on the, on his face and he's praying, he's saying, oh God,
if it's possible, you know, put this thing aside, this cop, put this cop aside, he's with the kid,
remember, he's with the kid, he and the kid, Peter, James and John at a distance who keep
falling asleep, and what's he say, right, what's he say, oh, um, if it's your, you know, we'll let
it be done, but if not, you know, right, I want what you want, big daddy, and what happens comes
to a students and he finds them there and they're totally passed out, he says, you idiots, you couldn't
even keep it together to help me keep watch of what was going on, because remember, he's been
talking about, we're going to, we're going to get given up, baby, right, so stay awake,
pay attention and do what, don't get tempted, why, because the spirit is willing,
it's strong, it's profumon, it has that flumos, that's the spirit, but the sarx,
oh, the sarx is weak, the flash is weak, don't be tempted, what he's doing with the boy,
don't be tempted, the flash is weak, do you remember what Paul said, he's got that what,
in his flesh, he's got that venom in his flesh, he's got that thorn,
okay, remember the sex drugs, they're using the sex drugs in this process and if you ever
haven't been, look, what is that sex drug doing, it's forcing orgasm, right, forced psychotic
orgasm, confused paranoid orgasm, Jesus is rolling on the ground, I'm about to show you what he says,
when he stands up and starts talking, it makes no frigging sense, makes no sense,
give me the next one, this dude, they say I'm crazy, oh my god, look at Jesus, right, what's he doing,
if I was caught with 12 students out in the public park, I wouldn't be standing here in my
kitchen of doom, talking to you, that's for sure, what's he, he comes back and he finds
them sleeping again, darn it, they're anesthetized, what, and he says, look, he's waking them up in
their eyes, or they can't open their eyes, right, seriously, I wake up, if I think a spider is
crawling across my face, that wakes me up, boom, I'm like a century, seriously, you're out in a
public park and you can't even hold your eyes open, what was in the cup, Jesus, what was in the cup,
and why are you telling these young kids, why are you telling these young people, these bloomers,
why are you telling them to not be tempted, tempted what, tempted with what, you freak,
all right, bring on, we got to bring zombies, we got to bring zombies, I told you, I told you,
Neil, I was going along tonight, and he comes to his students and he says, then wake the hell up,
right, now it's time, are you ready, the Christians are gonna, right, they're gonna love this,
now it's time, he says, the hour has come, right, for the Son of Man to be handed over to the hands
of those who were doing wrong, give it to me, he knows the jig is up, when I watch, this gives him
away, the evangelicals are gonna love this, this gives him away, he says, what does Jesus say, now,
if you're right, and he is ha, and the Son of God is standing there, right, he is ha, and he knows
everything, all praise, right, to the Lamb of Pascha, he knows everything, why does he say this,
get up, let's get out of here, there's the, there's the one who betrayed me,
why does he say let's get out of here, why does he say that,
Jesus, you know you're about to get crucified, why are you telling the boys, hey, the jig is up,
let's get out of here, argoman, with that one word, argoman, Christian theology takes a dive,
Jesus Christ was trying to get away, he wasn't able to, I surprised him, it was too much,
and those idiot kids were all anesthetized, have you, what happened to the other ones,
I don't know, but they just run, as soon as this cop show up, what happens, you're at that party,
you know what I'm talking about, you're at that party, stuff's been happening, and you know,
you go into rooms, and there's, you know, people are frigging crazy, right, and what happens when
the sirens show up, woo, right, it was a group of Roman soldiers, it was a SWAT team, when a SWAT
team shows up, in this circumstance, everybody ran, Jesus was right, he got scandalized, and here it
is, let's go, nope, Jesus, sorry, you're not on mission, you're not on mission, you are about to
get treated in the fashion that all lace ties, you darn well know, get treated, you're about to get
crucified, how do you think Jesus knew that he was gonna get crucified, you know what gets you
crucified, not being a thief, right, thieves don't get crucified, are you kidding me, yeah,
people are trying to take shit in the marketplace all the time, you can't crucify all those people,
what do you do, what do you do, you crucify only those who need to be visibly seen to be crucified,
it's public execution, it's very civilizing, when you show the worst of the worst being killed,
you got your eyes wide open, thank you Ludovico, thank you, oh god, I love the serum,
here's to the Ludovico, give me the next one, let's go, okay, I'm gonna love it, oh god, yeah,
take it away, now what are the words that Jesus says, right, now listen, from Jesus' mouth,
how doped up he is, because a couple of them start to fight back, right, Peter starts to fight back,
and Jesus says, what are you doing, don't you know that I can call daddy and he can send me,
how many, how many legions of angels, oh my god, what, what are you talking about, these are people
in history, it's a SWAT unit, and they're here to arrest you, and they're not gonna arrest you
just for anything Jesus, they're gonna arrest you for a crucifiable crime, and you're talking about
what, dude, dude seriously, legions of angels, seriously, do you hear the kids screaming in
the background running away, and right now the naked kid with the bandage on his hoo-ha,
he's nervous because now he bolts, they go for him and he bolts, what was that kid doing with
Jesus in that park, he was doing something that could get Jesus Christ crucified, was Jesus Christ
justifiably crucified, yeah, just like the two dudes next to him, just like the two dudes next to
him, give it to me, give it though, there he is, crucified Jesus, here let's do some gratuitous
history, here he is, but before, what does he get before, imagine him getting this before,
try that sometime, try that sometime, you know the same group gets executed and imprisoned
right by other prisoners, that innate justice that says you cannot harm children, that's universal,
that doesn't go away, you can't wipe that out, you can't wipe that out, the drive to crucify Jesus
Christ was a drive to stop those involved in the trade, we have trafficking right now,
where people are drugged and put into sexual situations and dominated by the drugs, manipulated
by the drugs, do you think this is a new invention, the Romans wanted to put a stop to it, this Christian
guy said, oh it was, gee it was the Christians, they're the ones who stopped all the pederasty,
they're the, no they aren't, they are not the ones who stopped the pederasty, and I can give you
example after example after example of Christians being put into jail for sexually abusing children,
okay, in what, in rights, Christian rights, all right, so yeah, I'm sorry for the Christians
out there, I'm sorry, I'm very sorry that you know the reality has to be this way, but we have to
be true to those texts right, we have to follow those texts, give me the next one, let's hurry,
let's get through this right, so that Neil can come out, oh god here, no let's keep going,
we did that one, here go to the next one, go to the next one, get up, let's go, yeah, yeah,
