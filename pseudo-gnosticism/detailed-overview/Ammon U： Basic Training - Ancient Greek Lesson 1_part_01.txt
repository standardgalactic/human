Oh god
Waiting till the drill instructor gets here
I'm going to love this
Go give me the next one
I want you to remember people
Pharmacon
We just talked about the pharmacomancy
What is the
You didn't realize that the religion
Was being generated by pharmacomancy
Oh my god
Montea through farmaca
Watch what is going
This is
I'm telling you what is in the air
And what these people are breathing
They are fumigating
I'm not going to do this the whole night
I just want you to see
Look at the second paragraph
In purple
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 lines down
In christo
You're going to see christo in there
You're going to see all sorts of christing
We are never going to be far
From the christing
Why would you bring it up now
We're going to go fast
This intro is fast
Here's your mantis people
Notice that it's the seer
Look at all the different seers
Apollo and Cassandra
Look at the second line
Seibula
The symbols that are painted
In the chapel
Oh god
Do you know where they come from
They come from here
They come from time
When people were saying
Who and what
Are the seer
And it turns out
The power is in the language
That they called the logos
In the beginning was
The logos
Mystery
It's all over
The greek language
The ancient greek
And what you're going to be lucky
To be able to do
Is to draw from wells
That have not been accessed
Oh god
This is all frontier
It's gorgeous
Absolutely gorgeous
You're going to love it
I'm slowing things down
Look at this people
I just want to see that
In christ station
He's there
Bring him back
What is somebody who's
Pharmacost
That's knowing many drugs
And in the greek
The next word is
Who are the eaitroi
Those are those who
Those are the healers
Right
And we have healers
As women earlier than any other
Profession
Looks like
They got all the brains early on
Somebody told me that
Somebody told me that recently
Your Y chromosome is malfunctioning
Right
Something happened
What is this
Pharmacost
I wanted to introduce you to greek
Before I give you the drill sergeant
Because I want you to see
The greeks have a word for somebody
Who knows a lot about drugs
In an intimate kind of way
Given
To the use of drugs
Look who's the author there
Gailin
That's gailin
That's a medical text
Do you know
When the head of my committee told me
The romans
With reference to recreational drugs
The romans just wouldn't do such a thing
It was text like this that I thought
Have you never read
Have you not cracked
These works open
Oh my god
I'm sorry
All going
Look at number three
Of countries
Abounding and healing or poisonous herbs
And what country is that
Turenia
Do you know who those people are
They're what we call the Etruscans
What are the Etruscans known for
And you're not going to see this
You go all the way to Italy today
You can get in a taxi
And cross your fingers
And hold on
And you can get to that Etruscan site
Right from Rome
You're there
And at that Etruscan site
You will never know
That the people who were there
Were known for all their drugs
Were known for their drugs
Do you know how many words in Greek there are
For altered mental state
My god
My god
The Etruscans
It makes sense because the Etruscans
Were buddies
With the Pulascians
Yeah
So it only makes sense
We know those Pulascians everywhere they go
They're spreading the drug cult
The earliest one
Is on Samothrace
Right
We talked about it
You and I are tracking the cults baby
We're going
This is not nobody's brain
Do you know why
Because nobody works with these tags
And
What I find so beautiful is
You are going to give me an opportunity
To
Give you
Access
To those same texts
So that you can have your eyes
Opened
So that you can see what it was
The Etruscans are there
You may walk into one of their tombs
And see all the goofy stuff
And say oh god these people were high
You may do that
But you won't know
How accurate you actually are
Oh god
There's so much
Let's go give me the next one
I love this
Look at this
Did we get diamond
We're supposed to get diamond first
Oh I missed the order up here
Boom and the next one
Boom and the next one
Just go on the next one
Oh god, next one
Look at that, here we go
No, not here
Oh my god
Look this sergeant's going to be so mad
Boom, okay
Well here's the definition of diamond
What
The LSJ will provide you
And Henry Little
Right as a little Scott
Oxford Lexicon
He was the father, please everybody know this
He was the father of Alice in Wonderland
Yeah
The Alice from Alice in Wonderland
Her father
Was working on putting
Together what I'm flashing up
In front of you
And his student
John Johnson
And Chuck changed his name
To Lewis Carroll
Oh wait a minute
Were there dragons in those days
I think there were dragons
Here we go
What does this word diamond mean
It's a power or a capacity
Demon, it's our word for demon
Somebody asked me what is a god
