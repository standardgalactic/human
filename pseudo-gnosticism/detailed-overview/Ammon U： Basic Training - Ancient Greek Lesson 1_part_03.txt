And it's a privilege
And an honor to teach you
Greek
You'll come in here
With certain preconceived notions
You will think that you know
Certain things
Everybody comes in here
With an attitude
An attitude
Leave your arrogance
At the door
Leave your brain
At the door
I don't need your thoughts
And you don't need your thoughts
You're not going to thank your way
Through push ups and pull ups
You're just going to do
If you want to master
The language
The rest of you can sit
You're allowed to
Sit and watch
There's things I'd like to say
That you're allowed to do
This is very serious
You are a slave
And this
Training
The Bacchic reality
Is liberty
Celebrity
Oh God
Oh God
Now if you want to get there
You're going to have to listen to me
You're going to have to do exactly what I say
There are influences here
That you will not understand
You and I fight
Against principalities
And powers
That's a good thing
There are high places
No
We're in a struggle
We will soon
Lose
Our liberty
There are people
Who want to stop
Just something as
Simple as this class
There are people who want to stop that
I was notified today
There are people who want to stop it
Why would you want to stop it?
Because we are in the vanguard
I can tell you
This information
It will bring you to a place of honor
Now
If you want to be
Where Sappho was
If you want to be
Where Lord Byron was
Maybe where Thomas Jefferson was
If you want
To inhabit the same cosmos
That they did
This is the tool
This is the tool
And you're going to have to listen
To what I say
It is my job
To get you through the obstacle course
It is my job
To get you to a point
Where you can use the skill
For yourself
It will take 24 sessions
Now
You can take them at your pace
But if you're going to go from one
To two
You better be ready
You better do what I say
Your very first instructions
Will be the most basic
Rule number one
Don't think
Don't think you can't
English speaking
French speaking
Italian speaking
Spanish speaking
Polish speaking
Brains
Russian speaking
Arabic
Hebrew
Modern
Throw them all in there
Because they will never
Even Chinese
Chinese
100,000
Unique words
100,000
Ancient Greek eats that for lunch
Somewhere between
500,000 and 1.5 million
It's off the chart
So this is what I can bring
To you
Take your brain and shut it off
Because it's functioning in a world
Of 100,000 words
The big deal is
You
Will be able to
Create
Logos
You
And there's the magic
But you're not going to get to that place
Unless we listen
To each other
And I have to be really strict
I'm going to show you exactly what
To do
Are you ready?
Hit me with them all
You're going to
Over the next week
You're going to get real familiar with something
You're going to get real familiar
With letters
There's 24 plus 1
Invisible 1 I want you to learn
And I know you've never used
An invisible letter
Did you know you could use invisible letters
With your words?
It explains a lot
It explains why Saturn
Is satan
Yeah, neat
This is alpha
What I want you to do is get in bed with the curves
Get in bed
Learn it
Alpha first letter
Second letter
Beta
Look at those
Look at the curvaceous forms on that beta
Whatever it takes for you to memorize this
Alphabet I want you to do it
And guess what pronunciation we're using
Guess what pronunciation we're using
We're using that
Which I was taught in the United States
West of the Mississippi River
In the 20th
That's what we're using
We're not going to use the original
Because the original Greek
Was accented
Via tone
Right? Oh god
Had a pitch accent to it
And what are you going to do? We don't have that
Address accent speakers
We are marching in a single line
The Greeks are not
Let me blow your brain
Are you ready for this?
Verbs
Have one type of accent
Nouns have another
Yeah
Nouns
Attempt to retain
Where their accent is
When the end of the word changes
They attempt to keep the same spot
Verbs, they don't care
They adjust
They're the machines of the language
That adjust
And you're going to start using them that way
I thought I just over my mouth
Had just stuff run out
Yes, you do
Because you're raised under the slavery of English
People are always asking me
How is it in ancient Greek
You can read six lines
And not get to the main verb
Until the end
In other words, you can't solve
What's going on
Until you've seen the end
Right?
Think about this for a minute
Ancient Greek
I'm not talking modern Greek
That stuff they found in northern Turkey
That's a descendant
A close descendant of
Koine Greek
Hellenistic Greek
Modern Greek is
It's not related to modern Greek
