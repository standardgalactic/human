Your conception of a dimon
Is completely off
Completely
Interesting

Yeah
Those fallen messengers
Are always the ones to bring you the facts
Those fallen messengers
So how do we translate this?
People think about that
Am I going to wake up in the morning and demonize?
That's how we're going to have to translate that
With a word, demon
Taken from that word
This is going to bring us perfectly right
Keep going
That's any kind of writing
Look at the gamma up front
Gamma
Up

When you're thinking about what a book is
Yeah, it's just there in different forms
They got parchment, they got animal skin
All that kind of stuff

What's going to happen?
He's going to strike Patakso
What am I going to strike him?
I'm going to strike him in
Ecstasy
Now here for those of you
Who are trying to follow
You're not supposed to be able to at this point
I'm just exposing you
Does it feel good?
Now look at verse number four
Look at the second line
It's one, two, three, four, five words in
That's
Alpha, Sigma, Tao
Alpha, Sigma, Epsilon, Yoda
Don't say Iota
If you say Iota
I don't know what's going to happen
I'm going to lose it
Don't say Iota
I'd say Iota as well
E plus Yoda
I'll take that too
Just don't say Iota
What am I going to do?
I'm the all ruling
Lord, what am I going to strike every horse
In ecstasy
You hear ecstasy
In English because
It's where we stole the concept of ecstasy
From him. He's going to strike the horse
He's going to place the horse
In ecstasy
And what else is he going to do?
Ton anabatin autu
In parafronese
He's going to put
The rider of that horse in a state
Of parafronesis
What is parafronesis?
Give me that definition
Watch this people, the technicality
Boom, this is the word
First word I want you to think about
Ecstasy
Ecstasy
Give me the next one
Parafronese
Again, the date of
What are
And I'll tell you later what those mean
That's how the ending of the word is changing
Don't worry for now. All I want you to see
This thing starts with a P
And I'm not going to say pie. It's a P
Watch this people
What is ecstasy? Give me the definition
Oh my god
Displacement
Greek, ancient Greek
Displacement
A standing
Away or outside
Of what is normal
Number two, distraction
Of mind
Distraction of
Mind plus a little bit
Of intransmit
Intransmit
Okay
Do you understand what ecstasis
Is?
Ecstasis and some preacher
Will stand up and say this is from
The prefix ec and history
Me
Yeah, shut up
Watch how the word transforms
Give me the next one. That's ecstasis
Now what is the Hebrew?
Because this is translated
Into Hebrew
What does the Hebrew give us
For ecstasis?
It gives us this
Dhamma
To be astounded
Or dumbfounded
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
Ecstasis
Is not this
Because there is a great concept
For this it's Dhammadzo
And if you believe
The BS
Story that's been handed down to us
That this was originally Hebrew
And then translated into Greek
The Greek translator just missed
Something
Extremely obvious
Extremely, either the Greek translator
Is terrible, or the original
Greek was rendered into a much
More simplistic Hebrew
Form that couldn't
Carry the technical capacity
In other words, ancient Hebrew
Got no word for ecstasy
Sorry
To be astounded
Or dumbfounded
Now give me the other ones
What is paraphernesis?
What is paraphernesis?
Let me see the definition first
Whoops, no, that's not
Paraphron
Paraphron
Right?
Look in the parentheses, you see
The main is that mind, right?
What is that wandering
From reason?
Paraphron is to be
Beside your reason, to be standing beside
Like if you could take your reason out
Of your body and
Stand there
That's what you're entering into
When you are paraphrenetic
Now look at that, I just made an English word
That doesn't exist
Paraphrenetic
To stand outside
