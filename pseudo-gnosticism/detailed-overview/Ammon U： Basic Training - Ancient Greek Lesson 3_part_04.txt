This is the non-Hellenistic concept
When you're taking the filter
And you're shaking out the rocks
All the dust is falling down there on the bottom
And all you've got left are these bigger rocks on the top
This is what you shake out
Okay, now check out the bottom of this
This is the concept in Hebrew
Of genocide
Look at the bottom comment
Pull up the bottom, pull up the bottom comment
Again, this is ancient
The stuff that we think was at a certain time
But we don't have any of it surviving
So let's see what, here we go
People read this, what is this thing?
Thing hostile to theocracy
And therefore to be either destroyed
Or in the case of certain objects
I.e. or A.G., silver and gold
Vessels of brass and iron
No reason to destroy that
So set apart to sacred uses
That's what we need to do
This is part of a word
This is part of a word
It's an expression of human action
It's an expression of human action
The language carries this action
And it carries it via the speaker's beliefs
Did you see tonight?
All the beliefs, we believe it was here
We believe it was here
It's proposed that it's here
It's proposed that it's there
We don't have any that survives
What do we have that survives?
We have a shit ton of Greek
Let's see
Let's go ahead and leave that up for a minute
But give me, you know what?
I'm gonna go grab the sergeant
And what I want you to do is sing
Happy Birthday to Jova one more time
Yahoo, yahoo, when's your birthday?
Everybody
Happy Birthday to Yahoo
Happy Birthday to Yahoo
Happy Birthday, Elohim Hashim Jova
It was in the third century
Fantastic
I'm glad you got that introduction
Now, shut up and listen to me
I've been watching your comments
I know what you're doing
And I admire the fact that there are those of you
Who are taking initiative
Doing what you need to do to get done
I'm gonna show you tonight
As we finish unit one
I'm going to show you tonight
Where you should be
What you should be doing
All you have to do is listen to me
I know people are writing and saying
You know what?
I got a terrible grade
When I was in high school Latin
That's because your Latin teacher sucked
Yeah, that's why
Your Latin teacher was not
A true representative of the guild
Fantastic
If they drove you away
They probably drove everyone away
Yeah, yeah
I'm here to give you the dope
To keep you moving
You have got to run these obstacle courses
What are we doing in unit one?
We are getting you to start thinking
In Greek letters
To start thinking in Greek letters
That's all we're doing
We're showing you what is a verb, a noun
And an adjective
Basic words
Basic words
Don't worry, those are all things
We're gonna give them to you
The ones that you need to know
Will give them to you
Don't worry
What am I gonna do tonight?
I'm gonna take you on that obstacle course
I want you to run it with me
Okay, there are those of you who know
You can make it through the year
And there are those of you who are afraid
I will make you succeed
I will make you succeed
So shut up and listen to me
Chewie, give me the first slide tonight
Boom
We're gonna do some words together, people
I'm gonna spell this for you
This first one
Let's just spell this together
Alpha, gamma, omicron, row, alpha
Oh, isn't that nice?
Now, what have I got here?
I'm gonna tell you this once
You will never make a mistake again
This is a noun
Do you know how I knew that so quickly?
Because look at the tail end of the entry
It's got an eta there
With a rough breathing over it
Hey, that's a definite article
Nouns, get, definite articles
What is a definite article?
It's our word, the, the
It's a little bit more sophisticated
Than our the and on
Right?
It's a little more sophisticated
You'll get to enjoy the definite article
But that's how I know it's a noun
This is a noun
What is an agorah?
Agorah
That first word that you see
That's the nominative case
Remember, I told you to memorize
Nominative, genitive, dative, accusative
Those four cases, always in that order
Nominative, genitive, dative, accusative
What is this?
The first one is the nominative
The second one is the genitive
Agoras
Agoras
Good
Notice over the alpha, please
Is a smooth breathing
It looks like an apostrophe
You're not going to call that an apostrophe
You're going to call it a smooth breathing
In our new language that will open your brain
It's a smooth breathing
What is a smooth breathing?
Has no H sound
Rough breathing
The other way, open parentheses
That has an H sound accompanying with this
This is smooth breathing
No H sound
Good, agorah, agoras, hey
What is that?
It's a marketplace
It's a place for you to go and exchange
And to interact
Oh, God, and people say it's like a grocery store
No, it's not
You can go see doctors
You can do all sorts of stuff
You can meet there
I'll meet you in the marketplace
Oh, let's get some fruit
Give me the next one
Watch this, people
I want you to spell these words out
This is your vocabulary
Look at it and say
Alpha, delta, epsilon, lambda, phi, omicron, sigma
I'm going to do it again
Alpha, delta, epsilon, lambda, phi, omicron, sigma
Look at that sigma on the end
That's the terminal, sigma
It's the one that looks like the snake
Otherwise, it's an omicron
With a little tail on the top part of it
Looking to the east
Fantastic
What's its genitive form?
Adelfu
Now, what's going on?
Look at that
Those last two vowels are omicron, epsilon
And those two vowels are what you call a diphthong
People have said, I saw you
I saw you writing about it
What's a diphthong?
What's a diphthong?
It's just two vowels stuck together
And it comes together to make a different sound
Omicron, ah, epsilon, ooh
What happens when you bring ah-ooh together?
You get ooh
Here, a little bit of that diagrama
A little bit of that diagrama
Stuck in that epsilon, wah
That's the wah sound, ooh
Nice, nice
And its definite article is ho
Now, that looks different from hey
Yes, because hey is feminine
Ho is masculine
Toh is neuter
Ho, hey, toh
All words for the
That's called the definite article
And you will know a noun's gender
Because of its definite article
Oh, god
Now, are there exceptions to that?
Of course, there are sometimes
Sometimes things are not so obvious
99.9999% of the time
I want you to hold this notion
The definite article shows you the gender
Of the noun
You want to see the gender of the noun?
Come here now
Come here now
Let me see that gender
