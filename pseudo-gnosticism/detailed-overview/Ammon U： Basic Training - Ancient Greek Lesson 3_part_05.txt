Let me see it
Ooh, this one is neuter
How do you tell that?
You tell it from the definite article
That's what that tail is giving you there
Pay attention to it
Give me the next one
Boom
Boom
Anthropos
Anthropo
Ho
You know
This thing has got a masculine definite article on it
What is an anthropos?
It's a person
Don't say man
I know your book translates it that way
It's not
It's a general person
The anthropology is the
Studying the people
Yes, gorgeous
One thing I want you to notice
What this word is doing
Now there's something going on here
That you can't hear
There's something going on
And I love your frightened little minds
I love them
I love them
Oh, God
It's like
Okay, let's not go there
Anthropos
Look where the accent is
It's over alpha
Don't be afraid, people
For those of you who are not afraid
Something's wrong with you
You should be
But for those of you who are afraid
Everybody
Everybody
Don't worry
The drill sergeant is yelling at everyone
Just follow my instructions
Look at the accent on this thing
It's over the alpha
But what happens on the genitive?
The accent jumps to the omega
It goes from anthropos
To anthropo
And why do we do that?
Because the ending of the word has a diphthong
Diphthongs are long
They're long
And what happens?
What do you mean long?
Extra time
For you, it's extra time
And when you put that much time into something
It's going to drag that accent toward it
It's like gravity
This is all musical
It's all musical, right?
Greek
Now, there's a lot of classical scholars out there
And you can walk up to one
You know, get their attention
Slap them
You know, shake them
Hey, classical philologists
Tell me something
Right, tell me something
Was ancient Greek musical?
And they'll have to say yes
Unfortunately, we're not going to be able to
Plumb the depths
Of that musicality
This is something you'll develop
You'll develop a little bit of appreciation
But to the level that the Greeks had it going
It's the reason they could say
There's two types of people
And there were those who speak Greek
And those who don't
Right?
The division of the Jew
And the Gentile in the Septuagint
Is a reflection of this very idea
You say, I thought the ungodly, Hellenistic Greek
I thought it was, you know, something came later
No, no, no
Do you see why you have to fabricate history
By assuming the language
There was a language back then
It was called ancient Hebrew
Do you see why you have to fabricate that history
If you're a theologian or a monist
Because the authority is in the language
And if you don't have a language
You don't have authority
Yeah, you know
It's an attempt
It's an attempt to adapt
Good
Let's go to the next one
Give me another word, Chewie
Give me another word
Boom
Watch this, Biblion Bibliu
Look, read these
Read these, look at that accent, Biblion
I just want you to attempt the accent now
Beta Eota Beta Lambda Eota Omicron New
Spells Biblion
And what is Biblion?
You're going to say book
No, it's a scroll
That's okay
That's okay
If you want to translate this book
I'll give you that one
Notice that this one is neuter
Neuter
Look at the top on the end of it
That means it's neuter
Neuter, okay, look
None of this are you learning
Because you're a smarty
This is just physics
This is elements that we're dealing with
That's it
It's just physics
There's no reasoning that you're going to be needing
Put away your calculators
People are shocked when I say that
But when they come into Greek, I tell them
You're going to have a problem
Because your brain thinks it's intelligent
Right?
You know, so does mine
I suffer from the same humanity
The Greek will teach you that you are not
Was that somebody at the...
At the port?
Hang on
Give me a second
Give me a second
I told you to clamp down those doors, right?
They're going to...
Stormtroopers are going to keep doing that
Chewie, we got to watch that
Give me the next one
Now, what do you know right away about it?
You saw the ta
You know, this is a neuter
Fantastic, it's a neuter noun
What does this one mean?
Doron
A doron is a gift
A doron is a gift
Give me the next one
We're going to fly through these
And then I want to give you a couple of reviews
People, here's another type of word
Let's just appreciate this little type of word
It's called a preposition
Preposition
It's preposition
Yeah, it's going to come before a noun
And it's going to tell you
I can either go into this noun
I can come out of this noun
Or I can be in this noun
Ace into
X or X out of
And in
Prepositions are just
Positional words
Under
Over
Within
Right
Yes, prepositions
Prepositions, they're going to come before
The noun
Excellent
That they govern
Go ahead
Give me the next one
Gorgeous
Look at this gorgeous
Ergon ergo
What is that?
It's a work
What do you talk about
When you mention ergonomics
Ergon means a work
A work
All right, now some of these concepts
That I'm giving you
As soon as they're like seeds
And we put them in your brain
And they blow up
As soon as you start seeing
This thing used
Oh, God, you're going to start getting excited
And things are going to happen
You're going to have certain feelings
Certain chemistry is going to be going on
And it makes me want to say
Stop
And watch
What's happening to yourself
The Greeks
During the first century
To the about second
Anodomony
First BC
They're very fond of this concept
Think about this
Think about this intellectually
The contrast
Between logos
