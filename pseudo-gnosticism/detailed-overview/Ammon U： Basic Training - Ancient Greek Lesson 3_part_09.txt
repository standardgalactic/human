With books
Good, that's a double-accusative on the end
Ton of adelfon and tentechnique
Double-accusative
Now we sound like nerds, right?
Now we sound like nerds
What do you need to take home?
Nominative, subject, genitive, possession
Dative, to, for, or with
Accusative
Object of the verb
That's what the verb's acting on
Gorgeous
Give me the next one
I'm just gonna fly
Because I'm taking away too much
Of these professionals' time
And I respect you guys too much
This chart you must memorize
Is from Unit 1
You must memorize these endings
Notice on the left, nominative, genitive
Dative and accusative, right?
I want you to memorize
People are always telling me
I can't get all these things right in my head
I can't get all these forms right in my head
Then stop
If it's not working, then stop
Something's wrong
Abandon that approach, right?
Don't try to get these things straight
Build the muscle
A-A-E-A-N
I own ice, us
What are those plurals?
I own ice, us
What are those plurals?
In the feminine, first declension
In Greek, I own ice, us
I have that cell programmed in my head
And reinforced from the last 35 years
That I will wake up still
Chanting paradigms
I own ice, us
Do you know why people make fun
Of those Brits for their schooling?
Their young boys and girls in their classes
Chanting off the Greek endings
You know what they were doing?
They recognized they were building
Machines of classical civilization
That's what you're doing
You're doing it with a language
You're doing it with a language, isn't that fantastic?
I am going to capacitate you
Do you know what my job is?
It's to capacitate you
I'm going to take your brain
And I'm going to capacitate it
In and out
Get that chart memorized, people
Next one
Trust me, trust me
These things will help
Sit on the toilet if you have to
I own ice, us
Let's go to the second declension
Here's the chart
You've got to memorize for the second declension
Ignore that vocative at the bottom
Ignore that
I just want you to see the
Nominative, genitive, dative, and accusative
Logos, logu, right?
What are the endings?
Osu, oy, on
What are they in the plural?
Oy, on, oy, sus
Oy, on, oy, sus
What are they in the feminine?
I, on, ice, us
What are they in the masculine?
Oy, on, oy, sus
Oy, on, oy, sus
Make it native
Make it native
How do you do that?
You listen to Cicero
Cicero, c'mere Cicero
Pull up your toga
What did Cicero tell us
That nobody ever listens to?
Repetitio est mater schientiae
What did you say there in your Latin?
Cicero
Repetition is the mother of learning
Repetition, repetition, repetition
These are reps
What do you think?
Do you go to the gym?
What do you think?
Do you stand there and you're like, oh, I'm not, I can't do this.
I can't look, it's heavy.
I can't lift it up.
Well, guess what?
You're going to start reps.
And eventually that thing's not going to be heavy.
You are going to be using your muscle.
It's the same thing with the Greek.
These are the reps that you have to do.
Right now, if I've got 30 students in front of me in seminary
and I'm forcing them to do reps,
yes, there is something sadistic about it.
There is, but there's a point where the student reaches
an internalizing of these endings that it's so satisfactory.
So satisfactory.
Let's finish up.
Last one.
What do we have here?
Finally, your definite article.
People.
Look at the masculine definite articles.
Don't those look like the endings that we're just seeing?
What do we do?
Look at the plurals.
Hoy, tone, toys, twos.
They look a lot like the declensional endings.
So it's not too far of a jump.
Look at the feminine.
Hey, taste, hey, tain.
High tone, tice, toss.
High tone, tice, toss.
High tone, tice, toss.
Right.
What about the neuter?
Notice that the neuter, nominative and accusative are the same.
You mean I don't know in a sentence whether the neuter is the subject
or the object?
No.
You have to figure it out.
You have to figure it out.
Now, how are you?
Don't, not with your brain.
Don't worry.
But just by the way, all of those words that have been thrown up into the air,
just by the way it glides around, you'll see it.
Because what you have to learn with Greek,
that you don't have to learn with English,
is universal interaction.
I'm going to tell you that now.
And it's something that I teach to all of my students through the Greek
without them even knowing it.
You're going to have to throw up a bunch of concepts into the air.
And you're going to have to be able to see their connections.
Greek, mother Greek, is all about teaching you connections.
Let's go ahead and take it down, Chewie.
For those of you who are frustrated,
for those of you who are in a position of being overwhelmed,
guess what?
We all are.
We all are.
And if you're not, you're not an ancient Greek.
What we're doing is we're coming from a step down to a much more demanding art.
The Greek language, everybody thinks languages are created equal.
Ancient Greek is not English.
It's not Chinese either.
Chinese has about 100, 125,000 unique words.
Again, that's time to the Greek.
Now you're going to have to stand up and expand.
You're going to have to meet the mark.
And how are you going to do that?
You're going to memorize those last three charts that I gave you.
You're going to do exercises.
What I want you to do for next week is I want you to work on any of those
sentences that you have in the exercises of Unit 1.
And then I want you to push ahead.
And I want you to read Unit 2.
We're going to start reading about verbs.
Next week, at AminU, I will bring up half a dozen sentences.
And I will read through them with you.
And you can check yourself.
If you try them this week, you can check yourself.
Only the ones that are in the exercises.
The exercises.
Don't look at the drills for now.
Look at the exercises.
We're going to be exercising.
That's our circuit that we run.
Now, I want to tell you before we end today, I want to tell you,
I have to set you up to receive this kind of advanced knowledge.
When you're on that course, if you can't do sit-ups and push-ups,
you're never going to get to that point where you can climb,
scale that giant obstacle fearlessly.
That's where we have to get you.
And that's what I'm working on for you.
So please, people, please, until the next time we meet,
those of you who are actively pursuing the Greek,
please try some exercises and read Unit 2.
We are not going to accept any money.
We are still not monetized.
Please do not listen to strangers who try to lure you
into intellectual back alleys where they can take advantage of you.
You are the intellectual Marines of the Renaissance.
Thank you for coming tonight.
Hail Satan.
Don't bring a group cutter.
You sing a Athena lover.
Don't bring a group cutter.
You sing a Athena lover.
Don't bring a group cutter.
You sing a Athena lover.
The devil rides out.
The Irish witch.
I'm with the dragon lady.
Don't I bring roots I cut.
I am being with Dia's love.
