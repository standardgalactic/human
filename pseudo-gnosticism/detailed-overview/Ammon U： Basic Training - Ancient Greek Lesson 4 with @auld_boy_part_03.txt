Look at that Umlaut class
Look at that Umlaut over the Iota
You know what that means?
That means you don't allow it to become a diphthong
Yeah, so it's not Leida
It's Leida
Nice, anyway, that's our word
What do you have to give to the Phoenicians to pacify them?
You have to give them the booty
Sometimes that booty is kids
Yeah, sorry, but that's a fact
When Jesus Christ says, I am not a lace-tace
After they arrest him in a public park with a naked kid
It's because the booty is the kid
Okay?
Alright, alright
The booty is the kid
That's... I'm just coming right out of the tax people
That's it
It's just right out of the tax
Give me the next one
They're gonna love this
They're gonna love this because I'm gonna throw the curveball
Are you ready?
Who is this?
This is Athena
We're back in the Odyssey, right?
This is Athena
I think this is Book 13
This is Athena
And what happens?
She applies her robdon to him
Remember, who's Athena?
She's the virgin
What's she doing?
She's following Odysseus around
And now she gives him the once-over with the robdon
And what is she doing with the robdon?
Everybody here knows that is an implement of Dionysus
And what does her robdon do to him?
She rubs it all over his little wavy limbs
And it burns up his flesh
Yeah
And what does it do?
It turns his gorgeous blonde hair
A dark color
Yeah
And it makes all his skin wrinkled
And you know he was hot
And that's what it says
The last two lines is even though he was really hot
Everybody knows Odysseus is very hot
Why do you think the virgin follows him around?
Right?
She even tells him once
It's your cunning
It's your wily cunning that really attracts me
Isn't that gorgeous?
It's a beautiful picture
Yeah
Anywho, what's happening here?
We're applying drugs again
Again and again and again
Hit the next one
Boom
Okay
What do you give to the muses?
You give them the all-gold fleece of the ram
Yeah
Okay, now remember
We're at the wedding
We're joining the church and Jesus
In the mystery, we're all working toward the wedding
The wedding is always on the fleece
That union comes through the words
The sacred song that is printed on the fleece
Using drugged ink
You want to see those angels?
Right?
You got to go through the fleece
The lamb of God is the fleece
Kind of makes sense doesn't it?
Give me the next one
Oh God, after this I saw a huge crowd
And nobody was able to
It was so big, nobody was able to number it
And from all the, where did these people come from?
They were from every group, you know
Every tribe, every people
They had all different languages
And standing before the throne
And before the fleece
And they were wrapped in white
And they had foiny case in their hands
What did they have?
What did these revelers and worshipers
Of the great and almighty
What did they have in their hands?
They had date poems
Come here, come here, biblical scholar
I just, I don't know what to do
You can't get it out of them
You can't get it out of them
Give me the next one and show me
Let's look at this word phoenix
What is a phoenix?
It's one of those Phoenicians that we were just talking about
Right, one of those Phoenicians, good
And they're living in Sidon, that's great
We've identified them as a group
So do they have Phoenicians in their hands?
No, they don't have Phoenicians in their hands
What do they have?
They have the purple or the crimson
They have the purple or the crimson
Interesting, what kind of things
Have those crimson and that purple
Look at the gowns and the flocks
You got that purple madness
Hit me with the next one
Let's keep going with the purple
And track it down a little bit
Look at this great Greek word, phoenix caimon
What is a phoenix caimon?
It's something that is stained
Right, stained red
They have the porfura
Which is that darker purple
And they have this phoenix con
That is that which is kind of reddish
It just changes in different pigments
Oh God, I don't know
I don't know the science, right?
But I do know this
We're to have that in hand
Wait a minute, curveball's coming
You're going to see Jesus for the first time
Give me the next one
I promise you people, I appreciate that
You've hung in this long
And I'm going to show you Jesus
In a way that nobody else can show him to you
Are you ready?
Phoenix chidzo
What does that mean to phoenix chidzo?
It means to imitate the Phoenicians
It means to be or do the Phoenician
You want to do the Phoenician?
Everybody's talking about Phoenician, you know what I mean?
You want to do the Phoenician?
What does it mean?
It means to imitate the Phoenicians
Uh-oh, look what some Victorian put in there
Of unnatural vice
Okay, wait a minute
I don't know, I don't know
Is this line bugged?
I don't know about this one
But don't worry, because one of our sources
Is Lucian on this
And Lucian is very happy to
Tell us exactly what it means
Give me the next text
And let me show you
It means to lesbianzane
Right?
So what is going on here in this text?
Somebody's being talked about
Is doing this type of activity
To lesbianzo and to phoenix chidzo
Right?
And to phoenix chidzo
What does it still mean to do?
Well, you know what the lesbianzo is, right?
Let's check it, Chewy
Just for the people who want to implicitly
To do like the lesbian women
Well, what does that mean?
Seriously, lesbos is an island, baby
What are those Michelinians doing?
I don't know
On lesbos, what do you do that's so
Well, maybe the Latin will help us
Look, philare
Philare
Oh
Right?
No, that's the wrong word, isn't it?
I think it is
Because philare means to do certain things
With the mouth
To produce some what became
Known as philatio
Philatio
And a philator
Listen to the Latin
A philator is somebody who performs philatio
Yes
Fantastic
So that's to les...
That's to do the lesbos thing
Yeah
Is to perform philatio
And give me the next one
Unfortunately, what is the...
Let's keep going
What does the phoenix chidzo mean?
Where do we get lost?
The star charts go on
Yep, it's the next one
But
What are we going to be doing with it?
Here's the unnatural
That was the unnatural part
Okay
Now, I want you to look at this text
