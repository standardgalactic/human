And I'm just going to translate it to you
And I want you to create the mental image that you can
Fire cannot extinguish fire
There is a moist
Stinging in my eyes
Causing me to want to grab on
To that beauty
And to never let go of that boy
What is Aphrodite doing?
Oh, my God
You mean to foin it to do the Phoenician
Has to do with that little boy that was with Jesus
Do you remember what color the cloak was
That they put on Jesus?
Do you remember that little celebration
That little, here's the man?
Oh, you're going to see what it actually is
Go to the next one
Isn't it wonderful?
When you get down to the dirt of the language
All of a sudden it's like
That makes a hell of a lot more sense, right?
Everybody writes to me and says that
It makes a lot more sense of a lot of things
That I thought of were weird in the past
But okay, okay, and what happens?
Pilate took Jesus and he whipped him
It was something like this
Here, take this, Jesus
Oh, how's that?
Jesus, you don't make any noise
I could imagine it, you know what I mean?
Just give me a second to imagine it
Come here, seriously, pull that up
Exposed, yep, there we go
Here you go
I've always wanted to hit Jesus there
Oh, Pilate, what did he do?
He mustigos in him
He mastigated him
What does that mean?
It means he beat him
He beat him with whips
Are you ready?
Why are they doing this?
It's so mean
Let's see, don't the Romans have justice?
Yeah, they do, this is it
Are you ready?
And what do the soldiers do?
They made a crown from a canvas
They took that acacia thorn
That all those freaks are using
Who are doing the Phoenician
And they made a little crown for him
Put it on his head
And what else did they do?
They gave him a purple robe
And wrapped him up in it
And ready, here's the climax
After they whipped him
Give me the next one
He's got his robe on, shoot
He stopped eating the popcorn
Give me the next one
And what happened?
Jesus came out
And he was wearing
He's wearing the crown
He's wearing that purple robe
And he says to them
Look, here's the dude
Here's the dude
They dressed him
As a lace dace
They dressed him as somebody
Who'd be doing the Phoenician
And you know what it means
To do the Phoenician?
It means whatever Jesus was doing
With that kid in a public park
At 4 a.m.
And it happens to mean the language
To enter into sexual relations
With a child
In this case, a boy
Okay, okay
Give me the next one
You guys didn't
You wondered why a pilot was like
You know, make a show here
What does he work on?
Broadway or something?
Make a show
Let's make a show of this whole thing
He was giving them exactly
What they had arrested
And that's why the people
Reacted the way they did
What happened when he went out like that?
Yeah, the crowd wanted him dead, baby
They wanted him dead
Here he is
You know, you can't even touch his headband
Without getting high, right?
What do they do in their cult?
They put that stuff over the eyes
In the forehead, yeah
Oh, God, bunch of freaks
Bunch of freaks
Yeah, and so the Jews said
We have a law
And according to our law, this dude must die
And why must he die?
He made himself the son of God
He made himself a son of God
You mean he did what Bacchus did?
He did the mystery
The sons of God came into the daughters of men
And what did they teach them?
They taught them these drugs
Look it up, it's in Enoch
Fantastic, fantastic
When you make yourself a son of God
That is a mystery process
That involves a Christing
Yeah
And it involves young boys
It is a corruption of the Bronze Age
Original
You mean our religions are all Bronze Age
Worship of satanism
Yes, of course
What do you think they got all their terminology from?
The tabernacle?
Somebody just boop in their head
I know what we'll do
We'll build a tent and fill it with smoke
Get really high and hear the voice of God
No, it's much more likely that it came from a bush
That burned
Where you can see God's backside
Is it his birthday?
Give me a break here
I'm going to take a break
People, just enjoy
Yahoo!
Yahoo!
When's your birthday?
Everybody
Happy birthday to Yahoo!
Happy birthday to Yahoo!
Happy birthday, Elohim Hashim Jova
It was in the third century
Fantastic
Keep everything in perspective, right?
You got to keep things in perspective
Let's go to the next one
I know this is long tonight, people
But I wanted to show you some really good stuff
Because I know some of you got taken advantage of
Up here, what is the phoenix?
What is that?
It's the epithemata
It's the things that you apply
The things that you're using through the phoenix
Keep going, what does that mean?
Well, that's why I brought you this one
To kind of show you what are the epithema
That's the cover, a capital of a column
A remedy for an external application
Wait, what?
It's a shaft of an arrow and it's a remedy
Okay, think about that for a minute
Think about that
We're still with the oysters
We're still with that yos
Love it
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
What is the phoenix keystays?
Okay, here we are with Jesus
He's standing there
I want you to see the picture
Jesus Christ with a crown of acacia
That they're using in their rites
And he's got everything going
And they've got a purple cloak on him
So they can show you
He is one of these
A phoenix keystays
And what is that?
It's a dire
It's a dire
It's aware of the purple
Which is exactly what he is
It's what Pilate is showing you
Here's his purple
And what is it?
It's somebody who's phoenix key zone
Give me the next one
And give me a really precise definition
You Victorian knucklehead
Give me a very...
Oh, it's the same thing
It's just the unnatural vice
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Oh, God, it's not helping
Well, what is a phoenix oboptos?
It's something that has been purple died
You mean the Baptists were not dying people
In the waters?
No, they weren't
They were using dies as drugs
And then ritually bathing
