And when the people came out
Of the ritual bath
They saw stuff
They saw uranos open
Yeah, we should go see it sometime
We can watch them
They get freaky
Let's go to the next one
So what are these phoenix oboptos?
What do they do?
This is a text that tells us
You must honor those
Who are Phoenician baptized
And bring out that light
Do you still have the...
Do you still have the voice?
Are you still using the voice?
Who are these people that we talk about?
These are the Furies, baby
These are the Furies who are going to become
Humanities
They're going to become humanities
And the chorus tells us
Oh, Earth, you bore this group
This generation of serpent toothed, nourished people
And what are they...
What are they accompanied by?
They're accompanied by a therotrophic dragon
With purple on his...
Drooling down his forehead
Wait, what did you just say?
Anthropologically, we've got a group of people
These are Thebans
And everybody knows that the Thebans are born
From the tooth of the serpent
That tooth is that stinging
It is that plague
It is the insertion of the poison
And that poison is carried by a dragon
And remember, the Greeks told us themselves
When they say dragon, they don't mean dragon
They mean a person who is a dragon
And what is a dragon?
Dragons guard monuments
They guard temples that have relics
Any kind of relic, that's what dragons do
They protect relics
And what do these dragons have?
They've got the purple coming down their forehead
Into their eyes
What does the purple do?
It blinds them
But at the same time
It allows them to see the invisible
Imagine that
Your dragon who is guarding your relic
Can see what you can't
Everybody in classics used to always say
Why is it?
Why are the dragons always blind?
Why are those seers always blind?
Guess what, people?
Those drugs fill you with light
You thought you just wanted to be healed
Of your depression, right?
They didn't stop there
They not only healed you of your depression
They filled you with light
Oh, God
Oh, God, let's get another one
Let's get another one
Yeah
Okay, go, give me the next one
Finally, what is Mary, the mother of Jesus?
Who is she?
She is the foinicodactylos
That crimson-fingered one
That crimson-fingered one
Why does she have that dye on her hands?
Why does she have that?
It's because of the group that she's with
She came right out of the temple
You and I were all there
We saw when they auctioned her off
Everybody brought their umbrella in
It was some kind of rod they were using
And they picked out one at random
They gave her, ding, ding, ding, you win
Bingo!
It's Virgin Bingo
Fantastic, but she was pregnant at 12
Maybe that's why they kicked her out
One of those angels that fed her
Yeah, didn't bring the right stuff
Because they're supposed to prevent that
You're supposed to be able to prevent that
In your priestesses
Not only that, but she could have had an STD
Because if they're not using the drugs
That the Greeks are using on the right
That prevent pregnancy
They're probably also not using the drugs
That cause you to help you to keep from getting STDs
Yeah
Yeah, so she probably had STDs too
Pregnant and STDs
Oh, poor Mary
Maybe that's why they paid her so much
Maybe
They paid them
They didn't pay the mother of Christ
How dare you blaspheme!
Yeah, they did, I saw them
Gave her a bunch of gold and drugs
Yeah, they did
Why?
Ah, they saw his star
You don't understand
Because you haven't been initiated
Fortunately, if we listen to Old Boy
And follow the path, you can be reading these texts too
And don't have to listen to a person like me
It's the way it goes
It's the one thing I can give back
It's the one thing
One beautiful thing I can give you back
Is Mother Greek
And her sexy, sexy life
Oh, God
Mother Greek is so sexy
1.5 million words
By the way, some of you tonight
We're at a talk where finally, finally
Neil asked the question to a great scholar
Of theology
And he said, tell me, scholar of theology
What?
What is the problem?
Why does ancient Hebrew only have 8,000 unique words?
And ancient Greek has a million to a million and a half
What came as an answer from that person
Was absolutely, timelessly hilarious
Hilarious
Oh, my God
Pure hilarity
Pure
Did you hear the answer?
Yes, sir
It was amazing
This is a science, people
Remember, we don't...
What happened?
Ah, somebody...
Use the force
Oh, it's not working
Help
Wow, I kind of like to look through
My name
No, okay
Let's go to the next door
Come on, people are like, get your stuff together
By the way, everybody who hates my camera
It's not my camera, it's my internet
Right?
I'm on a little bicycle on the side of the highway
I got 8 M.B.P.S.
Buddy
Fonico
Crocos
This is just the purple woof
What's the purple woof?
The warp and the woof
You know how it goes?
It's weaving
And look what they're making
They're making a zona
Don't you like a zona?
You know what a zona is?
I'll hang out in the blue fog
A zona is something that a woman wears
Around her breasts
And these things are ornate in antiquity
Aphrodite has such a cool one
That it's got a barb on it
And the barb is colored with, guess what?
The burning purple
And she can take it
And she can take it off
And she can hit you with it
And you know what happens
When Aphrodite hits you
With those...
That lingerie, right?
Sastis is the one that goes around her...
What would you call it?
Her private parts?
Yeah
And the zona is the one that goes around her breasts
Yes
And the one that's down there has a...
Has a barb
That's the barb one
And that one is...
It hits you and it stings
They call it the kestis
Some people say sastis
And what does that thing do?
It causes you to love
Isn't that something?
It causes you to love
Not necessarily a good way
In an anguish
An anguishing way
Remember the guy that we were reading tonight
Who was talking about his boys
And doing the Phoenician thing with them
