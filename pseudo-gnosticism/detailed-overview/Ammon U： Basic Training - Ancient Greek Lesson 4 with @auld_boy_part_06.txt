And he was like
Ah, it stings my eyes
I can't get it out at all
It's the moops in my eyes, baby
What's the moops?
Is the oysters, the gadfly
That stings
When Paul is talking about a thorn in the flesh
It's because he has a boy
This is the way
Sorry
Made myself a little...
Let's go
I can do this
The images are not too overpowering
Yeah
And there was a woman, Lydia
And she's the one who supported Paul
I just want you to see on that first line
What is she?
She's the local dealer
She's the Thyatyrin dealer of purple
People, I am showing you
An ancient drug dealer
Ancient drug dealer
Her name is Lydia
Oh, and by the way, she's rich
She is rich
You know what she can do?
She can send this guy around
Paul
She can send him around
Across vast distances
To go take his message to the world
She's paying for it
How does she pay for it?
She deals with the purple, baby
You shut up
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
We've got two more
Porfupoles
Look, in case you didn't believe me
Right?
Please
Please understand
We have to work with the Leicester
The pirates
We have to work with them
Right?
You thought Phoenicians were sophisticated
No
They are dealers and drugs
They are dealers and drugs
Stop romanticizing
And creating a fairy tale
She is rich
Off their flow
Of drugs
And the Romans
The Romans have had enough
Of the Leicestace
Why?
Because they're taking children, baby
They're taking children
The dude was arrested in a public park
With a naked kid
And you suck his blood and flesh
Every weekend
Every one of your saabats is full of it
Oh, God
Give me the next one
What else?
There's that dyed purple
What is dyed purple?
It's that skin, baby
It's that ram skin
Give me
Give me
And finally
Somebody's got to have those dyed feet
Probably Demeter
Demeter is the one we're talking about
From that ripe corn
Now they didn't have corn
That's a new world thing
When Brits say corn, they mean wheat
They mean wheat
Wait, we're talking about purple wheat
What it says?
We're talking about that purple wheat
Do you know how to prepare it?
No, you don't
No, you don't
But don't worry
That's what those virgin priestesses are for
Right?
Until they get pregnant
Then out you go
Right?
Out you go
Off with your head
They call that the Saturnian Reaping
The Saturnian Reaping
Oh, okay
Give me the
Nope, that's okay
Give me finally
Oh, I want to change
Hang on
I've got to change
Did we do this one?
Yeah, that was it
Yeah, that was Demeter
Right, why are their feet that way?
Why is Hecatease?
I read an explanation once
It was direct and talked about the right
And the fact that these Linnaean Bacchic rights
That they're going to involve this kind of thing
Where your feet end up getting stained
Baptize my feet, baby
Love it
Okay
Ooh, that sounded creepy to me
Let's go
I don't know
I guess you had to be there
Give me
People, bear with me
I'm going to go get the DI
And as I do so
I want you to watch
Happy Birthday one more time
Yahoo
Yahoo
When's your birthday?
Everybody
Happy Birthday to Yahoo
Happy Birthday to Yahoo
Happy Birthday, Elohim Hashim Jova
It was in the third century
Alright, thank you for having me tonight
Now, listen to me very carefully
You saw an example of somebody tonight
Old Boy
And Old Boy had the guts to work through this program
To go completely through the initiation into Ancient Creek
Has he been working on it for a while?
Yes, of course he has
Guess what?
We all are
Right?
I am
I've been doing it for 35 years
And you know what?
I still work on it every day
Every day
That's how you keep up your training
That's how you keep strong
That's how you keep ready
You pass those PTs and you're ready to go
That's what you're for
Right?
If you've got what it takes to make it through
Intensive Creek
Now, this is our fourth session
We have come through one unit in four sessions
Are we going to take so long on the other sessions?
No
On the other units?
No, absolutely not
I'm going to compel you to run forward
Some of you are saying
It's a little bit slower than I thought it would be
Yes, unit one must be complete
What are the things that you need to know?
Now, I've been dealing with office hours
And visits from people who are involved in OMNU
And want to know where am I?
What kind of progress?
Am I doing the right thing?
So I'm going to tell you tonight
The right things that you should be doing
Everybody has had plenty of time
To read the introduction in unit one
I told you for the introduction
Do not bother with the accents
You and I will work on accents together
Don't worry about accents
The history of the language, that's great
You've gotten a little bit of pronunciation in
You looked at your diphthongs
You got your alphabet down
That was the intro
In unit one, you started looking at nouns
Nouns of the first declension
Nouns of the second declension
Feminine nouns of the first declension
Masculine and neutered nouns of the second declension
That's what you must know
You have just been given the ability
To look at the words and to sound out a word
I want to show you what you should be able to do
It is the benchmark that you will rise to
In order to continue on to unit two
We're all going to have a test after unit three
People who don't run my course in three minutes
In thirty seconds are gone
Which means what?
It means you're all going to run it in three minutes
In thirty seconds
Because you all have what it takes
To get through this
Fantastic
Give me the first one
