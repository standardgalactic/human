There he is again
He looks like he's in the nominative case
So I'm going to make him the subject
Ho homeroos
Jump towards you
And you get paidei
There's your verb
Homer teaches
What?
What does he teach?
Tonado phone
He teaches his brother
Now, here's the problem
You have two accusatives
Can you have a double accusative in Greek?
Yes
You can teach somebody
Something
And the verb is still acting on both of them
It's acting on his brother
And the thing at the same time
What is he teaching him?
Technane skill
You see how skill is in the accusative case
Because the verb is acting on it
Everything in the sentence
You could jumble this thing and throw it in the air
And it could land in all different order
And it would still mean the same thing
Do you see how solid Greek is?
Your English is based on word order
You use an inferior operating system
Yeah, you do
But that's okay
We're here to give you the new one
This is a much better operating system
Okay
And what is the Bibliois doing?
Well, he teaches them with books
What are the means?
Those are the books
Yeah, how are they learning?
They're learning through the books
Feel that dative
That dative sets those circumstances
It's going to tell you how is this action
Being implemented
Bibliois with books, baby
Love it
Okay, it kind of sneaks in there
Kind of catches you off guard
Alright, here's what I want to do
I want to stop there
And what you can do is the sentences
At the end of the chapter
I should cover enough of those
To hit every point
That that unit is trying to make
So if you go back and play those
You will get every point
That the unit is trying to make to you
And if you can translate those sentences
You're performing at maximum
Good job
Those of you who are doing this
And eating it up
Because I'm getting some email
From people saying, this is too slow
I just want to run ahead
Restrain yourself
Perfect your unit one
Know all of those words
You know what anthropology means
Because you know what an anthropos is
Do you understand?
You love it
You love this stuff
Okay, I think we've done a good thing
I think we've come to a good place
I want people to know
That our momentum
Our momentum is gaining
We're about to see some goodies
I'm going to have an experiment
For you Friday
Now I will have somebody with me
I'll have somebody with me
That's somebody you have not seen
Me with
On Lady Babylon
I look forward to it
And I look forward to the chance
Of being able to bring a cure
And to be able to help
With the gift that I've been given
Of being able to learn, study, and use
Ancient Greek
It's a great honor
Now several of you are like Old Boy
You've been through the courses
And I know that you are helping people
Who have lots of questions
People have questions
And those are good things to ask
People who have already been through the course
And you can reach these people on Discord
You can reach them on Discord
And they have great resources
They have great resources there
Whole pool of stuff, texts, all sorts of stuff
Right?
Oh God, you're going to love it
We will give directions
Can we post that somehow?
In order for people to be able to talk
To people who have been
Yeah, the Discord
Put the name up there, Chewie
Give us a hand here
So that people can find this
Right?
The public one
Right?
We want the public one
That everybody can go to
As if it were a museum
Right?
And can work with it
And you may be able to chat
You may be...
I know there are hundreds of us
But you may be able to chat
With people there
Who can tell you
Oh, you know what?
Just do what he says with that first unit
And you're in good shape
Do you know these words?
Right?
They can help you out
That's a very positive thing
They would be my TAs
They would...
Oh, here it is
I posted it
I didn't post it
Chewie, thank you
Link to the Discord
Yes, and remember, Henry Cavill
Chewie loves you
Anyway, yeah
Let's do this thing
Finally, thank you people for coming
I want you to have a nice...
Chewie spends a lot of thought
That is anchored in a lot of reading
And literature
And when she puts together these videos
That are expressions of that orphic...
That orphic singer
Who is, for us, a teddy base
It's important that you understand
You're being brainwashed
Thank you very much for coming
Everybody, stay out of the alleyway
I'm going to have a clip next time
Of the answer to the question
Of why there are only 8,000 Hebrew words
Which is absolutely delicious
So suckingly delicious
I'm going to have that next time as well
Thank you for coming tonight
I appreciate everybody's time
Who came tonight
And Hail Satan
All of my love
Burning up
Lavender hot stuff
In this thing
Madea's kiss
Click bang
High purple bubble roost
Burning up my love for you
Wandering star
Roaming with a sword
Going door to door
Saving all the children
High purple livin'
Blazing up on my love
Inhale deep
Take two puffs
Just a touch
Not too much
Should get on top of you
With a little push
Three days late
What happened to your face?
Your shit went flush
Go rub a duck
Latex purple
That could work you
High purple gasoline
Madea belly dancing
In the moonshine
Childless glowing
Rayman Zeus
Operator smooth
High fire gasoline
Madea medicine
High fire gasoline
Hail Satan come to see ya
High fire gasoline
Madea medicine
High fire gasoline
Hail Satan come to see ya
