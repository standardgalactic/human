Amazonian
Let the energies touch me
And now I am no longer the same
Oh, we touch me
Oh, we touch me
And what do I want
To flood my soul
Something I've been under
And how I know
We touch me
And make me yours
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
This is Armin you tonight
And I have the fulfillment for you
I have the fulfillment
Oh, God, you're going to love this
By the way, thank you, Teddy base for that
For that opening
He touched me, very famous
Very famous him
Yes, it is
Thank you, Teddy
Tonight, I'm going to bring you something right off the bat
I couldn't start our day tonight
And just let things progress and surprise you later
I wanted to give it to you right up front
Satanic congregation, this is a gift
From me to you
Now, don't ask me where
Here it comes
Joey, give me the first
We're going to start right away here
I'm so excited when it comes to the table
You know what I mean? You put a lot of time and effort into it
What is this? The Greek reporter?
What? New find may confirm that
Amazon's ancient female warriors existed
I didn't know there was a question
In antiquity there wasn't
These people historically
Were mythologized only
When the monists gained power
These are real people
And they've been finding these people dead
And if you recall
I told you they would
Are you ready? This is gorgeous
I love this stuff, give me the next one
Joey, ready everybody? Let's celebrate
What's this?
What's this? Blow it up
Oh God, new find may confirm that
Amazon's ancient female warriors existed
Look at how excited they are
Look at how excited they are
Look at that freeze
Look at that, that's gorgeous bra
Look at the art
The Amazonians are all over the place
They're all over the place
In antiquity
Oh God, we're fighting and we've got cemeteries
These people, we're going to find out
Who these Amazonians are
We're going to find out, give me the next one
What do they say in their article?
By the way people, this is fresh off the press
This is fresh off, maybe a month old
What do they find?
Excavations of surprise bronze age
Burial sites have uncovered
Battle-scarred female archers
Now if that does not turn you on
Something is wrong with you
Something is wrong with you
Battle-scarred female archers
You mean they're just female?
Yes, they're just female
Tell me about them
Come on, I need a bear
Leading some archeologist deposit
That Amazon's the famed female warriors
Of Greek legend who are largely believed to be mythical
Only you do, they didn't
What are you talking about?
What are you talking about?
We have specific examples of these people
Are you crazy?
The fairy tale of monism has so warped
Your brains that you cannot see the history
But tonight, we're not putting up with that
Tonight, no, no, no
It's coming off, it's stripping off
Just like we stripped off grade
Just like we sought for what it was
Just like we held down the tyrant
Tonight, we're going to look at these dead women
Oh god, give me the next one
Give me the next one
In Greek mythology, the Amazons were warrior women
Living northeast of ancient Greece
During the late Bronze Age
Between approximately 1900 and 1200 BC
The source of the Amazonian myth
Is classical Greek literature
Guess what, there ain't any other
There is nothing, people
Mother Greek by this time
Had so stifled the development of surrounding cultures
And their language that she was taken over
Let's look at some, give me the next one
As one of his twelve labors, Hercules
Has to get hold of a magic girdle
A magic girdle, what does that girdle do?
First of all, what's a girdle?
Yeah, that's the part that covers the beauty
And that thing is magical
It's magical, what do they mean?
What do they mean when they say magical?
Drugs, drugs, drugs
Drugs, drugs are Bronze Age magic
I'm going to show you tonight
The real Bronze Age magic
So the people who have found the dead
Can know what they were up to
It's fantastic, give me the next one
We're getting the story time
You can bombard with images
But let's see what there is
So he had to get that magic girdle
Of an Amazonian queen, right?
Hippolyte, and what?
What, he had to get what?
He had to get her girdle
What is a queen?
A leader, a leader of these
Bronze Age dwellers on horses
Who were women
And their arts of the bow
Shape their very bones in the grave
Yeah, this is, I told you guys
This was here, I told you
And what happens, they found it
Fantastic, what are they going to find next?
Hang on, Achilles killed another one
Right, another queen
A leader of one of their groups, right?
That was Pentecelea, right?
Only to fall madly in love with her
Jerk, as he, you know, took off her helmet
And she's dying, right?
What a jerk, what a jerk
Get going, what's the next one?
Okay, now here's the hardcore stuff
People, just so you know
I'm not making this stuff up
Despite being shrouded by mystery and myth
Archaeologists are beginning to find
More and more evidence of the existence
Of these fierce female warriors
Yeah, the latest piece coming
From excavations of graves
In a Bronze Age necropolis
In somewhere, I'm not going to pronounce
In Azerbaijan, right?
Right to all our Azerbaijanis tonight
Right, because I'm going to use global people
To all of our Azerbaijanis
If we can penetrate that distance
Thank you, thank you for your work
We ate ganks to pee too
All right, here we go, here we go
The latest piece coming from these excavations
This revealed, tell us please
What it revealed, what are you digging?
From Azerbaijani dirt
Women had been buried with weapons
Such as razor sharp arrowheads
We know they were razor sharp, you know why?
Because they didn't have to hit you straight on
They would nick you
And that was enough to deliver the poison
Oh god, these huntresses
I love it, I love it baby
The women had been buried with weapons, right?
Razor sharp arrowheads, a bronze dagger
That's a candy, you know what I mean?
And a mace, bonk people, right?
As well as jewelry, dude, you got to look good
You got to look good, right?
Right, exactly
Following the discovery, archaeologists have included
There may have been Amazon women
Who lived 4,000 years ago, right?
And these ferocious women
Ferocious women, you say, whew
What a description, ferocious
Yes, they called them, get this
Man killers
Yeah, man killers
