Yeah
Amazon women they lived 4,000 years ago
And these ferocious women were known
By their male-free society
And aptitude on the battlefield
Especially with a bow and an arrow
Yes, what are they doing?
They're fighting from horseback
Using the poison arrows
And you cannot escape them
You cannot escape them
They hunt
When they go out and kill men, they hunt
Isn't that awesome?
I mean, one of their queens
Established a temple in Ephesus
And it had an image of the Artemis
The savior
And all of her breasts
And I know you're going to say
We don't know
We don't know where those are
Those are probably not breasts
And you do that
You morons do that
Flop your little Nephilim
Nephilim, Nephilim, Nephilim
Oh, Anunnaki
You, oh
Oh
How is it?
Why is it?
Because that stuff makes for good merchandise
The reality can't be sold
These were women who kicked butt
Kicked butt
They made it
We have accounts of how they made it
They would have hunting parties
They would chase down the men
And they would select them
If you were ugly
You had a safe place to hide
You hid behind your ugliness
But you capture them
And you can kill them after you
Harvest
After you harvest their seed
Right?
And then you kill them
Or you let them go
And the babies
The ones that are male
We have accounts
Now some people are like
Okay, adopt
Right?
And they'll leave their male babies
You know
You got great attendance
At the temple of Elethui
And what do they do?
Remember, she's that old
That old goddess of childbirth
That Artemis
Yeah, surprised
I'm not
You leave your baby
And they adopt it
And that baby
He becomes a servant
Yeah, he becomes a servant
They raise him
Yeah, fantastic
If you don't do that
You eat them
You eat the males
Well, they even had a word
For these tribes
They're man-eaters
They're man-eaters
Now, let me remind you
This is not developing on the male side
This is not developing
You don't have a counter phenomenon
This isn't just a simple battle
Between male and female
This is something bigger
That's generating these women
In that dig
They found that the pelvis
Had been adjusted
It had been warped for the sake
Of riding on those horses
And their fingers
Some of the skeletons show women
Had used bows and arrows
Extensively, Hughes observed
That their fingers are warped
Because they're using arrows so much
Yeah, changes on the finger joints
Wouldn't just happen from hunting
That is some sustained, big practice
What's very exciting
Is that a lot of bone evidence
Is also showing clear evidence
Of sustained time in the saddle
Women's palvases are basically opened up
Because they're riding horses
Their bones are just shaped
By their lifestyle
Isn't that gorgeous?
What do we have there?
Look at the melding
You know why you don't get that with a man?
You know why you don't get that melding
With the horse on the male side?
I'm gonna say this
And every horsewoman is gonna understand it
Before I say it
You got testicles
You got testicles, Joe
And that's why we got no male equivalent
You got testicles
Boom, boom, boom
Up and down on the back of the horse
Boom, boom, boom
Part of that is the rhythm
And you don't want your testicles slammed
You don't, Joe
So you don't develop
And as a result
What do we have?
We have horsewomen
Who only need men for breeding
Wow
And guess what?
Their tech is the high tech of the day
Not only have they changed their bodies
What's some of the other way
That they've changed their body?
People say, oh, no, oh, no
I'm a modern hoo-ha
And I don't think the Greeks were right
When they said that they did this
Look, we have Greek accounts of what they did
And why they were called Amazons
Because they had one breast cauterized as infants
They had one breast cauterized
Before it could produce
Before it could develop
And why do they do that?
Archery, brah
Archery
They do it for the archery
Yeah, fantastic
And I don't care what anybody said
The etymology, oh, no
This or that, Hezekius has got some hoo-ha
Hezekius, shame on you
Right?
In this case, I'm going to bring the heat to Hezekius
Give me the next one
What are some of the names of the Amazonian women
Who are laying there in the dirt
In Azerbaijan
Which is our new favorite place
Oystrophy
Now, for all of you who have been taking Greek
And by the way, I want to say right up front here
Our laboratories are going fantastic
The language labs
And we've got like 40 people
From the last weekend session
A Saturday session
And on this side of the ocean
And on the other side
With the people in Australia
We've got 15 to 20, something like that
And they're doing exercises
They're going over the work
That needs to be done to get people firmed up
And this is successful
This is so far bigger than any program
Anywhere in the United States
Anywhere
Yeah, definitely
We have the most students
So I want you to take this opportunity
And realize that you don't have to watch commercials for it
You don't have to buy merch for it
You don't have to pay to get your comment up there
This is not...
The devil can't work that way, right?
He doesn't...
He hates prostitution
I can't believe that
In all of that history of the devil
You find out he hates prostitution
It's like ingrained in him
