What are you going to do for money?
He kind of loves it though
Because he can throw out some coin
He can throw out some gold
Like a golden toilet
He can throw out a golden toilet
And somebody...
Somebody will crave it
It's perfect punishment
Give me the next one
That's your name
Oystrophy
And what...
Where do we get this?
Look at the root
People, you got the oysters
Right in the woman's name
You know what this is?
This is the maniac woman
On the drugs
Oh my God
What's your cousin's name?
Give me the next one
Tuxuanasa
What is that?
Ooh, you know what her name means?
It means queen of the drugs
Queen of those toxins
Now, if you had a date
With Tuxuanasa
And look at that
You can see inside of it
Is the old Mycenae and linear B stuff
Right?
Juanasa
Right, queen
Top ranker
Then no kings
And there's societies, right?
So this is the top
This is the top right here
Okay
And if you're dating her
How's your date going to end up?
Okay, you better
You better make a good impression, dummy
You know what I mean?
You better make a good impression
And hope she lets you live
Right?
Okay, when you wake up
Don't just remember one thing
When you wake up
Just know that it will eventually be over
Let's go
Where are these?
Where are they?
Okay, look
What am I going to do?
I'm going to bring up Homer
I'm going to bring up Homer
And I'm going to take you to the tenth book
Of the Odyssey
And what are we doing?
I'm just going to briefly
It's not going to take long
I'm going to briefly show you
This woman, writ large
You mean they had the...
They had Amazonians
And excuse me
I think I hit some of the panel over there
The...
If we tumble a lot of...
You know, hyperspace or something
Let me know
They had the...
We want to see that woman portrayed
And they had Amazonians
Right? The Amazonian...
A tribe of Amazonians
Right?
Because you're talking about
Very diverse groups
Of archers
Right?
Archeresses
Right?
The very word for archer
Is a female word
So...
A feminine word, I should say
That is...
It's used exclusively for women
Yeah, take that
Take that
All of you
All of you testicular
Non-horse riders
Yeah, you say you're a cowboy
But you're not nearly as good
As your 14-year-old daughter
She can ride those barrels fast
Than you ever could
You testicle dragon
Okay
What is that?
Your male dog
Okay, there you go
We got some...
We got some shouts
And by the way
As we look at this Amazonian woman
I'm not going to tell you her name
Until we absolutely have to get it
But here's the circumstances
That we're under
Odysseus and his crew
It's all men
Odysseus and his male crew
Have come ashore
And they're on this island
And they're tired
And they're crying all the time
These dudes are crying all the time
And Odysseus is like, hey, go yonder
And, you know, scout out
For what's on the island
Right?
So a group of them go out
And only one of them comes back
And this guy is crying
He's crying
And he's begging Odysseus
He's like, please don't send me back
To that place
Somebody abducted everybody
In the group
Right?
And not only that
She poisoned them
Yeah, she poisoned them
And Odysseus is like
I gotta go see this
You know what I mean?
Right?
He's gonna go
So he goes
And what happens
That's where we pick up the story
And I wanna give me that first Greek
Here's what Homer says happened
He says, look
Odysseus is coming to the sacred grove
Where the Tomatakirkes is
Where the house of Cersei is
Right?
This is late Bronze Age
Late Bronze Age
Before the Trojan War, right?
The Trojans had Amazonian women fighting
On their side
There was a contingent
Kind of like mercenaries, right?
Love it
And the depictions of these women
Oh, my God
There's one point
This woman buries an axe
In the head of a dude
Who's yelling about how men are superior
And all of his people are like
Huh?
Right?
Oh, God
It's so powerful
I love it
So Odysseus is coming here
And he says, look
What did he see?
He sees this Tomatakirkes state
Of Cersei is built in cut stone
Large stone blocks
And it's built on this piece of land
He says
You can see everything around it
Everything
It's in a valley, right?
And it's built where it can see everything
Up to the mountains that are surrounding
Like strategically smart
Now remember, this is the Bronze Age
Okay?
How much organization do you think it takes
To create one of these palaces
Of large cut stone
It takes a lot, man
It takes a lot
That's a lot of resources
That's a lot of transport
