That's a lot of construction
Okay, so this person, Cersei
This is a special time for person
Let me get the next one
Notice that she's in a sacred grove too
That's the last one
Give me the next one
She's in a sacred grove
So the area around where she lives
Is considered sacred land
Yeah
You can just by walking into it
You can get to yourself a pollution
That could end up getting you killed
You could violate something
You violate a tree
You violate the sacred leopard
Next thing you know
You got a party of horseback women
With toxins and they're killing you
That's the way it is
Now you know why the men are crying so much
Yeah, it's scary
It's scary
Give me the next one
These Greek men are scared
They're scared
So now what is around this woman's estate
What is around her estate?
You're not going to believe this
He says there were wolves
Like mountain wolves and lions
And remember there used to be a lot more
In the Mediterranean and Greece
Lions and bears, that kind of thing
But not anymore, right?
Okay, so around them
You've got these wolves
Around the palace and lions
And what are they doing?
They're screwed in the head
Because she drugs them
She alters their mental state
Wait a minute, what?
She's got a collection
She's got a collection of wolves
And panthers and tigers
And they're hanging around
What do they do?
They're on drugs
Do you see the technology from antiquity?
This is Bronze Age cutting edge technology
Not only do we build these gorgeous palaces
Of cut stone, but we have drugs
And these drugs are coming from those arrows
Of those Scythian tribes
They're coming from their arrows
They're the ones who are developing that skill
That skill, oh god
Isn't it gorgeous?
They're digging these women up
They're digging them up
I want to go now
Makes you want to go, doesn't it, Chewie?
Give me the next one
And that's the one we just did
There we go
And what else do they do?
These lions and these wolves
They don't...
I'm translating
They don't rush up on you
Ready to attack, right?
Like it's normal
What do they do?
They run up with their tails wagging
They wag their tails
And fawn
They lick
They treat you like you're some kind of, you know
Something nice
Not like a snack
And that isn't normal
That is scary
You know what that does to people?
It scares them even worse
Right?
You can't just jump in and say, oh, lion
Look, he's nice
Right?
Oh, now how is she doing this?
She's doing it with mind-altering drugs
You mean you can alter the mind of a giant cat
You can alter the mind of a giant cat
You can alter the mind of a tiny cat
If you want with drugs
I'm going to show you the specific drug they're using
To do this
Didn't you ever think of it?
Look, you've got your biggest state
These men, every once in a while, these sailors
Wash up, what do you do?
You drug them
And you turn them into sex slaves
And the ones you don't want, you kill
That's the way, brah
We all know
That the male is inferior
We all know that
We all know God's a she
What in the world
Buried in Azerbaijan
Oh, my God
Give me the next one
Yeah, oh, yeah, here, there's more, there's more tail
There's more tail wagging
Look at this, what are the wolves up top?
What do the wolves say?
These are those wolves?
They're Krater Onuhets
Krater Onuhets
Krater Onuhets
Now, what does that mean?
Krater Onuhets is the root for strength
For strength
And they're Onuhets
Give me the next one, I want to show people what that means
Now, this is always mistranslated
Here's the word Onuhs
Right, Onuhos
Are you ready? It means talons or claws
So this thing is always translated
They have the sharp claws
They're very sharp claws, like Homer just had a brain fart
And he was like, oh, by the way, they have sharp claws
I don't want to do it with anything
But I thought I would throw it out there
Watch this, there's a specialized meaning of Onuhs
Give me the next one
And what is it? What is it that these dogs are?
In tiny, tiny writing
What is the Onuhs? It's the operculum of the conjulion
Which is what? That's the little mollusk
That gives you, look at the end of the sentence
The porfura
That gives you the purple
Do you know what happens when you purple a wild wolf?
He becomes your buddy
He becomes your buddy
You can drug animals and they will become defenseless
They won't strike back
What does she say the drugs do?
She says I'm giving you a drug to make you forget who you are
What your homeland is
Forget your family
Isn't that neat? Isn't that neat?
I want a giant palace full of tigers, I do
I know why Bakus is always riding the Panthers
I know why he is
And people are like, they don't even question it
Do you know why? Because the gods have this power
I'm going to show you the line that says that
The gods, that's beautiful, keep that up there
The gods have this power
They have the power to access the drugs
That are able to do this
Imagine, right?
Now I know you can raise
I think you can raise a leopard from the time that it's born
And it can be your friend, your great friend
But that leopard is not going to accept anybody who hasn't been
It's mother
Yeah, no, no
Unless you drug them
You give them the herbs that they need
To enter human society
Think about the woman who figured that out
Think about her, she's buried in Azerbaijan somewhere
Think about her
I bet she's called queen of drugs
I bet she is, I bet she is
Give me the next one
Oh god, we haven't even gotten into all the drugs yet
Are you ready?
What is it that you're watching?
You're watching a peloron
And what is that? It's kind of a fabulous, miraculous thing
Because when you see a tiger come up
Now most of us, a tiger walks up and is licking
You've never seen this tiger before?
You're going to soil your pants
You know what I mean?
You may just fall over
Just down a complete and total adrenaline hits you
You may run off, right?
But the miracle is always overwhelming
And these Bronze Age miracles are drug miracles
Cersei Christ Odysseus
The text says that
Yeah, oh god, oh god
