Isn't it gorgeous?
Yeah, for the person who sent me something from Berkeley
I need to see those texts
There's more magical texts
Ones that I haven't seen, that they've got at Berkeley
That have to do with Christing in the eyes
And boys and stuff like that
Now I don't know, I haven't seen the text
And I don't normally talk about texts until I've seen them
So please, I need access to this stuff
Fantastic, fantastic
Now what's going on?
We're soiling ourselves because of the animals
Don't worry, they're totally on drugs
Give me the next one
They're totally on drugs
That's the pelore, right?
What is that pelore?
It's that prodigy
That thing that's out of the ordinary, right?
Oh god, and notice it refers to the Cyclops
Remember this miraculous Cyclops
With his Ku Klops
His vision is singular
Remember, he's the one who's making the arrows for Athena
If you thought Athena was not part of this whole Amazonian world
You're wrong, you're wrong baby
She's going right to the right people
Let's just show them the latest
The people are going to love this
Give me the next one
Who is this woman?
I want you to look into the face of the Bronze Age
Amazonian woman
And I want you to see what they said about her
They said, we don't know if she is a Theos or a Gunay
We don't know if she is a god or a woman
We don't know
Why?
Why?
At the level that she was at
You were required to be a god
Watch what happens
It's absolutely gorgeous
Do you have any good pics?
Do you have any good pics of her?
Oh, let's see it
Maybe there's a little bit
Look, we'll get a little bit of the warrior thing going
But I want to see her on a horse too
You know what I mean?
Let's hit the...
Yeah, we can do that too
We can do that too
I like that, don't you?
Listen people
These people were shaping the world
They were shaping the world
And we're just discovering them
And in our...
Look at what happens
You woke up this morning and you thought
Man and female, man and female
Man was going to dominate, blah, blah
Hu-ha, military, ho-ho, big man
Running around
You ought to look at Ukraine
And watch the sniper women in Ukraine
That's the homeland, by the way
The Sea of Azov
That's a huge region
The Amazonian women
Maraud through
Yeah, yeah
There are people there today
There are people who have the blood
Of these women
And when I see
I just saw a sniper from there
She got hit
Something, she stepped on something
Lost a leg
And she was in rehab
Waiting to go back
Yeah, half
You know, she's got a prosthetic
She's ready to go back
That's Amazonian
That's Amazonian
Yeah, Vlad, they're coming for you
They're coming for you
It would be wonderful, wouldn't it
If they could remember the black arrow
Oh, God, you know what that is?
That's another thing that they had
In these tribes of women
The black arrow
You can shoot it
From a distance
That you can't even see across
And take somebody out
The black arrow
Oh, God, what was the tech?
Where did they get with the tech?
They got plugged in
They got lions that, you know
Eat out of your hand
Hopefully mackerel
And what happens to Cersei?
He goes in
Odysseus goes in
But before he does
He meets a dude who's going to give him some drugs
What is she going to do when she's in the inside?
I don't think we skipped any, but
What is she going to do?
She is going to make this
Pramony and wine stuff
Which is kind of raisin wine
And it's always in a mixture that they call the cacan
So she's going to mix it into the food
She's going to mix it into the food
No, you're right
And what are you going to do?
You're going to forget where you came from
Imagine a person
And I'm going to show you the drugs that do this
Imagine a person in a state where they're so disoriented and confused
They don't know their basic identity
Yeah
What do you do when you bring that out of a person?
Here you go, Piggy Piggy
Come here, Piggy Piggy
It's time to clean up for sacrifice
Yeah, love it
Oh, love it
Love it
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
And so what happens?
What happens?
Look, Hermes catches up
Hermes, the god, catches up
He's one of the gods, too
That's why he has this knowledge that he's got
And he says, hey, don't go in there, Odysseus
Don't do it
Why? What's going to happen?
All of this bad stuff
And he goes through this list of things
She's going to do this
Anyway, he says, look, but I can get you out of this thing, right?
Right?
This is a speech
This is a speech by the dude that was really afraid
This is out of order
We somehow got out of order
Anyway, Hermes tells him, look, I want you to free your comrades
And I want you to make sure that you're okay yourself
Give me the next one
I don't know why that was so out of order
Ah, there we go
So when he comes on this place
Yeah, no, this is...
Just look at the second line
I'm sorry, people, I must have had something go on in my brain today
And I got all my slides out of order
What's happening now in the story?
I just want to tell you how Cersei is referred to
Look at the second line and the third word in
She is polypharmacost
She is... what does that mean?
Give me the next one
What is polypharmacost?
It's somebody who knows many drugs or charms
And look at what comes after that in Greek
The doctors
Who else?
Who else?
Apollo
And who else?
Now, look at number two, though
This can mean somebody who's knowledge of drugs is great
But it can also mean somebody who's given to the use of drugs
Someone who's given
So what is Cersei?
Not only is she knowledgeable
But she is an active user
Don't get me wrong
She is an active user
Of course she is
And what do you think is giving those Amazonian drug-using archerises
Real technological edge
It's that stuff they're on
They're bathing daily in the cannabis
That's a bath
You just have to take a bath
Everything else is on top
And you have to wonder how much
How much is enough to turn you into a god
