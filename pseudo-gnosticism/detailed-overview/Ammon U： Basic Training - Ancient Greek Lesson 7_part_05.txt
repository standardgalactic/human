So that your eyes are opened
Yeah
Remember what it's called?
Taking her out of your side
Taking her out of your side
Does anybody want to take an Amazonian out of your side?
Do you know the sound that Cersei makes when she gets violent with Odysseus?
Because she poisons him and says his mind doesn't go south
He stays conscious
She's like, huh?
What?
Never worse
You must be that dude Hermes was telling me about
Right?
What's going on?
Give me the next one
Yeah, hopefully I didn't get these so much out of shape
So this is, no, we did
We went backwards somewhere
We're going backwards in town
But Hermes comes up
He's the crusorapis
He's got his wand with the serpents coiled around it
Because you know this is all going back to that serpent medical cult power
And what happens?
He's coming to the house
And he's going to meet Odysseus there
And look, what is he?
He's a young man
He looks like a young man
With his first peach fuzz on his face
That's what it says
And he's got glorious youth
He's radiating youth
Peach fuzz
That's Hermes
And he's got the drugs
Hopefully, did he bring the drugs?
I want to show people the drugs
Look, people, Bronze Age drugs
Right?
That are being used
And he says, before he says, look
He says, I'm going to save you
From anything bad that this lady's going to do to you
I'm going to be your savior
He says
Take it all the pharma con esto
He says, look
I've got this incredible drug
And I want you to take it into the house of Cersei
Right?
And its strength is going to ward off
Your day of death
Yeah
It's a colloquial way they had of saying your last
You know, it's your last day, brother
Right?
This drug is going to prevent that from happening
Now, how did he get this drug?
How did Hermes get this drug?
Some of you have seen this
Watch this, right?
Look, something happened
What's happening now?
It's okay
She's going to take the drugs
She's going to prepare them
And what is she going to prepare?
She's going to prepare the cook
The what?
The cuqueo
The cuqueo
This is actually the cuqueon
The cuqueon
And she's going to put that in your food
And what?
I'm sorry
She's going to put drugs in your food
And she's going to prepare the cuqueon
Because the cuqueon is drinkable
Right, potable
And what is that?
Well, cuqueon is really just a mixture
And some of you have heard
It loses, right?
This is the big one
We're talking about the cuqueon
This is it
And sursey
This bronze age
Extremely influential
Powerful, crazy
Violent woman
She's the one who's using it
Remember the Alicinian mysteries?
She's using their formula
She's using it
And notice that it's a mixture
This isn't one simple drug
It is a mixture
Give me the next one
Watch this
She's amazed
When she uses it on them
It doesn't confound his brain
It doesn't felgo him
It doesn't mess up his brain
His perception, right?
Why?
Why doesn't this happen?
And why is this all going on?
Somebody's trying to poison that person
That person has an antidote
Why is it all happening?
Right?
Within the context of these lace dye
The slave making
Sexually dominating lace dye
The drug, he says
Hermes tells him the drug
Which I'm going to give you
Right?
This thing is going to be your salvation
You don't have to
You don't have to worry
Because he's got the therriac
Right?
To the death inducer
The thing that really screws you up
Now I told you
What drug this was
That they're using in particular
And keep going
Keep going
Yep
So, Argo Fontes
After he said these things
He pulled out the drug
What did he do?
He actually ripped it out of the ground
And he showed it
He showed it to Odysseus
Give me the next one
And what was that drug?
Right?
We want to find out
Well, specifically he says
The root turns to black
Right?
There's a black color
Or there's a black appearance to it
That it grows
As the root descends
And what is the flower?
It's white
The flower looks white
Like milk
Right?
And the gods
Who are the ones who get it
Call it molu
The gods call it molu
Or molly
Now don't think there's any association
With modern molly
Don't get excited
There isn't
There isn't
What does he say?
It's very hard for humans to acquire it
But the gods
They all know how to do these things
Right?
They know these things
Remember, Hermes is a god
And you say, wait a minute
These Bronze Age gods
Are people who are exceptionally knowledgeable
In the drugs
I told you when we looked at Enic
I told you when we looked at Enic
The sons of God
Remember that God can be a woman
The sons of God perpetuated
The knowledge of what the monist will say
This is the same group who talks about
Changing your school
So you're going to learn the Bible
Because the Bible is a foundation
For Greek democracy
Look
Excuse me
Julian
You were right, Julian
They will
They'll screw up your education
Don't you love it?
Don't you love it?
You're going to witness the downfall
