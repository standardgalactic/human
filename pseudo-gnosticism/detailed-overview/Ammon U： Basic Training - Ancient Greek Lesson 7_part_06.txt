We're going to all be reading the Bible again
Let's get as much of this as we can
Let's go
Let's go
What is the drug?
You say, what is the drug?
Here it is, molu
Molu, what is molu?
What is molu?
It's a fabulous herb
Listen to these jackasses
It's a fabulous herb
One of the later writers
Somebody said it was garlic
What?
Now look down at three and four
You'll notice you start getting plants
And authors like Dioscorides
Plenty
And if you look at number four
It's struchnon, specifically
Struchnon hypnoticon
That's hypnotic
See hypnotic?
It's sleep inducing
Well, let's go to struchnon
And see what that is
Because that's what's...
Remember, we're giving this to our animals
We're giving this to people
And dominating them
And beating them up
And abusing them sexually
Right?
I didn't say that
I was going to pull any punches
That's what they're doing
Let's see the struchnon
What is it?
It can be a winter cherry
It's several plants
The name of various plants
It can be a houndsberry
It can be a struchnos manikos
Wait a minute, I know what that means
Manikos is crazy
Manikos is crazy
Manik
So there's...
What do they identify this as?
Dioscorides, 473 gives us Dios
Deterastrimonium
Deterastrimonium
Aha!
Aha!
That's one of those belladonnas
Look at the next one
So that one makes you crazy
What is the one underneath it?
Struchnon hypnoticon
Oh, sleepy nightshade
Let me guess
That one is used in surgery
Yep
Yep
And remember
You can fumigate somebody too
Right?
So there's a lot of ways
Remember she's using food
She's using drink
And Hermes' warning to Odysseus is
If she gets you naked
She will cut off your manhood
She'll cut off your manhood
You know, you can ride a horse a lot better that way
You can ride a horse a lot better that way
I'm not sure how much...
I really enjoy riding horses
But I did it with them
You know, granted
Could I sit backwards, face backwards at a gallop?
No
Not even close, you know
Yeah
Yeah, definitely, definitely
My fingers would be misshapen too, right?
Give me the next one
Let's go to it
What else do we...
By the way, this phrase with the purpling is so common
They talk about being excited by being purpled
Your heart is purpled
It's agitated
Some kind of...
You're in a zone where you're up
And that's good because these are tropane alkaloids
That they're using in the detour, right?
In the belladonna
You've got tropane alkaloids
Hyosciamine, atropine, scopolamine, right?
That is what they're using to purple
To enter into that state
Now, you can understand why a woman under the influence
On a horseback who trained and lived all her life that way
And had to kill...
By the way, they have to kill a certain number of men
Before they can breed, right?
So you can imagine that this purpling
Brought out some traits of womanity
That are just over the top
Over the top, right?
Right?
That's what's buried in Azerbaijan
Oh, God, love it
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Let's hope they're not totally out of order
Let's see, what did I do here, people?
This is okay
What are you going to be served if you go to...
No, it's not your fault, it's definitely my fault
What are you going to be served?
Okay, she prepared for me, what?
Cucay, oh, she prepared for me the cacan
And it was in a gold goblet
Or a gold chalice
A gold chalice
And why did she do that?
So that you could drink the drug
And guess what?
That last half of the second line says
She didn't do it because she likes you, baby
She did it because she's thanking kaka
For you
Who shows the chalice?
Did you have a picture of that chalice?
If you people will remember
Lady Babylon is the one
Who holds the golden chalice
And what do we know that golden chalice is full of?
It's full of her porneia
You know the first thing Cersei tells to Odysseus
When she realizes he's on an antidote
One that Guy Hermes gave to him
The first thing she says is
I want to have sex right now
Right now
And he's like, okay
But you're going to promise you won't kill me
And she's like, okay, okay, hurry up
Right now
Why is that even in the episode?
People look at that and they're like
Wait a minute
First she tries to kill him
And then she tries to
She's drugging him
And then she tries to
She's beating him up
With her wand
She's got a wand
She's beating it
Maybe, I don't know
Maybe that was getting her going
I don't know
Maybe that's part of the whole Bacchic thing
She screams when he pulls out his sword
But she doesn't scream
With the normal scream
She screams with a Bacchic shout
She's prepared
She's going to take him down
She's going to take him down
This is going to get bad right here
Right?
Imagine this on a dating show
Halfway through the dinner
You know
She pulls out a rod
And starts smacking you with it
And you pull out a sword
And she's like, let's get it on
Right?
It never made sense
Until you consider
That we're Christing here
The text says she Christs him
Oh, God
Do you know what she has to produce
In order to get that porneia
For that golden cup?
That's a sexual act
It's a sexual act
Remember, her body
Her body is the source
Of the communion
It has to be produced
Love it
Let's get to the next one
