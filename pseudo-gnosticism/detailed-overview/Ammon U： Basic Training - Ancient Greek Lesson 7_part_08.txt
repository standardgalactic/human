It's the word for booty
For taking booty, right?
So, you know, there's a lot of pirating
Going on
Give me the last one
Or the second or the last one
What else do you call Amazonian women?
I wanted you guys to notice
You call them antianera
You call them
Those who are the
Balance
Of the man
A lot of people would say
This is the equalizer
They are the female
That is the equivalent of the male
So that's why they put here
A match for men
I told you
If you didn't think the Amazonians were connected with Athena
You're wrong, she's doing the same thing
And
What's, you know, you can see it in the language
This is how you identify
Not only are Amazonians
Man killers
But they are the man
I don't want to say
Anthodote, they are the
Man balancer
Yeah, right?
Good, love it, give me the last one
And finally, just so you can
Just so you can appreciate
The toxotis
Is not an archer
It is an archeress
And it was used of
Atalanta and of
Artemis
Look at the Orphic hymns there
That's how close the mysteries are to us
Why? Because our God
Is a she
And she
Shoots arrows
And those arrows
Are laden
With that
Which brings new life
Okay
Love it
Let's not
Stay indoors this mating season
Who knows?
All right, let me call up your
Let me call up your drill instructor
Tonight for the Greek
And I want you to watch the ending here
But this is not the ending
Exactly what you need to know
From the end of unit two into unit three
And by the way, a ton of people
A ton of people are tracking with us
And doing this course with us
So thank you for that
That's the most beautiful thing ever
I'm so glad that nobody's making
Money off this. You don't buy my hats, do you?
I don't got no hats sitting around
Right?
Let's do this
Give me the end
Exit
Let's
Save your
Your
Every single
We pledge the name
That we owe
You
I
Never cease
Never cease to
Breathe in
I'll shout
I got it
To your
Oh
Oh
Touch me
Oh
Touch me
And watch
This was my soul
Something
Happened
Now
I know
Who you touch me
And make me
You
Okay, let's get down to business
I want to show you
What you've had and what you need to know
I want you to memorize these
Four verbs
These are the six principle parts
Of the four verbs
That they have given you
And you're going to create an understanding
Of these verbs and apply that
To all the other verbs you come across
In the future. I want you to memorize
Luo
That one I want you to know
Inside and out because you're going to use
That as your example of all other
Verbs
I want to remind you
That the third principle part produces the present
Luo, I destroy
The second, and it also makes the imperfect
So I was
Destroying. The second principle part
Is just for the future
And it means I will destroy
The third principle part is the heiress
That has simple aspects
I did something
I did something
I destroyed
The fourth is the perfect
I have destroyed
And if you augment it
With an epsilon
I had destroyed
It becomes plu perfect
Extra perfect
Perfect, I have destroyed
Plu perfect, I had destroyed
And finally the fifth and the sixth
Those are both passives, a perfect passive
And an heiress passive, we're not going to worry
About those now. It's those first four
Principle parts that you are learning
And that's going to jump us into
Unit three. We're going to have the next
Section, but before we get there, I want to do
An exercise with you. I want to do
An exercise just so you can know
And be comfortable
With some of the exercises
At the end of each chapter.
Okay, at the end of
Unit two, we've got
This one, and the people who are doing
The Saturday lab, they're going through
These examples with people.
Sharpening their skills. Here we go
I'll go.
You are a good question.
That tells you.
Tois de
Xenois
Tois de
D'horai
Stefano's
This is a
men and
That construction
You've got the men up front.
This is not something English does.
Right? You could spell this out
Like you're walking through your bog.
You could do this on
On the one hand blah blah blah on the other hand blah blah blah. That's not how the Greek is working
Right look at where the men is
It's at twice philoise. Look at where the debt is. It's at twice xenoise, and you'll notice those are both
Dative cases right on the one hand you got the friends on the other hand you got the strangers
So what the Greek does is it sets up a contrast and they are always doing this they are
overusing contrast and comparison
But maybe that's why they're so smart
They're constantly
Comparing and contrasting things and that's what you do with the men and the dead on the one hand the gods
What is kill lousy?
What tense is that so many quick thank you your head yes
It's a future and how did I know that because I know my principal parts of those verbs that I just flashed up there
And I know the first principal part is keleu and I know the second principal part is keleu so and I know that an
Usi is a future third person plural ending they
They order in the future
So the gods will order Homer
What now we need an infinitive we need a complimentary infinitive to tell us what we're going to do
What the verb is going to do they're going to order them
Him to what to pin pain
There's your infinitive to send who's on the accusative case gold on
the one hand
To his friends on the other hand
They will order him to send crowns
