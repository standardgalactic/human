Jesus bound
All over but the cryin'
All that bullshit they were tryin'
Epic gates of Babylon, money changers
Clippin' tables, rearrangers
Hot purple slangers
Madea she'll work you, it's a banger
Smile away from the treeline
The man of rain
Ridin' into the sunset
My Madea draggin' venom
Chulin' the lotus
Amethyst serpent
The need for anti-venom is urgent
Athena work it
Seashell purple
Dielectric water flow
Castle Franco
Vampirella
Belacema
The dope is hot purple
Madea she'll work you
The circus an analima
Tuhefe est de masse
Heliocentric
Cult of the crow
Athena run the sky
For the Mio Maas
Try a little bit of death public
Cush on a chair head full of zombies
Original sources
Ionic omnies
Hot purple
Madea she'll work you
Hot purple
Hot purple
Hot purple
Madea she'll work you
Hot purple
Welcome back to the Lady Babylon
Ow, don't you love
Teddy bass, Orpheus
Thanks a lot for the song
Your craft, I appreciate it
Chewy, nice job
On the images penetrating
The brains of the people
It's wonderful, eyes wide open, right?
Thank you for coming back
And I want to bring to you tonight
Something worthy of your attention
I want to warn you right from the beginning
Get your splash bags out
Tonight is going to be extremely difficult
Now you know
You know it is a difficult
Topic
And it's not just one
It's a whole bunch
Right?
And Jesus
And Jesus
But tonight
We're going to do something
That may
Break the meter
So what I'd like to do
Is to be as professional
As possible
And to talk to you all people
As you're assembling
And to talk to you all
About
Something
That is so
Deep within the rot
That
We're going to have to completely
Just cover ourselves, okay?
So cover yourselves tonight
Get going, get it
Look, I had the ship going, we're going to get there
But I've got to tell you
At arm and you
I
I decided
To unplug
From my tutoring
Hut
I'm going to unplug
Because
The hut was taking
Was taking
Everything a lot
And
I need to keep the lights on
I do, so I'm restructuring
I'm going to fly
On my own
That's what I'd like to do
Those of you at Satanic Congregation
Who have written to me
Said, I'd love to be in this
Give me a place and time
Here's what I've got
Next week, Tuesday
I'll be starting a class
At my own studio
You just come to my studio
And what I'd like you to do
I'd like for you to send me
An email, do we have my
Professional email address here
Flash that up there, Chewie
So people know
Where to send their stuff
Right
The only thing we don't want
Is the nasty stuff
Not the nasty stuff, right
Keep it right
We fly, virgin air
This is wonderful
There we are
There's the address
I want you to send me an email
If you've done this before
That doesn't count
Okay, so here's what I want you to do
I want you to send
An email to me
As an application
State on the title
Application, so I'll know
This is an application
And all I want you to do
Is in that email, I want you to tell me
Where you're coming from
And where you'd like to go
And where you'd like to go
With mother Greek
That's what I want to do
And I'm going to take nine of you
I'm going to take nine of you
And I'm going to put you into a course
I'm going to put you into a course
Twice a week
One hour
This is an advanced platoon
That I am starting to generate
Now, if this is successful
I'll fill in
I can teach four
Of these a day
Twice a week without
Stressing my
Heart
That's about what you can do
Because it takes a lot of prep, man
And you've got to be in the zone
And you're dealing with people one on one
Boom, boom, boom
Right, so
This is a special
We've got a special dispensation
From the devil
I just talked to him
Fantastic
As my way of paying my bills
And what I can do is I can give it to you
In a rate
That's way reduced
Because when I was working for the hot
When I was flying for Jabba
Right
You had to charge
Crazy
Crazy, you're an average poor person
Look, we're poor people
Your average poor person
Can't afford Harvard
Right
Well, they can afford
Tutoring
They can afford tutoring
And it'll be at almond studio
Yeah, and I can get it to you
If I can get us to four classes
I can get you down
I can get you down to
You know, a rate that is
Just, you know, able to keep my
Lights on
And
Yeah, and otherwise
Feed
I love it, chewy
Love it
Yeah, I don't know
I don't know
This is what I'm having to do
I'm going private, so, but
In the meantime, I am going to
Select
The bravest
Those who will stick to it
And
Those who have that
Infatuation
The crazy of the crazies
Right, anybody
Static ring
I'm going to feed you
I'm going to feed you, Greg
And it's going to open your brain
Okay, that's what we're going to do
Twice a week, it's going to be a Tuesday and Thursday
Next week, so please
In the next few days, send me your apps
If you want
If you want, you know
And here we go, we're going to
Bring this thing to life
It's brought me to this position
That freedom from the heart
Means
Giving you something, right
This is compared to
Compared to any sort of
Education you buy
Right
This is the education that
Should be for everybody
And so, as long as I can keep my
Lights on, I can keep doing it
Because if they shut them off
I'm not going to be able to take flight
Everybody knows that
So, devil was like
Huh, yeah, I suppose
I can see, you sure you want to do that
I was like, oh, it was very reasonable
It was a very reasonable session
I was like, daddy
Anyway, give me the
What do I want you people to do tonight
We're going to go in deep
We're going to go in deep now
And I want to bring you these sources
And I want you to look at them
We are landing, what's the target tonight
Late first century into the second
On a domain
We're picking the time
Why are we doing that? There's a reason
We're picking the time
When
The
Accounts of the New Testament
Are being written, being recorded
So we're taking a sample
Of the language
The same language as being used
In the New Testament
And I'm going to bring you tonight
What am I going to bring you? I'm going to bring you
You knew what I was going to do
Okay, we're going in
To an initiation
And I want you people
To be respectful
To be respectful, okay
Nobody says anything
Nobody jumps out of line
I want you to see it
Through Mother Greek
It's gorgeous. Let's do some comments
First, where did those other two go
That you brought? Did you put those up or no?
No, those other two comments
Okay, you did
This is the second Bible scholar
Who has made their field look like a joke
I thought he was going to have a legit
Rebuttal to Armen's claim
Of the child trafficker, but no
That word just means something different
In New Testament Greek, it's called street Greek
Lol, it's meaning
In all other Greek books
Doesn't matter. Yeah, exactly
So here's one side of the coin
You see that? This is a person
Who's handling the evidence
Right? And looking to
The people, the detractors
To say, what
What can I do with the evidence? They don't
They never do. It's what makes us
