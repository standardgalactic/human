When Jesus walked up to children
He didn't just say
I've got some candy
Over in the corner
He roped them into situations
Where they were drugged
And what does the drug do?
The drug is satarian
And it causes you
To be
Aroused
Now
Inside of this
If I say aroused
You're going to think
Scientifically that's a man
No
It's the female
To be put in a state
That they describe
Openly
As insatiable sexual
Appetite
Sexual appetite
That persists
Sexual appetite
That drives
Psychotically
This is the oistress
This is the oistress
We get estrus from it
With cows
You ever seen a cow and that's
Right
They're into it
And
That's what we're doing
With the drug in the right
In the first
And second century
Anodomony
Isn't that amazing?
Isn't that amazing?
Cover it up
Please, good job Chewie
That sin almost got through there
I'm glad you covered it up
Praise Jesus
Put a cross on it buddy
Give me the next one
What else is going on in the ass?
He says I want to be that bird
Let me just explain what happens
Quickly
He has polyester
Lucius has polyester go in
And get the drug
Only she gets the wrong one
And he turns into
An ass
He turns into an ass
He turns into an ass
And what do you think happens to him as an ass?
When he goes through a lot of adventures
But the one that really
Sticks out
The one that you really need
To see
For the sake of its ritual
Is the one
Where he ends up
With his
Donkey parts
Satisfying
The
Oystress
Of the woman
Who initiates him
Satisfying the
Oystress
Look at how it's aimed
Look at how the right is aimed
If you thought
Christianity did not involve drugs
You don't know what a Christ is
If you thought that Christianity
Didn't involve sex
You don't know what a Christ is
I am here
To travel
To bring you
Your religion
I'm showing it to you
And don't worry
Moses looks straight into God's
What?
Ass
Yeah
Yeah
It's had a lot of power hasn't it
It's a spark for monism
Bruh
It's a spark
For monism
Which by the way is coming for
Everyone
Yes
No the devil was laughing about that
He was like somebody wrote to me
And said I want to know
About the vice president
Becoming a candidate
And the devil thought
That was hilarious because
Look I told you we're here
To stop tyrants
In tyranny
Tyrants do not
Respect
Elections
It doesn't matter
What are you magically thinking
What are you magically thinking
Are you thinking that
She'll take over and
They'll all go away
Now
The plague of the tyrant
Lasts
Until the very end
Of the tyrant
Sick
Simper
Tyrannus
That's why the Romans ran off the last king
And they said never again
There's something
The Greeks and some of you are
Beginning to understand this
There's something in Greek society
Where the worst thing you can do
As a human being
Is
Your knee
To a human
You're that kind of person
You're that kind of person that loves tyranny
You're willing to bend the knee
You know what the Athenians used to say about that
They used to give the Spartans a hard time
You treat those
You treat those bastards like they're kings
That's your problem
You don't have a democratia
What's wrong with you people
You don't even have any plays
Right why
Because some people
Love tyranny
Not you and I from Athens
Not you and I from Athens
No
We follow the oracles people
We follow the system set up
By the Athena
Right she who is immortal
She is worth
Bowing to
Yeah
Not a person
Congratulations
You have your yahoo
Orange yahoo
Son of yahoo
God
It's beautiful
So don't think I can't say anything about
Vice president
I've got no I don't know
I haven't studied anything about her
I don't know anything about her
But I'm not interested
There will only be a show
The tyrants don't accept elections
Even if she wins
Right do you think it's just gonna
Tyrants just what's
Do tyrants go away to Hitler
Retire to Florida
No
Once you start down the path of tyrant
You will end
With the violence
That you have fraught upon everyone else
It's a natural cycle
It's a classical
Cycle
Yeah
That is what we garden the museum
We don't care about
You know the politics and the situation
We're here for the
To watch the tyranny
Love it love it
Fantastic
Like it's gonna matter the devil's
He's laughed at that for a long time
You morons really think it's gonna matter
Have you read nobody
Have you
Totally ignored your ancestors
What are you doing
America
What are you doing
Mmm
Mmm gonna become
A connitus aren't you
All you maggots
Bunch of conniti
Where
Is he bring him out
Where is that connitus
Bring that connitus
What's going on in the snacks
I want you to see
Look people
Lacedy
I told you
Remember Jesus said I'm not
Lacedace
Here's an example of what a lacedy do
These were coming
Back from an expedition
Around midnight
And they didn't have any
Gold or silver
They didn't have anything prepared except
For one little
Arthenas and she was
Orion
Orion
Yes
What does that mean
Just having come into season
Like a ripe fruit
For the picking that's how they looked
That's how they looked at the development
Of the human body they looked at it in agricultural
Terms look at her
She's a fruit
Right
What are they going to do to her
They're going to pick the fruit
She's sitting there crying
Tearing out her hair
Mommy
Why is she crying for her mommy
Why is she crying for her mommy
Because these
Lacedy
These people that Jesus was
Hung between
Which kind of makes you think
If they put him up between two lacedy
He's probably one and that's probably
Denying it saying I'm not one
These creeps have gone out
And they've abducted a kid
And they're going to do things
To her
To turn her into a
Passive slave
A sex slave
Yeah
That's what you've got
That's the history of the people
Who are involved in the Christ
Thing and the magic
Yeah
You will drink death inducer
Says Jesus and it won't hurt you
Really
I guess I want to go there
Now you're really confused
Give me the next one
It was a good thing
Look what's going on
Here's the Jesus saying
Look Jesus said to the crowd
How'd you come out here
How'd you come out here with your swords
And your clubs coming at me
Like I'm a lacedace
Yeah
When Jesus got arrested
I want you to realize
They sent a SWAT unit
After him
They were not kidding
