Why? Because the same dudes
That will kidnap a girl
A minor
And the same dudes
That will drug boys
As apostles
And strip himself naked
And wash their feet while he's naked
That same dude
Is connected
With weaponry
Yeah, so you got to go out with the SWAT team
Right? They know
The warrant was out for Jesus
And they were like here
This kid that he's been drugging and molesting
This kid will show you
Right?
This kid will show you
Give him a big kiss
Here he is
You know what the kiss of betrayal was
For Jesus? It wasn't for an innocent dude
It was for a dude that drugged
Children
And the punishment that you have
Is being a servant
Of Christianity
I don't care if you believe it or not
Devil says
You're all slaves
Ha
Ding dong
Who's at the door
Who's at the door
Reality is at the door
This is gorgeous, isn't it?
What's going on? Jesus says
He's in the garden
It's all painful
It's all painful to the point of death
It's when he's using
You didn't realize it
But Jesus is using his death inducer
He is Christing himself
In an attempt
To stay alive through the process
And his buddies are so
His children are so drugged
They can't wake up
They keep falling asleep while he's doing it
Damn
And he's doing it with that naked kid
That he was arrested with
The reason he raised
He raised up his hands and said
I'm not one of these sex traffickers
Is because
Those people end up getting crucified
They don't care about murderers
You don't crucify thieves
You crucify
People
Who abducts
Drug
And commit heinous acts upon children
That's who you crucify
And your justice is knowing
That Jesus Christ
Is one of these
I'm sure
There are many of you out there
Who want to say
There's no way that Jesus Christ
Was such a person
Not my Jesus Christ
Okay
Then deny
That he was arrested with a naked kid
In a public park
And the kid was bandaged on his privates
Epigumnu is on
His private parts
Bandaged
The thing fell off when he took off
Do you know what Jesus was sucking
Through that bandage
Now
Galenae
If you're not in the cult
Through these words
Because everybody in Satanic congregation
Has been here
We have seen this cult in practice
We have seen it
In the words
Of the dead
Isn't that great
The whole job here was to find
Those ghosts
That's the whole job
What do you think Satan is in charge of the underworld for
What do you think his power is
It's over those voices
Isn't that gorgeous
And you're hearing it
We just sucked it out of Lucius's ass
Go
Give me the next one
What happens
Look he says
I want you to swear by the living God
Are you the Christos
Do you know what your brilliant theologians
Have done with this
Because this is what Jesus is on trial for
They know he's a laystace
And they're saying just tell us
Are you a Christos
Are you a Christos
And somebody's going to say
There's a definite article there
No there's a generic
Definite article
If you haven't read more than 50 lines
Of biblical Greek
You're not going to know that
But there is
And he's saying are you
One of these Christs
The sons of God
Is that what you're doing
Right
Give me the next one
Chewie
You didn't fall asleep
How does the Christ end up
How does the Christ end up
Jesus remained silent
The high priest said
I charge you under the oath by the living God
Tell us if you are the Messiah
The son of God
Now
We are now in a back alley
And you
Are being touched
You're being touched by rabbis
From the first, second, third centuries
And you know what they're doing
You know what they're doing
They're grafting on
Their own tradition
In order
To acquire texts
That are originally Greek
To put their own stamp on it
They're back transiting
Their jars
With all their Greek sources
That they're translating
Miserably into
Hebrew, ancient Hebrew
Which only has seven to eight thousand
Work capacity
And what are they jamming
Messiah
Did you know it's not in the Greek text
That is an original Greek text
Of the New Testament
And do you know it's Christ
It is not Messiah
That is a lie
It is a lie
And historical
Chunk of propaganda
Stuck in the time stream
Causing a
Slant
Causing a projection
Another timeline to form
Where we all believe
What was planted
Julian
Said don't let it happen man
Not to maintain
Those classical sources
So you know
By the way
This story of Lucian tonight
Is brought to you by an earlier story
Of the ass
That everybody is following
And why is everybody so interested
In this ass
Why the ass is transformed
And eventually
Eating
The roses
The great one
You see on the beach
When that full moon is out
That face
Her power
Overcomes him and he eats a rose
And what happens
He sheds his asinine form
He sheds his asinine form
But before we get there
He's going to have to encounter
The people here
In the way who are training
The boys
The people who are Christing
He's going to have to deal
With them directly and in the form
Of a donkey he's brought
To these apostles
What I am telling you
Is so popular
Because in the first century
A great riddle
Was making its way
It was a riddle
From
A Hellenistic
Priest of Apollo
And in it
He talked about the ass
That bore the gift
That through the serpent
Became your
Thirst
Hail Satan
Hail Satan, that's fantastic
Can you see it there
Give me a couple more, we'll just finish up
He invokes nemesis
I just wanted you to see
He invokes nemesis and why is he invoked nemesis
Because there are
People, there's this old dude
He's got all of these kids
His Mothetai, his apostles
And what's he doing
Is leading them around in the way
Of the Syrian
Mother
God
Look at that
The Syrian mother god
He's bringing them
To these bankwits
What are they, they're Canidoids
They're the Canidists
Who's in company
With other apostles
And what do they learn
They learn to give
Their backsides
Yes
There's a little dance
To do the dance
If you're not doing the dance
It's because you're not in the mystery
Don't worry about it
You're not in the mystery
Give me the next one
Boom
We've only got a couple more
And then I'm going to hit you with something
So
They come up to this house
Of filibus
And what happens
The old pervert
Says
He's got his crowd of boys
And he looks in the door
And he yells at him
He says
Why is he calling all these teenage boys
Young girls
Why is he calling them ladies
Right
What
He says he's got something for them
Something real good
And what is he bringing
To his Canidon
There you see it
What is he bringing them
That donkey
He's bringing them
Remember
The centaurs that we talked about
These are men
Who are part horse
Okay
