you from the book of the apocalypse right and all your Christians pay
attention remember I told you last week the guy who wrote the series coming
back or staying away or whatever it was yeah due to its lack of accuracy the
devil has put him on a special list a special list yeah fantastic and I will
remember there's a curse on the book that we're reading from the Greek text that
from the very beginning says there's a curse on anybody who touches this who
doesn't do it accurately yeah there is why wouldn't you respect that where do
you think those curses come from do you see the tradition in here the classical
tradition okay and I'm about to tell you something it's gonna scare everybody

tale you're not reading this in the Greek yeah it's gonna sound you know
crazy to you there oh how do they translate sackcloth and then they're
gonna say oh this is from a Hebrew tradition which is bull which is
completely bull yeah it's not it's verifiably linguistically not but because
people said that in order to justify see when the Christian and the Jewish
Bibles were being produced in order to get themselves legitimacy they would say
this is actually from the Hebrew when it wasn't this is one of those cases so
you're seeing it for the first time you're seeing it for the first time what
are they wearing they're wearing that hairy hairy it's got to be hairy hairy
goat skin hairy goat skin pants did you have your goat skin pants

witnesses right we've got two witnesses and we've got people and wearing the
goat skin prophesying this is typical right the the whole we could go really
deep into it and you can track where that goat skin hairy thing where that
thing comes from do you know Athena wears one of those yeah she wears one
