there's nothing doesn't say anywhere you got to be truthful to everybody all the time okay
these boys how do you think they get these boys to do what they do literally the dude has a place
where he walks people off into the hills and they come back and they don't talk about what happened
now if you're a psychologist or a therapist out there and i know
some therapists watch lady babelon um because i don't know if it's they want to give me therapy
or maybe it's therapy for them i don't know but if i told a therapist you yo brah i've got a place
let's go you and me right and then i tell you on the way you can't tell now if i told my therapist
i had that place my therapist would turn me in would turn me in and that's why jesus christ
is walking around all the time saying i'm gonna get caught i'm gonna get crucified oh you're you
believe the fairy tale and you were thinking he's like oh this is the non farting jesus right
oh i've come here to die on a cross that's what you thought right no the dude is scared
he's gonna get crucified because why because that's what you do to elastase you crucify them
it's the only answer when you get somebody who's into a religion that's so deep it is
drugging children um doing things to them that have to do with you know things that we can't
talk about on youtube um non consensual things yes right that the only solution for that and
i think most people would feel this this isn't odd or strange the only solution
is to crucify them to finish them off man those people who were willing to go that far
for the kingdom of god these are bad people they will abduct your children and cut off their testicles
so that they can turn them into sex slaves who are controlled by drugs right now i know that's
not fantasy to you right we all know that dark things happen right jesus happened to be one of
those people and that's why when he's arrested and matthew it says he raises his hands and he says
i am not elastase i am not a child trafficker i'm not one of these people who's sexually
abusing these children right that's what he says right okay okay one more i think we've got one more
is that bottom oh something's gotta keep my coat in a minute hey and um what happened so they guarded
the word right they didn't say anything but they walked around thinking about it that whole resurrection
from the dead thing that was the lesson that went out to them that's the grooming that's the control
look people whether if i want to enter an ancient mystery religion you know what i have to do i got
to shave my head i got a fast for like two weeks never fast for two weeks that's a pain right and
i'm not talking you just don't eat during the daytime that's not fast right this is a real fast
where you're not eating you're drinking that's it that's difficult right i don't want to do that
i got to shave my head i got to put on their special robes i got to go through all the ablutions
all the washings i've got to sit for two weeks and listen to some old person and they invariably
have bad breath and they're telling just chant this right oh god what kind of dedication do i
have to have to go through all of that right so the process of teaching the initiate is a process
of formation it's what catholicism does with students in seminary taught in seminary i know
they call it formation only this formation is over a much shorter period it involves starvation
and the use of psychotropic drugs
so jesus as a mystagogue as we saw last from last week as a hero fan in his mystery that is hidden
within mark is what they call his pneumatic mist gospel his pneumatic gospel he is operating
with those children your christian mystery is the abuse of children and every time you go to church
every time you drink that grape juice and that thing is transubstantiated in your mouth
every time you are doing that for the sake of a child abuser and that child abuser got crucified
for being a child abuser
i want to stop there with the tags
and i want to tell you the future is the two witnesses the beast is revealed the future is
the restarting of that mystery that travel that is the final frontier you cannot go
any further right here we can go from star to star from planet to planet right we're looking
with our scopes and we're doing everything that we can to get as far get as far away from our
origins possible at least get our minds out there so we can understand what's going on
this type of travel is the next dimension it's the next dimension up and it's that
form of travel that we get christianity from it's that form of travel that we get judeism from
and ultimately with some development you get islam right your islamic ancestors are worshipers of
Aphrodite and Bacchus and we're not going to get there unless we go with them it's the whole
right right so um let's get busy and bring those two witnesses um here's what i here's what i have
for you by way of news so um i and i don't want um i'm i've i've obviously used all of my time up
tonight so i'm not going to go through unit three i'm going to save that um i started um my classes
for people who volunteered and there was an overwhelming number of volunteers and i've
i've got four classes now and i've got one for england class alpha beta gamma class gamma please
um for those of you who are in england or europe who want a class that that's not going to be at
2 a.m right um please i'm getting slots available i've got like four slots left if you are from
a place where you know if you're from europe this is the class that will work with your time zone
and what we're doing what are we people doing we're building an army of people who can translate
these texts for themselves so that we facilitate another renaissance and the outpouring of of people
who are just possessed by the classical muse is amazing if you haven't gotten picked yet i'm still
working um and i'm trying to get as many people as i can i'm trying to get as many people as i
can i'm considering just a class on literature because some people are at the point that they're
like i just don't want to go all the way to the greek but i want to learn this literature so yeah so
that's what i'm doing uh is trying to create facilitate that environment i'm thinking about
maybe a class on literature as well i don't know if i can though i've already got four and that's
going to that's going to take along with my students that i tutor privately it's going to take uh
it's going to take too much time so i just want to say thank you for the people who are um going to
go ahead and enroll in the 20 weeks and uh we'll have time following the 20 weeks as soon as we
graduate those four classes there will be more slots available more slots available so and people
have stepped forward and said hey i want to give a scholarship i want to support somebody who can
who can do this now that i'm free and i'm not working for my boss who's taking 30 percent
um i can pass that on to you so i am i am more than happy to take scholarships and spread them
around to whoever gets them and otherwise it's the cost of a movie right and by the way i've
been told i just want to say this right and nemesis please understand that i'm not trying
