price of a movie ticket i'm trying to it's a price to keep my lights on i'm trying to
get people trained so that they can really participate they can really taste that that beauty
that's there in the language so yeah yeah and i've got people offering scholarships and whatnot
so and i don't want any of my t a's to pay my t a should be able to take all the courses for free

i'm still calling i'm still um emailing people and getting things going but we will turn this
from a youtube channel into a university youtube channel right with faculty that can help you get
to a point that you're you're working on these texts let me just say one thing i want to say one
thing about a student former student of mine who's going to be coming back into the reading group
his specialty is bizantine greek i won't tell you his name or anything but his specialty is
bizantine greek hey that's the stuff he loves man and he gets all high on bizantine authors and
i love so i worked with him for a while we worked on late classical sources kind of the bridge
to the biz heavy bizantine stuff and um he's coming back because he wants to do some reading
in classical now and he went away to dumb barton oaks oh my god it's an intensive
bizantine greek program and he told me all the authors that he read through um the point is
what i am trying to do here for you is to create people who are functional
ancient greek translators people who can go and with enough sweat and blood can pull out
these incredible thoughts of the dead the thoughts of the dead fantastic and that's the
only way we're going to read the bible too is if we go back to the original and since i'm going to
be cut off here soon and you people listen to me you know how it works i say it's going to happen
right and it happens and then i come on and say i told you i'm not going to be able to sit i
told you this time i'm not going to be able to say that because this type of speech that we're
exercising this salon is going to become prohibited because you can see it's a threat
to religious power right threat to religious power long live the republic long live freedom
and uh maybe we can bring back justice to this place now that we've told her to leave
for what the sake of a trip on a yacht can you believe humanity was sold for a trip on a yacht
what kind of oh god never mind never mind it makes me mad okay thank you for coming tonight people
um i i love your i love your dedication and uh thank you it's a real pleasure and look i took
us way too long it took us an hour and a half tonight but i want to tell you i thoroughly
enjoy the time that i that i spend with people and just seeing what i've seen in the applications
