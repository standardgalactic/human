It'll be bereft of life, right?
And the trees, trees, where these things hang out, you know, they, you know, they, they
become sterile, man, got no fruit, got no fruit.
Seriously?
Wow.
That's a tough one.
Yeah.
He says it's quite incredible.
It's mirandum est, right?
Incredible.
Right.
But even if a drop of this stuff touches, it's really, it's really dangerous stuff,
you know, and it causes certain problems.
He goes into it.
But okay.
And there's no cure.
Medellum.
Look at the bottom.
It says, we know there's no cure.
There's no cure for this thing.
Yeah.
Go for this class of drugs.
There's no, absolutely no cure.
That's plenty's assertion.
Yep.
Is there a stormtrooper in my closet?
Thank you.
Are we ready?
Get him.
Go.
Source.
All right.
Look, the force of these things, I just want you to see, we're going to start talking
about flames, people.
Flames.
Wait a minute.
You mean in this formula that we've got, this medic formula from this communion, you
mean it's associated with flames?
Yeah, it is.
And petroleum products.
He talks about it, but it's specifically associated with flames.
Okay.
Where does that come from?
Logically, people think about it for a minute.
Where does that come from?
Those vipers possess a flame in their venom.
If you don't believe me, try it.
You'll be screaming all day long about being thirsty.
You'll find it.
You'll find the thirst.
We'll give it to you.
They induce it all the time, right?
What do you think the prophets are doing?
Excellent.
Go to the last one.
Just go to the next one.
Yeah, we've got a couple more.
We've got, no, next one.
Boom.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
Look at Esanie, Esanie.
Look, from this thing's mouth, there's such a sunny, there's such an awful, awful poison
flows out, right?
It produces three plants, produces three types of plants.
Wait, what?
Now you're getting into an area that, you know, it's going beyond.
It's going beyond a little bit, right?
What kind?
Tell me.
What kind of shrubbery do they have from this place, right?
Right?
Give me the next one.
There's food and drink involved, people.
We're going to be putting this stuff in food and drink.
Yeah.
Right.
There's, so, of these plants, types of plants that come about in conjunction with the formula
that is derived from that venom.
What is happening?
Well, one type of these things, you know, if you drink it, if you drink it, it gives
you mente mutata.
It gives you what?
Look at that second line, mente mutata.
If you consume this stuff, it gives you mente mutata.
That literally means a transformed mind, vertitur in rabbim, and it turns you into
a rabid person, rabid, makes you rabid and changes your mind.
Why would I want to do that?
Okay.
Well, that's one of them.
Do you hear?
These are associations made with the drug, right, that they're using a venom to produce.
And what happens to it?
The people, the next type, you know, if you taste it, even if you taste it, it causes the
taster to die.
It's necum.
It's slaughter.
Dude, you can slaughter someone with this stuff.
Oh, you mean the aconite?
If you go back, if you go back, yeah, they're going to find this guy in the library from
Herculaneum.
Nicander.
If you go back to Nicander, you'll see which plants he's talking about.
Are you kidding me?
Are you kidding me?
No.
No, I'm not.
Those plants derive their poisonous quality from the serpents that live around them.
Okay.
When you hold up the serpent, you're holding it up as an acknowledgement of where the
true medicine is.
You want to live to 150?
You want to live to 150?
Then you go where the serpent is.
Right?
Everybody knows that.
Shh.
Marcus Aurelius.
He started taking the theriac.
Let's go.
Go to the next one.
Boom.
Boom.
What was that third one?
