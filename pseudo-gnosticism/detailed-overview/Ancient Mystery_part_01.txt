So Epiminides is a Cretan. Yeah. And Epiminides is passing down this quote of Medea.
And we have people who pick this up and quote it.
We're establishing what's called ancient authority.
So we have people who are quoting different sources, right?
And sometimes the sources don't survive.
Okay, so fantastic. And who is this? This is a survivor.
This is Calimacus because by the time we get, oh God, by the time we get to Hellenistic Greece and Alexandria,
the concentration at the Museum of Nerds has reached a pinnacle.
We are about to have the catalyst that just blows our society into civilization, baby.
Oh God, this is a place where you can go, right, Chewie?
Forget about Rome. We'll go. We'll head to, you know, the Junction. We'll call it.
Oh God, I love it. Okay, who is this? Calimacus in Alexandria.
And what does he say? He says the Cretans are always liars.
Wait, what? This is in a hymn to Zeus, baby. This is in a hymn to God.
Those Cretans, they're all liars. What did they do? Oh, Wanox.
Look at that. First line, second and last word. That's a Mycenaean title.
We're going back to 1600. Oh God, this is old stuff.
So Calimacus knows this because, you know, he's just, he's read all the scrolls, baby.
Right? How many of these are there? Oh my God.
Cretans, they built you a tomb, Zeus, but you don't die.
You are always your perpetual man. You're perpetual.
That's what, that's how Calimacus jumps in and uses this old expression.
Those Cretans are all liars, right?
This is before the Epimynidaean paradox.
If he's a, if Epimynidaean is a Cretan and he says all Cretans are liars.
What do we do? We're stuck. Did somebody tell that guy to get off the top of me?
Right? Oh my God. Bring us some. Oh, look at that. Who's, oh, this is fantastic.
Look, it's penetrating the brain, Chewie. I love that.
You should have been a, you know, some kind of psycho militaristic interrogator.
I don't know. Let's go to the next one. Hit me with the next one.
Here's the reconstruction people of what it is. Right?
They made a tomb for you. Oh, most holy and great one.
The Cretans did and they're always liars and they're bad Theria.
Now a lot of people translate that as beasts. As a matter of fact, you see this one does beasts.
Right? That's actually a loaded term though. And we know that from the Theriac.
We know that from the Theriac. Here we go.
You people who don't want to farm, you don't want to build in the ground.
You don't want to build the nourishment up that brings us all life. What do you want to do?
You want to trade at the time it was trading. Right?
That's what remember, by the way, I got to say at this time in the world,
you can put some of your mesmerizing things up now, Chewie, at this time in the world.
Yeah, yeah. We've got to understand how is the world divided in the Mediterranean?
How is it divided? It's divided between two types of people. It's not races.
It's not any sort of physical attribute. It's not a geographic location. It's not a tribe.
Yeah. You know how people are divided up at this time when Calimacus is doing what he's doing?
You know, people are divided up into Greek speakers and barbarians.
Yeah. Did you hear me? They divided you according to whether or not you could use Greek.
Now you're sitting there and why is that? Because everybody knows.
Ask those hot-dwelling Romans. It's way more sophisticated.
Yeah, 1.5 million. Oh my God. Is that the last estimate of the unique word form?
This is, you know, did it get that high? Oh my God. Yeah. Right?
Remember that three-year-olds got about 3,000.
Yeah. So you've got to put this in perspective.
The world is divided into those who can use ancient Greek and those who can't.
Bur, bur, bur, bur. Sorry, Anglo-Saxon.
You notice Anglo-Saxon is sitting on a stool and that stool is Greek?
Yeah. Our sciences wouldn't be our sciences without the power of ancient Greek.
She's the most sexy mama, ancient Greek.
Oh God. Imagine a language that allowed you to coin words on a steady, regular basis.
Can you do that? No. Not my Anglo-Saxon mind. Right?
Oh God. I need to chop some wood.
Yeah. Okay. Let's go to the next source.
Oh, this is beautiful. Watch what happens, people. This is a reconstruction.
I just want you to see here at the end. Look at it.
So there are these consumers, right? And what are they there?
He says to the God, he says, but you, you don't die, right?
You're always going to be Zeus living, right?
Or, and this is the last couple of lines, for in you we live and we move and we are.
Yeah. Wait a minute. I've heard that before. Who quoted that?
Oh, guess what? Let's see. Let's see who quoted that. Boom.
Boom. Axe. This is when Paul the apostle is standing in Athens.
The hill of Aries. And what is the hill of Aries?
The hill of Aries is the place that justice was born.
Oh my God. Oh my God. You mean this? We're going to talk about justice.
Yeah. You're right. Right. Right. And in them, we live and move and are.
Look, it's the same. It's the same thing. Right? Right.
In this God, we live and we move and we exist.
Yeah. Just as Paul says, some of your prophets used to say, what are they?
What have they, what have they said in the past? What have they said?
We're the same. Get us. Oh God. Oh, this thing is gorgeous.
Right. So Paul, what is Paul doing?
His drug-addled snake venom, doting, using, shooting.
Mind is so riddled. See, he doesn't practice the city in the way.
Right. The city in ways balance. Yeah. Yeah. Not for Paul.
Paul's drilling that stuff. He's got the thorn and the flash, man.
He's got the flow. You haven't had it so you don't know. So don't criticize Paul.
Excellent. Sorry. Sit back down. I didn't tell you you were free. Paul, sit down.
Give me the next one. Hurry. We've got to, there's a great, it's going to get serious here.
Watch people. What did the Lord say?
The Lord said, it's not good for the dude to be alone.
So I'm going to make, he really says, let us, let us.
Yeah. Let us make a bow-a-thon. What is a bow-a-thon?
For those of you, I'm about to shatter something, conception that you've had.
Are you ready? When this was shattered for me, I was like, oh, it's like a breath of fresh air.
What is the ewa or the eve? What is the eve to the ademas, the indestructible, right?
The clay. Oh, I'm sorry, sir. That's clay. No, it's not.
What is the eve? And what does she do? She is a bow-a-thon.
Huh. Well, let's find out what that word is. Let's find out what that word is. Next one.
Here's how the new international translates it. It's not good for the man to be alone.
A helper. A helper. That's a special helper friend, right?
Remember, we're talking to the Hebrew of the third century when we're looking at these passages in the Septuagint.
So you have to realize it's on a completely different level.
