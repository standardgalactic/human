Give me the last one.
This is the hymn.
Who's the star?
Who's the star to Bacchus?
Who's the star to the wine?
Who's the star to the...
This is my blood and my flesh.
I'm the Son of God.
Who is it?
Hit it.
It's Simile.
It's she who is made in purple.
Who is it?
I call upon the Korva.
I call upon the Korva who is all queen.
She who is beautiful, informed.
She who has that depth of her corpus.
She's the mother of the thersis-waving, joy-causing Dionysus.
Life of the party, it says.
It says he's polugathus.
And what happens?
What happens?
You know what happens in her presence?
Those pains.
Those pains of the mother.
They are abated by means of a fire-bearing sunshine.
Wait, what?
Don't worry.
It's drugs.
It's drugs.
I was explaining to someone earlier today.
The semen of Helios is a drug, right?
Do you know what they call Jesus's semen?
I'm going to give you this one.
I'm going to give you this one.
By the way, the semen of Helios is supposed to make you healthy and vigorous.
Yeah.
I'm going to give you this one.
Are you ready?
This is good.
No, I felt bad.
I started to feel bad because it's been an hour.
And I don't want to hold you guys any longer.
Because I know everybody's got important stuff to do.
And it's my privilege to be able to be here with you.
It's my privilege to be able to be here with you.
And I'm going to have a talk tomorrow night with a bunch of my new friends in Australia
who are health professionals.
Yeah, going to have a talk.
It's going to be fun.
You're welcome.
Please come if you'd like.
If you'd like to come.
I would love to have you there, Satanic congregation.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Let's go back.
Let's go back to the...
Give me the...
Oh, I was going to give them.
Look at that.
I almost forgot.
I almost forgot.
Yeah.
It's the hobbits.
What is it?
There are no such things as hobbits.
Do you understand?
Something was going on.
Canitis, baby.
Did he just write?
Did talking just write the canitis?
The tragedy of the canitis?
Hobbits.
Anywho, what is the goody I'm going to give you?
The semen of Helios is a drug.
Also, the semen of Jesus was called the love of God.
Isn't that gross?
Seriously.
Isn't that gross?
Right?
The love of God.
Right?
It was so bad the Romans were arresting them.
Right?
Because what do they do?
The representative.
If it's not Jesus, it's an apostle.
If it's not an apostle, it's an elf.
It's an elder.
Right?
If it's not an elder, it's a bishop.
Right?
All through the first five centuries of Christianity.
What's going on?
What's going on?
Well, when the Romans are in charge, they're getting arrested for taking orphan boys off
the street and doing naughty things.
Right?
So it's a part of the right from the very beginning.
There's a reason that Jesus Christ was arrested in a public park with a naked boy.
It's not just an accident.
