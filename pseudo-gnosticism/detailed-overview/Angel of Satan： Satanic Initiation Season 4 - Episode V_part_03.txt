You see, it's used to passion
It's used to passion
Is there a connection between this flocks
And the stuff that we gave you in your drink
When you were coming in tonight
Is there something different?
Is there something?
Nope, it's the same thing, it burns
It burns, ask any physician
Any physician around town, you know
Let's go to Rome
Let's take a side trip to Rome, guys
And let's step out in the first century
Let's ask a physician in Rome
Hey, bro, does it burn?
And he says, what do you think they call it?
The burning purple idiot
And you say, okay, can you tell me something
About why that is?
Great, ancient physician
That's because the heat
That's because the what, the heat
The heat of what?
The burning seed, brah
You got the heat of the burning seed
That causes you to thirst, right?
Ooh, what happens when you thirst?
You get a lot to drink
Yeah, yeah, these druggies, I tell you
I tell you, you people
I mean, this is again, again
When I say you people, I'm not talking about
The congregation of Satan, right?
I'm not talking about those
Those of you who worship the muse
I'm not talking about those
I'm talking about everyone
That those watchers talk about
Yeah, and I'm thinking how do they get to the point
Where their cult creates their society
And the one that is dominant
Is the one that started
With sex and sex drugs
Yeah, sex and sex drugs, man
Yeah, that's what the Christian foundation is all about
Sex and sex drugs
It's why they're forcefully raping children, right?
Purification, brah
It's a Christian purification
And from that, you can get the golden vessel
Love it
You want to be born again, Tommy?
You want to be born again?
I know your parents aren't here
I know your parents aren't here, Tommy
Yeah
You ever see the devil, Tommy?
Yeah
Christianity
Thank you
Thank you Christianity for these
Roots of our history
And now you know why the watchers
You know, now you know why
They wear the colors that they wear
It's just too late
They already put on heavy gear
Right?
Okay, back to Sodom and Gomorrah
Let's go, where's the fantastic
Look at this, a flame of fire
Fire is the element, what is that flux, right?
Well, it comes from that burning
It comes from that shining, right?
And you've got it as an element of nature
It's a very element of nature
That's what burns in Jesus' eyes
Right, the flux, ros
Let's go to that one, yep, let's see that one
Oh, we've already seen that, we don't need that
Let's go down to the death
That's the death, yeah
You know, write this to that, you know, to that church
To the angel that's over the church in Smyrna
Yeah, because that angelos, we all know, right?
Remember Paul's got his angelos
He's got his
And these churches have theirs
Did you think you were going to get into the cult?
You knew you would, right?
It's gorgeous
Okay, so let's keep going
What are we supposed to say to these people at Smyrna?
Remember, we're getting our visions, right?
This is all visions, John is having visions
He's taking into the Eremon, right?
And I'll show you in just a second, but here
And yeah, to that angelos in Smyrna, you know, write these things
The first in the completion is talking to you, right?
The one who became dead and flamed out
That's actually an heiress, isn't that funny?
People want to translate, this came to life
Because it fits, it fits the fairy tale
Ryan, where's Mr. Rogers when you need him?
This is gorgeous, this is gorgeous
You guys, I'm telling you, New Testament scholars
Can I just take a step back today
And say New Testament scholars out there
You guys at the seminaries
Dude, you have done such a poor job
You didn't even thank for a minute
Hey, if I want to understand this one document
Maybe I should read everything else around it
Maybe I should know how words develop over time in Greek
Right? No, that's not what you did
It's not what you did
