Clot, you lousy, lousy, shoddy stuff
That's what brings, you know, that's why we have to have that whole apocalypse thing
Guardians let down
Let's go to the next one
Yeah, look at this, here's the...
Look, you can have this same root for that
One that means to live or to burn
And you can have it to bring something to life
Look at this, the Therion
Zothentosoma
Yeah, that Theriac, the beast
Right?
Bringing back, bringing back, producing
Hmm, interesting
Yeah, makes me smell Aphrodite
All of this purple drug use
Makes me smell Aphrodite
Never forget, that's where we are
Okay, next text, we've got a couple more
We've got a gift
I just wanted you guys to see the Aphrodite
Right, look at how they translate it
These are the people who are on the Aphrodisiacs, right?
In plural, it's the worshippers of Aphrodite at Rhodes, right?
Oh, the lessee of a public brothel
So, when somebody tells you that cup of porneas is waiting for us
Yeah, you see?
Don't do that
Don't do that
Don't...
They think it means to offer flesh to idols
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
They think it means to offer
To eat meat offered to stones
They don't realize
Right? How could they?
You guys coated this stuff up too much
Right?
We've got to go back to the great people to make sense of it
And when you do, it's shocking
What's the next one on there?
Give me the next one
Look at this, this is just zaho, right?
Oh, just drink some of this in
Just drink it in
To be burnt alive
Woo, that's something
Okay, let's go on
And to that angel
Yeah, that's in Thyatira, the church at Thyatira
Write these things
Say, Ho huyos tu feyu
The son of God
Ho egon tu saftal mus
Au tu
Who has his eyes as what?
Hos floga puros
As that flocks of fire
And he's got those feet
Those calcolibanic feet
And you say, what does he have?
Net mean, net mean he has brand's feet
Ha ha ha
Yeah, no, it's bad
I shouldn't laugh, don't do that
It shouldn't laugh
It's not funny when you desecrate the temple
It's not funny
Okay, let's keep going
Let's keep going
Yeah
And to that guy
You know, he's got the, we're done with him
Yeah, whoever knows the deep things
Ba tha tu satana
Do you know the deep things of Satan?
Did you know it was possible to know the deep things of Satan?
When a cultist walks out of history
And walks up to you and they're all dressed funny
You know, they got specific garments
Maybe it's the all one color
And it's got little fringes of this
And they, dude, they smell like
They've walked into a perfumery
And it exploded around them, right?
That's what they smell like
I mean, you know, it's kind of neat
You could put that person on an altar
Burn them and it would make the whole place smell great
They did that with fingers in the middle ages
So yeah, fantastic, fantastic
Let's go back to our text
The next text, yeah
Those are those who know those deep things, right?
Of Satan
And we don't, we don't
Because, you know, you're just a bunch of time traveling
Historian, investigators
Trying to bring forward a warrant
For Jesus Christ
And we're gonna catch him with a naked boy
In a public park, right?
Fantastic
Let's do another one
I will give to him
Ton astra, ton pro, oh, inon
See that lulumat looking thing?
Oh, the yod?
On that last word
That means you pronounce it too
It doesn't get sucked into any vowels around it, right?
I will give to him
The morning star
I will give to him the morning star
What is this with these people
