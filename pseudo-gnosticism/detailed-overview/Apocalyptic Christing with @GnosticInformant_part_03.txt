All you people who have so much respect
Come here, Paul, here's your venom
Oh yeah, you want to go to heaven, Paul
Yeah
Yeah
Sick, sick junkies
Go to the next one
Here's the collurion
And what is the collurion?
Somebody wrote to me and said
Hey, how do you tell about dialectical differences
Right, because we read that comment
And said Hebrew has no
In dialectical differences
Between something
That supposedly is written by Moses
And something that was supposedly written
You know, 700 years later
What?
There's no dialect, you got no dialect
How do you tell that kind of stuff?
Or collurion?
That Omicron Upsilon in the middle
Will drop to just an Upsilon
Depending on where you are
What dialect
You're speaking
This happens to be Ionian
Ah
Do you love that? That's how you trace that kind of stuff
Through the vowels
Neil is going to talk about
Some vowels tonight
Love it
So do it Neil, you better get that done
Good, alright, are you ready?
Collurion, what does it mean? It's a passory
Wait, Jesus is telling me
To put a passory in my eyes
Yep
What is a passory?
Can you imagine
I was laughing with Chewie today
Chewie said something about Victorians
You know, and Victorians speak
Because Chewie reads a lot
Of Victorian literature
You know
Anywho
You know, we have to look at it
Through their lens
In order to define some of these words
You know, you can imagine
You wouldn't say something the very same way
You know
You'd besmirch yourself
Right, go besmirch yourself
Let's see
Passory, what's a passory?
It's a little pill that you take
And you put into one of your body's orifices
Right, now there's two that they use
On the mail you can use one
To direct them, but typically
These are developed for women
To use vaginally
For the sake of
Of stopping conception
For the sake of abortion
For the sake of the regulation
Of a
Minstrel flow
Be it too much or too little
Yes, and for the sake finally
Of STDs
Yes, yes, they claim
That certain STDs
Are treated with certain plants
And animal products
That's fantastic, so you make a little
One of these, choleria
And you take it, and what do you do with it?
You apply it as a medicine
But look at number two
It's also an ISAV
An ISAV
And it usually comes stamped with a physician
Seal, right?
And look at number three, it says
It equals cholura, well look at that
But what are these things
Little pills that you
Will prepare by
Heating and robbing and then adding
Some of them are added to liquids
Turn it into a paste
That you then apply
To your eyes
To
Your eyes, now I know
There are not many of you seated in the audience
Tonight
There are not many of you seated in the audience
Who will have ever applied
A psychotropic substance
To your eyeballs
But you can see people doing it
You can imagine somebody doing it
It doesn't take a lot of
A lot of
Imagination to stretch to
Christing
Christing is something
Chewy, you can see them
Christing, you can see what they're doing
Fantastic, go to the next one
Go to the next one
Boom, and what is the
Cholura
Well, they tell us here
They tell us here it's the colics
Well, what's the colics, give me the next one
They're playing a Victorian game with me
What are you doing
To roll
Wait, what, to roll or loaf
Yeah, a roll, excuse me, a roll
Is that a, no, it's a roll
Or a coarse bread
What?
Look at number two, because that's how
I always see it, torojisco
Robbed and taken in wine
It equals a Cholurian, they're talking
About the shape of it
It's a little cake
It's a little cake, it comes prepared that way
You go to your drug stand
You take your doctors
First of all, you use your doctors prescription
They tell you, you need this
Put it in Christ, put it in your eyes
And you go down to the drug stalls
And you say, hey, Dr. Sonso
Gave me this, what do I need
And they bring up a little bit
One of these little pastiles
They'll bring up one of these little cakes
For you to take, one of these little trojisco
For you to prepare and they'll tell you
This is how you prepare it
And you will go home and you repair it
Just like they told you how to do
And you will Christ
That child's eyes
So that you can burn off
Their immortality
And make them more
Immortal
That's what you need to do
No problem, I can do this
The priests will tell you
Bring these drugs to the initiation
Right, this is all
Contemporary with Jesus
Who's walking around
Wearing the same drugs on his face
In the Garden of Gethsemane
That they're using
And ritual, there is no separation
Christians will come to you
