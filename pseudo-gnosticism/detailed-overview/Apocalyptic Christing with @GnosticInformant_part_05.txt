It's very banal and it makes fun
Of very simple
Processes that would cause us
All to enter into shame
Hide your shame right
Well comedy doesn't hide your shame
Comedy takes it off that cover
Right it lifts up that kilt
And shows you exactly what's underneath it
And that's what Aristophanes is doing
And I figured that's why he'd love them
Why I should bring him on our date
This is the chorus
And we're going to read this backwards
These are the lines that follow
The introduction of
Cersei into the discussion
And this
We're going to read it backwards
This is the chorus in the chorus
What does the chorus say
It says look
You're Cersei
You're the one who
Anna Kukosan
Who mixes together
The drugs
I know you're the one who prepares
The cocaine
It's the same route
I know you're the one who
Maganeu san
Who is that
Magi
You're performing that magic
And what else are you doing
What are you doing
To your lovers
Or your companions
These are the people that she keeps
Captive
What do you do to them
You moluno
Where's the, give me the next, right there
What does it mean to moluno something
What does it mean to moluno something
It means to
Disgrace it, to stain it
To diet
To
Baptize it into the defilement
The abomination
Baptized
That's what she's doing to them
Hmm, let's see what that is
Let's see what that is
It may be interesting from those
Back to the text
Good, she defiles those companions
Right and
What is the spirit that is moving all this
It's pure joy
Pure erotic joy
And you know what we're going to do
We're going to mimic
The son of Laertes
Who's that, that's Odysseus
We're going to mimic Odysseus
And we're going to string that guy up
By his testicles
Don Orcheon Kremomen
Let's
String him up by his testicles
Why would we do that
Why would we do that
So we
Can spread
Poop
On his little nose
Like a goat
And he can say
Mommy, mommy
I'm your little piggy
Yeah, that's what it says
Right, right
That's what's going to happen
We're going to do what, Chewie
Did you get that? This guy's a weirdo
Aristophanes, what's he talking about
Hit me with the next one, let's clarify
Let's clarify, remember we're reading backwards
Where do we, oh by the way
Just in case you didn't think
The smear with poop
Was
Was
Real, look we're not, this is educational
Get your act together, Chewie
Listen, to be smear with
Dung, that's that Victorian
Way of saying to spread
Some feces from
You know where, on your nose
On your nose
Look what we're doing
People, look at number two
We're making an abomination
Until you see that
Abomination of desolation
Sitting in the temple
It's going to have
Poopy spreading powers
Why, people
Anthropologically and historically
Why, seriously poop on the nose
What's that going on, because if you
Are engaged
With the right
You are besmirching
Yourself with the seed
You're going to get poop on your nose
Yeah
Straight up, people
That's why Aristophanes
Is making fun
Funny, where are you
Sticking your nose
Okay, let's go to the next one
It's ancient Greek comedy
Huh?
Who invented this stuff
You know who invented comedy
Was the Greeks
I'm sure there were
Calculative people telling jokes
But it was the Greeks
Look at the Revelation people
Who are these people who
Stained themselves, now for the Christians
Who want to think that there's a distinction
Between their world and the pagan world
Watch, they're using the words
The exact same way
Who is really going to be favored
With Jesus Christ when he comes back
With his golden bra
It's the kiddies
Who haven't malunot
Themselves with the ladies
Why
Why
Because the stain
Is part of the right
And that stain
Is coming from the cup of her
Pornaea
She is born up
By the theriac, by the beast
She balances
The beast, don't you know
That kid needs his
Mortality burned off
Give me the next one
Give me the next one, look people
What's going on, I'm going to give you the next lines
From Aristophanes, they're the first lines
I did the latter half of
This is Karyon
Speaking, and he says
This is what I'm going to do
I'm going to mimic
