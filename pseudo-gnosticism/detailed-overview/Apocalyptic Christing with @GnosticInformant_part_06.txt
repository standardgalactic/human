I'm going to copy
Cersei, the one
Who prepares the drugs
And the one who
Gives those companions
Who makes them that power
She persuades them
What does she persuade them to do
He says they're in Corinth
What does she persuade them to do
She persuades them
Because they're piggy-piggies
Eat a poop
Estian score
Score, you know what score is
That's what comes out of her
Backside
Score
She compels it, she deals it out herself
It says she herself
Brings it out, she molds it
We're going to follow her ways
You little porklings
Going who, who, who
Oh, I want it
Mommy, I'm a piggy
That's what it says
Look at the last line
We are the little pigs, mommy
Give us the score
Like a goat
Like a goat
That gets my goat
That gets my goat
It actually gets my goat
For people who missed
Penelope last time
I'm sorry
And if you'll notice
We are censoring both
Penelope
We're covering up her sin with a cross
But some of you may notice
A strange phenomenon at work
Something funny is going on
Our
Grand artificial intelligence
Is
Giving us things
Perhaps it shouldn't
We got to censor some of those as well
We will cover a multitude
Of our sin with a cross
We will do it, we will do it
I love you Penelope
I love you and I love seeing
Your sin
I do because it reminds me
Of the cross, of the Christ
Who puts that stuff in those little kids' eyes
Yeah, I love it
He is no
Child trafficker
Roman SWAT squad
Woo
Let's go back
We're almost through it
Then I'm going to call on Neil
Who knows what he's going to say
He told us he would stick by
Alice and Hesechius tonight
So it should be good
It should be good
Let's go
He doesn't want to take you out of Back Alley
He doesn't want to take you
He doesn't have to worry about that
But you have
Names
In Sardis, right?
And what do they do?
They maluno themselves
They maluno their gowns
They maluno their clothing
Right? No
You're going to go around with me and white
You're going to go around with me and white
Because
You're worthy, baby
Do you see what's going on?
There's a thing here
Between Jesus and his
He's connected with the stuff
Those kids and he have formed
A relationship
He's saying unless you can enter the
Kingdom of Heaven in this way
You can't at all people
So drink your snake killer potions
It won't hurt you
Watch this for the one who overcomes
He's going to be wrapped up
In these white
Hymations
And I won't blot out
Their name
From the book of Zoe
Right? We still have
In Christianity
We still have
That anti-monist tendency
To reach out to the Eve
We still have
A drive to do that
Right? Okay, go to the next one
It's underlying the religion
It's underlying the monism
And what now? What's the real
What's the real, okay
We've been talking for a long time
About cult stuff
People are starting to understand
More people are getting interested
Starting to open up those texts
Wonderful things happening
Gorgeous
We're riding a wave
Right? We're riding a wave
All we have to do is get this out there
And you will see the renaissance
People will be born
Because that's how it is
It's not anything
That I invented
We're not going to sell it
Or bottle it or anything like that
This is just stuff that happens in history
Soon as the classics start bubbling up to the surface
The monism loses its strength
And what is this?
I've been talking to you for a long time
And I really
Haven't shown you
What happens
When you have that communion
When you enter
Into that death and resurrection state
What are those things that they're trying
To do
When that little boy is with Jesus
Right?
What are those christings
Actually achieving?
This says what the christings achieve
Says from the throne
Pour out
Those of you who have ears to hear
I forgot, those of you who have ears to hear hear
He said that about 18 times by now
Okay
From the throne
Wink, wink
From the throne
Pour out what?
Show me what these are
He says these are the seven
Holy Spirits of God
Being God has seven Holy Spirits
I thought he only had one
And that one plus one
Plus the sun make three
