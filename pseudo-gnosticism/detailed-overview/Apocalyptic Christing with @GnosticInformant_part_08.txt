remember the cunecus the the uh the cynics the dogs that's that look at honey with snakes feet on
so you're so we're we're dealing with ye or yeos having to do with drugs having to do with Venoms
having to do with bokeh chants mourning rituals let's keep going yeah arrow what arrows it's
always it's you're gonna notice uh you're gonna notice a trend dipping arrows and poison apollo
Dionysus mourning or rejoicing either you're mourning for the death of the god or you're
rejoicing for his resurrection watch this we're gonna keep going so that's the arrow the same
exact word can also be a voice or a cry as Herodotus ascalus and Euripides all report and
their different sources so it's either an arrow or a cry right that's weird all right yay the word
yay by itself is an exclamation of joy or grief can be either one it's a shout by the way you
notice how in english we we do this we when we're happy we go yay yay it's like it's like wired in
our our society to do these things the ancient Greeks set up the society and it's all trickled
into our culture we don't even notice it i love it so that's that yay exclamation exclamation
so i'm going to keep going on the yas i have a lot more to go but just out the top this is from
Hesekius's lexicon where he says yatai is healing yatra fees for healing whatever that means
yatros is a healer a prophet or an ancient hero or apollo right yaw yaw yay yaw yay is sleeps
so you're gonna get this is another another thing we know it's the incubation cults
of magnagracia they're they're big into these ancient mystical asclepius apollonian rites of
incubation and uh and psychedelics so you're gonna see a lot of sleeping and incubation and
resting with the yaw root in there yios bed yaw sleeping right yaw sleep because they slept or
was sleeping what's going on here let's continue with our with our search so here we go we got yay
as a voice to a shout or to be awake uh yay doness yay doness joy desire and happiness so notice
how it has to do with the state of consciousness whether whether it's rejoicing or it's morning
it has to do with that bachic mania bachic mania that that's everyone you know about bachic mania
right now that's the big thing but if you also notice it has to do with yat yator means doctor
yay tori means medical um let's see here wrapped tied wrote mourners so epithets of apollo there's
that one that we just talked about yay yos so let's continue now if you now if we if we tune
that vowel from yay to yo we get something similar right so once again we see arrows
with yaw yosin yaw yosin arrows right violet colored purple colored yolada purple there's the
purple again we that's another reoccurring theme that keeps popping up see this word right here
from colonicus yoson yosonos yosonos purple belt what all right and then on the top yobacos
bachis dianesis the bachic rites all right so just you know this is you can always come back to this
what look at this other one yo aid this black flowery in a in appearance or purple so you're
seeing the common commonly throughout all these different yo yay ya yay and uh um yo ye yay
and you all of these are tuned vowels with the iota on there and they all have to do with purple
drugs arrows or healing or some sort of shout right let's continue now now we tune the vowel to
the oop salon and we see something once again very similar you uh yunk yes which means dian
it's another name for dianesis and it's like without fail we see piercing we see purple
we see shouting we see drugs we see some sort of desire some sort of love charm look at this one
yuk yuk's uh yuk's which is love charm the bird the bird is said to be suitable for enchantments
it is also called renec it is said that aphrodite used it from the bird the charms used in love
spells are called yunk yes so that's the name of dianesis repurpose as a love charm used by aphrodite
it's like wow it's all comes full circle let's continue bachos this is where she gets crazy
because remember what carl karen he said in his book he said that the ancient form dianesis is
yawakos and that it actually turns out that according to the according to ladel scott middle
ladel and lsj that bachos comes from the root wachos the diagramma gets hardened over time
like a like a fossil does and becomes bachos so wachos and yakos is from yawakos or wawako
that's a lot going there's a lot going on there the name of dianesis is yawakos and it's right
there to see in the in alice if we continue then we get that bindweed again right and this has to
do with healing yasione bindweed or if you look at the top yatso of a violet color purple
drugs once again yatso violet color purple drugs healing here we go with yos yos is either arrow
or poison what is going on this is so abundant in the sources the yaw and yaw has always to do with
arrows poison purple or chanting or some sort of healing ritual right it's without fail it's all
over the sources i have so many of these by the way yasione is the mortal that's loved by demeter
also no it's also the word for bindweed or purple color here we go again yasis healing
right purple color that's the same word yatso so here we go healing is yasis or yaw mai there's
that yaw oh literally yaw is in there yatso purple color right yatso also can mean to cry
aloud so it's either a drug to either a shout or it's purple or an arrow or something right
here we go again yatso violet violet color yasis healing again there's the yasion or also called
yasis is the secret mystery he's one of the twins of the of the the the divine twins the diascorides
the diascory yeah it's yasion and treptolomis are the two twins uh here we go so all right i
showed these already and i just want to show something one one more thing i want to show
so yat you mentioned yatra and um if we look at all right we look at the yos where he went through
those if you look at the yas we get the healing and stuff like that but it's also yay here's another
one yay voice shout joy desire fruits purple see that word right there yay yayness purple once again
this is a totally different vowel now so we've gone through yeah we've gone through yo we've gone
through yo yota epsilon now we've gone through yo yota upsilon and now we're on the fifth vowel
yota eta which is total the same exact definitions pull up again doctor doctor uh purple fruits joy
desire shouting all the same motifs are popping up with the eta vowel right oh and before i go on
to my last i just want to just want to uh show something about the lace stays real quick the
word lace by itself means booty or spoil so you understand that lace stays literally doesn't mean
trafficker i didn't even know how right amon was until i figure found out that latest by itself
just means booty or spoil so if you say i'm a lace stays you're saying i'm a trafficker of booty or
spoils it's it's actually like it's yeah pirate and buccaneers fine but like to literally break down
the word what it actually literally means it's booty spoil trafficker all right so last thing i
want to share this is fascinating stuff those vowel tunes with the yota it's like a magic wand
i'm telling you get your main ad out there get yourself a fiercest staff tie a pine cone to the
top and then put a ribbon purple ribbon on there and just carry that around that's your magic wand
baby you got to have it all right last last but not least i have this is also from hisekius
and i just want to show something right real quick this is from hisekius this is the yotros
you mentioned yotros as you were speaking about revelation of the the apocalypse the apocalypse
by the way apocalypse is a common word in the orphic fragments so if you read i'll give you a prime
example one of the oldest books in the world that's that was found in massedonia it's called the um
it's called the uh shit i can't remember the name it's the papyrus that they found
in massedonia it's an orphic papyrus someone in the comments is going to say what it is and i
i'm not looking at the comments but thank you for whoever the you guys all know this stuff
but there is a mass there's a manuscript that was discovered in massedonia in like the 1960s
or some i don't know but it's it's dated to like the fifth sixth century bce at the time of um philip
of massedon and it's attributed to orpheus it's an orphic theogony and like the word apocalypse
shows up in that text like 50 times about orpheus revealing orpheus is a revealing he's apocalypse
orpheus the the and it calls him the theologian so those with the word theologian and apocalypse
are from the orphic text apocalyptic literature for some reason gets oh that's jewish apocalyptic
literature is jewish i actually know before it was jewish it was orphic and by the way the alexandrian
jews in the third century admit this you just look at read their own stuff read aristobulus
read those guys from alexandria writing in greek talking about orpheus as one of their own profits
the word samoi means to play with the harp anyways yotros is a epithet of apollo
just wanted to throw that out there so this is from this is all from hisekius's lexicon
and he goes through all these words in the in the uh iota section and you can see the iota alpha
is filled with all of these purple drug arrow shouts there's so many of them like yeah by itself
purple colored can mean purple colored flowers yakkar is the the kuan aster the dog star baby
the dog star that's also a title for isis too by the way um
yak ton crown he sleeps twisted a flower right yeah i'm just gonna run through these real quick
and then i'm done uh ian ian umai rejoice ian atai angry right iakes to shout
yakketsai shouts yakon apithet of dianysus lament right uh morning let's see
we got more shouts we got more purple more purple drugs right we got
rejoicing we got you i mean you guys get the point by now by the way i pinned on the top of
the chat do you want to look through these yourself it's in the original greek from hisekius i pinned
it to the top it's actually it'd actually be a good exercise for people to go through that
and try to translate them plug those words into um into perseus tufts one by one get your grammar
up that's what i've been doing that's how i made this list right here i've been going through them
one by one and plugging them into um this is this is how i got this list that you're looking at right
now every single one of these words i plugged into perseus tufts and found out what it meant
and it's from hisekius's lexicon so once again shouting you're gonna see shouting a lot it doesn't
matter if it's iota plus alpha doesn't matter if it's iota plus eta doesn't matter if it's iota
plus epsilon it doesn't even matter if it's iota plus amicron or iota plus uh omega iota plus any
vowel you're gonna get a whole list of words that have to do with medical drug stuff purple
healing or some sort or like venoms or something or an arrow sometimes you get the quiver the arrow
or the quiver sometimes you get epithet of Dionysus sometimes you get epithet of Apollo
sometimes you get shouting sometimes you get mourning but those those are common throughout
the entire lexicon of greek iota plus any vowel is these secret mystery words it's fascinating stuff
so um look by the way this one i wanted to talk about real quick
iano iano uh kredemos iano kredemos wait i'm sorry iano kredemos
a poison applied to the headband isn't that something so when you when you put that word poison
with kredemos it becomes poison applied to a headband so and by the way there's that
kray i don't know if that has something to do with crystals but i've noticed to apply it
you get the kray in there i don't know what do you think about that
um i would say because it's a he on the rio side i would say no but don't that's a guess right no
oh i don't like guessing who bring a job keep going man i'm sitting here like eating a popcorn
gorgeous well that's what i so i can go through the rest of this list i think there's only a
few more anyway yeah there's only a few more trip oh here here yeah let me let me share this again
just to finish this off and then that's uh just to show you what else is in here there's a lot to
do with healing therapies so yatio yatui therapies right um healing and then like even fees for
treatment so i'm guessing that this this comes out of the parminidin orphic magic uh asclepian
schools of healers you understand what i'm saying well because they were there was probably some
sort of fee for getting your loved one in there i don't know whatever i'm just guessing i have no
idea where that were fees for treatment yatra and then this one right here yatui is nymphs called
around ellis and healing so it's like you can get two completely foreign concepts that mean the same
thing and it's either healing drugs or some sort of purple drug or some sort of shout i mean healing
purple drugs or some sort of shout so what's the i don't know i just want to i just it's all i'm
doing is i'm looking at the sources i'm not even giving you my own thoughts i'm literally just saying
this is what the sources say there's a lot of purple here there's a lot of drugs here there's
a lot of shouts here there's a lot of cultic rituals here a lot of Dionysus a lot of apollo
and um yeah what do you what do you guys all think about this
fantastic i think it's fantastic um uh look at what you're doing now i want to refocus people
and say look at what neil is doing he's performing a linguistic analysis and it's typical classical
philology that's what that's why classical philology is a science and it's very reliable um
because it's just basic look he said to you i'm just giving you the sources and telling you what
those things meant but look at the the thing special that he's doing i want you to take note
he's using Ezekius who is that ancient Greek grammarian so um and Ezekius is using a source
that's earlier he actually gets traced back to the a Hellenistic source i forget what his name
is eris starkus or something like that and that guy is writing a lexicon of unusual or what he calls
are get this poetic he says poetic words he so Ezekius cites he cites quite a few sources
one of them is deogenius from the time of hadrian eris starkus of samothrace the one you mentioned
is one of the big ones apion heliodorus and another source named amerias so Ezekius has
got all these sources of grammar and he's putting together a bigger source of grammar and this is
how we get ellis today ellis is based on what Ezekius started and that's all it is it's just
building up it's just more noses building upon more noses let me ask you this let me ask you this
neil so um two questions why do you think it is that greek has grammarians and um we don't have
any hebra grammarians why don't we have any hebra grammarians left um what's going on
that i that i don't know but you know you brought this up not now i got to go here because um
people say that yaoi is a native god to and they don't they they know it's not from ugarit
he's not a canian like god everyone knows this this is not a hot take in the ugaritic text which is
the pre pre hebra sources of of of canan right everyone's like ugarit ugarit ugarit ugarit you
got l you got ashura you got bell and you got you got other gods there too right there's no
yaoi in any of the ugaritic sources so it's like where did yaoi come from so this is the big
leading theory right you know you hate theories right but just let me play this you're gonna
love this you're gonna love their promise the leading theory is that he comes from the midianites
down in the south all right why why why do they say that well they found some archaeology of
this name yaoi down in egypt and that these sources from egypt say he comes from the comes
from the midianites sure fine let's check out the midianites now all we don't know much about the
midianites but we do we we have dug up their city their major city midian and guess what we found
out about midian i got a screen that i'd like to share so midian pot this is from the uh encyclopedia
