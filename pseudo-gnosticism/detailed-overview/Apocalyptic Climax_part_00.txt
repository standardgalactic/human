You're gonna love this.
Mary Poppins
Got a big bag of juju
Where the Necromaxes hang out
And the darkest grew
Coat mystery
Purple drugs on your face
You're at the Roman Crown Circus
Scandalous Jesus
Pharmakia Medea
Got him twisted out
Child sex traffickers
Hung on the cross
Pedophiles fetching gibbits
Fucking hell Satan bitches
Push up the muse
They couldn't hear the dragon tongue
Express effigy
Dark horse
Grim Reaper riding
Rumble bum bum
Drumming tribal
Well, back to the Lady Babylon
That was steady base
Thank you so much, steady base and chewy
For that work
Gorgeous, brilliant job
Boy, have I got it for you tonight
I've been waiting for this one
Thank you for coming back
And thank you for being here
Satanic congregation
Shout out to the sisters of frustration
Out in the lobby
Doing their thing
They sound so disappointed, don't they?
Yes, yes, forget the rumors
Forget the rumors
Tonight we are going all the way back
All the way back in time
We're gonna find our way
We're gonna bring something
Something forward
What you get tonight
Before you get scared away
I hear people are horrified by me
That's terrible
Before this night
You didn't get what you needed to get
Tonight I have not come to you
To prophesy
I have come to you to fulfill prophecy
Tonight Satanic congregation
Just for us
Just for us
We feast on the beast
Thank you for coming
Thank you for coming
Oh, thank you for coming
Where is my whip?
Yes, we're gonna take a short break
Before we get to the climax
And we're gonna have another video
Because these things are telling a story
I just, oh, I love it
I love it, it's Orpheus
Back alive, I love it, fantastic
Chewie hit us with the first
Let's go in, let's go in
Policent, boom, right there, don't
Don't, we'll wait for you to know who
People, look, I wanted to tell you this
So much last week, and I won't belabor it
I'm not gonna belabor any of the sources today
This is a user-friendly edition
Right, we're here to have a good time
This isn't some kind of class
This is fun, are you ready for this?
Thank you for your time, by the way
Everybody out there who's given their time, thank you
I wanted to give you this last week
This is from a source, this is Haseke
I said, I know people will say
It was so late
How can you use such a sort?
Mmm, okay
Hasekeus is, excuse me
Eustatheus is using his own sources
From antiquity
That nobody else around him is
Failing themselves of
He's like the one bright spot
In a stinky dormitory full of monks
Oh, and there he is, he's got these sources
Anyway, he says right here
I just wanted to bring it up for you
He says, look, this is the very rise
Of Greek culture, it comes through
The Leistes comes through Leistea
This is Greek culture
If you don't understand what that is
Go find out
For the Satanic congregation
Hear me, hear me
When I talk about the Helians
Know who they are
And where they came from
Indo-European, ha
Let's go to the next one
Chewie hit it
Now, here comes the real stuff
I told you, I told you
Tonight we get something special
Thanks to the graces of Lucifer
We have tonight this gorgeous fulfillment of prophecy
Are you ready?
We're gonna do this together
It's like having a baby
Let's do this, are you ready?
Oh, this is the apocalypse
What is going on?
I don't know what that was
But it sounds sexy
I love it
What happens?
They figured out the beast
They what?
They figured out the beast
They discovered the beast
Ew, isn't the beast
Yonder creature with necks and flames
And scarlet horse sitting
Thank you for killing everything
Classical civilization brought us Christianity
Thank you, my salute to the queen
Oh my goodness
Bring it up, bring it up again
Boom
Let's watch this fulfilled, are you ready?
They discovered, determined precisely
They determined precisely the Therion
What is the Therion?
Take it down, what is the Therion?
The beast, what is the beast?
Yeah, it's that which bears up Lady Babylon
It is that which brings the cup
That's the beast
Are you ready to dive into the beast?
Are you ready to find it?
And the Christianity will give you all sorts of images
They're the most hilarious, self denying, lying sacks of
You know what?
What is the beast?
What is the beast?
Yeah, let's watch the fulfillment
What happened?
They figured out the beast
They determined the beast
And who else was using the beast?
I mean, what is the beast?
Bring us, bring us back to John
Come here, John
You little, you disgust me
You disgust me, John
You have everybody you should have known
Oh, you thief
Little thief
Sibling oracles
Let's watch what happens
Are you ready?
Are you ready?
They figured out the Therion
And the pseudo prophet
He was using it
Making signs
Via the agency
Of the beast
And in these delusions
They wandered
Everybody who took the haragma
Wait, what?
Haragma
Do you hear that?
There's no blockage of the air in the he
He, he, he
Everybody say that
He, he, he
Haragma
Haragma
Haragma
Right in the middle of that text
What are these people doing?
They're taking the haragma
Give me the next
I want to see what is this thing
Look, here it is
Blow it up
Haragma
Oh God
I'm sitting here with anticipation
Chewie, hit the next one
The next one, yeah
What is it?
What is it?
Oh, my goodness
Blow it up
Blow it up
Oh, good
Haragma
Look, it's from Haraso
Oh, lovely
And what's it mean?
It's a mark engraved or imprinted or branded
Now look at the Greek
Everybody in the Greek
And be careful
The atheists won't be able to keep up
Right there
They all felt it too
Right, every one of them just went
Ow, was there a bug?
Did I sit on something?
They were right to me
Where did I get these black and blue marks?
You got them on your buttocks, atheists
Okay, what is that?
What is the haragma?
Look at the Greek people
The Greek right here
The haragma ehidnes
The sting of the viper
Right, what does it say?
What does it say?
What does it say right there?
It's very bite
Give me the next one
You mean you want me to see this?
You want me to see what these people are doing?
