You know why it's so incredibly valuable
Let's keep going
Let's keep going to the next one
Boom
Oh, what else does he say about it?
Well, I may go back in a second, should we?
But we can reverse in a second
Look at this, people
I just want you to focus on the second word here
Pomata
What are pomata?
Pomata
What are pomata?
They are drinks
Potions
Sometimes translated as spells
Do you hear how bad
Christian translators are?
I'm here to say
Your history, your intellectual history
Is laughably bad
Laughably bad
Yes
Yes, for those of you who think that you invented democracy
Your awakening is my joy
Is my joy in this gigantic penal colony
Called Earth
Your awakening is everything to me
To be able to see your reality
Is that Jesus Christ was arrested in the public park
At 4 a.m. with a naked boy
While he's screaming, I'm not a child trafficker
Your awakening to that reality has given me such pleasure
It's a pleasure that no one mortal should be able to share
Just without any sort of people to enjoy with them
It's like selfish of me
Yes, but to see that, that new birth into a reality
That's something
And I appreciate, I appreciate you giving me that experience
It's right at the top of everything that is beautiful
Thank you, thank you for that
Transformations, I love it
Let's go to the next text
People, I wonder what the next rumor is going to be
Alright, here we go
Yeah, and I sent an angel
Right, and what is he going to do?
He's supposed to witness
Right, right to you people
Right to these churches
Why? Because I'm the root
I'm the root of that defeated clan
I am hoaste, holampros, hoprinos
Oh God, if you don't understand that's an incantation
You haven't lived in antiquity
Fantastic, look at this
He's the star
What is he saying at the bottom? He's saying I'm the star
Who is this? Jesus
Anybody notice we were talking about Jesus?
Congregation of Satan, shout out to Jesus baby
Isn't it going to be gorgeous?
Isn't it going to be gorgeous when we all come to knowledge
And we have perfect precise vision of history
And we see him there
And we know who he was
Oh God, am I going to feel stupid?
I am going to feel so stupid
If I bow down to that pedophile
Yeah, we know he's already been convicted
All we have to do is show the evidence
And it's a wrap up, case finished
Right, nobody wants to follow a pedophile
Right, let's discuss though
Okay, let's do it
Stop saying things
I'm sorry, sometimes I hear you out there
I know it, I can envision it in my little mind
I can envision it out there and I love it
It turns me on, I thought I heard somebody say something
Okay, just think, I'm right there with you
If you're in your car, I'm with you
I'm with you driving, don't get distracted
Right, some of you are overseas
Some of you are at your jobs right now
Tell your boss, tell me a favor
Tell your boss, you're listening
You're listening to Lady Babylon
And if he doesn't give you a raise
Something, something cosmically ugly
Will be imputed to him or her
Yeah, greed
Tell him, hey, I've got a new morality for you boss man
Greed stains your soul
With a stench, a stench of ruin
Oh God, oh God
Love it, love it
Okay, let's go to the next one
Let's get charged up with some really good stuff here, right?
Oh, what happens, what happens?
Oh, who's that?
The devil, what does he do?
The one who made them wander in their minds
The one who took them to that expanse
You remember, Paul was there
I saw what you did, Paul
You went up to the third and started messing around
You know what that weakness of the flesh is
And that's why it's better that you stay with your apostles
Do we have pictures of the apostles?
Do we have disciples?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we've got them
Bring on the kids, where are the kids?
Oh people, now here is a very...
Look, thanks to the gift of AI
We are able to now represent for you
With stunning, amazing realism
The historical apostles
Right, look at this kid
You know what he's doing?
You know who that is?
You know who that is?
That's James, man
That's James, who's that?
It's one of those sons of thunder
I know that, maybe he's the one on the back
Maybe he's the one on the back
I don't know, I don't know
Peter's in there somewhere too
Let's hear from the queen
Where's the queen in her little drawers?
Oh, my goodness
Where's Peter?
Surely his wife
Wait, his what?
You think Peter was married?
It doesn't say anywhere he had a wife
Oh, it says he had a mother-in-law
No, my queen
Just in case you didn't know
That was Elizabeth straight from hell
Straight from hell
Elizabeth, shut up
It's a basement, sub-basement
That's where we keep them all
Yeah, okay
Yeah, so it's the word for...
It can be the word for sister-in-law
It can be anything
And guess what?
You can have in-laws
And not actually be married, right?
So there's no...
There's no evidence that this kid
Had any sort of...
He was with his family
And Jesus is like, come on boys
Right?
Okay, stop, stop
We've already been in the trial
Satanic congregation is not here for that
They're not here for that
Secretly they are
Go to the next one
Oh, God, what is that monstrosity?
What is it with Christianity
And all of the...
Sadomasochistic weirdness
What is that?
There's something that's...
That's primal
That's primal
You know what I mean?
Get a group of Romans to beat him
Beat him
Oh, yeah
Feels so good
Notice there are a bunch of people watching it too
Love it
Go
Yeah, and so...
Oh, yeah
So the devil
We're back to the devil, right?
Diabolos
And what happens to him?
He's the one who's just putting these images
Into people's heads
Right?
And he's thrown into the lake of fire
And Thayu
What is Thayu?
Thayu is what you purify with
Thayu is what you purify with
We, sons of John
We bringers of the light
What do we do?
I'm about to show you
What do we do?
We bathe in the fire
And sulfur
Purify ourselves
Yeah
And that's where this prophet
Gains the Thadion
That's where that beast comes alive
Yeah
These
Yahoo
Is gonna throw into the pit
And my name is Jeff Rotee
Merkel for nothing
Listen
The stuff that you've heard is BS
What they're describing here is perfect mystery
Right
And you didn't see it the whole time
Why not?
Because they took away your access
They took away your access
They appropriated
They said this texture
This is the Bible here
That's the word God
And it comes from the
Back when Moses was up all the mountain
It comes from the third century
Yeah
Comes from the third century
And originally it's in Greek
Why?
Because the ancient Hebrew has just tiny, tiny
We've been here congregation
We've been here
I don't wanna keep going here
Let them have the Dead Sea Scrolls
But don't let them
Tell you a fairy tale of history
