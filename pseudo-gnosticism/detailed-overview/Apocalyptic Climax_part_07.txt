Go to the text, the next text
Don't tell me I'm scary
I'm coming into your dreams, baby
Give me the next one
Love it, oh, yah
Okay, yah, the impression
I just wanted to see the bottom
We were gonna talk about the phantasm
But I think we need to go on
Yah, I wanted to get into the
Aspects of all of this
When you go into the third heaven with these Christians
That's what you gotta do
Let's get all happy
Let's get all happy
Yah, right
Let's just, okay, party people
Glory, glory
We're gonna give him glory
We're gonna give the king glory
Why? Because what's coming?
Do you know what this is a reference to?
Yah, yah
This is a reference to a
Right that we have
In classical texts that predate
Christianity by hundreds of years
Yes
What is this?
Gamos
It's the gamos
That you call the marriage of the lamb
Which I always thought was a little bit perverted
I was like, what?
Never kind of made sense
Like, here's the bride, isn't she beautiful?
She's been washed and cleansed
Oh, she's
She has been cleansed in blood of her lord
And here she is, and here's the lord
Meh
Wait, what?
Is that thing gonna marry that beautiful bride?
That is disgusting, bro
Who thought of this stuff?
Right?
No, it's because it's mistranslated
Right?
They're talking about that fleece
That holds the song
That causes the
Right of
Death and resurrection
To work
Oh, nice
Nice, you mean
You can use this song to replicate the right
Yes
You can't do it without it
Turns out the song is everything
Fantastic
Fantastic
There is a marriage
Ceremony
That takes place
On
That fleece
Yeah
Yeah, isn't that nice?
Didn't you wonder why there was a marriage thing?
Right? You're like
God and his son and his son's wife
Who else is in that family?
Wait
Father and son
And there's a holy ghost out here too
Right? But still, he's like a cousin or something
Right? Where's the mom?
And
Didn't he have any sisters?
Wow, well, it turns out he does
Turns out a third of them
Ended up
The Mormons will love this
Ended up in the right place
Serving the right king
Why wouldn't you?
We hate liars, dude
Right? Everybody
In the Satanic congregation
For those of you who have taken my Greek course
And I wanted to say
My great courses are coming
Fantastic. I've got some killer students
At all levels
And I'm totally pleased
With that
And I just want to say
What a privilege it is
To be able to work with you in Dojo
To get you up to speed
So that you can get out there
And you can do your own work
And you can forge ahead in the frontier
I just want to say it's great
It's a credit to humanity
And it's a gift
That I am able to work with you
So, thank you
Everyone who's working diligently in the Dojo
Love it. Let's go to the next source
I was going to say a few things
But don't want to get sappy
Let's get all happy
Right? We did that one
Oh, yeah
Notice the woman that's involved in this
Mm-hmm, yeah
Right?
Just wait
There's the lamb. Keep going. We don't need him anymore
Throw him away
Here we go. Oh, yeah, it's a prayer
Don't worry. Give me the next text
We're almost finished, people
We're almost finished. And
What is special about our Lord Jesus Christ?
Besides the fact
In the apocalypse
That he is wearing
Women's lingerie
What is the
What is the special thing about him?
Which, look
If you haven't been there
Right? If somebody wanted to portray
Jesus today
And they wanted to get him
Within the apocalypse
They're going to have to bring him the garb of the
Morningstar, which it says
That he's wearing. Let's take a look
At him. He's got a flocks puros
In his othaumoi
He's got what? Yeah
He's been Christed, you boneheads
Right?
Did we
All arrive late? No, Satanic
Congregation is sitting there and like
Yep, we get it. I see some
Of you make comments in the comments, by the way
And you're like, hey, wake up
Go watch the performers
Don't ask questions like that
That's two seasons ago
Right? I love that
And it's really for you people
That I should be most dedicated
Yeah, it should
I'm sorry if it feels like
Sometime that I'm bringing in
The old
It's because they're always
New people who are going to be watching
And they need to
They need to be welcomed
We're going to sacrifice them later
Yeah
Let's go to the next one
Please, please, before
This gets too sappy
He's got the flocks puros in his eyes
That's why he's there
People are like, wait, what is this?
He's got like laser beams
You know, if he's got like fire
Coming out of his eyes
And you get pictures of this
How are you going to depict this?
Right? How are you going to depict it?
It turns out it's the drugs
And they're just using
Technical terms for his Christing
That's what the Morningstar is
He's been Christed
Right? And he
I'm sorry if I misgender
I should have said she there
Yeah, because remember
Ooh
Right? Hey
Stop showing
Those pictures of those earliest statues
Of Aphrodite
Right? You gotta stop showing those
Pretty soon there's going to be a mob
There's going to be a mob
Of evangelicals whacking off the
Penises that are on all the old
Aphrodite statues
Yeah, well, you know
What? You didn't consider that?
Seriously?
Yeah
And you think you understand Jesus
Who's the Morningstar?
The Morningstar is Venus
Yeah
Welcome to the Julian Library
People
Oh god, I love it
Here we got two more and that's it
Because these people, they have hung in there
I gotta get into that climax and let's go
Look, yeah
All of you who wash
Your clothing
Make it all nice and clean
Right? All of you
You're the ones who have that
Authority
You have that right to be in there
With the tree of life
Yeah
You're the ones
You're the ones, does anybody
Smell Eve
Does anybody smell
Ewa
Does anybody smell her hair?
That's who Zoe is
Right? In our oldest text
Which is the
What you call the Old Testament
Which is the Septuagint
That's what she's called
Her name is Zoe
