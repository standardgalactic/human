Isn't that beautiful? Her name is life
And here she comes in the end
You know, you're gonna have to have her
If you're gonna have that gamos
Because otherwise you're nothing, Jack
You are nothing
Your life is not complete
Isn't that amazing?
And that's what the right
Will teach you
You know how many misogynists were
Orphics?
Zero
Imagine, if you could have a religion
Completely devoid of
Misogyny
Right?
If you could put somebody
Through a process where they could
Be born again
Their mind could be opened
And not be misogynists
Isn't that funny?
One of the things that you cure
When you cure disease
Of the psyche
Is misogyny
Interesting
Interesting. You mean the Greeks
Would say the most diseased
Are those atheist
Christians
Yeah, they would
Those sibling, atheist Christians
They're the ones who bring
That pollution
And let it fester
That's what they would say
Psychically. I mean, take it for what you want
You know, it's a bunch of dead people
Right?
Take that for what you want
They're gonna overthrow
They're gonna overthrow your democracy
Wait, what? Who said that?
Julie and the apostate? Where are you?
He's hiding somewhere in here
I knew he would be
Children, right? We need a children's show
That's what we need
Whoever wants to volunteer to be Barney
Let me know. You come in here
I'll give you. I'm joking
Down, please, please
No
No, give me the last
Give me the second. Good
And I just wanted to end with this
Because we saw at the very beginning
Of this journey
That today
And I'm gonna get to your comments
Because I want to do a little back
And forth with your comments
See how people are doing
Because it's nice. We can do that. It's live
Right?
I want to
Punctuate
This talk tonight by saying
Look, we started with
Somebody saying
Who had access to sources
Saying, look, the history
The historians of the Greeks themselves
Who are writing their own histories
They're saying
That
They as a culture emerged
From
What you and I would call
Trafficking
Trafficking
Yeah
So
Yeah
Think about that for a minute. Love it
Jesus is sitting there
And he says what? Jesus says
Look
Come out against me
Like I'm some kind of trafficker
Like I'm some kind of trafficker
The reality
Is
That you are
Right out of your son of god
Mouth
And you think through the fairy tale
The son of god is the descendant
Holy Jesus
Virgin breath
And they're a little bit
Right? And there it comes
Wait, what?
That's what you think
Because you are a sucker
For fairy tales
You love them
That's not the anthropology, bro
They call them sons of god
Because they were so high
They could conceive
Of things they normally couldn't
They could see things
They could go places
Travel, you hear?
Do you hear them talking like that?
Jesus was the biggest drug user on the planet
Thanks to Jesus
Like I'll let you take this poison
Oh god, it won't kill you
I'll show you, you want the water of life
I'll show you
I'll show you, I got your water of life
It's a sad
I'm sorry for you
Christians out there
Because you haven't been a part
Of this process
I am sorry
That your duping
Was so incredible
But hey
Look at it this way
You can stop now
Right? You can live part of your life
Without
Um
Putting a pedo
Into a position of somebody
That you know is your master
And lord
You can walk away from that
And they recognize that
They recognize that spell
Can be broken, that Christian spell
It's the same thing, it's Taliban
It's the same thing, the Orthodox
Who want that blood
It's the same thing
Those child sacrifices
Yeah
Yeah
Let us pray
Somewhere that is
Outside
Of the capital
And let that
Democracy
Let that democracy thrive
You know who would say that?
Athena
A woman goddess
A woman goddess
For my
20% female audience
Right?
For my 20% female audience
Yeah
Yeah
She was worshiped and we got democracy
Thank you, Athena
Let's look at a couple of comments
And then we're gonna
We're going to
Give you the teddy to roll us out
I love it, the rest of the song is
Awesome
Let's see
There's always time to change the
Here, let's put
No, okay
Sorry, it looks like
No
No, take a trip without leaving
Your seat, yeah, put that up
That's intelligent, is that intelligent?
Take a trip without leaving
Your seat
That guy's a wizard, maybe it's a witch
I don't know
Here, put that one up
Yeah, go ahead
I know it's small, no, not that one
This one
Bingo
I love that
Did somebody win?
What do I get? What's my prize?
Let's go
Do they roll bingo while we're doing
I didn't know the Falcon had space for bingo
I love it though
Keep it out
Look at that one, put Carrie's up there
Here's Carrie Ann Chrysler
Oh, Carrie's been here from the beginning
Right, Carrie, I'm sorry if you pronounce it
Carrie, I don't know
You should tell me
And so what is it?
Yeah, so a chaos
Control, chaos and control
Definitely
Definitely, right
Look at the very way the mystery is set up
It's meant to
Put you into a place
And pull you back out of it
That you can have some kind of
Awakening, a new perspective
On the universe, yeah, that is
That's good stuff, man
Talk about it, it's both chaos and control
We can jump
To Wonderland anytime
Yeah, can you?
Don't be like that
I think, I don't know
It makes me want to go too
I'll go with you, wait
Let's go, but you got to be with Alice
Or I'm totally not interested
Because, you know
Aneus, right, remember Aneus
With the civil ride
I mean
