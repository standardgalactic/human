If you aren't sitting with the muse
What the hell are you doing, right?
Seriously, you thought your life
Would be fulfilled in your husband
Or your wife, or your children
Or your next door neighbors
Pensioned for
Sitting around smoking cigars
No, no
None of that stuff is fulfilling
Right, it is that
Muse alone
Isn't she gorgeous?
Oh god, yeah
Singer of the universe
Love it
Oh, you didn't know the universe
Was being sung?
Oh, man
I should have cheered
Did I leave that out?
I left that out
The universe
As you experience it
Is a song
Yeah, with a singer
Love it
Love it, what else is life?
What else can be?
Love the Gandhi
Okay, so you think
They'll overthrow democracy again
Or is that yahoo going to be castrated?
Who is
Serpent spit?
That's fantastic
Great question
Is yahoo going to get castrated?
Yeah
Yeah
If
Athena
Can be born
From yahoo's brain
We can preserve democracy
But
It doesn't look good
When your
Justice
Is no longer there
Right, first thing you gotta do
Is you gotta have justice
Let the sacrifices, right
You're allowed
To sacrifice the tyrant
Who attempts to overthrow the government
That's historical
That's part of our American
Spirit
I feel like Thomas Jefferson
Baby
Let's get it on
Right
Oh, God
What did Ben say?
He said something about any religion
That had to be
Yoke itself to the government
Was not one worth following
It's a virus
It's a virus
And it'll kill your democracy
This isn't the first time
Right
Yeah, fantastic
It's dangerous, so on behalf of
Athena, why do I say that?
People say, oh, I don't care
About your politics, shut up
I don't care about your politics
This isn't politics
This is the worship of the gods
And I'm pretty darn thankful
That I've got
A democracy
I'm pretty thankful of the enlightenment
That that has been able
To foster
And I know
When I face my ancestors
There's gonna be questions
That I fight to preserve
What they created
For us
By Athena, man
I wanna be sitting there with her
Right, I wanna be on that side
So
What's the future?
What's the future?
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Love it, who said this one?
Wait, okay
I, for one, am glad I don't
Gotta worry about stealing my kids
And selling them into sex trafficking
Thanks, Christianity
Yes, no
It's a good thing
Who would want to do that anyway, right?
That's what all those songs
Of mourning are about
That's what all those songs
Of mourning are about
Because it's the parents
Who have lost their children
Because the band
The band of traffickers
Came up and took them
It's terrible
Terrible, don't think
I was talking with somebody about Jesus
And the fact that
Loving Jesus
Is, you know
People can do it and
Don't worry, it's not bad
Dude, you're loving a pedophile
Jesus Christ
Is a drug-using
Child-abusing
Pito
Who had a band
Of prostitute boys
And if you knew
What he did with them
Through that little window that we have
Of seeing him arrested
By the way
You don't have any evidence
Mark
1451 and 52
Sorry, satanic congregation
Already has that stuff memorized
They don't need that
Look it up, I feel like you guys know
Look it up, okay
Go to the next one, let's see
Put that one up there
I agree, he, he, he
Was that a gender thing
Or was that a
I'm just kidding
I say fantastic
What are you doing
What is that, I say fantastic
Fantastic, love it
No
What's that
This is a kind of comment
People need to send
This kind of comment more often
Seriously, right
Oh, oh, Dr.
Yes
Does this sound like
Oh
Um
No
Down
You
Fierce, it's just the mojo
It'll go away in a minute
I'm reaching out to you
Remember how the preachers
Reach out to you like
I'm reaching out to you
Oh, I can feel it, can you feel it
Oh, put that thing up there
That abomination
Yeah
Put that, hang on
Hang on, give me a second
Oh
Yes, no, pretend like you didn't see that
You go, oh, just
Flash it quick so they have to stop it and bring it back
No, take it down, okay
What was that
That didn't get my goat, did it
Bring her up and then
We're gonna head out for the evening
Look, bring her up, where'd she go
Bring her up, fantastic
Look, oh god
Curse on thee
Curse on thee
Very fact that you look there
Very bad
Okay
Thank you, Apollo
Who is Pan
Thank you very much, if you
Read that hymn, you'll find that
Yeah, yeah
Oh, love it
Love it, thank you for coming tonight
Thank you for coming
Everybody out there
I love you, man, I love you
It's just fantastic to
Be able to spend this time with you
And to be able to commune like this
I truly am thankful
And we'll meet up, we'll meet up
On the other side
And we'll have more time
We'll have more time together, I love it
I'm gonna play you out tonight
With a little more Teddy
Who is our Orpheus
Hail Satan
See you next time
It's elusive
Hail Satan
It's in the air tonight
But so long
St. Peter's Palm
So carry on
For those who have eyes to see
Aphrodisia
St. Peter's Palm
