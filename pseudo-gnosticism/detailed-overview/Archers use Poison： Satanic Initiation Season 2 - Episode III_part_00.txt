Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace? Where is that whore called Destiny?
I think she ran on without me
Welcome back, we have a great night tonight
I'm going to take you guys somewhere that nobody else is ever going to take you
Yeah, I'm going to take you into the heart of ancient Roman medicine
We're going to look in the drawer of Claudius, the emperor
We're going to pull out an actual scene
I'm going to show you what happens when you take the drug of communion and you enter the mystery
We're going to begin tonight with a guy named Scribonius Largus
We're going to find him, we're going to pull him from the grave
We're going to talk to him and see what he says in his own words
We're going to see what he says about these cults that you and I have been looking at
We're going to look at the Saturnian Toxicum
What is the Saturnian Toxicum?
Let's pull that down
I want to first explain to you that we're looking at
What I'm going to show you tonight is Latin, first of all
We're not going to look at Greek, we're going to look at Latin
We're going to look a little bit of Greek
But we're going to look at the Roman side through the physician who was connected to the legions
And may or may have not been a chief physician to Claudius
But he was certainly from what he talks about, he was certainly involved with military medicine
Fantastic
Personally he preserved for us a work called the Compositione
Which is prescription after prescription after prescription for different types of compound drugs
He doesn't talk, he's not big on theory, he's big on practice and what works in treatment
What we can do with all sorts of injuries
For today we have the example of the Aeropoison
And I want to just take you there to begin with
Let's go to Scribonius here
And I want you to take a look at this passage at the bottom
You notice the very first word is Toxicum
So this is a very specific drug compound that he's about to tell us about
And that is not a native Latin word
When you see that Xe you're going to know that you're taking a loan word from the Greek
And the Greek is Toxicum, can we bring up Toxicum please?
The top, good
And if you just take a quick look at this definition
You'll notice right away over for the bow
Wait a minute, I thought you were talking about drugs here
I am, just wait, we'll get there
You talk about a kind of Cretan reed, right?
The Calamus
The toxic Calamus is a kind of Cretan reed that was used for arrows
Arrows, we're talking bow culture with this word right?
And if you look down Roman numeral number two
A person skilled in the use of the bow
Here we have a bow culture right?
I bet they got horses too
But I want you to look at Roman numeral number three
Notice the bowmen, the Tuxotai
Those bowmen are there
But then under number two we have Toxicum pharmacone
A poison for smearing arrows with
Yes, and you see at the very bottom it's the equivalence of the Wenanum
He's saying here it's a toxin, it's a drug
Fantastic, so let's go back to the text that we've got from Scribonius
I just want you to notice a couple of words
And then I'm going to show you a video
But I want you to notice Toxicum
And when somebody gets a hold of this stuff
Whether they're drinking it, he says
Or whether it's inflicted from an injury
It's the same response that the person has
And what is this terrible, terrible reaction?
Right away
This is terrible pain in the guts
All of the guts
All over the guts, terrible pain
Like someone threw a javelin through you
Yeah, and it creates a furorementis
It creates a crazed state of mind
A fury, not just any sort of craze
But a fury
