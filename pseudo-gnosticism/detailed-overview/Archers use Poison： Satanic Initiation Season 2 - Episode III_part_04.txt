I want to read you a little passage
From Valerius Flakis now
To bring us all to a place where we're at the same spot
This guy, Coastes
Who comes from the west
To the east to see Medea
In performing what she became so well known for
That we can't even translate properly
So tonight we looked at somebody
Entering a bachic phase
With these drugs
We saw them entering this hilarity
Head back saying the things
That Skrobonius says are hard to be interpreted
What they say
So now I want to go to this
Late Bronze Age
Worker of sorcery, Coastes
That we see in Valerius Flakis' Argonautica
His story about the Medwa
He says, mightiest among them
In Stygian Arts
Coastes comes
He's the mightiest
What is the Stygian?
In the what?
The Stygian Arts
Yeah
Those are the underworld arts
Yeah, those are the arts
That make us all afraid
At night when we have our nightmares
Those are the arts that are doing it
These are the necromancers
Necromancers
Anyway
Not love of war excites him
But the fame of the Scythian-made
Medea breathing poisons
In match to his own
That's the translation
Who is this?
I'm going to give you the Mosley
This is the Mosley translation
But in the line that he translates
Poisons equal to yours
Is the difficulty
There's a difficulty with the Greeks
Just a terrible, I mean with the Latin
Just a terrible, terrible difficulty
And I will
I will read it to you in Latin
And translate it literally
So
The love of war
The love of Mars does not move him
Love of Mars, don't you love that?
Now you know why the fleece
Which the garden
Which the dragon guards
Is hanging in the grove of Mars
It's important that you understand that
Image-wise, it's important that you understand
Put yourself in that place
In the grove of Mars
Yes, so not the love of Mars
Sed fama catai virginis
But the Scythian virgin
Medea
Yeah
Yeah, doing what?
Spirans, what draws him?
Her? Spirans
Breathing
Inhaling
Paribus
