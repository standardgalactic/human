Wenanis
Balanced
Drugs, poisons
Inhaling them
Yeah, now we call this
And we see this on the medical side
This breathing of the
Of the drug
And remember these drugs that they're using
They're not all things that they aerosolize, right?
These are not all fumigations that they're performing
There's a lot of incense involved
And there's a lot of exposure to that incense
But a lot of these that are administered
Rectally, orally, ocular-wise
And slits in the skin
A lot of these drugs are
Not kinds that you would use in fumigations
So what exactly it's meaning
History, what is it meaning
When it says he was so impressed
This necromancer, right?
Now that he's gone, the text says
Now that he left his homeland to come see this
To come see the Medwa
Perform this act
He, the people can sleep
Safely and soundly
Because he's no longer drawing down the moon
Yeah
He's no longer drawing down the moon
So he is with her now
In order to see her breathe
In these equal
These balanced poisons
Yeah
And that word for breathing is
Associated in antiquity with the Romans
With the inspiration
The breath of inspiration
Right? She is a Wirago
We just read about a Wirago last time, correct?
We saw that Eve, the one who cries Ewa
She is the Wirago
We saw that's how they described her as the Wirago
We are squarely with Roman Minerva
Squarely with her
And it is she that gets us to that place
By worship of the muses
By worship of the muses
She gets us to that place
And her breathing
Her breathing is through
Equally balanced drugs
Equally balanced poisons
She's oftentimes said
Seneca claims that she has a compound
Created from different
Venoms, snake-venoms
And in her very authentic incantation
She invokes Ophiuchus
So we are seeing now
You see in the tradition of the epics
In the poetic traditions
You see Medea's medicine emerging
But you can see the very same medicine
In the text of the imperial doctors
Of the highest ranking imperial doctors
And in the doctors who serve people like Nero
So we are one step closer to completing the scene
Completing that crime scene
Our concern and people have been talking about this
Our concern is to bring back Lady Babylon
That's the mission, right?
To understand that reality
To see and to have eyes to see and ears to hear
