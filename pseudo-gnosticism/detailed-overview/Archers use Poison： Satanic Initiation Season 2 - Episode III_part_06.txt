To not follow a fairy tale
But to worship reason and honor reason
So we want to bring back that image
We are stuck here at this scene with Jesus
Jesus Christ arrested in a public park
Slash cemetery at early morning hours
With a naked boy
And what is he doing there?
Under those circumstances
We are beginning to be able to see at least a history
Of where these drug rights come from
And to see that they are entrenched
Within very high levels of ancient society
There is a reason that the Bacchic suppression
Of 186 or 185, whatever it is
That that was a reaction to this cult
Operating within the highest levels of the aristocracy
We're told that it was the women that were getting rounded up
And it said they were arresting the wives of senators
Who were involved
And how did they know that they were involved in the conspiracy?
Because of the drugs?
Yeah, because of the drugs, that's how they identified them
Isn't it interesting to know that if it was a conspiracy
As the Romans viewed it as a conspiracy
Not just the free expression of religion
But we're talking when religion and political power
Are the same thing
Yes, you see the Bacchins today
When we say, when the Romans say yes it was a conspiracy
Because they were trying to take power
We need to consider then that this is really
This is no longer fairy tale world
This is a very human place that we've come to
And we need to consider these sources
If I were to tell you some of the secrets that are in these things
That you might start getting paranoid
About uncovering even further what is behind the facade
Were women staying at home?
All of these drug traditions come from female practice
The oldest ones that we have come from the gynecology and obstetrics
So somebody out there right now is talking about the use of aero poisons
Until that's great, congratulations
It used to be that people would openly deny
Scholars would openly deny, no they didn't use drugs
There's no drugs involved
I just read you an entire drug passage about antidotes to a drug that gets you so high
You babble and blurt and wiggle your tongue like you've just been decapitated
And we just discussed the antidotes used to bring those people back from that edge
So were they using drugs?
Wake up, wake up and smell the opium
But that's old, it used to be you had to fight against that
People would say no, no they didn't use drugs
Because they don't want to look at their history in the context of people using drugs
Can we really say Augustus who brought the poxromana that he was an opium swiller?
Yeah we can, yeah we can
Scrobotius says so, yes, but we don't want to say those kind of things
Now we're at the step, now we're at the step where we know this is the renaissance
This is the renaissance of the psychedelics
This is the toxic step forward that's always necessary in order to initiate the spark
In order to start the spark, the apocalypse that brings that return
It's a cyclical mystery, right? Death and rebirth
So I wanted you tonight to see that there is a tradition that has left behind evidence
Good strong linguistic evidence
First hand testimony, you get Scrobotius up in trial, up in the stand
There's nothing better, right out of their mouths, you can't deny it
It's right out of their mouths
So if we are at that point that we are determining what that crime scene involves with Jesus
Now we know, we know that the drug side of things goes way back
And is heavily influential in the contemporary time, in his century when he is
Scrobotius is the early first century, right? He's exact contemporary with Jesus
He probably died within a few years, not a few years
But shortly after Jesus died, to complete contemporary
And we have in that contemporary, we have the use of these drugs
For the sake of entering into a state of mystery communion
The process of being born again
