Come and get it
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave
On the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a storm
Coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed
All the way
Why did you ever change your name?
All the way
Why did you ever change your name?
Welcome back to the Lady Babylon Wednesday Night Bible Studies
Seventh and final season
Tonight we're going to take a look
At a mystery that you have not
Had revealed
Tonight we're going to look to peer
With the most blessed eyes
Into the most holy territory
We're going to see within that space
And you know you couldn't get it elsewhere
Because nobody reads the text anymore
Right fantastic we're going to see through tonight
We're going to see through the deception
We're going to see into the language
We're going to see all the fairy tale
Evaporate tonight on Lady Babylon
Tonight I want to just jump right in head first
What we need to do is get you the material
This is more like a scoop than anything else
But we need to get you the material
We need to show you tonight
I want you to thank to yourself associates
Tonight we're going to look at the associates of Jesus Christ
We're going to see Jesus Christ and his associates
This terribly terribly important relationship
That follows him all the way to his trial
If you can call it that
Before his execution
That relationship with his members
That's what's really an issue
It's what he's doing
It's what his members are doing
And his relationship to them
Are you ready to see some disciples?
Are you ready to see some of his associates?
Let's take you right there
I want to open up with just this
I want to set the space as we get out of the spaceship
We step into this time
Smell the air
Feel the Greek
What place are we going to?
Where does Jesus like to go?
Like to go
Where does Jesus like to go?
He likes to go to the paradise baby
Doesn't everybody like to go to paradise?
This place smells great
It's a vineyard
It's a cultivation
And we're going to go there
Why? Why?
This place that's always always
Teaming with life
Why does Jesus go there?
Let's go to the next one
Fantastic
You hear the blessed music stop
And then the cue, the villain music
There's this dude, Judas
He knows that place
