people screaming, kill him, kill him. Do you want this other guy? No, kill him.
Yeah. Yeah, I'm not a lace. How many time are we gonna have to have lace
stays associated with Jesus and his boys? Now it's gonna get creepy. I'm gonna
show you the mystery that hasn't been revealed. Fantastic. Fantastic. Thank you
for being so patient. You mean I had to wait through seven seasons of this guy?
Oh my god. Where's that whip? This is one for me. This is one for me. It took you
seven seasons. I don't know if that hurts or not. Purgative, right? We get it
out. We get it out. All right, let's go back to the next text and see. Let's
see that. Oh my god. What does she say about Peter? Remember the girl that's
watching the door? She's like, no, no, no, this dude. This dude's one of them. Right?
Excuse me, sir. Right? He's like, oh, don't look at me. I'm not in this. I got no
business. Right? And now she says, now you're that, you know, aren't you that
diachtoros of the Christ? What is the diachtoros? It is a Christos, his
position in a diachtor, diachtoros. That is the somebody who, well, you could say
it's a minister. You could say it's an assistant. You say it's the person
through whom you run the operation. Right? Now you know who Peter is. Now you
know why we make fishers of men. And now you know why he had to be the rock with
the key. Yeah. You remember Anna and I since the fire of those, those bumpkins?
He was like, you didn't give us everything. Nope. Nope. They didn't. We know it. And
they ended up dead. Shh. Don't tell anyone. Christians love that story.
Yeah. That's the rock, baby. That punk was hip. He knew how to drive an
organization. He was the rock. And in addition to him, the sons of thunder,
right? We had the sons of thunder there. If you don't have sons of thunder,
you're, you're in bad trouble. And guess what? That is not any sort of
veramac or Hebrew expression. It is not. It is not. It is a Greek expression.
It's a Greek call expression within the mystery. So, you know, enjoy. Let's go.
Look, people, we're going to enjoy this. I'm going to start enjoying. Bring me up
the next one, because this is, we are almost done. We are almost done. What is
that? The octopus, right? That minister, that servant, right? Who administers
what's going on? Who is that the actor? Who is, who is Hermes? Who is that one
who facilitates the kingdom of God, if you're on in the Greek mind? Hermes.
Hermes, the one who is the thief. Ladies and gentlemen, I introduce you to Hermes,
the thief. Yeah. Okay. Don't get scared. Don't get scared. These, the, these,
the epithets, these, the expressions that we're using to bring this cult's
business. Okay. Let's go back. Next one. Boom. Yeah. And Jesus said, look, look,
brah. Remember, he's getting questioned and he's pissed. He's pissed and he's
speaking up. No fear. He says, look brah. My kingdom. It's not of this cosmos.
And when he says cosmos, he doesn't mean universe. They're talking organization.
The organization that you see around yourself is not mine. He says, if it were,
if it were, my Hupertai would kick your back sides.
Go to the next one. And would you say, what is the Hupertai? Oh, who are these people?
They're underling servants, attendants. Okay. People at arms. Okay. Okay. Good. Good. So Jesus
has associates. He has associates. And if this was his cosmos that we were messing with,
those associates would fight, but they don't. They don't go down. Sounds like more threatening to
me than it to you. It sounds like one of those body cameras. You know what I mean? Have you been,
ma'am? Have you been drinking? Yeah. Okay. Come on. You got to do some. Look what he says. Here's
what known us makes of those words. This is the impression from antiquity. This is not our
modern impression. It's known as his impression. And what does he say? He says the same thing.
He says, it's not our kingdom, baby. It's not our kingdom, but if it were, my Dresteres would
take up arms. What are Dresteres? What are Dresteres? What is a Drester? It's a laborer.
A working man. Oh, look, there's a feminine form. Drestera. A work woman. Okay. Fine. Oh,
oh, people don't look. Hold your eyes. It's coming. Look at didrasco. A runaway
a lacedace. A lacedace. Do you know what these workmen do? They're runaway children.
He's got his favorite. He's got his favorite. Let's go on the boat with Jesus. Are you ready?
You didn't let, you love Jesus. I know some of you love him. I know you love Jesus. You want to
go on his boat now? You perverts. Yeah. Cross everywhere you see the cross, where we see the
cross most. Gets my goat. Every time, leave the goat. Every time you see this image, I want you to
know. I want you to know that it is the product of a company that started on a boat with some kids
doing lacedic trafficking. Yeah. Yeah. Do you know how? Go ahead, take, goodbye, Penelope.
Do you know how that one of the kids gets in? It says, bring up the text. I think it's the next
one. Maybe it's the next one. Boom. One of the kids is there. That's there at the, just, yeah, there
we go. Oh, yeah. No. Who is it? Who is it we're talking about? Right? Look at the word here in
the middle. Lacede. Oh, God. Doesn't that, let's just freeze that for a minute. Doesn't that look
gorgeous? Lacede. Oh, yeah. You know what that is? That's the archaic form. That's the archaic form.
The form that you're seeing from the Bible is, you know, later, much later. This is kind of the
earlier form. And what is this Lacede doing? He's talking about Barabbas, right? He's talking about
Barabbas and what kind of dude that he is. He was one of the enforcers. He's one of what they call,
are you ready? This is a cult slash gang title. Cult slash gang title. Remember the bucket cult
is gang, right? And what are they, they have titles and what's the title here for this guy?
He's the deathbringer. When you need something done, you get the deathbringer, right? They were
going to put him to death, but they chose not to in order to put Jesus to death because he
presented something that was a higher target. Yeah. He outranked him, right? This is serious stuff,
dude. This is serious stuff. You heard him talking to him. They were talking to him, right? Oh,
