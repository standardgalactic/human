wait a minute, I don't see her crying anywhere. No, no, no. It's not talking about crying.
It's not talking about crying. There was the one incident with the feet.
But it's not talking about crying. All right. She didn't get that label because she did something.
This is a cult title. Do you know who takes care of the tears?
What are the tears? Bring me the, what is this? Still working, still working. Bring me the, bring
me the, uh, yeah, the definition. Dachro and tears. Look, look, look, people. Look, look, look.
Number two, that which drops like tears, gum or sap. You talk about that. Tear of the acacia.
Tear of the acacia. Do you want to know what Mary Magdalene's love of tears was all about? It's
the reason that Jesus could be given such an expensive enema. Yeah. Which Judas was not happy
about. Remember, that's part of the deal. Peter's like, Hey, I'm not in the business. Now you understand
why Jesus never gets caught with money. You were like, wait a minute. He's the son of God.
He loves everything. He don't need no money.
No, dude. He was running an operation. Right. He's not that man that was Judas.
Right. Who keeps the boys going? Who keeps the boys going? Pirates. Pirates love it. Let's go back
to that last one that we were at. Um, yep, that one. Okay. And here she is. She's the lover of
tears next. Yep. To that one. Good. Here's, I want to pull John 1925. It's all going to make
sense, people. There was standing there. I'm translating. There was standing there at the
base of the cross, the mother of Jesus and the sister of his mother. Okay. Stop right there.
There's no conjunction now. This is not listing more people. It goes on to say to Mary's.
One of them of the clops, the other one, the Magdal.
Huh. And if you remember, known as pointed out very, very specifically just now,
this is not in Hebrew. This is in those languages that are filtering down
from the Caucasus, from around the Black Sea down into what you and I call Syria and all the
way over to Babylon. You wonder why Medea, say the Greeks ruled Babylon. All right.
It's the Caucasus. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Wait a minute. I feel like I'm waking up from a long
fairy tale dream. It's wonderful. I love it. Okay. Let's keep going. Um, that back to John.
Where's John? Get over here, John. You naughty. Get over here. Okay. Now more of that. Here we go.
They're standing there at the crime. And what now, now look, it says there's,
there's two women standing there. Right. Mystery. I told you I was going to show you a mystery. Hang
on. Um, one's his mother and one's the sister of his mother. Now there's no conjunction here to tell
you and there's more people. Instead, what we have is the description of those two women.
One Maria of clubs and the other Maria, the Magdal.
There's a, for those of you who are into the esoteric and into the codes, go ahead and take
it down to you. I'll give you a special little throw your bone tonight. Look in the 17th century
before a linguist to tell you that the Magdal is the translation of Magus from Scythian.
It's the way the Scythians expressed Maga, the great witch queen, the one who knows all the drugs
and all the songs and the way to new life and resurrection, the Christ, she who has been
Christ. Okay. That is what Magdal is. These two Marys are not for Marys.
Marys, the mother of Christ is the bride of the clops. You say what? The thief. It's not a name.
Cleopas is a name. Clops isn't cloppa. No. It's the son. Who is this? Who is this thief? Who is this
thief? Yeah. Do you ever wonder why Jesus was taken titles reserved for Hermes? Did you ever wonder?
He's the son of God. You morons. He's the son of God. Not Satanic congregation. I wasn't talking
to you. You guys are morons. It's the people who perpetuate the fantasy. Those are the morons.
None of this impacts them. This radiation that we're feeling, none of this impacts them.
Why did they have to close the canon? Why did they have to establish an orthodoxy?
They had to pair all of the connections that were there to the lactic cult sex rights.
Yeah. Pair that stuff down. Take it off. That's not. We don't accept that. That's not. No. I'm
showing you the thoughts of a Greek who is saying what all of this organization is about.
Let's go. Let's go. I love it. People, thank you for your time. Thank you for your time. It's been
such a nice seven seasons. Yeah. So, here is what, here is what knownness does. Here is what knownness
does with that introduction to John and to the two women. And I'm just going to tell you.
He says, does he support these two women? Does he talk? Oh, my God. Does he? Here comes the mystery.
Are you ready? So, standing there next to the cross, you know, where the people that were gathered,
there is a Tyroid. There's companions. And Maria, right? And Mary, who was the God producer of the
Christ, who was that one, right? Who produced that divine offspring. Okay. And along with these,
the next line says, oh, at the end of the second line. And along with these was this relative,
this relative. And she was a homonymous Maria. She was also called Maria. She had the same name.
That's what homonymous means, right? And what? And she was herself, Mary Magdalene,
the lover of tears, the lover of tears. Now, I'm going to finish it off and I want you to listen.
Please listen carefully. Take it down for one second. Please listen carefully because in this
text is the key to the organization. It reveals to you those who are working the mystery, who are
actually performing it. Are you ready? Are you ready? You don't think you'd have Jesus without,
Jesus Christ without the mystery, did you? Right? Son of God, from the 12-year-old virgin that was
in the temple, right? Right? With whose fingers, the fingers of the midwife were burned because of
what was inside of her. Yeah. On her palpitation. Yeah. Okay. Are you ready? Let's go. Let's go right
to it. What's this last section? So, Christ saw the one who bore and the divine child,
even the one he really loved. Yeah. This divine child. You mean John is a divine child? According
to notice he is. And he says, what does Jesus do, bottom line? He says to his mother, he says this
expression, this, you know, he gives her this little thing to do. He says, hey, lady, right? You who love
the virgins, mother who loves the virgins, and what's he say? Oh my God, bring it down. Ready?
Ready? Look at your virgin son, your Parthenos. You say what? Remember, we're talking associates.
Look at your Parthenos. Yeah. And then he turns to this, to the kid, his student, right? Who's
standing there with them? And he says, hey, check out your mothers, my precious virgin-loving virgin boy.
