Oh, seriously? Now, wait a minute. Check out your mothers. There is a duel in the accusative,
in this sentence. Those two women who are there, those two women are active in the mystery. Those
two women are the ones who are creating the sons of God. And of course they are. One of them is the
Maga. The other one is the bride of God. This is classical Bronze Age mystery. And Jesus Christ
is wrapped up right in the middle. And if it weren't for those Magi who came, speaking their
Assyrian or Syrian terms, Jesus would never be where he is now. Yeah. His entire life is a controlled
setup. Yeah. Yeah. You got to be born into it. Think of it as privileged people. You got to be
born into it. And Jesus was born into it at the top. At the top. Yeah. It's quite a market. Quite a
market, isn't it? Okay. Go back. We're finishing off. Yep. Go to that one. And he says, hey,
he says, you know, take her. Anyway, it goes on for a second and say, you know, he took, he ended
up following Jesus' instructions. But then it says at the bottom, this is known as, again, it says,
and this kid is Osporos. He's an Osporos. He's an unceded son. Wait, Osporos? Yeah. He's an unceded
son. This blessed godchild. We're talking about John. We're talking about John. This kid is not
going to be a breeder. Yeah. This kid is not going to be a breeder. He is a person who has been brought
to the world without the birthing. Wait, what? He is one who has not. His mother did not enter
into the pain. Wait a minute. I thought God kicked Eve out so she would have the pain of childbirth.
Yes. Because it's a drug. It's a compound. When I say drug, not a single drug, but a compound.
And it allows you to enter into that state to produce the God child. And that state is a state
of painlessness. It's revolutionary. Let somebody pick that up for obstetrics and gynecology. Did you
know it's better to put your patient into a state where they are completely relaxed and where they
are not feeling pain while they're delivering? Yeah. And you put them into this, not quite before
coma. It's a little bit before coma, before that, right? You pull them out. You put them into this
kind of slumber. It's not really asleep, but you put them into this painless state. And from that,
they bring out the child. They bring that God child. Where do you think they're getting the drugs
for this? It's what the Magdal does. What do you think that Magda does? That's her. You say,
wait a minute. I told you, the Greek used a dual, a dual for those two and their roles.
Interesting. Okay. Let's go to the next one.
Yeah. I think we skipped one there. There was one in there, people, before we,
before we get to this, well, let's just do this quick. Thio Pius. Look, child of the gods. Who is
a child of the gods? Eros, baby. Eros, right? Do you understand why Eros is pictured as a child now?
Do you understand why Hermes is? Do you understand why it is that Mary, she who produces that God,
must be the bride of Hermes? You, right? You've got to be the Pantocrator, baby.
That's all there is to it. And he's like, what? I don't know what that means.
Don't worry. We'll show you. Go to the next one, please. Yes. And yeah, here's the clopea, right?
Look, what is a clopea? It's a theft, right? But it's also the name of a dance. That's cool.
Why? Because, you know, we have a god of thieves. We have a god of thieves.
Always pictured as a boy. Always pictured as a boy. This is Peter, baby. This is Peter. Who
shows up when Cersei's about to poison and rape Odysseus and all of his men? Right? Who shows up?
A boy. It's the boy Hermes who shows up. The boy Hermes.
Hmm. Is this why you have a title that is the Assyrian or Chaldean form of the God
who brings us this magic? Yeah. It is. It is. Thank you. Thank you, Maria, for caring.
For caring that child. Thank you. Fantastic. It's good. It's gorgeous. Go to the, yep.
This is just somebody. This is what he is. Look, born not a natural way. No way, baby.
Right? This is not normal. You don't get god children normal. Yeah. It's just the way that
they do things in antiquity. Now, you're asking yourself, okay, take this last element to complete
the mystery. Are you ready? Take this last element. Tonight I said we're dealing with
associates of Jesus. Associates of Jesus. Are you ready? Open your eyes to the associates.
Open your eyes. Who is this virgin boy? Who's this virgin boy? Hit it, Chewie.
Revelation 14, 4. Yeah. These are the ones who did not pollute themselves with women.
These are the virgins. And they follow the lamb. Wherever he leads, these were purchased from human
markets. And they became, what did they became? Very most ripe, most beautiful. That thing which
you pick first when you see that apple on the tree. And it's got, take it down. It's got so,
so juicy and round. And it's, oh, it's just, it's just glowing. And you're, oh, you know, you know
you're going to eat that thing. Right? It's not those ones that, those other ones aren't ready yet.
No, let them grow there, right? That one that's ripe. Oh God, it's going to be so sweet. That ripeness,
that's an offering to God and to the lamb. These virgins have been purchased.
Yeah. From the market. Do you hear the lace days talking? Do you hear the lace days? These are the
choice prime cuts. Now the modern Jehovah witnesses will say, we're the virgins.
We're the virgins. Let me show you Jehovah's witnesses who you are. You're sex slaves.
You're sex slaves. You aren't who you think. You, you, you bought into a fairytale.
You bought into Jehovah's witnesses fairytale. Yeah. These virgins, how's the offering? And your
God, man is a creepy pirate involved in child sex trafficking. Yeah. You want to, you want to
continue next time you go, you hear this next time you show up to a temple, next time you show up to
a church, next time you show up to a synagogue, next time you show up to a mosque. Remember,
the guy who's in the middle, the guy who's in your good book
is creep. And for the rest of this season, this final season, we begin the trial
of Jesus Christ. Thank you for coming tonight. You've seen the mystery activated. Hail Satan.
Hey, why did you ever change your name?
Why did you ever change your name?
You
