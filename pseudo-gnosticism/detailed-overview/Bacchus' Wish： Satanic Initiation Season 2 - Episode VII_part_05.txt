Tom also said that the greatest threat to the fledgling American democracy
was the Presbyterians. I'm sure it you know you had to be back then to really to
us that wouldn't be really mean the same thing but this revival that is
happening is a part of history it's a cycle and what you're going to see is
it's effervescence it's going to grow it started and it's going to grow to a
point to a point that it spills over and must bring the destruction of what is
contrary to it around it it breaks out it's a power that breaks out I just want
to I want to quote to you just a little bit of lycophan to take us now to the
prophetic side and I'm going to pull out who somebody called the Camarion
Sibyl somebody called the Camarion Sibyl yeah and I want you to know that the
Camarion Sibyl talked about the dipsass the thirst that is induced and that she
said the darkness you may this may sound familiar the sun would become
darkened the word is shaded full of the as if it's creeping up and pulling out
its power that is from the Camarion Sibyl via via lycophan she also this
the within these prophecies we have for example Athens right and we have the the
telling of the war between Athens and Persia yes specifically Xerxes yep and
we have that preserved within it so we have these ancient prophecies remember
the early Christians were called Sibylists for a reason right so we are we
seeing a return of that yes we are seeing a return of the reactivation of
the mystery yeah and it's happening as we speak and will have an effect will
have an effect so I want to say a quick appreciation I also brought some of the
candor that I wanted to talk about because he uses that you know go to the
priests that use the terminology of the mysteries and you can see what's really
happening fantastic and again the Scott the modern-day scholars they're just
like you ask them about a mystery and they're like that's why the word mystery
is there and next time they do you stop them and you say look you cannot take me
in the back alley today right you can't so that's why I had that I had that
priests waiting for you but I just want to say it's been an outstanding an
outstanding season and from the productive nature of what you have been
bringing forward and all of the groups that have been active at the you know
the individuals very intelligent driven individuals who have stepped forward and
who have made this interaction so worthwhile to me with your great
feedback I'm looking at your visions yeah I'm looking at your visions for the
secretive group it's on the inside that nobody knows about yeah keep up the
work keep up the work because we have to refuse to become this right we're not
going that way we're going reason and if the if the proper resolution of that
that we saw tonight if the proper resolution is the antidote then
shouldn't we be seeking the antidote yeah definitely definitely it's been a
privilege and an honor to serve with you I will have one Bible study on Wednesday
and then I will take a week and recoup which means I will spend time pulling up
the sources that I believe would be most desired by you at that time right the
real I mean come on people you you don't need to keep coming back unless
there's real good stuff unless I can pull out the good stuff right I mean are
you in there yeah I've got to pull out the good stuff and I've got to bring that
to you and now that we have figured out how to navigate this ship and how to be
able to get into those positions where we can see what they're doing in
antiquity now it's time to say hey we need to we need to dig in and we need
to go the places that you know people are not gonna naturally be drawn to we
got we got to go to those dark places and we're gonna work with them I have
enjoyed myself tremendously this this time guys thank you so much we've got a
couple of people looks like oh snappy snappy welcome snappy we need
introduction music for snappy snappy you saw the you saw the people tonight
gathered together in that assembly and you saw them perform an action that can
only be described as ecstatic right that was I was pure ecstasy whether they
were in the Capitol or whether they were in that church tell me how does that
make you feel from your perspective and tell us you know were you there have
you been in that you know how's it make you feel it makes me disgusted to be
honest because it's very clear that these people have an agenda and anyone
who's intimate or familiar with the church knows what that agenda is it's
agenda of genocide it's agenda of control and you saw how they were are they
were raising their arms up there they're drawing down that spirit right of Christ
they're becoming possessed they're becoming frenzy they're trying to block
out all reason all thought so that they can just focus on this mission this
Christian national insanity and it blows my mind you know yeah and you know if
you watch they've got a live feed they've got a live feed I highly recommend
that people tune into the live feed of what's going on in Kentucky right now and
what direction of people they have they sing of kingdom and they sing of power
on earth and they sing of with trumpets they have their horns that burn they're
