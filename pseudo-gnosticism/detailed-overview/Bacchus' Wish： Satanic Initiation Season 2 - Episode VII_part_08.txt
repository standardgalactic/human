originated here maybe it's a we didn't have mass protests so like in my in my
home city we had Ottawa we had over a month and a half of a trucker protest
where they blocked the entire downtown core they occupied the city which is the
capital city they didn't they couldn't make it to Parliament and but they like
wouldn't stop blaring their horn horns they were defecating in the streets
people were waving Confederate flags in Canada people were wearing them wait
wait wait wait wait wait let me see I wait I had yeah I had seen a report on
that I had did not know that they were waving American Confederate flags yeah
there was at least one that was documented for sure and that person
repented and said well I just thought the flag meant freedom and I'm a
libertarian whatever we all know but there was also Nazi flags and there was
also stars of David that said saw vaccine which means like no vaccines
because they were envisioning themselves as the Jews being persecuted by the
government because the government was saying they had to get at least one
mandatory vaccine wait a minute so in Canada then the extreme religious Jews
and Christians you call them evangelicals yeah these people weren't
Jewish these were all evangelical all crazy people they were just adopting
Jewish symbolism Hitlerian symbolism to show how persecuted they are they have
this ridiculous persecution point complex about how masks and social
distancing and all of this stuff is some kind of insane oppression and how they
need to overthrow the government and like like literally I worked downtown at
a like an occult kind of shop in the byword market during the summer and I
would watch them walk into the byword market which is like an open-air like
pavilion and they just be like shouting about how Christ is gonna come and
destroy the Canadian government and like how masks were the first beginning of
this grand like they're oppressed because of fucking masks I couldn't believe it
like people guess what then Ukraine you're bitching about masks guess what
they did to the Romans too right Rome must burn right became the whole it was
the grand enemy of everything that was there that wasn't their theocracy right
so yeah wow what do you project is the what do you project is the future here
what I mean let's let's try to intelligently figure this out what's
the next stage there it's there has there's gonna be some kind of
overthrowing right like this is cyclical you see this time and time and time
again across history across everything it may not have to be extreme violence
but it's gonna have to be an actual transformation there has to be a change
where these people get removed that they're no longer in the power that
they have otherwise like I don't I don't know like I see an apocalypse moment on
our hands here and when I see apocalypse it's like it's either a rebirth or
destruction you know it could go either way and like these people that were
fighting up against their get their for stagnation they're destroying and
they're desecrating nature the mother you know with everything they have and
they're telling us to keep our heads in the sand where they continue to rape her
until we all die that's that's what we're facing here yeah what about these
mobs I'll ask this question what about these mobs of they're like flash mobs
of evangelicals I mean it's not strictly just evangelicals it's it's
the people who are people who are filled with the spirit who are having
there's kind of revivals there'll be bands that go to parks and set up and
they'll just get a flash mob and it becomes an event it becomes an event
where people come and they enter into the ecstasy what do you do the Romans said
you got to stop this and they went in and broke it up and said you can't meet
like this right you can't meet so and they tagged everybody by the drugs they
were using right that was the thing for them what how do you stop these flash
mobs that they haven't turned violent yet they haven't turned violent yet right so
you know well I would say I would push back slightly on that because they have
turned violent in some in some respects we've seen mass shootings targeting
LGBT events and you see a lot of these people target specifically drag shows
or drag story time and usually you'll have specific antagonistic forces that
are present like the proud boys you know with their iconography and they're you
know no fapping in their extreme aggression and you know they're they're
out to target certain kinds of video individuals and as as pedophiles you
know like and they're waiting their weight they're waiting for this thing
called the storm and they're so well armed yeah you have the blue boys right
those guys with the guns who are actually trying to and like they pretend to be on
other people's side so that they can infiltrate and start a revolution and if
you pay attention to these darker places on the internet it's it's all very
clear like all these people you know what it is is that when people experience
extreme isolation extreme division and oppression and we all see the bleakness
it brings that the mania brings that the craziness people react in all kinds of
different ways you know and a lot of these people they get caught up in this
Christian national frenzy and it spills out in a variety of ways it's it's not
all unified you know it's it's wild so what's the if we're entering this
apocalypse then which I think it's fair to say if we have violence at this level
right and you talk about I shouldn't have I didn't dismiss it but I didn't even
consider it yeah we've got shootings all the time that are you know motivated by
this same core right this very well armed contingent these are now enemies
domestic and they'll throw that around right as if it's funny that yeah right
yeah waving a Confederate flag waving a Confederate flag and defecating
defecating on our monuments what a mess is this is this the perfect apocalypse
