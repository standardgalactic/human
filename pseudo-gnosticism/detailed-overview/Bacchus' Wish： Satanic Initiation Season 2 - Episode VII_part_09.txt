or what I mean we can have a natural extinction event here you know what I
mean if we're if we don't snap out of it don't you think I think that's that's
what I'm getting at if we don't wake up and recognize what we're doing to to
to nature to our home to our mother what future is there right like you know
there's none without her and they just they're just they they insist on
destruction yeah who were they praying to in the US Capitol they were praying to
him they were praying to a he-god who doesn't have a problem with certain
things like you know killing people that aren't righteous and aren't part of the
plan right I mean these people argue it look at the history of these people
these people argue about who is the most orthodox and why that clan ought to be
taken out right I was sick yeah I was always told about the hundred and I
think it's like 37,000 or something right the chosen people who will get to rule
over everyone for all eternity in omelenda the world to come right after
the apocalypse when the world is reborn and you're living in this
celestial theocracy for all fucking time it's a nightmare it's an absolute
nightmare that's why I think one of the I think the only solution is that tower
of battle if if if christians knew if christians knew that their own master
their own founder their own god the son of god was arrested in a public park
with a naked boy called himself a child trafficker and was part of a cult
that involves sexual relations with children I would I don't know is that
is there any way of snapping this you know sometimes
sometimes stuff will burn itself out by using it's it's all its oxygen up right
and then it's gone the fire goes away is there is there some place of reason
snappy that we could bring these people to that we could show them and reasonably
say look you know it's not your fault that you've been worshiping a pedophile
criminal this is this is an important thing because honestly I think it's it's a
two-pronged thing number one there has to be like you said reason and truth and
honesty there has to be a revealing anyone who breaks free of these kind of
cults has it does so by being shown what it really is for what it is number one
but number two there has to be a healing there has to be an integration and an
acceptance you can't just exclude people you have to
if people are willing to go through that transformation that death
to abandon those attachments those views
we have to accept them we have to let people heal
and if you don't that's when you you you extremify
now you've not given people a way out now they're they're gone
you're bound to fight each other you know we can't allow that
no I don't yeah it's a it's a global event you know the evangelicals will love this
because it'll feed their flames right because come on man that's all I'm doing is feeding
their flames right that it's very easy to get these people going right because they want to
bring the fulfillment of their own plan they want to bring it and what are they always yelling
about what are the guys yelling about from the US Capitol globalist globalist globalist
coming from this old american dominionist theology a theology anchored in an eschatology
that was punctuated by revivals right so of course they're fearing the globalists the globalists
are those who would come in but that what they don't realize is and they always do this preemptively
right it's like it's like a political party that will that will throw something out that they're
doing in order to like create a smoke screen right so you can't accuse them because they're
already accusing the other leader of doing this doing the same thing um the globalists out there
they're doing this with this globalist idea when at the same time the problem is global
look what's sweeping across russia and to georgia and all of the uh all of the fervor I mean did
you see putin's speech it was all about his gaining the religious high ground right god hates god hates
these people and for me it's always important to look at what these people hate and what they
fear okay why would they be opposed to globalism right why why are both putin and trump yelling
about that why because that way they get to maintain their fiefdoms right they get to maintain
their hegemony but their hegemonies are dying they're old they're falling apart we have to move on we
have to let this stuff go and and and be reborn into something greater right like it's it's we're
in a state of absolute insanity at this moment um like someone like putin like he everyone in the
world is telling him the writing is on the walls you have to diversify you can't stay with all of
this raw resources you have to try and incorporate and his full thing is what no fuck the entire world
you guys are the the enemy and then i'm creating this whole third rome and it's a war right you
guys are trying to destroy god and we have to protect the masculine jesus and the masculine god
like we all saw that and what's funny is they never consider but um they never consider that jesus was
people complained about him came to the disciples and complained about him and said he's touching
the kids inappropriately tell him to stop right none of that all that stuff just leaks through
history until you get down to a modern westerner holding up a sign that says jesus saves pro life
right then you realize oh my god look at what's happened just through the flow of history what's
happened with his incredible mania that's come along mania that's come along snappy it's an honor
thank you for taking i took up too much of your time tonight only because it's fascinating
and i uh thank you for coming and if you want to say goodbye say goodbye and thank you everyone
and uh if you want to we'll probably be on the discord in uh in a few uh come there and say hi
take care and have a good night hail satan hail satan everyone show me the girl i never met i wanted
so bad where is that golden palace where is that horse called destiny i think she ran off without me
