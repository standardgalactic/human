My inner Yahudi says that's not bad. My follower of Yahweh says that's not bad. Right? Kick out the wife anyway. We didn't need her anyway.
There is no divine feminine. Where's the divine feminine? Right? They're all killing female prophets. Did you know every one of these prophets has blood on their hands? And it's feminine blood better yet.
Right? They're trying to get rid of this. Solomon was bringing that stuff back in. Shout out. Shout out to everybody in Israel who I had the pleasure of working with.
Yeah. Shout out to you guys. I hope your, I hope your religious, your religious right doesn't take out what you're doing. I see what's going on. Right?
Did everybody see the fights that are going on? Oh, that's booba. You called it. You called it. Love it. Love it. They all follow reason. Yeah. They all follow reason.
My buddies at least. Right? Love it. Love it. It's good stuff. We want to see the reality. We want the text and we don't want you telling us what to do and what to wear and how to behave.
We don't want your rules. We want reality. Good. Let's go to the last, we're going to get to the last text. I got a little overly preachy tonight. I apologize.
Yeah. What's so ever? And finally, we end up with Lady Babylon. What's so ever things? You know, in whatever way she glorified herself.
Right. Right. What are you doing? Look at the str root in that one. Right. Sigma tau row. There it is. Right. What is that? What is that when you do that?
Um, yeah, you're entering that place of establishment with within the mystery.
Yeah. How do how do we're Victorians? How do you squeeze that metaphysicality out of a Victorians backside? Bring us the next slide.
Bring us the next section. Here it is. It's wax wanting wax wanting you program all of that into a Victorians head from 1850.
And they translated as to wax wanton. You have done this stuff, this stuff to glorify yourself, Lady Babylon, and to wax wanton.
You who wax wanton, Aphrodite, you who wax wanton. If there was no waxing wanton, there would be no Cyprus.
There would be no Aphrodite in Adonis. And guess what? You miserable, miserable human being. There would be no you.
For those of you who do not all honor Aphrodite in life, you receive your own self merited punishment.
Yeah. That you will never enter into that true hallelujah, that true place. Yes, you won't. And that's a curse. That's a curse, right?
Right? I curse your smelly parts, says Aphrodite. What do we do? You didn't honor me. I curse your smelly parts.
We will honor you now. It's too late. It's too late. The offense is already there. Your life is the offense. Smelly parts for you.
Do you have smelly parts? Yeah. Are you one of those? Do you need cleansing in the mystery? Do you need that purgation?
Bring up the next slide. Yep. Take a look at this. Yep. Go ahead. That one.
Oh, wrong one. You are subject to the universe as much as the next person.
You thought your life was independent and that you were living without any sort of thread being written through your life.
Your entire existence from beginning to end is a testimony. Wait, what? Yeah, is a testimony.
