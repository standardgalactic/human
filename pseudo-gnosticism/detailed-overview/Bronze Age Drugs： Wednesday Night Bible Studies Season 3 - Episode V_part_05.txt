You ask yourself, what's a vapor bath?
Remember, she's surrounded by civilian women
These women bathed themselves
As our textiles, Herodotus
With the fumigation
They have oils they put on their skin
Made out of woods
Very nice, great descriptions of this stuff
Beautiful, beautiful
There's some real, real chemistry
Right there from the beginning with all of this
Bring that up again
With these new findings
Representing the earliest evidence of drug consumption
Medea invents the vapor bath
Which you would think is like a steam bath
But it's just the exposure to the smoke of something
Isn't that neat?
It's like a fumigation
That later is called a fumigation
Nice
Apparently, she's the one who invented this
We have that attributed to her
Isn't that nice?
You can enter
When you enter into the tabernacle
I had one person tell me this week
Stop, my worldview is shatters
I don't want to keep going down this path
When you got that person who steps into the tent
The curtains that hold in all that vapor
And they're talking to God
This is pre-Moses
We're talking, Moses is coming from these traditions
They're talking about Mycenaean stuff
They're talking about 1600
Moses is later
That's why he's throwing around his serpent
People think of Charlton Heston
And that people watched Easter
The other guy with the big beard
And they hold him up
They don't realize that
That dude was throwing snakes around
He's performing magic
He built a tent
And you can go inside that tent
And you can talk to God
You will hear the voice of God
Don't worry
We're going to tie a rope to your leg
Because if you pass out, we'll drag you out
That's vapor, dude
This is Bronze Age technology
Let's go to the next quote
That they're harnessing here
These findings are so singular, said
The doc in charge
Sometimes when people think about drugs
They think it's a modern practice
These results tell us a different story
There's also those of us who
When they hear about drugs
No, it's an ancient practice
It doesn't bother us
We wouldn't be surprised
According to the study
The fluoronative to Menorca includes
The psychoactive species
Deterra, Hyoschymus, and Mandragora
Which contain the tropane derivatives
Atropine and Scopolamine
Also on the island is Ephedra
Which contains the phenylatholamine
Derivative, Ephedra, and Popoverisomniferum
Yay for the opium
This is quite a cocktail we're ending up with here
Isn't it? This is wonderful
Which has its own alkaloids
Morphene, which we all know
Everybody, big hand for morphene
Long, long, long, long history
Turns out your ancestors were
Shipping opium all over the world
Long time ago, way before they
Invited democracy, way before they did
Killing pain is killing pain, bro
The Bronze Age populations of Menorca
May have employed drug plants
For their medicinal properties
Thanks, genius
However, the high levels of toxicity
Found in the hair samples
Suggest the plant drugs were also used
For the hallucinogenic properties
In shamanic ceremonies, right?
So in shamanic ceremonies
Guess, guess, guess
Was that written in the cave?
That wasn't written in the cave
All you found is some people with drugs
Considering the potential toxicity
Of the alkaloids found in the hair
Their handling use in applications
Represent highly specialized knowledge
The author's report
Yeah, I wonder where they pass that on to
Yeah, mm
Going back to the shamans
What is wrong with you people?
Don't you know that when people think of shaman
Do you know what they think of?
Yeah, they don't think of
The queen of Colchis
Who created the Meads
Right? They don't know
They don't...
Shaman
She wasn't a shaman
She was a witch queen
Moron
Who knew the mystery
Yeah
Who dispensed
The poison of the Kidna
Love it, from her dark harbor
