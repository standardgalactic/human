You get that one, you classicist
Did that fracture
Your brain
Your dark harbor
Is your vagina
When it's covered with the burning purple
Yeah
Yeah
Did we get censored on that or something?
Chewie, hang on Chewie
Did we just hit an asteroid or something?
What was that?
Wow, okay, I gotta...
Oh, are we...
We're overheating, hang on
It's too much, I start talking about...
Yeah, about the pudinda
We'll say it politely and scientifically
The pudinda finisciana
The purple harbor
That's where all sailors go
The ones who sail into the ion
That's where they go
Okay, let's keep going
These people are getting creepy
Plants like henbane and belladonna
Produce atropin and scopolamine
But the plant that these Bronze Age people
Were most likely eating
Was thorn apple, also known as gymsenweed
It has distinct spiky seed pods
And muted lavender flowers
Okay, nice, nice, nice
But what does it do? Look
Reportedly some potent often nightmarish trips
That's where you want to get
When you get here
Some of these reports talk about
What's the use of these?
It's gotta be sacred
One of the authors said it's not the profane
It's the sacred, right?
And you're asking yourself
Why are they so crazy about the fact
That this can't be some people in the Bronze Age
Kicking back and getting
Recreationally super high
Going to a religious performance
That their family goes to
That their grandparents had been to
You know, that's why the people wear
The dye in their hair, man
It's just part of the society
It's part of our medicine
So what is wrong with you people?
What is wrong?
The modern Iron Age
Poop
Where's the next one?
Right here?
Here we go
I got an alarm going on
I'm sure you'd better find out what that is
The recovery of human hair
By Bronze Age burial cave
Provides a unique opportunity
For the probe and to the medicinal
And ritual realm
Of indigenous inhabitants
Of Western Mediterranean
3,000 years ago
The results finished direct evidence
Yeah, finished direct evidence
Of the consumption of plant drugs
Okay, okay
So yeah, we know that they took drugs now
I'm going to skip over that
And we're going to go to
Recent analysis of hair
Watch this
There's one really good scientific article
On this one, right?
In nature
And it's a fantastic
It's a fantastic article
And it goes over methods, right?
Analysis
You can get all the chemistry
For those of you geeks who are
HPLC people
And know what that means
You know, mass spectrometers
And all that kind of stuff
Equipment that we need
If that stuff turns you on
Then take a look at the one in nature
But here's a funny
Here's a funny reference to that
Recent analysis of hair
Of patients suffering from
Detura poisoning
Revealed atropine and scopolamine
In a patient who admitted
Regular consumption of detura
And only scopolamine
In a regular cannabis abuser
Wait a minute
A regular...
Is this thing scientific?
Do you people see what happens?
As soon as you get into this
World of the recreation
As soon as you get into this
World of the high
All of a sudden it's not acceptable
Right?
The cannabis abuser
How many people...
You can't abuse cannabis
That scientist needs to find out
That you can't abuse cannabis
You can't
You learn to make love
Not war
They should have said
The lover of cannabis
