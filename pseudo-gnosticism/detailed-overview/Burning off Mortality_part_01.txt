Like a pantomime
Right?
We're friggin' pantomimes
Oh, look at the drug use
Fantastic, go to the next one
Go to the next one
This is where I want to begin
What do I want to show you tonight?
This is the apocalypse
Who has what?
Who has ears?
Let them hear
What the Spirit says
To your assemblies
To those of you who overcome
I will give to you to eat
From the tree of Zoe
Okay
Wait, wait, wait
Who's Zoe?
Just in case anybody stepped out
We got out of the spaceship tonight, right?
Spacetime
We went back in the past
We're at the rights
Right, because that's all we ever do
You know it's a date thing
You and I have
You'd love it
You'd love going to these rights
You'd love going to them
On the internet right now
There are a ton of people
Who will tell you
This is the Ellucinian
This is the Ellucinian
This is the Ellucinian
This is the Ellucinian
Psychiatrist, psychologist
Mythicist
Oh, God
Oh, God
Indeed
Indeed
Tonight we look at the particulars
I'm going to take you into a Christing
Hail Satan
I'm going to take you into a Christing
That you have never seen
And it will explain to you
Exactly what Jesus was doing
Welcome to the mystery
Let's go
Now they're trying to sell this online
Anytime you buy a mystery course online
You're the one who's going to the back alleys
I don't want Satanic congregation
Hanging out in the back alleys
Okay, don't, don't
You're going to pay for it
You're going to pay for it
Yeah, and I don't mean money
Let's go to the next one
What is the promise here?
I know
I know people
I know what kind of troubles everybody's in
I know your poverty
Right, but you're really rich
You're not like that Satanic congregation
Wait, are you kidding me?
The Satanic congregation
Look, people, it's a letter
Oh, my God, it's a letter
And it's to us
Well, it's really to somebody else
But they're talking about us
You see, tonight the theme is
We're listening in on your conversations
And what does the Satanic congregation do
That really ticks them off?
Look at that second line, fourth word in
Blasphemeon
Blasphemeon
Do you want to hear the blasphemy?
Go ahead, take it down and poison the brains
Of everybody here tonight, Chewie
Do you want to hear the blasphemy of blasphemies?
I've got it for you
Take a seat, everybody who's eating your dinner
It looks marvelous, I can imagine it
It looks marvelous
Thank you for allowing me to be with you at this time
I thank you, on a Monday, fantastic
What is the blasphemy of blasphemies?
Tell us, Almond
Tell us, do you want to know?
First have to say, do you want to know?
Oh, you're going to love this
Are you ready?
God is a fabrication
Yahoo has a birth date
Before which time he did not exist
And do you know when his birthday is?
Yahoo, Yahoo, when's your birthday?
Everybody, happy birthday to Yahoo
Happy birthday to Yahoo
Happy birthday, Elohim Hashim Jova
It was in the third century
Show me the text
How does a person get to that point?
That can be so sure of himself
It's not me, people
It's not me
It's the muse
Muse of history, brah
All you got to do is follow
All you got to do is follow those words
It's in the words
They're evidence, man
They're the amber
That keeps all of that gorgeousness
Gorgeousity, all warm and snugly
Until one of us can drill into it
Take out a sample and find whatever it is
That mosquito was eating
20 million years ago
Oh, God, I love it, I love it
Okay, give me the next one
We can't let this go
It's going to get, well, hold on, people
Life vests on tonight
This is going to get a little bit heavy
Those of you who have those ears to hear
Like we're talking about
Satanic congregation, right?
This is what that muse says to you
The one who overcomes
Will not be treated unjustly
By the second death
They won't come across that second death
As a thing of decay
As a moment of justice, right?
There is something about going there
And coming back
Creates a bridge to understanding
Let's go to the next one
I think they gave us the drugs, yeah?
I think they gave us the drugs, right?
People, I want you to focus now on this image
I'm going to read to you from the hymn
There are four girls
And they are like goddesses
Four girls like goddesses
And what does it say?
The second half of that first line
What are these girls have?
They have the flower, anthos
They have the flower that is kureion
The flower of the korwa
This is old
You see statues of these korwa
All over the place, right?
And what do they have?
What are those?
They are in korek bloom
They are in korek bloom
Now you ask yourself
Who is it that we worship?
We worship the underworld korwa
That's who we worship
What do you think we do?
What we do?
Everybody comes and we all get initiated, right?
You're welcome for democracy
You're welcome
Such contempt
Go up, give me the source again
Chewie, when we were just...
Yeah, so here are these four girls
And they're in their korek bloom
And here are their names
What are their names?
Kalidike
Oh, that's nice
Beautiful justice is what her name means
Isn't that nice?
