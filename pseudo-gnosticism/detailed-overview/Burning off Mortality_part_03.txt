The first time I read that I was like,
Oh, I get it
I didn't get it before
I get it
You see, gods can't age
And why can't gods age?
We're burning off the mortality
Why can't gods age?
Because they're full of ambrosia
Full of ambrosia
Do you have the ambrosia tonight?
Do you want the fruit of the tree?
I'll take two, please
I'll take two
Who's this handsome devil who's serving us tonight?
Oh, god, do you know what this is?
This is a picnic in the park
Not just any park, but paradise
Right, now do you see who the ay-wa is?
Now do you see who the ay-wa is?
Right
Oh, god
Right out of the third century, people
Right?
God's birth
Yahoo!
He came out of the third century
Wasn't here before
That's why everybody is chasing
Is currently chasing stones
To try to find
That says yesahoo
No, no, no, no
It's gotta say yahoo way
Right?
And so this is how we do it
They're fighting
They're looking for it
I got news for you, people
He wasn't born until the third
Moses and Noah, all of them
They're a third century creation
Isn't it interesting?
Stop for a minute and look into the mirror
Especially if you're an evangelical
Look into that mirror
Your world is a fantasy
Generated in the third century B.C.
Your world is a fantasy
Generated in the third century
Anybody, anybody at a church
Or a synagogue
Your reality is a falsehood
It's a falsehood
You're modest
What happened was your religion
Was a modest creation
That is a one god
Right?
A one god creation
At a specific time in history
You, if you have a synagogue
Or a church
You are a reaction
To the multiplicity of gods
Like love and like
Complete and total
Erotic desire
And justice
Don't forget justice
Don't you love nemesis?
Come on, people
Who wouldn't worship nemesis?
That dude got what he deserved
Don't you want to see
The dude get what he deserves?
You want to
Why?
Because you and I
We worship nemesis
We are the dawn bringers
We are the dawn bringers
We have to be on
100% with everything
That's the standard
You want to follow the satanic contract
You want that esoteric knowledge
You have to prove that you can handle it
Isn't that something?
It's amazing
You can't sell it
You can't sell it
I don't want your money
I don't want your money
Devil hates that stuff
Go to the next one
Okay, people, look
This is going to get good
Hit the next one
After antitamos
Fine, what is an epelucie?
Right?
It's a power, right?
Demeter knows those powers of literally
Those things that come over you
Those things that bind you
That envelop you, right?
Look how they translate it here
Coming over by spells
A, B, witching
Do you understand what the witch does now?
That witch is going to work in ways
That you may call medicinal, right?
She understands that it's a juggling of your forces
That is an attraction and a repulsion
She knows
She has the pharma con cristo
She has the pharma con cristo
Because she's got the knowledge and antiquity
Of where to find those roots, man
And she goes out with the ladies
And they strip down naked
And they oil themselves up
And they collect roots
And if they catch you as a man out there
Because of the substances that they're using
Because remember, collecting roots is a ritual
You know, just go out and dig into the ground
Like some, you know, goodness
I can't say the R word or I'll get in trouble
But you know what I mean?
It rhymes with papest
Did you ever notice that?
Okay, let's go, let's go
Look at that workshop, by the way
That's a gorgeous workshop
I bet you could put books in there too
And then the books would smell
I used to go to Dr. John Scarborough's basement
When I was a graduate student
We would go after school
This is fun, I can tell you this
We would go after classes
I was one of his graduate students
And he only had two at the time, right
And we would go out to have
To the pub, to the pub
And have a pint after class
And yeah, those joyous moments
Would be ended by us ending up
Back at his house in his basement
He has this giant basement
And he had just thousands upon thousands of books
And he was a collector through black wells
I think it was
And so he got books all the time
It was just impossible to get
And he had this incredible collection
Smelled, they all smelled of pipe tobacco
Everyone, you'd open up those books
And it just hits you in the face
You had to smoke, you know
In order to be there in those books
He fumigated that place
That's how you hold a museum, baby
That's how you do it
I got a lot of respect
I got a shout out for John Scarborough
Hit the next one
What I want to show you tonight is this
Look at number two
This thing that is the safeguard
Against witchcraft, the Erosimos
It is also a vegetable
The seed of which was eaten by women
In childbirth
Now, notice that we've come to a place of
You think we've come to the hospital
I told you we're in the temple, right
We're performing the mysteries
And one of those have to do with
They're directly connected to
The art of childbirth
Your mystery cult comes from childbirth
And a bunch of very intelligent
Chemically driven women
Yeah, gorgeous, I love it, man
