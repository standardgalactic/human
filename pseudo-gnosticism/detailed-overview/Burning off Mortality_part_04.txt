It makes me so
I want these women to come back
Where are these women?
Right, where are these women?
Who's building the portals
To bring these women back?
This is for the portal builder
Get it done
Give me the next one
Let's get something that
No Bible scholar in his life
Now, this next verse will shatter
Every Bible scholar
Every...
Well, lots of religion scholars
But mostly the Bible scholars
Yeah, man, I mean old and new
Torah and New Testament
You know what I mean?
Prophets through the prophets in there
Right, for you guys
I'm speaking to you with this one
This is going to blow your mind, right
She nourished...
What is Da Maitre Demeter?
What does she do?
She nourishes the boy in the home
And he grows
Like a demon
That's what it says
He grows like a demon
He becomes better in a demonic way
He doesn't eat
He doesn't eat food
And you won't see him taking the milk
Right?
You're not going to see him taking the milk
Of anybody, right?
During the day
Demeter who wears that gorgeous crown
She cries him
Look at the second to last line
Riesk
And they have lighted
They have lighted the epsilon at the end of that
So it can run together musically
Because it sounds better to say
Riesk ambrosie
Than it does
Riesk ambrosie
You hear her?
Riesk ambrosie
Ho, ho, ho
Now I sound like those stupid Anglo-Saxons
Okay, that's why they make...
They take out letters in Greek
Let it flow
Let it flow
We don't do that with our language people
Sorry, sorry
It's just the way it is
What does that say, though?
She cries him with ambrosia
Go ahead
Go ahead
She cries him
With ambrosia
Okay
Now what does the ambrosia do?
The ambrosia is that ionic power
That keeps us from dying
That boy is having his mortality removed
Okay, let's see
Let's see
Now look
Right there is a reference
Now this...
This hymn...
What am I reading to you?
This is the hymn...
The Homeric hymn to Demeter, bruh
This doesn't...
This doesn't get any more authoritative
Dude
Yeah, this is it
This is it, people
And we are Christing
We are Christing
And who is Christing?
Our savior is Christing
Are you crazy?
Let's burn him up
Give me the next one
No, that one
Yep, good
Look
Now there is a strange expression here
On the last line
It says
What does Demeter do?
And this is so sexy, beautiful
If you can't see the sexiness in this
You're an idiot
It says
What is she doing?
She's breathing into him
This sweetness
She's breathing into him
The sweetness
Give me the next
I've got the definition here
Give people to see it
Give me that one
Maybe this one
Go
No, that's the hymn
We're going to come back to that
Here it is
Oh, right
Oh, my God
What does it mean to blow upon?
To breathe upon?
Yeah, look at number two
To inspire
Oh, yeah
And then three again to blow upon
That one would blow Dan's mind
Because look, you can pick the bottom one
But it's the same as the top one
So his logic would be like circular
It may cause a little
In his brain
You know what I mean?
Just a little
Why?
Like some circus
We're just like, nope
Overheated, boom
Love it
Go back to the passage
What does she do?
She cries him with that ambrosia
And she inspires him
And then we get this fine
This last
Oh, and it says
As if he is the son of God
As if he is the son of God
What is she doing?
She's Christing him with ambrosia
As you do
With the sons of God
And there were in those days
The sons of God
And the daughters of men
And the sons of God
Because they had had their mortality
Burned away
Yeah
They taught
Those daughters of men
They taught them how
With the drugs
That's what it says, Enix says anyway
Love it
Let's go back
Do you see how it works now?
Is everybody getting it?
Nah, right
People are always writing me saying
Oh, now this makes sense
Did you know X, Y, and Z?
Exactly
Right?
Clicks in
As soon as you see the reality of the text
And the anthropology of the culture
That thing is submerged in
Oh, God, it's just so glorious
But then we get this last phrase
So she cries him with the ambrosia
As the son of God
And she inspires him with this sweetness
And then
She has or possesses him
In her colpo scene
Now, colpos
