It forms a permanent
Permanent antidote in their brain
Yeah
That's why we need to show them
We, Satanic congregation
We should uphold the Bible
More than anyone
Right?
It's funny
The trick was
In the dream
The trick was not to run from it
The trick was to run toward it
Yeah
That's where the victory comes from
And to those who achieved the victory
I will give
To overcome that second death
Oh, God
It's gross
It's gross, man
It's the grossest stuff on the planet
Give me the next one
Watch what happens here
We didn't go through the choreo
But we don't have to
This is good, Chewie
I like that you landed
What does she do with that boy
That she is putting through the operation
To burn off his mortality
During the night time
Because remember we said
What happens during the day
She's Christing him during the day
And what does she do in the night?
She hides him in the fire
She hides him in the fire
He's like a torch
He's like a torch
Do you know what a torch is?
You put stuff on it
And it burns
Okay
If that mother
Had not stopped
Domated from creating that transformation
If she hadn't stopped the process
That boy would have understood
Who he was
He would have seen
And he would have lost his fear
He would become as a god
The fruit of the tree
Is there for you
The fruit of the tree is there
Alright
Let's go to the next one
That was a somber
That was too somber
Give them the hymn
I want you to see the hymn now
This is the Orphic hymn
To Ellisonian Demeter
This is the Orphic hymn
To Ellisonian Demeter
And I want you to go down
To the...
Oh god it's so beautiful
That word, first of all
In the third line
Pluto de Tera
She's really the giver
Of what is wealth
What is wealth
And it's not money
That's the problem
You don't see right
You haven't been there
You don't see right
You still have that corruption
Your greed stains your soul
What it stains your ruin
Okay
And what is she
I just want you to scroll down
Oh where did it go
Oh god there was something
Oh yes look she's the
Look in the underlined red portion
She's the soonestius
Of Bromius Dionysus
What does she do
You didn't know this did you
She's that one who stands next to him
She's that one who comes
To his defense
She is that assistant
She is that nourisher
Of the child
She's the dimon
It says at the top
She's the pole
Who automate dimon
What does that mean
She's the dimon
With many names
Have you heard of somebody
Who is dimon
Of many names
Lady Babylon
Lady Babylon is
She of many names
The mystery is written
On her forehead
Oh god how sexy
Is that how sexy is that
Yeah yeah your third
Century jealous
Woman hating
Divinity you monists
You're just like Akhenaten
You're just like that group
Right that's what the religion does
It's what human religion does
So physics
It goes monist
And when it does
Everybody outside the box
Can justifiably die
It doesn't matter if it's women
Doesn't matter if it's men
Doesn't matter if it's old people
Doesn't matter if it's kids
Whoever is outside the box
Woo that's some awful stuff
I want you to look at what else is in here
What else is in this hymn
Look she is conveyed
See those other two
Underline red there
She's conveyed by the what
The power of the dragons
By the power of the dragons
And just look at that
Underlined word
That says dracontheon
Dracontheon
And look directly above it
And you're going to see the word
Paidophile
Paidophile
Paidophile
Does that sound like anything I know
Paidophile
Well, the fee-loss route is to love
And the pice is a child
Who is that one
Who performs the initiation
The paidophile
Yes
Give me the definition
Look at what these Victorians did
They're so embarrassed
You brits, I have a number
Of very intelligent people
Across the Atlantic
And across the pond
Who are sitting there
And following the traditions
That the Brits made
With the Oxford
Greek lexicon
The LSJ Alice
And those people there
And what do they say
They're hymn and hawn baby
Why do we have to say one thing is another
Just come out and say what it is
It's too Victorian
Purge the Victorian blood
You people in England
This is for those
You know when I was in Newcastle
And that group of
Saucy ladies of the evening came
Surrounded me
