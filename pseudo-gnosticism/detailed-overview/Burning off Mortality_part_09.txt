Classicists
Here's one last example
I just want to throw this to you
Look at verse 7, come on now
Let's go down in
Let's confound their tongue
Let's confound their tongue
It's in the singular
Everybody
Strokes for everyone
Says God, this is God
Yes, the humans are cooperating
Right
So, you know, that's never good
So, they can't hear each other
They can't hear their own voices
Let's go down and
They're tongue
What does that mean?
Just look at the third line down
To pour together, to come together
Or to confound
That sounds odd, like an odd group
To be putting together
They have a word that means to bring together
And
In doing so, to confound
You know what an epileptic seizure is?
It's when your timing
Is all brought together
It's when those nerves start firing off in unison
You get a little storm
In the brain, and that's an epileptic seizure
Right
Oh God
Do you understand what they're grasping?
Now watch this, give me the
Give me the next one
Which is the Hebrew
Look, those are those three words
Now watch this, get that definition
Here's a Hebrew word
Which, oh my God
Happens to mean exactly
The same thing
That an already established Greek word
Is meant for centuries
What are you looking at?
You are looking
At proof
That
Hebrew is constructed
Around Greek
Did you hear that?
Did you hear that?
This will make them so mad
This will make everybody
So mad
Don't you love it?
It's gorgeous, isn't it?
We're creating words now
That are the exact mirrors
Right, we're taking culture
And why is that?
Because this is the culture
The Jewish people
Or person, we don't know how many authors there were
Doesn't say
That the Jewish people
Who created the Torah
Those people
Were trying to
Borrow
From the power of the Greek language
They were harnessing
That power to bring it in
To create
And that's why it's in the beginning
Uranos
Two gods
Two Hellenistic creation
Gods right up top
It's the language of Greek
That is the origin
Of the Hebrew Bible
Give me the last one
This is gorgeous
Look what happens
Look what they do
They start talking about Arabic
Arabic
Because they want
Some sort of semantic connection
And you would think
When is the oldest Arabic from?
They'll say
8th century
8th century BC
Show me
It doesn't exist then
We don't have any surviving
We just think
Are you kidding?
Are you joking me?
When is the first written Arabic?
It's in the 500s
Anodomani
Do you see what the language is doing?
This is incompetence
This is complete
Incompetence
But it is driven
By a powerful desire
Just like you have the
Numerologist
It's driven by an extreme
Desire
To justify
The language itself
Look, this language is legitimate
And the claims that the texts make
Are legitimate
It's an attempt to create
Legitimacy
Wow, but it's a creation nonetheless
The sacred Hebrew
Is attempting
To reflect the Greek
Of the original
Isn't that gorgeous?
Let's round this out
With Penelope
Use all of your images
Oh, Penelope
We come to you tonight
With the utmost humility
For we know, Penelope
What lies behind your cross
We know
That like us
We are covered
By the blood of Christ
The one
Who is burning off our mortality
The
Tidophile
Oh, God
Oh, God
Thank you for coming tonight
I'm sorry if what you've been seeing
Is disturbing
And I know you'll be a little bit disoriented
Don't worry
Sleep it off and tomorrow
Everything will be normal again
No, I'm just kidding
It's going to be stuck in your brain forever
Have a great night
Thank you everybody for coming
The fact that 841 people are here
Others to take seriously
What we're talking about
To open up the museum
I want everybody to hear to know
If I were there, I'd give you
I'd give you just a gorgeous hug
I'd give you just a gorgeous, lovely hug
Just imagine it
Thank you for coming tonight
Hail Satan
Don't bring up
Group cutter
New singer
Athena lover
Don't bring up
Group cutter
New singer
Athena lover
The devil rides out
The Irish witch
I'm with the dragon lady
Don't not bring
Roots I cut
I am being
Madea's love
