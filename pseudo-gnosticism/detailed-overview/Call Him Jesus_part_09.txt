And all we have to do, you know, we don't have to look at them and believe them.
We don't have to make a cult. We don't have to create some kind of faith.
No, that's not what we're here for.
We're here to take those texts and say, what do they tell us about those people?
What do they tell us about our ancestors?
What do they tell us about earlier civilizations and what happened to them?
Most importantly, what do they tell us about civilizations that created the worship of a muse
and things like democracy sprang from it?
That's most important. That well is most important.
Okay, it looks like we're out of time tonight. That's okay.
Neil, have a nice dream. This is for Neil and his dream.
Here, Neil, have a little spanky wanky.
Thank you for coming tonight. I appreciate you being here.
It means a lot to me that you care about these texts.
