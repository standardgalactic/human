I think in the end he will turn out to be the devil.
The devil says,
I greet you, man on the high tower.
I saw you from afar watching and waiting.
Your waiting has called me.
Jung, who are you?
Devil, who am I?
You think I am the devil?
Do not pass judgment.
Perhaps you can talk to me without knowing who I am.
What sort of superstitious fellow are you that immediately you think you are the devil?
I am sorry for what is about to happen.
I am going to bring you raw Jung.
This will hit a nerve that is so deep.
I will get 20 comments on this.
This one.
We have to do it.
He deserves it.
You know he deserves it.
The devil says,
what are you waiting for?
Jung says, I await all kinds of things.
I am waiting for someone of the world's wealth.
Excuse me.
We all knew it.
It is disgusting.
It is not art for art's sake.
What we do not see here to come to me.
He is waiting for the wealth which he has not gotten yet.
Devil.
I have come to absolutely the right place.
Where you expect the devil to be.
To the person who needs punishment.
I have wanted a long time through the world.
Seeking those like you who sit upon a high tower and look out for things unseen.
Is that you in the midst of the mystery?
Are you in that position?
Yes.
The devil is asking you.
Jung.
You make me curious.
You seem to be a rare breed.
Your appearance is not ordinary.
It seems to me that you bring with you a strange air.
What kind of air you have, punk?
Something worldly.
Something impudent.
Yes, now he is talking.
Love it.
Or exuberant.
Or in fact, something pagan.
It makes me want to go over there and have another moment.
I won't.
I won't.
Something pagan.
Can you hear Jung?
Can you hear Jung?
Okay, good.
Devil, you don't offend me.
On the contrary, you hit your nail on the head.
But I'm no old pagan as you seem to think.
Jung.
I don't want to insist on that.
You are not pompous and Latin enough.
I like that.
Sometimes, Jung is funny.
You have nothing classical about you.
You seem to be a son of our time.
But as I must remark, a rather unusual one.
You're no real pagan.
But the kind of pagan who runs alongside our Christian religion.
He's doing that all the time.
You truly, you're truly, the devil says,
you truly a good diviner of riddles.
Oh, you're doing better than many others
who have totally mistaken me.
Good for you.
Yeah, good.
You sound cool and staring says Jung.
Have you never broken your heart over the holiest mysteries
of our Christian religion?
Are you ready?
We're about to.
You're a devil.
You're an unbelievably ponderous and serious person.
Are you always so insistent?
I love that.
I love that.
Did you see that in the interview?
He's there.
You saw that.
I would before God always like to be as serious and true to myself
as I try to be blah, blah, blah.
Jung devil.
You're superstitious and too German.
You take literally what the scriptures say.
Otherwise you could not judge me so hard.
Jung a hard judgment is the last thing I would want.
But my nose does not play tricks on me.
You're evasive and I don't want to.
And you don't want to reveal yourself.
What are you hiding?
The red one grows redder devil.
I hide nothing from you.
You true heart and soul.
I simply amuse myself with your weighty seriousness
and your comic veracity.
This is so rare in our time, especially in men who have understanding at their disposal.
I believe you cannot fully understand me says Jung.
You apparently compare me with those whom you know, but I must say you for the sake of truth
that I neither really belong to this time nor to this place.
Listen to him.
