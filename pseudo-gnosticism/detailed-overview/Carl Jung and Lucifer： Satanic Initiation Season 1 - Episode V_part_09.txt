okay, offer me your definitions of logos.
And then I could take you and I could show you
and you'd be shocked.
But it's rational and it makes sense.
And it allows you to see how that logos was used
when John says in Arche and her logos
that you know not from a Baptist perspective,
not from a Catholic's perspective,
not from a scholar's perspective,
but from the perspective of the people
who actually wrote the document,
that's invaluable.
That's invaluable.
That's the only way you're getting evidence.
If we're ever going to solve the crime
of the naked boy with Jesus,
we need hardcore evidence.
And I appreciate everybody who's been saying,
nice job, keep it up.
You people are encouraging me.
So I need that.
And I need to know that you're out there
and that you're following.
And that in following you're opened up
like people are saying and you're saying,
oh my God, what is this?
And now you're asking questions
because that's what it's all about.
And our eyes are open.
As much as we want to fear.
I love that.
We've got Lord Snappie
and he shaved his head
and we've got a testimonial.
I just thank you everybody
for taking part, participating, commenting.
It's just great to see it unfold.
I really enjoy watching this unfold.
I mean, I love the research.
I love watching this unfold.
And on behalf of Lord Snappie
who I was talking about earlier,
I very much must point out
that in this death morning
that we're entering
in this period of morning Adonis,
of morning Jehovah,
we're not just morning Jehovah.
We're morning his son and his son's bride
because our vision will show us
what contradicts the fairy tale
that reality that we've all grown up in.
It's gorgeous.
Saternian, satanic, Judaism, Christianity.
Yes, what are the satanic origins
of Judaism and Christianity?
And don't tell me
because your guy throws around snakes
and can do what the Egyptians do
with their hiccups.
Don't tell me that he is not a magician.
Completely following Saternian.
Look, he even sets up an oracle.
Moses sets up an oracle.
Most people, if you just tell them that,
they're going to be confused, right?
Moses sets up an oracle.
Yeah, in the wilderness,
in a tent with a bunch of smoking botanicals.
And you go in there to what
so that you can talk to the God.
They call it in the Saternian.
That's the place that's erected
for you to meet the God face to face.
This is gorgeous.
I hope that someday people find out
that Judaism is indeed
a Bronze Age satanic religion
and that that's nothing to be ashamed of.
That their roots go back
not to the Hebrew
and not to the Masoretic tradition.
That's way late.
They go back to the Saternian
oracular cult
that allows us to enter into a place of vision.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Maybe that was Moses
we were working with tonight in Jung.
I'll put Jung back in his cage.
Rob, do you have any final points?
Yeah, that was my last question.
Are you keeping Jung there?
Don't let him go. Don't let him go.
He always stays with me.
He always stays with me.
We will work on his seal
and presenting it directly to everyone
so that Jung like a meat puppet
can be used to talk to everyone here.
It's a necromancer's prerogative.
Yes, until next time.
Hail Satan and thank you.
Thank you everybody.
Thank you.
