Watch what happens here.
Next text.
Look at this.
And whoops.
And so, take it down for a second.
So what does Jesus do?
He says, I'll show you who it is.
The one that I give this to that takes it, they're the one.
This is going to betray me.
Yeah.
And he takes a little morsel and he baptizes it.
He does what?
He baptizes it with just a couple of little drops of the purple.
And he gives it to him.
And when he gives it to him, when he gives them the Entheon Arton, when he gives him
the bread infused with the burning purple, he goes nuts.
He goes nuts.
Jesus pushes him, pushes him right off the edge.
Right?
He says, watch this.
When he had those kids' feet washed, do you know what he said to them?
Do you know what I've done to you?
Yeah.
He's naked.
He's got that bull catching that water, washing those feet, looking right down at his glory.
And you don't think his glory was there?
Bring on the glory of Jesus.
We've got to see the glory of Jesus.
Where is it?
Okay, wait.
We've got to read this right after he takes that infused bread.
What happens?
Satan jumps into him.
Yeah.
And Jesus says, okay, go do it.
Take it down.
Take it down.
Take it down.
What is he going to do?
That little program kid, that poor guy.
He didn't have a chance coming, Bill.
That's Bill Cosby, Jesus Christ.
Love it.
Love it, Jesus.
Love your work.
Such a masterful manipulation.
It was brilliant.
Let's see.
Let's see what Jonas thinks.
Next passage, please.
Next passage.
Yep.
Well, I think that was it.
Yeah.
And so taking it, you know, it just says another one.
He went out and it was nighttime.
And yeah, here's what Jonas, here's how Jonas translates this.
Look, at about evening, he made a banquet, a banquet of this love gathering.
And this third line from the bottom says, and Jesus performed.
He constructed an elaborate work.
It was woven together.
What was it?
By the power, bottom line, by the power of a wrestling demon.
He used a barb.
He used the barb of greed.
What?
He used the barb of greed.
To what?
He used the barb of greed.
To an oistres Santos.
To what?
Do you see the oistress in there?
Everybody who's been there with me for the whole time.
Do you see the oistress?
That's the mania.
He is making him enter a Bacchic frenzy.
A Bacchic frenzy.
Bring up the definition for, yep, look at this.
Just so, in case you don't believe me, follow the purple, right?
An oistreo, to goad to madness.
And where do you see it?
Euripides Bacchai.
Look at the Greek in that second line.
What does it say?
It says having been goaded to that madness by love, right?
Goading the heart.
Goading the heart.
That's what Jesus is doing.
He's goading the heart of Judas.
Yeah.
Oh God.
God, he's doing it.
Isn't that genius?
That's genius.
That's why Nona says, this is a brilliant plan.
This is a brilliant plan.
This man is maniacal, but he's a genius.
And he's currently in a room full of boys that he just got naked in front of.
Okay, bring us that source one more time.
We're almost there, Neil.
We're almost there.
Yeah.
Is that the second one?
Yeah.
Okay.
And so this is just more of that same text.
So he created this world.
Look at that second line.
Look at that second line.
So he made this banquet.
This is the rewriting of John.
And he, oh, what does that third line say?
Here it is.
Take it.
Take it down.
I'm sorry.
Take it down.
Is everybody ready?
Drum roll, please.
Ladies and gentlemen, I am proud to present to you for the first time in human history,
the unveiling of the genitalia of Jesus Christ.
Let's see it.
Look at the third line.
Look at the third line.
He took off his clothes.
They covered his glorious meat.
His glorious meat.
Look at the word.
His meat, his flesh is shining.
It is resplendent.
Resplendent like what?
Resplendent with strength.
Go ahead.
Go ahead.
No, take that one down.
That's his flesh.
He showed his flesh.
You have to give it to Jesus for showing his flesh.
