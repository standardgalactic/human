Let's see what he advises us to do. And this is your God, Christianity, by the way, church. This is your husband. Yeah. Yeah. This is your husband flesh.
He's a killer and you'd love it. You'd salivate over this stuff. Sick people.
Let's go back to the Deuteronomy. What's going to happen? We're going to go in and these people, now I'm telling you, right? I'm voices Yahoo.
These people, these people are going to be doing things. They're going to be money Elmenos, right? And they're going to be Montaeon.
They're going to be doing what? They're going to be doing mantic things in a mantic way. They're going to be making mantic stuff.
See, in signs, reading bird sign. Isn't that nice? Taking the stuff. And what does he say in number 11? What does he say in number 11?
Far makos ap aedon epe oidein. Oh, isn't that gorgeous? What's he going to do? He's going to take away their drugs.
Why? He says the person using the drugs does epodes. They enter into these chants and they do their chants and you're going to, we can't do that.
You're going to stop doing that. We're going to stop them from doing it. How are we going to stop them from doing it? God, we're going to kill them all.
Yes, fantastic. Go. Let's see it again. This God is so, so wonderful, isn't he? What else do they do?
They're engastrimuthos and teratoscopos. They're looking for signs and miracles.
What else do they do? They do this engastrimuthos thing, where they bring out the voice from the inside. It's a woman's thing.
If you look it up, it's something the women do and they bring it out from that inside. You would think it's the stomach, but it's not.
That's how they refer to being pregnant, having engastri. Something really neat going on there, but Yahoo wants us to kill them all.
Let's go back to that one. Let me just make sure we didn't miss anything. Yahoo told us to do. Take down initiating apocalypse there.
Here we go. There we go. These things are Delegma 12. These things are pollution to the Yahoo and doing them is a bad thing.
He doesn't want you to. He says, I'm going to go in and destroy these people and you're going to be teleos. You're going to be what? You're going to be teleos.
What does Yahoo want you to be? Bring the next slide. I think I've got a picture of this thing. After Delegma, right?
It'll come up later. It'll come up later. Let's go back. We're still with Moe. Let's go.
Moe and Deuteronomy. Love it. Keep going. By the way, for the people who say, where are your choices? They're sitting right in front of you.
Fantastic. Where are we going? Do we get lost? Big thing on the screen. Big brown thing.
Perfect. Thank you. When you're going to go in, he says, and you're going to disinherit them. They're going to be doing these things like trying to take signs, being mantic.
You're not supposed to follow these things. He says, I'll give you a profit. They're using the same systems.
Do you ever notice the Egyptians are doing exactly the same? They're using the same systems, but this Yahoo doesn't want you to just come in and integrate.
He wants you to destroy these people. How does he want you to destroy them? Ready? I'm going to show you what the text says. God says.
Are you ready? Let's listen to the words of God. Isn't that satanic of me? By the way, every time I hear of somebody who couldn't watch or could only watch a few minutes or left the room, anytime I hear these stories, I get so tickled.
Because that's exactly what the devil would do. Beautiful. It's gorgeous. Let's find out what happens. What do you want me to do?
Yahoo, come on. Come on, Yahoo. Take your pants down, Yahoo. Oh, what a heavenly bottom. Oh, Yahoo, say Yahoo.
Feels good. Let's go. Next source. Look, people, where did we get the delugma, right? Look where it is. It's here. Delugmaton, right? Next to the bottom. What is this text about? This is the apocalypse. This is the woman dressed up in the purple.
And do you know what she has? She has a golden cup, right? She's got precious. This thing is beautiful. It's a gorgeous thing. What is it inside of it? The delugmata, right? Those, that.
And what is it? It's that acafarsia, that which is not purged of the porneia of Lady Babylon. What is her porneia? The porneia, and I'll say this is, look, people get excited and they get mad and angry.
