I just want to get it right.
Right here.
He was in the pints.
We had pints every day about three o'clock.
We kick off and go to one of the pubs.
Really?
Yeah.
And then I would.
How old was he when you worked with him?
A wander home.
Oh, he was in his at least 55.
Yeah.
Maybe 60 by the time.
Yeah.
Yeah.
In that range.
Yeah.
And look, here it is in Revelation.
This first word is Sumbuleo.
Okay.
I counsel you.
That's all it says.
I counsel you to what?
Look at the third to last line.
The second, the two words in the end of the third to bottom
are Kai and Collurion.
Collurion is a drug.
And the word on the next line is Inrisai.
Bring it up.
Bring it up.
Show me, Chewie.
This is the verb there.
Are you ready?
Here it is.
This is in the Bible, people.
And it means to what?
You can see in the middle.
If you take off the first two letters, Danny,
you see the chris on it.
Chris.
Right?
That's from our Chrio or from our Christos.
And what is he telling him to do?
Bring up that one more time.
He's telling him to in Christ your eyes.
The word Othalmus is there.
So we have a direct instruction now from everything you
heard from the biblical scholars that you have
interacted with.
This is an impossibility.
Right?
But in their own text, they talk about Christing
somebody's eyes.
And what, you know what that last, you're going to
love this, Danny.
This is going to blow your mind.
The last two words are Hina blepes.
And you know what that means?
It means in order that you may see.
It's exactly what I told you in the interview.
Exactly word for word.
I didn't make that up.
It's not an argument of mine.
I was just quoting a text.
Why do you think it is poetic?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why do you think it is that they are that they are so
this is the drugs are so off the Christian radar?
I mean, I think some of the stuff you talk about,
especially when it comes to the drugs and the
trafficking and just the sick and twisted lifestyle.
These people lived in antiquity.
It's so alien to modern morality.
And I think people have a problem when people are high
up in social institutions or they have peers they look
up to that they believe they're going to think they're
judged for talking about this stuff or acknowledging
this kind of stuff.
I feel like people just they they are afraid of getting
shunned from their pack.
They want to stay a part of their group.
And I bet you it probably interests a lot of them,
but they just they just they're afraid they're too
worried about their careers to touch this stuff.
So hey, I think that's it.
I think that's what it is.
I can vouch for the career thing.
Definitely.
Definitely.
Yeah, you can.
There's a certain ceiling that, you know,
academia builds that you really can't go beyond it.
Listen to the analysis, Satanic congregation.
Go play that back of what Danny just said.
Go play it back.
Perfect.
That comes from the temple of reason.
Right.
You see how it's there.
It's native patient one has that native.
That native reasoning.
Right.
That's why the inoculation of the antichrist is so
effective.
Okay.
I'm going to have one more.
I know you got to go.
I just want to show you.
