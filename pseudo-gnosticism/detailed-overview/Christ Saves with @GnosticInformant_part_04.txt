Fourth century
Late fourth century, early third century
BC
There are three centuries away from each other
He cites Hecateus of Abdera
You know what he says?
He says
Egyptians use the term
Ammon
Not just for one god
But for any of the gods
And they use it as a form of address
To close an incantation
He says the word
Amen
It comes from the god
Ammon
Who is the representative of the cosmos itself
The hidden one
So when you call amen to somebody
You're calling to the hidden one
Plutarch cites Hecateus of Abdera
Who he says
Told them all this
By the way, before Hecateus of Abdera
Nobody ever uses amen
In any sources
Ever
Right, so you
There's no ugeritic text that say amen
After a prayer
You know who's lips
Produce
Ammon
Over and over and over again
Jesus the Christ baby
Yo, you get it
He's in there
You got it
Perfect entry
To tonight's talk
Thank you Neil
I'm going to pull you off
And if you want to come back later
Feel free everybody
Take a look at Neil's interview
With Danny Jones
Love it
Satan brother
Hit the
Slides for me
People want to dive in deep tonight
And I want to start here
Oh god, I want to start it
Does that mean do they have to do something every time I say that
Are you ready?
Oh nox
Puthonus Medeon
Hecatebolemante
Oh god
What was that you just said
Oh
Nox
Oh lord
Of pytho
You who rule
Who strike from afar
You were mantic
What are we doing?
Oh god
We're addressing
God
Okay, I wanted to bring you that
Because that's the introduction that we've got
What is this from?
This is the Orphic Argonautica
Okay, the Orphic Argonautica
And people will debate the dates
The fact is we don't know
And linguistically
Some people will argue this thing has to be later
It has to be in the Ana Domini range
Some people say
Look, it's Orphic
And it's probably 5th, 4th century
BC
Right, so okay
Does it matter where it falls?
Sure it does
Evidence-wise, it matters where it falls
But what we're going to do
Is we're going to glean
Tonight we're going to glean from the vocabulary
And I'm going to show you some things that you'd never
You didn't think
You didn't think
I want you to look at that third word
In the middle of there
Medeon
That's where we're going to get the Medusa
This is addressing
Apollo
The Pythian Lord
The Pythian Wanox
What's a Wanox?
A Wanox is a Bronze Age
Um
Chief
Bronze Age Chief
This is at a time when you have Chiefs
And you have
Potnia
You have Queens
Chiefs and Queens
And Apollo
Is one of them
And he's the one who shoots from afar
The Mantic one
Who
Works on this
Go Chewie hit the next one
Watch this people
What is the Medeon?
Oh god a guardian
A ruler
You thought Medusa was
Guardian
These are priests
A guardian ruler
Always Zeus
Fantastic
Ruling from Ida
Which is the rulership
They use it of Apollo
If you just keep going down
Who they're going to be using it for
And then you get to number two
The Feminine Formedusa
That is just a part of
People of the verb
Medo
This is a Greek thing
I'm going to take you back
People have been asking
The surprise tonight
The Anunnaki
Okay
Oh goodness
We get to see
