The problem is the classical philologists are the professionals with the classical texts
You should be able to throw a classical philologist
Anything from Homer, throw him a little bit of Tacitus
How about some Juvenile?
Do you know how to do meter between both languages?
Those are the people that you consult
What's weird in this universe
The watchers still haven't figured it out
But what's really weird here
Is that those experts are experts in everything but the Bible
And the Septuagint included when I say Bible
Yeah
And do you know why?
Let me just tell you, as a former prof myself
You do not want to risk the engagement
Because a classical philologist, I'm just telling you this tonight
A classical philologist can tear your BS apart
Because for every second that you have read
They have read millions
It is their life
They have devoted themselves to this sacred space
So when you pull out Philo, that's what the seminarians do
That's what the religious schools do
And look, my children
When these people in trench coats come to you
They're going to open that trench coat
They're going to open it up
With a big seminarian smile on their face
They're going to show you the twins
Josephus and Philo
And you're going to gag on those twins
You're going to gag on them
What I recommend you do
Because the people at the time said
Hey, you know that guy Josephus
He's making up sources
Right?
That's a huge problem
This all culminates, people
Please understand me why this is so important
This all culminates
In Julian the Apostate, we call him
Julian the Apostate
Who made a decree
Nobody can teach classics
Who's an atheist
Interesting
And why would that be Julian?
Because they corrupt the text
It's their intention
In establishing their own fake history
Do you mean this is about power?
This is about power
Essentially about a power grab
Oh yeah, what do you think those humans do?
Aren't you guys the apesco boy?
Aren't you the ones who are watching all of this go around?
Oh god, let's hit some text
Let's purify it
Here's the vampire
I want to purify us now with the vampire
