And what did she do?
She wrote a notes.
She wrote notes or a synopsis of these mathematical works
of diophanties.
Okay, cool, cool, cool.
And something on astronomical.
Yeah, something about astronomy.
Yeah, and also Apollonius, right?
Apollonius, she wrote again some notes on that.
And what did she do?
She was killed by the Alexandrians and her body, right?
Was grossly maltreated, cut up, spread through the city.
Yeah, and she suffered this.
He says, duto de peponte.
She suffered this, why?
Dia phonon, phonon, phonon, you atheists won't understand this.
Phonon, you atheists won't understand this.
Phonon, give me the next, give me the Greek for phonon.
Yeah, what is it?
Ill will or malice, yeah, little bit of jealousy.
Little bit of jealousy, little bit of grudging feeling.
Why?
Why did they grudge this woman?
What could she possibly begrudge them?
Bring it back up.
Well, it's because of her wisdom.
Most especially, you know,
because of the incredible astronomical knowledge.
Take it down.
What a bunch of dogs.
What a bunch of, I can't even say.
I love dogs too much.
Yeah, I don't know what kind of animal acts that way.
I don't, but I do know that that animal
is traditionally carrying a cross
or an eight pointed star
or a crescent moon.
And usually somebody's getting enslaved in the process
and it's typically women.
Those sisterhoods of the frustration,
I know you, I know where you are.
Yeah, yeah.
Hypatia, what beauty, right?
You notice I didn't read to you.
There's descriptions of her
and how she looked and all that stuff.
All right.
But what was beautiful about Hypatia
is that her understanding of the cosmos
was so superior that it made people hate her for it.
People who followed Yahoo.
Yeah.
When you take a polytheistic society
in which justice thrives,
when you take that society
and give a third of the people power over everyone else,
that third can turn that society upside down.
They don't have to be a majority.
And that's exactly what the Christians did.
And what the Christians haven't taken over the Romans, right?
Having taken over the empire
and having mismanaged it so poorly
that it was falling apart.
Yeah.
Yeah, more additional war.
Nice.
Good job.
Having done all of that,
there had to be built some kind of facade of scholarship.
And that scholarship came through the Masoretic sect
which provided that source that we didn't have.
It finally solidified that this language
is the language of God.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's how history is built and that's where you are.
But we're going back to that original.
Tonight I had a couple.
I think I had one or two more things,
but I wanted you to see,
I wanted us to end with the resurrection of that vampire
that Baudelaire is talking about.
Yeah, she that Baudelaire,
who Baudelaire is talking about.
Yeah.
These are the texts, people.
If you would like to refute,
if you would like to critique,
or as some of the comments said, to debunk.
If you would like to debunk any of those texts,
feel free about it.
Yeah, go ahead.
But if you notice tonight, guys, all I did,
all I did was bring you texts.
This is what Bible studies will die from
when classes stand up,
master those texts and bring you the beauty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's the way.
We build that museum.
We build that museum.
Thank you guys for giving me so much time tonight.
I'm not going to take any more of your time.
It's an honor.
Hail Satan.
There down the fences that fence us all in.
Fences created by such evil men that we could.
There down the fences that fence us all in.
Maybe we could walk together again.
Just maybe we could walk together again.
