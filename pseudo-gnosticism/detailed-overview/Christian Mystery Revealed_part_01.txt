And let's go
Hit it
Where are we?
We're in the beginning
Of the apocalypse
Apocalypse
Yesu Christu
Heine edukenaultoi hothios
You know what we're bringing tonight?
We're bringing the apocalypse
Of the Christ
Of the Christ
Are you ready?
This is for us
This is for us
Give me the next one
What's going to happen?
That was the opening
Here is the word
For those of you who are taking the Greek
I want you to appreciate it
Apocalypse
There is no dash
They're just trying to show you
Where the prefix is
And where the root is
Et cetera, et cetera
This is a hiding
Oppo is taking that hiding away
You are bringing something to light
When you stand in that mystery temple
It says, know yourself
This is the revelation
Are you ready?
Give me the next one
We got to go right in
Watch here, people
Here is the apocalopto
Okay, fine
To disclose and to reveal
I just want you to see
I'm not lying to you
Hit me with the next one
Mm, fantastic
What is an actual apocalopsis
If you turn it into a noun
I want you to notice
It's an uncovering of something
It can be uncovering of different things
Tonight, I'm going to uncover
For you the right
Are you ready?
Look at that second line
Especially of divine mysteries
Oh, my God
Mystery, what is a mystery?
Hit them
They don't know this
Hit them
Musterion
Musterion
Here it is
Here it is
Love it, people
The Greek people
We're taking the Greek right now
Reading through Unit 1
Mu, Upsilon, Sigma, Tao, Eta, Rho, Yoda
Omicron, Nu
Musterion, Accent over the Eta
Oh, God
Isn't it gorgeous?
Just to say it
Musterion
Musterion
What is that?
Musterion
Well, really
Look at the parentheses at the top
Here's our musterion
Look at the parentheses
That's what they're hiding from you
Right?
That's what really counts
Those two words and parentheses
Particularly the second one
Mueo
Why?
Because I told everybody
Everything is coming from the verb
In ancient Greek
That's the verb
And what is that word
What is that verb going to do?
I'll show you in a second
But look here
Mystery of secret right
Mystery of secret
The mystery is in the plural
And then I want you to see
At the end of that line
The mystery is first in Heraclitus
Who, you say?
The hell is Heraclitus
Oh, I love this
Bring out the dead
Bring out the dead
Come on, Heraclitus
Oh, vigorous
Vigorous butte scenes
Will be on display
It's fantastic
Who is Heraclitus?
He is a pre-secratic philosopher
Who blows people's minds
I told you
I told you
Give him some images
Making him crazy
I told you
That there is this power
Of ancient Greek
In the right position
Which is in your brain
That power can bring itself out
In the logos
This guy was flying on the logos
Remember, remember
He's the guy who says things
