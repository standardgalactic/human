That nobody really understands
Nobody really understands
It's too much
Heraclitus
And you say, wait a minute
Why am I bringing the revelation
With Heraclitus?
Because this is the place
That the theologians cannot go
They cannot track the language
And that's what we're here to do
The Tower of Babel only works
If Mother Greek says so
You're gonna love it tonight
Watch this
Give me the next one
Oh, God, it's sizzling
It's sexy
Sexy mute
Chewy, get us to there
Come on, get us to there
Wait, was that it?
Are you sure?
Look, I wanted you to see here, people
Look at this
Look at what I do for you
Look at what I do
This is a text from the 19th century
It's Galen
It's Galen
Look at how beautiful that paper is
That paper is a couple hundred years old
You know, when that stuff is new
It looks just like this
Isn't that gorgeous?
Look at how it doesn't age
It's immortal, baby
They made immortal paper
In the 1820s to the 40s
Oh, God, let's go
Look at the people
I said mystery, right?
So I wanted to take you to a place Dan isn't?
You know, this is just a place
A place to dance and the kips to the world
They can't go because they're training
You know, it just falls
It just falls a little short
Right? You know, there's samurai
And then there are people who stay there, samurai
And how do you know when they get in an arena?
You can see
It's skill
Watch this, people
This is Galen
That's in the very middle of the page
In the new paragraph
This is Ale, an odunos to musterion
Not only is the word Christos
Or Christ a drug term
But in antiquity
They are so cheeky
That they name powerful
Compound drug
The mystery
Oh, my God
Somebody would tell me
Some scholar somewhere
Ah, right on it
Backside
Some scholar somewhere
Is going to say
There is no association between a mystery and drugs
And you want to squeeze
There are little heads like this
Like just like that
Right? Why?
Oh, God
The gospel is a drug term
Salvation is a drug term
She dusts his robe
Oh, God
Here we go
Go back to the sources
Bring up the next one
There was your drug formula, by the way
For those of you, your Greeklings
Who are reading and studying
I recommend that you go to that text
Just flash that text up
It's got a recipe for the drug
That you call the mystery
Oh, that's fantastic
Past the bull's blood
Let's go
You didn't know they had this kind of stuff, did you?
But they did
Here's the verb
To initiate into the mysteries
Now, I want to make a point here
Dan McClellan, the world-renowned theologian
Bible scholar
Just all around, you know, champion
Champion, did you see the plaques on his walls?
Oh, my God, he's got plaques
Woo!
Dan McClellan says, amen
Merely went to the bottom of the definition
Okay, now, what does that show?
It shows poor inadequate training
He's not trying to be this way
He's being this way because his trainers
Didn't have the skill level with the language
That they could raise him up to the level
That he can use a basic tool
Like a classical Greek lexicon
Yeah, so if you track the word
Through this passage, you see how it's set up?
All in blue, you've got all the Greek and blue
Who are the mysteries about?
Gives you all the different mysteries
And all the different contexts that you've got
And then you get to definition number two
It says generally to teach, you're an instruct
Now, if I jump down and I choose definition number two
It's not because that has nothing to do
With the rest of the word
If you track these passages
You will see what does it mean to Mueo
