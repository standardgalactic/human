right if i'm going to translate this is number 34 if they do not
what if they do not what if they do not bring the hymn and the procession to diagnosis along
with the song and celebration of the i do you i see what is that i do on means
private parts you mean we hymn the private parts in barkic religion yes and what is it
what does it say it then goes on to say and what what do they do they put people into mania
and they put them into the lanayan ecstasy wait a minute these are drug terms right yes
these are cult associated terms that indicate a change in mental behavior a change in mental
perception a change in an understanding of reality
okay um what does plutaric says at the bottom he says hey on ox lord lord of the oracle that is
in delphi he speaks right and what happens oh i'm sorry i'm sorry he doesn't speak and he doesn't
hide but he say my name he signifies he seals he seals and signifies that's what the lord of
the oracle does and remember the first jewish religious structure is a telestarian it's an
oracle producing tent this is talking about the origins of everything that is
judaism everything and in turn what christianity developed marvelous did you know judaism and
christianity i don't know if judaism and christianity would like to be would like to
know this about themselves but they were born from the same parents
isn't that neat isn't that neat i don't know if everybody would like that or not
but um whether you like it or not they're codependent right and when we have people translating
greek texts into hebrou just to say we've got original hebrou texts the christians have to
prop that up right or else they both fall short right and the pagans were just just no just whatever
don't try to tear that on the government we don't care give me the next one
boom lastly what is he oh no there was a there was a message and there we go watch this what is
plutarx say plutarx the priest by the way mm-hmm what are you apollo you're one who neither speaks
nor do you hide but you signify you seal now watch this go to the next one why does that
matter you think oh this stuff is not there oh before we get there one more one more we'll
see the signifying a second but watch what happens i'm just going to translate this for the one and
you see the two daggers in that first line after the number six those two daggers mean a something
goofy and it's a little bit hard to um to translate it right but there for the one who is they will be
raised again to become guardians guardians of the living and of the dead
oh okay that was heraclitus people if you want to understand the apocalypse and you have not read
pre-socratic philosophy you're going to miss maybe 60 percent of the vocabulary right away
you're not even going to know what that vocabulary is for we are squarely sitting in a mystery
initiation we're in the cult and these words this is the evidence of the crime scene
let's do it let's do it it's too bad the theologians don't ever catch up but they don't typically
they don't um it's the faith thing right it's the same reason sisters of frustration never become
fulfilled it's the faith it's the faith and you do it because of your fear you're afraid of hell
but watch what's going to happen to hell i'll show you what we're going to do to hell are you ready
give me the next one watch this and uh um witness yeah who is just jesus christ look at the second
line he's that firstborn what is he the firstborn of now you think about the he's the firstborn of
god right no no he's not he's not theologically that may match what you'd like but he is not he is the
the only born of god am i reaching yeah not yet it'll come it'll come we'll get there um
sorry did you set that when you can't okay let's go what is he he's the firstborn ton necron
the you hear you know necro in there and you know it has to do with dead necrophilia man necron
corpses right people who have deceased who have died he's the firstborn of the dead did you know
that was jesus christ's title it was his cult title firstborn of the dead of course he had to
resurrect right because he's the firstborn of the dead and what else king of these kings right of
course he is give me the next one that word that word is very important and you cannot dismiss it and
say uh the cults are using the same terms uh but the christians yeah something's different you know
think about christianity this way this is how christians see their own history right um
gaius woke up one morning and went and listened to a preacher and maybe it was peter right right
after he killed ananias and sapphira for their money and he's sitting out there listening to him
and he's like oh this stuff really makes sense and i don't want to go to hell so i'm gonna i'm
gonna follow this to wherever it goes now all of my words are not going to be what they were before
i am not going to use pagan ideas i am not going to use pagan words magically i am going to speak
those pagan words but they will have christian meanings because of my faith is that what you
want you want faith here come here come here you're going to hell you're going to hell
what's happening give me the next one i think i've taken us into a different place
is there a dimensional rift somewhere in here
hmm and what are we now we're priests man we are priests glory and power into the ions of ions says
the christian into the ions of the ions do you even know what that means do you think the person
sitting there in church this weekend ho ho ho making their symbols feeling their prayers oh
jesus forgive me these three times this week i saw patty next door oh god i wish you wouldn't wear
what she's wearing oh it's the spirit of the devil can you forgive me lord jesus you know
they're praying like that right right um and do you think that they understand what the expression
does dan i challenge you i challenge you dan what does it mean into the ions of ions dan will say
from his seminary training oh that's the word for eternal like eternal life dan dan and all you
theologians out there what the heck does it mean to say into the eternities can you really have a
plural eternity isn't eternity already everything how can you have two everything's isn't the one
everything also the other everything when you say eternal life when you walk into that church today
and that preacher is up there that misogynist guy is up there and he's like oh you need to repent
you need to repent of your crimes because you are the Sodom and Gomorrah of the modern world
you need to repent praise jesus he'll forgive you all your sodomistic ways
Gomorrah tendencies you got them not me right um that person do you think that person really
understands the concept of a plurality of ion i don't think so but you as an initiate
you have ionic vision you know what your completion is you've experienced your
completion and thanks to that christ the first person who was ever referred to as having
been a christ thank you diogenes for showing us this not diogenes um diodorus syculus thank
you diodorus who by the way is continues about a hundred years before jesus yeah so the terminology
is there and he's referring to the first christ and it turns out it's the woman who gave us salvation
whose name means medicine
she is the prototype and that's why jesus is now wearing her golden bra do you see
the monism of judaism and the monism of christianity are replacements of a sacred
feminine voice i'll say that one more time the monism of judaism the monism of christianity
are the direct offspring of lady babelon now you understand why they don't want to come out
of the closet now you understand what happens what happens when your world is tipped upside down
you don't worry you're disoriented you just have to accept breathe breathe the reality take a breath
breathe the reality give it give me the next one give me the next one what is
it's not working too forget about it i'm just gonna have to exist in this zone of blueness
yeah this is into the ions of ions let's go on people are like you know what i need to climax
here i need some kind of crescendo to something that oh we got the purple bag give it to me hey
pay attention he's coming in the clouds now that's what you know people would say what the
it's a kind of a nice picture they'll draw it with jesus and he's oh he's in the clouds
right and he's coming it doesn't say in the clouds though it says with the clouds
says with the clouds in all fairness i'll let you theologians figure that out but when you're
surrounded by clouds every eye can see him and especially those who pricked him who wait what
those who pricked him they put the people theologians will say oh it's referring to crucifixion
no it's not no it's not there's no crucifixion in this word there's no crucifixion give me the
next one give me the next one there is no crucifixion in this word what is in it oh here's the clouds
here's the clouds let's go on from the clouds look at that the bottom one is nice the alchemical
sublimate isn't that neat call those clouds ah didn't i here is the verb that it's from people
kente oh and it's just got an intensifier on the front of it so it's like really really kente oh
and what do you do when you kente oh something you sting it you sting it do you remember paul
what does paul have he's got that stinging in his sox oh my flesh pastor please jesus christ save me
save me pastor from this stinging flesh he asked god three times give it to me this dude paul
who is immune to viper venom ask god three times please don't let me continue to do this and god
said to him shut up my grace is sufficient my strength is multiplied in weakness
ostenea is the word in greek in weakness when you go under you will find ostenea
you will be unable to move and this is necessary to bring you to death
do you see why god allowed paul to continue
there was a great city in antiquity called thebes some of the some of the best things
in the world came out of thebes like the worship of Dionysus and the grave of his mother
the son of god yeah yeah and where did that brilliance come from came from baskets they carried
around with serpents and medical applicators for rectal administration of drugs do you know
who founded the city of thebes
was a singer and he did it with the teeth of the dragon the teeth of the dragon
the teeth of the dragon are what you need to enter into the mystery you must be stung and
that is why yahoo's grace is sufficient please please yahoo take this away from me take this
boy cup away from me nevertheless not my will but yours be done that city was founded through
those practices that involved the seven stars that i hold in my hand
if you are ever if you are ever on the verge of death hold up the serpent
raise up the serpent undertake the work of the serpent
you'll drink that death inducer says jesus and it will do nothing to you
do you know what jesus the one product was that jesus christ endorsed in the bible
it's not any sort of chariot it's not any sort of accounting abacus
it's not any sort of drugs that you can buy in the roman marketplace
the one thing he endorsed was a drug that only the mystery initiates will have
experienced these are people who were born again and jesus christ said you will use these drugs
and they will not hurt you okay what are you doing if you come over to my place and i've
got my 12 children and we're doing our initiations we're oh apostles are children right students
