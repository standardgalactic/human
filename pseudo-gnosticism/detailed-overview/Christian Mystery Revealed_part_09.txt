anyway um i say children they can be teenagers too so um you know somewhere in that range
students and um if i'm there with my 12 students maybe i'm washing their feet
so i've already taken off my clothes and um the little towel that i wrapped around my private
parts i'm gonna as i wash the foot and then dry it i'm gonna take that towel off and i'm gonna wash
that foot right in front of myself totally totally naked right what's john looking at while
you're washing his foot hmm you'll ask yourself the question have these people done it and the
answer is the ones that are born again have been sunk in death and resurrected those are the true
believers those are the true um if you're not willing to enter into death and resurrection
you're never going to make it through the right you're never going to make it there's too much
fear involved there if you fear for your life that much you're not going to be able to do this
yeah unless we hold you down do it forcefully to you but you know although you could argue
they're doing that at the cave atrophonias and because they just drop you in there and then
you're around the snakes and you're on the hallucinogen and you know next thing you know
you're screaming there's no way out it's totally pitch black dark you could argue that that's really
not voluntary kind of but you have to be willing if you are a christian and you love jesus christ
you'll love the christing you'll understand what it is and you'll follow that what we
have today with theology the apocalypse tonight is showing us we don't have what we used to
this is not christianity is not the mystery religion at once was judieism is not the
religious mystery that it once was yeah yeah we have to reconcile the fact that our
conceptions of our own past are not the reality this is the mystery for you to look into that
mirror and for you to see i am not what i thought i was
you're awake and unafraid that's what they used to say about it this person now who's been
initiated is awake and unafraid oh god is that gorgeous give me the next one we need to we need
to um touch off here people are people are like oh my god the texts are endless let's finish up
right okay um skip this one i want to go quick this is the yep there's the biting and i just want
yep fine that's the stinging right the stinging um here's some bees and wasps for you that's great
give me the next one um it also what is that stinging associated with bineo which means to
in ire and what does it mean to in ire why did they translate this into latin because
they were um victorian prudes and to in ire literally means to go into um to enter into someone
you know what i'm talking about um to co ire to enter into it together right as a as a pair
right look who it refers to right away we get aristophanies right oh that's nice
passively it's used of the woman are we getting closer right do you understand where that sting
comes from do you understand right okay i've been stung let's get it let's get it that's
literally what it says and here's paul i just want to skip to the end here's i noticed on the third
line down angelo satana who is paul when paul is doing his drugs he's on the venom and he's got the
star what does he do what what happens he's entering into a place where he gets an angelo
and the the the title of these angelo is pantocrator pantocrator who's this one satana
who's paul called who's paul's personal angel you didn't know this you didn't know satan
was paul's personal angel when he said he got to the third heaven and he was like oh i don't know
if it was actually there or not right right i don't know whether it was just an illusion
or or whether it was a reality i don't know whether i was physically there i don't know
right people listen to paul the apostle and they they talk about him like he's the biggest
brain on the planet let me tell you something you put paul the apostle next to an epaminides
and he's gonna crush him they both quoted the same thing by the way they both quoted medea
both paul and epaminides quoted medea all cretins are liars right uh
he couldn't hold a candle paul couldn't hold a candle you remember what he said
he said i was in that state
i don't know if i was in my body
but i was in that heaven right whatever level that he went to because there's different levels
and you look at me you'd be like that's now first of all the the person of faith will say
i can see how that could be the person of not faith would be like what the hell does that mean
right what do you mean there's different levels apparently apparently when you go through the
death process and are brought back by these drugs apparently you can access and see the structure
there's a divine structure to the cosmos ruled by daimones oh my god are you kidding me
no and he's talking about that vision people used to say you mean there's drugs in the new
testament oh my god um where are there not drugs when you're using a term like christ which is a
drug term paul is going up dude that guys they noticed this dude is is is um by the way this is
the perfect question to ask next time you're with one of your one of your um honest friends
you know and maybe they start talking about praise this and praise that um ask them why is paul
immune to venom immune to snake venom is there something funny why is jesus telling people
hey you can use venom and it won't hurt you are you guys a part of a drug cult
the answer is yes give me the last we're going to go to this last i wanted you guys to see
the title almond is your mind an apple of disparities garden that's gorgeous who said that
it was calzone is gorgeous gorgeous love it oh yeah oh yeah who's that apple for by the way
right eyes are open eyes are open you want the fruit god was a total liar everybody knows yahu's
a liar right what did he say you eat that fruit you're going to die you're going to die mom satan
says no how are you not going to die no your eyes are going to be open much the contrary you're
going to see things like he does like they do the divinities do did you know they're plural
you're going to see things like the gods yeah and you'll be naked right and sure enough that's
you know sure enough you know devil's word was good why you know it's to sit in that position
to sit in that position and guard that fruit if he was ugly would have been much better he should
have picked the ugliest angel he knew alfred the ugly anglo-saxon angel that's who he should have picked
right to guard that fruit she would have looked at alfred and been like oh god right now it was the
devil and he was the best looking what do you think go what a dummy yahu is dumb he's just plain
out dumb if a full third of your own people decide that you're dumb and they follow the
good-looking dude who seems to have his act together by the way kane is not adam's child

that right teletai that completion that initiation bringing in the ostenae right you ever seen

nature and if you look down on the left hand side you're going to see the one two three fourth line
down panto kratera do you know who nature is she's urania you mean she's venus yes and do you do you
know what they called her they called her the same thing that the jews and christians
called their divinity they took her title which was already established and they reworked it
