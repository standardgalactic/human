of that muse
that classical voice
You should be thanking me
and allowed to be here
because none of us are worthy of that voice
That's a pure
and gorgeous
That's right, stay back
Dragon says, stay back
First one steps over the line
You get the arrow
Oh, God
Give it to me, go ahead, Chewie
Hit me with that first source
Hermes, what are you going to tell us, Hermes?
Look, the guy didn't want to stay here
Right?
He's some kind of tyrant
He's some kind of tyrant
Right?
And what's happening?
The things that he's saying
Oh, my God, he's wanting to leave
and go back for
you know, for Eudaimonia
He's missing his Eudaimonia
He's missing his what?
He's missing that
prosperity
He's missing his prosperity
Number one, arrow
Hit it, give me the next one
Do you people want to see
Oh, do you people want to see
what this guy's name is?
Right?
His name is Great Misery
Megapenthes
And he is
Turanis
And what is that? The word tyrant
is a Greek word
The word tyrant
Everybody after Mother Greek came along
borrowed it
and said, huh, what a great invention
The festivals
in Athens
that are meant to purge society
Those are
festivals in which I go
and watch somebody get
possessed
Right? Tell the people who are acting today
Break down that fourth wall
You got to be possessed or it doesn't work
People who are
possessed bring you
the tyrant
People who are possessed
And why would you want to go watch that?
Besides all the good food and everything
Why would you want to go watch that?
Because it'll purge you
It'll cleanse you
and our democracy will be stronger
Do you understand?
This is for the deems
Yeah
Neighborhoods
Give me the next one
Oh God, what is this? What's happening?
So here we've got the spirit
of the tyrant
And we're taking his spirit to hell
And he's trying to get away
He's trying to get away
Right? And they're collecting
All the souls are being collected
and put onto the boat where
Keron is
And what kind of souls?
We got babies
And we got old people
Isn't that something? We got babies
And they're all like fresh grapes
And then we got old people
This is what
The Moirai are saying
This is what they're saying
Of the people
The souls that they're collecting
Look, you got young ones, you got old ones
You got ones that are killed by tyrant
You got a couple of those
You got ones that are killed by
Leistai
By pirates
It's a wonderful little look
At the anthropology
What's going on?
Yeah, what are your death rates about?
Well, let's see
Give me the next one
So here we are, we've got our tyrant with us
We've got our tyrant with us
And Clotho says, look people
Bring me the people who've been judged
By the courts, I want them
I want the people
Who have been beaten
And the ones that have been tortured
Right? And I want the ones that the
Pirates
That the Leistai, those guys
They're involved
Where are they Hermes, right?
So we're collecting souls
We're collecting souls
Wait, the tyrant is coming
Just wait, you'll see, give me the next one
And what happens?
What happens?
A little guy named Puppy Man
Right? Cuniscos
Right? Puppy Guy comes up
Puppy Guy is a cool guy
Right? And why is that?
Listen to him, listen to him speak
Remember, this is a soul
Speaking to the powers
Of the cosmos
And what does this
Soul say?
Says, look, I've been standing
Next to you, you know
You best of goddesses
Clotho, right? That's your name
I've been standing here next to you
You have given me a life
That's, you know, I don't deserve
What you've given me, the length of time
That you've spread out for me
Give me the next one
And Clotho is like
Look, look, he's like
Why'd you do that? You didn't have to do that
And she says, don't you love it
Isn't that tender and beautiful
And what does she say to him?
Look, I've made things this way
So that you could be an overseer
And a doctor to these
Humans who do such
Bad things
So
Get on the boat and
Good fortune to you, brother
Right? That's what
That's how the soul is
Interacting. Now wait
We're gonna look in the mirror
Where's that timer? Give me the next one
We gotta search down that timer
I'm gonna jump to it, right?
Pretty quick tonight
Because I want you to see
What you are doing
Because
That's the power of the muse
Okay? The power to
Look into that mirror
What does that little puppy guy
Say? You know, he's a good guy
I like him. He ends up in a good place
Right? But
He says
Well, you see, there's no verb in that sentence
Yeah, there is. It's invisible
Isn't Greek amazing? Anyway
It says, look, this guy mega-penthies
That is the dude who is
Super miserable
He's a tyrant. Here he comes
He's the guy who's been causing so much trouble
Hermes had to go running after him
Give me the next one, please, Chewie
Hermes had to go running after him
What is it that he
Keeps trying to get back
That he was taken away at death
