He's trying to get his
Prosperity, his good fortune
His opulence
Okay? His
Opulence
The tyrant
Is chasing
The opulence
Give me the next one, tyrants chasing
The opulence
Let's see, let's keep going
What does the
Moira say to him?
She says
For what sake
For what sake did you come here?
And he says
Mega-penthies says
Um
I went to the
Hang on
Oh, yeah
For what sake
Would you have me
Send you back
And he says, for the sake of
Completing
My mansion, baby
My house is only
Well, it's not finished
Right?
It's only half-finished
Right?
Half-completion
And I haven't
Built it, right?
He's got a mansion
Down somewhere, I don't know
Maybe it's in Florida, it's not done
It's not finished
That's why he's asking to go back
And she's like
Why the hell do you want to go back?
Give me the next one
And what does the tyrant say
Day-race
Day-race
One word, watch this power
Of the Greek, give me the next slide
One word
Here it is
This is actually from Laodos
Trash
Trumpery
I told you, there was Trump
Buried in this, I didn't put in there
Do you understand?
Here's our trumpery
What are you doing?
You're running after
That which is showy
But is useless
What is the tyrant?
Love
More than anything, you mean
The Greeks are not managing tyrants
Based upon their political party
And their affiliation
And whether they're an ism or that
Or this left or right
Or liberal or conservative
No, they're not
The number one test
For a tyrant
Is greed
Is greed
You want that luxury, don't you?
You want that luxury
You see, the Greeks were scientific
Very scientific people
They invented the scientific method
Thank goodness they did
Or you and I would be traipsing around in bogs
Yes
How do you tell a tyrant?
Number one
Is that tyrant
A servant of greed
Is that tyrant's a servant of greed?
Are you looking into the mirror
At the tyrant?
Are you a servant of greed?
Is that your thing?
Oh god
Now, why is that so?
Why is that particularly so bad?
Because you see, I hate to say this
But I'm gonna go ahead and interject
Here, something. I'm sitting with the watchers
The other day watching
We were talking about the court
Bring up that court
We were talking about the court
That finally gave
This one
That finally gave
Complete and
Total power
To a mortal
We're talking about that court
And I said, do you see
Thomas sitting there with his big smile
On? Do you know why?
I said this to a watcher
I said this to a watcher
I said, do you know why he's sitting there with a big smile?
Because he
Is going on vacation
He's going on vacation
He's gonna take the billionaire's vacation
He's gonna do it
Mmm
The watchers don't find that stuff funny
They don't find it funny because
That's how you lose justice
Once you put a mortal
Above
Everybody
You're safe as long as
That mortal is still underneath justice
Right?
This is a unified people
We are all
Equal under the law
We are all equal
And when you're most corrupt
Court
In supreme court history
Nobody has gotten
The millions upon millions
That these people have
What happens
Justice leaves
We're not concerned about
Whether or not anybody's going
To get justice
What we're concerned about now
Is finding out what is a tyrant
What is a tyrant
Greed
Greed, always the mark of the tyrant
Always the mark of the tyrant
And when I say greed
I'm talking about
Ancient
Desire
For that which is going to elevate
You
I'm talking about, look dude
If I give you
This speech
You accept
And repent of your sins
You're gonna get eternal life
That kind of exchange
Is a greed
Based exchange
You wouldn't
Be going to heaven
Unless there was something that you were gonna do
Right? You're gonna get
I'm gonna give over
My brain to this virus
And I'm gonna perpetuate this virus
And I'm gonna sit and be
Self delusional with this virus
Yeah, greed
You thought you knew ancient
Ethics didn't you? Shame on you
I have a sting for your
Buttices
Shame on you
You had no idea
What the ancient ethic was
You had no idea what
Mother Greed gave us
Greed
Do you see a commandment about
Thou shalt not be greedy?
Put it at the top
Put it at the top
