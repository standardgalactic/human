Clotho is
insisting that he get on the boat
For death
Right
That he needs to be transported
Across to the underworld
And he's insisting
And he just keeps
Trying to bribe her
Trying to do anything
To get out of it
Now what does he do
He's negotiating
He's negotiating
Because the tyrant
The negotiation
Even
When it's corrupt
Even when it's corrupt
The tyrant
Cannot
See in the mirror
That's why the bonk
Ecstasy
Is meant to force you to look into the mirror
What does he say here
What's the negotiation
I will give you
My wife
In my place
Will you take that
And of course she's like no
We don't do that
Because the books of accounting
For hell
Are so extensive
Everybody has to be accounted for
Down to the person
The unique individual
That is you
Every one of them
Again, this is the classical
Mind
At work
Nature is so
Perfect
She is so beautiful
Everything goes, the curves go right together
All the pieces
They just paw, they make this
Oneness, oh god
I turned down the mojo
Right
So our ultimate
Reckoning
That logos
Is
Always
Correct
You can't substitute
Somebody's actions for your actions
Your time has come
And the tyrant just doesn't
Want to face
That end
Give me the next one
The tyrant doesn't want to face that end
Boom
Here he is, what does he say
Yeah
Again, we're back to negotiating
Right
He says
At least do this for me
Tell me, I want to know
What is coming
What is happening
What's going to happen to my estate
And everything like that
You
Yeah, fantastic
All right, here we go
Now for those of you who are like
Hey, you shut up
I take the road
I don't take the information highway
I take the little tiny
Frontage road
That's got eight
NBPS baby
Hey, somebody's got to be classical
Here's mega penthees
What does mega penthees says
The tyrant says look
Please, just tell me
What's going to happen to my
In my estate
Everything I've worked for
All of that
Glory that I worked for
Give me the next one
Clotho says
Okay, here's what's going to happen
Your daughter
Is going to be handed over
To those prostitutes of power
Your daughter
Is going to be handed over
To those prostitutes
Of power
All of your images
Mr. Tyrant
All of your images and statues
They're going to throw those down
And they're going to laugh
Not at you
But at themselves
For having ever listened
To any of your junk
Yeah
Yeah
They're going to make
Looking in the mirror
Great again
That's what they're going to do
Why is she saying that?
Because that's how civilizations are
Right, the people at the time
You have to understand people at the time
Are fighting against the rise
Of tyrants
Whether it's a handful of them
Or whether it's one, it doesn't matter
And they have developed
Systems for dealing
With tyrants in the number one
Control
The number one control
Is the oracle
Is the oracle, did you know?
There's a group of oracles
Throughout the Mediterranean
There's a group of oracles
They work together
Uh-huh
They're the real power and antiquity
And I'm not the only one to say that
Right, they're the real power
The Bronze Age power and antiquity
And if you go to one of those oracles
As an official delegation
Of your town
And you present the question
What do we do with our orange nightmare?
She'll tell you
Exactly what to do
And you have the legal right
To go back
To your town
And to carry out her sentence
Amazing
Why would you give them
So much power
Because they hate
Tyrants
Something to do with that age, man
Something to do with that age
And those drugs they were on
The tyrants have to go
Can you see the unattractive nature
Of a tyrant?
Where is he? Where is he again?
Where is our guy? Get him looking in the mirror
Get him looking in the mirror
Come here!
There he is
Look at this image, people
For one second, look at the image
Who is attracted?
Who?
Who is attracted to this image?
You must be seeing something
That the rest of us aren't
There's something that is drawing you
Is it
The greed?
Is it the greed?
Is it
The superiority?
Is it the confidence?
Is it that power?
