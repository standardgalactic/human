Weaves those strands together
The quantum reality
She is always bringing irony
She's always giving you
Look at everything that happens in human affairs
And you can say, wow
What kind of lesson is that?
The least
Henry Cavill
On the planet
Is the one that you
Find attractive
You've got to ask yourself
Is it the tyranny?
Is that what it is?
Is it the tyranny? Look into the mirror
You don't know who you are
You don't know what kind of life you're living
Do you see
The only way
That I'm going to bring this to you
Is if it's a part
Of that classical song
And it very much is
We have giant festivals
To show you what a tyrant is
So we don't make this mistake
Of electing one
Of electing one
Interesting
Interesting
Now you thought
The definition of a tyrant would be some kind of
You know, somebody gets donations
And they have a power back
And they have their politics
No, no
Look at the greed
Look what happens
Give me the next one
Yeah, yeah
Tell me
This is the shoemaker again
And shoemaker and puppy guy
His name means puppy
They hit it off
They're two nice people
And they end up holding hands
When they get to the underworld
And they're like, this is the first thing
The shoemaker says, he says, wait a minute
Look, is it just me or doesn't
This look like
What they taught us
In the Ellis city and mysteries
Doesn't this look exactly
Like what we saw?
Yeah
Do you see? He's not afraid
The person who's been
Through the mystery
Knows and is not afraid
It's the reason they're born
Again, not because they're
Reaching for something
Eternal life, give me eternal life
Jesus Christ, give me eternal life
No
It's because they've seen it
Because they have been
Through the nourishing
Of the great mother
They know
Yeah
Is that why they're not greedy?
Hmm
Wouldn't that be funny? Wouldn't that be funny
If people would go through this right
Open up their eyes
Have an experience they write about
And say, my God, man
I wasn't even born
Before this happened
I know what life is now
And all of a sudden
They don't care about
Your money
Now, if your reputation
Is having gotten where you are
Because of your money
And your ability to make it
Do you know that is this
Un-American
That is as un-American as
Anything
We
Hate
Tyrants
Our ancestors fought
Tyrants
Yeah
Look
For which one
Is it sleepy?
Or is it
Mr. Greed
Golden
Golden
Toilet Greed
Golden toilet
You know what it costs to sit on a golden toilet
It costs a lot of people
Food
I know I'm a poor guy
And I work hard
So that I can eat
And it's getting harder and harder
Just to eat
And do you know what's happening
With
Mr. Mega Misery
He is crapping
On your food
That
Is a tyrant
That
Is a tyrant
That's a tyrant
Give me the next one
We're almost done
And grateful that you give me the time
That you
Have
So these two guys
They're making good friends
The shoemaker and what's his name
And they come up to the judge
This is Radamanthus
Radamanthus
And what does he say?
So who are you?
And he introduces himself
I'm Kniskos
I'm a little puppy guy
What am I?
I'm a philosopher
I'm a philosopher
He's a philosopher
Fantastic
You'll be glad you stayed
Because I'm about to show you what happens in hell
You ready? This is so cool
I don't know the physics of this
Somebody should make up
The physics of this
And put it into like a drama
Some kind of sci-fi
Okay, this is awesome
Let's go back to the one that we were just on
He says who are you?
And he says I'm dog man
And I'm a philosopher
Up here I use my nomad
You know what I mean? Go down
Give me the next one
He says but
Okay, Knisuke
Right? You gotta tell me something
Right? I'm gonna look
I'm gonna look
At you
For any
Stigmata
Wait what?
He's going to strip him
And he's going to look
For his tattoos
The ones that are on the souls
Of every mortal
Wait, every mortal
Got tattoos on their soul
Yes, again
Don't understand the physics
Let's see how those tattoos get there
Are you ready? Why do you think tattoos are so important?
Those magic words
Why do you think they're so important?
It's a reflection of
Reality
Beyond the event horizon
I love this stuff
