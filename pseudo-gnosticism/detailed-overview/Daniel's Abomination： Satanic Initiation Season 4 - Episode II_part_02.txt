exact same verbatim translation of a text that in Hebrew, they said they have, but
we don't have, doesn't exist.
Stop the magic.
Let's get the science going people and stop the magic.
This was right.
This stuff was written in Greek.
It's got Greek idiom in it.
Okay, so let's look at it and funny thing is, I'll give you one, one thing that will
make the evangelicals quite upset.
All the references to Christ have been scrubbed from it.
Yes.
All the references of Christ in the Septuagint were taken out by the gentle men and I'll put
my focus on the men, the gentle men of the 10th century, those, what did they call themselves?
They were sacked.
They were sacked trying to, they had one agenda and that was to make Hebrew the holy language,
right?
It's got to be the language of Jehovah that is the holy language and these Maserites,
they went ahead and they created a text in which they scrubbed any references to Christ.
Wow.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
Did you know that?
No, but we have the original text.
See, they couldn't, they couldn't erase it from history because the Septuagint is still
sitting there.
It's still there.
Let's go to the text.
Run to the Unix.
Remember, we're in the garden with Jesus all the time.
That is all this investigation is about to find out what he's doing in that garden with
that naked kid.
Let's go to our first passage.
This is Daniel.
Who is this now?
We're talking about Darius, who's the king of the Medes, that's what the text says.
King of the Medes.
In that door, right?
Caipano Basileos and the king says to his arch eunuch, his archi eonuchoi.
Oh my God.
Take that down.
What is it?
First of all, I didn't know there was eunuchs, much less arch eunuchs.
Yes.
Arch eunuchs.
Eunuchs are ranked.
What is a eunuch, you say?
I just want to repeat to you a little something that Guaza said in the 16th.
Yay.
Yay.
Yay.
Here it is.
What?
