the aporia, shh, the aporia, the aporia, don't say anything about it, right, now you know,
Mark, he's going to take that section of the gospel out, right, that talks about it, it's just
too much, right, this is something that you're going to scandalize, listen to what the head,
the head honcho said, the head trafficker said, he said you're going to scandalize us,
you're going to scandalize us, I tell you that the arrest warrant is getting longer and longer,
you know what I mean, we've got them down, this is pure racketeering, this is pure racketeering,
Jesus, the pirate, eunuch making, I wonder how many, how many eunuchs did Jesus make,
let's make it pull on, do you think Jesus made a few eunuchs, a lot of eunuchs or maybe eunuch
crazy, maybe he was just making them left and right, maybe that was part of the problem, right,
I mean we see at least a couple of them, the young boys and the in the cemeteries that are nude,
we see those guys, lots of eunuch boys, okay let's go back to our passage, I want to give you
guys just a couple of things, go ahead, remember for those of you who think now come on, this
delugma, this thing that we're translating is abomination, right, filthiness, this filthiness,
you're thinking this has nothing to do with little boys and having sex, run that clip again,
please, the abominations, we need to see that one more time. Now the subject of today's study
ah has an ominous sounding title, it is a very serious subject,
what is the abomination of desolation. The abomination of desolation, abomination of
desolation, the abomination of desolation, abomination of desolation, the abomination of
desolation, the abomination of desolation, the abomination of desolation, the abomination of
of desolation that desolation is the wilderness air remoses that place where you envision the
God that is where the abomination is it is that place where you envision the God fire the drug
it'll be established it'll be established as the proper form an older form of worship in the
he had on in the temple as the proper form of worship what does that have to do with intercourse
you being too dirty with Jesus and his boy and this thing about the abominations what is that
let's look let's look kitties let's look go ahead
she lady babelon has a golden cup in her hand and what is in that cup the abominations
and the off runnings of her poor nea of her intercourse of her temple worship and right and
on her forehead is a name and what is that name musterion musterion she is the mother
porno the mother of those prostitutive acts yes and i saw her
what is she she is wasted wasted high from the blood of the holy oh that cup is full of the
abominations the delugma that is full of her abominations of her sex act
now you think you wonder to yourself the reestablishment of this right is the end of
everything reestablishment of this right is the end of everything interesting what incredible fear
what incredible fear they had of this apparently enigmatic and amazing mystery performance
yes yes and now you know now you know why we have to get there with daniel if you want to have vision
you've got to go through that eunuch that good looking eunuch right and you have to bring that
eunuch to the place to the place of the eremon to the eremosis you've got to bring him there
and when he's in that place you'll have vision and that is what runs empires right these potentates
whether they're masculine or feminine ladies don't get all don't get all you know self righteous
because you're the ones who figure this stuff all out yeah it's all from feminine medicine
fingerprints are all over it it's all female medicine this is your art these sorcerers are
your sorcerers so does it make sense that you ladies would want to possess castrated boys
who can create vision yeah yeah castrated boys who can create vision you didn't think the great
mother frigy and mother you didn't think she cut off attis's testicles for no reason did you
right um this is artisanry this is craftsmanship this is brilliant what they're doing to the human
body is fantastic and the tax the tax reflect a level of technical skill level of technical skill
that is certainly beyond I don't believe we would have an ability in the modern world to
reproduce these rights properly I don't believe we'd be able to simply just based on the pharmacology
just based on the pharmacology right what a world it would be to open the water of life
right and to increase our age and to create to create the medusa again and to bring that
transition why is a world that we hunger for that transition to the bachic that transition
from the masculine to the feminine turn me into a woman what does that mean what does it mean when
