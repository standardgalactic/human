that of the sunet tiros the hetaira well hetaira they used to translate as
mistress hetaira is your mistress so it's using the same route to indicate the relationship is
that is one of lovers yeah and don't be surprised you saw hercules with his boy everywhere he's
leading around you saw jesus with his little boy and he's gotten the garden right you've seen this
with the little boys this just shouldn't shouldn't amaze you the thing that you haven't seen is the
women with the little boys right so we've got nothing to balance it we've got nothing to balance
hence the necessity of the transformation yeah this is gorgeous i love this stuff okay last i think
i have one more um well no not that one put up put up that one yep no that was it okay
so uh when we look at the big picture of the activation of the mystery
and we're looking at the actual practice of the mystery where we need to start forming a
vocabulary around it so that when somebody says abomination of desolation um that means something
right now do you sitting there abomination desolation doesn't mean anything that phrase doesn't
mean you can hear preachers throw that thing around none of them knows what it means none of them if
they knew it would make them even more faithful right but they follow the fairy tale they follow
the fairy tale so they can't grasp right it's the same thing that drove the classics department
the university of wisconsin to say the romans just wouldn't do such a thing i'm talking about drugs
the romans just wouldn't do such a thing right total how could you not of all the drugs that
we brought before us of all the drugs that you've seen now you know there's you could never make
that statement you know more than a classicist who is a professor that nine is just a professor
she was the head of my department she was the head of the department yes saint andrew's educated
yes and she didn't know she didn't know she had never seen you mean in all your time
in all your time of reading the iliad you never saw that they were using drugs did all did we
all miss the eunuch you know i was talking to the devil i was talking to the devil asking him
well you're not even gonna see the eunuch he says you didn't even see the eunuch
oh my god how do we miss these people how do we miss these things where's all this going
you don't know this world and people will sit up in front of you and will tell you
they will tell you this is how it is experts abomination of desolation abomination i defy you
to tell me what that is based upon what preachers priests and holy people say new testament scholars
they suck too yeah yeah what are these offerings what are these offerings what are these things that
are vomited forth these unclean things that she brings up in her cup from her poor naya from
her poor naya your history was built upon this right and daniel is a part of it through the
meads through the meads you cannot enter that kingdom without cutting off your own testicles
wow that's something okay okay a more circumspect now we've got to in the future from now on we're
going to start mounting our case because we've got the indictment is going to come down we know
that the transdimensional grand jury found that jesus's crimes are to be prosecuted so we're ready
to go we're ready to go they voted to prosecute so we have to be building a case now and in
order to do that we're going to have to take back these texts i gave you tonight as you're
sitting here and i respect your time all of you who are listening got tremendous respect
and i don't want to waste your time so i'm just going to say it like it is we need to kick down
the door of the temple and we need to take back these texts these are ours that one that i read
to you tonight that was buried that was buried by a religious sect in the 10th and 11th centuries
nine ninth and 10th and 11th centuries who buried this text they did not want you
understanding what was going on now maybe they did it from their own ignorance right and you
know you can't make a back translation without screwing things up right it just doesn't work
in effect they tried to do what the Babylonians did with the tower it tries to do it backwards
route it through Hebrew and it didn't work historically cronus saturn says no no don't
work don't work that way we're bound to time we're bound to time and before java was this mystery
now stop i just said the mystery produced everything do you remember in the garden
do you remember what we do we have our eyes opened and we end up stripped naked
welcome to the right and he'll say
