I let that liquor drown my days Now I'm taking my last ride
I paid the highest price you can pay And I'm on my way to Potter's Field
Potter's Grave is where I'll be To rest until the end of time
For all eternity
Welcome back to the Lady Babylon. This is Satanic Initiation and you guys are in for it tonight.
We've got to know the fresh text, something that you're not going to get out there anywhere else.
Something that you're not going to run into, but it's full of cult.
Tonight's text is crammed with cult, looking right into the eyes, those burning eyes of cult.
We're going to love this, and we have a little clip that was put together to celebrate your audience interaction.
I like this format. I like that we're able to converse like this, and it's important to me to keep it up.
I want you to enjoy tonight and welcome to Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation.
Let's start off right away with the few minutes that we've got together.
I just want to ramp up this little video that's coming up.
I want you to take a look at this. We look for meaning in the world.
And so we look through your interaction to see the meaning and to construct the message.
Here's a bit that has been brought to you by Chewie. Chewie, thank you very much. Hit it.
I bet that Mike stinks. What are we smelling? He has lost about the pharmacological knowledge.
I'd like some good plant drugs. It is like we are in a cosmic matrix womb.
Vatican reptile time travelers. Naked dinner? He's coming back with a sword and a golden bra.
Talk about roleplaying. You circumcised Jesus? Wait, the boy was the one that Jesus was pondering?
You think Jesus' lips were still purple when he was on the cross? I'm sure she'd love to know that.
That's right, God, you devilishly holy. She was way more than Barbie could ever be.
She always clothed in the sun. Sadder is below the bright moon tonight.
If you ever have to go to jail, you can stick your suboxons up there and have money too.
