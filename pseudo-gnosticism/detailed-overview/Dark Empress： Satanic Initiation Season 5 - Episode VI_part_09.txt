And what does it do? What does it do? It makes things living and it makes things dead. The power that we're talking about.
Insha'Allah. This power is the power to penetrate the cosmos. The power to create and destroy.
And it is in the hands of a woman. And that woman becomes a god. Fantastic. Are you there? The orgia. Do you see?
Do you see in these events, these orgies, these cults, these rituals? Do you see what happens? Do you see why Jehovah yesterday was yelling at us and saying,
Get my wife out of here. Get out of here. Yes, I'm Jehovah. I'm Jehovah. Get out of here. I hate women. I'm Jehovah.
Call me Yahweh. Don't say my name. Did you say my name? Did you say my name?
Yeah. Yeah. We were there with Him. What did He say? Dad? What's up, Dad? Tell me, Dad, what's your, what's your dictate?
Oh, son. I'm going to tell you, I just kicked out your mother. You know? And I want you to clean up the temple. Because I know what they're doing in the temple.
The women are telespherizing. And the men are getting telespherized. Wait, what? What, Daddy? What are the bad people doing in the temple of Jehovah?
In the temple of Jehovah. They are performing the rites. These disgusting, sex-addicted perverts with their drugs.
Yes. Do you see where the face of hatred comes from for the great Queen Aphrodite? Do you see why the Romans said, We are the sons and daughters of Venus, the morning star?
Do you see why Julius Caesar himself walked into the temple of Venus Genetrix and put there a portrait from a famous Greek artist of Medea?
Do you see why the people of Rome so loved the impress?
Yes. Yes. Because you can't have the two together. You cannot have Jehovah and Aphrodite. You cannot. You cannot. It's so deep that the very Sophia that you will base your scriptures on is an Aphrodisiac.
Did you say it? What? Yeah, it's a scheme of Aphrodisia. Oh, wow. Do you mean my sex organs are here for a reason? Do you think that there's some way that this whole universe could make sense like a song, like the song of a great singer pulled right from the event horizon of a black star?
Oh, God. This is Lady Babylon. Thank you for coming tonight. It is an honor and a privilege, and I appreciate your 40 minutes. Hail Satan.
To me on Sunday, Scola Breaker.
