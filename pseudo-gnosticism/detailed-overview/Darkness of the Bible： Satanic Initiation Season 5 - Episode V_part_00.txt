I let that liquor drown my days. Now I'm taking my last ride. I paid the highest price you can pay.
I'm on my way to Potter's Field. The Palmer's Grave is where I'll be to rest until the end of time for all eternity.
Thank you for your patience tonight. Welcome back to Lady Babylon Satanic Initiation. We have got for you a place that we're just going to go and have a good time then.
We're going to find this spot. We're going to mellow out. We're going to enter that antiquity and we're going to do that through this hypnotic song.
I love it. Tonight you're in for a real treat on Lady Babylon.
I'm not going to waste your time but I am going to announce that Gnostic Informant is downloading or uploading I should say.
Gnostic Informant is uploading his fantastic Medea that I have not yet seen. I've heard a clip and it sounds just gorgeous.
So thank you. Thank you Gnostic for that. Tonight I don't want to waste any of your time because we're already blasted off late here.
And I want to value what you have to give. And so tonight as we sit on that throne as we start going in to see what the real mystery is.
Because remember you perverts didn't just come here for fun. This is an investigation. We have to have some evidence and some facts that we're looking at.
And tonight we're going to invade that most intimate of spaces. We're going to enter into that sacred space of Aphrodite.
And as usual Chewie has put together a mesmerizing video to plant within you the correct images now that you are seated on the throne.
Now that you are seated on the throne. Chewie hit it.
