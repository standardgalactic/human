Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burnin'
Do my veins, and the indos crazy and the scots
Then what's to bash out the brain?
Oh that English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you gotcha sellin' and you gotcha
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome back to Lady Babylon Wednesday Night Bible Study
It's so nice to have you here tonight
We'll be taking a tour to the end of March
Yes, we only fulfilled half of our obligation
Half of our obligation, I'm so excited
We only fulfilled half of it by seeing them die
Right, we're there with the soldiers and everything
It's a son of God
We've only fulfilled half
Tonight we go to the second half of our commission here
And we investigate the kid that was, I'm sorry I almost said naked
But he's just a kid
The kid that was sitting next to dead Jesus
When Mary Magdalene and Salome showed up
Tonight we're gonna summon Celsus
And that's the touch point
That's gonna give us what we really need to blow up
Again, welcome back
Tonight I want to begin with some subliminal messaging
And a little bit of bringing the future and the past altogether in the present
Gonna throw some images at you
And I want us to be critical again as investigators
As those who appeal to reason, right
People have been telling me, sources, fantastic
We love it, this is ours
This is the museum that belongs to us
I'm gonna put you in the mood tonight and set you on your way
Chewie hit it
This fight has come to us
And you know what I say, bring it on
No homos will ever be allowed on this church
As long as I'm the pastor here
To let you know that verse one is the truth
The whole truth and nothing but the truth
So help you God when you understand faith
The devil's hoping you don't know who you are
In a few years they'll die out
Do you know why they can't reproduce?
Cancer, cancer, cancer
All the pain is gone
We've prepared, birds prepare, eagles don't prepare
We've said, hookah, hookah, hookah, hookah
Jesus would say to our politicians today
Who are telling us what light bulbs we can and can't use
But they won't say don't murder your children
Someone who is so deeply into paganism is to do this
It was restricted from the privileges and rights
Of citizenship within the nation
Because they had defiled the image of God
This is how you breathe in hell, it was like
Those quotes were by Celsus
And where we've gone tonight
You know, we usually get in the ship
And we go and we resurrect this dead
And we talk to the dead
Tonight what we're going to do is drag back with us
Everything
We are going now to the present
In the second century
Anno Domini
Also known as the year of our Lord
Yes, yes, we're going back
We're going back
Some of them like to call him Yahweh
Right?
