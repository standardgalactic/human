What are they doing in their meetings?
To get some sort of power
From pronouncing the names of demons
What? They're in meetings
Pronouncing the names of demons
Okay, people back me up, right?
We're all going in to this crime scene
Back me up, here we are
Okay, what are they doing?
They're using the names for the demons
Or saying certain incantations
Hmm, epodes
Epodes, oh, I love it
I love it, now I know where I am
Where's the table with the drink?
Is it a drink or something?
I don't care, where are you...
You can put it anywhere you want
Just let's get in
Let's get on board
Let's get this throne set up
Yeah, this is gorgeous
The Christians claim to get some sort of power
Yeah, they're always incorporating
In these incantations, these epodes
Remember, epodes are the songs
That are used in conjunction with the drugs
That you and I are seeing in the things
Like the Mithras Liturgy
Fantastic!
Do you have them, Christians?
Do you have them?
Here we go
They even use the name Jesus
And a short story about him in the formula
It's no different than the Mithraic Liturgy, right?
It's the same thing, you can see them all
Look, I brought you back to an early Christian orgy
Congratulations!
It's somebody, somebody
And all I had to do was just ask this dead person
Just ask this dead person
This is like, none of this
Nobody can say, Poo Poo!
Neniskos is a dirty old man, Poo Poo!
Right, you can't do that
Because I'm just talking celsus
That's all I'm doing
Jesus himself was thought to work wonders
By the use of magic and incantations
And interestingly enough, notice that the two are separate
And right away, you and I, children of the modern era
We don't know why those should be separate
We don't know what the difference between magic and incantations is
We don't know if this is part of healing religion
We don't know what this is, we don't know where the drugs are
We don't know what the visions are, we know they're having visions
Profits, they're producing profits
Oh my goodness
I'm going to give you one more
Only because I know you love it
You guys have a sick fascination
A sick fascination
It's like getting down to that original peel
You ever pick it, pick it somebody else's scabs?
Yeah
You don't necessarily have to
You get down to that lower level
It's that fresh, invigorated flesh
It's got that blood of death
That's what we call it, we don't call it the mixture of life
We call it that which brings death
