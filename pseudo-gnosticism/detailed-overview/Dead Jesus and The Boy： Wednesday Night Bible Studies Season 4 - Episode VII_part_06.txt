No, it just stops
He's sitting on the right hand of
Somebody or something
Or some corpse
Sitting on the right hand of it
Which is the cult mystery position
Love it, love it
What's this kid doing there?
Let's see what happens, let's see what happens
What does he say? He's sitting on the right hand
Oh, he's wearing a stolled nail kit
He's wearing the white robes of an initiate
Do you love that?
Can you smell the drugs that are in the air already?
If you don't, it's too late and you're about to go nuts
I'm not kidding, I'm not kidding
Have you ever been to one of these cemetery rituals?
Here we go, yeah
And he says to them, yeah
Don't, the kid speaks up
He says, don't be afraid
Don't be amazed
Because they're shocked
Why are they shocked?
They're walking to a tomb
There's a kid sitting there
It might be in too loud
He says, shut up, old man
You're being loud
But is there, what's the kid doing?
I'm sorry, I get so excited
When these kids get involved with Jesus
Can we see that kid with Jesus again?
Look at Jesus' face here, people
Come on, look at him
That's a man who knows
He's about to get scandalized
You know what I mean?
That's a man who knows
He's been touching like he shouldn't
Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ
Yeah, yeah
Both of those are titles
Thank you very much
Okay, and he says to them, don't be afraid
He says, you're looking for Jesus
The Nazarene
Yeah, what is he doing?
The one that was crucified
That's what he says
Look, this is the one
You know, the one that was crucified
Well, he opened his eyes
He what?
Yeah
He opened his eyes
And then the Greek says
And everybody translates that
Do we have that one?
Everybody translates this
As that one
Yeah, there we go
Everybody translates this
I just want you to see
It's a demonstrative adverb
Look at the top
Demonstrative adverb of hode
Hode is just such a one
Right, so it's the demonstrative adverb form of that
So in this way, or thus, you know
Thusly, look at number two
Of a state or condition, as it is
