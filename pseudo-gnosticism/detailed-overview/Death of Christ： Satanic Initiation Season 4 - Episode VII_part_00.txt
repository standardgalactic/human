Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burnin'
Do my veins, Indian goes crazy and the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you gotcha sellin' and you gotcha
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Drankin' whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation.
We're almost done here with the season, isn't that amazing?
Thanks for sticking around for so long.
I appreciate your time and I respect it.
So I'd like to get right to things tonight with a couple of comments.
Just to get some feedback here, can you flash those up there Chewie?
Actually, you know what? Let me just tell you what we're going to do in general tonight.
We're sorry, I didn't mean to jump right on like that.
You can't do that to people, right?
Okay, this is what we're going to do.
We're going to get in that time ship and we're going to go back right to the moment to the crucifixion.
I mean, we're going to be time stoppers.
We're going to stop it right at that moment so that you can see the expression on his face.
So that you can see him 100%.
I want you close enough to smell him so that you can tell me, as investigators, you can tell me, I think this is what's going on.
Tonight we've got a mystery.
Yeah, we're detectives tonight, people.
And tonight we're going to find out what happened.
Who killed Jesus tonight on Lady Babylon?
And let's go forward.
