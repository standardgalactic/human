The muse is a divinity that inspires poets.
She's the voice of inspiration.
In antiquity, she was worshipped.
Does the muse have a name?
There are several of them, yeah.
What are they?
Cleo is the muse of history.
So, as I was a graduate student, I considered myself her student.
Medea is a Roman muse.
She was the first, and I consider myself a student of her poetry.
How do they affect what you say and what you do?
The muses use poetry to inspire.
So, as a teacher, I consider it my duty and obligation to serve that process of inspiration, poetic inspiration.
Do you hear the muse from time to time?
Not audibly.
I read poetry, so I hear her speak through the poems.
And do you hear either of your muses in your mind from time to time?
I don't hear anything in my mind that I don't read from a text as an academic.
No, I don't hear any voices in my head.
How is it that the muse guides you from day to day?
Well, the muse is of the purpose of the muse, was to reveal beauty.
And so the servant of the muse is bound to perpetuate that teaching.
Any of your bound?
Yes.
To that?
I would say so, yes.
So you're bound to the muses then, right?
