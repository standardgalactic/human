Sailing into the 17th century
We're going to make our first stop here
Jump out, roll out, right
Of the time machine
Here we go, we're talking about plays
And we're talking about very well educated gent
With access to classical knowledge
And he is going to tell us through his sources
About Cersei
And if I'm good enough as a classical philologist
I can show you where his sources are
That's what's cool about it
So anyway, here we go
I just want to read to you this translation
Right, old Spanish, I don't do it
It just doesn't, not my thing
And I wouldn't ever pretend for it to be
Okay, but look at these
This is a 19th century translation
When people still value color on
Okay, he's still here, right
The professor friend of mine is going to give me a hard time
Okay, he says, conquering adverse fate
You have come bearing these divine flowers with thee
This is Odysseus coming
And this is Cersei and Odysseus interacting
Right, and Odysseus has shown up with a plant
That's been given to him by Iris, a plant
Okay, and he says bearing these divine flowers with thee
Which are beautyous antidotes
Which are godscent exorcisms
Against deadly poisoned drafts
Against magical bewitchments
Right, so for the hardcore pharmacologist
Or a tox person, right
Yeah, I don't go into the witchery
I'm sorry, you're going to have to
Because there's an entire language to describe
These different states
Yeah, and the use of these drugs
These compounds, yes
In order to create a communion
Okay, blast that off there, let's go back
Good, next, let's go next to the
Boom, here's another one
This is what Iris says
See this floral branch I bear
Jimmed with buds that Flora tended
To be the antidote against Cersei's poisoned secrets
Nice, nice
Nice, who is this Cersei?
In order to bring her up we're going to have to go get Alice
From Alice in Wonderland, this is the Oxford
Greek lexicon, middle of the 19th century
Knowing many drugs or charms, great
Who does that? Look at the first word
We've got there in Greek, Ietroy
Those are doctors, Ietroy
And you see the reference is the Iliad, 16
So at least by Homer's time
Right, we have this concept
This is an old, old concept
Who else is this way? Kierke
She is one of these
Knowing drugs or charms
What is a charm?
A charm, biochemist friend of mine
Is something that you put inside of your body
That causes you to enter a state
Yeah, okay
Beginning of the psychedelic renaissance
Here we go
Let's bring that back up, that definition please
Thank you, Julie
Who else do we call this?
Polypharmacos, many drugs
Pion, pion, right?
Pion, who is pion?
Who is pion?
Yeah, just come back to me
Pion is the therapeutic manifestation
Yeah, the great archer
Who by his poison
Brought to you by the serpents
He brings both death and life
Yeah, people always learn about that
When I was in graduate school
Why is it, why is it?
It's a healing cult
But he's the God of death, right?
Right, it's because you have to keep your hand
On that rope
And that rope is the pharmacologist
And that rope is the pharmacology
