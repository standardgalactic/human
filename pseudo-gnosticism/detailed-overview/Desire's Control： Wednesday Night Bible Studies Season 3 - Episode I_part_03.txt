Okay
Look at these cultures
And look what they're doing
Look what they're using
Alright, Calderon is using specific sources
Bring up the next, please
Notice that he describes Cersei
As Nigromante in Cantadora in Ergumana
Now, excuse me if I mispronounced that
But I'm showing you the words
Original that he's using for necromancer
A singer or enchanter
Right, and one who is controlled by daimonace
He just stole a Greek word
He just stole it
I saw that dirty Calderon
I saw him
He just dove back there into the pool of antiquity
And he swam and he pulled up a word out of it
And he gave it to his people
I thought that's a person worth honoring right there
I admire that
Okay, next
I think we've got one more Calderon
Here, we're describing Cersei, right?
We're describing Cersei
And she says, that great star whose undiminished power
And beauty let along captive day, untired, delighted
Was my splinter crown, fire
Nice
All of these children, Cersei and Medea
That we talk about
They are the granddaughters of the sun
Yes, the granddaughters of the sun
Within our cult
Of sun, moon, and stars
So when I talk about darkening the sun
Right, when I talk about the power of the moon
These are the things
This geometry is coming from antiquity
And this Spaniard is swimming
He's swimming in it
Love it
And what does he say?
Being of Medea's kindred
I with her, a child was reared in Thessaly
As a sister
She was reared with her in Thessaly as a sister
And why is this important?
We bring up Thessaly
Hold on to the rope
That's in the cave, guys
Hold on to the rope
It's the drugs
Drug origins, Thessaly is known
For having the most bountiful supply
Of extremely toxic drugs
It's where all the witches come from
Right, why?
Because it's where they get their things
It's where they get their craft
As soon as your market goes to Rome
You get all this stuff in Rome
You got witches in Rome
You got witches in Rome picking up dead bodies
Not picking them up, but from the pile
Where they put them after the circus
Taking their organs and harvesting
Why? For the sake of chemistry
Dote and antidote
We have sources that say
The beginning of medicine
The very beginning of medicine
Is not...
Hippocrates, right?
What's going on a thousand years before Hippocrates?
Dote and antidote
Experimentation with toxins
These are cultures that have way more knowledge
Way more knowledge about human physiology
Than you understand
Or that we've been led to believe
Yeah, they're actually engineering people
With polypharmaceutical compounds
Fantastic, okay
So polypharmacy is one of the things
That we want to talk about
You can talk about treating illness
Or condition by means of a drug
And you can add many drugs to it
And have polypharmacy
Have a multi-pronged level
Of fighting, of medicine
There's another layer
