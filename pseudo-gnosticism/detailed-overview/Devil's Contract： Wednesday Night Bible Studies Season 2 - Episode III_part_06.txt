Maybe that's why Jehovah kicked out his wife.
It could be cause trouble.
Just put the pieces together.
You know what I mean?
Just show it.
You know, it's not your honor.
This is not like, you know, like, you don't have to be smart to see that Jesus is a perv
and a garden that I know I'm telling them.
I'm telling them.
Let's keep going with the text.
This is intense.
I love this.
Thank you.
I hope you're all being spanked into conformity in that chat.
Yes.
Chat away.
Chat away.
Next great test.
Oh, back to the baptism into death.
I forgot, guys.
Look, look, look.
Why is he doing this?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just as the Christos was raised, eknecron from that place where all the shades are from the

Wonderful.
There is your mark of Cain.
Yeah.
This is fantastic.
I love this.

We're with Jesus.
Go to the next one, please.
Fantastic.
Then Jesus was compelled.
He was led.
In that first line, that on eknecron is from onago.
And you have onago.
Chewie, bring up onago.
Yeah.
Look at this, people.
Look at this.
If you can see it real close, real close here.
Yeah.
To lead up from a lower place, right?
As opposed to catago.
Catago is to push down upon.

Do I smell resurrection?
Look at number four.
Bringing up, especially from the dead.
Ha, a spouse into the light.
It's the transition.

Those of us who bought what the civil said about analog, we're able to follow.
Those of you who don't have ears to hear blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Let's go back to the, back to the Greek.
