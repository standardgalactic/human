Let's hurry up because the devil's supposed to show up, right?
We're performing magic.
Aren't we signing?
Don't we have signatures here?
I have so many signatures to collect tonight.
Yes.
So he's there for 40 days and 40 nights.
And the one who's, who's doing the trial comes and he says to him, if you are, you know,
here it is, you know, we're at Monty Python's bridge, right?
If you are the son of God, it's time to prove it.
This is formulaic.
This is formulaic.
It's no different than what you're going to see with Heracles.
Get your Victoria's secret.
Get your Victoria's secret on.
Heracles needs to stand up.
Are you the son of God?
Let's see what happens.
If you're all son of God, what?
Speak.
You want the magic?
Here it comes.
Speak.
So that these rocks become bread.
The trans, take it down.
The transmutation, the realigning, the binding.
That brings matter transfer is based in frame in mind.
Wow.
That, that's straight up Pythagorean crazy talk.
Right?
Totally.
Okay.
Anyway, back to our text.
And then give me the next one.
And then the devil took a hold of him, grabbed him by the collar and sent him to the, to
the holy city and put him on the spire and put him on the top, put him in the wings.
This is what it says.
Depending on the construction, be a different part of the building.
Anyway, put him up there.
Transport.
Look what he did.
Transport.
Yeah.
Transport.
Cross time and space.
That's gorgeous.
Love it.
And anyway, he said to him, if you're the son of God, here's number two.
That was strike one.
If you're the son of God, by the way, for those of you who realize that we're just reading
the Bible right now, you'll realize that Satan is indeed in control.
Isn't it nice?
Jesus gets yanked around question and yanked around.
Is he worthy of the throne?
Is he a son of God?
This is what happens when you mingle with the daughters of men.
Yes.
It's gorgeous.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Go ahead.
Son of God, throw yourself down.
Now, and then the devil goes on the quote and he's just using a quote that he would
be familiar with because if you are the son of God, then this will happen.
You won't be able to kill yourself.
You won't give it a shot.
Yeah.
And Jesus backs again.
He doesn't take it.
Strike two.
Right?
Do you see the magic?
Yeah.
Follow the follow the line through the cave.
And then the devil took him to a high mountain and he showed to him.
What did he show to him?
It's on the next one.
No.
Next one.
That's yep.
We're good.
Look online.
