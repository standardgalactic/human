Number three.
What did he show him?
He showed him toss Basileas.
And if you have noticed in Greek, Basilea can be a kingdom.
But it's the same word for queen.
It's funny.
Yes.
We don't say kingdom in antiquity.
We don't say kingdom.
We say kingdom.
Now, please, I just want.
I want to send a message.
Cross time and space into the mind.
Into the mind of Mary Beard.
I want her to be wherever she is.
Just maybe she's sleeping.
Probably sleeping right now.
I want her to wake up.
I want you to wake up, Mary.
And I want you to have been here with us.
And I want you to have seen that the very power in antiquity has a female root that women were not staying indoors.
It's called a kingdom.
Not a kingdom for a reason.
Logically, because we have queens.
Oh, well, that explains all the ancient queens.
Yeah.
So much for the staying indoors.
We can't tolerate garbage here in this temple.
We can't.
Yeah.
I would like to give you a little video.
And then I'm just going to finish up.
And I just want you to see this little video.
Because it highlights the magic and analog for you.
For those of you with ears to hear.
You will take that then.
And you will be able to form the pact.
And to sit on the throne.
Yeah, to bear the mark.
Video.
Long before goodbyes are said.
Long before goodbyes are said.
And I can see the end from here.
I can see the end from here.
And it's coming this way past.
It won't be long until tomorrow is in the past.
That's what you need.
I'm going to start a Saturday.
Class.
On necromancy.
It will be half.
Half an hour.
Of.
Hardcore intensive Greek.
And half an hour.
Of Greek necromancy texts.
Yeah, and if anybody is interested.
They're welcome to come.
They're welcome to come.
And I want you people who have already expressed interest in coming.
And I know those of you who will be coming.
I want you to bring your book along with you.
If you don't have it this week, you can have it next.
But this is the second edition of the Hanson and Quinn.
Intensive Greek that they taught us at Berkeley.
When I did the intensive Greek session there.
Half of our class will be working out.
The other half will be.
Shooting the vapor is necromancy.
And I want to put a warning on the class that will be on discord.
And I want to put a warning.
That.
I'm going to require that you have a strong stomach.
That this will all be unfiltered.
And that we will, I will take you some places that.
Yeah, that will give you a.
Give you the images that you need.
By the way, Jesus is a necromancer.
Did I forget to put that detail on there?
Yeah, he's a necromancer.
And if you line up the language, the Greek side by side with the text, he's a.
He's one of them.
