then you should keep up the direction you're going.
But if you want to be purifying citizens,
to be better citizens, to be less violent,
to be more unified, these are the kind of rights
that you have that spring up.
Mystery rights.
Mystery rights are unifying.
Unifying.
Fantastic.
Let's go to the next source.
This is, I love this.
This is just Paul.
I just wanted you to see where he said,
oh, his big glory thing was in Christ.
Right?
Good.
Keep it next.
Good.
Thank you, Paul.
Have a seat.
No, that's all.
That's all I needed.
Here's a great, big, long text.
I'm going to translate this to you really fast.
It's going to be really dirty.
And you took sons and daughters
who you gave birth to
and you sacrificed them to the gods
for the sake of analysis.
Bring up the next.
Analysis.
What is analysis?
Look at the definition number two.
Definition number two.
Consumption.
Consumption.
What is being consumed in the sacrifices of the children?
Their mortality is being consumed.
And every once in a while, it kills them.
Oh, let's see what they're doing with these fumigations.
Let's see what they're doing to the babies.
Right?
They're doing this to the babies to burn off the mortality.
This is gorgeous.
Let's keep going with that same giant text up there.
That was disturbing.
Fantastic.
Yes.
And what else are they doing?
Caesphaxa.
Statechna.
Su.
Caedocas alta.
Yeah.
So you're sacrificing these children
and you're giving them for the sake of this apotropa...
Apotropaic exercise.
This is literally in the Greek where it is.
It's apotropais this thigh.
What is that for?
What is that for?
You are averting evil.
What do you do when Lady Justice...
What do you do?
Bring up some images.
What do you do when Lady Justice needs support?
You give her that support.
If you do not, you have a society that is no longer clean.
They have become tainted.
A lie is not necessarily a lie.
Did God say, remember who is the first biblical liar?
It's not the devil.
The devil is the first one to point out the biblical liar extraordinaire.
And that's God.
God, Jehovah, the guy who's screaming in his wife now
for what I'm about to show you.
She did behind his back.
He's screaming.
A lie.
If you lose justice, you've got nothing between what is false and what is true.
That's not natural.
Justice is what you should naturally possess by following reason.
Fantastic.
That's the pagan way, right?
I don't mean to lecture.
Let's get back to the text because you're not here to hear my thoughts.
You're here to see what the texts are saying.
And so there's an even greater bad thing that you did.
You can't imagine.
You can't remember when you were an infant.
Whoops, now I can't see the text.
Are we okay?
Okay.
Good.
Sorry.
I think we hit an asteroid.
We hit an asteroid.
We're back up, Chewie.
Fantastic.
Thank you for taking care of that.
You don't remember when you were an infant, do you?
And what happened to you?
You were Goomne.
He's talking to a woman now.
You were Goomne.
You were naked.
And you were in a place of exposure.
And you were baptized or dipped or died in the blood.
And you lived.
Pull it back right away.
What you just had described to you from the Bible is the right of the child sacrifice.
And when I say sacrifice, I say the burning of the incense.
That is the Greek sacrifice.
Are they killing their children?
Are they killing their children?
Do you really think?
Do you really think?
They take all of these new mothers and they're just going to step forward and follow the
fairy tale that Christianity has taught you that there's this great statue of Molek.
And we take our children.
It burns.
Man, the mother comes in.
They sacrifice to their gods.
No, that's a fairy tale.
People, he just described to you what the ritual is.
They are burning off the mortality of a child by subjecting it to this process of fumigation.
Do some of the children die in the process?
Yes.
It's sad to report that some of them do.
Okay.
This is not what you've been told.
Check the text out itself.
See what it says.
Let's go back to it.
Let's keep reading.
Keep reading.
This is fantastic.
