I never meant anything I said, just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin' to keep it from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant, I never said the letters that I should've said
And so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows
When I say, never was the cause for the long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
This is our 30-minute Thursday night Bible study
And tonight I'm gonna take you somewhere that you haven't yet been
This is gonna be fun
We'll also have a couple of clips of Derek Lambert from MythVision
And I wanna look at a couple of things that he said in a recent video
Just emphasize those great points that he's making
After that we'll talk about Pliny
Bring him back from the dead
We'll look into some of the deepest, darkest, confusing bits of gospel that you'll ever see
On Lady Babylon tonight
So I'll also have a little appearance tomorrow night
On Gnostic Informant we'll be talking about drugs
Talking about the drugs of antiquity
A topic that nobody ever, ever wants to talk about
Classicists included
Classicists included
It's getting a little bit better
A professor from Brown told me it'll take people 10 years to catch up
And then once they do it'll take off
Well, it's been about 12 years now
So we ought to be making some progress in the field of ancient drugs
Try going for fun
Try going to your preacher, pastor, minister, priest
Try going to one of those people and asking them
What do you know about drugs?
When they tell you they don't know anything, if they're honest
You can just say a book of thanks for being honest
But when they try to bring up the topic of a goat
Ignore them, run, run, you're in the wrong place
That's the only back alley they can find to catch you
And is that goat, that goat a sacrifice?
It has nothing to do with anything, anything
Especially not the language
They love to dance around those silly poles all the time
It's hilarious
Let's get on with a couple of clips tonight
Of myth vision
Derek has hit a couple of points this week
That I was just like, hey, kudos to this man
Kudos to him and what he is doing
There's an honor, a real honor in this
He has really captured the Satanic spirit
Yeah, he's on fire with it
Chewie hit us
He's just saying we're at a battle here in terms of ideologies
Which affect all sorts of other things
From politics, ethics, you name it
Do you want to see the world become a better place?
I do
And I am in no way saying we need to shut down all religion
Or people should not be allowed to practice them
