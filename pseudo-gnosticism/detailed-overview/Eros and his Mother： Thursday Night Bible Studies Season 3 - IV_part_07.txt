Because they couldn't
Find any falsehood
In the story, they didn't reveal anything
Right? And so the priest says
You know, since we can't
Bring out any
Fault, then I'm not going to
I'm not gonna contradict here
What's going on?
Yes, yes, yes, let's go to the next
Text
I just wanted you to see Kledos here
Kledos here, ah
Yes, necromanic ties
For those of you who want to pause that
And take a look at it, let's go to the next test though
I want to go back really quick
To Pliny, and I want to read this to you
The Mithridatic antidote is composed of
Four and fifty ingredients
None of what you're using exactly
The same proportion and the quantity
Prescribed is in some cases
So small as the sixtieth part
Of one denarius, that's not very much
Which of the gods pray
Can have an instructed man
And such trickery as this
A height to which the mere subtlety
Of human invention could surely never have reached
Come on, calm down, Pliny
This clearly must emanate
From a vain ostentation
Of scientific skill
And must be
Set down as a monstrous system
Yes, puffling off
The medical art
You see that, they're so
Specific with their measurements
For all of these ingredients
Right, they're just
Showing off their scientific skill
That's all they're doing
So when the priest pulls out
Water of
God's judgment
And is able to administer it
Don't let it be surprised
This knowledge is there
This knowledge is there, fantastic
I want to take you really quick
Why did we go to the Mithridatic
I want you to consider the treacle well
For everybody who's in satanic initiation
I want you to consider the treacle well
And consider it
That Lewis Carroll
Took Alice
