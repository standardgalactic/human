There with her sisters in a boat
He didn't take her to the well
But he
Talked about the well
In Oxford, and he said
There are three girls that live at the bottom
Of this well, right
That treacle, that word treacle
Is based off the Greek theriac
And for those of you
Who have been paying attention
This
Explosion of knowledge
Comes partially because of what
This Carroll's advisor is doing
In classics
So if you really want to understand
Alice in Wonderland
And the use of the treacle well
You want
You want to dip
Into antiquity
Yes, and then all of a sudden
The symbols are there
And instead of saying like that
Terrible English translation
They send them off into the woods
And they came back and it makes no sense
Where's the drug involved
By the way, it says after that
He untied their hands
He released their bonds and let them go
Right, so this is exactly
It matches Pliny's
Almost
Contemporary description
Pliny's first century
This gospel is really second century
It's like 150 somewhere
Around there
So yeah
It's okay, you're within
80 years
Of each other
That's not much
So it's good
Contemporary evidence, Pliny
And the gospel is using the same
Language to illustrate
The same type of event
Yeah, it's wonderful
And what I'll do is I'll continue
With this through
Neil tomorrow
Anastic Informant tomorrow
And we'll talk about some of the hardcore
Drug texts
And what they're doing
What doctors are doing in antiquity
