You asked for it.
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave on the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a star coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed all the way
Why did you ever change your name all the way?
Why did you ever change your name?
Welcome back to the final season of Lady Babylon's Satanic initiation.
It's nice to have you back.
I've been talking to so many of you lately
And I just can't tell you how much I appreciate.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I appreciate all the time that we've spent together.
Every moment I can feel you.
And I get some of those emails and I think,
My goodness, how fortunate I am.
How fortunate I am to be in your company.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Today, I'm going to take you right into Epsilon.
We saw Alpha in our last series of seven.
We will progress through right through those spheres.
Those harmonic spheres will progress right through them.
We went through Alpha.
We saw the burial.
We come to Epsilon.
We take ourselves into the wilderness.
Today on Lady Babylon's Satanic initiation,
I want to invite you.
I want to invite you to Jesus.
I want you to see him and I want you to see all the drugs that are involved.
Today, I want you to have that antiquity.
It is what we inherited.
It is ours.
Welcome to Lady Babylon.
Before we begin, I want to tell you that tomorrow I will be on forbidden knowledge news.
And it's an interview that I'm very much looking forward to.
I appreciate the chance to be able to do that.
Tonight, I'm going to be prepping and I'm not going to have time for discord.
I apologize, but I'm not going to shift some of my work that I've got for tomorrow to this evening.
Thank you.
Thank you for coming.
I don't want to waste your time.
I want to go right into it and you know what we have to do.
You know what we have to do.
Are you in that throne?
Oh, I can feel it.
I can feel it.
Good.
We have to start with a cleansing.
This is all purgation.
Welcome to the apocalypse.
It's all purgation.
Let's get on it before we come to those texts and remember people.
Keep this scientific.
We don't care about ideas.
We don't care about values.
We don't care about morals.
We care about evidence.
That's it.
We are scientists of the purest strain.
I will wash that dark blood right out of you.
I'll bring it right out of you.
It's a purgation.
Tonight, in order to achieve this, do you smell sulfur?
I smell sulfur.
In order to achieve this, we're going to bring Eros.
Yeah.
Tonight, it's Eros.
Tonight, it's Eros.

You thought for a minute it was the baby, didn't you?
He thought it was.
I want you to see Eros as sons of Venus, daughters of Aphrodite.
I want you to see Eros through that lens from antiquity.
That is what we're bringing tonight.
That is that Epsilon.
That is that Epsilon.
Let's go to our first passage.
Bring it up.
This is going to be a little controversial.
I'm going to start off with the hot stuff.
Are you guys ready?
I watched somebody sent me a video this week and said,
hey, look at this guy talking about porneia.
And he was, you know, could I smell it?
I watched it and I smelled.
I was like, what's this guy all about?
And he was a seminarian.
I could smell it.
They got that.
He got that seminarian smell to him.
You know what I mean?
