People can tell that.
The seminarians are going to lead you down a path, porneia.
He's going to define the porneia.
The only thing I want to say is you come out
through going down a rabbit hole and coming up
through the other side of the globe.
You're in a different dimension of morality.
What is porneia?
Fornication.
Fornication.
Oh, and it's idolatry.
Yes, it's idolatry.
And this was the debate back and forth.
The only thing I'm telling you is,
while our ship is getting primed here to get us back
to our destination, you've got to know the world sees
this material through a corrupted lens.
It sees it through a bent lens.
We have to go back to that original to find it.
And how is it so bent?
How is it so bent?
It is bent through eros.
Yeah.
When you try to change nature, you end up bending things.
Fantastic.
Let me show you exactly what I mean.
Bring up the, you want to see what porne is.
Porne, right?
When I say porne, I'm talking about a Greek root.
Get your dirty, don't be dirty.
Everybody here, come on, man.
This is civilized, right?
Porne is a Greek root, right?
Porne is a Greek root.
And we know, they'll say, what is porne?
And they'll say, oh, prostitute, prostitute, right?
Can I tell you how many words there are for prostitutes
and how many shades there are?
Look at Hesechius that we've got here on the left people.
I'm not going to give you any of my ideas.
I'm going to give you Hesechius, right?
Pornamen.
Look at that first one.
He puts polaine underneath it.
That's to sell, to enter into merchandising.
Polaine.
You got merch?
You know what you say?
You know what an ancient Greek who invents democracy hears?
When you say merch, he hears you are selling your orifices.
Love that.
How about this one?
How about this for good old fashioned morality?
You see what happens when the Christians
denied the gods, those atheist Christians.
When they denied the gods, they took all of this with them.
It's terrible.
Look what we've got here.
Pornamenai.
Uh-oh.
Kentuminai, those are the people who have been stung.
What is a porne?
Somebody who's been stung and who is entering into the commerce.
Wait, you have to be stung?
Yeah, if you don't know what I'm talking about,
you haven't been there.
You haven't been there at the pocket.
You're going to love it.
Are you ready?
Look at the next one underneath that.
Porniocopos.
What is that?
It's a hetira trough that he tells you underneath.
It's somebody who supports a hetira.
What is that hetira?
That's the person that you support who supports you
with the arts of Aphrodite.
Does that make sense?
Yes, you support them back.
You give them support, right?
So that's what you're engaging in there.
That's what you're engaging in.
Give us one more time.
Give us that.
Oh, look at the bottom one.
And by the way, it says pornos for that last one.
Now look at the bottom one, pornoi.
What is that?
It's paidi oraioi.
Show them the next one just to blow it up,
just so you guys can see this.
And I hope that the evangelicals out there
who are talking about this on YouTube, I hope, I hope,
please tell me they will come and see this.
Look, pornoi.
These are paidi oraioi.
What does it take it down?
What is a pornos?
It is a child who is at the bloom at the perfect ripeness.
And you say, oh, cleanse my ears.
Cleanse my ears.
Do you feel, do you feel a little bit of taste
in the back of your mouth, right?
Because that's gross.
I mean, it's just, it's creepy gross, right?
Hang on before you jump off the ship.
You're sailing on the SS Virgin Mary.
Yeah, this is who we're talking about.
The SS Virgin Mary is a ship full of a tiraioi.
Did you wonder why they auctioned her off?
Did they wonder why they auctioned
the Blessed Mother of Christ?
Did you wonder why they auctioned her off?
Oh, it was whoever got luckiest.
Yeah, casting her light.
The guys went running down.
Thank you to the cops for bringing us this.
The guys went running down.
Did you hear?
They're giving away the Virgin.
She's the one who's been in the temple.
This is Jewish practice.
If you're not up with this, you know, sorry.
But it's Jewish practice.
And Mary's out there.
They got her.
She's 12 years old.
And you know why she looks the way she does?
