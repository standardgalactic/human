And Adonis is now entering the underworld.
And when he enters, we celebrate a marriage.
We celebrate a marriage.
Do you think Eros has power only over the air?
Now, he has power over that dark matter that
makes up the under, that makes up that void.
He has power there.
Isn't that amazing?
You know, the only thing that can never be conquered
in the mind of an orific, the power of Eros, unconquerable.
Oh, God, you got to love it.
OK, let's go back.
Let's go back.
You thought Jesus was going into a wilderness.
I think that's hilarious.
OK, watch what happens here.
Who are these people?
Look at the second line.
They're murderers.
They're murderers.
And what else are they?
They're what?
They're pornois.
Anybody got a kid in the bloom of his youth around here?
I know one guy that did.
I know one guy that had a naked kid with him in a public park
when he was arrested.
Do you know who was arrested, children, in a public park
with a naked boy?
I'll tell you who was arrested in a public park
with a naked boy.
Jesus Christ, child of the Virgin,
he was arrested in a public park with a naked boy.
Could he have been a member?
Could he have been involved?
Did he ever say anything about your honor?
Overruled.
Did he ever say anything about resurrection?
Do you remember it?
Anyone want to step forward?
Because that's what all this second death cult does.
Yeah.
Death resurrection.
Death resurrection.
In order to get involved in it, you have to be Christed.
You have to be Christed.
It's something they call the water of life.
And remember Jesus went around flexing it that he got it.
If you'd asked me, lady at the well, who you know,
you know what was going on.
If you'd asked me, he said, she blew him off.
And he said, if you'd asked me, I'd
have given you the aqua wita, aqua witai, the water of life.
I've given it to you.
Well, you got access to that, she says?
You got access?
Yeah, Jesus with his 12 boys, he's got access.
Let's look at the drugs some more.
Can you feel it?
It's a little unsettling.
Thank you for staying, people.
Thank you for staying.
Who else are these people?
They're not only these pornois, these prostitute children.
They're also pharmacois.
They're people who use the farmaca, baby.
Right?
Did Jesus use the farmaca?
Damn straight he did.
Yes.
Oh, God.
He wouldn't have been able to be called the Christ that
one if he wasn't.
Yeah, he was into it.
Love it.
Love it.
Let's go to the next one.
Boom.
And finally, and he, you know, so he says, look,
this is, everything has come to boom.
Is that the gag going on?
This is how it is.
Boom.
So I'll come down to this.
Boom.
Eagle to alpha, kite to omega.
Yeah, I'm that beginning and that end, right?
And I'm going to give to the one.
I'm going to give to the one who's got the dipsass, who's
got the thirst.
I'm going to give him from the pege from the fountain
of that water that comes from Zoe.
Zoe, keep that in mind.
I want you to keep that in my Zoe.
We know who Zoe is.
Don't you know?
Didn't you know the water of life came from Eve?
Boy, you're confused now.
Did you not get an invitation to the fruit?
What happens?
Things get mixed up in the mail, I guess.
I want to go to the next one, please.
I want to take you now to a horse quickly.
OK, if you'll give me 20 more minutes,
I'll give you the best material that I can conjure right now.
Look at line.
I'm just going to hit you to the great points.
Look at line five.
This is in the Geoponica, Byzantine,
agricultural slash drug slash all sorts
of zoological stuff manual by a dude calling himself Zoro
Aster, this section is.
And in number five, he says, Hippos Rupaluku,
Brothes Agathos Estai, Kai Podokes.
Now, it's kind of strange the way that it's phrased.
But it fits in with all the rest of the description
that he provides perfectly.
He's being instances between sympathy and antipathy
and how they work in the universe.
And he says, the horse that is bitten by the wolf,
the horse that is bitten by the wolf, what happens to them?
They'll be good.
And they will be fast, fast.
Wait, what the horse that is bit by the Lukos?
He goes on to say, look at the next line.
He says, yeah, and Pamphilus says, in his bit on nature,
he says that the horses that walk in the wolf's path
ride, that enter that path of the wolf,
