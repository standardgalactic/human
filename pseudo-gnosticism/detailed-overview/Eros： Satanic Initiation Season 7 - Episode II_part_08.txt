He doesn't take center stage.
The dragon doesn't take, not even the beast, the antichrist.
They're all foils.
What are they foils for, Lady Babylon?
Let's go to the last text.
I want to bring you, I want you just to sit here.
I'm going to translate this thing really quick
and I want you to pretend that you are in this banquet.
We've come back to the late Bronze Age.
We're looking at Homer here, right?
So people who talk to you on YouTube and say,
oh, the Greek says this and the Greek says that.
There's people who talk about knowing Greek
and there's people who actually translate Greek.
Let's look at what happens here.
So there's a banquet going on.
I'll just set it up by saying there's a banquet going on
and we've all been crying in mourning, right?
Just know it, the audience, we've all been crying in mourning.
This has been some sad stuff going on.
So I'll start translating.
So Helen, the daughter of God,
the begotten of God.
Did you hear that?
You knew there was a son of God in the world,
but you didn't know that there was a daughter of God.
That doesn't even register on your brains.
Look how dull your brains are.
That that doesn't even register.
When I say son of God, people perk up.
Son of God, son of God.
When I say daughter of God, nobody hears it.
Well, here it is.
Helen, the son of God, the daughter of God.
What does she do?
She puts a drug into the wine and this thing,
they drank it then.
It's a napenthe.
It's a complete dissolver of pain and it's acholon.
It makes your attitude so that you're not angry.
Oh, cool.
It's a mood.
It's a modifier of your mood.
And yeah, yeah, yeah.
And it does what?
It makes you forget.
It's an epilatheic.
It's an epilatheon.
It is something that makes you forget
all of the bad that has happened to you.
So much so that whoever takes it,
now listen to this, you've come to the party
and you're gonna take this drug, right?
It's in the wine.
We're gonna get bockock.
And what are we gonna do, right?
Whoever takes it, when it's mixed into the wine,
what in the mixing vessel, what happens?
What happens for an entire 24 hour period?
This person's not gonna shed any tears.
Not even if his mother and his father die
right in front of him.
Not even if somebody takes out the bronze blade
and kills his brother or his most loved son, right?
Not even if he sees it with his own eyes.
Will he shed a tear?
This is the power that the daughter of God has
in the form of her drugs that are clever
and bringers of good.
This art was taught, was brought to us by Polly Domna.
She's the wife of Thon.
Who is this Thon guy?
Who gives it?
Who cares?
Thon didn't do anything in history.
Thon didn't do jack.
Thon was sitting around picking his backside, right?
But what did she do?
What did Thon's wife do?
Polly Domna.
What did she do?
She created all these drugs, man.
And where did she get it?
Well, you know how it works.
The Zedoros earth brought it to her in Egypt, right?
She's an Egyptian.
The Zedoros.
What is the Zedoros?
I just want you to see this.
Go to the last, what is something that Zedoros?
Zee giving.
Look everybody, look at this.
What is this?
Zee giving.
Does anybody know what that means?
Zee giving, and it's used of earth.
And look at number two, Roman numeral two.
Some authors derived it from Za'o.
Rides, that living principle.
Za'o, we get Zoe, it's the same root.
And meaning life, forgiving, right?
And it's used of Aphrodite.
Aphrodite, the life giver.
Aphrodite, isn't that gorgeous?
How do you have your love?
How do you have your eros?
You have it with the she who brings life.
Oh God, isn't that gorgeous?
But it's even deeper than that.
You still haven't gotten to the bottom.
Show me the next one.
Oh God, watch this people.
Watch this, Za'o.
Look at what it means.
It means to ferment, right?
To get hot.
To get hot and ferment.
Do you know what Aphrodite does?
She gets hot and she ferments.
She bubbles up.
She bubbles up and she boils over.
She boils over.
And in that sense, she exhales or she ejaculates, right?
And it's that essence of Aphrodite
that is the resurrection mystery.
Why are the Christians, take it down.
Why are the Christians warning you
not to hang out with the people who are using the drugs
