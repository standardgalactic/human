I do have a bow. This word's associated with bowing. Yes, it is. Look at, look at the next line.
There's another bow reference on the line after that. Another bow reference. My goodness. What
other kind of references do we get? We get the harp. We get the harp. Okay, stop. Pull it down,
Chewie, because you got to see the reality here. It's that stretching action. It's that thing that
brings that bowman and that musician into the same realm. It's the tension. It's the tension
of the cosmos. Those Presocratics are sitting around talking about tension. Nobody understands
what that means, right? It's the attunement. Do you hear the attunement? Those of you who, who fancy
the magic arts, particularly classical, the real stuff. You guys, you guys know what that means,
what that tension is. It's the power that drives everything. Why are we talking like this, Mr.
Guy, Mr. Titan, giant guy sitting next to me, talking to me. Tell me, Mr. Titan, your children
that are giants, what do they do? They make lightning. They make light, they make what?
They make lightning. Okay, now I'm in. Okay, these people are cool. No wonder,
people are afraid. Could you tell me a little bit more about the lightning here? Give me the next.
Boom. Let's just take the root. Let's just take the root of the oistress. What is the
oistress? That is that sting. That is that sting. It's also poison. It's also the power
to put you into an oracular place. And if you know Moses, he likes his oracles, right? He's
out in the desert, make him tense. Yeah, hearing the voice of God, bringing the voice of God,
right? Bringing the voice of God. And here we are to clip him. Are you ready? Here we're going to
get our chance to clip him. Look at these. Oistrate to Ekmine. This is Hesechius people.
He's a Greek who's writing about the Greek language. Forget about modern scholars. Are you idiots?
Are you idiots at Harvard, Yale, Stanford? All of the schools everywhere. Guess what? It turns
out the best definitions are from the Greeks themselves. Yeah, that's what we have to do.
Any good classist knows that, right? It's too bad. This generation following mine. I don't know
what happened to it. Broke down. Got soft, weak, not enough drilling. Need more drilling. People
like to be drilled. Drilling is good for you. It's good for the driller. It's good for the drilly.
What is the next one? Oistrate. To enter into that, you've heard the word idolatry,
the performance of those rites. That lat root is that. So it's the oyster with that regulating
lat root. And how does he define it here? I need to bring that up again, sorry.
Minotai. To be maniac. To be crazy. To be running around, pointing at ghosts that nobody else sees.
Yeah, we're talking about the mantic rites. You know what Heracles was? He was a mantic.
He was a mantic. Love it. Let's go back. Let's go back. Oh, there he is. That's nice. Who's that?
I don't know. He's got a nice hat. Go to the next. We've got to get these quick or else we're
going to lose them. Are you ready? Oystraplegos. That just means to be struck by the oysters,
right? To be in mania. It says in mania. Go up one. And I just want to grab those two bottom ones.
Look at this. Yeah, look at this. Prumanoi. Oh, wait a minute. We've got people who are doing
the oyster mania, who are entering into that state. And if you weren't invited to the right party,
you're not going to get there. This is a chemical process. The oysters is that madness
that is induced by the poison. Fantastic. They've got too much scopolamine and atropine
and high osciamine going on. These people are flooding themselves, right? They're inducing,
intentionally inducing mania. Now you understand why everybody's so afraid of them. Yeah,
they can hit you with an arrow. Next thing you know, you do a Mitch McConnell.
Is it too early? It's too early. It's too early. I listened to that man lie out of his lying tongue
for so many years. It felt good to see the fury stop him, cut him short. It felt good. And I'm not
afraid of them. I'm not afraid to say that. Everybody faces Moira. Everybody faces your
equalizing destiny. Yeah, yeah, we all think we're getting away. But we aren't fantastic. Welcome to
prison. That's the Caldean thing, right? It's punishment for all of us. Fantastic. Unless you
work for the place, in which case, it's fun. Fantastic. Let's go. Yeah, go ahead and go down one.
