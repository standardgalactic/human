translated to you as eternal.
And tonight, what I want to show you
is the world where eternal life doesn't exist.
It's nowhere in the Bible.
It is not a promise of eternal life.
It is a promise of Ionic life.
What is this thing?
Let's see.
Let's see an excellent false derivation of that.
More eternal life.
Bring us, bring it on.
You ghosts of the dead, bring on more eternal life.
And our life is there for life to the food, to the food.
And they shall never perish.
Neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.
The Bible says, barely, barely, I say in thee,
he that heareth my word and believeth on him
that sent me hath everlasting life
and shall not come into condemnation,
but is passed from death unto life.
Jesus said, and whosoever liveth and believeth in me
shall never die.
Believe us out this.
And if you believe on Christ, you'll never die.
There's some people think eternal life means life
that goes on and on and on and on and on and on
and on and on and on and on and on and on and on.
So the life they have now doesn't end.
They think life that just continues and doesn't stop.
No, eternal life is the rendering,
is the English rendering of the Greek Zoe.
Eternal life is used in the English language
to describe the life that only belongs
to the eternal.
The truth is the way of eternal life.
We need to be able to follow it.
Eternal life, eternal life.
Eternal life, eternal life, eternal life.
Only such.
Whoever believes in him should not perish
but have eternal life.
Do not keep that life changing truth to yourself.
And remember, you are love.
You are indeed.
Now, what is this thing they're talking about,
this Ionic life, and does it mean eternal?
Let us just go to the Ion.
The best place to go is back to the original.
