Go back to Alice.
And by the way, does anybody notice
how that preacher just snuck in a little bit of Greek?
And to you, it's believable, right?
To anybody who spends time reading Greek,
it's transparently bad.
Yeah, Zoe, let's eternal life, Zoe.
Thank you.
Let's go to Ion and see what is this thing Ionic life?
What is it?
Let's go to Ion.
Okay, please, beautiful.
Back to Alice, Alice.
Tell us, Alice, Ion.
Oh, lifetime, life, age, generation, long space of time.
Ion personified as the child of Chronos.
Oh, that's nice, that's nice.
I want you to look at just one word in Greek.
And let's bring up the Ion, big Ion.
Show us with the Derivate.
Oh, okay, okay, look at this, look at this, look at this.
Oh, this is gorgeous.
Look right in the middle here,
right here in space and time.
This way, look right here.
This is Ion, Ion, Alpha, Iota,
and what is that F looking thing?
That's a diagramma.
Can you say diagramma?
Yes, you know what that diagramma is?
It is from the Mycenaean Greek.
This is a very, very old word, Ion.
And where does it come from?
From 1600 BC?
Yes, wow.
Gorgeous, gorgeous.
Oh, is that lovely?
What is the, what is the Ion?
What is the Ion?
Before we can show you the Ion,
we have to step over the cadavers,
the terrible, terrible misconceptions and lies
that you have been fed by people
who's pretend to know Greek and tell you,
oh, it's from the Greek and it means this.
And they do not know it.
Can I get a Hail Satan?
Let's see it.
Let's see them in their foolery.
Let's go.
Please show us the,
Chewick, show us the false derivation,
the third clip that we've got, yeah.
If you know very much about the story of the Bible,
you've probably heard that Jesus offers eternal life.
Sounds nice, but what does Jesus mean by eternal life?
Well, Jesus adopted this phrase from the Hebrew scriptures.
In English, it's translated eternal life
or sometimes everlasting life.
But the phrase literally translated from Hebrew
is life unto the age.
Yeah.
Yeah, seriously?
Did he just say that?
It's adopted from the Hebrew
and you people just sit there, uh-huh, uh-huh.
It's adopted from the Hebrew.
I just showed you the Mycenaean.
The proto-Hebrew is the earliest 9th century BC.
This is not Hebrew.
This is not Semitic.
This is Greek in its oldest form,
at least the oldest recovered form of Ramsophon, right?
Let me, I think it's going to be back.
Let them, let them work on their end.
So the proto-Hebrew is,
to say that this is derived from Hebrew
