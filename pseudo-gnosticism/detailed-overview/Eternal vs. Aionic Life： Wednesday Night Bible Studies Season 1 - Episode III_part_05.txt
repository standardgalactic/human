Yeah, I love this.
The magical rod, wait, huh, lies in a cupboard
together with the sixth and seventh books of Moses.
Wait, Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
That's five, I thought it was called a Pentateuch.
Guess what?
Your world that you thought was so normal isn't.
There happened to be other books of Moses.
They just weren't accepted in El Canon.
Love it, okay.
We have the eight, would you like me to show you?
It survives in Greek.
Who wants to read the eight book of Moses?
You know you do.
You know you do, yeah, yeah.
Philemon has become old and so much fever-minded.
Yes, okay, so tell us, why is the rod?
The rod is laid upon the sixth and the seventh.
Perhaps it's the eighth, you could say.
What kind of rod, the serpent rod?
The serpent one that Jung brings to you
and profanes to you.
Remember, he wanted this buried with him, right?
And then released at a specific time.
What a, he's weird.
Now you know why restraints are so important with Carl.
With Dr. Jung, sorry.
Don't try to get personal.
Okay, fantastic.
Let's go on to the eighth book of Moses then.
Eighth book of Moses.
And I'm going to read you a section of that.
And you are going to perceive Ionic life.
Are you ready?
None of your people from Harvard are gonna give this to you
because they don't use these sources.
Shame on you.
When you were needed, Harvard.
Ivy League.
Nothing about the Ivy in that one.
Yeah, yeah, let's see.
Okay, I'll read it to you.
Let's see if we can find it.
I'm not quite sure which one is it.
Nope, nope.
Nope, nope.
Well, that's okay.
Take it down.
I'll read it to you, please.
Let me read it to you.
It's from the PGM.
You can get it yourself.
Hans Dieter Betz.
Yeah, it's the edition that Dr. John Scarborough
was one of the many translators for
who was the gentleman that I worked with.
Very nice, very nice.
I call on you, the creator of all,
who are greater than all.
Like that.
You, the self-begotten God,
who see all and hear all and are not seen.
Okay, do you have the mental image
this God is telling you about?
Calling on that unseen one.
For you gave Helios all the glory and the power,
slain the privilege to wax and wane,
and you have fixed the courses, yet you took nothing
from the earlier born darkness,
but assigned them equally, assigned them equality.
For when you appeared, both order arose and light appeared.
I like that, order and light appeared.
And all things were arranged by you.
Therefore, all things are also subject to you,
whose true form, none of the gods can see,
who take different forms in different visions.
Ion of Ion, Ion of Ion.
