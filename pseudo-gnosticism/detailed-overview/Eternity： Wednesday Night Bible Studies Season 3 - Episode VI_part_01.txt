Yeah, that's quite a right
They have tape recordings, they have tape recordings, right?
Running a big deal, right? Netflix, running a series on it, it's such a big deal
Yeah, so here we go, we get another one
But I rest assured all of my evangelical and Catholic visitors
Rest assured that your willingness to embrace these people is not odd
Despite their hideous actions
For your Lord himself screamed in the air when he was arrested in a public park
That he wasn't a child trafficker
He screamed it, not a child trafficker, what are you coming out with big guns?
Yeah, so it only makes sense that you would embrace this tradition
Welcome to prison
Your punishment is to face your reality
Yeah, so suck my tongue
Yeah, love it, love it, okay, lock that guy up, I don't care what his shirt says
I don't care if he's got an ST in front of it, lock him up, this is the devil's throne
Love it, it's good to see everybody not here again, but I know that you're there
And tonight I want to take us to some, oh, we're going to set the ship for the 15th
And we're going to fall into a time and a place where I'm going to take us to a pagan kingdom
A pagan kingdom, it's guarded, it's guarded by a guy who's part of the Order of the Dragon
Yeah, yes, you know what I'm talking about
He had a poet friend who fought with him
And from that poet's pin comes all from beginning to end
We're talking about Maroulas, Mike, I call him Mike
Mike is writing this amazing, amazing Orphic poetry, neoclassical Latin cult poetry
He's got the Medusa staring you in the face using the very same terminology that we've been following this whole time
So where do I want to take you? Through the 15th century, I'm going to catch, this is just the way time and space works
I'm going to catch a river, it's like a stream that pushes you, accelerates you
And I'm going to get us back to the Bronze Age, but I'm going to do it through this window that we've got
And that window is provided to you by the pagan that stands between the monotheists
Fish, watch the gestures, watch the gestures fish, it's the way the language is spoken
He knows what I'm talking about
Let's go now to Mike Maroulas and let's pull up who we're going to be invoking
We're going to be singing an invocation, warning to those of you who don't like such things
You should bail now, because this is the heart of Demogorgon
This is the heart of Demogorgon, this is that deep thing of Satan that we're bringing up tonight
Are you ready? Put yourself in the place of the pagan who fights the monotheists
He's got Christian army on one side, Muslim army on the other
And they all want the same thing
So, let's look at what his poet says
I'm going to read you a passage, we don't have the Latin for this
I'm going to put on my glasses
This is the, yeah, no, that's coming up, we're coming up
I'm building up to bring you to that inner chamber, I want to show you Eitanitas
To show you who she is, but in order to get to that Bronze Age religion
We have to go through the Celestials
You say what? Yeah, yeah, the Celestials
We are back looking at the sun, we are back looking at the sun
Do you know when the Saturnian age emerges?
It emerges when the sun is put into eclipse
