Right, that's what they called him, right?
Because his father was the Dracula
He was the Draco, Dracon
In the Latin, right?
Right through the creek
Oh, God, it's delicious
It's ethereal
Your courage never failing
And now taking pity on labors and kingdoms here below
Doomed soon to fall
Like Atlas
You sustain the ponderous weight
Of the tottering ruins
At other times you rouse the indolent
With countless secret rites
Since you are free of all envy
Do you hear the call?
Do you hear the call
Of the virgin on the acropolis?
She who nourishes the snake
Yes, yes
At other times you rouse the indolent
With countless secret rites
Since you are free of all envy
And you remove mines and clothes
In their dark prisons
From the stigma of impiety
In your great kindness you rescue the ship
Already at the mercy of raging tempests
Come, come here
Blessed and most holy purification
Of heavenly beings and of men
So what are we doing?
We're setting, we're using that hymn
To set up where we are in the investigation, right?
The pollards came down and it turns out
There's enough to indict
There's enough to explain why he's there
And for those of you who are following
The mystery of the mystery
That includes dragon tongue
For those of you who are following it
We come to a very special place
I'm about to take you into the cave, right?
We stand at the entrance of the cave of eternity
Those rites that everybody are calling mystery
Those rites come from this cave
And that cave is guarded by a dragon
The hymn to eternity
I'll pull up the latin, just let you
