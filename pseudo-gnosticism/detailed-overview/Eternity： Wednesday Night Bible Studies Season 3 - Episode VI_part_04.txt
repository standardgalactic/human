Let's just let some of this slide off
Ipsa mihi wokim atque adamantina
Sufi keplektra
Dunga neres priorque ausis ingintibus asis
Immensi regina aiui
Kwae luki datimpla aitheres augostosque
Tenens augusta rekesus
Yeah, yeah
Give me
Create in me
Your voice
And provide to me eternity
Your unbreakable plectrum
Your plectrum is the thing that you play your instrument with, right?
Wait, what?
We're invoking a goddess
Okay, I see what we're doing
We're bringing the image
And we're doing it through the plectrum
That's nice
Do all of this while you are celebrated in song
Why else would you invoke the muse, right?
Yes
And be present for my daring actions
Oh, Queen of the vast IWUM
Queen of the ION
You and I have been looking at the ION
Do you remember that there was a fellow who told you
He'd give you a life of the ION?
He could give you IONIC life, you
You, you, you through your Latin trickery
Thought he said, I Tarnitas
He didn't
He didn't
He said IONIC
This is the life of the ION
This is what we have to offer
Look into the cave
See her sitting there
You who hold the shining temples of the ether
You who hold the shining temples of the ether
Again, if you're not following the physics
Don't worry, stick with the analog
You who hold the lucid temples of the ether
And those deep corners that have been brought to perfection
Oh, most perfect Augusta
What is Augusta? He calls her Augusta
You say, wait a minute, strike two
Strike two, I smell Romans
I smell Romans around here
