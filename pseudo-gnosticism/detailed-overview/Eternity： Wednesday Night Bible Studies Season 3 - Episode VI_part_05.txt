Romans and Etruscans
You can always smell that Etruscan
From 30 feet away
Those Etruscans
They wear that stuff
And it gives off a very distinct odor
Yes, it does
You can always tell when they're around
Here they are
Somebody wanted odors
Is that a good odor for you?
Fantastic
You smell them, the Romans
As soon as you start
As soon as you start worshipping Augusta
You are square
You are square on that boot
Square
Love it
Love it, love it, love it
She is Augusta
Yeah
With your peace
You're establishing all things
You who are Beata
Most fortunate
Most fortunate
Yes
Whom youth follows
Youth, juenta
Wait a minute, strike three
There we are
We have a triad
We have a trinity
We have a group of three divinities
Wow, look at that
In an invocation
In a pagan invocation
From the 15th
That's marvelous
Those guys always miss it
I'll give them credit
We gotta give credit where credit is due
And those German philologists in the 30s
We're putting together all the texts
Leipzig
That group, you guys were great
You were crack
You were crack
But because you didn't have that Victorian edge
