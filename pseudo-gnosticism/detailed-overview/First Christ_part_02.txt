I'll push you through the program.
Yeah, listen to my voice and do everything I say.
You'll be reading Greek.
Now, let's get this thing started.
Chewie, give me the next,
I'm going to give myself one more comment.
Trying to watch the video at the gym,
but creepy Jesus and boy pictures
are making me look like an absolute weirdo.
Isn't that great?
This is fantastic.
Thank you, Chief Gull.
Thank you, Chief Gull, for taking us on a workout.
That's fantastic.
Are you doing it now?
Everybody, right?
Come on, come on, do it.
He's looking at pictures of Jesus.
Yeah, ew, Jesus.
Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Give me the next one.
Why hail Satan while claiming not to be religious
or a Satanist, right?
Which, you know, I'm not.
It is to make a point.
Wait, wait, is it to make a point?
What is the point?
Or is it simply to excite Christians?
It does all of that stuff.
It's wonderful watching you go through the process, Jim.
It's watching you go through the process.
Look at what happens here.
He says, I am fascinated.
Oh my God, Jim.
Jim, did you know?
Did you know what fascination is?
Everybody, what is a foske, you know?
It is an ancient, prior to us,
an ancient erection, a phallus, a dildo.
There's lots of different ways to say it,
but that's what it is.
Fascination is when somebody points that at you.
They pointed at you, Jim, right?
I'm fascinated.
I'm rooted.
I'm not going anywhere.
The predator's out there and he's looking at me.
Oh, God.
Love it.
Let's see if it works today.
How are people uncomfortable?
People, get uncomfortable out there.
Hail Satan, right?
Everybody, hail Satan.
Why do I say hail Satan?
Look at...
No, no, this isn't...
No, that's okay.
It was the last one, give me...
Yep, that's okay.
I'm still a boy coming out of a cave.
Oh no, how do we get...
Come on, man.
The truth still makes me close my eyes and shock
like the night rays, right?
Okay, after being in the dark solo.
Look, this is a process.
People have always communicated this
and I try to explain it to them as you're peeling back
that unreality that floats around you
and has been crammed down your throat all your life.
The thing that you've been breathing, right?
It's become a part of you as you're unrooting that.
You're gonna pull up things like confusion.
You're gonna pull up things like uncertainty, right?
That's all okay.
That's the part of, you know,
and when you're in a laboratory
and you're doing experiments,
you got the same anxieties.
You have the same transformations.
As you walk on that path of reason, baby, right?
You can't go wrong.
Just hang in there on the path.
I had you playing, yeah, fantastic.
Let's go to the next one.
There was one we missed.
There was a good comment we missed
and I wanna get on to the meat.
Maybe it's this one.
Get that one, Chewy.
Okay, why he'll say it as I wanna finish this?
Claiming not to be religious.
Is it to make a point, et cetera?
I'm fascinated and confused.
Seems very honest.
I love the choice not to be tainted by the filth.
I like this.
That is merging truth with monetization.
People, listen here to Jim for one minute.
Thank you, Jim.
Just want the chance here to recognize
we're not tainting this with the filth of monetization.
What a novel.
What a novel thing.
Now, tonight I wanna bring you something.
It'd be a little bit shocking
and it's gonna take us out of our typical shoes
and put us into somebody else's sandals.
It's an orgy.
I'm bringing you back to the bucket orgy again.
