We're gonna see a description of one
and you're gonna find somebody there
that's going to surprise you.
What is he doing in a bucket orgy?
Fantastic.
Give me the first, roll up the first
start chart there when you can Chewy.
Okay, here we go.
Look, people, what is this?
Now, everybody in the room,
this is one thing I love here
because everybody in the room who is not a classicist,
look at this and said, wait a minute.
I thought I learned Greek, right?
Is that Greek?
But it doesn't, look, it's odd.
It's weird.
There's words there that I've never seen before.
Oh my God.
Yes, this is notice.
This is notice and notice writes a giant epic.
It's the longest Greek epic about Dionysus.
So you can imagine there are descriptions
in dactylic hexameter.
What notice has done that you can't appreciate
from this text and I really can't appreciate it
like I should either.
But this is written in dactylic hexameter.
This thing is meant to be performed as a religious right.
It's got the cadence that we use if we're symbols.
It's got the Orphic meter.
Fantastic.
And I want to say, just right from the top,
what does it say?
Are you ready?
Picture this, we're going,
bucket orgy and you help me find the person who's there
that you wouldn't think would be at one.
All of the people gathered together
in order to generate that bucket song performed
during the evening revels.
Fantastic.
So we're gonna give this bucket revel.
What do we do?
We establish the rights.
It is through the bucket revel
that the mystery is executed.
Anytime Jesus talks about mystery,
Paul talks about mystery.
We're talking about a very specific operation
like the one Jesus is performing
in the Garden of Gethsemane.
Here we go.
Who's at this bucket orgy?
Oh my God.
We've got the drums.
We've got the drums playing, you know what I mean?
And people are dancing and what else is happening?
The torches are torching, baby.
They're just all brilliantly lit up.
These are torch lit.
Right, so you gotta get a little bit of the ambience
if you want the real mystery, you know what I mean?
This is way, way older than any of the mysteries
that you've been taught about.
Lovely.
And what happens here?
What happens here?
Oh my God.
Look at the last four lines, people.
Look at the last four lines.
The women, the women step up.
And what do they produce?
They produce a song.
They produce a song that is the Thelus Ioe,
third line from the bottom.
The women's shout.
Oh God, where do they put it?
They put it into the air.
Oh God, they seed the air with their cries.
And what are they doing?
They're creating.
They're creating a communion.
A communion that is the life energizer.
The life magnifier.
The life mania.
Okay.
Bacchic women.
I want you just to look at the one, two, three, four, five,
six lying down.
Look at the second word in the six lying down.
Chrionto.
Chrionto.
Wait, what does this say?
It says that the followers of Bacchus
are Christed.
It says the followers of Bacchus are Christed.
What are they Christed with?
They're Christed with a chalk.
Sometimes it's an earth.
You have to know how they're doing medicines.
Sometimes it's an earth.
It's a sediment that is made into a clay
that dries upon the face.
And they put it on their cheeks
so that the burning purple will be captured.
That come the burning purple that they've put in their eyes.
This is for the oyster mania.
This is the Christing that brings the salvation
or the health, right?
Without this Christing,
