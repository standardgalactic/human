We're calling on iobajos.
That very first line, iobajos.
And what is iobajos doing here?
He is gathering his women
and his horned satyrs together.
And he is entering the Bacchic mania
for the sake of conflict.
When he sees his enemy,
the defender of that city of Argos.
And what does he do?
He holds up his thersis.
He holds up his wand.
This is the one with the serpents on it.
This is the one with the serpents on it.
Does somebody see Moses?
Does somebody see what the author
of the third century Septuagint,
who's writing the Bible in Greek?
Do you see what he did?
He took Bacchus and made him Moses,
the follower of the muses,
aka Musaeus.
Now, I didn't make that up, right?
I didn't figure that out.
Over time, I might have figured that out.
But I didn't.
They did in antiquity.
You mean people challenged Moses in antiquity?
Yes, why?
Because before the third century, he didn't exist.
There's no quotes.
Can you believe Moses would write his books
way back in like 1200,
maybe as early as 13, 1400 BC.
But he would write them way back then
and nobody between then and all the way down
in the third century would ever quote them.
Nobody'd make a vase and put a word on it
and he, those don't exist?
Nope.
Somebody said the other night,
a theologian stood on this stage
and said to you via a clip that I played.
Yeah, he said Hebrew literature.
Let me alert you to something right now.
There is no Hebrew literature.
It doesn't exist.
You have the Septuagint.
That's it.
Nothing is quoted.
You don't have anybody in Pendar's Day quoting.
Oh, let's quote Moses.
Quote Moses, right?
What you do have, that's because the language was dead,
right?
Hebrew was long dead by then.
What you do have in Greek writings
like diascordes in the first century,
he'll talk about the name for specific drugs
and he'll say, oh, the Babylonians call it this.
The Romans call it this.
The Greeks call it this.
Talk about North Africans.
What do they call it?
And oh, the Hebrews call it this.
So we know, we know that there's the concept
of the language in the society,
but we know it's not being used.
It's not even showing up in the synagogues.
It's irrelevant.
The Torah is a fictional work from the third century BC.
Let me say that one more time.
I'm gonna say that I want it to make the impact
that it should because if you understand this,
and it calls into question a lot, the big three,
the monists man have a problem with this.
They can't live with this, right?
No, they can't live with this
because it means Moses and Abraham and Noah are all made up.
Now, let me give you an example of the concrete reality
of what I'm trying to expose for you.
When I was at Tel Makedo, which is in Israel
and it's the reputed side of Armageddon.
Isn't that nice?
When I was there, there was a building
way over the temple, right?
Layer-wise, way over.
Probably Iron Age, probably Iron Age.
And they were already calling it the building of Solomon.
They had it named already.
Do you know how dishonest that is?
That is what Israel Finkelstein fought against.
He's telling everybody, hey, this stuff,
this kingdom of Israel stuff,
there's no fucking evidence for this.
Excuse me.
There's no archeology for this.
Well, it's the same thing on the writing side.
There is no Hebrew.
Well, weren't there only in the idea
there were older Hebrew texts?
Yeah, that's the idea, but that wasn't a reality.
There weren't any texts, huh?
You mean ancient Hebrew is no different
from Oscar and Umbrian from Italy,
that they had a very small vocabulary
and eventually got swallowed up
by a more proficient language like Latin or Greek, right?
Yes, yes, that's what happened.
When you go into those ancient synagogues
and you look, what's there?
