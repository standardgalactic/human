Well, since we're in the Thesmaphoria, next text, please, we're going to be looking at
Thymus because the Thesmaphoria is all about Thymus.
You thought this was Bible studies.
It is Bible studies because you're here to watch.
You're here to witness an actual mystery.
If you don't understand what a mystery is, how can you possibly ever read the Bible?
Think about it.
Yeah.
How can you ever read the Bible?
How can you pretend to read the Bible?
I've had seminarians tell me I was right.
You can't.
You can't.
You have to jump into the crime scene.
You have to look around.
You have to take things.
There are clues here.
I'm going to give you the clues now.
Let's look at the clues and follow it.
Let's go to Thymus.
Why are we at the Thesmaphoria to honor Thymus?
Thymus.
You'll notice Urano, Paede, Hagnene, Calleo, Thimen, Eopatraean, Pateraean.
Excuse me.
Gaia Stablastema, Neen, Calucopi da Coren.
That Calucopi da Coren, take it off, that Calucopi, that Calyx-faced Cora is who we're
talking about with Thymus.
Who is Thymus?
Thymus is what we bring women in the rites of the Thesmaphoria.
Yeah.
Remember, we've beaten all the men away with sticks.
Right?
Can't come.
Right?
Why?
I don't know.
Maybe it's because only you can do it.
This is Lady Babylon after all, right?
So we're all here and we're looking at these, we're looking at these bringing her, Thymus,
into a reality.
And I just want you to notice in that second line, that Calucopida, that face, what is
her face?
What is her alps?
It is the face of the bud, the Calyx, protecting that bud, right?
The new, fresh, Thymus, the Coren, right here, it's Coren, do the dialect, right?
Yeah.
