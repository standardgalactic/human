So we get their groups scattered in different places, with different people claiming to
be the ancestors of that original group of Polaskians.
And you can put your connection to the Etruscans right there.
So what is happening in the language, what is happening in the language, the, bring us
up that last hymn line again.
Thank you, Chewy.
Yeah.
How is this translated?
Yeah.
Well, it's translated terribly here.
I'll just read to you.
I'm sorry, Dr. Athanasakis, but you know, you can take it.
You can take it.
Yeah.
And here's his translation, whose skin, when she was pregnant, he mangled in anger.
Yeah.
He's trying to form this, but wait, he's trying to form, I'm sorry, he's trying to form this
to his preconceived notion of the myth.
You know, this is done all the time.
Don't worry about it.
It's translators have to try to make sense of things.
But if this is de somatone from the Etruscan side, and it's leaking in here, then what,
which makes sense in the right, right, to write for the Korah, then what is the espace?
That really is the word for drawing.
Yes.
Yes.
For drawing or sucking, drawing out, drawing out.
What's happening?
Now is drawing out the God bodied sustained flesh, the God sustained flesh.
And it's whose flesh?
It's the Korah's flesh.
And where is this flesh going?
It's going through my, it's going into the, into the breath, into the understanding.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So here we have a reference to some kind of consumption of something, some kind of, well,
here's the fun thing about classics.
If we know that we're in the context of a hymn, and we know that this hymn is being sung
during performance, during a cult performance.
And we know that these mysteries, and we can get just a little tiny look inside the mysteries,
we thought you guys were getting the mysteries, right?
Weren't you for 55, 95?
That's not how it works.
Or if you go into Harvard, Japan, you guys are paying $60,000 a year, right?
Anyway, you can't sell it.
So let's look inside.
