It's powerful stuff
And it's got half a DZ accident
And that's why we have little children
All over the New Testament
Little children getting touched
Little children getting scandalized
Little children ending up in tombs
This guy has so many naked children around him
Have you ever wondered who showed up?
Who showed up at his tomb?
Who showed up at his tomb?
Women
Women
Who they call prostitutes
Yeah
Women
He was constantly trying to keep them safe
And they knew Jesus was associated with prostitutes
He's got something going on
If we're in an investigation about why
That naked boy was with him in a public park
We know that he's performing pimp-like protections
For these women
They show up at his death
They show up
And there's a kid there
Inside his tomb
Before this group can even get to him
We know the Bible tells us
He's not associated with prostitutes and accountants
So he's got something going on
Peter's not the only one who's knocking off people for cash
He's not the only one
He knows how this act works
He's not the only one who's immune to the Venoms
These guys have the Venoms on board
This is some major, major stuff
And this Samaritan woman
Who steps up and steps into the breach
She stands against his racism
Because you know why the Jews and the Samaritans fight
Because the Samaritans worship a woman
Isn't that something?
They worship a woman
Nobody saw that with a Samaritan woman
We have Christianized her
We've taken that Samaritan woman
We have Christianized her
You will hear people preaching from the pulpit
You will hear feminists talk about her
And then we have completely
Sturcified her image
Completely
This is a woman who worships a woman
You're not going to tell me to get you water
You've got water in life
Show me
Show me
You think you're the Christos?
Is that what you think?
And there's something lovely that happens in the middle of this conversation
She says to him in the Greek
You think you're that one, the messias?
The one they call Christos
That was the name
The messiah wasn't the name for the dude
Within the right
The Christ was the name for the dude
And the Samaritan points it out
Why?
Because she worships the lady who's the head of everything
Who brings you that burning purple
She brings you that ionic life
You think Jesus came on the scene
And just made the stuff up?
You think just asked me hello?
Do you really believe the fairy tale?
Can we have some fairy tale music please?
Little fairy tale. Chewie hit it
There she is
There she is in the fairy tale
Yeah, with Jesus
Turns out gangster G comes up and brings his brand
Up to them
He brings it up
He's like I'll get you water life
You'd be sitting in a, you'd be sitting in a tomb for three days
Totally gone
Yeah, yeah
We'll bring you out of it
