We've been here
I showed you the documents
You've seen this stuff
You guys know where we are
We need to go into that dark harbor
In order to do that
We're going to pull out Seneca
I just want to read you a little bit of Seneca
I just want you to relax and enjoy
I'm going to put my glasses on
We're going to see cult for the first time
It might get a little dark
It might get a little bit PG-13 rated
But we're going to take a look
This is Medea
She says, I loosen my hair from its bands
After the manner of my people
With bare feet
I trod the secret groves
And called forth rain from dry clouds
Get a picture of her
And who she is
Get a picture
We need to look at Sitha
That Sithi and Queen
We need to take a look at her
Surrounded by her Medusa
Fantastic
I have driven the seas back
To their lowest depths
And the ocean is tide's outdone
Shrushing waves further into the land
This is the woman who stands
This is the woman who stands
And in like manner with Heaven's law confounded
The world has seen both sun and stars together
And you, you bears
Have bathed in the forbidden sea
The order of the seasons I have changed
The summer land has blossomed
Beneath my magic song
And by my compelling series
Has seen harvest and wintertime
Fossus, the river
Has turned his swift waters backwards
To their source
One of the rivers of the four
That surrounded Edim
Edim
And mere magic, Edim
Is the Medwa
Yeah, fantastic
Those four rivers ran out everywhere
Those of you who think about the garden
You should be
Yeah, wonderful
Excellent
The waves have roared
The mad sea swelled
Though the winds were still
The heart of the ancient woods
Has lost its shadows
When the bright day has come back to them
A commandment of my voice
Yeah
Focus imperio me idea reducto
It's a beautiful line in Latin
Yeah
By the command of my voice
By my voice's imperium
The day is led back
Do you see how unnatural this is?
Right? It is that female voice
Standing
It's the order against it
Yes, it's gorgeous
Gorgeous, love it, love it, love it
Phoebus has halted in mid-heaven
That's the sun, right?
Phoebus has halted in mid-heaven
The Hyades moved by my incantation
Taunted to their fall
The hour is at hand, oh Phoebe
For your sacred rites
This is Medea
Who is speaking to Phoebe
Who is in two senses
The Britomart
Yeah, she is that
Artemisian or that
