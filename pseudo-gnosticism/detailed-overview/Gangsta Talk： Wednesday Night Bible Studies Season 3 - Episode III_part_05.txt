Dianic force
Yes, yes
She is also
The Lucifera
The Lucifera
Yeah, the bringer of that light
The bringer of dawn
We see in this invocation
We also talk about the attributes
That are given to Aphrodite
And people say
We're invoking Hecate here
We very much are
But when you look at the epithets
That are used for Hecate
When you look at the images
Orphic hymns that are used for Hecate
And then you cross those
Phucis, Urania
It called her
They are the same
And the culmination is in the line
Medusa
She is the one who guards
The air
The water
And the earth
She is that one who guards
All of those realms
All of those angles of existence
We're talking about the quantum
And the fact that you can't observe something
Without changing it
Yeah, the fact that you can't
Observe something without changing it
Yeah
Yeah, let's continue
Let's get into the
Into the riot
Let's see what she's actually doing
To you I offer these wreaths
Wrought with bloody hands
Earth each entwined
With nine serpent coils
What does she offer?
What does Medea have to offer?
What does this woman at the well have to offer?
Serpent coiled wreaths
Yeah, serpent coiled wreaths
Serpent coiled wreaths
Gorgeous
To you
These serpent limbs
Which rebellious tiffius wore
Who caused Joe's throne to tremble
Are we still in Samaria?
Yep, we are
We're still there
We're with a woman
Whose people caused the throne
Of Joe's
Jehovah's seat
To tremble
Yeah, this is lovely
It gets real druggy here, watch
Watch this
In this is the blood
Which Nessus, that traitor
Ferryman, bestowed
As he expired
With these ashes
The pyre sank down
Which drank in the poisoned blood
Of Hercules
Nessus' blood is poisoned
Hercules' blood is poisoned
There's a reason she's the medusa
She's six foot six
Looks like a twelve year old
Before she was born
They were bathing her through her mother
In the venom
You know what happens
When you do that
You get the medusa
People are surprised
That was a thirteen year old girl
I found, Sylvia
Looks like she's the head of an army
Yeah
