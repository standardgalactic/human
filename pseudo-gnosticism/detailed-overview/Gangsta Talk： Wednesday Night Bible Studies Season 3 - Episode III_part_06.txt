Yeah, you're right
You're right
These feathers, the harpy left
When she fled from the ETs
And to these
The quills of the wounded symphalian bird
Which felt the darts of Lerna
We're talking about bows
And drugs
You have given forth
Your voice, you altars
Wait a minute
What's happening
She is hearing
The voice from the altar
Why are we doing this?
Don't worry, Moses has that
Tent in the wilderness
Where you can sit there
You can take in all those drugs
That are coming off of that altar
You can face the snake
The serpent on the
On the rod
And you can have the voice of God
Speak from the oracle
Guess what Medea is doing
Is this odd? Should we find this odd?
No, Pendar says
That she preserved the oracle
Right, there's an oracle of Medea
Right?
And who is she speaking to?
She's speaking to the first oracle
Phoebe
Isn't that gorgeous?
That's gorgeous
Yeah, I see
Trivious with gliding car
Not as one radiant with full face
She drives to live long night
But as one ghastly with more full aspect
Harried by the salient threats
She skirts the nearer reign
Of edge of heaven
So do you
Shed from your torch a gloomy
Light through the air
Terrify the peoples
With nude red
And let precious Corinthian bronze
Resound Dictina
To your aid
She's invoking Critomartis
Right?
She's invoking the Poison Shutter
Eok Ira
Eok Ira is what the Greeks call her
Yeah
To you
On your altar's bloody turf
We perform your solemn rites
To you a torch caught up
From the midst of a funeral pyre
Has illumined the night
To you
Here's the right
Tossing my head
And with bended neck
I have uttered my magic words
For you
Lying in funeral
Passage
A band
Binds my flowing locks
For you is brandished
The gloomy branch
From the Stygian stream
Now for those of you with ears to hear
And for those of you who are just
Super into
People like Virgil
You'll understand
You'll see the images and you'll know
The miraculous cult
Kuma
Why?
Because that's where we go into the underworld
This is the quantum part
We have to open up that
