Underworld
You didn't think Jesus was arrested
In a public park with a naked boy
You didn't think the woman at the well
Was a hero
Standing up against a gangster
But now you do
Now you're seeing it
We've got to go into the abyss itself
We've got to find that place
What does she say?
What does Medea say?
Gifts staying to my poisons
A day when they ain't a steam loss
Give that power
To move
To my drugs
Give that power
And in my gifts
Keep hitting the seeds of fire
The seeds of fire
Are in your poison
What does she start to do?
She starts to cut herself
She starts to cut herself
And remember these medusa
They carry the poison in their hair
They have it constantly there
The arrow poisons
In this passage Nero points out
It's all about the bow
Says Medea
Arcus
Arcus
Bow
It's all grounded in that poison
In that communion
And Medea even says
After she's
Around the time that she's identified
Is Lucifer
She talks about
Her sacred latte case
Her sacred latte case
What is latex?
What is that?
A milky white juice
That comes off the opium poppy
When you cut it
Now it doesn't have to be just
Opium
Can be any juice
Any juice
Excretion
That transfers
From
The source
To the participant
The Ionic life
The eye opening
Medea says
Her blood
Is that life
Is that life
She
Is the Christ
She is the savior
More than a thousand years
Before Jesus ever existed
Jesus
Ganks to G
Knows what he's doing
He comes back
After they told him
The magi told him
This dude's going to be the king of everything
He goes down to Egypt
He gets his education
He's got his drugs with him
He's got a ton of frankincense and myrrh
He's got the very elements
That you mix everything else in
Jesus
Was using drugs so
Heavily
His
Education of the mystery was constant
Unceasing
We're going to look
Over the next couple of weeks
