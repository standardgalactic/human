What happens when you're under the influence
Of
This communion
We're going to talk about that thirst
We're going to look into the cult
We're going to see Jesus
By the way, he got popped in the end
He got popped, someone turned on him
He got handed over
For justice
We're having a debate with Neil
About Jesus getting handed over
Paul says
He got handed over
That's used
For giving somebody to the authority
So that they can find justice
Bring to justice
Jesus got brought to justice
He got brought to justice
In the end
He's yelling, remember the same guy
The same cocky gangster
Who's standing there
Who's standing there with this
Woman
Of Samaria
Who is the gall
To stand in his face when he's a man
Right
Says, you know who I am
That same guy who's saying
I've got the juice that you will never
Thirst again
That same guy screaming out
From across
I'm so thirsty
I'm so thirsty
Ah
And he's screaming magical phrases
Yeah
Sabakthon
Sabakthon
You know who appreciates Sabakthon
Those Samaritans that are looking for the Christos
Which the Jews call
Messias
You see how it works? You've been looking in the wrong
You thought you were looking in the entrance
You're looking in the exit
Right, we've got to get back there
We've got to get back to those times
So over the next
That's our 30 minutes
That's all the devil gives me
But over the next
Couple of Bible studies
I want to go to these places
So that you can see
The cult and operation
You can see this person
Who enters that
Phase
Who enters the Eremon
Who enters
That place where the heavens are open
Where Uranos
Is able to transmit
And I want you to see what that brings
I want you to see it
I want you to realize those seven stars
That Jesus holds in his hand
Those seven stars
Are the same
Seven stars that Medea uses
To form the cup
The cup of the sacred communion
Yeah
Jesus Christ
Was high
High
On venoms
High on venoms
Yeah, somebody just wrote to me and said
I get this
A lot
Where people say, you said that
And I didn't believe you
But now I saw something
And now you were right
