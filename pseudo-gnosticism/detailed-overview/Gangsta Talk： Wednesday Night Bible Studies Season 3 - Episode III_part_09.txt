And I'm amazed that you're right
And I'm some sort of
You know
Constant plotter
Of dark deception
Right, no, so
Scorpion turns out
Scorpion venom is the most expensive
Solution on the planet
Right, turns out
Pound for pound
It's the most expensive
And why is that
Well, I don't know
I can tell you in antiquity
They were using it
Yeah, using it in these weird
Weird stuff they were doing
But it was medical too
Yeah, they weren't just smoking these things
Like they do in Pakistan, right
They were in antiquity
They were integrating it with the medicine
Yeah, you got to get that body
Remember the polypharmacy
Shout out to the
Gentlemen
Pharmacologists
Neuro pharmacologists
Who contacted me
Shout out to you
Yeah
Because you know the art
You know what's going on
Yeah, imagine that
The next level of pharmacology
Making the patient
The
Manufacturer of the drug
You can give people things
To make them
Produce the drug
That you need to
To reach that
Ionic
Persistence
They say it makes you live a long time
They said she looked like she was 12 years old
It didn't make sense, Medea, right
Why is she looking like she's 12 years old
And she leads the army
Why is she the only one who can stand up
Against the other guys
Who have the bow poisons
Why is she the only one that can stand up against them
Why is she the master of the purple
It's because she's producing it
She is producing the communion
Her bodily
Substance
Is our communion
This is
1100 years before that
Gangsta G ever showed up in Samaria
To give them
To give them a hard time
Yeah, thank you for coming tonight
Thank you for coming tonight
I hope the microphone is
Helping with the audio
And
I'm going to have a meeting
With some people after
I need a few minutes to take a break
But for the next couple
Of sessions that we have
I'll be
Pushing
We're going to increase the speed here
We're halfway through
We're approaching the midpoint
So we need to speed
We need to pick up our pace there
So that you can feel your productivity
Is kicking in
Yeah, thank you for staying with us tonight
Thank you for being here
Hail Satan
