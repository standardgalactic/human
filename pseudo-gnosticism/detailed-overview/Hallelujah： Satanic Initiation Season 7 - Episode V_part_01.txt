Why ganymede?
Because ganymede gives something to Zeus.
Actually take it down, Chewie,
and get us whatever mind-bending pictures you've got.
Because ganymede is going to take us to Zeus.
Well, who is ganymede?
Oh, isn't that nice?
There he is.
You thought I was just making up stories.
No, look, here they are.
Fantastic.
Ganymede, what does he do?
He bears the cup for Zeus.
He bears the cup.
What does that mean?
Well, that's on two levels, people, okay?
And we know it, because you and I,
did you see that Roman Hitchhiker we picked up
a few weeks ago, who's been on Time Spaceship?
Yeah, he's influencing us subconsciously.
Yeah, and what he's doing is he's telling us,
look, we know what the ganymede is.
The ganymede's the cup.
If you are following the Pripyek poems,
which are old Roman poems,
hymns and whatnot, little ditties, epigrams,
all sorts of stuff, man.
Pripyek, and what do they say in the Pripyek?
Ganymede has the anal cup.
Yes.
Zeus drinks from Ganymede and Hebe.
Hebe, did you just say Hebe?
I did.
Do we have a picture?
Fantastic.
Hebe, notice, notice.
She looks like she may be young.
It's because youth, youth is what her name means.
Okay, remember, we worship the gods.
We're not like Christians and Jews.
We do not become honest and worship one force
at the expense of all the others.
We worship youth in antiquity.
Hey, who doesn't want to be young?
Who doesn't want to be young?
Do you know the Son of God?
Who's the Son of God, Mary?
You guys don't know it.
You don't know who the Son of God marries.
It's Hebe.
It's youth.
And what does Hebe do?
Youth gives ambrosia to the Olympians.
She's the source of Olympian ambrosia.
What is ambrosia?
What are ambrosia and nectar?
Right, because Ganymede's tromping around with the nectar.
He's got that nectar.
And youth, she's got the ambrosia.
And what is she doing?
If she doesn't give us that,
we don't live forever.
You mean that's what the Greeks thought?
Yes, let me say this to you,
and I want you to use everything practiced
up until this point, mentally, mentally.
If you don't feed the gods,
ambrosia and nectar, they die.
They become immortal.
Their mortality is burned off by their own ikor.
And what is ikor?
That is what flows in your veins.
That's what Medea removed from Telos.
Yeah, yeah.
And if you don't have it from Hebe and Ganymede,
you don't have your mortality burned off.
Yeah, did you think that the, yeah, right?
It's a system has to work according to the laws of physics.
Right, okay, I get it.
Let's get very rational stuff, people.
It's not, you know, come on.
You didn't, who's here to get Bacchic?
I came, let's stop the lesson and just get back to Bacchus.
Let's go.
Look at this people, what's he gonna give you?
He's gonna give you, look at the two words underlined.
Do you see oinu and in?
That's the word for wine and genus, oinus, right?
Oh, look at that.
And it's adjectives.
Way the heck over there.
On the other side, way over here, right here.
Eger si no oio.
And that's a fight for your great people, my students.
That's archaic, right?
That's an old genitive.
Anywho, look, they don't have to be right next to each other.
I got no problem with that.
What is this thing full of, right?
It's full of this wine that is resurrection wine.
You say what?
Resurrection wine.
Have you ever heard of resurrection wine?
Interesting.
It's gonna egero you.
What does that mean?
You remember the little kid?
It was under the influence and the tomb.
Screaming out, Jesus goes into.
Rise up.
Egero.
Egero.
Egero.
That's all you need, people.
That's all you need is that resurrection wine.
Okay, the Son of God brings us that, right?
Thank you.
Thank you, nice.
Let's go to the next one.
What else do we get in this package, right?
Well, it has, if you're gonna be involved in this,
you're gonna be involved in the oistress up front.
And everybody here knows what the gadfly does.
The gadfly stings you and makes you mad.
He makes you crazy.
He makes you want to pursue.
Kicks your mind into a place of mania
that is unsatisfiable, insatiable.
Oh, God.
She's giving it to him.
Who is daughter instead of the milk?
That's what it says under it.
Let's go.
Let's go.
And what happens?
Look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
Speak up.
Speak up, old man.
Where'd you find the nectar of Olympus on earth?
Where'd you find it?
Where'd you get it?
You didn't get it from the cathesis.
This xanthochron, hudor, look at that, xanthochron.
What does that mean?
It means the color of xanthos, xanthos.
What is this stuff?
You thought, what is this stuff?
I'm going to assume it's wine.
This isn't the origin of wine making.
This is the origin of Bacchus.
Take a look at the next, next we're going to give a,
I think it's this one.
Is that, yep, xanthos people.
Now we have a problem.
Take it down.
We have a problem and then put it right back up
when I say we have a problem with colors and antiquity.
