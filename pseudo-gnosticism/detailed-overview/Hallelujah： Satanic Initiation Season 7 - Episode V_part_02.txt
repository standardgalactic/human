You would think in Greek that there would be a red and a blue,
maybe a green and a yellow.
Everything's going to be fine.
Yeah, well you discover there's a huge problem
when you start studying medicine
because every color fluid that comes out of the body
must be described.
These are all symptoms.
Yeah, was he phlegmatic?
What was it like?
Right, was he bilious?
Right, so you have to know these colors
and they're weird and they can vary.
And every time you have one, you got to think,
I bet this could be a couple other colors.
So here's our option people of the color.
Yellow, various shades with the tinge of red,
brown or auburn.
Perhaps all the way to a brown through an auburn.
Golden people, xanthos is golden.
It's like yellow with a touch of blood
with just a touch of blood.
But look, we know certain people are known
for their nice blonde hair.
Their nice blonde hair.
And there's even a wine here in this list.
Look at paragraph number two.
We got an aphrodisiac wine.
There's that golden, golden.
You want some golden stuff?
You know what Kelly's hair was colored?
It was golden.
You know what Medea's hair was colored?
It was color of radiating sun.
Nice, nice.
That's the color we've got here.
And that's the color of the hudor,
the solution that Bacchus has given people.
And let's see what it does.
Okay, so first we already got the painkillers at the door.
Right, now what are we doing?
Right now we're getting ready.
We're hearing about, people are dancing, singing,
and now we're gonna get the golden.
We're gonna get the golden.
You ready for the golden?
Watch what it does to you.
Watch what the golden does to you.
Don't tell me, right?
Don't, no regrets on this trip.
People all wanted to be here.
So no regrets for what we're about to see.
I think it was this one, Chewie.
Yeah, I just wanted to blow that up.
Look up, there it is.
Getting the golden water.
Okay, here we go.
Bring me up the next one.
Go ahead, yep.
Nope, that's not that one.
I wanna show them that when I work it out.
Look, in a fragment.
I just want you to see.
Before that, we got there.
I was about to drink it, right?
I was about to drink it.
But look, we gotta realize who's around us at the party.
Who's around us?
A crowd, an awful loss.
Just like Jesus.
You mean Jesus's kiddies followed us here?
Yes!
Jesus's children followed us to a barricade.
You can do that.
You know why?
The devil's in control.
You can summon his ghost.
You can grab that resurrected guy right out of the sky.
Bring him here right now.
Why'd you thank the two or three thing?
Two, three of you, I'll be right there with you.
You will.
There's a hundred of us.
Let's go to, look, we brought him with us, people.
What does this say?
Says this is all happening with a crowd of local nymphs.
Local nymphs, yeah, local nymphs and children.
Children, right?
Children.
Local nymphs and the children.
Do you remember the doves?
Oh wow, what is a nymph?
What is a nymph?
What is a dove?
What is a dove?
Where are the kids?
We're in a barricade.
Does anybody feel just a little uncomfortable?
No, you don't.
And do you know why you don't feel uncomfortable?
Because we have given you one drug at the entry
and now you're getting another one.
This is the main thing.
You'll need an antidote for it.
But just wait, just wait, watch what happens.
Let's see.
And I know some of you have written to me and have been,
by the way, if I haven't gone back to you,
I'm really sorry, I'm really sorry.
I will catch up.
But for any of you who have been,
people have written to me and said that they know
of these festivals, right?
What's the difference between the mystery
and just a good, solid rave?
Because watch what happens at the mystery.
It doesn't happen, it's rave.
Okay, here we go.
Oh my God.
This thing, did you get some?
Let's have some together.
That's right, let's have some, final season.
Let's have some together, have some together.
Oh, that golden stuff, that golden stuff.
That's what they're doing and what happens?
This golden stuff, I'm just gonna translate.
This isn't the potion that Lady Athena created for us.
This isn't that.
This thing is sweeter than any milk that you can get, man.
Right, it stays fresh all the time.
Do you hear me?
I just, did I just have the potion?
Yeah, and this is what I'm saying.
This stuff is crazy good.
Wow, fresh, bro.
That's what happens, fresh.
Now, look what happens.
It's also, look at the last word in the third line,
coqueo nos, coqueo nos.
Does anybody recognize the coquean?
Yes, you remember how many times I've told you
coquean is an ingredient that is used.
It's a compound, but it is an ingredient
that is used along with other.
It's mixed with other things, right?
This thing that you're getting on board,
this is the top.
This is the heart of elusis being channeled
right through a god, right into a nectar.
And we're gonna get served that nectar.
Let's go to the next one.
I love this, I love this.
Are you guys ready?
Watch what happens, watch what it does to people.
Look, you must have taken this stuff from,
didn't you take this stuff from Hebe?
She must have been the one to give it to you.
