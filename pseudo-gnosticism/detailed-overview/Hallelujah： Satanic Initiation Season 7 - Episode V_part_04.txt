the ritual is there, everything about the mystery.
By the time Jesus gets there, remember, this is hot.
This is hot 300 years before Jesus.
This is hot 250 years before Jesus
when people are writing for the first time
the Septuagint in Greek and it becomes a hit.
Yeah, yeah.
This is that stuff that's there.
Remember, it's from this environment.
That's why Moses is gonna show up.
You thought Moses was gonna show up?
Oh, we gotta keep going.
Where are the babies?
Can somebody get me the babies?
It never works unless you have a giant sacrifice.
Do you see your sacrifice?
Let's go, let's look at the child sacrifice, shall we?
Oh, no, no, let's not.
You can't look anywhere today
that you don't see the child sacrifice.
So appropriately, here it is, here it is.
Let's go to the next one.
Yep.
Yeah, okay, so here, I'm just gonna translate.
Look, I'm really small,
but I'm just gonna try to blow it up to you.
It's okay, I don't mind.
Oh, it's hurting me.
Okay, look, what happens?
Dionysus is pissed off.
Yeah, what does he do?
He drives all the Anarchy and women.
Oystress mad.
Look at the second line, oistresa.
He oystressizes them, yeah.
And what do they start doing?
They start a la lazoing.
What do you do when you a la lazo?
It's a war cry.
It's also a shout of joy,
and it's particular to the Bacchic Mysteries.
It is our word, take it down, for hallelujah.
For hallelujah, just take it down for a minute.
Hallelujah.
When you wanna express hallelujah,
you're expressing an old Greek idea.
An old Greek idea that was there centuries
before there was ever any Hebrew.
Okay, our understanding of these documents
has been completely tainted
by religious schools, both Jewish and Christian.
Both of these groups, this Jewish religion
and this Christian religion,
both of these monotheistic religions
developed from the Bacchic ritual.
I'm not the one to first start saying that.
They said that in antiquity
when they were watching what they did.
Yeah, fantastic.
Okay, let's go to the next source.
What are those people doing?
That looks illegal.
Go to the next one.
Okay, no, I mean, go to the old one.
Okay, yeah, there we are.
Okay, now what happened?
He drives them mad.
He's pissed off, right?
Bacchus is mad.
Because they, why?
Because they won't accept his worship.
So he makes them accept his worship.
You see, that's not a very nice thing for the son of God.
This son of God,
isn't like the son of God that you're used to, right?
This son of God has something to prove.
And he does so.
Watch this, what does he do?
The women, he makes it so they go out on the highways
and they find people and hurt them.
And these poor women, they take,
I'm just gonna translate it for you.
They ready their cutting implements for their newborns.
They ready cutting implements for their newborns.
And they take the sword, what is this, what happens?
A mother will kill her kid right there.
Yeah, another one will take her kid
who is only three years old and totally destroy him.
And another one, some other one,
will take their little kid and throw him up in the air.
Just heave him, heave him under the influence,
under the influence.
They won't have any thoughts.
You know where their minds are?
It says their minds are in a place.
They won't have any thoughts for breastfeeding, right?
They won't have any thoughts for that.
They won't remember the childbirth.
They won't remember they'll just sacrifice.
So a mother killed her son, yeah,
doesn't even think about the breast,
has no memory of giving that kid birth.
You know what happens in the place called a sterion?
It says this, you know what happens?
Their young people give a sacrifice
of the locks of their hair.
You know what sacrifice they're given now?
They're given the children's sacrifice.
Yeah, I'll tell you what I'm doing.
Uh-oh, all the air went out of the room, right?
Can you feel it?
It's kind of chilly, right?
You thought you wanted to come to this.
I told you, I'll bring it to you.
I'll show you what it is.
I'll show you, and now you're sad.
Don't worry, there's a bottom and there's a top.
We'll come back, we'll come back here.
Let's start to come back.
We've gotten to the bottom.
Okay, are you ready?
Shift into, oh, bring in Jesus.
Where's Jesus?
Come here, Jesus, Revelation, Revelation 21.
And I saw a new Uranos and a new Gaia
for the first Uranos and the first Gaia.
It perished, it went away.
And the sea is not, yeah, yeah.
And what else did he see?
He saw holy Jerusalem.
I'm telling you what I'm seeing, baby.
I see that new Jerusalem coming down,
coming down from Uranos and from Theos.
I see it coming, yeah.
And what's gonna happen?
It's gonna be like a nymph.
It's gonna be like a nymph.
Wait, take it down.
A nymph, did we just see them?
We saw them, right, with the kids.
You saw them, Chewy.
Did you see the nymphs that were here?
I told you, right?
We're gonna see a nymph.
Wait a minute, is this the Bible talking about Jesus,
the Son of God performing the mystery?
Correct, it is.
It is.
It's him doing it.
And he's got the nymph.
Have you ever wondered, let me just ask you Christians,
Catholic, Protestant, doesn't matter.
I'll even ask the Mormons.
Maybe the Mormons go for this stuff.
Did you hold his witnesses?
I don't care.
All you guys, all you guys know that when Jesus comes back,
