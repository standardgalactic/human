through his mom, Kermintah.
Love it.
You know, she was a prophet, right?
You know, she was a Bacchic prophet.
Is that surprise anyone?
Yeah.
Love it.
Did you know your history has been generated
by people you are unfamiliar with?
Yeah.
Yeah, it has.
Very good.
Very good.
It's only the dogs that get recognized, right?
Given to your fear of Christ, right?
Become that fear of pan.
Keep going.
Yeah.
And the women.
Women, by the way, this is just a little bit.
I'm just, I'm taking Paul and I'm just causing him
to cough up something.
We're talking about marriage and whatnot and cult.
And you know, what?
If you are within the movement, what is your opinion?
Right?
You gotta obey your men, you know,
as if they were the Curios.
Do you hear me, Eve?
Do you hear me out there?
Why is this associate?
Do you hear me?
Eve didn't listen.
That's what started the whole problem.
They had just written this thing in the third century.
So these New Testament writers, they're fresh on it, right?
It's hand in glove.
It's good stuff.
And you have to understand that that Curios,
that Christos is that Adam.
And I'm not the one saying this.
They're the ones saying this.
Is the Adam.
You mean Judaism and Christianity
are just two aspects of one single cult?
Yes.
And that cult came earlier
and gave birth to Judaism and Christianity
at a time when women were also worshiped.
Love it, love it.
You're never gonna be able to hide those women.
Keep going.
Yeah, next quote, please.
This is Ephesians and Paul says in the men,
love your wives, you know, is Christ.
Is he agape the ecclesia, the church, right?
Okay, all right, all right, good, good.
Gave himself, you know, gave himself,
put his all and might into it.
You know what I mean for the church?
Because this is his bride.
Come on, man, we defend him.
We defend the bride.
That's the way it is.
Do you think this mystery didn't defend the bride?
Look, and what is all this for?
It is for catharsis.
It is for a cathartic cleansing.
Wait, what, am I back in the Bacchic, right?
Yeah, you are.
This is Christianity, but it's Bacchic.
And what is all this for?
What does Ephesians say?
Right, why does Jesus do all of this?
In order that he may purify her, right?
He may make her holy with a purification.
It's a bath.
It's a bath of water.
And how do we get there?
We get there in remati, rema, rema, that's what we'll teach you.
That's what we'll teach you in the initiation
when we get there.
And we are ready to bring you there and back.
That's what we'll use, the rema.
This is what we see in the papyri,
the Greek magical papyri.
This is what we see.
The use of this rema, this saying,
it's not really the same.
It's this power that radiates,
that you use via the logos,
which was in the beginning.
All right?
You see?
You have to channel the right, channel the right forces.
Or you're not gonna be commanding demons.
It gets my goat when people try to command demons
without understanding the physics
because the physics is image.
And if you don't have the right image,
it's gonna be useless.
I don't know why.
I mean, it's like, if you don't have wings,
you're not gonna fly, bro.
It's that simple.
Let's go back to the source.
Okay, good.
And so this is that cleansing that we need.
We are in cathartic rites with Jesus.
And Bacchus.
Go back.
Yep.
Fantastic.
Yeah.
Why is he, what's he gonna do?
Ultimately, he's gonna make his bride a thing of honor.
Right?
Not having any spelone or rutida.
Wait, she's gotta, she's gotta,
she's got no spelone and no rutida.
Did Eve have this stuff?
Did Eve have this?
No, she didn't, right?
Because Jesus and Jehovah don't pick anything
but perfect virgins, right?
Are you, come on, people, watch.
Look what happens.
But she is a momos, Eve is a momos at the bottom.
She is not without blame.
A momos.
The church has to be made without blame.
Why does Eve have the blame?
Cause she went through it and had her eyes opened
and saw that God was nobody.
Yeah.
Isn't that amazing?
It brought her, you thank the guard of Eden
the expulsion of Eve and her forced hard labor
in childbirth because he took away all her drugs.
You really thank that Eve went down
and got on her knees and honored this Creighton
who threw her out.
Sorry, apologies to the people of Creighton.
It's Menander.
And back to Medea.
She's the one who said Creighton's are all liars, right?
Sorry, it's a modern Creighton.
Lovely place, gorgeous place.
Anywho, this is what we have to.
This is what we have to deal with.
Eve's reputation.
She didn't lose it.
She gained it.
What did God, Jove or Jehovah?
What did that father God know?
He knew that if she got access to this fruit
from her own tree that she would be like him.
