The ramp up is a God is frigging angry, God's going to destroy you
What have you done? Where are all those harlots?
God's going to kill you all
That's what this is about a city called Nineveh
And who was in Nineveh? Lady Babylon was in Nineveh
And I'm going to show you the text and the text is going to tell you
And I promise you this tonight, if you'll hang in with me
The text is going to speak my name
And the text is going to show you the future
Are you ready? You're going to love this, you're going to love this, it's delicious
Who were they? Were they invited? That's fantastic
Hello guys, have a seat. Did they drink it yet?
Alright, let's see, it's taking longer than usual, Chewie
What's going on? Make sure you've got enough in the mixture
There are indications that an acros- oh watch this, watch what happens
There are indications that an acrostic underlines the present text
Thus one-two begins with the first letter of the alphabet
The Hebrew alphabet, they're talking about the Hebrew traditions
That built later on top of the Greek
So the people who were translating the original Septuagint
Those people were creating a form of Hebrew
That ends up, they try to do cutesy stuff like
Weave in acrostics, alphabeta, gamma, delta
Right? Oh, I'm sorry
I'm in alphabet, gimble, dalit
Why do they have the same mommy?
Why do they have the same? Do you know why, Timmy?
The Greek is ages older
Ages, ages
And the Greek is flourishing all over the Mediterranean
All over and those people there, they're speaking Greek
And there's a movement of them, a group of monists
Because I want you to realize something as we work through this
I want you to realize there was no Hebrew circulating
There was a group of monists who were of the Jewish ethnicity
And these monists, just like the evangelicals today
I've got lots of friends in Israel who would tell you to your face
You can take that religion and shove it
Right? They don't care about that
They care about the democracy
And I'll bet they're upset
I'll bet they're thinking they could make their voices heard
I bet they are
These are the people
These are the people
It's the classical spring that we have to go back to
And in order to do that, I've got to take you to some dark places
Here's another one
What was there? Anything there?
Here, what is this?
This is the prophet speaking
After God said he's going to crush everyone
He's going to even destroy their city
Take it off its foundations
Right?
And he's going to say like the Smeelachs
Right? Like the Smeelachs
When it is put into the form of a crown
It gets all dry and brittle
A calamity of grass blows away
That's what he's going to do
That's what he's going to do to these people
Especially these people in Nineveh
Right? Give me the next one
That's where we are as Nineveh
Nineveh and people will say, wait a minute
Are we in Bible times? No, we're in history
I just want you to see that I'm not making this up
The enemy shall be laid bare
Even to the foundation and shall be devoured
As twisted you and as stubble, fully dry
Do you know what that you is, that Smeelachs?
That is the botanical that is used in those crowns
As we celebrate the dead
The dead
Okay, all right, give me the next one
I need the next one, I'm not sure
Okay, look at the new international version
Now this is going to be based on the Hebrew
They will be entangled among thorns and drunk
From what?
And drunk
There's no drunkenness in there
This is the Smeelachs
There's no drunkenness in there
This is my example
I think three examples of how bad Hebrew was used
To distort the original Greek meaning
And this is one of them
This is what I call invention
Something has to be thrown in
Because they didn't like what was being said
And boom, right?
It was either because they didn't like it
Which I think is why they're dropping a lot of the Christs
From the Hebrew
The Hebrew will drop it out, right?
By the way, a little tidbit of an announcement of beauty
There is no word Messiah
I'm not kidding you
I'm not kidding you
When you're talking about that in the Septuagint
It's the Christ
It's never
And that's why the governor asked him
You know what I mean?
Who's truth, baby?
Who's truth?
Give me the next one
Quick, while they're down
Watch this
I just wanted you to see
You can talk about food
To be eaten
Let's get back up again
Fatima Khan
Look at that, Fatima Khan
As opposed to Potom
I just wanted you to see
The things that we can eat
Are drugs
Drugs
Give me the next one
Here it comes
I'm not sure
I'm going fast
Here's another common error
Going from the Greek to the Hebrew
As you browse
Looking at what the Hebrew did to the Greek
You'll find it will drop concepts
Like logezmos, right?
It'll drop polyslabic, complex concepts
It'll drop them off completely
Go to the next one
And what else?
I wanted you to see here
Look at the reasoning here
Counting or calculation, okay?
An account or a reckoning
A holding of an audit, okay?
Without reference to number
It's reasoning, an argument
Or reasoning power
So that is your power of calculating
Your power of discernment
Via reason
Love it, love it
Logos, right?
Okay, so this concept
