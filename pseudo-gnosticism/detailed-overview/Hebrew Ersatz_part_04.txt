Oh, this is from the library
Included colloquial compositions
In the form of legislation
This is what you get with the language
Legislation, right?
We're not talking about modern advanced legislation either
We're talking about deals for building irrigation systems
And stuff like that
It's not that interesting
Foreign correspondences
Engagements, aristocratic declarations
And financial matters
It's from this that people think
Most of society wasn't literate
You can say that about this
I know I have looked at the linear B
That is the Mycenaean Greek
And when it says that there's medicine there
Because they're talking about lists of ingredients
That they're shipping places
And you'll notice the language at that time is stuck
It is stuck in this form
This non-alphabetic form
The greatest achievement
Was bringing the instrument
Whereby Greek could fully express herself
That was the achievement
That was the achievement
Let's go
Wait, let's keep reading
The remaining text contains divinations, elements, incantations, hymns
While others are concerned with medicine, astronomy
That is, they'll mention an ingredient
Don't get me wrong, these are not treatises on medicine
For all these texts in the library
Only 10
Listen to this
Only 10 contain expressive, rhythmic, literary works
Such as epics and myths
And they're calling those things epics
Epic or Gilgamesh, right?
God, seriously?
Look at the buildings, people
Look at the buildings, right?
And that's like frigging reconstructed, right?
Right?
Okay, give me the next one
Show me some more of the site
What does it look like? Yeah
Yeah, there we go
Hmm, what happened?
What happened?
What, is it the materials you're using?
Right, no, give them the picture of what they're competing with
Give them the picture of what they're...
Oh, here's the stone too, everybody says
Ooh, look at this, oh
Ooh, the relief
Yeah, okay
Okay, it's like that Egyptian garbage
And you know what, I don't work right now
In a situation where I have to worry
Any professor, get it straight, people
Any professor at a university right now
Would never say this
But they all know it
And it's kind of strange
It's kind of strange
You know what allowed art
To become so beautiful under the Greeks?
It was the language
It turns out the secrets in the language
Computing language, give me the next one
What are they competing against people?
You know what those mud hills were competing against?
They're competing against this
Right, and anytime you look at Nineveh
You're gonna see an artist reconstruction
Don't get excited
They always blow it way out of proportion
Like the movies, they always blow it way out of scale-wise
No, sorry
Just, you know, what they had construction-wise to work with
Look at what they're competing with
You can't compete with Athens
You can't compete with Athens
And you say, oh, that's stuff
That's gotta be newer stuff
No, no, no, it's not like they develop better technology
The cult on that Acropolis is old
Is old, look what they managed to do
Look what they managed to do
You know how you get to this point
Where your stone pillars
Your columns are women
Look at that
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that the most gorgeous thing that you've seen?
You know how much weight must be on that neck?
Do you think the Greeks sat around and said, you know what?
Let's put some sheep on it, let's put some people
And just carve them in
No, dude, there has to be engineering here
There's incredible engineering
Give me another one, give me another one
Look at this sculpture
Look at it
Dude, everybody has the right number of legs and arms
Yup, yup, what are you looking at?
You're looking at the progression of a language
You're looking at the progression of a language
Give me this one
Give me this one, right?
Now this statue was melted down
Because of what it was made of
It was made of gold and ivory
The statue of Athena that was there
The statue of Athena
This society that is polytheistic
And is using the Greek language
Achieves its engineering feats
Through its language
A lot of people say
And again, I'm going to say something nobody would say from university
Oh, pyramids
So, what have you got?
You've got a bunch of big blocks piled on top of each other
And what is your literature?
Oh, I'm sorry, you don't have any
You've got the Book of the Dead?
Have you read the Book of the Dead?
It's written not by a third grader, but by a second grader
Oh, Egyptianness and Egyptianness
They've got stone friggin' blocks
Big deal, they figured out how to squash enough slaves
To get those blocks on top of each other
Ooh, mystery, UFOs, bullshit
Look at a Greek temple
Did we have one more of a Greek temple?
Do you have any in there?
Did you know people, you need to appreciate this for a minute
You need to appreciate this
If you can find a temple, bring us a temple tree
Those columns
Those columns that are, you know, make up the Greek temples
You know, from a distance
When you're miles away from the temple
And you can see the thing for miles
They're built that way, right?
And you can say the same thing
