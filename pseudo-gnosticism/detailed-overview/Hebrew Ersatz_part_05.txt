You can say the same thing, that's okay, that has columns
The same thing for the pyramid, right?
But the pyramids, the pyramids are just blocks
That column has to fight an optical illusion
Because when you get a certain distance from it
It will bend in the middle
It's an optical illusion
And your temple at a certain distance will look like
What's wrong, it's a little bendy
It's very not nice to look at
Did you know the Greeks calculated how to compensate for that
So that all the way out, you could look at it
And those columns look straight
They straightened them
And how did they do that?
It was just a little bulge
It was just a little bulge
Yeah, oh God
The engineering, the engineering
Okay, let's give it, where's Lady Babylon?
I'm getting ready, I'm getting ready
Here it's coming, Pavel
I'm going to give you a surprise
What was that for? Redemption
This is how they replaced hubris
Can you believe this?
Anybody who knows Greek knows that hubris is an assault baby
It's an assault
It's, oh, I can't say the R word
Get me off of here
Banana-ing, right?
Redemption, who chose that?
And what Greek slipped and went from redemption to assault?
Bad, bad form, right? Bad form
Give me the next one
Of course the Hebrew couldn't, yeah, here it is
Of course the Hebrew couldn't have a concept like hubris
It's too complex for one word
The level of their constructions are all at the level of basic vocabulary
That you need to go to kindergarten
And come home and not forget your lunch money
And you know what I mean?
It's just the basics
It's taking care of sheep
And, you know, on a very rudimentary level
And we're going to do this
Breathe these with these
We're going to get these, woo!
Right?
That's why God, who gets sick of how dumb the language is
Says in the prophet
I'm not going to send you to somebody who speaks in a complex language
I'm going to send you to the house of Israel
Right?
It was a very simple language
That ultimately got squashed
And then a group of its people
Right? Remember, people had migrated from Crete to the Levant
And those people who were involved in those migrations
Are bringing that culture with them
And all of the artifacts with it
They're bringing so much of it with them
That you can't even find the coins that don't have Athena on them
Everybody's like in Israel is like, oh, there's another Athena coin
Right?
Why? Because that was the level
Did you see Athens?
Did you see Athens?
Where do you think you want to live in antiquity?
Where do you think everybody wants to be in antiquity?
Even the Romans who were so proud of their beautiful city
Which it was beautiful
Beautifully engineered, too
Beautifully
Right?
What do you think they wanted to do?
They wanted to go to Athens, baby
Why? It's the place
It's the mind
It's the mind, man
It's good for you
Go there
Get in one of the festivals
Go through the initiation
Right? You'd be a better person
Polytheism was the way
It was when the monists took over in Judaism
Right?
That they created this tradition of these prophets
Like the one we're looking at tonight
They invented these people
They invented them
There's no other trace of them anywhere
I tell it to people like this
I tell it to people like this, look
There is no ancient Hebrew literature
Outside of what you call the Torah
Or what you call the Old Testament prophets
The Law and the Prophets
There is no Hebrew anywhere
They didn't write anything
You mean their entire civilization never figured out
Had a right, I don't know
Maybe a suicide note
They didn't write anything?
No, they didn't
They didn't
Hebrew was not only defunct by the first century
When Jesus is around
But it's been that way for centuries
It was a small, probably a small tribal language
We don't even have evidence for this
And every time they uncover something
It's got a scratch on it
Oh, it must be Hebrew
No, people
It's desperation
You don't have to do that to fulfill the monist agenda
You don't have to do that
Right? You have your own history
You have your own history
You don't have to replicate
What the monists would have you do
Because they always throw down democracy
They always overthrow democracy
It's the one thing monism is outstanding at doing
Okay, let's not say too much
Because we don't want to spoil what happens
Give me the next one
Okay, people, I want to give you a couple more names
And he says, oh, you city of blood
You bunch of liars, you're full of injustice
You're not going to what?
You're not going to undertake those hunts
You're not going to be involved in that bestiary
Give me the next one
There was no limit in the people
You know what there is wrong with Nineveh?
You know what they're doing in Nineveh?
And they're mud-frigging huts
There's no limit
This says
There's no limit to their...
Too much porneia
And it's affecting their bodies, baby
It's weakening them
Too much porneia
What's going on in Nineveh?
There's too much porneia
Next one
