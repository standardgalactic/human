Give me the next one
Quick, guess who shows up
To rescue Nineveh
Guess who shows up
Surprise
Surprise, measure things out
Tune up your cords
Apportion the lots
Amen
Yeah
Yeah
You know who she is
By the way, you see the third line down
I'm translating, Amen
Can you see it?
It's the first word
It's the first word
Fantastic
Amen, what are you going to do?
She's coming
What does she do?
She lives in those waters
Those waters
She's that queen of that phallus
She builds those walls
Of water Egypt
And Ethiopia
Her glory
And there's no limits
To her transit
Those Libyan women
Or her assistants
You know who we're talking about here?
We're talking about Lady Babylon
Who was the medwa
We're talking about
Medea, historically
Medea
She
Is the author and originator
Of your mystery
Yeah
Judaism, Christianity
All of it
All of it
It was an attempt
To take the cult
To take the health
And the activity of the drugs
They were using
It was all an attempt to take that
And control it
To control it
One cult
Ruling them all
Made by one woman
And who
Brings that woman
Amen
Fantastic
Give me the next one
I told you the text says
There
There
Can you see that?
Ethiopia and Egypt, don't you love that?
Why? She was traveling all throughout the region
People in Italy know her too
Right?
The entire group changes their ethnicity
You say, oh it came from Persia
Persia, my anus
Nothing came out of there
Greek
Swallowed them too
Fantastic
Love it
And then he says you're drunk
I'm not drunk, what the hell are you talking about?
Yahoo
And your people, what does Yahoo say?
Your people are like women
Do you know how big
The brain of Yahoo really is?
It's the
Equivalent of the third grader

And I know there's a ton of women
Particularly out there who are like
Oh look, one of the stupid men
Finally caught on

Give me the next one
There's a finger print
I just wanted you to see
This is the word bukos
Which is the word for locust
The wingless larva
Of the locust
Okay, great
No problem
Where is this particular word coming from?
It's showing up in the Septuagint
And it's showing up where else
In Cypriot
In Cypriot
So there's an influence from Cyprus
Okay
That text that is the toro
Or the Old Testament
That text was not written
By people that you
Think wrote it
It wasn't
And they didn't live when you think
They lived
History we have
That says they lived back then
Is from the theologians
Who have to say they lived back then
Or that document is not history
And it's not
It's not
There's no other proof
If it were, there would be evidence
There would be quotes
Things that have the Egyptians would have made a giant
Skip you to the
Skip you to the
Moses followers
You know what I mean?
They had their art
Don't get me wrong, I've been to Egypt
I've been to the pyramids
It was gorgeous
I've been down the Nile on a train
And I've been to the
I've been to the Karnak
And all that kind of stuff like that
Don't get me wrong
It's impressive stuff, but baby
Baby
The sophistication
