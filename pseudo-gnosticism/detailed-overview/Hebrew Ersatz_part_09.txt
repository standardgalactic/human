The art
It's got to come from the language
It's got to come from the language
Yeah
Not all languages are created equal
They're not
Mother Greek, we love you
I appreciate you coming tonight
I want everybody to know
Everybody to know
I know I skipped Dom and used
Presentation and material
I'm sorry
I'm going to be lagging a little bit
And I know people are sending me applications
I still have a giant list of people
To try to shove into classes
I'm still trying to do that
So
Stay tuned
I'm going to pack those classes
The best I can
Not until it's uncomfortable
Eight or nine students
Then it starts getting uncomfortable
I know
And I'm getting your email
I know people are like, I don't know
I didn't hear anything
And it's, you know, don't worry
It'll come
Keep reading your text
Please
Your intensive text
And I will get with each of you
I promise you
We just need a little bit of time
And a little bit of patience
Thank you for me
The Aussie group is coming together
I'm going to send out their
Acceptance this weekend
And that'll be class
So
Thank you for everybody who is
Working hard
There's a great new
Video that came out
By
What was his name?
He was a bald guy
A bald guy with tattoos
You're going to love it
Can you post that?
Chewy, thanks
A bald guy with tattoos
He's better looking than me though
So he's
He did a show
And he also happens to turn out he's a
Linguist, you know what I mean
And so
He says, you know, hey
I want you to hear it because
I don't want you to hear it from my mouth
I want you to hear it from somebody else
Who's
Makes me not look crazy
But makes the
Image that you get
Through the theology
And he's exactly right
And the actual history
Is always way more interesting
So kudos
I'll get his name and I'll throw it out there
He was doing
He does a lot of stuff
Got a ton of videos, he's got like thousands of videos
Hey, old boy
No, it's not old boy
Right, no, but hey
So I'll get him posted
See if he can get his name real quick
Can you get his name?
No, we shouldn't, we should have prepped that
Clip
Okay, on the community tab
Chewie says we'll get that on the community tab
So keep an eye out for that because it's a great
Interview of somebody who actually
Does languages and not just
So that he can have a job
At a university and appear
To do languages, right, real
You know, decent, I like that
I have kudos, kudos to people
Thank you
Satanic congregation for coming
Tonight, I think that
Our progression
To the reality
Is, I think
We're getting there and I'm
Going to keep bringing it and I'm just
Going to new, I promise
People new stuff, a couple of people said
Hey, he already mentioned that before
Okay
Okay, we're always going to drag
Along Jesus and the naked kid
Right, that he was arrested with
We're always going to bring that along
Right, you're always going to be
Looking at the right
With that in the back of your mind
But what you need is the new stuff
And there's so much out there
There's so much creepiness
And I'll dig deep for you
We're going to go creepy
Thank you for hanging in and
Hail Satan
We're breaking stars
Find the rain rhymes
But you won't hold the flame
A pena in the sky
Diamond sharp
On a magic cover
A fly, the man who laughs
Will mess
Day to wake up
Make these bitches jump
Posse out on Broadway
Dr. Doom
Face gone blue
She moved on up
If you forget the face
Magic is the best thing
Wish you could have
She moved on up
If you forget the face
Magic is the best thing
Wish you could have
Jesus Creepers
