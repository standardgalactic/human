Omnia is silenced
They sell you knock off Jesus
Vaccineally is a real mystery
Your poster boy pedophile drug addict was made by Rome
To enslave all of you
Knock knock, can't you hear me? I'm at the door
Pristine Theory X
Black Waters, Black Bentham
Julius Caesar
Hung Medea's portrait
On the Temple of Venus
Divine Julian Library of the Renaissance
Sibylene Brooks, so cold with the breezy poisonous kisses
She sells seashells and by the seashells
Medea
She sells seashells and by the seashells

Welcome back to Lady Babylon
And what I predict will be the most feather-ruffling show we've ever had tonight
So buckle up, Satanic congregation
I thank you for coming
I thank you for coming
I want to make a couple of announcements
Before we begin, thank you, Teddy Bates
I want to make a couple of announcements
I'm getting a lot of requests
And thank you for those
Love it, love it
People are saying
Where is Amen you?
Amen you is coming
Amen you is coming
I have to push first to get you
Amen you
And we'll go from there
Soldiers
You'll notice the tone is changing
A little bit at Amen you
And you'll notice that
Well the instruction is rather
Drill-ish
Yes, oh God
Because we need everybody on their toes
With the Greeks so that we can
Access the library
Right, we are at that
Renaissance
That seed is just about to sprout
Just about to sprout
For all you people in future studies
Oh God, this was the year
Oh I love it
So more to come
It's coming and it will come
And everybody can be involved
In that who wants to be
And it'll be fantastic
The museum
The integrity of the museum
Must be held
As our
Distinct privilege
I want to say a thank you
To all of the people
From discordia
Who have been working
So hard
And the talent by the way
You know I know not everybody
Was privileged to be there
But this was a show
That was playing out in front of me
That was just gorgeous
Full of integrity
Hopping with artistic beauty
The music was gorgeous
This is people composing
Performing music
The poetry was exquisite
This is stuff written
This is salon
You're creating an environment
And you did
So tonight
After Lady Babylon
I will meet
With the round table
And I will give you
The words of Omnia
Fantastic
Fantastic I'm looking forward to that
So right afterwards
On tonight's show
We're gonna have
Gnostic Informant come
Gnostic Informant's gonna come
And inform us
Fantastically
So wait for it
When I'm done with my section
I'm gonna call him in
Love it, love it
Everybody who's been involved
Will thank you
Thank you
So I promise you
Because I know you're
Satanic congregation
I know what you're looking for
This is the dirty stuff you want
This is the stuff
That will cause controversy
This is the edge
They called it
The last wild frontier of classics
Who said that?
The London Times
This is the edge
Tonight I am going
To bring to you
The big lie
Yeah, this is it
This is bigger than big
This is the one
That changed history
Without it
The timeline degenerates
We fall back to that classical well
We wake up and we see
We see indeed the best thing
To do is to serve the muse
Tonight I'm going to show you
I'm gonna do something very
Straightforward and simple
I know everybody has time constraints
So here's what I'm gonna do
I'm gonna value your time
And I'm gonna say
We're going to look at
Isaiah chapter three
Isaiah chapter three
But we're gonna look at it
In the way that you've never looked at it before
We're gonna look at it
In the original language
In which it was written
Which is Greek
And you're going to see
How the translation slope
From higher tech
To lower tech
Is downward plummet
You're gonna see it
Oh God, what are we gonna do?
I'm gonna show you those texts
For the first time
Are you ready for this?
And I want you to see
How the big lie changed history
And you happen to be swimming in it
Right now
You're swimming in it
Is everybody on the throne?
I forgot to tell us
Get out now, everybody
We gotta get out
This ship is landed
We're going into the zone
But on tonight's mission
I want you to taste the big lie
Here we go
Are you ready?
Get me up the first
This is who we're looking at
Hesaias
Oh, you say it so strangely
Hesaias
Oh, love it
This is Isaiah
Isaiah
And Isaiah is going to
Prophecy for us
He's gonna tell us
Like prophets do
He's gonna tell us about
Yahoo
And about what Yahoo's gonna do
To these people
Who are dancing with their
Wait a minute, what?
Okay, hang on, right?
We always go to cult sites, right?
You didn't think I wouldn't bring you to
A place that wasn't cult
Because I know what you love, baby
I know what you love
You love these dingy cult drug parties
Yeah, it's fantastic
Don't get me wrong
We hang out together
And I appreciate that
I appreciate that
Let's go to the next one
Bring that up
What am I doing?
I'm showing you Isaiah 3
I'm first gonna show you
In the native Greek
And we're gonna look at technical terms
Look at this
Pay attention
Says the Lord Despot
Who rules Saba
He's gonna take away
From those Judeans
And from those Jerusalemites
Every strong man
And every strong woman
Is gonna take the strength
Of your bread and water
Okay, now, that was the translation, right?
Applause, Chewie
We need some kind of applause
No, yeah, not really
What does, pray tell
What does the Hebrew make of this
Because what you're looking at
What I'm gonna show you
Is the Hebrew translation
Of that Greek text
Now, that gets us into a little background
You can brainwash them with pictures now
That gets us into a little necessary background
There's a letter
And this letter is a forgery
But the letter states
That the people
Who wrote the
Septuagint
That was a group of rabbis
72 of them, I've got 72 slides tonight
72 of them, and they got together
And by the power of Yahu
They all came up with the same translation
Wonderful, just a beautiful, beautiful fairy tale
But that fairy tale was meant
For a reason
What I'm gonna show you now
Is the translation of that
Into Hebrew, which remember
This is the third century
Okay, third century
Hebrew's been dead
As dead as dead can get
I want to ask you
Before we begin this
Before I show you the Hebrew
Now, I want to ask you
Give me the name
Of one Hebrew author
Outside of the Septuagint
In Greek
The TLG will tell you
We've got a good standard, 4000-ish
Okay
If you were to take all the names
Of all the authors that are quoted
From the ancient text that we've got
You've got thousands upon thousands
Give me the name
Of one Hebrew author
Outside of the Old Testament
Give me one name
Surely they have medical writers
Everybody's got medical writers
Even the Egyptians
Have medical writers
And you say
Oh, well, the Egyptians were
Hu-ha-boo-ha
This is literature
We're talking about writing
This is evidence
We're not here for ideas
We're here for evidence
Yes, okay
So, let's see what happens
When you take that
And now you're trying to forge
Tonight's show is all about forgery
And fraudulence
If you were fraudulent
You'll be found out
Tonight on The Big Lie
Oh, I love it
It sounds like a detective show or something
I love that
Who is that, Chewie?
Is that a saint?
Is that a saint?
Oh, it's Isaiah
There he is
Thank you
He's got a nice desk
I like that
Nice job, Isaiah
Okay, let's keep going
Give me the next one
Because it's the Hebrew now
That we're going to jump to
