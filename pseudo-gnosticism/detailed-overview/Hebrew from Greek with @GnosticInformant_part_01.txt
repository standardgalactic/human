Go, hit it
Oh, first the new international version
See now the Lord
The Lord Almighty is about to take
From Jerusalem and Judah
Both supply and support
All supplies of food
And all supplies of water
Okay, terribly off
From the Greek
What happened to the strong man
And the strong woman?
Because ladies
You're going to love it
It's all full of women tonight
Remember, Yahoo!
Loves child sacrifice
And hates women
Right?
This is blatant, bold
Misogyny
You know why he hated them here
And Isaiah?
Because they were ruling
They were argumentists
Are you kidding?
They're rulers?
Take them out
Yes, yes
That you have to remember
Don't forget Yahoo
And I'm going to show you the name Yahoo
And why I say Yahoo
Hit it, where's Isaiah?
Get that
Get the thing on here
Oh, Prophet's buttocks
That's what we have
A Prophet's buttocks
Love it
Okay, go to the next one
What is that new international version
Based on?
All the English is going to be
Based on the Masoretic
Hebrew fiction
Of the 9th and 10th centuries
Okay, that's what it is
Remember the Dead Sea Scrolls
Everybody thanks the Dead Sea Scrolls
Were like, you know, Hebrew originals
Now, why do you think they found them with Greek?
Because the Greek texts have been long established
Yes, it's the sad fact of one laying
Which dying when another comes in
And totally takes it out
Yes, oh, it was a slaughter
My God, what Greek did
And to how many languages did Greek do it?
Oh, God
People think Alexander the Great
Spread Hellenism
I got news for you
He spread the language
And the language consumed
Consumed it, set the people on fire
Right?
Love it
Love the language, go to it
Go to it, yep
Here's the Hebrew now
Okay, here's the Hebrew
Blow it up for me, Chew
I gotta get my glasses
So here's that same verse, you know
Who's the Lord we're talking about here?
Yahweh, see Yahweh there?
That's Kourios, right?
People love to translate that
It's Yahweh
Some of the things that you see
Like they'll use one word in Greek
To translate two different Hebrew words
Right?
So get ready for the vocabulary skill
To drop through the floor
Are you ready?
Yeah, so behold the Lord Yahweh
The Lord of hosts
Takes that Sabbath, right?
Takes away from Jerusalem and from Jordan
What is this?
The stock in the store
What happened to my dude and my dudeette?
What happened to them?
They got rid of them
They got rid of them
That's interesting
What happened?
Let's keep going
See if this mystery will pull itself together
Give me the Hebrew term
What is the Hebrew term we're concerned about?
Mission, a support or staff
That has nothing to do with a person
Whoever was translating this from the Greek
Had to rely upon much more simpler expressions
Why?
Because at the time Greek was liturgical
I mean Hebrew was liturgical
There's nothing they could do
There's Greek all over the walls of your synagogues
Right?
So this is a Hebrew problem
Not a cultural or historical problem
The Hebrew language was inadequate
It was inadequate
So I'm going to show you technically
How a language that has less technical terminology
And is functioning at a lower level
Can't bear the signal of that high tech
And we're going to prove that tonight with a purple
Oh, I love it
Love this stuff
Okay, let's go
Thank you people for coming
Thank you, Gnostic
I will be there
Go to the next one
And look, this is verse two
What else is the...
Is Yahu going to take from everybody?
Look at verse two
He's going to take the giants
And he's going to take the strong
And the person who is the war trained
And the diecast
He's going to take what?
The diecast
I'll tell you, hang on to that thought
What else is he going to take?
He's going to take the prophet
The prophet
Wait, what's a prophet?
Let's see
Then he's going to take the stochastain
And the old person
The elder, you could say
He's going to take all that stuff away
Because those are the resources of those communities
Now, let's see what the Hebrew text does with this
Let's see
I think I got a picture of you, Chewie
What the Hebrew text does
Yeah, there we go
Oh, here we go
The mighty man and the man of war
Right?
So I just got to warn you
The Greek here used a very specific adjective
Indicating a type of person
Who has been trained in the arts of war
The Hebrew has to use much more simpler
Man of war
Right?
Do you hear how the level of specificity drops?
Yes, okay, keep going
They got the elder right
Wait, what else did they put there?
I forgot to...
Oh, they say the judge and the prophet
And the diviner and the elder
Right, they got the elder in there
Let's see about the others
Let's bring me up
Let's see how close they hit
Roger that
Let me see how close they got
Here's the man of war
Right?
That ish of war
Right?
Ish and Isha, right?
Look at the simplicity of the expression
Hit me the next one
What is that in the Greek original?
Yeah, it's specifically somebody trained
In the arts of war
It is a technical station or post
Give me the next one
Yeah, you can come back to that
Go ahead
Yeah
Boom
What is the war?
Is it anything specific?
Or is it just kind of just...
No, it's just battle of war, right?
Mahama
Okay, go to the next one
Cool
All right, I'm feeling it
What is it?
What is that?
That's a judge
So, on the Hebrew side, they got the judge part
But I want you to look at this word
How much more specific
We've got to go
Look, in Athens
Just notice where we are
It's a linguist
Notice where we are
In Athens, it means a juror
Okay
Can it mean a judge?
Yes, it's a juror
It's also this thing
It was very popular in the ancient world
The Avenger
The Avenger, right?
That's a servant of DK
That's as pagan as it gets
The Avenger, right?
Great, go to the next one
That's what our diecast is
What do we get on the Hebrew side?
It really is coming from this verb, right?
It's non-specifically judging or governing
Now, my problem is
The Greek already has a verb
For one who sits in judgment as a governor
And I think that's what this is probably closest to
And they would have known that
If I know that, they would have known that
In antiquity
Yeah, their linguists are great, right?
Classics is the first education
Yeah, love it
The museum comes from it
Okay, so we're going from the specific to the general
When we go from the Greek to the Hebrew
Now, remember, the story is
That it went from Hebrew to Greek
So as you're thinking about these translations
Realize what the person who would be translating it
Into Greek would have to do to ramp up
That technical expertise, right?
You either can do a triple lutz or you can't
And Hebrew was not able to do the triple lutz
And it's not the only language
There's a ton in Italy
All those dialects that the Romans wiped out
Linguistically, same thing
There are strong languages and there are weak languages
Yeah, love it
Now, here's your prophet, people
What else did he say he's going to take from him?
Prophets, I just want you to notice
Okay, this is one who speaks for God
That sounds pretty good
I want you to notice how many references there are
To different classical works that use this Greek word prophet
Prophet, okay
Notice, blow it up
Notice that it's a herald, sure
Look at the very bottom
Go to the next slide
What does it say?
It says herbalist
You mean your prophet is an herbalist?
I would have one objection
Yes, but it's more in a medical sense
So I would say pharmacologist
Yeah, that's what I would put it
You mean your prophets were on dope?
Yes, they were
Yes, they were
Love it
Go to the next one
Look at the three and four year people
An expounder of the utterances of the mantis
You guys know the mantis and the mantic art
You know that, that's all through Apollo
You thought the word prophet was
No, it's not Charlton Eston
No, that's a fantasy world
It's part of the big lie
We're peeling back that big lie tonight
Look at three and four
You know, a possessor of irracular powers
Look at where they're going
They're going to the oracles
Look, it's used of epimenides
He was a cool guy who had tattoos all over himself
And he would carry this cult's hoof
And in it, he would put this white root
That he would snort
Yeah, yeah, they kept his skin
Turned it into a book
Why not?
Go to the next one
Let's go to the next one
Are people commenting?
I'm going to get people's comments in a minute
Chewie, if there's any good comments, throw them up there
Look, people, what is the prophet on the Hebrew side?
A spokesman, a speaker
Okay, but then you're using a Greek term to define your Hebrew term
Because you're saying prophet
