That's a Greek term
Yeah, so do you see the depth here?
I asked you before, could you name me one Hebrew author
From antiquity outside
And I'm not talking, I'm talking BC
Okay, outside of the Septuagint
Give me one, I don't know, a seventh century dude
You thought Isaiah was eighth
Then certainly, if Isaiah is late iron age
Are we going to have some kind of record?
Are we going to have some kind of written?
No, you're not, because the stuff doesn't exist
The oldest inscriptions of Hebrew
People question them as even being Hebrew
Right?
Yeah, it's not the history that you thought was there
It was the history that was amplified that you've been fed
That you're living in
That you're breathing
Yes, okay, go, keep going
Let's give Isaiah another spanking
Let's go, people, love it while you can
While it's hot
Which one?
Okay, here we go
And what is the stohas on?
That's just something, a conjecture
I like that, I like that
Look where it says
That's Polybius they're talking about
And is he roughly contemporary?
Yeah, he's in the same range
From where our authors of the Septuagint are
So the person who really wrote the books of Moses
In the third century
We're getting closer to their specific lingo
And this is one of the words, fantastic
What's he gonna do?
He's gonna take away the people who can come up with the right plan
Right?
He's gonna take that away
It's a resource, I told you these are all resources that he's got there
It makes much more sense in the Greek
Than it does the terrible dumb-down Hebrew translation
It's a shame, this is a beautiful text
Here we go, what's the word for it?
That they're using for that
They're using this one
And what does that mean?
Want to practice divination
Are you kidding me?
Okay, what does that mean?
That's not a definition
It's not a definition, it's like a catch-all
Okay, what car are you in?
Well, I'm driving, thanks
Yeah, it's very nonspecific
And that's the problem, because remember Hebrew only has about 8,000 unique words
Right? They miss basic words
Why don't we have them?
Because it got slaughtered as a language
It was only the attempt to bring it back
Starting in the second century
The synagogues are still full of Greek
People realized, oh, we need some kind of original
To take command of this text
Yeah, yeah, isn't that something?
And so they wrote it, they created it
They were already doing it with the Dead Sea Scrolls
Right, they had the Greek originals there
And they had the Hebrew copies of them
Okay, watch this, watch how technical language
It shows it every time, it's the technical language
Hit me with the next one
Are you sure that far?
Okay, yeah, look at verse number 3
Who else is Yahu going to remove from society?
Look at the first word on the second line
Pente con tarjon
Pente con tarjon
What is that? Sounds important, right?
Look at the length of that
People, I don't do this always, but just love the length
Of that first word on the second line
Can everybody see that?
Love the look at that
How many?
I'd like to measure that word
I'd like to measure it
I would
It might cause some frightening reactions
It's gorgeous, isn't it? Pente con tarjon
Oh, it even sounds
It sounds like, I don't know
I don't know, it makes me want to, you know
Put on some music
Sorry, I got drawn in
And what else is Yahu going to take away?
He's going to take away the Pente con tarj
The what?
He's going to take away a specific position
What is that thing? Let's see
Let's see, Chewie, give me the next slide
What is that? Looks like it's got the word five
Give me the next one, this one
No, there we go, that's it
Look at this, people, commander
It's a commander of how many?
Of fifty, right?
Fifty!
Look where it's landing
It's landing in Xenophon
And he tells us this is somebody who serves under the Trierachos
This is the Trierachos
Yeah, and what does he do?
He's like an admiral?
Yeah, he has to outfit a tri-rame
Yeah, yeah, so this is a very specific, once again, Athenian word
Okay, let's see what the Hebrew did with it
Let's see, let's see
I'm willing to bet it's not nearly as specific
Blow it up, yeah, put it up there and blow it up
This is fantastic
Oh, God, what's the jury say?
Look, the captain of fifty
So use the number fifty and put the word for captain in there
Because you don't have this position, right?
So do you see, for the Greek to be a translation of the Hebrew
The dude would have to be stoned
He would have to be like, oh, God, how can I jazz this up?
How can I, you know what I mean?
So the captain of fifty, that's not real
That's not real inspiring, right?
But it's blunt and to the point, it's blunt and to the point
It's a loss of technicality
And watch as you wash out the technicality
It becomes nonsense, the translation becomes nonsense
And by the way, you can do this with any chapter of the Septuagint
Right, you might as well throw a dart at which chapter
And whatever you hit, try that
It's full of laughs, linguistic laughs
Oh, it's hilarious, it's hilariously bad
It's also sad, I feel like playing a violin or something
Give me the next one, give me the next one
Yeah, there's the captain of fifty, we know, we saw that
Let's go on to the next
Okay, and there's our commander who's serving under the tree of Ark
Yeah, okay, keep going
What else is he going to take?
He's going to take away the Sumbulon
Oh no, this is fantastic
Give me the definition that's coming up
What is a Sumbulon?
Watch this people, this is going to grow your brain
This is an advisor or counselor?
Okay, public or private, cool, that's cool
Look at all the sources around it
And you're going to notice, Athenian, fifth century
The majority, the first order is up there
The first comedian is up there
Yeah, the first Tragedian is up there
And a bunch of others
Oh god, oh god, look at it
As a title at Athens, the Thesmothetai
Okay, the Thesmothetes
They're the ones who appointed the Sumbuloi
And this is what Yahoo is going to take from you
Now, who is you?
The audience of this
Our third century disenfranchised culturally
Jewish religious extremists
Right, these are the guys in the caves
Copying documents
Right, brilliant move to do so
Because when you generate the big lie
You take a hold of the narrative
It gives you grounding and justification
To do whatever you want to do
And that usually involves the seizure
And acquisition of some land, some resource
That's how that works
Yeah, now, how can I say that?
Because that's exactly what they do with the language
If you look at the language as a resource
That's what this is doing
It's trying to draw down
That's what the Hebrew is doing
It's trying to draw down that sophisticated Greek
But put it into a vessel that was incapable of carrying it
It was too much
Right, burst the pot
Okay, let's go
Hit me the next one, let's hit it
Oh, yeah, here we go
This is the council, fine
To advise or to counsel
Right, okay
I think that's acceptable
Let's give them that one
Nice job, nice job
Whoever did this, nice job
What about this one?
What do you guys do with the Arhidektona?
Isn't that a good one?
Look, that's a big one too
Everybody in Greek, you see the Arhe
Sitting in there in the tekt
Oh, that production
Production is getting to me
It's from the Arhe
So how are we going to define it?
Stretch your mind
Everybody
The chief artisper
Artificer, excuse me
The master builder
The director of works
This is the guy who builds your bridges
It says in Greek
It's got Herodotus
It's got Aristotle
Look, where are we again?
Vocabulary wise people, where are we again?
We're hitting square
Every time at the fifth century
Down to the third
We're hitting it square
This is the exact language
That we would expect
Coming out of the third century
Exactly
An author, a contriver
And look at the final one
At Athens, by the way
This is the manager of the state theater
And of the Dionysia
Great festival ride
He's going to take those away from you
And you say, wait a minute
Where am I culturally?
Because unless
I am mistaken
The people of Israel do not
worship Bacchus
And that's who he's talking about
He goes on, the prophet
Isaiah goes on to talk
About those assemblies that we make
Those parades that we make
And all the women are there
And you've got your girls out
And they're gossamer clothing
And we're all getting aroused
Why aren't they
And burkas?
Right?
That's the, that's
Isaiah 3
It's Bacchic rites
So you have to ask yourself
Why in a text
Am I reading about Bacchic rites
In Judea?
Right?
Isn't that something?
Isn't that something?
Remember, we are sitting
In the third century BC
And we have been
Culturally disenfranchised
And a lot of us became traders
And embraced
The Greek ways
Yeah, now they're
Doing what they're doing
Totally integrated
Right?
If you are an extremist
You understand
The power
Of the logos
That's what they used in antiquity
Those histories, that material
From the libraries
Yeah
That was the reality
So when somebody comes along
And tries to fake
A text and say
This is the original
They're doing it for a very good reason
Right?
Legitimacy
When you need legitimacy
And are willing to sacrifice
Everything for it
You fabricate
Now
It's an unfortunate reality of history
Don't think that the Christians
Didn't
Mount up that wave
And ride it all the way in
Even though people like
Afrikanis, Julius Afrikanis
Was saying, this text is not written
In Hebrew
You people are nuts
In origins like, yeah
That's all he could do
