Hurry up
Let's go
Verse 13
I just wanted to show you
Something that's colloquial
That it's colloquial in Greek
Not in Hebrew
Verse 13 says
Now the Curios
Established a judgment
He
Brought a judgment
Upon the people
And it's using a verb
Which is based upon
The concept of standing
But it's been augmented
By the kath
To become established
To ground
To ready
Something
Yeah, and this is what the Hebrew do with that
Oh it's terrible
This is a slaughter
Turn away for those of you who have weak linguistic stomachs
Blow it up
Blow it up
He stands up
There's yahoo
Now look at yahoo
You can't tell that it's written that way
Could be yahoo too
So don't get mad at me
When I say yahoo
Thank you
And by the way
They use different ways to translate
For yahoo
Hashim
They use different ways
Of translating that from one
Greek term
Why would they do that thing?
Because they're composing it in the third century
And they're trying to split
They're trying to create their own
Identity
You can't just list
It looks like Greek
As they were trying to figure it out
They probably draft one and they were like, no way
That is way too
Transparently Greek
Right
Love it
Lo, amen is the man
I love that, thank you, that was a good one
Don't put any of the bad ones up
Alright, unless I'm going to hell
Let's go to one more
Keep going
Down wherever we were from last time
Yeah
Are we on the right?
Okay
Yeah, the schema, he's going to take this away too
We got to go back up
We missed a couple here
Hang on people, I'm sorry, I apologize
I have messed up my order here
Okay, there we go
What was the translation of that passage?
The translation is
The Lord stands up
No, it's a Greek idiom
Establishing justice
Right, is to
Rule
Yeah, is to bring that authority
To literally establish that authority
So there's no
There's no standing up
There's no actual standing up
Yeah, otherwise the Greeks
Wouldn't use that idiom
Right, they could just say that
The Lord stood up
Right, what you can see
Is the attempt of the rabbis
To draw down
The more sophisticated or complex
Greek into the
Limited capacity Hebrew
Unfortunate, it's an unfortunate
Linguistic exercise
Let's go to that one, good
Look at this people, verse 17
And God, watch this
Yeah
God's going to do what
He's going to humiliate
Those daughters of Zion
Who rule
Wait, what?
What?
Who's ruling?
Who are these women?
I'm starting to like this a little bit better
And Caicurios apocalubse
And the Lord
They may put
Yeah, they may not
It's whatever the particular circumstances were
Caicurios
And the Curios did what
He's going to do what?
He's going to apocalypse
He's going to reveal
What's he going to reveal?
He's going to reveal their schema
He's going to reveal
The schema
Of these daughters
Of Zion who are ruling
And you say
What is this schema?
What is he going to reveal of theirs?
Now watch this, it gets dirty
It's the Hebrew that makes it dirty
Not me, go ahead
What is this schema in Greek?
It's a form
It's a form of something
Right, a shape, they have
Look at B, it's an atom
Yeah, it's the appearance of something
As opposed to the reality
The appearance of something
And then look down at B
It's the dress or equipment
Do you know what he's going to do?
He's going to take away all that
Fine dress
And equipment
Of those ruling women
Now, let's see what the Hebrew
Made of that
Do we get it through?
The message comes through
Are you ready?
What?
Therefore he will strike with a scab
I know
That first part of the Hebrew
Is just the word and
I don't know where they're pulling
If you can even do that
With what?
I don't know
Okay, wait
Look
They used adonai
Here
So, they really
Don't know how to use
That Greek word properly
And they're cramming all of these gods
Into it, okay
Just wait, maybe they felt good
Because of Adonis, I don't know
But the Lord is going
To strike with a scab
The crown of the head of the daughters
Oh, there he is
Yahoo
Right, and what is he going to do?
Look at the second line
He's going to uncover their secret parts
Dirty
That's what is going on
In the mind of that author
Because that's not from the Greek
My goodness
Close your eyes, Chewie
The Bible is dirty
It's dirty stuff, and first of all
Why would he do that?
Like seriously
Right?
The Greek makes sense
It says he's going to take away
Their kit, their dress
Their jewels
He's going to take all of that away
It's nothing about
Their private parts is in there
Right now, if this is
As they want you to believe
As seminaries would have
You believe
As religious training
Whatever the monotheist
Religions you want
That don't worship the gods
Like the rest of us
Right?
They're going to have
This
As a background
They're telling you
The Hebrew is being translated
By the Greek
The Greek is the new copy
Right?
That's the original language
If that says in Hebrew
About the private parts
Of these women who are
Ruling
He's going to uncover that
The translator
Had to go from private parts
To schema
Which has nothing to do
With private parts
So either it's a bad translation
And Yahoo was bad
Because remember, Yahoo blessed this thing
And it was magically turned out
Maybe everybody wrote the same translation
Of these 72 guys
So either he's a bad translator
Or
More realistically
The language is just incapable of conveying
The original Greek
It's just the way it is
Watch these technical terms
I'm going to throw you
Give me the next one
And so
What is your English translation for?
So for everybody sitting in synagogue
Sitting there and you're reading through
Blah, blah, blah, therefore the Lord
Will smite with a scab on the crown of the head
That's not there
The daughters of Zion and you'll be like
That's a nasty thing to do, right?
And the Lord will discover their secret parts
Look, it's even
Discover because you can tell
The King James, remember
It was translated as
It was a little bit uncomfortable
With the whole private parts business
Where is the chorus?
Of my sisters of frustration
Where are you?
I can't hear you
I need to hear your shouts of ecstasy
Whenever we come across
It gets my goat
That we don't hear your shouts of ecstasy
Cause that's what we're
Whoops, here I am
That's hello Penelope
You got my goat
Everybody say hi to Penelope
I don't care if you dislike this portion of the show
I want you to focus on that
Cross
I want you to look at that cross
I want you to see it
I want you to see what it's covering
That cross
Covers a whole
Multitude of Penelope's sin
Okay, enough
Thank you Penelope
Good night
Wonderful to have her
We can't be that far up, are we?
Gnostic is going to fall asleep
Keep going, give me the next couple
Look, I wanted you to see this
I'm going to cut short the rest of it
I'm just going to show you
With this passage, for example
This is verse 18, so this is Isaiah 3
18
In that day
It says, the Lord
Is going to take away the glory
Of the hematism
And long story short
That is the way that one
Dresses
And what else is he going to take away
To Cosmos
You refer to Cosmos
As the woman's makeup kit
Yeah
So it can include jewelry
It's not just the drugs that they're putting
On their faces
Skin drugs
All sorts of drugs all over the place
Including those drugs
