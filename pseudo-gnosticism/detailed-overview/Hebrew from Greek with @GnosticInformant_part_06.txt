They're going to burn us down
Just like they did in the first
Yeah
It's the mission
Of monotheism
To dominate
And destroy
It's the mission
How's it coming?
The watchers are watching
By the way, did you see we had giants
And we didn't have Nephilim flying around
Right, no those are just prominent people
Thank you for coming tonight
I'm going to now give you
An added bonus
I'm going to hand
Over the stage
To
Gnostic informant
And before Gnostic informant
Starts speaking
I just want to let you know
That
His source work
Has been
Absolutely dazzling
Yeah, and I told him
I told him Neil
I told him that you
Purchased
Of the lobes
And you're eating up
You're trying to consume
Like some kind of artificial intelligence
Trying to consume everything
So you have a great
You have a great offering right now
And it's about some stuff
That I don't know
And I'm going to have to listen to your authority
Okay
Yeah man, thanks for having me on
Thanks for having me on dude
That was some interesting stuff
Just now hearing
About the linguistics side to this
Because I don't have no
I don't know anything about the linguistics
I have no
I don't have the knowledge
Of linguistics to be able to say
Who's translating from what
But those are some fucking slam dunk points
That I just heard right there
So I'm going to have to look into all that
That's amazing
I want to look at the historical side of this
Where's the evidence of
The big literary
Era
Of all these prophets and
Writers and scribes
We have prophets writing these
Long texts that are
About all these prophecies
Events that are happening
And politics and all this
So you would expect if you're writing these
You're writing to an audience right
You're writing to somebody
You're not just writing to nobody
So you would expect people
To write these texts
You would expect there to be
Like a chain of reactions to these texts
People talking back and forth
Something, anything
Well, we don't get that
So let me just say this
I want to start with
What are other people saying about
The origins of Israel
And the last time I was here
We had on
We were
We ended up on
A story about
The history of the Hebrews
It's a story that's only in a couple
Of sources I think Plutarch
Talks about it, Menetho
And then Hecateus Vabdera
His story seems to line up
With this story
It's an alternate account
And I looked into some of this stuff
And see, does this hold any water
I'm going to pull up a source from Loeb
I love this website too
This is amazing stuff
Make sure this is big enough for everybody
How's that? There we go
Actually, let me back that up
There we go. All right, so
Tacitus is telling this story
In the early 2nd century
About who are these Jews
We don't really know what's about them
They're kind of late on the scene
As far as ancient civilizations go
As far as the Egyptians
The Greeks, Punex
Phoenicians, Carthaginians
We don't know those people
They're in every text
We can find hundreds of people
Mentioning Carthage
Phoenicians, Egyptians
Ionians, Plaskians
Scythians
They're all over the place in these sources
But nobody
Ever mentions the Jews
Until
Well, okay
There's a couple of rocks that people have found
That mention certain kings
Very, very little bit
Like little city-state
So the evidence looks like this little city-state kingdom
Going on in Jerusalem
And in Jezreel
Other than that, no one's writing about these people
So what's going on here?
So let's read this story
I got a lot of things that I want to go through
But it's all going to come back
To what Ammo was saying
So he says
At the beginning of the same year
Titus Caesar, who had selected by his father
Subjugation Judea
He's basically saying like
We just subjugated this place, Judea
Let's go through the history
So he says
So this is what he says
It is said that the Jews were originally
Exiles from the island of Crete
Who settled
In the farthest parts of Libya
At the time when Saturn
Had been deposed
And expelled by Job
An argument for this
There is a famous mountain in Crete
Called Aida
Hence they had habitants called Aidaia
Which is lengthened in the Barbarian form
Udaia
Alright
Some hold that the reign of Isis
Is superfluous to the population of Egypt
On the leadership of Heroslemus
Which is in Greek
Means holy-minded
A name in Greek, it's interesting
You never hear about that
What does Jerusalem mean?
Atomology given by Tastis
It's named after a king
Named Heroslemus
And Uda
Discharged himself on the neighboring lands
And many others
Where is he getting this from?
Is this something to make up?
Just keep that in the back of your mind
It's still others report that they were Assyrian refugees
Landless people
Who first got control
Of a part of Egypt
And possibly maybe a little bit of both
Maybe the, so when I read this
My, I'm thinking the evidence shows
The Philistines
Evidence that the Philistines did come from Crete
And
The Assyrian refugees
Things sort of matches up with
These people coming together in this area
Called Canaan
So I'm going to keep continuing with this part
This is where it gets crazy
Most authors agree
That once during a plague in Egypt
Which caused bodily disfigurement
King Bacchorus
Approached the oracle of Ammon
I'm going to get to who this is in a minute
Just give me a second
King Bacchorus approached the oracle of Ammon
Asked for a remedy
Whereupon he was told
Wait am I still on the same page?
Okay good
Asked for a remedy where he was told
To purge his kingdom and transport this race
Into other lands
Since it was hateful to the gods
The neighbors were searched out
And gathered together
Then being abandoned in the desert
While all others lay idle and weeping
One only of the exiles
Moses
By name
Warned them not to hope for help from the gods
Or men
For they were deserted by both
But the trust to themselves
Regarding as a guide
Sent from heaven
The one whose assistance should first
Weep from their present distress
So he's basically saying
Whatever sign we get from heaven
That's going to be our god
That's what we're going to look for
A sign from heaven
To find a new god
Because the Egyptian Ammon does not like us
They agreed
And they set out on their journey in utter ignorance
But trusting to chance
Nothing caused them so much distress
As scarcity of water
And in fact
They had already fallen exhausted
Over the plain eye
Unto death when a herd of wild asses
Moved
From their pasture to a rock
That was shaded by a grove of trees
Moses followed them
And conjecturing the truth
From the grassy ground
Discovered abundant streams of water
This relieved them
And they marched six days continuously
On the seventh seized a country
Expelling the former inhabitants
And there they founded a temple
Dedicated the temple
So
The establishes influence over those people
And Moses introduced a new religious practices
Quite opposed to those of all other religions
The Jews regard as profane
All that we hold sacred
On the other hand
They permit all that we abhor
They dedicate it in a shrine
A statue of that creature
Whose guidance enabled them
To put an end to their waterings
And thirst
A statue of a donkey
Sacrificing a ram
In derision of Amon
They likewise abstain from the ox
Because the Egyptians worship it
Alright, that's the little story he gives
There's more on this too, but I'm not going to keep going
I just wanted to show that part
He gives this alternate origin story
That doesn't
It sounds like an exodus a little bit
You got Moses, you got the monitoring in the desert
But
There's a lot of different things happening here
We have a name of the Pharaoh now
We didn't get the name of the Pharaoh
In the Bible
People say Ramses
Doesn't say Ramses ever
There's no name, it just says Pharaoh
So in this text we actually get a name
So if we look at who is
Bacchorus
Here he is
Also known in Greek as Bacchorus
He's from the 24th dynasty
Alright, well how do we know that?
I mean we can just trust Wikipedia
But I want to show you how we know that
So
I'm going to go to
Alien
Let's go to Menetho
Menetho mentions this
Bacchorus, the 24th dynasty
Reigned for 44 years
And in his reign a lamb spoke
What?
Turns out that this was like
Some sort of event that happened
Where a lamb told the Egyptians
That they would be conquered by the Assyrians
