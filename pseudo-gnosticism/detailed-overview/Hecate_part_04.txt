What's wrong with that?
What's wrong with that guy over there?
He's all, you know
He's Christed on his mouth
This is application, people
You're applying
You're using that applicator
The alabasteran
Whether it's human
Whether it's flesh or not
Eat my flesh
Right, sorry
That was Jesus
Eat my flesh
And drink my blood
Remember?
That was the game
Galen's just describing the medicine
And what happens, you know
You've got to be Christed with the poopies
And then
And then what?
The worst thing is those people
Doing the Phoenician thing
Who are also doing the lesbian thing
And when I say lesbian
What do you know what I mean from lesbos?
Right, what does lesbos
What does this word mean?
Lesbos is an island
People, remember that
Let's all go to lesbos someday
Maybe the next one
What does lesbos
Or what does it mean to
Lesbiozzo someone
It says, do like the lesbian women
Thank you, we knew that
Or Latin
Felare
Felare
No
It's the wrong song
It's the wrong term
And this one
Is the word we use in English
When we say
Felatio
Yes, this is to perform
Felatio
Now
He's saying
The most medically
Questionable
Are the people who are
Involved in Felatio
Who are also
Doing the Phoenician
And what is the Phoenician thing they're doing?
What is the Phoenician?
Well, that's an
That's two
Imitate the Phoenicians
Well, how so?
Well, you know,
Victorian Alfred tells us
It's unnatural vice
Unnatural vice
So I see
This is somebody
Who is performing
Felatio
Upon
That
Poopy
Phoenician
Dragon
Yeah
That's exactly what he's saying
So that one medically
Is the most, you know
If you're Christing in this way, people
You know, they used to tell us
When I was, you know,
Youthful
They used to say
You know, watch out for HIV
I was back with Dr. Fauci
I was reading his papers
In graduate school
Shout out to Dr. Fauci
I read your papers, brah
And the things that you did
To make progress in HIV
Research and acceptance
Of not shunning people
With a disease
That was, you know
You got crad, man
You got crad in the under
You got crad, definitely
Hail Satan
Let's go to the
Let's go to the
Oh, look at this
We're getting some comments
I love that
Flash those up there to me
Make sure you get the good ones
Right?
Yeah, let's go to the next one
Here's the phoenix
We knew that
You know, here's the purple
I just wanted you to see the purple
We got purple women, you know what I mean
The Phoenician women
That we talk about
Keep going
That wasn't really relevant
I wanted to move
Are we...
Oh, here's Homer
Homer, look people
I just want to show you
End of the first line
Look at the second and last word
Phoeniki
I just want you to see
This purple stuff
It's in the oldest documents
That we've got
Right?
So when you see them
Dying things
In say, Homer
Like they like to die
Halters for horses
They like to die
The belts
Belts were a big thing
Aphrodite has this gorgeous
Beautiful belt
So stained with purple
She's been baptized with purple
Oh, God
Who wants that?
Who wants that?
Raise your hand if you want
Aphrodite, Cestus, please
Please
Ah
It's got the purple
We got it going
Right?
Galen's, you know
This is old, old, old
Right?
This tech is
Ancient to them
