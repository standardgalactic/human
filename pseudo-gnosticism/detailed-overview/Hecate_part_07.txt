Because she is that Iohaea
The pour of poison arrows
The pour of poison arrows
You mean Hekate?
Is this divinity?
Yes
Hekate is that one who shoots that bow
She is the one who
Oh, God, you know what she...
You know who walks around with her?
A whole bunch of black wolves
Odysseus was so scared once
Why is that?
Because Cersei...
Remember, Odysseus has been held for seven years
By one woman named Calypso
And then he gets captured by another woman
Which was probably just the trade to start with
I'll bet you that's what it was originally
It was just the trade
But he ends up with another woman as her sex slave
And what happens in the process?
What happens in the process?
When he whines and complains a lot
He cries on the beach
He sits and cries on the beach
This is the Bronze Age, man
You mean he wasn't...
Oh, my man!
No, he wasn't
He wasn't tanning his testicles either
No, he was being held captive by a woman
And crying a lot
She abused him and pumped him full of drugs, man
What a world!
What a world!
And what did Cersei teach him?
She said, you want to go to the underworld?
And he was like, yeah, I do!
I want to see my daddy!
Right, or whatever
Whoever it was that he was going to see his dad
Still alive at that point
But whoever it was
Or the Killies or someone that...
Oh, Agamemnon
Right, oh, God
Right, because when he got back
He got killed
By another woman who was called the Dragon Priestess
Did you know that his wife was called the Dragon Priestess?
Who, in their right mind
Would mess around on somebody called the Dragon Priestess
Seriously
He had it coming
He came back with this priestess that he abducted
And was...
I can't use the R word
Yeah
And he's got her with him
So, guess what?
The Dragon Queen bashed his head in
While he was taking a bath
She buried Naxx in his brain
After putting and wrapping him up in a net
Yeah, carpet
Isn't that funny?
I think it was purple, I don't know
Go back and check
Somebody check
What it...
The period is not what you think it is
The world is not what you think it is
We live in a world that is heavily, heavily, heavily misogynist
Whether people are throwing acid in the face of women
Or whether they're saying
You got to walk 10 feet behind me
Or I'm going to go in this section
And you got to go sit up there
Because that's where all the people like you sit
Right?
They weren't doing that then
Yeah
There was something, a power
There's power in the femininity
There's power in it
That's what you find in Hecate
Right?
Classical authors are known for saying
Hecate
Once a month, all the rich bastards
Right?
Who don't deserve to hoard what they've got
And starve everybody else
All the rich bastards have to go down
To the shrines of Hecate
And they have to leave food
Nice food too
Not these canned goods garbage
Nice prepared meals
Nice
And you know who goes and picks them up?
It's all the poor people
It's all the poorest of the poor
Because that is what Hecate does
Yeah
You know that feminine goddess you thought existed?
This is her
This is her
This is the ultimate and highest enemy
Of Judaism, Christianity and Islam
And you know who can tell you that?
Is the people
The people, the women and the burkas
Who are starting to fight
That's who you can tell about that
Oh God
Tell the Philistine women too
Tell them all
Love it
Give me the next one
Give me the next one
Got a little patriotic there
Yeah
Look what's happening people
What comes out of the mouth of Hecate?
She says, I tell you
What do I tell you?
I tell you all things true
Imagine that
A force of nourishment
A protector of the poor
Who only speaks the truth
Do you see where Jesus had His model?
Jesus is not a made-up figure
Jesus is not a fictional character
The people who arrived in the New Testament
Are not trying to take Greek figures
And just slam them down
Right from the literature
Right down into their own works
They're not doing that
Jesus is living in a system
That venerates this identity
When he goes down to Egypt
And he's got his trust fund
Comes back so educated
What do you think he was educated in?
Yeah
In the language of Greek
That this thing
That this mystery
The word mystery is a Greek word
The word mystery is a Greek word people
The word Christ is a Greek word
When are you going to see it?
Christ Jesus is that Hecatech light
When he says, I'm the light of the world
Give me the next one Chewie
Give me the next one
