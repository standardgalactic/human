And I got something coming to you.
You know what that is?
Oh, you're going to get the goodies.
You're going to get those things about those works that are on the stones of healing, the
stones of medicine, that earth, compressed earth of medicine.
Yeah.
You're going to...
And go back to that.
I'm sorry.
This was...
Oh, sorry.
Keep it on there.
Keep it on.
Gorgeous.
Oh, I love that.
Yeah.
I feel it.
God, it's gorgeous.
Thank you, Chewy.
That was fantastic.
Sometimes I short Chewy too much on those times and Chewy is genius, right?
Yeah.
So, yeah, this is all those things that bring us to the Remediorum.
Remediorum.
Remediorum to the drugs.
Woo!
We made it to the drugs.
Hit the next one.
Let's go in.
What was that?
They were writing back and forth about...
I'm going to give you these.
I'm going to give you the sources on this and you can make this drug.
Those guys were used...
There's not an emperor that wasn't using drugs, man.
You can get them all.
This is fantastic.
Let's go to these drug-using people and see what they're writing about.
Here's some Greek.
Oh, I love this.
This is in the back.
If you go to the...
If you find Orpheus and the lithica and you snoop around a little bit, Auto-Kern and
people that came before, you'll find this collection as well.
It's described as a kind of a summary of the teachings.
It uses the same word that we use in the New Testament to say to preach.
Yeah, so these are the preachings, the lithic preachings of Orpheus.
Are you ready?
And you say, Orpheus, yay, we're all in cult.
Now, look at these people.
I'm about to give you cult texts, full of drugs and sex and cult and the real origins
of the mystery.
Nobody's doing this.
Why?
It's not magic.
It's just the sources because we're respecting them.
I'm not sitting here trying to sell you a line.
I'm not trying to get you to buy a book.
I'm not trying to get you to believe some kind of argument so I can be on some kind
of BS ride of looking at myself in the mirror and all of that circle jerkery.
I have no interest in that.
Here's the text.
Let's bring this up.
See what these druggies said.
Let's bring it up.
Okay, look at this.
Okay, you're going to love this, people.
I'm so excited.
I'm glad you can only see me from the neck down.
Lethos ostrites.
Oh, look at that.
What kind of lethos is this?
It's something called ostrites and all of my great students.
It's got the oistress root in it.
It's got the oistress root.
What is that?
Oistress?
That is the bow poison.
It's the madness you get in.
It's the state you get in.
Okay, sorry.
Let's calm down.
Calm down.
There's a lethos called ostrites.
Yeah.
And when it's combined with wine and consumed, it's a complete remedy for pain.
It gets rid of all pains.
Totally.
That's it.
You're done.
No more pain.
You can't have pain on this bad boy.
Okay, right?
Here we are at the rave.
Here we are at the rave in 500 BC.
Wait, what?
Nice rave.
Let's see what we're doing.
Look, we're on cypress.
