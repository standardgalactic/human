Okay.
Those, those people are there too.
And who else?
Then we got just acolytes.
Don't we?
Did we just people following?
Acumuthois.
Yeah.
We got acolytes there.
And acolytes of food, Dionysus.
Bump, bump, bump, bump.
This is fantastic.
Fantastic.
And what is it all leading us to?
It's leading us to Mantea.
Mantea.
What do you want to do when you go to your concert?
All right.
What do you want to do when you go to your concert?
You've been through your purification.
And you're on your way to Aphrodite.
You're on your way.
Don't worry.
She's on the top of the hill in the temple.
Bump, bump, bump.
This is us getting ready.
This is us getting ready to like it.
Go.
Thumping.
Pounding.
Love it.
Love it.
And the pain.
Oh, the pain.
Oh, it's not there anymore.
It's not there anymore because they've given you the drugs.
Fantastic.
This is the way to go.
Does anybody need a prescription for this ride?
This should be doctors should be able to write this out.
Hey, you, you know what you need?
You need a weekend on Cyprus, the festival of Aphrodite.
Okay.
Just do whatever their doctors tell you.
Just take whatever their doctors tell you to take.
Okay.
So here we are.
What does Bacchus do?
He always brings the Aphrodite.
Go to the next text, Chewie, please.
I just wanted to throw.
Wait a minute.
Can we see the one before that?
I meant to give you the, yeah.
Yeah.
We skipped out on this one, right?
This thing has dulled our pain, right?
Especially that from all of the Ophic, all the serpent stuff.
It's Exio Menon.
It's Exio Menon.
Yeah.
What is that X Eos?
You can hear the X plus the Eos.
You can hear that poison.
Did you know the same root in Greek is used to say poison and to heal, poison and to heal.
And this is not one that people will typically, it does this in several different ways in
Greek because they had this concept.
They had this old Pulaski and concept that filters in, filters in through the medical
side.
Yeah.
And they have a, oh, God.
Once we're in the pain, the theriac will boost us to the place that we can contain that
passion, that we can hold that passion and through that power can see her.
That's, that's, that's where we pull up the text again.
I want to see that one more time.
What do we leave off in there?
Yeah.
One word, one word that means to heal and to poison.
If you're Apollo, if you're Artemis, if you're one of the twins, you shoot that arrow.
What's on that arrow?
That arrow is death.
That's the death bringer.
You mean the God of healing is the God of death?
Yes.
Yes.
The chorus leader is that God's sister.
That God's sister is the chorus leader and she's called the poison poor.
Are you seeing it?
People, as we're climbing that hill to the mountain that has the temple where Aphrodite
presides.
Do you see it along the way?
This is she who pours the poison for us.
Fantastic.
I hear that, you know, we're getting closer.
We're getting closer.
You can feel the effects of what they gave me in 800 BC.
This is fantastic.
Same text again, should we please?
Let's finish it off.
