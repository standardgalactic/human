Well, you got me to come back.
It's gorgeous, and I appreciate it, because here and now, on this sabbat, we can finally
be in a place where we can function freely.
Everybody has a lender, but not me.
Just that stuff on the top of the mushroom, you lick it off, and it's real.
You know what I mean?
I don't know.
But I want to talk about these things.
And so I want to find out, I want to look at what's going on.
I want to find, I want to introduce you to Peter Jesus.
I want to introduce you to a Jesus that you do not know, but a real Jesus.
