Ah, without further ado.
Isn't that cool?
That's one of the coolest things I've ever seen.
You're following the fairy tale.
You're not looking at history in reason.
You're looking at the fairy tale.
Your faith will lead you to the end.
You're looking at history in reason.
You're looking at the fairy tale.
Your faith will lead you to the fairy tale to accept it.
Reason will lead you to the reality.
