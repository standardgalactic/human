I'm going to bring in...
when Brian...
when Brian went on Joe Rogan for the first time,
he emailed me and he said,
hey, can you assure me that X, Y, and Z
about the sources?
You know, he's firming up his base.
And I said, yes.
I wrote him back a little explanation.
He said, can I...
can I mention you on Joe Rogan?
And I said, yes.
Only, only if you talk at least one sentence
about Jesus being arrested with a naked boy.
Only, don't bring up my name otherwise.
And the name was never brought up.
Right?
You see how far when you go back to what is real,
that science, when you go back to those sources,
it makes all of the garbage that you are fed,
all of the fairy tale that you're fed,
it just dissipates like a cloud of flatulence
and the sisters of insecurity.
Yeah, yeah.
They're a branch of the sisters of frustration.
You know, it's a kind of convent type deal.
I took a trip once.
Anywho, let's get back to it.
Let's put that down.
That's dynamite.
We don't want to raise that.
So, back to the sources here.
We're with Iota.
Well, guys, I want you to drift with me into Iota.
Look at this.
So, it's a voice.
It's a voice of crying.
Just that, yeah, yeah, yeah, right.
A voice or a cry.
And look, follow down the branches.
You away, you away.
A cry of men or women.
A cry of war and, you know, a blast of this effort.
That cry.
Oh, God, it's so delicious.
Ea, right?
What is this?
It's a form of Eos, right?
That has a different genitive.
We're talking about heterochlytein, heterochlytein differences
between nominases and genitives.
Oh, my God, that's nerdy, right?
But look at number, look at A, letter A arrow.
Okay, plural of Eos.
It can be, okay, wait a minute.
Just all from that little Iota?
Yeah, just all from that Iota.
And from that Iota, we also get Eos.
A poison.
As of serpents.
Oh, man.
Venom.
Venom, mad dog.
Venom.
It's the honey with which snakes fed Iamos.
Right?
Iamos.
Who is Iamos?
You hear that Iota people?
Iota is right in the middle of those seven, right?
Iota has three on one side and three on the other.
Do you hear Iota?
Have you found the seven stars?
Have you found the seven stars yet?
Iota, she is right in the middle.
Balancing the alpha and the epsilon and the eta on one side
and then the other side.
The Omicron, Upsilon and Omega.
We're right at that bridge.
Right at that fourth.
Right?
Okay.
Here we are.
Love it.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Boom.
Oh, Iodzo.
What does Iodzo mean?
Look, I just want you to see there's a little bit of violet
as we're painting this picture of Iota.
I want you to see we're in the violet spectrum.
Love it.
Next one.
Boom.
Yeah.
Oh, now we're getting a little bit out there, right?
Pulling in some consonants, getting a little bit out there.
Cry.
Shout.
Right?
Using tragedy.
Be wail.
To be wail the dead, right?
To wail the dead.
A thing.
Sound.
Right?
It's a sound.
We're, and where are we finding it at the bottom?
Look, the Orphic Argonautica, right?
So, you know, we're right in the right place.
Especially, look at the bottom.
There's a Diagama in there as well.
Right on the bottom.
They got a Diagama before.
Wiach.
Right?
Wiach.
Here's the name.
Iacos.
Mystic name of Dionysus.
Look at that.
What we found in the Iota.
The song and his honor.
Look at number two.
Where's the song and his honor?
Homusticos.
Right?
The Mystic Iacos.
The Mystic Iacos.
Oh, God.
Some kind of special chorus.
Some kind of special chorus.
We're there with the Iota.
We're there with the Iota.
We're with that chorus.
Again, how do we always come back to that bucket chorus?
Because people, we're here for the mystery.
You're here for the initiation.
Right?
Tonight, we're going to initiate some people from Harvard.
Fantastic.
Bring the next one.
Bring the next one.
Leave the pig bin for now.
We'll come back to them.
Right?
Right?
Oh, this is Iaomai.
So, Iaomai, right?
