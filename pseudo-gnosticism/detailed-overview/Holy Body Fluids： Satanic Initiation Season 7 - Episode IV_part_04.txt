Right.
This is the application of his hands.
Yeah.
And how's he doing?
He's got his hand in his mouth and everything.
He's putting them in the eyes.
He's got to put the drugs on you.
Right.
He's got to put you through it.
He's curing these people.
He's curing these people.
He's Christing them.
Did you say he's Christing them?
Yeah.
We'll look the text.
Bring me the next one.
Chewie.
Boom.
Look at this.
This is Mark 733.
Yeah.
So, oh God.
So he took him away.
This is just Jesus and poor one of his people that he's going to, you know, he's going to
open him up.
He's going to open him up.
Yeah.
He needs help.
Right.
It's medical.
He's a great physician.
You bonehead.
Right.
And what does he do?
What does he do here?
He takes this guy off.
Right.
From the crowd by himself.
Right.
Which sounds a tad shady in the Greek.
Don't get me wrong.
That katidee on there at the end.
It's a little bit of shade of let's go somewhere.
Yeah.
Yeah, let's go somewhere.
Come on.
You and me.
Let's go.
And anyhow, and what does he do when they're all, when they're all by themselves?
Look at the line too.
The Bible has perverted people.
Just wait.
Just wait.
Ebalin tus doctus.
He put his fingers where?
Esta otta.
Into his ears.
Okay.
So this man has just taken you.
Has just taken you in the back alley.
Okay.
Man, I don't know.
Maybe it was somewhere nice.
Maybe at a room somewhere.
I don't know.
It could have been.
It could have been out in the street for all.
Well, it had to be somewhere where they were all by themselves.
So I don't know.
Maybe they went in a restroom.
Yeah.
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, they didn't have any built there.
Right.
It's a little too early.
Right.
Judea is a terrible, terrible place.
The Romans make fun of it constantly.
It's backwater.
And anybody who gets assigned there, it's because they slept with the emperor's cousin
or something.
You know what I mean?
Maybe he was getting tortured for it.
Okay.
Go to the next source.
Here's Mark.
Yeah.
So, oh, and what does he do there?
Yeah.
Look.
Oh, God.
So he's got his fingers in his ears.
He's got his fingers in his ears.
Okay.
All right.
So I'm like, well, here.
Is he doing the doctor thing?
Looks like the doctor thing.
Is he going to stethoscope him or something?
No.
He spits.
Yeah.
He spits.
Now, notice is going to clarify where he spits.
And I really, okay, people, think about this for a minute.
We know about the cobras, right?
We know about the spitters.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Um, if we spit in people's eyes or into their mouths and notice is going to clarify this.
Let me be an adult.
I was relishing that too much.
If, if I were to come to your house, float through the door magically and put my fingers
in your ears and spit into your mouth and then work your tongue.
That's what it says.
Yeah.
I'm not quite sure.
Um, I'm not quite sure.
That's what it says.
Yeah.
I'm not quite sure.
Um, but I would suspect that there would be something that you just gave me in that spit
that, um, is affecting my, what does it do for this guy?
Oh God.
It's a specific drug that he's employing and it's from the house of dawn.
It's the dawn bringers.
Yeah.
The dawn bringer.
The dawn bringer calls it.
The dawn bringer drug.
You want the cult?
I'll bring you in.
The boys at Harvard, you can drop out now because you're never going to get this deep
into the text.
You don't care about these texts.
What?
That's not Henry Cavill.
Is it?
No.
Okay.
Oh, it's Jesus.
What?
Jesus.
I'm surprised we don't need a cross for that one.
Uh, let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
Seriously?
That's a cut.
Jesus.
Nice job on the, look at that.
He's got the classical proportions there.
