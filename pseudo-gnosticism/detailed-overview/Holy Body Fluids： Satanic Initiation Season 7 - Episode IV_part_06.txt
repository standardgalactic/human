What's that?
Penelope.
I like that.
Penelope, the goat.
Don't look there, you dirty people.
Don't do that.
This is standards here.
It's educational.
What I'm doing, let me explain, what I'm doing is I'm associating that cross with my
inability to show anything of nature that would entail something underneath a goat's
tail.
Yeah.
Mm-hmm.
And who doesn't love goats, man?
Seriously.
You can never have enough goats.
I know one of us has like, how many did she have?
It's like 20?
20 goats?
Get more.
Get more.
Keep getting goats.
Make a giant goat school.
Love it.
A school for wayward goats.
So, ace colpon.
Oh, this is spitting people.
We can divert omens this way, right?
We can spit into our colpons.
What?
Yes.
We can.
Let those of you with ears to hear, hear.
Let's go to the next.
Boom.
Look at this.
So, yeah.
So Jesus knew the jig was up, says this, I'm translating it, right?
So that the scripture could be fulfilled, he says, I am thirsty.
We're back on the cross with him.
I just wanted to see Jesus yelling out.
I think I just wanted you to imagine for a minute, Jesus yelling out, I am in the thirsty
zone, right?
Will somebody shut that guy up?
He keeps screaming about something to drink.
He's driving the cops crazy.
They're taking him water bottle after water bottle.
Go.
No, seriously.
They just gave him drugs.
And there was this scewo sitting there, right?
And it's full of that oxos.
And what happens?
Somebody puts a sponge up with the oxos, right?
They're holding it there over his mouth.
And what happens?
Go to the next one.
Go to the next one.
Yeah.
Yeah.
All of a sudden I transported this.
We're going to Bethsaida, right?
And there's this dude there that, you know, he's got a disability, you know what I mean?
And they're begging him, do something about it.
Use your hands, brah.
Get handsy with him, this blind person.
And what happens?
What happens?
Keep going.
Keep going.
Let's see what happens.
He takes him aside.
You know what I mean?
And he's, he does what?
He takes him out of there and spits in his eyes.
He puts his hands in his eyes.
He says, what do you see now?
Right?
Okay.
This is that Jesus.
Go to the next one.
Look at what he's actually doing, people.
This is good stuff.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's just about restoring his vision.
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
And here's the actual, now here's the pit-bit that I want to give you from John.
This is from the Gospel of John, right?
And he's, again, he's here, he's, after he said these things, you know, he spits on the
ground.
And what does he do?
He makes a payload.
He makes a payload, which is like a paste or sometimes translated as a clay.
Yeah.
From the ptuzmatos, yeah, from the stuff that came out of his mouth, right?
And he's going to put this payload now on his eyes.
Well, that makes sense.
It's perfectly in line with what the doctors are doing.
What is a ptuzma?
Well, ptuzma is sputum.
Sputum.
And you say, amen.
Jesus.
Jesus is just being a good doctor.
Amen.
Jesus is just being a good doctor until you see number two.
What the more that guy is such a serpent venom junkie.
Now, this makes perfect sense, people, because we all know that that stuff in their mouths,
that stuff can kill you.
That temple guardian that we call the medusa, she has stuff that runs out of her mouth.
It can kill you.
She will spit it into your eyes.
You wonder why you got to cut her head off.
She'll spit it into your eyes.
And when that slather, when that foam, and Nick, notice is going to describe it as foam.
Just wait.
We're going to look in Jesus' mouth in a minute.
This is the most disgusting dental trip you've ever taken in your life, but we're going to
go.
Nobody's ever gone.
Wait, Chewie, has anybody been here?
This is uncharted.
This is uncharted.
Nobody's gone in Jesus' mouth.
Oh, my God, people, we just hit the outer sector.
We just hit the outer rim, baby.
Jesus' mouth.
Nobody.
Nobody's gone.
Who's gone to Jesus' mouth?
Why did you go into Jesus' mouth?
I saw him.
He was in the alley with this dude.
Right?
He's doing stuff with it.
There's tongue stuff going, right?
What the?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Why are his fingers in his ears?
What's he doing?
Put your fingers.
Watch.
Watch what happens.
Watch what happens.
Get that stuff on your finger.
Put the fingers in the, yeah, yeah.
Of course, I wanted to see what it was that he was had in his mouth.
Let's keep going.
