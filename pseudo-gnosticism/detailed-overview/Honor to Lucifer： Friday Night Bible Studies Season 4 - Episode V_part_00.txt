Drinking whiskey, when that whiskey's burnin'
Do my veins, Indian goes crazy
And the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've got your selling, and you got your
Drinking whiskey, oh yeah
Drinking whiskey, oh yeah
Welcome to the season finale
Of Lady Babylon
Tonight is our second and final Bible study
That we skipped and now we're gonna slide into the finale
And it's a big end that we're coming to
I want to, I'm so proud
To be able to bring to you tonight the name Satan
I'm so proud to be able to bring this to you
Unfortunately, you know how it is guys
In order to get there, we're gonna have to cut through
Some people, we're gonna have to hack and slash
We're gonna have to purify, bring in those demons
Fill the whole place with sulfur, you know how it goes
This place needs a shakedown tonight on Lady Babylon
Let's go
Fantastic, I want to get right into it with a couple of comments
I just want to, we have a good and a bad
A good and a bad
So I want to bring those
Chewie, hit us with the good
Let's see the good, I like the good best
Always like that good news first
This is from Valerie Moore, such passion Chewie
Where do you get the images?
You are awesome, you have the receipts
Let's get rid of the lies and deceits, the deceit they preach
The more I watch you, the more my eyes are opening
Thank you so much, I am privileged
We're all privileged with you teaching this knowledge
Thank you very, very much Valerie
That's the nicest thing in the world
And Chewie wanted me to also say thanks
And let you know that these images are coming to you all
From the Wiki source
So yeah, love it, love it
We're staying within a realm
And it's nice to know, thank you
It's nice to know that the evidence is getting out there
Right, channels open, radios on
Fantastic, let's get the bad now, bring the bad
Quick, oh this one I pulled up
This bad I pulled up from a podcast by John Price
Dr. John Price, Sacred Speaks
Yeah, and I just, I missed these comments
I haven't gotten any of these lately and I'm really missing them
So this is from DeCollins
When Yeshua comes back
You will regret these words
Yes, yes
Oh Yeshua
Who's this guy Yeshua, I keep hearing about
To be honest, I look for him, I can't find him anywhere
Okay, fantastic, let's jump into it
Tonight I want to set your mind
Remember, last time we didn't come back from our trip
Right, we didn't come back, we're still
We left that capsule going, that space capsule's running
And we stuck ourselves, boom
We stuck ourselves in the second century
Stuck ourselves there tonight in order to find Satan
In order for us to be able to say
Okay, this is our museum
We're not giving it back to you people
We don't care where you're from
We don't care what you think, we don't care what your theories are
We're going to keep this, the museum is ours
Okay, so tonight I want to set you in that place
With this first video that we're going to watch
And kick them in, subliminal light speed, Yeshua
On my mark, hit it
Thinking about the days that used to be
High on a mountain standing all alone
Wondering where the years of my life have flown
Oh, I wonder if you ever think of me
