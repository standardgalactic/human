It is what is in Zeus's neuro
that cause him to become erect.
Okay, I think I'm getting it.
Now it makes sense why saturion
that is used by those who follow saturnas or satannas,
that saturion is used to get me into the state
where I am tense with respect to Aphrodite.
And sure enough, we have ancient depictions of this, right?
We have ancient depictions of this.
Apparently it's quite, it's quite the deal.
But in order to be a satyr,
now you're gonna recognize the satyrs,
in order to be a satyr, you have to have,
you have to have that son of God power.
You have to.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, it doesn't matter if your initiation
involves a boy or a girl.
You still have to have that power.
That is the sign that you are following
in the kingdom of satan.
Mm-hmm.
You're on that throne.
A few months ago, everybody here,
we all had the privilege of looking at a recipe,
parts of a recipe by a physician of Nero's.
And it was a recipe for a theriac,
one of these religious antidotes,
compound antidotes that they're using.
And cult, right?
In situ, in right.
And we had the privilege of seeing
that a part of something called the Orphic Vox
is, which is this language.
It's a coded language written on the back of a text
using words like mini-throned
to represent mini-drugged.
We saw that mini-throned was used for the theriac.
It was a way of referring to the communion substance.
It is also a way of referring.
The title is used again for Kierke, for Xerzi.
Who, yeah, who enters into union with Crony and Zeus?
Yeah.
Of the waters, the waters of creation.
Yeah.
You like that?
You thought that waters of creation?
You thought that was...
Yeah, yeah, it's the Egyptian.
Pulascian.
Yeah.
Pulascian, before any Egyptian, anything appeared.
Pulascians were doing it.
The rich are coming through them people.
And Prometheus was an idiot.
Wait, what?
That's what they thought?
Yeah.
He was the bad example.
Yeah, welcome to your own stupidity.
It said, know yourself on the door when you came in.
Oh my goodness.
Don't you love it?
Don't you love it?
We can just roll in this stuff.
I love it, I love it.
Okay, I wanna see if we have any more on the text,
the last text there, right there.
Give me that one.
Here, here we have from Ceterion, right?
Plant that excited lust.
Yeah.
There you go.
Or a drink prepared from it, right?
Cause that's what they'll do.
They'll call the drink the same thing as the plant, right?
Give me some hemlock.
Did you know they drink hemlock for recreation?
Yeah, puts you into a psychotic state before it kills you.
Isn't that nice?
So these death-bringing drugs are pretty important.
It's a whole class.
