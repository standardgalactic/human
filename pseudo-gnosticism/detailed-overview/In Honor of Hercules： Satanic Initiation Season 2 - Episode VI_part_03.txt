what it did is it almost took my soul but I found the God and goddesses at an
early age excellent response nice throw okay Neil this looks like I'm excuse me
snappy this looks like this looks like you know good luck with this one that's
that was a great answer snappy I'll read the question again have you ever been
molested or physically groped by Jesus or one of his disciples yes quite
literally as a young person I was very vulnerable I was a queer person looking
for help and I was targeted by Christian extremists through friends and I was
brought to a youth group and I confided in one of these priests about my feelings
and he took advantage of me and exploited me in the black room and molested my
mind and made me hate myself for most of my life and this is something that I've
been dealing with until now and it's brought me here and this is giving me
the rage to fight against Christ to fight against this oppression and to see
the abuse for what it is so yeah I've seen the literal darkness that these
people instill and I'm here to wait for oh wow point to snappy that was that was
one on a technicality of you brought it to the real you know what I mean you
brought it down I mean I thought I thought it was a great move it was a
great great move by Kthonius but wow you came around it hey people if you can't
appreciate that nice nice okay so we're one-on-one the deciding point of this
section this game the match will be more than one game but of this game is to this
third question we'll start with snappy what is the future of Christianity there
is no future of Christianity its future is to be overthrown its future is to be
turned into dust and to be forgotten we need to rise up we need to point out the
oppression that it has caused we need to take that role of the Satan the
accuser and we need to expunge it from our history and show it for the
pedophilic see like pedophilic awful cult of death that it is that's you know
the future of Christianity is nothing it's stagnation it seeks to stop time
it's anti-progress it's anti-change it's everything I oppose all right good
good answer you cut you're coming into this I don't know I don't know that was a
you know is this is a big decider that was a pretty strong answer there so
I'm still riding on snappies on snappies abuser as well I'm still riding on
those fumes you know what I mean because he's got righteous indignation here you
got okay yeah take a breath sonius and do it here we go what is the future of
Christianity ashes and I'll start with the Vatican when the truth comes out the
Pope and the Catholic Church will lose all power and those popes in the bishops
