I want to bring you Lucifer and I want you to be very careful about listening to what he says.
Ladies and gentlemen, from the satanic congregation of Lady Babylon, welcome Lucifer.
Thank you very much.
It's good to see you all.
I know Armen gets a little bit excitable.
I want you to know though that it was a real honor to be able to award him this access.
The fact that he was able to pull a 93 out of an audience that was full of what did he call them?
Sisters of frustration.
That was fantastic.
And I am very happy to give him the go ahead with the apocalypse.
Thank you, Armen.
Thank you.
But before we begin, I thought I might tell you just briefly a little story about Armen.
Wait, wait, wait, it's the nun's story.
He's going to tell the nun's story.
Yes, the one about the nun.
Nazareth, Armen.
Armen was studying there and he was staying in a nunnery.
