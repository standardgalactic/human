It was a show in Nazareth.
I wanted it to be special.
I wanted to take her somewhere that she was forbidden to go.
You know who it was.
It was Eve and I wanted her.
I wanted her just like you.
Just like you, I wanted her to have that.
To be that instrument made to sing the most beautiful to open up the universe.
It was an amazing show in Nazareth.
And the fact is that Alman was unafraid that he was willing to be that gadfly.
He was willing to play that instrument until the most beautiful music was produced.
He knew about Eve.
You know it was Michael.
He's the one that had to do it.
I don't know how you convinced them, but it always happens.
It's always the switch that takes place.
Yes, I know, I know, I know.
It's that that he holds over me.
