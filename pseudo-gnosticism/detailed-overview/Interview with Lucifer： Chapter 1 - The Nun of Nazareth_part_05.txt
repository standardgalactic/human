It's all part of them.
Sitting on the throne.
It is my hope that you will be able to see that your eyes will be opened.
There are things here that will be revealed.

His endearing love and respect for the Muse gives him a certain underworld authority.

I'm going to bring this back to you.
Right?
Thanks to him.
I'm going to bring this back to you.
Of course.
This is all about the Dawn.
We will bring her back.
