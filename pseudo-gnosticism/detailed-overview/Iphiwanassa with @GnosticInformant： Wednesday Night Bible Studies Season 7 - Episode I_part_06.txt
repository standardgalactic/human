They're all doing the same thing
They're all performing that same mystery
It's fantastic
I love it, I'm glad that you're
I'm glad that you're seeing it
I hope you can bring us some dirty stuff
Early Christians
I got lots of sources
I got lots of sources about
Some of their ritual stuff
There's Eucharist where semen is involved
Drinking semen
Good
You're going to see it
You're going to see it
I can't wait, I can't wait
I had you on, Neil
Because I wanted to ask you a couple of questions
Very specific questions
Number one, tell me
What is your
Estimation
Of academia, particularly
Bible scholars
And the
Investigation
Of antiquity
What do you
Think?
I'm glad you said specifically Bible studies
Because I've been
Saying this and I'll keep saying it
I think Bible scholars
Seminarian
Academia is like
Not even in minor leagues
Compared to the major leagues
That is classics
I wouldn't even say it's minor leagues
I'd say it's like high school
It's like
It's just junior varsity
No seriously though
That's called the bullshit
To get the best
Best New Testament
Scholar you can get
And their range of
History is just
They're not required
To do what classics are
Classes are supposed to do
And you can tell me
I'm just hearing this from
You and other classes
Who are just like
The current state of Bible studies
And Bible academia
New Testament scholarship
It's so pigeon-holed
It's so basic
Like biblical
You have to learn biblical Greek
Instead of actually
Getting into the attic
And the classical Greek
You just have to learn
You only have to learn the Greek that's in the Bible
That's it. There's a whole book on this
Like learning
Biblical Greek
You're literally just learning the vocab that's in the Bible
So you don't even know what these words are
Atomologies are
And just real quick before you
Comment on this
And then you hear
I don't want to say names
But there's a big Bible scholar out there
Who
Oftentimes
To explain some sort of
To explain something
In the New Testament
You can't explain what's going on in the New Testament
Without having the background of the culture
And the history before it
Christianity just spread up out of the ground
As a miracle
Without any influences
Everyone knows that, that's just common sense
Everything's like that
This person in particular
Starts
Giving an explanation of some of the
Diotic Wars between
Alexander's generals
And it's so bad
They're getting people's names wrong
Getting dates wrong
It's not even like
It's not even like
Associates degree level
Knowledge of this type of stuff
It's like
It looks like this person just found out
Five minutes ago from reading Wikipedia
And then extrapolated some stuff and wrote it down
And it's just like, whoa
And like, that's your ex-
This person was comparing
Seleucus
And how he was the son of God to like Jesus
I think that's what they were doing
And I
Not just remember just reading it
Because five years ago I would have read that
And be like, oh cool, I don't know nothing
Studying the history
The Hellenistic era
Diotic Wars, you know, the Antigonids
The Seleucids, the Ptolemy's
Leicimachus and like getting to know
What was going on in that time
What were these different cults like
What were they doing, what was the culture of the time
Period? And then I read something like this
And I'm like, now I know why
Now I know why classicists laugh
At the state of Bible scholars
Just saying
Yeah, yeah, amen
To that, which is a shame
Because they have those texts
But they
They don't really belong to them
Right, you have to look at it
And this is what troubles me
Because this is what impedes
Renaissance
Is when you take a group of people
And say we're going to control
The media surrounding these
This evidence
As soon as you do that, you get appropriation
Right, that's why you have people
Justifying terrible, terrible acts
Over
God told them to kill all the women
In village and that it was for the glory of
God
When you have a group of people teaching like that
You can
Guarantee yourself 100% of the time
You're not going to get an accurate
Look at that evidence
The evidence belongs to us
The New Testament belongs to us
It's a human document
Part of history
That's what's so crazy
About separating classical
Scholarship
Classical philology
From New Testament studies
Why are they separating those two?
This is part of the same
Classical philology world
That it was written in
So why are you separating it?
You don't take Homer
And just make it its own thing
And then separate it from the rest of the classical studies
Why would you do that?
You don't understand Homer without understanding
Hesiod or understanding
The stuff that happened before
How would you know?
You would just be focusing on Homer
You'd be so pigeonholed and blind
To understand what's going on
Exactly
And why is it you give just this material
To be guarded by these people
Who are not integrated into the rest?
I can tell you why
This is what I think
Because it began
The thing that was controlled by Christians
In scholarship
These very Christian
Universities
These Catholic universities
Dominated that space for so long
And it still affects the way it is today
Even today you get
You know, classical or
You know, PhD, New Testament scholars
That come out of a seminary
And they still have to sign a document
Saying that they believe in Jesus
Even if they don't, they'll just lie and sign it
Just to get their PhD
Why is that even there still?
Right, it's like
Why would you have a...
You couldn't see this in physics or chemistry
Can you imagine that?
You wouldn't take a great astrophysicist
And say, you know what?
All your work is great
Your math is straight on
Nice articles, nice books
But you gotta sign this statement
Because we only want you to present
This material a certain way
And that's why Julian is saying
This has to stop
And I don't think people realize, Neil
This is why I was so...
You know, this is what really gets my goat
Is when...
Can we bring up the goat now?
Put him on too, there he is
There he is, this is what really
Gets my goat
Is the fact that
This material is being
Essentially altered
To be presented to you
In a way that some
Group wants you
To understand it
Right? The reality
Is being fed to you
Through a lens, and all you gotta do
It's all you gotta do is
Shadow that lens
And stand back and look at the text
Look at the text and do what a
Scientist would do
Just do what a scientist would do
And look at the evidence
And say, what do these words mean
All of a sudden when you start doing that
The whole
Propaganda that started
With the early church
And I'm not talking about the freaks
Who were on drugs
I'm talking about the reformers
The church fathers who were trying
To put control
Trying to put that horse
A bridle on that horse, right?
Real quick, let me jump in and say something
About that, because the
Case that these so-called
Gnostics are trying to make
For themselves being the legit Christians
Was that they are
Doing exactly what Jesus and Paul
Are doing, they're getting their divine
Messages from the Holy Spirit
Through inspiration
That's correct, that's
Biblically correct
