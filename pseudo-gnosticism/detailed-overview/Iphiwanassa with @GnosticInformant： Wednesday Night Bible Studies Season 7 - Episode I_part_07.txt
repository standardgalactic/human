The herceologists
Or they call them proto-orthodox
I hate that word, there's no such thing
You're looking back and then
You're classifying them as orthodox
Because they won, so these
Proto-orthodox people
You know what they, Irenaeus
Actually says this
That authority
Only comes from a bishop
Because the bishop is the living god
On earth, where
That is so against the
Messages of Jesus that it's not even funny
The guy that's walking around talking
Shit to Pharisees and Sadducees
Because they're all obsessed with the law
And they're obsessed with authority
You think that makes you
That's, why would that be the case
But it, so it's like
How did someone with that message
Win out? Because it fits like a
Glove for a Roman imperial religion
You're not going to let some guys
That are taking, getting
Ecstatic, speaking in tugs, taking drugs
And getting the message from the Holy Spirit
In control of your cultural
Norms, you're going to have
Some guy well dressed
In his nice robes and he's got his
Well written books next to him
And he's, you know, he's got bishops
And all these different cities that he can
Like write to and set things up with
It's way easier to control, it's way more
The logistics of it
Makes way more sense
But for me personally
The idea that, oh, we're right
Because we have bishops
And bishops have authority
Because they're bishops
Over, oh, we're right because
We're getting the divine message from the Holy Spirit
Like, wow
Doesn't make a lot of sense to me, right?
Whether you like Christianity
Or not, this is beside the point
That has nothing to do with the video
What I'm doing is, I'm just saying
Within the Christian world, here's what we're looking at
You know what I mean?
Yeah, I totally get what you mean
And I know that that's why
Becadelli was doing
What he was doing, he was trying to break
Through that authority
And say, look, you know, we're
You know, you don't influence us
And he tried to
Write about the very heart
Of the mystery
And it was so much for that
Control structure that
They, they
Some, one gentleman
Said, people blamed
The Reformation
On the examination
Of the hermaphrodite
Seriously
Your mind is that small
Right?
I just can't believe it, Neil
We're going to be swallowed
If we're, let me finish
With this question for you
If, if we're
In a period
Following a Renaissance
That followed
Dark Ages
That followed the height
Of Roman civilization
If we're in a period that's following
That Renaissance and that
Enlightenment, do you think
Now in society
That we're going forward
Your backwards, are you going to
Where are you going to put us on the
Scale of, you know, progress
Towards classical
Civilization or
Turning away from it, where are we
Well
We're turning, I would say this
We're turning away from those dark
Ages of the church
In control of every facet of society
Even during Reformation
Days, it's like
Either you're a Lutheran or a Catholic
Or a Calvinist, or maybe you're living
England, you're an Anglican
And they control all facets of society
Coming into the Americas
And the French
Were contemporary with the Americans
On this, was the idea
That we need to get away from this
System and allow
You know, freedom of religion
Like that, so
Going, I think that, and that's reverting
Back to the classical age
Of the democracy of Greece
Of
Having your own personal mystery religions
Wherever you are, and not having
To answer to some
Top-down system
In some other city
So I would say moving forward in that sense
Is that what you meant?
Yeah, so do you think you just
Spark something in my brain
If what you're saying is right
We could be in a position
Where there could be
A
Reformation of the church itself
The church could assimilate
The new information that's coming
About itself
And it could change, it could form
Something new. I was thinking
We're just in a place of darkness
Where we're going to go back down
That path of the dark ages
Could be.
You know, think about
Not to get political, not to be political
But I have to say this
The dude who just got
Picked to be the house speaker
This guy is not just a Christian
Like every other person in the Senate is
Everyone in the Senate is a Christian
They're all Christians or
There's a couple of Jewish people in there
And then there's one person who
Considered himself an atheist, Andrew Yang
And the whole Congress
But these people aren't really
Have, they just say they are
They're not really like
They just say it. This guy
Is legitimately
Takes the world 6,000 years old
He thinks God created the world in seven days
He thinks Adam and Eve are literally real
Like this guy is legitimately
A fundamentalist Christian
And if you think about it
If the president dies, the vice president becomes president
If the vice president dies
He becomes president
He's the third most powerful person in the nation
So
Looking at something like that
Then I agree with you
Because it could go either way
Either we as a society
Go that way
In that direction because it's right there
For the taking on that side
What I'm saying about going towards
The principles that Greece
And
Greece and Rome laid out in the Republic
Days and Hellenistic air
Democritus
Demosthenes
Solon giving those laws
And stuff like that
That made civilization
Right?
There's like half of us in the world
That are trying to go in that direction
In the modern sense
Not just do exactly what they did
To have that same
Layout system
But you're right though
There's another half of this society
In another direction
You can see this because people are all over twitter
And they're always talking about
Look at this beautiful church
That was built in 1532
Why can't we build stuff like that anymore
We're so weak today in society
This is what they try to
So they are a strong force
In the culture
Of that type of thinking
So you're not wrong
I don't think you're wrong anymore than I think
I think you could go either way
We're at a fork in the road right now
Yeah
Notice that the guy is also that same guy
As part of this group
That is, you know, they're going to change
Education
They're going to change the way that we look at the world
Notice that they're all saying
The same thing
Christianity produced
Democracy
That our beloved nation is the product of
Excuse me
You could not be
More incorrect
And I know, Neil, that you've put up quotes
To try to yell at people and say
Look, it was
You'll hear people like Ben Shapiro
Will say like, you know
The Constitution is a Judeo-Christian document
Yeah
Really?
It's so bizarre
Because everything you find in the Constitution
You can find
In pre-Christian
Greece
In the laws of Solon, for example
In the laws of the orations
Of Demosthenes
I just mentioned both of them
But even Roman Republic
Constitutions were
Given by the goddess
Yeah
This was understood by everybody
The goddess, whether it's Athena or Minerva
The goddess with the helmet
And the shield and the spear
She is the symbol of the Constitution
Because what the Constitution does
Is it's a divine thing
In this sense
Why is it a divine thing? What do you mean? Is it magic?
Well, here's what it does
Everybody, whether you have a better
Abilities and capabilities of someone else or not
Under this Constitution
This person that you can have
That you can easily
Out
You can easily outdo somebody
Because of your wealth, because of you have
