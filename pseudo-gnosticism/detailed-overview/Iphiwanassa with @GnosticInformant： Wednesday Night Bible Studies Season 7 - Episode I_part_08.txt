You have access to an army
You control the grain, whatever you are
You're a senator, high up somewhere
And that person is just a plebian
But the Constitution puts up stuff
That protects this person
With their rights
So that you are bound
By the same
Powers, basically
That's what the Constitution does
It's power
It sets up a system where people have protections
Right?
That's the thing that is so important
And I just want to say one more thing
About Judeo-Christianity having
Some sort of claim to this
Because I can see
Why they would say this, but that's wrong
But here's the thing
So we were talking about how
Septuagint
And the Pentateuch was created
In Alexandria
Around 300, 270 BCE
Right?
Well, one of the questions I get from
People who are skeptic of this theory
Will say why?
Why do they care about creating
A Bible for
People in Israel?
Why wouldn't they just write the...
It's a decent question on the face
But it's really simple, once you look at the situation
This is why I talk about the Diodechi
Knowing the history
Knowing what was going on in the world this time
Is so important
Because if you look at the sources
Right around 300, 312, 320 BCE
There's a giant war
Over Israel
And the son of Antigonus
Demetrius
And they fought literally
In Gaza
There's a thousand wars that happened
In Gaza throughout history
This was one of them
And Ptolemy
I just told this story there
I'll tell it to you, it's such a great story
Plutarch tells it the best
He says that
Young Demetrius
So Demetrius' father is
One-Eyed, famous general
Who served under Alexander the Great
And Alexander the Great's father
What's his name?
Philip
So this guy is an OG
He has one eye from war
His son is Demetrius
Now Antigonus is still alive during this time
But he's controlling Greece
He's controlling Macedonia
He sends his son Demetrius to go fight Ptolemy
Ptolemy also fought
Under Alexander the Great
Side by side with this guy's father
So they have a bond
They're like brothers
He's sending his son to go fight one of his brothers
So he goes down
And they find each other in Gaza
And Ptolemy sets up his army
And Demetrius sets up his army
And they fight
Ptolemy destroys them
Absolutely annihilates this whole army
Takes all of his fleets
In the Mediterranean Sea
Takes all of his golden chests that he had
Because you have to
You need funds, right?
Takes everything, all of his tents
All of his horses
All of everything, gone
And now Demetrius is on his knees
Expecting to be executed right then and there
Ptolemy walks up to him
Yeah, you did good, kid
That was good for a first fight
Here
Here's all your chests back
Here's all of your fleets back
You get out of my land
I own this land now
I'm taking all these Jews here
This is the reason why I tell this story
I'm taking all these Jews here
They're my slaves, not yours
Go back and tell your father you lost
Come back in about a year when you get better
And we'll fight again
Which does happen, by the way
But anyways, the reason why I told that story
Is because now Ptolemy controls Israel
He takes hundreds of thousands of slaves
From Israel
To Alexandria, Egypt
About two decades later
Is when this Septuagint
Pentateuch gets created
Now, the question of
Why would they do this
Well, if you can't see it now
I don't know what to tell you because
When you control a land
You have to set up laws
That are
In line with what your ideology is
Ptolemy had all the incentives
In the world
To set up
A mythology
A history
And a set of laws
To govern Israel
He does this, by the way
Russell Gamerkin from Copenhagen Seminar
International
Writes a whole book about this
Showing that 95% of the laws
In Deuteronomy, Numbers and Exodus
Are from Solon
Solon
And Lycurgis
5% of them are found in Babylonian
Laws
So what they did was
They took all the cultural norms
And legends about Abraham and Moses
And all these people
They rewrote these stories
But they inserted new laws
That would be
A beneficial to the state of the Ptolemaic
Empire
And then guess what happened
They let all those slaves go back to Israel
With their new set of laws
And geopolitics
That's what happens in the world right now
When you conquer a new land
You set up a new government
You put a new constitution there
This is normal
Stuff that happens all the time
So that's your answer to why would they do this
Of course they would do this
Why wouldn't they do this
They control that land
Brilliant
Brilliant, did you notice
I want everybody in the audience
To notice
The precise use
Of the sources
Neil is just reading sources
Right, and he's just taking
Material from sources
That's all, he didn't think this up
He didn't sit around and right
He realized it when he's putting the evidence together
So that he can make a case
Like the academic should be doing
But don't
Because he's operating outside
Think about what Neil just said
If that's true
Judaism is an invention
Of the third century
And further down
An invention
Think about what that does
Think about what that does
To this very time in space
Just to say that
Will cause commotion
Right, you're not going to be popular
For saying that kind of thing
Neil, you're standing with the sources
And because of that I will stand
Next to you
There's peer review material on it
Making this up out of thin air
Other people that came to the same conclusion
I didn't even know this
I came to this conclusion on my own
Work, and I found out that other people
Through peer review, through actual academic
Regular study have come to this
Exact same conclusion as me
And
What was I going to say
Yeah, it's
And that's the reason why I was saying that
People say Judeo-Christianity
Are the laws that are
From the Constitution, it's like
No, this is standard constitutional
Republic that are
Set up by ancient classical
Greece thinkers
Like Solon
The very idea that the slave
Religion of Christianity
Could have produced
Democracy
Is a joke
It's why Stelsis is standing there
Saying your slave religion sucks
Right?
It's going to destroy our society
Christians
If I can make an appeal to the evangelicals
This will end up with two appeals
I'll do mine, you do yours Neil
And we'll call it a night
My appeal is to the evangelicals out there
You think what you're doing
Is bringing America
You think you're bringing
Freedom, you're not
You're bringing your own chains
You're taking the democracy
That was built
By people who went to those
Classical sources
For their inspiration and said
Oh, democracy, Athenian invention
Sounds good, let's try it here in America
You're taking those people's
Work and you're destroying it
So that you can be enslaved
Enslaved to
A theocratic
Orange monster
That's what you're doing
Morons
It's you people
Who will drag down this country
And I'm not the one who said it
Thomas Jefferson said
The greatest threat
To the fledgling American democracy
Is the Christian church
Right
Hadn't been a lot of other
You know
Constitutional fathers
Whatever you call them
A lot of them were saying this stuff
