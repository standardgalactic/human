Eywa, we all shouted.
Oh, thank you.
Thank you Lucifer, bringer of dawn, thank you.
Thank you for opening our eyes.
We children of Eywa.
Oh God, I love this.
You know what, we're on the way of Cain.
We're on the way of Cain.
Now, for those of you who pretend to read your Bibles,
catch up, go to Jude, look at it, see what it says.
In Greek, don't do it in English,
because it's garbage.
It's totally garbage.
I was, for this translation today, oh my God.
And they all copied each other, right?
The early ones hit it, if King James does it,
everybody else falls in the same pit.
That's how bad biblical scholars are.
Do you know who should be translating?
Needless to tell you this.
You know who should be translating?
The Bible, classical philologist, baby.
Classical philology, you can trust us to translate Homer.
You can trust us to translate Sophocles.
You can trust us to translate a Byzantine dude
like John Tzitzis.
Ah, yeah, that's a sexy name, Tzitzis.
Show me your Tzitzis.
I've got a whole book he wrote.
I've got a whole book he wrote.
That's right.
Okay, I can feel it.
Can you feel that?
I feel it somewhere.
I don't wanna show us, but I feel it somewhere.
Let's go, hit the next one.
Right, before they recover.
Here it is, people.
Right, oh, God, where's this hyma?
Right, it's the hyma, what, wait, what?
There's some prophets and some holy people in this, 1824.
And what happened to them?
Their hyma is in her.
It's in her, yeah, just wait.
Wait, shh, it's in her, the blood.
And what's gonna happen?
The blood of all those who were slaughtered.
That's also, all of great Gaia, right?
You forgot, we're back with Uranus and Gaia, right?
Their offspring, right, and that's where we are.
With them, can you feel them?
Look around, you've thrown.
Look at all the dead people that we've resurrected.
Is he gonna get to the resurrection?
Watch, just wait, Jesus will come in.
He's not mad yet, he gets really mad, though.
Watch what Jesus does when he gets angry, it's kinda scary.
Here it is, 19-1, after these things I heard.
It was this great voice that sounded like
a whole crowd of people.
What are they doing?
They're screaming out of Uranus.
Do you see where we are?
They're screaming out of Uranus.
What are they saying?
Alleluia, alleluia, alleluia.
Do you know what it's like when 1,000 people
from up there scream into your head?
Alleluia, mmm, are we smelling Bacchus?
Cause we're getting close, do you wanna see it?
Do you wanna see it, Dan?
Dan, do you wanna see it?
Let's go, let's do it.
Dan's like, oh, I can't really read Greek,
so this makes sense, right?
Okay, what is coming, people?
Look at the last two lines of that.
Hey, sotiria, the salvation, our salvation.
What is the day today and why did I bother you
and screw up your schedule
and change things from Friday to Saturday?
Because today is the day, March 30th is the day
that great time when we commemorate
the health and the vigor of Rome.
Yes, the health and the vigor of Roma.
Now, I didn't say her sacred name,
but I will continue to leave it in the ether
for those of you who have ears to hear,
you'll pick it up.
And when you receive the name, you won't have to ask me.
You won't have to ask me, cause you'll know it.
Isn't that nice?
That's how it works.
You thought it was come to me and ask me
and just get it enough times and you'll get it.
Nope, it's an experience, the name.
That name written on Jesus' thigh,
lift up Jesus' skirt really quick.
You know, I mean, rub your hand on Jesus' thigh
and for those of you, look, sister is a frustration.
Now would be a good time for you to maybe leave the room.
I know, I know that you are able to come to a place.
Yeah, well, enough said.
Look at the thigh of Jesus
and what's that stuff that's written on it?
What's all that?
That's a power that is harnessed in magic
because what is magic people?
Whole Satanic congregation just raised their hand.
Logos, baby.
That's right, power the logos.
The power of the logos.
This is that logos.
Let's see the next one, bring it up.
Oh God, this is giving me,
this stuff gives me chills to see the physics
behind it gives me chills.
Okay, this is Apocalypse 19 too.
Then he says, because what, what?
His judgments, you know what I mean?
They're all, they're all true, right?
They're all just and what did he do?
What did Yahoo do?
Oh, we're talking about Yahoo.
What did Yahoo do?
He's the one who killed.
Babylon.
He's the one who killed her.
And why would he do such a thing?
Remember, it's because of her drugs.
Yeah, it's because of her drugs.
And that's what it says.
It says, she's the great porne.
What is a porne?
A porne is a woman who works in a temple.
And she does, she performs acts that are,
you could say are somewhere between
a nice music festival
and a medical surgery.
That's what she does for you.
Yeah, that's a porne.
Yeah.
These are the women with whom you won't associate.
You can't.
These are the first women to lose it
because they're right on the front.
When Christianity came after paganism,
when it came after the Republic,
when it pulled down the government around them
and found some slimy SOB named Constantine
to support their political cause.
When they did that and started burning everything,
you know, that's when the, you know,
that Yahoo is in judgment
because that's what Yahoo does, right?
We're gonna watch it.
Watch what Yahoo does.
Okay, now look away from Jesus' thigh for a minute.
Let's pull back, go, go.
Boom, go ahead.
Yeah, this is what everybody's been caught in.
What are all the drugs?
Okay, seriously people.
This is what God hates.
Are you ready?
This is the moral of the universe right here.
What is she being punished for?
This woman that we just called a prostitute.
What is she?
It's her porneia.
You got caught up in her porneia.
You know those 70 virgins that you're gonna get
when you go to Valhalla?
Does it matter?
He's mixing his religions, does it matter?
You're not gonna be able to have sex with him.
Yeah, no, that's the punishment, right?
Fantastic, and some of them are ones
that you threw acid into their faces.
Yeah, so good luck with that.
Yeah, isn't that amazing?
You didn't think the virgins were important, did you?
Of course they are.
Look, it's all in the history.
That's what we gotta look at.
Go, it's the porneia, it's her porneia.
It's her sexuality that Jova doesn't like, right?
Remember, step one, smash the babies against the rocks.
Let their heads explode.
You ever see Satan doing that?
You ever see Satan, we're about to see
what Jesus is wearing.
You're never gonna catch Satan doing this kind of stuff,
ever, ever.
Yeah, interesting, interesting.
Maybe things are backwards.
Maybe things are backwards.
Do you know the first person to think that?
Let's go, next one, next one.
Oh, look at this, look at this.
Yeah, and then what happened, right?
Heard him shout out again.
Remember, we're all sitting there in our state
and we're hearing the voices from Uranus.
Jesus did the same thing.
Made him go into the desert to visit the devil, right?
So you know where we are in the quantum map, right?
Everybody, I assume, is mapping this all out.
You got it in your head, you know?
Okay, good.
Fantastic, I heard another.
Alleluia.
And what was it?
This great smoke came out.
Came up just drifting up.
Where does this smoke go from Babylon?
Where does it go?
It goes into the ion.
He doesn't say it goes up and into the atmosphere.
He doesn't say it goes up and disappears in the sky.
Now, Uranus didn't swallow it up.
Now, he says, what does he say?
I want him to see the exact words, Chewie.
Boom.
It goes up into the ion.
Into the ions, yes, the ions, pearl of ions.
Okay, remember, what is the ion?
It is that shell that is around time.
It contains time.
Yes, but at the same time, it is outside of time.
Okay, so imagine the plurality of the ions.
That's what Pythagoras teaches.
He teaches that there are 360 of these.
360.
Some kind of geometry.
That guy was a freak for geometry.
I don't know, I don't know what he was doing.
Let's go to the next one.
Let's go to the next one.
And so what happens?
It's time, everybody, to get up and be happy, right?
Make happy, right?
Be agolic, right?
Be happy and do what?
Give him some glory.
A shout out, everybody,
because what's coming, says this text.
What's coming is the gammas of the arnillo.
Is the what?
Is the marriage of the fleece.
You didn't think we were making this stuff up fresh, did you?
Jesus is in the first Christ.
The first Christ creates the marriage of the fleece.
What do they do?
It's an actual operation.
We have it.
Some of our greatest minds from antiquity
recorded the operation.
It's a religious operation.
Yes.
You mean, beh.
No, sorry.
And you know what's funny is the Christians always got this
when you see like the marriage
and then try to symbolize there's a sheep.
What's the symbol?
No, it's the fleece.
And it was a process that was started by the first Christ,
the Medwa, the divine physician.
Yeah, late Bronze Age, right?
