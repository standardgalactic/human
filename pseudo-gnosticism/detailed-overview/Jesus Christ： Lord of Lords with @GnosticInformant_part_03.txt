And so good.
You know what's on that fleece?
That fleece is guarded by a dragon
and on it is her song.
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that gorgeous?
For you Christians tonight,
you walk into your churches tomorrow.
I know, I know you're gonna walk in there.
First thing you're gonna see is this giant dude
going through capital punishment.
That must not be a good start for the day.
Then they're gonna shove something in you
after they take something away from you.
They'll pass around a little potty
for you to your wallets to pee into.
I know you'll go and you can go tomorrow
for the first time having read the Bible.
I love it.
You see what kind of service I do
to the Christian community.
Do you see?
This is marvelous.
Give me the next one.
You know, I've got a couple of students, by the way,
who can read better than there.
Anyway, go ahead.
And I saw that heaven, that uranon.
I saw it opened up.
Okay, here we are.
The pharmaquia has kicked in, right?
And what do we see in just like Jesus
when he's with John, the Baptist, right?
And the water, right?
What does he see?
He sees that uranos open.
Here it comes.
And what comes out?
Oh God, are you ready?
Here's the portal people.
And evangelicals start salivating.
I saw a white horse.
And I saw the one sitting upon it.
And he's called Pistos Cae Alethinos.
He's called trustworthy and true.
And in righteousness, he judges
and he takes us all to war.
Oh God, this is a new Jesus.
I didn't see this Jesus coming.
I thought he was all like crucified.
I thought he was all wigged out
on whatever it was that he OD'd on.
That's what I thought.
He's yelling, I'm not a child trafficker.
I think he thought he was gonna go up
on some kind of Rico charges or something.
I don't know.
But the fact is, you know, he's dead.
Not here, right?
Right, not here.
Not here.
And this is what we all look for.
I know you do.
Those of you who love Jesus,
I know you're looking for this.
I know you're looking for this.
And Satanic congregation,
this is what you should be giving to people.
They wanna see Jesus.
Give them Jesus.
Let's see Jesus.
Let's see Jesus.
Go to that.
Here, look, Bible scholars can't do this.
Watch that.
What about Jesus?
What's going on with Jesus?
Well, his eyes are the flocks puros.
They have what?
They have the flocks puros.
They have the flocks puros.
That's a technical term.
What is that flocks?
You know what that flocks is?
It is that brilliance that you get
when the lightning strikes.
It is that silvery brilliance that hits right away.
Boom.
It's the first wave.
Boom, and you get the lightning, right?
Oh, God.
Oh, God, it takes forever for the thunder.
But that first brilliance, that is the flocks.
And you only get that when you've been Christed,
when you've been Christed,
when you have had that burning purple put into your eyes,
when your eyes are opened and you have the fruit.
Yeah.
Do you know what revealing the mystery does?
This is what they said in antiquity.
Revealing the mystery brings the lightning.
Yeah.
It makes the Christ.
Love it, love it, love it.
People were just asking me.
So Christ is a word that is a pharmaceutical term?
Yes, oh my God.
Why didn't you know that, Dan?
Why didn't you know that, Kip?
Why didn't you guys know that?
The people who are getting millions,
hundreds of thousands and millions of views
for their esoteric investigations.
Here you go, people.
You didn't know that because you don't work with the original.
It's obvious.
You can watch your garbage and say,
this is kind of laughable.
That's why classes don't mess around with the Bible.
That's why they don't.
Because it's this group of people who are laughably bad.
Who have assumed guardianship.
It's time for us people.
Devil told me, he was like, look at them.
There's a couple of things we can do.
I was like, okay, give me the options.
He said, you can either kick down that door
and take that book back.
Or you can let this corruption feed the wrath
that I'll take out on you for dishonoring the muse.
Cause it's his daughter.
You know what I mean?
I just, I don't mean to jump to the conclusion,
but it's kind of important to him, right?
That whole eye-opening thing and everything.
So I was like, fine, we'll take back the book.
Here's the book.
Let's show them the book.
Give me more Jesus, please.
Please, more Jesus.
This is to shock and nauseate you.
Yes, I love those pictures.
Love them.
Love them.
That one I didn't, flocks, pull it off.
Here it is.
Next one.
This I just wanted you to see.
Look at people, relish it a little bit.
Put your hands on this word.
Reach out, look at that first letter.
Oh, look at that fee.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Seminarians will say five,
but that's because, you know, they want foe and thumb.
Flocks, look at the flocks.
Look at that C.
That thing is bumpy too.
It's curvy, curvaceous, pull-offs.
Listen to that.
Pull-offs.
Love it.
Love it.
You can see it this time.
Greek is losing its musicality.
Yeah, it is.
It is.
You'd never see this particular combination.
You know what I mean?
In an eschelian chorus.
My God, man.
Keep going.
Keep going.
Dan, suck it.
Let's go.
All right.
Look at this.
What is he dressed in?
What's Jesus dressed in now?
For by the way, and I learned that the prophet Jesus
is more spoken of in the Quran than any other prophet,
any other prophet.
So here he is, everybody that respects Jesus.
Let's see.
Let's see what Jesus is wearing.
Cover up his wonderful thigh with that tattoo.
And let's look at what he's wearing.
What is he wrapped in?
He's wrapped in a Himmation
that is bevamin on Haimati.
That's what?
That is dyed in blood.
Died in blood.
Now, wait a minute.
This is not splashed in blood.
This is intentional.
This is taking a garment
and dying it.
Making sure it's baptized, thoroughly baptized.
Yeah, bring that dye out.
What is it that they're using?
Pray tell Jesus, what's on your threads, gangsta G?
It's blood.
It's blood.
It's blood.
What do you think all those children were for?
Right?
Remember what the muse of the Vatican said,
the Vatican prophetess.
Remember what she said.
This is all.
Analogia.
Analogia.
That is what this is.
That is what is bringing you the quantum reality.
Good, good.
You hear it?
Oh, God.
Okay, I'm getting excited
because this starts to get really good.
Give me the next one.
Whatever the next one was, just feed it to me.
I've lost, oh, oh, here it is.
Okay, look, look, look, look, look.
Oh, you gotta give it to me quick.
What?
So Jesus has his threads that are staying with blood, right?
And what is he gonna do when he comes back?
What is he gonna do when this is him?
Tell us, Jesus, what's the night out on the town gonna be?
He says, I'm gonna open my mouth
and I'm gonna kill with my tongue.
Oh, oh, there's my superhero.
There is my superhero.
This guy's power, a sword comes out of his mouth
right through your chest.
It's his voice, he kills with his voice, yeah.
Yeah, what do you think that thing's already covered
with blood for?
Because, you know, when you're out and you get spattered,
you know, it's not a cool look.
You know, this is Jesus we're talking about.
This is Jesus.
Now remember, 30% of your population follows this Jesus.
Yeah, and they've picked their prophet, orange Jesus.
They picked their prophet and you have them.
Tom said you should sacrifice him to the tree of liberty.
But if you won't listen to Tom,
you don't deserve your democracy
because Tom was pulling it right out
of those classical sources.
Fantastic, the same ones that we use
to be able to read these texts.
That's what I'm bringing to you, that benefit.
So listen to this, it's to be loyal.
It's a good old fashioned Tom, love it, love it.
This is fantastic, I'm privileged, I told you.
This is my greatest privilege.
Yep, let's give them, give them what they want.
Oh, that was down there at the bottom.
We need the text before that, text before that.
Yeah, and look what he says at the bottom.
What does he call himself here at the bottom?
Look at the last line, Panto Kratos, right?
He's the, oh, and oh, God, I almost didn't say it.
He says he's gonna shepherd the people
and how's he gonna do it?
He's gonna do it with an iron robdon.
Now, you don't know what a robdon is,
