as beast, is beast, right?
Now, you and I have been studying Theriacs
and we're gonna see a Theriac come out
out of the Herculaneum Library, right?
You and I have been looking at these Theriacs
and we know, we know what that Therion is.
They're calling it a beast, but you and I speak
and we know that the throne,
we know what the throne really is, right?
And we know what the beast really is.
But it's more than that.
This is not just Orphic Vox here that's working.
It's more a technical use of the term.
The Therion is a technical use of the term, right?
What is a Therion, right?
What is that Theriac?
You gotta start reading the Greek priests, right?
The Roman physicians who are writing
about these compound formulas and what they're doing, right?
So what does this line say?
Look, the verb is epiosthe.
The Therion is uncovered.
The Therion is discovered.
It doesn't say something about a brrr.
It says at this time, the Theriac is uncovered.
Look at the next, just so they can see it,
straight out of the Victorians.
Something that is determined, right?
The Theriac is unveiled.
Yeah, isn't that nice?
Because once we have the Theriac, we've got the beast.
And what does the beast hold up?
As you all know in St. Danick congregation,
she who has the cup.
Yeah, fantastic.
You cannot take these compound poisons of communion
that allow you to enter death
unless you also have a Theriac with it,
unless you're carried by the beast.
That's how it works.
Look, here, here at Amonkor,
we're going to send you there and back.
You are explorers.
You're going to go there.
And where is there?
There is beyond the dark star.
You'll come back and you'll fill us in.
You'll then know what is beyond.
And you won't fear death anymore.
Yeah, isn't that nice?
It's a side effect of this whole process.
So welcome to Amonkor.
Yes, fantastic.
Flights are departing.
Yes, fantastic.
Let's go. Next one.
Look, let's blow them.
Just blow it, Chewie.
We need the big explosives here.
Look at this.
Oh, yeah, wow.
The charagma.
What is the charagma?
Yeah, it's that thing that's punched into our skin.
You mean these people are into this?
Yes, okay.
The tattooing is there for a reason.
Why? Because he is the logos.
He is the logos.
Everybody runs around and Mark of the Beast.
Mark of the Beast.
Did you know Moses was handing out the Mark of the Beast?
And by the way, Moses, the oldest word for muse,
is mew omega sigma, Mosos.
It's the same word as Moses, right?
It's the same word as Moses.
And Moses, we all have the char...
Look, I want to correct.
I want to show you something that is fake tonight,
and a real part of your reality, but it's fake.
Moses, trying to help the people who are getting bitten
by the snakes.
What's the thing that you got to do for their health?
You got to make an image of a serpent, a bronze serpent,
and you're going to have to put it on a pole and hold it up.
When everybody looks at it, magical, magical,
they're going to be healed.
Now, for those of you who believe that's possible,
I've got salvation to sell you.
Yeah, but what's the reality anthropologically?
It doesn't say that.
That bronze serpent, it says you put it into a tattoo
so that the person can look at it and be reassured
that their medicine is working.
Jesus, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ.
Do you see how it is when you follow the fairy tale?
You don't know it.
Look at my arm.
You know what's written on that?
You have no idea who you are.
You have no idea.
Yeah, but it's OK.
It's OK because that awakening, that self-knowledge,
that's better than any sort of doctrine or dogma
or list of things to do while you watch some dude hang there.
Yeah, it's more powerful.
It's love, baby.
You don't need a credit card for this stuff.
Let's go.
Next one, let's be almost done because we
have to bring in Gnostic.
He's like, hurry the hell up.
Yeah, so this is just the, I just
wanted you to see the, everybody else gets killed.
End of story, right?
Jesus with his mouth deaf, right?
Imagine that.
Imagine, hey, everybody out there doing all the movies,
Marvel and all that kind of stuff, make this superhero.
Make it every time he opens his mouth,
a giant sword comes out and stabs you through the chest
or through the face or through the neck, right?
This is Mr. Blood.
He got to cover him with blood because it's, you know,
he's going to get covered with it, doing this kind of stuff.
Just out it comes.
That's the God that you people follow.
The watchers are watching and they're like, what?
Are you kidding me?
Dang.
Yeah, there's no great mother here, definitely.
Definitely, great mother wouldn't let that happen.
She'd be like, cut that out, kid.
All right, go to the next one.
And look, look, look, look.
I just want you guys to know that there's hope
because Satan will be released, this says.
Yeah, his time is going to come up
and he's going to be released.
He's going to be released.
Fantastic.
Who would do such a thing?
I bet God could be convinced to do that.
You know what I mean?
It's like, dude, you messed up the garden.
Why not go for it again?
Let's go, let's go.
What happens?
The devil is the one who causes them to wander.
Look at that, that word that is four and five and plan on.
Right?
Oh, get your participles out, right?
Oh God, this is lovely.
What is somebody doing who's plan on?
They're wandering.
They're wandering.
So when the daughters go out to celebrate Bakas
and daddy says, hey, wise guy,
my girls went out to celebrate Bakas
and they are still nuts.
They are still nuts and what are they doing, dad?
They're wandering up in the mountains.
They're like breastfeeding animals,
making like choruses and lots of singing going on,
stuff like that, but they're wandering.
They're outside.
You know who made this?
You know who the author of this wandering is?
In your own texts,
Satan, the Saturnian Bakic religion
was started in the Bronze Age.
And by this time that these texts are there,
it's the core.
Dan, I'm sorry, but the plain fact of the matter is
Christianity is pagan mystery.
Yeah, yeah.
It's a corruption, Dan.
Your religion, whether you're a Protestant or a Catholic
or a Mormon or who else?
Joe was witnesses.
They're offshoots.
Your religion is from a God who was arrested
in a public park with a naked boy.
That's the anthropological reality.
Let's go to the next one.
And he was doing pagan stuff.
He was doing pagan stuff with that naked kid.
Sorry, but that's the historical reality.
Okay.
And so here's the devil and he's causing them to wander,
but look what happens.
You know where the devil goes?
The devil goes to the Limne in Tupuros, Caithiu.
Where does he go?
He goes to that container,
to that container of fire and sulfur, fire and sulfur.
Now, why would you say such a thing?
All of you who've been watching and dedicating your time
for so long recognize now what that sulfur is.
He's talking about a purification.
What are we gonna find in that container of fire?
Are you gonna find the devil in there?
You're gonna find Saturn.
Yeah.
And what else?
What else?
Give me the text again.
What else are we gonna find?
Oh, God.
In addition to that sulfur, that puritive sulfur,
this is where the text says that ferriac
and the pseudo-profit are tried.
Yes, that's where they operate.
You wanna be the pseudo-profit?
Isidore, shut up.
That was saying Isidore's buttocks.
And I'm whipping him because he said
the Antichrist is ominous.
Yeah, you dirty old man.
Let's go to the next one.
This is who we're talking about.
Where is he?
He's in that container of fire.
You can, I can guarantee you what's in his eyes.
Oh, love it.
Okay, let's keep going.
Do you think we would get to him?
Here he is.
Here he is, people.
Is this a Hebrew word?
No, it's not.
It's not.
Not at all, people.
It's a perfectly nice Greek word.
Just like Jerusalem is.
I'm gonna give you a gift tonight.
Satanic congregation, this is for you.
This is our toy in our cereal box.
They used to do that.
This is our toy.
Are you ready?
Jerusalem.
What does Jerusalem mean?
It's a Greek word.
It's based on two roots.
And it means holy-minded.
Holy-minded.
Isn't that a pretty name for a city?
I wanna go to the place called holy-minded.
Yeah.
The stuff that comes later,
the stuff that comes after developed by rabbis,
that tradition, etymologically, is bull.
It's terrible, right?
Their own etymologies.
And they'll scratch their head.
Maybe it's their mech.
Well, maybe it's Shugal's a gaze way over in Samaria.
Maybe he came up with it.
They're geniuses.
No, I don't know, people.
It's calcolithic, right?
Oh, God.
Why did they not think about this?
Thank you to the archeologists from Tel Aviv
who will say openly that there's no,
there's no evidence to support any of this.
Yeah, it's a fairy tale that was invented
in the third century.
Isn't that amazing?
