It's a band of boys.
It's a band of boys.
Peter, I'll make you a fisherman of men.
Yeah.
Fishermen of men.
Right.
What does notice do with the fishermen of men?
And remember, notice is privy to the cult.
So for him, this is just more like history than, than any sort of paraphrase or metabolite.
Any who, um, here he is.
And he says, one of these people, what are they doing here?
Yeah.
Let's go back to the text one more time, one more time.
Glorious image.
Love it.
Let's go.
Yeah.
And what does he say here?
He says he's the fisherman of those, those, that band of boys.
And he says, certainly great king.
Right.
You know my heart.
You know my heart.
You know yourself how I gave you, I provided for you that sweet unspeakable love.
Okay.
Keep going down.
Let's go to another one.
Look at this.
I just want you to see it.
Simon is the, is the hunter fisherman.
Fisherman of that boy band.
The boy band.
Yeah.
We know they did it in Sparta too.
Right.
The boy band.
This is what Peter is.
Yep.
Why do you think they called them.
Mathetes students.
Do you think bearded old men walked around as students?
No.
They didn't.
These are the people who are just above the age of the pedagogue, that lower education.
We'd say that primary education level.
These are boys immediately pre and post puberty.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Let's see what the official titles are.
What these boys are doing.
Give me the next one.
Sure.
If you can.
Fantastic.
I just want you to see.
Here's the homozygous.
Yeah.
We know this.
It's the companions.
The Heteron.
Those are his public prostitute friends.
Keep going.
Yep.
Oh, and this is a good one.
Yeah.
What would you rather do?
He says, he asked Peter.
He says, I got pods.
Do you love all of those Sumige on Heteron, all of those prostitute boys.
That are Sumige.
What is Sumige on?
What is Sumige on?
All right.
Look at this.
Something that is Sumingis is what?
What does that say?
Mixed up together.
Coming.
Promiscuous.
Those promiscuous little boys.
Yeah.
They're apostles.
All of them.
Now you understand why you have to become as a child.
In order to enter the kingdom of heaven.
And remember, the kingdom of heaven also makes eunuchs.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Before tonight, my entire audience, I'll just take a second.
Before tonight, you thought it was just the naked boy that was in the garden with them
when he was rested.
You didn't realize those three apostles who were standing at a distance.
You didn't, you didn't realize that they were children too, did you?
Yeah, you didn't.
You got to become like a child if you want to follow Jesus.
Yeah.
Don't scandalize.
Whatever you do, Jesus says.
Do not scandalize me.
Okay, we got him, people.
It's all here.
It's, you know, there's, there's no way a jury can get this information and not, not
finding just over the top guilty of 104 different cosmic felonies.
It's fantastic.
Next one, please.
Take a look at this guys.
Oh, so Jesus shows up.
There was a couple of passages here.
We didn't skip anything.
I don't think the boom, boom, boom.
No.
Okay.
So there's a couple of passages that set this up, but here's Jesus, you know, he's
standing there next to the shore.
Peter goes out fishing.
He's like, I'm going fishing.
The boys are like, let's go.
Right.
And they're going with you with, with Peter and they get on a ship.
But it says they didn't catch anything.
They didn't catch any fish.
And the next morning, Peter wakes up on the boat naked.
Peter, you drugged out sex fame.
I feel sorry for you that he did what he did to you, Peter.
We got to get Peter to flip and give a confession.
That's all there is to it.
He's got to let people know exactly where Jesus touched him.
Yeah, exactly what he did to him.
Did he do what he did to that boy in the garden?
Did he even, did he do that and wrap that and use that medicine and you ended up three
days later wondering what felt so funny about your body?
Huh.
Interesting.
Peter, you got to tell us, take us back to the sources.
Let's hit people with a few more sources.
Right.
You got no response tonight.
The critics got no response tonight.
They can't.
How can they stand against this stuff?
The very next one.
Yeah.
And so, oh, here it is people.
Here's the lawyer's point, right?
