Paidea.
You know what that is?
That's the plural of the diminutive.
Again, my little, a diminutive for child, my little boys, my little child.
Come here, my children.
Come here.
Yeah.
Let him come unto me.
And they start yelling, hey, we don't like the way he's touching them.
And by touch, they meant molest.
We don't like the way he's aggressively molesting the children.
Don't scandalize me, says Jesus.
Don't scandalize me.
And you build churches and crosses to this guy.
You read books that are written by morons who praise this guy.
Yeah.
You study science that these morons contradict.
And you still give them room.
You still give them room while they destroy your civilization.
Do you wonder why the watchers think we're a bunch of morons?
Do you wonder?
Those are the lost boys.
Your reality now is that the apostles were a bunch of abused children.
And your world is made up of people who prop that garbage up.
Who just bring you down with the hall and the hall.
And you just shell them out.
You pay them all your bucks.
All your bucks go to these people.
And you are supporting an organization that was started by a child trafficker.
You want to save the children?
You morons?
You fools.
You want to save the children?
The guy that you snuggled with.
He was snuggling children.
Yeah.
Isn't that ironic?
What a twist.
What a twist in evangelical world.
What a twist.
Your God is the one who is the rapist of children.
The thing that you run around saying,
Yeah, we're going to save the children.
We're going to rip down this society and save the children just like we did in the first century.
And we just watch it happen.
Right?
It's all they're supposed to do.
The watchers anyway.
I'm going to read to you a little bit of Celsus.
Just for the sake of the Celsus, please.
I just want to quote Celsus, can you come here?
And some people call him Celsus.
That's fine.
I've heard medieval, people who do medieval Latin.
I've heard them say Celsus.
But you know, Celsus, there was a physician named Celsus too.
Good Roman physician.
Wrote a lot about drugs.
Let's see what Celsus says.
The honor the Christians pay to Jesus is no different from the sort paid to Hadrian's favorite boy, Antinois.
The honor they pay to Jesus is the same as the cult of Antinois.
Do you know who Antinois was?
He was Hadrian's naked boy.
Hadrian wasn't arrested in the public park at 4 a.m. like Jesus was.
But he had his boys like Jesus did.
And you know, he had one that he had a certain special affinity for.
And you know, it's the way it was.
It's the way it was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
This is how the Christians worship, says Celsus.
They're worshiping in the same rights as the boy loving rights of Antinois.
Didn't she like your wife, Hadrian?
Shut up.
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize that was a sensitive issue.
We don't have it recorded anywhere, Hadrian, that you ever expressed an interest in women.
But we know that you and Antinois, oh, and he was handsome.
He was handsome.
Handsome kid, right?
We know that you and Antinois had this thing going.
Poor Antinois.
He turned 20 and got murdered.
Can you believe that?
Talk about jealousy.
Can't run foul.
Can't run a foul.
Ganymede's got to be somewhere.
Zeus has got his Ganymede.
Heracles has his.
Highless.
Jesus has his Peter.
Yeah.
Do you know what Jesus told Peter to do?
He said, if you love me and you're giving me your, your sauce of your, your magic sauce
of drugs, glory.
You're giving me the love that I want you to feed my little sheepkins.
I want you to nourish them.
My little sheepkins.
Yeah.
Do you see what Christianity is?
It is a ring of a pedophile who not only is able to have his cake and to eat it, but
he trains the next generation of cake.
Yeah.
The next thing you know, you're 2023.
We got a bakery full of cake.
It's Cosmos is a bakery full of cake now.
That's how it spreads.
Are you telling me Dr.
Oman?
Are you telling me that Jesus Christ was a spreader of a cult whose purpose was to rape
children perpetually?
Let's look at the facts.
Let's look at the outcome.
Let's look at the outcome.
Yeah.
What do we know about the outcome?
It's tight.
Let's go to one more source.
I want to go to this source and then I'm going to, I think I'm going to call in Gnostic
Informant who's going to give you a little bit of information about some naughty monks
with their boys.
Let's go to this text though.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Do you love me?
Like a son in poros.
Right.
What is this kid?
What is this kid to Jesus?
What's the young kid?
This is talking about the young one.
What is the young one that Jesus has a relationship with undoubtedly?
Right.
The one he says he loved.
And if he uses the same expressions that author a secret secret mark is using means
he stayed with him for the night.
Remember the little kid that's leaning on Jesus?
You didn't realize the last supper.
Do you have that last supper?
Bring that thing.
Da Vinci.
Get it.
Get your bald, dumb head in here and give us that.
