Metiah.
Yep, good.
Fantastic.
And go down to the kana.
According to Helmut Rix, which sounds like an affliction of the glands.
Kana cannot be a local variant of Etruscan kana.
But it's a different word in homonymous.
So, okay, it's got the same sound.
Rix does not agree with the attempt of so-and-so to connect kana with the Greek kana.
Right?
Read.
Read.
Okay.
So you can see the philologist are trying to figure out where the word is coming from.
Right?
Okay.
But supports another hypothesis, the same author, on the meaning of kana as kana-bis.
Right?
The Greek word for cannabis.
Okay.
Rix.
Next one.
Fantastic.
What is the last part of the kana-bis?
Remember that the B-D-I-O-Y.
B-D-I-O-Y.
Remember that these guys bead.
Hear that bead?
B-D-O.
B-D-O.
B-D-O.
Weedale.
Weedale.
There's a diagram somewhere hidden in there, isn't there?
Yes, there is.
Look at the bottom line.
Weedweaw.
Weedweaw.
Weedweaw overseers.
What does that Widrout mean?
It comes down into Latin as Widdeo Wideri.
To see, right?
To see it's the diagram.
You didn't know that six was in there.
Six-six-six.
Again, right?
There it is.
Di-gama-di-gama-di-gama.
Love it.
Don't forget that.
It's the diagram and it's there.
It's part of the word for the kana-bis.
cannabis. It is that element which is giving us sight. There's a reason the dragons who
guard the relics smell like cannabis. There's a reason because it is in all of their incense.
You can't get within a hundred feet of that thing. You can't even, when you're getting
to the island, the sailors, do you know how the sailors find the island? They say that
they can smell it. We're talking about cypress now. You can smell cypress before you can
see it in a boat. You can smell it. Why? Because all of the incense. They don't want you on
that island unless you are high. Yeah. It's a big hot boxing operation. You can't walk
the streets without huffing. Yes. Isn't that wonderful? Make you huff. At least you'll
smell better. You'll be able to take one of those baths that they take. They took that
conna, which the genius scholars say, oh, it's probably the talking about the fibers and
turning them into fabrics from the cannabis. Right, of course. They were stupid. Citians
are making clothing out of it. So, not the citations are making clothing out of it. Okay,
fine. Fine. It's part of their culture. Did you know they were, did you know that they were
doing this? Yeah. Oh my goodness. Give us the next text. We got a, I'm taking so long. Nostics
is going to kill me. Okay. Go to the next one. I just want to take you back to Jesus and I want
you to know that he touched me. This is from Axe. Axe and it's talking about Paul's visit to
Cyprus. We might as well go with Paul. All right. Cause Paul's there and Paul's walking the whole
island. He ends up down there in Paphos. All right. Starts at one side, treks to the other.
It's down there at Paphos. All right. Who do we call Paphia? Paphia. That's Venus, right? That's
Aphrodite. This is Aphrodite's land, Paul. Yes. And what does Paul tell, or what does the text of
Axe tell? It happens to Paul. Go back to the text. Yeah. So they came, they traveled the length of
the island all the way up to Paphos and they found a man, Andratina Magon, a certain magus,
Magus. The Greeks said Magoi. Magoi. What are these Magoi? Well, what else is he? Besides a Magoi,
he's a prophet. He's a false prophet. What else is he? You die on. He's Jewish. And what else is
he? Well, he's got a name they give him. Nomer. And what is it? Bar-i-Essus. Barus-i-Essus. He's
that weighty Jesus. Weighty Jesus. Why do they call him weighty Jesus? Big Jesus. I am Big Jesus.
I'm in Big Jesus. Yeah. Go to the next verse. It's going to explain this title. Okay. I'm going to
give this to you guys tonight. Nobody else. Nobody else. I can promise you. Bart Erman out there.
You haven't done this, Bart. I know you haven't. I know you haven't, right? Whoever else. Harvard.
You guys Princeton. Stand up, people. Stand up. You guys haven't. I'm going to give it just to
you guys tonight from Satanic initiation. I'm going to give it just to you. Are you ready?
Hit me with the next verse after the next. Look at this. Enthistato de autois elumas
homagos. Elimas. That's a name. Elimas de magas, the guy that we were just talking about,
who is called Elimas Bar-Jesus. And people say, where's my whip? And people say,
it's hit me again. Oh, I do that. Bar-Jesus. It's got to be Hebrew. It's got to be the sun.
Son of Jesus. And we'll say Joshua, Jeho-Shua, Jehoshusha. I don't know. Make the stuff up,
people, but your linguistics are terrible. Yeah. Bar-Jesus. Son of Jesus. In a place that has been
speaking Hebrew, speaking Greek for so long that Hebrew has become completely liturgical,
and there's not a trace of Hebrew literature anywhere. Oh my goodness. Oh my goodness. Fantastic.
The fairy tale come true, right? Okay, go to the, let's see what Bar-Jesus does and bring
that same verse. Look, what is Elimas de magas? Just follow the phrase,
because his name, right? This is how it's interpreted. They call him Elimas de magas,
because this is how his name, Bar-Jesus, is interpreted, translated, is rendered. Rendered
probably would be the best word for that. Yeah. Jesus de magas, right? That Bar-Jesus is de magas.
It's what he just said. This is how his name is rendered. They call him Bar-Jesus. It means de
magas. It means de magas, because Jesus, everybody knows, is that mystery. He is that power. Yeah.
Jesus ain't his name. Jesus is a title, and by the time Jesus is using Jesus,
that the magi gave him all the drugs and money for, and calling him, calling him,
calling him Jesus, go to Egypt, shave his head, put him in with the priests, and let him teach him,
give him all my frankincense and some more. They'll make him a whole bunch of drugs.
Yeah. The Christ is a pharmacological term. He is the Christed Jesus. Oh, wow. When he's on that
cross, he is so bombed. He is so bombed. All he can do is scream, scream out how thirsty he is,
