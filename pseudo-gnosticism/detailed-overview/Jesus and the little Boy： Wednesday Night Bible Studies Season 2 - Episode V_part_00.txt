Take me to that happy hour I never had
Show me the girl I never met I wanted so bad
Where is that golden palace? Where is that hawk called destiny?
I think she ran on without me
Boy are you in for it tonight
Tonight we're going to get back in our timeship
And I'm going to leave us right in the little bubble
In the bushes in the Garden of Gethsemane
Tonight we're going deep, chewy, it's light speed, hit it!
Music
Look, I'm not cruel. You know, there's no way to do this better than to take along a child of God
And to have them attempt to entice you to go into the fairy tale backyard
It's usually in the back or it's in the crypt, right?
It's a space that the early Christians are creating this mystery right
It's a place where we come back to a very serious topic
Today I'm going to take you somewhere
I'm going to take you right to Gethsemane right now
We're going right now, you're going to love this
But in order to get there I want to sacrifice, right?
We need, we're necromancers
And I'm assuming that you have your ears to hear and that you're sitting on the throne
We are necromancers and this is how we function
We're going to bring this false reality to you
This fairy tale in the form of a dude, of a dude
What we're doing is we're sacrificing tonight
Reverend Renner, his distinguished one
We're looking at his work
Because he has had the real courage to step forward and say
Who is this naked kid with Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane?
So we catch him there, Mr. Renner
But we think that we're going to get an explanation
I'll tell you, be careful, we're going to go behind the building or into the crypt
We're going down there
And there's going to be some funny things that go on
Let's bring him up, let's bring him up
Let's have a response to this fellow
We're going to do this in a little tiny clips
Hit it
Gethsemane was immense
It covered nearly the whole slope of the Mount of Olives
What we call the Garden of Gethsemane was much more than just trees
It was a cemetery, there were graves
Yeah, first of all, the name Gethsemane, they'll tell you
Right, the first thing he's going to tell you
He hasn't done it yet, but he will
He's going to tell you that this is from the Aramaic
And it means the place of the oil press
Well, no, if it's from the Greek
It means the Pleasure Stones
The Pleasure Stones, isn't that a word for stones?
This is a district
This is a district in a park area
Where there are things like cemeteries
Monuments
Yeah, nice, love it
Anyway, and part of this is called the place
If it's in the Greek, it's the place of the stone pleasure
It's a place that we know that Jesus hung out
It's a place that we know that Jesus hung out
Okay, let's keep that, let's keep that in mind
Okay, hit him again, bring him again
And Jesus came into the grotto to pray regularly
With his apostles
And it was there that Jesus spoke the words, I am he
And the Bible tells us in John chapter 18
That all the soldiers who came to arrest him
When they heard those words, I am he
They begin to do something very strange
All those soldiers begin to go backward
And the King James Version says they fell to the ground
Okay, so here we are, we're in the garden
And all of a sudden a group
A group comes up
These are not regular forces
Yeah, these are heavily armed
Members of the cohort
Yeah, now there's no indication of how many of them came
