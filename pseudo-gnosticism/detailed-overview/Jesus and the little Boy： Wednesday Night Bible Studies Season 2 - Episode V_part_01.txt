He drew from the cohort though to bring it
So we've got temple security
We've got civic, local civic forces
And we've got a crack group
These are the guys you send for the big bus
Anyway, so here they come
Here they come and Judas has led them there
Fantastic, now it's going to get a little bit dark from here
It's going to get a little bit dark from here
He's going to tell us something happened
These soldiers suddenly got drowsy
Okay, now we're going behind the building
Yeah, now we are, come on kids
You've got to know this
You don't know what his skill is
He can tell you
It's because the ancient Greek says it's that way
And let me tell you something
He is lying through his teeth
Let's just look at what the Greek says
Okay, hit us another clip, please
You read the Greek, the words go backward
Really means to wobble, to stumble
They lost their bearing
Jesus says they fell, the Greek word pipto
Which means to fall hard
Jesus released such a blast of divine power
When he said those words, I am he
Which in Greek literally means I am
Yeah, he set off
Wait, I'm just, wait
That's when you realize it's dark
And you're in the basement
What are we doing down here?
How many of us have found ourselves in that position?
What are we doing here?
Jesus let off a what?
Jesus had a blast of what?
That's what the text says, believe you
Because you said you do the Greek
That's what the text says, really, really
Let's go to the, let's go to the
John 15, please
Or 18
This is John 18, this is the text
That he's talking about
Yeah, good
Look at starting at six
That's the, that's the ego
The ego Amy is the response, right
So in the world of the basement
In the fairy tale they will tell you
Jesus spoke out, boom, like a
You know, it's kind of just magic
Everybody falls down
Right, it gets better
Just wait, it gets better
But that's not what the Greek says
That's not what the Greek says at all
Bring the Greek up again
What does it say?
Ego Amy, why is he saying ego Amy?
He's saying I am
Because they asked him, are you Jesus of Nazareth?
And he says, because it's a crowd
A delegate of soldiers
Right, they brought out the unit
That takes down the real bad guys
They're heavily armed
Right, we're going to see this
Jesus makes a note of this
He says something out of his own mouth
Out of his own mouth
Tonight we have firsthand evidence
We've been trying to establish a motive here
For Jesus, and there are those of you
Who have been saying, you know
