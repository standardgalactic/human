Come out here so heavily armed
Like I'm a pirate?
Right?
What does that mean?
Well, it's especially somebody at sea
So there's some kind of sea connection
That's where we're getting pirate
Brigand
Buccaneer, right?
Buccaneer
Later, perates
Now you know where you get the word pirate from
Yeah, but what kind of...
What are these?
Shiver me timbers?
These aren't the guys that make Johnny Depp
Look good
This is not that kind of a pirate
Right?
These are sex traffickers
Should we bring up that same?
Look at the very bottom
Used by Lycophron
Who is Lycophron?
Lycophron is the poet who is
Preserving the song of Cassandra
Yeah, the song Cassandra
Who is the Bacchic Sibyl
Yeah, wonderful, wonderful
And you'll notice there in that Lycophron
It's okay, you'll notice there in that Lycophron
That we have a reference to
Child abduction
Yeah, it turns out in antiquity
I mean, let me just lay this thing straight
You want to come to the garden of
The garden of grave delight
Here we are in this place
Take a whiff around
You know what you smell?
You smell groups of traffickers
Who will sail into a port
Jump off the ship armed
Armed with enough force
To overwhelm the local authorities
And take kidnap
Take prisoner
Young men and young women
Boys and girls
And this kind of thing
Oh, why do they take them?
To take them somewhere in traffic
Them to sell them, right?
Yeah, to sell them
It's not very nice
It's not very nice indeed
Yes, but this is the word
The lady says the word for this trafficker
And so when Jesus says
Would you come out against me so heavily armed
What do you think I am, a trafficker?
The fact that there's a naked kid
Standing next to him
The fact that there's a naked kid
Standing next to him
And that verb that's used for a company
When it says the naked boy was accompanying Jesus
That verb is the verb that is used
Of soldiers and of slaves
Yeah, there was that boy
Accompanying him naked
Let's hear what else he has to say
About the...
Go ahead
Jesus was declaring that he was God in the flesh
And there was such a blast of power
It knocked all the soldiers to the ground
