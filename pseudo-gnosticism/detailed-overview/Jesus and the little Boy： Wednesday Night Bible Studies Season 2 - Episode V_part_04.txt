Eventually they got up
They regained their bearings
And Jesus surrendered himself to them
And as they walked out of the grotto
Out of the cave through this area
The Bible tells us
In Mark chapter 14 verses 51 and 52
About something very unusual
It says suddenly there appeared in the midst of them
A naked boy with a linen cloth
Who is the naked boy in the Garden of Gethsemane
Who is that naked boy in the Garden of Gethsemane
Who is that naked boy in the Garden of Gethsemane
Alas, someone is finally talking about it
Nice job
Nice job
It's taken us, what is this?
1,400 years
We solved it once a long time ago
He's a cousin
He's a cousin
Now, okay, so let's see
This whole thing about the...
This whole thing about the...
We'll come back to the glory bomb in a minute
Don't play that video
This will come back to the glory bomb in just a second
But the blowing off of the feet
You can see it's not even in the text
Right?
And you'll notice that
Translators since Tyndale
Have been following this same path
So you can track this man, Mr. Renner's education
You can get it down to his education
About where he came up with these ideas
When he says, I am
And let's off the glory bomb
Causing all the soldiers to fall around
Right?
And by the way, that stuff he said about balance
There's not in that at all
It's not there at all
He's making stuff up
That's why I'm saying, these are lies
He is making stuff up
There's nothing to do with staggering
In that Greek, period
Nothing
They simply went around and took custody of him
Right?
Took him down
Yeah, yeah
It's a bust, right?
It's a bust
And they've got a big unit out there
This is fantastic
Okay, hit him again
Well, all around the grotto
All around the Garden of Gethsemane
There were graves, including fresh graves
This was a dead boy
That's why he was carrying a linen cloth
Or a burial shroud
The Jews buried their people naked
And covered them with that kind of a shroud
This boy was laying in his grave
And when Jesus spoke those words, I am he
The same power that knocked 300 to 600 soldiers
On to their back
Apparently touched a dead boy
That had recently been buried
The boy came crawling out of his grave
With his linen cloth
Stumbles into the midst of the whole scene
That's taking place in the Garden of Gethsemane
Or here we find the moment of Jesus' arrest
