He said, well, what?
You're arresting me like I'm a
Pirate of people
You know, like I'm a sex trafficker
So...
No accomplices
Prostitutes
And accountants
Arrested in the public park at 4 a.m.
With a naked boy
Armed resistance was provided
So we think we've come to the place
That Jesus regularly hangs out
Where he does his biz
You don't see him doing any carpentry, do you?
Right?
But he is hanging out with prostitutes
And accountants
With naked boys
In places that we know

Hang
His place to hang

You know the process
Of trading children and antiquity
Is directly connected

Now, Reverend
Reverend Glorybaum
We'll just call him
Reverend Glorybaum
Who has, you know
For those of you who say it's too much
You're being too harsh on Reverend Glorybaum
No, no, no, no
We raid these basements
And when we find
When we find the evangelicals and the Catholics
We find the Presbyterians and the Baptists
And we find the free church of Christ
And the holy, immaculate, nationalist association
Of we're going to take over the world
When we find them taking people into places
Where they're taking advantage of them
It's our duty to stand up to that
You know
So, so far what we've got
I wanted to show you a little bit of the prophecy
Of Cassandra
And I wanted you to see
