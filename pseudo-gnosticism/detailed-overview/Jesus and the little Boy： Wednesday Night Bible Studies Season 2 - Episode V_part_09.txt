This is enough
We're there
We see Jesus
He's calling himself a child trafficker
Right, not only that
But remember, guys
He shows up with the stuff
The goop all over him
You don't know what that is
What's he been doing with that kid?
What's that rag for?
Right, they don't know these things
Right
It always comes back to that dracina
That dracina
That our prophetess Cassandra talks about
Who bears that venom
It always comes back to her
Cassandra says she has the dipsass
She calls her
She calls her the very same title
Of Jesus's anti-venom
That he didn't get on the cross
Right, that's hers
That's hers
Thank you, Magdal
The Scythian maga
That's fantastic
You see, there's a brighter
We've been looking at Jesus
The child trafficker with his naked boy
But there's a much brighter light around it
That is divine
That is divine
And that's her
The fact that she is controlling
From the back room
Right?
It's amazing
It's magic control
Love it
Mary the Magdal
Yeah, fantastic Scythian word for maga
Wait a minute
You thought Magdalene was from this in the Hebrew
No, it's not
Yeah, it's not
You mean I shouldn't have studied Hebrew in seminary?
No, you shouldn't have
You're wasting your time
Yes, it's all in Greek, bro
Just read it
Read it
Pirate, laystace, and realize
That every time you go to church
And every time you take that communion
And every time you give your attention
To that power
You are propping up
History's most popular child sex trafficker
I think that's it
Let's call it there
But before we do
Let's take one more look at the image
Let's take one more look at the image
Of where we're getting all of this
Viper venom, the stipsass
Go ahead
Hail Satan
And if you can, avoid the pirate
Who sells children and any of his followers
Show me the girl I never met
I want it so bad
Where is that golden palace
Where is that horse called destiny
I think she ran off without me
