It's hours tonight.
Madea and the snake charmers
Dragon venom think of vipers
Make you hemorrhage blood
Hemlock wolves bang
Lavender moon rise
They're at it again
Electrical blood
Bind you with wonderful drugs
Raw opium drifts
Hail Satan in the dark harbor
Open your eyes
Give you vision
Go to the serpent temple
And take some dragon venom
In the power of the black mirror
I'm with the root cutters
The darn bringers
Madea the sorceress
Venus producer of the sweetest nectars
Dance with the muse
The radio specter
The muse sings to me
Whisper lev fate
Hold my heart so dear
Dancing in a dream
Hail Satan
Oh, God, I can feel it coming tonight.
Oh, I love it. I love it. I love it.
I'm going to give you a gift.
I'm going to give you a gift,
but I'm going to start out with a mood setter
while we get ready and the ship is running.
We're going back in time.
I want you to be able to set
the mood.
Hit it. Where's that first?
Where's that first slide?
Give it to me, Chewie.
Read this together quickly and then we'll get to the gift
because I got you a gift tonight.
What are we talking about tonight?
She is who we're talking about here tonight.
We're talking about the sotera.
The sotera.
What is the sotera?
The better question is, who is the sotera?
Before there was a savior,
Jesus, who was Christed,
there was a savior
who led the people of Athens.
Yes, yes.
What did she end up giving us?
Oh, God, you're going to love it.
It's all the beauty.
It's all the gorgeousness and gorgeosity.
How are we going to get to her tonight?
We're going through a dead dude.
I'm telling you this.
A dead dude who copied another dead dude.
This is a fifth century dead dude
copied another dead dude from the first and second.
And that dead dude copied a third dead dude
from Hellenistic Greece.
Woo, Alexandria baby.
Alexandria is where he was.
And what was he?
He was a lexicographer.
He was a what?
He was a writer of words.
We have, through his descendants,
we have passed on his work.
It's unusual words.
Imagine it this way.
It's a dictionary of unusual words.
And there are 50,000 of them.
You mean the ancient Greek language,
such a great and powerful mother,
Guinness Book of World Records,
strong, strongest human language.
Yeah.
You mean she had 50,000?
Well, strange or unique words.
Yes.
It took some sophistication to define.
Yes.
And guess what?
We have those 50,000.
That's more than most languages function on.
Oh, God.
Just the unusual words.
Did you know there's 10,000 and alpha alone?
This is the lexicon by Seekus.
Love it.
He's the final copyist.
Basically, this guy from Alexandria.
Oh, it's lovely.
It's lovely.
It's a treasure.
It's a treasure for linguistic analysis,
because you can tell what words are coming from.
There's no, we don't need into your pen, right?
That's imaginary.
Woo.
No, we have written down Pulaski.
And oh, God, it's gorgeous.
Calcolithic.
Think of the horses.
Live on your horse, right?
I just cut out a considerable number of the audience.
We have to learn that way to get back to that native Greek
to see what it's doing.
Let's see.
Bring that first one back up.
We're looking for the savior.
Look at her here.
So theta.
And by the way, we're going to have Gnostic on in about 45
minutes.
Gnostic.
He's got some things to talk about.
Some goodies.
He's getting the goodies over and over again.
Look.
So what is this?
So theta.
That's Athena.
What is, what does her name mean?
Her name means she who's without death.
He, he said, what?
He said, the savior is she who is without death.
Athena.
She is the guardian of everything that you need.
She stands.
She stands with justice.
Oh, love it.
Love it.
What else does it say about the savior?
For those of you who are evangelicals, we're looking at the savior, the savior.
This is before Jesus.
This is what Jesus borrowed when he took his 12 kitties and turned them into prostitute.
I'm going to show you tonight from his seekius right out of the Greek, right out of the Greek.
This is going to shake your world.
First, let's shake your world.
Let's really shake your world.
I'm giving a gift now.
I'm giving a gift.
Give me the next.
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.
Before we get there.
I just want people to notice.
Give that first one.
Look at the end of this.
Look at the end of this line.
What else is the savior?
What else is the salvation congregation?
It is according to Galen and Antidotus.
It's an antidote.
It's an antidote.
That's curious.
Very curious tonight.
We're going to go to the purple.
We're going to go to the purple and I'm going to bring you the purple.
Are you ready?
Are you ready, people?
Are you ready?
Bring it up.
Now, I promised you we would fulfill the prophecy.
We would bring everything into complete and perfect unity with the song of the muse.
And tonight we're going to do that.
Are you ready?
Oh, I'm working on the purple.
Boom.
What happens?
A reporter friend of mine, a journalist friend of mine says, oh my God.
And Aquine, an all around great guy says, hey, did you see this today?
Boom.
Give me that article.
Here.
You wanted it.
You blood sucking purple loving people.
Incredibly rare die says CBS news.
That was once worth more than gold found in the UK.
Seriously.
You got to say that seriously.
Worth more than gold.
Really?
Oh my God.
What does that say about us?
Look at our ancestors.
Just human ancestors.
Look at how they're looking at us.
Look what they're seeing.
It's the watchers, man.
You can only go so long with the watchers.
Give me the next part of the article.
You wanted it now.
Archeologists working in England found a mysterious lump of a purple substance that in Roman times
would have been worth more than gold.
Shut up with about the money.
Research is fantastic.
Let's go to the next one.
What they do with this purple lump.
I could have told them, chewy.
I could have told them what they can do with the purple lump.
The substance was found during a 2023 excavation.
That's just about around a quarter, one of a Roman bathhouse, a bathhouse.
That's a place for hygiene, baby.
That's a place for hygiene.
What do you find there, chewy?
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
A bathhouse.
The remains of the third century.
Oh, it's the third century.
Building exists on the grounds of what is now a cricket club.
Who cares?
Tear down that cricket club.
Every Brit just went, oh, off the rocker.
That's how you get to it underneath.
It's all the junk on top that gets in the way.
Tell those people.
Go play your cricket around the corner.
Go, street cricket.
The team works with the British Geological Society to test the material.
Fantastic.
Look, didn't, wasn't there, didn't somebody say something about this somewhere back there?
Somewhere, somebody said they're going to find the purple.
They found purple.
They found the purple.
Isn't that nice?
Oh, God.
You thought, look, for, for everybody who was uncomfortable and was like, are you sure?
I need to double check this.
Here you go.
The library's first contribution was the purple porfura.
What is the latest contribution?
The latest contribution is the porfura.
That's what we do.
All right.
Are you ready for the power of the muse?
Are you ready for the power of the muse?
Amen.
You're a treasure.
Thank you.
That's so nice.
I mean that sincerely.
I know you do.
You're a great guy.
Oh, look at that.
Look at that.
Oh, that's a little darkness in that.
Love it.
Okay.
Let's keep going.
Boom.
Here's what I want to bring you guys.
What is that?
It says right here, right?
These are the definitions that we have in our lexicon.
Our lexicon.
What are we doing?
We're defining Greek words, not by some British dude's mouth with the stale 1850 air.
Who brought that corpse in?
There's always, you're always going to have to have that.
Who brought that corpse in?
There's always, you're always going to have a Victorian corpse.
Whenever you study classics, you have to have some Victorian corpse somewhere.
You sit on its chest and it breathes out this air of pomposity.
It's stale.
You're dead, Alfred.
You're dead.
Come here, Alfred.
Alfred's my dead Victorian friend.
Come here, Alfred.
Hold on your pants, Alfred.
Why is that so much louder, Chewie?
Then in my ears, let's go.
Let's keep going.
Ceterion.
What is it?
It's a kind of a drug.
