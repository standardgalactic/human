Artalaban in Afghanistan
The people who tend to cover up women
Splash acid on them
Take away their rights
Those kind of people
Rape them when they're twelve
But okay, pay your fine
And you can marry the kid
That type
This is a goddess that doesn't abide
That type
Yeah, you can't get to that type
Artalaban, you can cure Artalaban
Did you know that?
You can cure an Orthodox Jew
You can cure an evangelical Christian
All of them want the apocalypse
All of them
But you can cure them
You can cure them
Take them
You
You
Just a little bit of rockiness there
Yeah, we got it
Should we take care of it
Right through an asteroid belt
You know what I mean?
Sometimes it happens
For those of you who are commenting
On my internet
Ha ha, funny funny
Yes, yes in fact
It's the price I pay for being up against the mountain
Yes, but I'll take the mountain mother any day
If we have interruptions
We can always come back
Nothing I say is that important
I assume everybody heard the cure
So we'll go on from there
Fantastic
Here we go
Tell me about drugs
Yeah, why did she teach that wise Jason
Yasun
Oh
We'll get back
We got some magi running around
I'm sorry, there's some magicians
Okay, chill chill
Here we go
Why did she give these things to Yasun
He might
Fool
Take away the
Shame
That Medea
Had in the company of her parents
Oh wow
That sounds
That sounds like something, this prince
By the way, he's really handsome right
He's been trained
By those centaurs
Right, you're in trouble
You're in trouble
If the guy that you're dating
Has been trained by centaurs
You gotta watch your drink all the time
Right, watch your drink
But they needed her
She's the only one that could make this work
So they needed Medea
To do it
And that's why Cyprus is there
And
I promise you drugs
I keep promising you drugs
Come on kids, let's go into the park
Right
I just
I just realized
Somebody asked about
The
Pirate
The child trafficker
Right
That Leistace
Is the title of Aphrodite
It's a place of
Aphrodite
The child abductor of Aphrodite
The pirate of Aphrodite
You wanna read the pirate of Aphrodite
The child trafficker
And what he does
Does that mean child trafficker
It means exactly what it means
In the ancient text
And the ancient text tell us
That it's all
It's all about
That taking of the
Youth
For the sale
Yeah
Dedication
It's a dedication
There wouldn't be so many of you
Killing each other
Say the watchers
You wouldn't be
If you had this mystery
In operation
The mystery of Anemia
Isn't that nice
In the mystery of Anemia
You can take
A person
Who might go out
And do violent things
To other people
Yeah
You can give that person
Into the hands
Of the great queen
Yeah
And that person will come back
Having looked into the eyes
Of the mother
