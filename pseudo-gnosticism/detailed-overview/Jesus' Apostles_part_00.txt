Mystery Judas
The little bitch that you give to the goddess, Athena follows a devious smile
She makes men fulfill their desires to be worth the woman
Crystal of Aphrodisiac, once you are out producing the theory egg
Watch out, your brain will open up, Athena with a purple cuff
Cheat you all up, control the crush
If you begin to place the ball on the move, magic is best sin
Wish you would
Cheat you all up, control the crush
If you begin to place the ball on the move, magic is best sin
Wish you would

Who is the wisest?
Oh, Oracle
Who is the wisest?
Socrates is the wisest
Socrates
You know why?
Because he knew he didn't know
And he knew other people who said they knew
Were full of it
And he could just tear you apart
In a conversation
And for that the Oracle
Declared him to be the wisest of all
The wisest of all those people
Do you see classical morality?
Your greed stains your soul
With a stench of ruin
Do you know where that gentleman is?
That gentleman is in hell
Being punished for his greed

Do you know why Socrates had one cloak?
Because he didn't care
