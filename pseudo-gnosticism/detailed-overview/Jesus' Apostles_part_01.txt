What you thought about him
He listened to his daemon
Give me the next one
These are funny
This dude is the biggest
Psyop ever
I'm a Psyop now
And I think he's been drinking a lot of drugs
From the seriously
Seriously
Psyop
Psyop
This dude is the biggest Psyop ever
Bruh
If you think that this
Has the capacity to carry on
Any sort of sophisticated operation
That involves, I don't know
Things like planning
No, no bras
You're in the wrong place
Give me the next one
Finally, let's hear some sense
From Leo
Is that Leo?
We'll just say Leo
If you listen to the fourth three
Now, what is this?
This is a note that was left
This is a note that was left
This is a message that's left
On an interview
No, it was a review
Somebody did a review of Lady Babylon
And this was one of the comments
That they left
If you listen to the fourth three
In a bit hour podcast
It gives one a drastically
Different portrait of the man
Well, that's odd
You think you didn't see
You only saw through their clips, didn't you?
Right, and it gave you a kind of
Distorted view
That's okay, thank you for saying it
I don't know if what he says
Is true or not
Right, he knows a whole
He knows a whole lot more about it
Than most people
Okay, thank you, that's nice
But you don't have to say it
It could all be absolute nonsense
But those were three of the most
Far out and fascinating hours
I've gotten from a podcast in years
I want to show you a couple of clips now
And I want you to sit with me
And the watchers
And I want you to see the atheistic
Monist soup in which you live
Are you ready?
It's topsy-turvy
Let's go for it, Chewie
Give me the first one
What I think that I got very confused by
Is that I'm confused as the wrong word
I am skeptical of
Lady Babylon's ability to translate anything
Interesting, okay
He doesn't have his PhD
But okay
That doesn't mean anything
I agree
He claims that he can read another language
That does not make you a good translator
I'm pretty sure that he's just making shit up
It's like those little games where you know
Like you're like, okay, make this letter
Be this letter
I think he's just saying
Okay, this word means this now
Okay, so that's what she thinks
That's what she thinks
You know, what's funny
Is when you see people who come
With a preformed conclusion already
They just have something there
They have some kind of
Now, just ask yourself
Is this person who's talking
Any sort of samurai?
Is there a reason?
They're putting down this other samurai
Maybe they're, I don't know
Maybe they're in linguistics
Maybe they're in classics
Do you know people have been asking
And vetting almond
And do you know what they're finding?
They're finding Hail Satan
That's what they're finding
They're finding that I'm just a classicist
And I'm just doing what classicists do
Yeah, yeah, it's no, there's no trick
There's no, no, it's just translation
Of those texts
Now, this person doesn't even know
Doesn't even know the discipline
And yet is willing to come out
With a general statement and say
Okay, let's hear some more
Let's hear some more
Did you see, by the way, how quickly
The gentleman turned around
When he said he does have a PhD
And she was like, that doesn't mean anything
You're right
You're right, Ms. Tightbox
And that's her name in all fairness
You're right, you're right
What I did was 12 years of university
That brought me three degrees in Greek
Ancient Greek classical philology
