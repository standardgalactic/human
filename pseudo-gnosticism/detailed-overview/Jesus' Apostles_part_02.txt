That's what I did
And ever since then, I've been reading it
That's who I am, that's where I am
So let's hit the next clip
Let's see what, watch the world, people
What they do, go
I have to say this right now
Especially for the people who are listening
To the podcast, you're right, he's an idiot
No genius would ever catch it like that
That is so dated
That looks like King Cobra Jaffa
That's his catch
That's not a nice play
And he has this shrine
That includes his riding crop
Which he, as you just heard, is about to grab
And again, for the people who are only listening
He's about to use it to thwack the floor
A whole bunch
He's a mental patient
Lucy, I heard he's single
This man is crazy, mommy
Pass me the chicken nuggets, Tom
No sauce
I'm getting married again
And he's the first guy I'm killing
Alright, alright
So you see
You see where the level of penetration is
Right, you see where the level of engagement is
Where people can engage
You're dealing with people who can only engage
On the surface to start with
Right, and they're not here because they want to be
They're here because they're trying to work
Their way up the ladder
Right, and they're going to critique this person
Without considering anything, background, any sort
But that's okay, we don't need them
You know why?
Because people can do those kind of things
And they have done them
They love to do them in the dark ages
Miss Titebox
Miss Titebox, do you know what you did wrong?
Miss Titebox
You messed with somebody who's well-trained
You messed with somebody who knows the art
And just to put your brain at ease
There's really not a difference between reading and translating
Because you're doing the same thing
Okay, I don't sit around and talk to the UN
Right, I don't do that
I don't change things from one language to another
I jump into the pit of the Greek
And I swim as deep as I can
That's what I do
That's my thing
Does it matter that my kitchen
Does my kitchen not impress you?
Seriously?
Does my kitchen not impress you?
Yes, yes
Do you see what happens to a society
That is no longer guided by polytheism
When you step away from justice
When you step away from those values
That make you a woman
When you step away from that hunter
What happens to you?
You become concerned about kitchens
Do you know?
I'm going to say something to half of you
Half of you out there
You are a mere reflection
Just a shade of the great women who came before you
Just a shade
Oh, if I had the power to give you
To become that vampire
Oh, God
Oh, God
Let's take a trip tonight again
Let's take a trip and look at the text
I'm going to flash up the one text up here
I'm going to give you one text
And it's going to guide everything tonight
Are you ready?
This is the mystery
What is going on here?
We're talking about the death of Judas
Bring him up, Chewie
We're talking about the death of Judas
Or what has been believed to be
The death of Judas
This is the crime scene
And who is our witness?
Our witness is Peter
And he is saying
After Jesus in his vampire form
Was taken back up into the Uranus
Which is where they all go, right?
After he was taken up
Peter and his gang
His gang of teenage cultists
Had to perpetuate the right
So they needed
Because Judas had been betrayed
And so what happens is
This is a little bit later
Right?
And what are we doing?
We're forming another mystery 12
Just like Paul does
Just like Jesus does
Just like anybody does
Who's following Ionic life
Whether it's your synagogues
That have Ion with the zodiac around them
Or whether it's your Christians
Talking about Ionic life
You need those 12
You need those 12
So what they do
They appointed another kid
