Catholics and all the evangelicals,
all the Charismatics, right, you're going to get to see what this is actually
doing, and how do we do that, we do it from the
Greek, that's all, we do it from the Greek, give me the
first one, look at this people, having said that, here's some Latin
look at this, you know what this says
it's part of a quote, it's only part, but it's part
of a quote that says magic, right, comes from
medicine, right, why would they say magic came from medicine
this is plenty, why would they say this in antiquity, because of the
drugs, right, drugs are a part of medicine
but they are also the driver of magic,
yeah, so to them it's, you know, he says
nobody will doubt, right, like everybody knows
give me the next one, just a couple
of more, I wanted to give you, look at the first word here
now you were talking about Judas
I know, and now I'm talking about buprestis
what is that, it's a beetle
it's a beetle, a beetle
that in antiquity they said it's a little bit different
from, but it's in the same group, does the same thing
as cantarides, cantarides
what is cantarides, that's one of the blister
that produces little resin
and you know what it does, that resin is a love gift
it's a love gift, it's given to protect the eggs
the female will receive it and protect the eggs with it
but it's quite toxic, and why am I mentioning
buprestis, go back to the beginning, go back to that quote with buprestis
please, so he says the Greeks
talk about it in a couple of different ways
they say first of all it's good just for consumption of your
diet's sake, and otherwise they talk about it
you gotta use remedies against the drug with it
this is the really poisonous
toxic stuff, and even its name indicates
it's a poison, because what happens
when the cows, that's where the boo comes from
when the cows eat it, they disiliere
they disiliere, what does that mean
it means they explode
it means they explode, they vent
you've heard of the word
dehis
when you have a surgery and you've been cut open
you don't want that closed
tissue to open up again
this is what they're trying to prevent, is the opening of the tissue
what happens, there is a
bursting, there is a bursting with the cattle
now
I used to work on a dairy, I didn't see any cattle burst
I did see some die from bloat
and I know that's a possibility
but that is not what this author is talking about
when a cow dies from bloat, they don't explode anyway
this is what happens, his blank
spill out of his body
let's go to the next one
people I want you to meet really quick here
look at the Greek
what is this
this is the art of healing with ointments, you didn't even know this existed did you
you didn't even know it existed
we're talking about using ointments
crazy drug ointments
let's see some crazy drug ointments
I know you guys love the crazy
look at the Yatra Maya is a feminine physician
isn't that nice, so for those of you who think women didn't do it
they were in medicine
love it, give me the next one
fairyac says plenty
is the name given to a preparation devised by luxury, a composition formed of
600 different ingredients, and this while nature has bestowed upon
such numbers of remedies, each of which would have fully answered the purpose
employed by itself, the mythrodatic antidote
is composed of 4 and 50 ingredients
now listen to this, 54 ingredients
used in exactly the same proportion
and the quantity prescribed is in some cases so small
as the 60th part of one denarius
right, we're in the world of grams now
we're talking about antiquity
and the complex compound drugs that they're using
in mystery rites, and the measurements are that
precise, you know where they're getting that
precision, that's bronze age, late bronze age precision with
pharmacology, this is why when somebody comes on
and they say I don't like his kitchen
you know that there are certain people out there
that you can show that reality to, you can give it
to them and they'll say thank you
to other people who already have a pre-formed notion
right, you can stand them in front of the mirror
this is Bacchic initiation
this is Bacchic initiation
people are forced to look into the mirror
look at what Ms. Typebox did tonight
right, she talked about things she had no
clue, no knowledge of, whatsoever and dismissed
it entirely, just dismissed
that's the same thing the leaders of the theology
schools do, it's the same thing
that Jordan Peterson does
they come from outside the field
and condemn and just deny
everything, look at his kitchen
do you see why Socrates was walking around like he was
and why the oracle was saying he was the wisest
Athenian who walked around saying these people
don't know what they're doing, you don't know what justice is
you don't know what justice is, all you have to do is look at your
basic definitions, everything that you think
is right will be turned on its head
and you'll see just from the scientific breakdown of your own stupid thoughts
by the power of reason, you're an idiot
and if you haven't come to that place yet
you end up, you know, you end up
saying look at the man's kitchen, here's my kitchen of that
right, if that's your level, if that's your level of depth
right, but the ancient mysteries and the women who made them
the oracles who perpetuated them
you do them a great
