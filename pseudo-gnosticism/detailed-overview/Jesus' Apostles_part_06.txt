that plenty is like
these people are just bragging because it's impossible to get those tiny, tiny amounts of measurements
he's so amazed at how the level of the science
has reached in pharmacology
we have accounts of people, doctors
who accidentally overdose patients
we have accounts of it and it's not pretty but it's happening
there's no FDA there
there's no regulations there
give me the next one
as to the other media virtues attributed to bugs
because you think we're dealing with bugs for the cure of vomiting
people you can use bugs to stop vomiting
people don't know what cordon fever here is but it's a malaria
it's a type of malaria
they have chronic fevers, populations of chronic fevers
and they notice, hey there's a
there's a relation here between how many of us have fevers
and how many of the swamps we're cleaning up
and all this malaria, this bad air
that means bad air
the big picture look, the holistic look that they've got
of the world around them, you're part of a system
you're part of a system and you are balanced within that system
and we can give you drugs to bring you to places that you can't be brought otherwise
watch what happens
what do we find, what do we use bugs to treat
I look upon them as utterly unfounded and not worthy of
further notice, they are employed however for the treatment of lathergy
there we go, lathergy that's interesting, you want a little pick me up
drink some bug juice and with some fair reason
as they successfully neutralize the narcotic effects of the poison
of the asp
so wait a minute, this is not some dude who's just walking along
it's bitten by an asp, this is a dude who is using the
asp and he's countering that asp with this
anti-narcotic
with this anti-narcotic
do you see how sophisticated the plant, the flora and fauna
bridge was with these people and it's coming through the
greek, it's not coming through the latin, I'm giving you a latin source but it's coming through the greek
from the viper are prepared, nobody ever believes me when I say
these things, so here they are in their words, from the viper are
prepared those tablets which are known as theriac to the greeks
again who are we talking about, just plenty
he's just giving us the encyclopedia of the day
he's Mr. Encyclopedia, he's going to talk about magic and medicine
he's going to talk about drugs and god he goes on and on and on
give me the next one, give me the next one
a pounded scorpion, this is just for fun for those of you who want something fun to think about
a pounded scorpion, it's got to be pounded
this thing can't be drowned and peppered
it's got to be pounded
and it neutralizes the venom of a spotted lizard, I don't even know what kind of spotted lizard that is
in most of these texts you'll look at the notes
and I'll say we don't know what species this is, it's probably this one
right because it's in this region that he's describing
oh yeah they have this spotted lizard
but you can use the scorpion venom
so now you understand why in the mythrodatic depictions
of the god, you've always got like scorpion
I'm going to scorpion trying to sting his testicles
yeah
you use the venoms as compounds
right, use them as compounds, now remember
when you have the blister beetle on board
and you are bleeding anally, I want you to just wait
you're bleeding anal, crimson blood
this is not the black blood you get from any intestine higher up
this is that crimson anal blood
and that mixes with purple
do you know what's happening, that purple is getting absorbed
that purple is getting absorbed
they're mixing in your own body, they're mixing drugs
is
Christ, is Christ a drug term?
seriously people, seriously I can't
count, I can't count the references
of course it is
and notice, I want to say one thing
when we have Jesus in company
notice that people won't go back and actually look
for themselves, notice there's a fear
a palpable fear in looking at
the original text, there's a fear that you may find something
let's figure out what's going on with Judas here because we know
we're in the cult, we know, give me that next one, there you go
watch this people, hear the remedies
that you can derive from canthardes, you mean that blister beetle
a terrible forceful erection that makes my anus bleed
in different parts of my body bleed, I've got to come and
get me the purple, you mean those kinds can be used
as remedies, but with reference to canthardes
there's been considerable controversy on the subject seeing that
taken internally, there are poisons attended with excruciating
pains in the bladder, that's nice to know
then it keeps going, I just wanted you to see that you can
talk about remedies derived from these very same
poisons, which they know are poisonous
and canthardes are produced from small grub found
most particularly in the spongy excrescences which grow on the
stem of the dog rose, isn't that interesting, why the dog rose?
and still more abundantly on the ash, other kinds again are found upon
the white rose, look at how observant they are and this is just
plenty, what is he doing, he is a slave
read to him all day long, while he's doing
government business, he is a slave follow him around and read to him
when he's in the bath, slave read to him
and then he takes all that information and piles it into encyclopedia
that's what he's doing here, so it's not that he knows this right, he's picked
it up from another author and what does that tell you, it tells you
kiddies you've been lied to by these lying
people
the people who told you, nobody reads an antiquity
I heard somebody, some septuagent expert
quote unquote, oh god
nobody, nobody reads an antiquity
what are you talking about, what are you talking about
look at all the information that's slammed into this, that plenty is
gleaning, what do you think he's getting those scrolls, they got all sorts of
libraries all over Rome, they got one on the palette
time, Christians burn it down
oh god, give me the next one, we gotta decipher the mystery
mystery, all these insects are extremely
efficacious for the cure of blank and blank, it is said too that the act is a
