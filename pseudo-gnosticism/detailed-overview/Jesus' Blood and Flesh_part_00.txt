Hold on
I'm with my DST
Everything I see is cream
Straight from the bang
Of the dragon
The tracks bump
It is the thing
Athena knows my slang
In the dark harbor
The drugs weigh a ton
Kachanga Lane
Creed Moore hit the mark
Bang bang
We're here to save the children
The museum we're building
Anti-Christ prescription
Dragon venom
Welcome back to Lady Babylon
This is Initiating Apocalypse
Now, I just want to start
With a warning
I want to start with a warning
This is going to go somewhere
Historically with Jesus
That you may not be able
To recover from
You guys know that you want it
You want the deep stuff
You want that underbelly
You want those deep dark secrets
That Jesus Christ is keeping
You want them
I know you do
We're going to find them tonight
We're going to find them tonight
And I'm going to surprise you
Because we're going
To use the voice
I am going to unlock for you
The prophecies
So that you can see them
It's much better
You know what we're doing
We're going in for a drug night
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
We're going to be reborn
I'm taking you back there
Are you ready?
They're going to serve things up right away
But in good traditional
Lady Babylon style
I'm going to purify the temple
And who would we need
If we're going to go to the core of Christianity
Who do we need
To purify this place?
We need the mother of Bacchus
Hit it, Chewie
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
We're going in for a night
Where we are going to come back from it
Happy to be alive
His Holy H�를
A thousand years
before Christianity
Seven hundred years
before Judaism
People followed
the mystery of the Wanasa
This is what
we bring to you tonight
And it's our privilege Chewie. Thank you. Thank you for working the night shift. I appreciate it
I'm gonna bring up a comment. I want to bring to your attention before I flash
The revelation before you I want to bring up this comment Chewie
Check this out say ten at congregation. Let's read. This is a Greek
This is from Angie by the way, and this is the best comment
I have seen in a long time because I am always telling you people
And you don't know you don't know I could be pulling some kind of BS out of my hat
But I'm not I told you modern Greek is different from ancient Greek
Modern Greek is different from ancient Greek people give me a hard time for that because they don't understand
Finally, who did we find we found Angie? That's right Angie
And she says as a Greek who knows how to speak read and write modern Greek
I have to say ancient Greek is not the same
It's not the same
Thank you Angie
Bravo
