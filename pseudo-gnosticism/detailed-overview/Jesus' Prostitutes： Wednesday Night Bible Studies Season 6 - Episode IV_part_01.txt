Yeah.
I want you to look at the anthropology here.
Look, it's made up of Clay's key and Fusus's nature.
Literally, it's a spell.
It's a song to open up the secret parts of a woman.
They have a word for that?
Yeah.
They have a word for that.
And we've got to know this stuff.
If we're going to get inside with the initiates, we've got to know this stuff.
Right.
This is our vocabulary.
Fantastic.
Okay.
They're going to meet us at the door.
The apostles.
Boom.
Boom.
Boom.
Hear it?
Yeah.
It's going to be a little bit loud.
You're going to have to shout a little bit.
We're going in.
Yeah.
Here they are.
Ready?
Give me the next text.
Oh.
Up it.
Up it.
Ghost.
Summon.
I summon the ghost.
Of who?
Who is this guy?
Clement.
Clement.
We're that stinky.
Come here, Clement.
Come here.
Oh, you like the stroma taste.
By the way, it's not the stroma itself.
That's a wrong stroma taste.
You like it, don't you?
Moses.
Shut up and sit down.
You love it.
I love this part.
Watch this.
We're going to bring in.
We're going to bring in.
Oh, God.
This is a man who rejected his parents' paganism.
He was on the inside.
He was on the inside.
He knows all the terminology.
He's the one who comes forward, you know?
And he's got this letter.
He's got this letter to Theodore.
He got to straighten things, some things out with the Christian mystery.
Let's see what they had to straighten out.
Bring it up.
Yep.
Bring it up.
Good.
That's a lot of letters, you know, that dude.
And it's too, you know, it's too Theodore.
And what does it say?
He says, you did a great job, Teddy.
You did a great job stifling those unspeakable teachings of the
Carpecrations.
You did a great job.
It's a secret.
It's a secret.
You did a great job.
Fantastic.
What?
Who are the Carpecrations?
Oh, they know how to party.
They know how to open nature.
They know how to open nature.
Boom, boom, boom, boom, love it.
Love it, here we go, here we go.
Let's get another text, it's overwhelming.
The nature's overwhelming.
Here we go, look at this, look at this bad boy.
Yeah, so this is also from the same Clement, right?
And he's saying, you know, while Mark was with Peter
doing their thing in Rome, he published,
it's like register on a grapho.
It's more like register, but I don't know.
I think publish is a good rendering.
He published the deeds of the Lord, the doings.
