Okay, okay, the mystic stuff.
He didn't betray it, right?
Now what's the problem?
Theodore wants to know, what's all this sexy stuff, sir?
And he's like, don't worry, daddy, don't worry, daddy.
It's okay.
He says, Jesus, talk about naked on naked.
What do you do naked on naked?
Theodore's like, why did he talk about naked with naked?
And it's okay, Clement says, look, look.
I mean, these are the leading Christians of the time, people,
right?
Look, it's okay.

That'll take the Roman heat off our backs.

Fantastic, fantastic, right?
We as initiates, silence.
You ever seen a Catholic priest try to silence someone?
Yeah, that's the energy that you're gleaning from that.
That's psychic vampirism.
You're gonna love that.
You're gonna have respect for the craft
that's able to prune the psychology

those sons of Zebedee, you know,
they were associates, it says, with Simon, okay?
Indicating some kind of guild thing.
This coin, Nonoi, is usually referring to tax collectors.
So it's tax farmers, harvesters, you could say.
So it's kind of like a scheme, right?
Right?
That's why Jesus is always telling them,
don't get scandalized, don't get caught, right?
Okay, here we go.
What does he say?
They're associates, you know, with Simon.
And Jesus says, don't be afraid, Peter, right?

You're gonna make me a zogron of men.
I'm gonna make you a zogron of human meat.

The Victorians put right here.
It's coming from Zoe and Aguero.
