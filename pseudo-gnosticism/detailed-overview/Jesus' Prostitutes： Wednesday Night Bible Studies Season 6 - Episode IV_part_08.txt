satarna, satwarna in old, old, old Greek.
Oh, beautiful.
What are they doing?
They're entering into those deep things.
When you are a Christian and you have not partaken
of the opening of the garden,
you do not have ionic life.
You have not entered death and been born again.
I'm gonna say this to those of you
because I know I have a special,
I have a special sting in my voice here.
You know, when you became born again,
that you were just flipping on this mental switch.
You didn't enter into death.
You weren't raised, revived from a state of death.
You didn't enter into the communion of the cop.
You are nowhere near a mystery.
You are closer to a philosopher
than you are an initiate into a mystery.
And that is the deepest insult
I could possibly hurl at Christianity.
Your mystery is absent.
There is more of your Christian mystery
in the excitement of a priest who is raping a child
than in all of your congregations
and all of your crazy preachers and teachers, all of them.
Your mystery is a mystery of the deep things of Satan.
Give me that last one.
Boom, look at this.
We talked about frogs.
I wanted to end it with a little bit of the frogs.
This is the chorus as we are going through death
back to life.
This is the chorus.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
Here we go.
Rise up.
See that first word?
Again, rise up.
Rise up, the chorus sings to you.
Rise up.
He has come
shaking in his hands that torch.
That torch that contains the ether of our souls.
Ether of our souls, the flocks.
Do the Greeks have complex words?
Yeah, they do.
Do you know what the ether of your soul is?
No, you don't.
I know you don't.
I've been reading this for years
and I can barely, barely get my mind conceptually
around what that is.
Just, you know, I give myself a little leeway
and just say, eh, well, you know, that's for smart people.
Okay, but when they get into the quantum physics,
you can't, it's hard to keep up.
It's hard to keep up.
I know there's those of you out there
this is not hard to keep up with.
Congratulations, you know, you get an award, right?
Smarty pants, right?
Okay, look at the chorus though.
They say, he's come, right?
And then it yake, yake, oh, yake.
Come morning star of our nocturnal initiation.
Come morning star.
Do you know who the morning star is?
The morning star is Satan.
Why is Jesus being called upon
as the great morning star, the great Satan?
It's because within the mystery,
that great Satan is the one who is Christed.
Yeah.
Yeah, if you had been there with Jesus,
wouldn't notice delegates, you know,
from the school came and they were like,
hey bro, take all this money and take your kid,
go to Egypt and get them all set up.
Yeah, he comes back.
He's more educated than anyone, right?
Do you think Judea, do you know why Jesus' parents
sent him to be educated outside of Judea?
Because Roman wealthy aristocrats
who somebody wanted to punish
would get assigned Judea.
Yeah, what they called Palestine.
Yeah, it's that bad.
Do you think they have an educational system there?
No, they don't have a, they're just catching up with Greek.
You notice there's not really literature
until they get the Greek in their hands.
Yeah, yeah, that's how it is, people.
