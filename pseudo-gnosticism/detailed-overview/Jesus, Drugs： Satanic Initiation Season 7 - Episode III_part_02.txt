Okay.
Take him down.
Every once in a while, you got to show the cross.
Just remember that.
Remember, every once in a while, show the cross.
Bring us back up to notice.
So what is this stuff?
This oxos, it's the oxos of death, baby.
Right?
It's prepared with hyssop.
Right?
It's given to him.
This stuff from this honey-dripping bread that induces the oracular voice, what is he
doing?
He's taking this stuff.
Right?
And when he took it, look at the third line from the bottom, for those of you who have
the least bit of doubt left over.
And when he received, when he took that pecan poton, that extremely sour, acidic potion,
the one even we address as the dipsatic brine, the dipsatic brine.
And when he had taken that, everything, all bets were off.
You thought Jesus died there and he's all like, ah, I'm bleeding.
I've gotten poked.
Where's my acacia?
Wait, what?
Where's my acacia?
Give me some of it.
Yeah, they didn't know this was coming.
Some of you will delight in this.
You'll be like, oh, I know.
And good, you know, good.
Welcome to the party.
Let's get down.
The punch bowls are over there.
Hit it.
Hit it.
Yeah.
Hit it.
Watch this guys.
Let's just enjoy this.
This is the last season.
Let's just, let's just enjoy it.
Thespesios.
Look at this.
What does it mean?
Divinely sounding, divinely sweet.
And look where you use it.
You use it in the context of songs.
Oh, that's nice.
Using the context of the sirens.
Oh, that's interesting.
I thought the sirens.
Have you heard the siren voice?
If you did, then you know what that or oracle bringing drug does.
Yeah.
You mean you can perceive music differently?
Yeah.
You can.
You should watch the bucket chorus.
Amazing.
And teach you everything.
It's like a traveling troop of educators who kick tail and sometimes kill people and
eat them.
They had one.
I'm just going to tell you this.
Just give me a second.
They had one in antiquity that was called the sphinx.
She went down the thieves.
She came, they came from the mountain.
It's a tribe of these now, right?
A tribe of mean ads.
And what do they do?
They rough, they rough the place up and demand tribute.
We want 12 virgin females and 12 virgin males.
The best you got.
Best looking.
We want dancers.
We want those.
Anybody who's got any influence, maybe some brains, we want them want their offspring.
And they're like, no, don't take it.
As a result, people would die of a strangulation.
That's what sphinx means in Greek.
Spingo.
Strangle you.
Imagine me.
Right.
I'm a sphinx.
I'm a strangler.
I got my hands around your throat.
And how do I, as her, how do I get my hands around your throat?
I do it with my bow.
Yeah.
I'll nick you with a poison that'll cause you to fall on the ground, stone stiff and strangle the death.
How do you like that?
Now are you going to give us the virgins?
Thanks.
We'll go away.
But in the meantime, we're going to enjoy some of this livestock.
No, no, we don't need sacrifices and barbecues.
We eat them raw.
Wow.
That's a healthy diet.
You guys talk about these old diets.
Forget paleo.
You got to go Bronze Age.
Get on your Bronze Age diet.
Eat that sheep.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Or person.
Person, if you catch your neighbor doing something they shouldn't do.
Bring justice to them.
Boom.
Take them into pieces.
You don't even have to carve.
You can pull them apart.
They said that.
I was talking once with a famous dude, Carl Rock, trying to figure out, is it an act that requires extra, you know, is it a feat of strength to pull apart a bull?
Can you pull apart a human being with your hands?
I think it can be done, but it helps if you are in a state of enthusiasm.
If you have that in theotic substance on board and you're pumping in a little bit of that mania.
Imagine.
Right.
Imagine.
These are the people we're talking about.
You thought you went, you go to church and you think this is a real mystery and you sit there mystery.
Everybody walks out.
You know how frigging satisfying is that you're never going to reach climax in a Catholic church.
Yeah.
Unless you're part of the priesthood.
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, but it's true.
It's true.
It's true.
Okay.
Let's keep going back to the source.
Give me another.
Give me the next one that was up there.
Look at this.
Look at this people.
Love.
Oh, here it is.
The deep sauce.
Here is what is according to notice is in Jesus's guts when he dies.
Are you ready?
Here it is.
