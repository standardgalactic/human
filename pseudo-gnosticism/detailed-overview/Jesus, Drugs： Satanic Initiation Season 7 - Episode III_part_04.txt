So they do, they crucify him.
And he's there when they crucify him, being offered, according to notice, that very communal
theriac, that thing to round out the right, that thing that balances the right.
But why?
Because his people know he's on it.
He's on it.
And what does he do?
He goes right into the death state.
Don't you know that's what we do, those of us who work by the power of Satan?
Don't you know that's what we do?
We put you into a death state and raise you back to life again.
And you walk around anew and it does something for you up here.
It gives you perspective that you didn't have before.
Well, he goes right into it.
He goes right into death.
Somebody asked me recently, they said,
Amin, do you think that the death is the, you know, how far did they go into it?
Was he sitting there?
I can't answer that except with what I've seen.
And I'm not going to BS you guys because I don't have anything to profit off of this.
Yeah.
They had drugs to put you into a state.
They call them Thona Sema, into a state that looks like death.
That you could have somebody come into the room and not be able to get a pulse.
Pulse is big, right?
These people are not stupid.
And they wouldn't, you know, they wouldn't be able to notice any visible signs of,
of, of living, especially breathing can make it look like death.
Especially breathing can make it look like you're not respirating at all.
Yeah.
There's using paralytics and stuff like that people, but these same drugs,
they have antidotes for that will bring you back.
So when Nona is talking about antidotes there,
realize that this is a sophisticated pharmacology.
This is polypharmacy.
I was just reading today about how to make grapes that will be poisonous.
I was like, wait, what?
Why would you want to do that in the first place?
All right.
But it turns out you make slits in certain places.
Sometimes you'll talk and not with just grapes either talking other vines,
how to turn the vine into a separate, you coat things, you make plasters.
You basically make poisons, give them to the plant to absorb.
The plant absorbs them and then produces the fruit.
I am the vine.
You are the branches.
Let's go to the next one.
Revolence and more Greek.
I love this.
Let's look at the bottom.
Oh, causing thirst.
Yes.
This is what we look at.
There's just a couple.
I just wanted you to see those of you were biologists.
This gets you.
Woo.
It's Twitter painted.
Look at the shapes.
That's a snake for you.
You know what that one causes?
That one causes corrosion.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
We get our words septic from it.
Oh, it's from the shapes.
Woo.
Look at the last one.
Deep sauce.
Right.
We know that's that viper.
We know that's that viper and you get some of that goodie inside of you.
You blow that up your backside.
Right.
Which is where they medically applicate it.
Right.
Woo.
You can go somewhere.
You can go somewhere.
Love it.
Mixed in.
Let's go to the next one.
What are some more drugs?
We got to look at some more of the stuff that Jesus.
I wanted to throw this out there because I didn't think people saw it.
I just wanted to show people here.
We have the logos in the very beginning and known us as telling us telling us about this
logo.
And I just want people to see.
I just want people to see a couple of things about this logo.
This is the Huios Amator.
You say what?
Yeah.
This is the son of God who has no mother.
This is the logos.
This is how the cult works, people.
You wanted to see Christianity.
Look at it.
Do you know why we take them out of, take them right out of her?
Hippocrates.
Can that seven month child live?
Oh, how many moons has it been?
Yes.
This is the one without the mother.
This is the son without the mother.
Oh, is that right?
This is who he's got to be.
Right.
The logos.
Fantastic.
This is what is floating in the cult around Jesus Christ.
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
Oh, here it is.
Amator.
Look, motherless, motherless.
Oh, it's so sad.
Who do you see there?
Here, for all of you cultist sick baggos.
Look at this.
Now kiss a deck.
Now kiss a deck.
Now kiss a deck.
Now kiss a deck.
We knew who we were looking for, didn't we?
Go to the next one.
Love it.
Next system.
Okay.
Here's a little quote for you.
I just wanted you to see Zoe.
Look at the second line.
Zoe, that's who we're talking about.
Right.
He is engendered in that logos.
Sophia is.
For those of you who've had some little bit of Gnostic training,
maybe you went to a Gnostic weekend group and everybody got crazy,
crazy high and did things to each other that sometimes you just
don't want to recall.
No, maybe not.
Not yet anyway, right?
But who knows?
Could be a future path.
What's going on here?
She is there.
