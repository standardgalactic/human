Zoe is that, you know, she's that one that's ingrained in that
source, right?
She's that.
Okay.
I just wanted you to see Zoe because we're not going to see it on
the purified side of the Christianity.
Later Christianity purified these sources.
They didn't want to see Zoe.
Right.
Now we couldn't take her out of the Garden of Eden.
Right.
We still got, we still managed to capture the book of Zoe.
Right.
People know about the tree of Zoe.
You didn't know Zoe had a tree?
Yeah.
The tree had a serpent in it.
Had a serpent who guarded it, gave her access.
Okay.
Let's go to the next one.
Look at this.
Yeah.
She's the all nourisher.
She is the all nourisher.
Do you know Zoe?
Do you know Zoe?
Zoe will crack.
Zoe will crack the ceiling of Christianity.
Yes.
It's who we were looking for in Edom.
We were looking for Zoe.
For those of you with ears to hear, we were looking for Zoe and
Edom.
Right.
And that's why the devil was like, no, it's not going to kill
you.
Right.
Eve was like that.
That MF her, she didn't say MF her, but you know, that's what,
because she said, he told us, you eat it.
It's going to kill you.
That one will kill you.
That was like, nope.
Nope.
You, you take this stuff and your eyes are going to be opened.
Yeah.
And you'll be as he is.
You'll know.
And Zoe was like, I dig it.
And she was like, Adam, and he was like, huh?
The devil's like, I don't know why she's with that guy.
You know what I mean?
Right.
Why was she with him?
Because she was that thing that you people translated now.
Bible scars.
It's Bible scar time.
Come here.
Gets my goat too.
Bible scars.
There you go.
Because you so distorted it.
Because you so screwed it up.
You created your artificial paradise.
And it was just, it was just a dream.
You said help mate, help mate.
More Bible scholars needed more.
Anybody else here want me to give it to the Bible scholars?
Help mate Bible scholars here.
This one's for the Baptist.
Baptist out there.
You translated.
This is help mate.
Help mate.
No.
This is that priestess that gives life.
This is she with the Awkawida.
If you'd asked me, Baptist, I'd have told you.
But now you have this on your bottom.
Yes.
I know why they do that now.
I know why the Balkans do that, right?
Because it brings you to a place.
It's invigorating.
It's good exercise.
It feels like the Lupercalia once again.
You ever go to the Lupercalia?
Right?
Oh, this kid went up.
He was absolutely, he was an Adonis.
He was an Adonis.
And he had that, he had that, that flail in his hand,
that, that strap.
And he went up and she, he went up to the girl that he was
just been following around for the last year.
And he hit her so hard with that.
And she tore open her breast and he just hit her over and
over.
And do you know why?
Why are they doing stuff like this?
It's goat stuff.
It's the tragedy.
It's the tragedy.
That gets my goat.
That gets my goat.
The tragedy that we have left out the tragedy out of our
society.
We've put a cross over it.
Now, now what we really, what we really worship is that guy
being crucified.
Right?
Let's go back to him.
You didn't know Jesus got stoned while he was dying, did
you?
Okay, though, because they had drugs of revival.
The Theriacs people, they had drugs that could bring you
back.
Don't you realize Jesus could have gone back to the tomb.
They could have taken him to a tomb.
Doesn't matter if they broke his legs.
He'd be in shit shape for a while.
But he wasn't dead yet.
He did get stabbed a little bit.
Last day he got aerated, right, and all the water.
He was drinking because he was thirsty.
How long do you think it would have taken?
The question is, could they have gotten him back and
revived before?
Now that, now that would be an interesting question.
And maybe that's why that little kid is there in the
tombs.
And then what is the kid wearing?
He's wearing ceremonial stuff.
Seriously?
Yeah, for what kind of ceremonies?
Death cults, you bonehead.
Death cults.
The mysteries are death cults.
They have to be death and resurrection.
If I can't put you into that state, see, ancient
Christians, they weren't...
Faith.
Your faith.
They were going through it.
They were being put into the death and brought out.
Because that's how the mystery functions.
