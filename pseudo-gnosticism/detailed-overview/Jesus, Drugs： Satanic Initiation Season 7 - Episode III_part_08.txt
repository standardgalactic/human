Wake up, Jesus.
Sabak's phone, you said.
I got your Sabak's phone right here.
We take joy.
They take joy in the crucifixion.
Can you believe that?
Look at them.
The angels that are watching.
Look at these people.
Sick.
These people are sick.
Sick.
Right.
I want a huge crucifix with a dead Jesus on it, but I don't want him dead, dead.
I want a Jesus who was entered into that death state who was drugged like the one that was there.
Yeah.
I want the actual historical Jesus.
I want the one who probably died because they poked him.
If those, isn't it, isn't it odd?
We can enjoy this about the crucifix.
If those soldiers, those Romans, because the Romans were like, time to break legs.
What time is it?
Time to break legs, boys.
How do you work a job like that?
Seriously.
How do you work a job?
Right?
I'm going to go, well, that one's still alive.
Look, he's still groaning.
Break his legs.
Right?
You get a big hammer and you bust his legs.
It's the precision, the precision of the pain and the precision of that masochistic tendency
that urge and the fulfillment, the urge of the wolf.
Right?
The urge of that one who was the paideraste.
Right?
That crazy thesalian with all those drugs.
You know what they do to their students.
Right?
We know the most prominent of them was a prince called Yasus, Yasan.
Excuse me.
Jason also, aka where Jesus comes from.
Right?
This is part of a tradition, people.
This is not, this stuff is interconnected.
It's, these people were not born in vacuums.
They interacted with each other and this spread and this spread.
Let's go.
Let's go back to the call.
I want to see him.
I want to see what's going to happen.
Right?
Yeah.
Look, anything.
Look at the second line.
You see that word?
Sabasma.
I just want you to focus on that because this, this power, this power is going to stand there.
It's going to pose itself to God and to everything that is sabasma.
What is sabasma?
That's what you're supposed to be doing Christians on Saturday, but you don't.
Oh, sorry.
On Sunday.
You switched it on Sunday.
You're supposed to be doing that on Sunday, but you don't.
Right?
There is no sabah.
There is no sabah.
Do you know what your savior screamed from the cross?
Sabah.
The name of a God in his mouth while he was dying.
Yeah.
And not just any God, but God used by the lace days.
Some of you tell your, tell Saint John.
Remember, he's 10 to 12 and tell him, look into his little eyes and tell Saint John like Jesus did.
Yeah, marriage sucks.
You know, let me tell you about this other avenue.
There are these Unix that are born Unix.
There are these Unix that are become Unix.
There are these Unix who follow the kingdom of God.
Don't you want to follow the kingdom of heaven?
Peter.
Who am I, Peter?
Who am I?
You know who I am.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're gangster G.
That's who you are.
Yeah.
You say it should be a J.
Gangsta G.
Now let's go to the final source.
This is too much fun and I know I'm having way too much fun, but thank you for letting me in this final season for a few more weekends have a lot of fun.
Wow.
We're going all the way down the bottom.
Look at that.
No, I don't want to jump to the, because there's a couple of goodies here.
Let's keep going.
What was next after that one?
Yeah.
Okay.
Look at second Thessalonians again.
Right.
How, how is all of this happening?
It's, it's happening through Satana, right?
Or Satuana or Saturnus.
This is all happening through that Saturnian age.
Right.
This is how we're bringing it about.
That's why the connection that we have to Satan.
You mean Satan is older than Jehovah?
Yes.
Of course.
Of course he is.
Who'd you expect had the best job anyway?
Yeah.
Guard this stuff.
Okay.
Right.
Go.
Let's go to the next one.
Yeah.
Um, and then that person that on almost, yeah, they'll be revealed, right?
Whom the Lord Jesus on Nellie, he's going to annihilate him.
He's going to annihilate him with his what?
If you're a magus, what are you going to annihilate anyone with?
You know, we are.
We're workers in wind, right?
It says those creepy magi workers in wind, workers in wind.
Yeah.
And the breath of his mouth, baby.
That's how he's going to do it.
That's how he's going to do it.
And when's it going to happen?
It is epiphania, man.
When he shows up, right?
And the Christians are like, yeah, he's going to show up and he's going to kill everybody who's
not a Christian and the place will be running with blood.
Show me Christ crucified.
Show me.
Show me the crown on his head, Mel.
Show me his blood.
Oh, I love his blood.
I love the blood of Jesus.
