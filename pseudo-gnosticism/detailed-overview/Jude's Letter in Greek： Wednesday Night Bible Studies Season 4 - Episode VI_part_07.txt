of a brother for certain people have snuck in these are people who were
indicted long time ago as the assa base as those who have no Saba those who have
no Saba you coming in wait what side are we on we're on the side of the Saba yeah

get these things to work without some form of worship we know that the universe
is based on that we know it's based upon some fabric of information yeah yeah
transferring that information just it's just communication don't something make
a big deal but so now he's writing them these people have snuck in right and you
know it's been written down that the you know what are they doing they're going
they're creating a cell yeah they're creating the wantonness is anybody
wanting out there can we bring that any further forward than Victoria at England

maintaining that divide she was maintaining it historically and you guys
shot it down you guys shot it down no one of the oracles died yeah that's it
that's it no more for you this is sad it makes me sad let's keep reading because
this is it's gonna you know kind of get crazy he says he wants to remind them you
know he says knowing that at one time at one time Jesus Christ took you out of
Egypt wait what who did Jesus did
Jesus Christ took some people out of Egypt yeah and what did he do after he
took him out of Egypt on this excursion what did he do he killed him wait I'm
sorry say it stop he did what he did what he killed him why because they
turned around decided his junk did not fly with them yeah so he killed him all
welcome to Jesus Christ if you didn't know that this was in Jude it's because
every sermon that you go look up right now popular ones that get 60,000 hits at

you listen to Jill Osteen number one because it's great great entertainment
but these are historical data points that you can trace what's happening now
and predicts what's happening in what's you expect to happen in the future yeah
it's a very oracular process it's fantastic but you have to you have to go
to the elements for it so that's what they're doing they're diving in these
people that come up into their agape feast did you know the Romans were
arresting Christians for agape feasts that he's talking about where we're
going to and you say why um and why would you bring that up because I find it

they have to break up certain gatherings certain religious gatherings for
treasonous activity and for mothers having sex with their children to the
Romans that was completely off right you want to have your orgia you want to
have your orgies your religious performances you know where the arches
are you know where the temples are where all of that stuff is done right
