this hut on the place yeah she brought Latin so that those people could write
their own language imagine her you know what they call her they call her the
Roman muse carmenta carmenta the Roman muse and what what was she in
Algeria what did they first do what was their cult this oldest of oldest of
cults right this oldest of cults of the muse what what did they bring what did
they bring they brought that oracle they brought that oracle and with it they
built civilization with it they built civilization and they did so as what was
her occupation I'm sorry I couldn't hear that what was her occupant yeah midwife
midwife the drugs always go back to the midwives right they always go back to
the midwives the oldest ones so we have cult people that is designed by and for
midwives to create civilization this is the stew of the Bronze Age this is the
stew and this is what we're seeing reflected through these sources even
through this guy yeah even through Jude even through Jude now we were just with
Jesus right Jesus was bringing people out of Egypt and then they turned against
them so Jesus killed them all right it's what Jude says don't look at me and say
Moses right we all know his name comes from the muse yeah who do you think has
the snake on the pole right what you're telling me Judaism is a Bronze Age
mystery cult yes yes Judaism developed from older cultures as far back as the
Calculithic Pulaskians performing the ritual yeah which turns out involves a
lot a lot of drugs and it ends up staining the language with all the drugs
that it's using right fantastic okay let me just there was a couple of more
things I don't want to take up too much of your time I just wanted to bring it
together and I wanted you to note that our warning is you know the angels right
so you've got Lucifer who is the most beautiful right and he takes down with
him a third right a third of the other angels with him and everybody knows
that here where you and I are this is Satan's belongs to him yeah belongs to
him and even that little even that guy Michael take that down for a second this
is one of the most disgraceful right acts he is a who am I am I the accuser
tonight I am it was about the body of Moses it was about the body of Moses and
the funny thing was heaven didn't get possession of it because Michael was
sent to do a job and didn't do it why Michael because Michael was scared brah
when you have angels and your enforcers who are scared you got problems brah
dragon dragon fears nobody but Medea fears nobody but that Queen dragon fears
nobody but that Queen that he serves is that nice oh that's nice I love that I
love that and that's why you get it preserved over time you get the mystery
preserved over time so I want to bring that out and I want to point you to the
way of Cain yeah I want to point you to the way of Cain and along the path to the
way of Cain is that place called Sodom and Gomorrah Sodom and Gomorrah and
you'll be watching the sermons on Jude and you won't get this you won't get it
at all notice that he said what kind of people are these that come into your
assemblies who's their way and how do they how do these people get in there
all right what kind of people are they well he tells us to the kind of people
that enter into dream oracles yeah what these are people who get vision oh these
are people who are going through those rights yes yes people the mystery of
Anomia is in operation right it is working there are people who are doing
it and this group is fighting that group yeah you have an opposition it's
gorgeous the cult history is fantastic of antiquity right and you can't talk
about Jesus unless you talk about cult history right dude had the titles right
all the titles mm-hmm same ones same ones that they're using in the great
mother cult where we end up with the child castrated fantastic it must have
been a great time can you imagine I honestly I just want to step aside before
we just mentioned the way of Cain and then we're gonna we're gonna jump because
it's a lot and I don't I value your time can we just look at for a second the
fact that these ways are ways involving body fluids and rituals and sex they
were getting all sort of oils somebody was screaming about the consecration
oils and somebody else said hey do you know there's a formula for this thing
dude I cannot remember all the consecration oils that I saw the recipes
for the ones that I like are the ones of the priestesses Aphrodite use you know
what they got in there they got things to stop you from getting sick they got
what they got stuff that will kill what you get down there in your reproductive
zone yeah the matrix of existence people say you know it's looking how your
language is look look at the uterus right like what is there how do they
