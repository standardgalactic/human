perceive the uterus right you're gonna see how they end up treating women right
and nobody cares about why does nobody care about those women around the Black
Sea why does nobody care about those women around the Black Sea I don't get it
they were creating everything they had the knowledge the knowledge that burned
in the Bronze Age filtered down through these genius women who were using
chemicals to transform people to keep people alive during childbirth to heal
disease and to take you from an everyday person and turn you into a born-again
cultist with a vision that you can never release you can never release once
you've been there imagine if I came to you and said and you said how was it and
I'd have to say since I'm talking to you I'd have to say wow I mean this whole
death thing scared scared me right but once I was there and saw what I saw the
whole resurrection was like put it into a place that makes me no longer fear what
is going on in life right and that is what Jude's contention is they have run
after the nature look what they're doing people they're running after the nature
do you know that the mystery the religions that created Judaism and
Christianity and Islam did you know those monotheistic side rivulets all come
from a place where nature is central you must have a great mother if you don't
you don't belong here right somebody get the we got another Addis we got another
Addis right he must undergo the transformation imagine if I don't know
if you could see a group of women with this power and remember the archers are
the at the time that's the unbeatable technology right and those women who are
on the horses around the Black Sea those women are ferocious they have to kill
three people before they can have a situation where they'll produce offspring
nobody produces offspring unless you got three and if you want to get rid of your
guy you know that's up to you do you see the power there do you see the power
there and from that they built the society that is buried underneath the
Christian one that was built on top yeah it's absolutely gorgeous it's
absolutely gorgeous yeah and what I think that we're gonna have to do is find
these texts in their native original habitats so that we can put together the
broader picture of what is coming and what we need to do just keep bear this
in mind the great Etruscan civils worked under a system that viewed that
central authority or God if you will as a woman who possessed the knowledge of
the drugs she was able to control her own body hence her own destiny yeah isn't
that amazing makes you think could they have made those advances without those
daughters I don't think they could have made the advances with as much of the
drugs that I've seen in the text I don't think this is you're gonna have to have a
whole bunch of people involved over a whole long time yeah you're gonna have
to have tried and true especially when you're talking about antidotes right
and bringing somebody back from a snake venom right exposure fantastic mmm what
if we could send ourselves there you know where I'm going all right I want
to watch one more time I want to watch one more time what we watched at the
beginning about the women within the Southern Baptist convention and what is
going on because that is a great thermometer of those who have snuck in
who have submitted are you a doulos are you a slave have you submitted to the
yoke yes yes I dedicate this to you in your unsatisfaction
yeah
but please don't talk to me like I got a mess up to you got one judge you don't
need to please do I feel sorry for you oh that's gonna be a little hard to do
I don't the back roads inside the forbidden zone
followed by it goes growing up alone
time to bring her back right time to bring her back and to show him what it
is yeah thanks for those of you who've been on the way to Aphrodite thank you
