Keep going
Next one
Oh, bam
We're gonna get through these fast tonight people
There's a couple of
Before we get here, by the way
Everybody, since we're here
And you see the Canatus
Sitting in front of you
Right?
You see the Canatus
You saw him
I usually don't refer to the
You know, to our thumbnail
But tonight
We're looking right in the face of that boy
Who was with Jesus Christ
And he was arrested in a public park
And the kid was naked
He was naked at the time
Right?
With just this bandage on his private parts
What's happening Jesus?
Jesus is screaming
I'm not a trafficker
Yeah
Where are those boys?
Where are those boys?
There's three of them right there
Right?
Which one of them did he give the
Up into?
It was the old one
Yeah
That older teenage guy
What was his name?
Peter
I think it was
Yep, let's keep going
They called him the rock
Right?
The enforcer
How do we get here?
We got here from the Filtra
Right?
What are the Filtra?
There's those
Pharmaca
Those drugs people
That lead us to Philean
They literally cause us
To passionately crave Philea
Do you know what I mean?
I'll give you something
And when I give you that substance
You will be pushed
How do they translate Philea?
It can be kisses
It can be kisses
It can be kisses or it can be
Hardcore intercourse
Yeah
That state of love
Isn't that nice?
These kisses can be brought to you
By the drugs
So we're sitting here
In antiquity, right?
Put it down
Put it down
Put it down
Whatever it is
Dinner
Put it down
We're sitting here in the park
And we're with the Canatus
The one that was with Jesus
When he was arrested
He's got the bandage on
His private parts
And what is he doing?
He's getting drugs
He's getting drugs
To make him
Sexually aroused
You mean they're drugging people?
I just gave you two direct examples
One with Zeus
And one
With Jesus
And what do we do?
We turn the kid into a cup
The cup bear is the one
Who has that glane
And we're going to push
The poison through the glane
We get a combo
And that combo will keep you alive
Okay
All right
You wanted to see it
We got more on the Canatus here
Keep going to the next one
Was that Hermes?
I had to summon him
Look at his people
What are the pharmacos we're talking about?
In this particular commentary
He's saying hey
Or you know
Scolias's work is not really a commentary
It's just like a helpful way
Of explaining the poetry
Like the poetry is being studied
So in the Selenian mountain
What happens?
There are these people there
And they have
These instruments that belong to
Medea and to Cersei
And they're things that they use
To prepare drugs
They're used to prepare drugs
For those of you who thought
Medea was myth
These are people talking about
The reference to the instruments
That they're using in their drug
Making crafts
Their toxicological work
Right
They've got them
They've got those instruments
Keep going
Beautiful
Next one
Remember the Neoniscos
That's with Jesus
I'm going to give you
Just a little bit of whiff of that boy
I want you to come close
To the kid
The kid that was naked
With the bandage on his private parts
I want you to come close to him
From the throne
I want you to reach out
And I want you to say
What is this historically?
Young man, young man
What is this thing?
Now, you know
What is he according to Ezekius?
He's a napios
He's a napios
Seriously?
That makes me feel bad for him
You know what he just said?
He said he's an idiot
He's somebody who can be mentally controlled
Like a young boy
Oh, you mean I shouldn't have called him a young man?
No, because he's not a young man
He's a boy
He's with a napios
He's with somebody who is not mentally finished
Haven't cooked yet
Give me the next one
What is this?
What is napio?
Just for those of you
Because I get people telling me
Hey, no, this kid
He's 30
He's got a beard
And he's got a wife and kids
No, no, napia
Or micropaedia
Those are tiny kids
Those are tiny kids who cannot yet understand
How to defend themselves
If you give those kids drugs
As a lace-dace
You can sexually
Mold them into prostitutes
Conveyors of a religious form of communion
Known as the mystery
Are you kidding me?
Is that what Jesus was doing with the boy?
Is that what Jesus was doing with the boy?
Now, everybody who says,
Neoniskos is a 30-year-old
Right?
Now, look at how they're defining the words
All you do, you seminarians, you Bible historians
All you scholars of things having to do
With the Dead Sea Scrolls
