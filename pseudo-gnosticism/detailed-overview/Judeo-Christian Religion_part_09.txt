It's wrapped around that kid's private parts
That's a poison
It will kill you
It's all those witches, man
It's all those witches
You see that thing sitting there?
Sitting there?
That thing is described in the Aristophanes
And he compares it to a penis
Yeah
And it's a joke between a wife and her husband
She wants to give him some
Yeah
And he's like, nope
Interesting
Let's go back
Remember we're in Cyprus
So what happens?
Go back to the last one
We're in Cyprus
So ladies, guess what
This weekend
You get to go out
And celebrate Adonis
With a total stranger
That you pick out
And Mr. Husband
That you have at home
He's not going to say a single thing
Do you know why?
We have kicked around
We ladies of city
Have kicked this place around so much
We have real power
We have real power
Isn't that nice?
Wouldn't it be nice?
Let me just ask this
Before we finish
We're talking about the Canidis all night
We have to
Because that Canidis is with Jesus
And it's terms like Canidis
That we can't
We're not going to be able to translate
Into the Hebrew
It's not going to be able to make it to that level
Okay, I'm sorry
It's okay
You're dealing with a language
It's got 1.5 million
And you can't
8,000
Eat your cupcake, Tommy
You know what I mean?
It's okay
Daddy will be home soon
It's getting late
It's already 8 o'clock
Go to bed
Go to bed, right?
Me and me and Greg
We're going to stay up tonight
Me and Greg
Alright
Now, could you feel it?
Go to that very last one
Give me that last last slide
We'll end on this, people
Just some a little bit of
Serious gift
Look at this
Semelos
What is Semelos?
Some of you will recognize the name
Semeli
This is Hasekius again
Thank you, Hasekius
For your definitions
This is Semeli
Who is Semeli?
Semeli is the mother of Dionysus
Alright, Hail Satan
The mother of Dionysus
And what does Hasekius tell us?
The great name of the virgin
Remember who she is, Semeli
I'll just remind you
She's the virgin who slept with Zeus
Who slept with God
Do you know her?
Do you know a virgin who slept with God?
Is that something?
And we're just here to prove
That that happened
Look at the name
Look at the name
What's under the name of Semeli?
What's under the same root?
It's using the same root
Kochlias
Kochlias
That's the purple people
That's the purple, you know, in Euripides
In the opening lines of the Bacchai
Says that he was birthed in the lightning
He had that oistress
He got that oistress from Semeli
From Semeli, the child
Dionysus is the child of she
Who founded the Bacchic Rite
Isn't that gorgeous?
Isn't that gorgeous?
Welcome to the Bacchic Empire
Welcome
It's time to go
And that really gets my goat
Because I wanted to tell everybody
Everybody
Anybody who's kept a...
Stop
I mean, keep it
Just wait
With all due reverence
Penelope
Show us the cross
Give us the cross to behold
Let us know that its power emanates
From what it covers
And it covers a multitude of sin
A multitude
Thank you, Penelope
Rock on
Thank you for coming tonight
Everybody, you can see that I'm still not giving you
a chance for arm and you
It's still under construction, man
It's under construction
It's coming
But it will be something fantastic
And I appreciate everybody
Who's interested
Everybody, right?
Anyone who wants to enlist
I appreciate
Thank you
Yeah, there's this...
There's this...
Yeah, there is
There is
Hail Satan, Rob Street
The stain
Yes
Do we have a song about an immortal stain?
I think we need one
Thank you, everyone who is waiting, though
Seriously, and I will be pushing that forward
Please keep a lookout for Danny Jones
Who totally rocks
And, okay
I think it was gorgeous
Absolutely gorgeous to be able to sit with him
So, I appreciate that
Thank you for coming tonight
And you know what it's time for
It's time to Hail Satan
I'm on the wheel on the room
When she walks in
I'm on the harp and the bongo drums
Like the magic gin
In the morning
I blaze weed
Get behind the mule and push
Someone's gotta grow this sage
And frankincense
So they can get high
Cornucopia from the garden orchard
Bobo rigatoni
Sipping wine
At the Barca Lades
Have a little taste
High off the contact
Sounds nice
But perfume is the intoxication
The mule sings to me
Whisper little things
Hold my heart so deep
Dancing in a dream
