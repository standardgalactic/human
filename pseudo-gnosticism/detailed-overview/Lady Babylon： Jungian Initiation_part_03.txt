current cult language I mean like ancient mysteries cult language because their cult is such a loaded
term that to use it people get their defenses up really quickly so if we talk about what's
happening in the mystery cults these are small my my projection right are small groups of people
that build their their small religious spiritual practices around some kind of an alternate state
of consciousness or knowledge and they engage in certain practices like chanting or restricting
food intake or going into a cave or taking drugs or doing these really intense practice pain was
involved uh what we know is that those those kinds of practices tend to destabilize the the the the
narrative of identity and ego that's consistently um uh that's the consistent lens we see through
as humans and so if if we destabilize that then some other form of awareness tends to come on
and and in our culture we don't really have a landing pad for that except in the counterculture
back to eslan I mean there's there are folks who've been studying this stuff for a long long time
but it's hidden and it's it had to be hidden okay I'm gonna feel like we've got a couple threads
that are hanging out there but I want to be I want to be mindful no no so you're not promising
you're not promising any cult initiations but you are working a magic that is uh is a revival
it's part of a renaissance of ancient um human magic um bronze age bronze age and and beyond and
I heard a really good so I can I can at minimum I heard a really I interviewed somebody recently
and we're still working on when it's going to come out his name is edward beaver and he's a um
he's I had this book here he wrote a book called magic in the modern world and his other book that
I interviewed him on is um the realities of witchcraft witchcraft and popular magic in early modern
europe edward beaver and when I asked him the question um what what is magic or what is uh
well I just said that what is magic we were talking about witchcraft and he just said magic is a way of
tuning your uh nervous system and I while I think that's a reduction right like I get it
that I don't want to necessarily say hey let's reduce this to um to simply our physiology I also
understand that that given the nature of we're not a split we're not a we see things in dual form
and this is certainly a dual existence but we're a unified experience and so
there's something about being in the body and recognizing the ways in which this body behaves
and how we really do need to work with our nervous systems and if and I think that's magic and I
think that's certainly therapeutic to to help somebody work with the magic of their own nervous
systems and therefore what the way we do that is through ritual through ceremony through conversation
through relationship through modeling through group practices um through paying attention to a
master and kind of watching what they do always live this way part of what I think is developing
is the recognition that we actually need to have these practices we have a religious and spiritual
nature as human beings and we've not I mean religion is relegated to some some guy in the
clouds with like a staff that is going to like bolt you with lighting like that's that's not what
religions look at John why do you think it is that that image of the mother is so powerful
and you're in your exposure to the depths of the human mind in your practice and your therapy
what do you think it is about that mother image and is it possible that that is what the histories
are that the mysteries are drawing upon when you are initiated into the great mother or when you see
the queen of the underworld rise in front of you is there something about that power that maternal
would you call it an archetype I don't know can you just address because I would actually say and
is this may be counterproductive in your endeavor but I would say it's in language like the queen
of the underworld has a certain time stamp on it and that's one thing like we are talking about
I like the practice where we actually can't use the name God we can't say Yahweh it's something
beyond our comprehension so when we're talking about these kinds of forces we're we're talking
about forces that are beyond our comprehension and so we I think we need to be careful how we
conceptualize with that said I like to think in terms of layers of this kind of consciousness
because on the one level the mother is you know the ground of being the the the the the the raw
potential of creation the the the the formless through which we're formed you know and and that's
not we're using words to describe those kinds of images sometimes we can get lost and and believe
that the image is what that points towards the image points us towards a reality it is not the
reality so you also have on that thread you have from this kind of cosmic raw potential
undefinable formless empty nature all the way over to your personal experience with mothering
and so this this theory is that we all have this kind of material or maternal structure
this matrix through which we operate and and then our personal experience is a mothering color
the experience of that archetype or that image and so okay John when does that mother figure
when does she transform into the harlot or into the horror when does the lady Babylon
who provides the cup of her communion which is similar or which is a fluid substance brought
by her porneia when does that mother become the lover at what point do we grow up John
as boys being initiated into the great mother at what point do we enter which we grow into the
state of sexual beings I mean is this a place that you can work with therapeutically oh yeah
