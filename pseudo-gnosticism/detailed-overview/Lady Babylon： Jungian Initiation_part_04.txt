sure I mean this is this is an important transition and and in in number of ways for both young
young boys and girls the mother is the not only first love but original
original potential through which that child is formed and out of her the child is born you know
like that's the kind of the nature of all this and so those threads are interwoven in our existence
in ways that are really powerful so to speak of mother especially when you are in a culture
that is devoid of mother the the my projections onto certain militant structures it's a very masculine
male dominated landscape and so I think I think on some level when you have that tendency in the
outer world that way in this instance that mothering part goes to the underworld and she's
played out in unfortunate ways and oftentimes he's never able to recognize what he didn't get from
his mother or what he still yearns from his mother or what he still needs from his mother because
to stay tied to that is in some ways to stay a boy or a child so so there are there are ways our
culture hasn't really established the necessity for us to become the individual not the individual
but the individuated person and identity that we were created to be on some level so that brings
on you you mentioned boys and initiations that brings on rob rob introduce yourself and we're
going to give you here's the game if you do this right you get an all expenses paid trip
to elizia you get to be experience the initiation and you get to see her rise that's what that's
what we're going to do um rob tell us about yourselves rob is the neophyte um so introduce
yourselves undress get metaphorically and show us show us who you are and this this mogus that
i've got with me today dr john price um he is going to help you he's going to help you to discover
yeah your your rebirth um please introduce yourself rob he already has thank you thank
you i'm honored to be here thank you john it's it's it's great it's great to be in your company
thank you uh you are it's all your fault essentially it's all your fault while i'm here i'm so
why i'm here today and it it's it's been a fantastic journey it started with you
and um then it went into an email then it went into a few comments then it went into
pretty much a research study that's lasted until today and hasn't ceased until today
until today i'm still receiving books related to the topic that you all talk about and um
that's my story essentially is i've been persistent enough to get in touch and try and
tap into the the culture what you're brewing what you the the kind of um the kind of collective
consciousness what you what you're gathering with your channel with everything you're doing
and that is one thing what is fantastic but then the next thing is aiman himself
which is a standout it's a standout podcast in my opinion that that podcast with aiman there are
brilliant podcasts but that that podcast with aiman is is profundity isn't it it's it's beyond
what you would normally expect to hear on a podcast so i paid him i paid him to say that don't
don't take that no i paid him to say that i i completely grabbed my attention tell us what
tell us what the tell us what the queen's pretty council and i'm talking about your
one of your departed queens of your great island tell us you've been listening to the
to the bits on the nazis and the the reformation yeah we all we all know that this is an element
that we're having to deal with now and so you know it it may be a trauma that john is able to
help unwind and ultimately i'm interested in could we put evangelicals into this initiation
in order to bring them to a point of rebirth can i i want to jump sorry to jump in on it i
really i want to say something as we go into this because this is important if we're talking about
mothering we need to understand the kind of energy energetic directions of where the wound
happens because if we all have a fundamental need that's essentially empty right i just have this
vessel this this riverbed that needs to be filled and it needs to be filled by mothering but i'm
going to experience mothering in primarily on a spectrum of one of two directions either too much
or not enough and and that's therein lies kind of the the rub which is the ways in which we get
these dynamics that are played out in our individual lives and our collective lives so i
i just felt remiss if we didn't kind of position what where the wound occurs because i can be
wounded by too much nurturing if i don't have any structure if i'm always met always love this is
back to the story of the buddha right like in the buddha the father was saying hey i'm going to keep
you here uh sex drives and rock and roll are going to keep you um in love and you know present and
he says i got to leave that was too much of a good thing right too much good food too much sex
too much pleasure too much not enough same kind of dynamic we're going to get hurt and the that
that thread that initial kind of essence will play itself out unconsciously over time so i
sorry to jump in but i wanted to at least plant that seed and rob dude great great to see you on
on this random sunday thanks john no no problem button in that that is what what you've said
that is uh it's it's quite profound it is what what i've um gathered from what you're saying is
i i often think about the womb you know and the the weight of being carried in that womb
for nine months to to any any soul any person who's within that womb that that's the place
where you first start receiving your your signals from your environment and you start forming any
