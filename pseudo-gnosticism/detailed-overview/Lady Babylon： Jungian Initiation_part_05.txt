in a certain way i was i was thinking about this not just just yesterday as i was thinking about
when i when i when it when the sperm meets the egg and you what you what you start is a war
essentially how it's described in the in a midwifes magazine i read about pre clamping
what you start is a war essentially where genes are knocking out other genes and the the fight
is from both sides both sides a fight in each other to win the whatever that gene or that cell
is going to be and the important part of it is there has to be a balance there has to be that
ideal balance between the two genes hitting against each other because if you don't have
that balance you you develop pre-eclampsia where one gene is becoming dominant over the other
therefore it's a worrying thing and sometimes you have to you have to be taken in early and
perhaps give birth early but that's the the very start the the the inception and the
conception of the human what's going to develop into what we're discussing and
what what what what what what becomes a nazi essentially but that's the mothering aspect
and that womb aspect is something we all seem to have a craving to go back to and maybe maybe
there's something in that with the caves with the with the need to go back into a womb environment
to find ourselves again it's just so interesting you use the the womb as the as that image you
know because because we i'd like to offer up another the additional piece to this which is this
kind of psychoanalytically based idea that we are these beings that will repeat or seek out
what's happened in our history we are a collection of our histories that continue to play themselves
out the other side to this is something very interesting which is emerging with the great
mother that there's a an urge inside of us to connect with not so much moving backwards into
the womb but ultimately surrendering to our own death and recognizing that this human existence
will merge with the great mother to use that language system once again and that we have we
are teetering between the balance of that initial womb experience when we're born into form you
born into form you know and at conception to when we are dissolving this physical form
and merging with the great mother at the end of our lives and so there's and and and that's the
the pool that we're operating in all the entire time interestingly enough so there's something so
deep about this you know totalizing matrix that we're in so if rob is a if rob is an ancient Greek
we'll say he's a thration we're making thration and he brings up the womb and you talk about death
and i read a Byzantine manuscript on the the uterus and why it has the names that it does nobody
ever reads the medical stuff i don't know why but um that it's compared to a tomb and it's considered
to be that that that dark emptiness that dark emptiness from which the great mother brings life
and so right right away it's cyclical what would you say then to rob if rob is sitting there and
he's your thration and you're the priest and you've got him in california strip naked because i i've
you know i know you can do that i know you have the power to do that and he's you know in our
conceptual world he is an initiate so he's gone through the beginnings of the fasting and the
proper health you were talking about health care before you know because what you what you're doing
is you're reconstructing that temple of Asclepius yeah so he's been there for a few days incubating
and you've got him now and you're talking to him while he's under the influence and he comes up
with the womb what do you where do you go from there make it visible for us so we can see how the
hypnosis works on on rob would you would you mind doing that i totally although i gotta say it's so
situational and uh because victor frankle said something that i like very much in his uh book
man search for meaning that if you do the same thing with any one patient if you do the same
thing with two patients you've messed up with one of them and so there are there are real i'm very
mindful about any systematized manualized approaches for healing which is radically
the individual right then excuse me so with that said that i can't really um i can't really
acknowledge the intervention to use a blunt term um because i don't know necessarily what
the diagnosis is now so let me again with that said i'm not giving medical advice here
but uh the first thought that i had if rod if you're in the middle of that then my job is to get
the fuck out of the way you know like there are there are times when i i think like when i used
to play in bands you know i used to love the i still love the musicians who myself included
who tastefully know when to play and when not to play i mean you surround yourself by people who are
um incredibly trained musicians that know how to play single you know maybe a couple of notes
in a very tasteful way and it supports the song and so as a clinician or as this priestly class
that you're talking about almond i think a lot of times it's knowing when to back up and when to let
because the the great mother has wisdom that i don't my job is to create an opportunity for
you to connect with the great mother so you're you're causing your patient or your person that
you're initiate you're causing them to be possessed just like they were rob would you say it's fair
that that john is trying to possess you with that power that he's in focusing you know bring it is
watch watch now he's going to say some things to you that are going to enhance that right and it
brings it out how do you feel as the initiate going through this assuming you know uh you know
