you know like we we talk a lot about the act of this you know of course vulnerability but
less than vulnerability i maybe not less than i think i think probably more than the word
vulnerability in all our various trappings with that word and all the associations but there's a
certain um desire for you as the patient let's just use this dynamic for a moment you the patient
to consistently work and be reminded to be authentic really true about with the energies that are in you
now that's that's different like what if the energies in you are rage what if the energies in
you are embarrassment and shame what if the energies in you are um you think that i'm judging
you in the moment and you feel agitated and like your your fantasy is you want to tell me to fuck off
well what if you and i've established enough a relationship for you to say i really want to
tell you to fuck off right now john and the way that i meet you is to say well why don't you rob
where does that come from help me understand let's draw that out a little bit let's let's pull this
part of you that's not able to be expressed because you can't do that in proper polite culture
but let's bring out that essence and so that we can look at it experientially as opposed to just
keeping it in some intellectual prison repressed and it comes out when you are driving down the
road and somebody cuts you off and you go into a fucking rage fit and you're beating on your steering
wheel because somebody just moved their car in front of you and it's like that's not about what
that's about that's about something else that you've been repressing or carrying and so
part of my vision of this work that first of all first of all has as a center point love
love and connection and when you can love and try to engender and bring out more of the individual
than they even know they're capable of because we love because we need love because we need connection
because we've been hurt in the areas where we need connection typically it's relational dynamics
that heal the wound trust begins for first step you're all you're talking about other I mean
expertise America needs you Dr. John Price America needs you right with no I mean literally they
do I mean you you treat the sick and in terrible terrible traumatic situations what if America needs
that you know that treatment that you're talking about going back to this mother and I mean can
you start can you start treating you know can you if Rob hangs out say Rob hangs out and
the wrong the wrong club and ends up flying symbols that are you know manifest his own
sociopathy can you treat can would you be treating Nazis in the future would you be
treating white nationalists will you be treating people who will stand against you as a as a
therapeuticion for lack of yes I mean the answer is absolutely because hurt people hurt people
and and now there is an element of somebody has to have had an experience that changes their
orientation because when they're stuck in an ideology they're they're living a life caught by
that thought pattern that's not that's not who they truly are that's a surrogate that's a so so it
reminds me of what I learned years ago like something like 80 percent of gang members are
fatherless and when we seek out those very masculine identified hierarchical structures
they tend to provide us what we need on a deep level but we find what we need because of what
we didn't get we find that's what we need because we didn't get it somewhere and so if we didn't
have healthy initiation into our own and now this is important it's not initiation into some kind of
institution it's initiation into your own inheritance as a human being into your own existence
into your own truth into your own authenticity and unfortunately systems and institutions are built
around that dynamic that tend to imagine that they have ownership of that process when they don't
this is a spiritual path that is outside of any time and space and certainly any institution
and what we need are people getting initiated into their own existence into their own reality
and what happens is we don't have healthy figures walking us along those rites of passage
that help us recognize our own cosmic inheritance in this in this plane of existence whatever it is
Rob do you hear do you hear Dr. Price talking directly to you this is Lucifer do you hear
Dr. Price talking directly to you yeah I hear the maxing on Apollo's temple which is know
thyself the first maxing yeah there's no thyself and I think that's that's that's
it's the first maxing for a reason what about your stain what about your stain rob what about
your stain do you have any particular stain that John is washing away in this process of rebirth
not yet no let me let me let me it's kind of unfair to expect John to gather all the information he
needs to assist me in what I just like go back to what you were saying about the whipping
and being naked yeah and going into that initiation and I'd certainly be glad it was John
I'd certainly be like oh I'm okay it's John I can trust John but are we talking about like
Laurel or are we talking about olive branches is that the kind of initiation because these kind of
things are what are reported from the ancient times aren't they I've been reading about them
over the past couple of days about incubations and the kind of processes you'd go through and
these are some of the processes and they have valid reasons for ethnogenic purposes
for some reason that they've come up with these processes of health and beneficial
means of going to an incubation and having a situation which you'd go to an incubation for
