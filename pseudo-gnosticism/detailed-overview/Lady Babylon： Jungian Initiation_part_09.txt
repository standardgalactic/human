I don't know John personally with what I'm saying and I don't know all of John's qualifications but
what I do know of John is everything that comes across as organic organic and something that needs
to be a part of other people's lives I've said it's it's probably it's probably the best cast
kept secret amongst podcasts and it's a damn shame that people don't watch more of it because it's
got so much content there that we were talking about the initiation from the past but is it
Sean Sean Manu Manso yeah Manso and that guy's in the future is absolutely fantastic with
thinking about an initiation and making your own set and setting it was absolutely fun it was a
joy it was a joy to watch and listen to how we've done it because it resonated it resonated so
well with you know I've even thought there is there is need for music therapy
you know you could you could have a client come to you with a certain set of problems
and you could prescribe six or seven songs to go go home and listen to them and see what happens
you know given the right circumstances that could work and Sean's doing that to an extreme
I just thought it was fantastic it was it was something that is daring and it was beyond the
boundaries that was and that could be incorporated incorporated into the psychedelic experience
for all the people who are really looking for the psychedelic experience they're not looking for
they're looking for therapy in a therapeutic setting that's what I get from the psychedelic
community out there that's what they want they want a therapeutic setting they can get some
assistance and experience a different perception it's a different perception essentially that
you're looking for and once you get that different perception then it's yours to use and hold and
mold into whatever you want and you're not providing that in a correct manner in the
correct setting there's paramount it's absolute paramount it's it's a worry I have worries about
this the salesman and the marketing and and the use of the use of it to make money
because it's the complete opposite I found the same with Buddhism I'm afraid I wasn't christened
as as a child I wasn't christened so I took to finding a religion when the internet bloomed
and I kind of said I liked Buddhism and I self settled for Buddhism I liked Taoism really really
really really good read really made sense and resonated but then I went into
finding more about Buddhism and found as there was a lot was like a payment for retreat
and from what I'd gathered from Buddhism it was the polar opposite to what Buddha would
prescribe to he wouldn't he wouldn't be asking for money let's see it's not about this monetary
policy we of course money makes the world go around but
you know it's it's not it's not so essential essential is yeah well yeah we play the telephone
game with the like supercharged content you know like it you know somebody has a direct experience
and then that gets watered down and played out and it becomes rigid forms of structure
that we can apply as opposed to speaking back to relationship and fractals and part of Rob let's
use us as an example part of the nature of why the relationship is so effective is because you
as the subject of the experience and me as the object of this kind of healing
you know you hope right you hope that's a projection by the way I mean I'm a person you know but
in the nature with authority and with presence and with experience and with the words and
you can come in and you can share yourself and what will happen over time is you will introject
the dynamic subject object gets introjected so eventually I hear the voice of my healers
in my consciousness and eventually I become the voice of healing for my consciousness I told you
it was trying to possess you Rob I warned you you didn't listen very good no that's it no that's
it you're you're absolutely one of the members now you're born again and you're you're fresh in
that stream you see how you see how it works and that's that's what we're predicting for the future
will bring down this entire satanic operation the fact that there is some real physics in this
process and that John is not just a sham you know trying to make himself some money on the side
he is there in the trauma you guys couldn't you guys couldn't have brought this together more
beautifully I let me tell you both I'm so profoundly thankful for your time today and I I will end
I will end the show here so thank you for those of you who joined today this is the kind of content
that I would like to bring forward for you and I appreciate you and I appreciate your comments
I'm not selling you anything I have nothing to offer you besides my dedication and the dedication
of my guests to the muse thank you for coming thanks Rob
