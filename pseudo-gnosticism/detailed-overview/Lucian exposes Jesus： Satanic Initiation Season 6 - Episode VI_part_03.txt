Um, I'll take that for what it is.
Um, and he was also into the cursing of your enemies into finding payola, you
know, stuff like that.
Um, these people are not trustworthy.
Are they almond?
No.
No, little Timmy.
These people are not trustworthy.
Right.
Um, these are the, these are the people that will take those children from their
family members.
You know, they'll jump on a boat.
These guys will boat jack you while you're out there.
You're when your parents leave, here comes the lace days.
All right.
It's a robber.
Okay.
Let's keep going.
I'm sorry, but it feels so good people.
It feels so good to be in those sources.
Oh, it feels so good.
Okay.
Um, what else is going on here?
Oh yeah.
And he, he knows how to, um, to work the lots.
Right.
That's important.
And he sees this dot, this, um, this magician guy who we're going to find out later
as a doctor, this magician guy, he knows, he knows, um, all of this has all this
knowledge and he sees that this young kid has everything it takes to drive.
He's not just beautiful.
Right.
But he has the drive to be able to succeed as a lace stays.
Yeah.
This kid is the promised lace stays.
This kid has the talent.
Yeah.
You should see who his clients are.
You want to know an antiquity?
Look at their clients.
You got any statues made about you?
I don't.
They made statues.
Yeah.
To Alexander.
Where are we talking by the way?
Geographically, we're talking in the south side of the bat black sea south side of the
land.
Little place called pathway.
Go Mia.
It's a wild frontier, but the people there have customs.
You don't want to step on any toes.
Let's see what Alexander can do up there as a lace stays.
Bring me that text back one more time.
I just want to read down the bottom chewy.
Thanks.
Yep.
Here we go.
And so what does he do?
What does this guy do?
He takes him in as a student and he trains him up to be at first like his underling and
then his personal assistant and ultimately his deacon.
Wait, what?
Yeah.
His deacon.
Wait, I thought that was Christian.
It is.
It's mystery terms.
Within the cult.
How do you think they're getting these kids?
They're drugging them.
Yeah.
Abducting and drugging.
Remember the kid Judas that got drugged?
We're about to see it again.
Remember Phillip.
There we go.
Oh, I don't know how much of that got cut out, but I'll just keep going.
Yeah.
So he says, look, he says, look, the guy was a doctor and this guy knew drugs and then
he quotes Homer, right?
Because he's, I don't know.
Lucian's just got to show everybody he's educated and literate.
And how did you show people you were educated in the ancient world?
You quoted Homer.
You mean you didn't quote the Bible?
No, that thing's not around till the third century.
No, you don't quote that.
You quote Homer.
You quote Homer.
That shows that you've learned.
You've learned your letters.
Fantastic.
What about those other languages?
What other languages?
Show me.
Bring me.
Besides a few fragments of BS.
Show me some literature.
They don't have it because the language is equipped to handle the burden.
That's the magic of the Greek.
That's the magic.
I'm going to show you a word.
You're not going to believe exists.
There's nothing we get like that in English.
You're not going to find it in Hebrew.
You're not going to find it in Ugaritic.
You're not going to find it in any other form of dialect or dialogue anywhere.
It's just the pinnacle.
The pinnacle of linguistic mastery.
Ancient Greece, man.
It's all women teaching it too.
