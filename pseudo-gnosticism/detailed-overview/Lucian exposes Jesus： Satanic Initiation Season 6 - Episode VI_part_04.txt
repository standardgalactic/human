Bronze Age.
Late Bronze Age.
Love it.
Why do you think they came up with oracles?
It's all women.
Love it.
Why don't you feminists go out and read your sources and stop giving ridiculous lectures of nothing?
Sorry.
Sorry.
I won't do that again.
Okay.
Let's go back to the...
Let's go to the next source.
Let's go to the next source.
Anyway, drugs, drugs, Homer was telling the quote in Homer was about drugs.
It was about drugs.
There are some drugs that are really good, strong drugs that are helpful in healing.
And there are other drugs.
You know what I mean?
It'll take you into a place of darkness.
It'll bring you into that zone.
Woo!
Right?
That's the kind of stuff that these Bronze Age people are telling.
And most famous of them are the women, Medea and Cersei.
Love it.
Okay.
Look at this quote here.
I just want to focus one more time that he's a child.
In our book, he's a child.
He's not through puberty yet, right?
He's right at the point of ripening.
Perfect ripening is how they looked at it.
And I mean perfect isn't farming perfect, you know?
Coming to the point of collection when one goes out and collects the fruit.
That's how it's being talked about, you see?
Okay.
When you start reading Jesus more closely, you're going to now recognize.
You're going to see the images that I'm giving you.
And you're going to recognize it in his little speeches now.
To his sheepies.
To his sheepies.
Yes.
What are you doing with that woman, Jesus?
Okay.
Go.
Bring us the next text, Chewie.
Up.
Look at this, people.
This is time for just the definition of may rocks.
This is a young girl, right?
Merakion was the other, the boy, right?
But I just want you to see a little look at how they define it, you know?
You know, last.
Okay.
What is the last?
How old is the last?
Kind of a young, you know?
Yeah.
Exactly the age that they're trying to describe that Lucian is giving us.
That age of growing into ripeness.
Contemplate that for one minute, please.
Contemplate that.
This is how they're aging people.
Uh-huh.
When did you get to ripeness?
When did you become the fruit to be picked?
That's how they're looking at it.
All right.
It's very farming, very agricultural.
These people are steeped in it.
John Scarborough told me once.
He said, never forget.
90% of these people are farmers.
Yeah.
Okay.
Fantastic.
Love it.
Love it.
Let's go to the next one.
What is this one?
This is a word break.
I just want you to conceptualize this for a minute.
Blow that up, Chewie.
Yep.
That one too.
Love it.
Look, look, people.
What is Musio?
What is Musio?
Uh-oh.
Look at row number number two.
Breathe hard, especially during copulation.
It comes from a Greek root that means to groan, to groan.
You can groan within the right.
You can enter that state of groaning.
That bringing out that state is produced through this moose,
through this breath, this breath during copulation.
Brings the moan.
Brings the moan.
Okay.
You mean they had a word for that?
They had a verb for doing that?
Yes, they did.
I defy you to find something so complex, so complex, and so detailed
in any other language, including Latin, including, very much including Latin.
The Romans know that.
They know that.
Even modern classicists know that, right?
They know the difference between the Hellenists and the Latinists, right?
And I put the medievalists with the Latinists.
We know that.
