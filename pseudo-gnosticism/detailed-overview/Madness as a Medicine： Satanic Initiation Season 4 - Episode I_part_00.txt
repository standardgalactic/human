Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burned to my veins
Indian goes crazy and the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've gotcha sellin' and you got your drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah, drinkin' whiskey, oh yeah
Tonight on the season premiere of Lady Babylon, Satanic Initiation
I have managed to secure for you an interview of an extraordinary, wonderful celebrity
I've brought it to you, I'm bringing it right to you tonight
We're going to be able to ask some hard hitting questions
Starting with round one tonight, we're going to move forward into that new discovery
That new Bronze Age discovery
And we're going to look at the specific drug, the compound, that's so important
It's going to lead us along the path of the mystery
Tonight, season four begins, Lady Babylon
Music
Tonight's subject of medicinal madness is brought to you by necessity in the present
We're going to look at these drugs, we're going to look at the combos that they're using
We're going to look at the people who are using them
We're going to ask why
And tonight we get to drop into a very sleepy place
A place where we can breach all of those bounds that we don't normally breach
We can bring forward in that religious ecstasy
We can bring forward that music
I think we have an example of some musical ecstasy
Can you hit it, Chewie?
Music
So, can we pull up the headline?
Yeah
This is just something to pull out of the present, right?
Something just to anchor us here
Yeah, woman has loud and full body orgasm during LA Philharmonic Concert
So, what is that old association?
Tonight, the reason that we have to come through this appearance of the orgasm
Or the orgasmos in Greek
Orge root, we're coming to the orgia
We're coming to the place where we bring out the bachic voice
Where we bring that out, right?
And in order to get there, we have to anchor ourselves with, you know, why?
Why are we doing this?
The drugs that were in that Bronze Age hair
That constellation of drugs are tangled within a right
That involves sexuality
It involves the individual coming to the point of what you and I would call the orgasm under the influence
And if that individual does not have within themselves that milk of calm
If they do not have that milk of calm, they won't be coming back
So, the knowledge here is fantastic
The capability of these Bronze Age priestesses pharmacologically is considerable
So tonight, I want to look at Mandrake
But before we do, I want to put everything within context
And the reason that we're here in Season 4 is we are hunting
We are hunting for the mystery
We are putting Jesus within the evidence
We're looking at the evidence of what we have
So that we can say, what was that naked kid doing with Jesus?
Now, I've been asking that question for several years
What was that naked kid doing with Jesus?
And I can tell you from the different types of responses that I've gotten from the academic community
By and large, overwhelmingly, it is fearful
People don't want to talk about it
So tonight, I thought we'd nail down Jesus and see what he thinks
Chewie, roll that
It's me, everybody's favorite Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ
And I just wanted to take a short break from my very busy schedule
You know, miracles, of course, have the really important Jesus duties up here
So that I could have a little divine intervention with you
Let's see, you've got a question for me here
Let's read it
I have just one very important question
What were you doing with that naked kid with whom you were arrested with at 4 a.m. in the public park?
Oh, yeah, you're referring to Mark 1451
I was sharing the gospel
Good word
I know what it looks like
Yeah, listen
Trust me, I was already canceled 2,000 years ago
I don't think I could be canceled again
It's alright
I love you
Stay blessed and try not to do anything I wouldn't do
Amen
Amen
I agree with 80% of you
He looks guilty, doesn't he? He looks really guilty
Credits
Credits to Jesus for answering
And for understanding
The cost of such things, of his ability to speak
Shouldn't be more than $40
Yeah, yeah
Thank you Jesus for your response
At least Jesus had the guts to stand there
And to look us in the eye and to give us an answer
The majority of people that you encounter that you ask them this question
What kind of answers will they give you? We're overheating here
What kind of answers will they give you?
Yeah, you'll be shocked at what you get
You'll see the person come right out
Come right out from that proposition
