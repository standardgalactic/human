Giant sledgehammer
Right, this is the death and resurrection of the mystery
For those of you who call yourselves Christians
This is the mystery that you took up
After your master Jesus
Who was himself arrested in a public park
At 4 a.m. with a naked boy
Tonight we welcome his old boy here
Where's his old boy here?
Nope, he's not here
Your four minutes later
We're going to have to revoke the pay that he does not get
As we wait for Old Boy
Just to give us a little background on the Britons
Our interest is with the Puella
Is with the Puella who brings the miraculous cure
And here he is, here's Old Boy
Let me introduce you to the group
Old Boy is an intensive Greek student
And he has an interest in finding out things Britain
And tonight I just want to ask him
As an ignoramus, as somebody who does not study this field
It is not my field
But I like to dabble in it because we all can read, right?
Tell me something, do we have any overlap
Between these classical Bronze Age queens
Performing their magic and doing their sexual thing
Do we have any overlap between these
And, you know, are there Britons anywhere
That we can pull up rock and find these same people
Tell me about it
I've definitely, first of all, can you hear me okay?
Okay, so basically I've come at this from a point of view
Where I actually was looking into this history and mythology
And I started noticing these sort of themes
And then when I stumbled across your work
I noticed that there was these similarities
And that was kind of spurred me on to look into it deeper for Shewer
So as I've gone into some of the texts
And I'm looking at it through this lens of trying to
Well, just seeing it from everything that you've been sort of teaching
And showing in these past videos
And there's definitely more tips that are cropping up that are similar
So basically today the presentation that I've got
We've looked at some of the Irish mythology
It's actually taken us to the Irish mythology and to Maeve
So that's what we're going to be looking at today
Fantastic, do you want to just throw her out there?
I know that, let me ask this, I know that Maeve is the same person
M-E-D-B is the same person perhaps as M-A-B
What is it with the overlap of these princesses?
Can we keep these people straight or are they all becoming one?
Well, the linguistics definitely think there's some connection
Between the old Irish and the old Welsh
So Maeve, which is sometimes spelled M-E-D-B
Her name is assumed to be cognate with the Celtic Meadu
Which means Mead from the proto-Indo-European Meadu
Which is Mead or Honey
This is continued into the old Irish, Mead, the old Welsh, Mead
Modern-day Welsh, Mead, which is spelled M-E-D-D
And Breton, Meads, so Breton is kind of like the Brittany area
So this was a colony that left from Cornwall and set up in Brittany
So of post-Roman era
So you also get the adjective Mead-O-Wa
Which is derived from the noun and underlies the old Irish Maeve
Which is strong or intoxicating
And in the Welsh you get Meadu, which means drunk
And so you can see that this, see the thing that I like about the Welsh
Is that you can see the component word
So for example, Mead means the Mead
You have Meadu, which is intoxicated
There's a herbal remedy called Meadaglin
Which that's got quite a history to it
It seems to be a bit of a watered-down version of it these days
But when you're reading the old text it does seem to be more of like a herbal kind of remedy
And then the doctor's actually a Meadig
So you can see how the component has connotations associated with healing
And also intoxication
And that's where the crossover seems to be
Because Maeve's daughter, Findavar
Some people actually link that name with Gwynhavir
Because in the Welsh it's pronounced Gwynhuvir
So it's slightly different in the Welsh
In the old Welsh and the old Irish
There's this kind of connection which some people say exists
It makes me think that the Pulascian
They think maybe the proto-Indo-European was Pulascian or something
It makes me think that this overlap between
The Mycenaean Digama in Medwa
Versus Medea
Versus your Britons and Celts
Welsh, Irish, using this very same route
It makes me think that somehow that's older
And it's coming through
Linguistically it's coming through different branches
I wonder, do you think...
What do you think of the magic angle of all of this?
Because don't all of these women have magical powers?
Yeah for sure
