Yeah, it's definitely there
Because if you look at Maeve herself
It looks like she had nine husbands
And you actually had to marry her to become the king
And the deal was sealed with an offer from a cup
From a chalice
And even in the texts, for example
She's not married to Cullen
But when he comes
She knows he's got this rage
So she does everything to placate him
They bring out thrice and fifty women
This is a number that crops up time and time again
Thrice and fifty
But she spends the night with him herself as well
Even though her husband's in the castle
So she's spending that time with him
And it says in the text as well
He gets the champions reward
Which is a drink from a chalice and wine
And she gives him a dragon stone as well
And it says the size of both of his eyes
And then I've been to a few of these old buildings
These old aristocratic houses just in England
And I have seen images of the man feeding from the breast as well
So, you know, there's people who are definitely trying to preserve this
Anyway, definitely
Yeah, and we didn't get there tonight
But in that...
Okay, so if we know that the sexuality is part
Part and parcel of the whole foundation of the rite
And the kings and the passing on of power
All that kind of stuff
It's all the way back to Georgia
Where we're talking about kingdoms
Yeah, definitely
Could it be?
I hate to keep pushing this because people don't
They don't want to talk about it
But could it be that they were doing...
They found something that they were doing something
Medically that was sexual and involved drugs
That's just because of our weird kind of perverted history
That we don't... we can't look at it for what it is
Is there any hope?
I'll ask, is there any hope for bringing back the sex rite
Without cracking the ceiling of the universe?
You know what I mean?
I think definitely there's a way to do it
I think it's down to understanding as well really
And I think you present that idea to somebody who hasn't got the context
And the background and probably you would seem quite abstract to them
But certainly when you're reading these mythologies and these texts
It just seems people didn't kind of bat an eyelid to that kind of thing
Co-Cullen's wife, she's letting him go off and do these types of things
So I think there's definitely scope
I think it's just getting a bit more of an understanding out there
To a wider audience
It's just a matter of time before we have fetal communion
Fetal communion that will enable us to fend off certain diseases
Enable us to live longer healthier lives
Maybe less inflammatory lives
Something anti-carcinogenic, you know
Something that gives us, you know, why did they hold up this serpent?
Why did they follow these traditions?
Why is this the thing that has been more influential?
We think that we're in a Judeo-Christian society
I hear people talk about that all the time
You can talk about monotheist society
You can talk about the West
But that still obscures the fact that our entire history is not about nations and peoples
It's about a right
And it's about the use of a right
The Jews, the Orthodox Jews and the Christians
The Fundamentalists, they know they have an instinct
Because it's baked into their own foundations
I love this
I love this
Let's bring Lady Babylon back
And oh boy, we'll do that
You and I will bring her back
How's that?
Let's make webs doing it, yeah
Alright, alright, thanks for coming tonight
Thanks to everybody for being here
And thanks to all boy who is our new star
Hail Satan
Hail Satan, thank you
Drinking whiskey
Oh yeah
