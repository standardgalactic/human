Lamia is a Libyan queen.
And Lamia in her intercourse with Zeus.
Sacrifices her children.
Yeah.
Yeah, she has to to the jealousy to the jealousy of Hera.
Yeah, those children are lost, taken away from her.
So imagine Lamia, who is the mother who pulls out her own eyes.

She prowls the world looking for young boys.
Yeah, looking for young boys.
You know me, Cersei.
Well, I showed you, Cersei.

Let's take a look at Lamia.
Shall we?
Let's go to Libya.
Let's get in our ship and go to Libya.

So what is he doing?
For those of you who are asking, why are we on this field trip?
Because here we're going to take a look away from the garden where Jesus is
arrested with that naked boy.
And we're going to look at the cross.
And we're going to say, okay, this is the all part of the same crime scene.
Right.
So what is he doing there?
What is he saying?
God, we can get us, you know, do all sorts of things.
But what do we have record wise?
We get records of his speech.
So what is he saying before he's dying?
And maybe we can solve the idea of why does he die prematurely?
Right.
People don't realize everybody in the world will tell you Jesus Christ was crucified.
He died by crucifixion.
He didn't die by crucifixion.
That's what the Roman guards noticed.
Centurion, that dude's already dead.
He's not supposed to be dead yet.
Nobody else is dead.
It's been, hasn't been enough time.
You know, they were engineers, right?
