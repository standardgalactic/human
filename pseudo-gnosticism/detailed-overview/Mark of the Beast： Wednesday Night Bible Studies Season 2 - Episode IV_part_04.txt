We've only seen this in one other group and that is the group from Georgia.
It turns out that's how you know a daughter of ETS is that her skin glows.
That's why we call her one of the reasons we call her the granddaughter of the son.
She glows.
Interesting.
Libyans.
Beautiful.
The glance of the eyes aroused affection and yearning in the souls of all that be held.
That's interesting.
Sort of.
She's got a Henry Cavill thing going.
Yes, Chewie.
Don't look like that.
You know what I'm talking about.
The rest of the body was hard and protected by scales and all the lower part was snake.
Ending in the snake's baleful head.
Now the story does not say that these animals were winged like the Sphinxes.
Nor that they like them spoke or made any sound whatever except a hissing noise.
That's the hissing of the pipe.
It's the same word to express it.
Right.
Talking to angels.
You don't hear.
You don't hear what you think what has been portrayed to you in a fairy tale.
Yeah.
It says in the text that you hear the sound of an instrument.
Everybody's like what?
His voice is like a trumpet.
What?
Yeah.
And they don't understand it because we've lost the context.
Scales.
And what did they do?
What do these lame I do?
These lame I go out and they hunt.
They hunt after young boys whose blood they suck.
Whose blood they suck and whose flesh they eat.
It is all in the blood and in the body.
What do these lame I look like?
What do they look like?
Please.
Let's go to set our timeship for Aristophanes, Athenian, comedian, young guy.
Well, you know, he's he's right.
He's pretty young when he's when he's successful, highly successful.
Right.
And here he is.
