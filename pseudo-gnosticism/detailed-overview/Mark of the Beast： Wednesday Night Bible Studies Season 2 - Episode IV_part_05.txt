What is he writing?
He's identifying.
This is from the frogs.
Aristophanes play where Dionysus get that off of there for a minute.
Let me explain context.
I'm terribly.
They shouldn't have done that.
It's the frogs and he's explaining Dionysus and Xanthias are going to the underworld.
They're making their trip.
They're catabasis.
If you if you want to.
But they're making their trips to the underworld and then coming back and they're going to bring back with them.
Euripides is not funny.
They're going to bring back with them Euripides, but they run into on the way chorus of initiates.
They look for Heracles.
Heracles.
Yes.
And remember, this is the same stage where we took in Greece, where we took that Bacchic religious procession and funneled it into the stage right there in the stage.
So that thing could be performed in front of you.
So when Aristophanes steps up there, he's not stepping up there as a war brothers guy.
Right.
He's not working for Disney.
He's working for the muse.
This is a sacred act.
This is a sacred act.
So everything must be.
John on.
If we're going to bring back Lamia so that Jesus can sit on the cross and scream.
Lamia sabak son.
The one from the one from the zone.
From the liminal earth.
The one to bring back from the dead, the great queen.
Yeah.
If we're going to invoke her like Jesus did on the cross, then we're going to have to understand who she is.
We have a very beautiful, just very brief little description in Aristophanes frogs.
Let's bring that up again.
Oh, isn't this nice?
Impusa toy nun esti.
We're defining who she is.
She is the Impusa.
That's the lame.
Yeah.
To re goon.
Lampe tie.
Hop on.
To stop.
