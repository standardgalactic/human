Sunday morning, dark clouds rising Oh there's no sunshine anywhere
Strong winds blowing, God give us wisdom To grasp the message in the air
Oh if I could have one wish And know that it would come true
Had a wish that God would give us strength To know just what to do
Then we could tear down the fences That fence is no longer
Fences created by such evil men Then we could tear down the fences
That fence is no longer Maybe we could walk together again
You're going to have to set aside your ethical, moral, cultural, personal difficulties
You're going to have to set all those aside I'm going to show you some texts
I'm going to take you a place that you haven't been and you may want to come back
You may get there and say the student is too much, it's too much
This is too much ancient great cult This is too much, just can't take it
No I know, I know that's not true, you're going to love it
Tonight on Lady Babylon
Good before we play our clip tonight to kind of purify the space, you know what I mean
We're going to be looking at just a couple of comments
It's nice they're going back and forth answering each other
You guys are geniuses, I know that and I appreciate your time
I see your comments and I really appreciate your time
Let's chew it, let's pull up that first one
Let's give our shout out to the people who are making the experience worthwhile
I've heard you speak, this is from Renee
Renee I've heard you speak highly of Medea but in the Argonauts she murdered her children
Is there a different version of her story?
And then strangely enough the next comment gave a great response to that
Thank you user, so and so
He answers this in one of the episodes and no she didn't actually kill her kids
Apparently there's a source, yeah take it down, thanks
Thank you for doing that, that's like you got my back, I appreciate that
There is indeed, there are several sources and one of them is Elian
If you want the controversy, you see it was Euripides
Who was being bribed by the Corinthians because this was Corinthian propaganda
We have a description of her, the monument that they set up
Once it was declared, right so let me step back
Elian, look at Elian for one of the sources that you'll be able to find this
But look what's going on, you're in Corinth and they've got a plague
And they're like what's the deal, send the embassy out to the Pythia, right?
Right always to the Pythia, this is the same priestess
Right this is the same group of oracles that dictate what goes on in the world
You and I wouldn't be sitting here knowing the name Socrates without them
Talk about empire, gorgeous the oracles, what do the oracles tell the Corinthians?
Hey you got a plague Bozos because you falsely claim that Medea killed her own children
When you know there was a mob of people
When she burned the palace down who cornered her kids
They cornered her kids, they beat them to death and then threw them into a well
And then to add impiety to their crime
They blamed Medea for having killed her own children
A smear of her personality, a smear it was
And the ancient source that we have is talking about
We all know the monument they're talking about because once the embassy got back with that
With that message they built a monument there at the site where they threw the bodies of her children
Said hey, mea culpa, mea culpa, right?
Many of you talk about Medea, we're not talking about myth
We're talking about Ligea, so I'm going to bring in Edgar Allen Poe
I'm going to bring in Edgar Allen Poe tonight, I don't want you to get into the place that you need to be in
Unless you come through those vapors of Edgar Allen Poe
I'm going to show you some dark stuff tonight, okay?
This is the good stuff, this is what you, you know, you got access to it tonight
Chewy, let's hit that video, cleanse the temple
Music

What did Ed Poe know that we don't?
The name Ligea is an epithet of the muse
It means that clear or shrill voice, that piercing voice
Penetrates everything, that is Ligea
And if you really want to know
If you really have ears to hear
You will be able to read Ed Poe for the first time
Love it, love it, absolutely love it
Thank you Ed, thank you Ed
Say hello, say hello to Chuck
Fantastic, let's bring up these dirty, dirty texts
Okay, now what I'm bringing you tonight, we're going to start by summoning the prophet Ambakum
Come here Ambakum, you're one of my favorites
Here we go, we're going back to the Septuagint
And I want us, he's going to pop in here and he's going to tell you
Like it's a prophetic warning to those who have ears to hear
Hit it, Chewy, let's go right to Ambakum
Look at this, verse 15
Oh petit zone, oh you who are making your neighbor drunk
With that maddening outpouring of wine
Yes, yes, that maddening, bonkic outpour
Why are you doing it? Why are you cursed?
Ambakum, tell us, tell us Ambakum
You're doing it in order to uncover their what?
Spellaya, their grotto
The place where the lace tastes, does his business
Yes, yes, you shouldn't be doing it boys and girls
You shouldn't be going to the grotto
You shouldn't, it's bad news for you
Remember what that place is, show us the grotto
And the Greek here, yes, yes, no, no, one off
Yes, there we go, look at this people
Just take a look, quick, quick, at number two
Number two, look at the number two
