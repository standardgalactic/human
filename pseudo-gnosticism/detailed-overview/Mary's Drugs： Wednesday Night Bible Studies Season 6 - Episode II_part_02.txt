But look at number two
Look at number two
Your seminarians can be excused now
Because they don't have access to this
Your seminarians don't know this
Right, your Bible scholars
You people don't have access to this stuff
I'm giving it to you
Look at number two, to wipe clean
Especially in magic ceremonies
Especially in magic ceremonies
Look at the very last line of that
Of a serpent of that paragraph
Of a serpent, right?
To apo maso ton ion
We've all learned what that ios is
We know it's the poison, take it down
What is she, wait a minute
What's going on here?
What between Jesus and Mary?
What is going on?
I want to see it
I'm going to have to tune us in here
I'm going to have to turn up the resolution
I want to see it baby
I want to feel that stone, cold marble
The stone cold, what?
Yes, how do you think we get there?
Fantastic, next one
Let's go to the next one
I just want you to see that this is her beautiful hair
And I want you to notice
This way of describing a priestess is typical
Not only a priestess, but a goddess
A goddess, and look you can see
It's in the Orphic hymns
But who is the goddess that it talks about?
In the Orphic hymns
She is Bacchus
Because everybody knows
The savior has that beautiful hair
Right, she's the one who bears the goddess
Interestingly enough, interestingly enough
She's there for what?
I'm going to show you, it says in the Greek
What Jesus is doing to her
Who brings that power
She who is that
Bringer of the goddess
Let's see what she does to Jesus
And let's see what Jesus does to her
I want details, details
Fantastic, give me the next one
Yep
Oh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, just, that's okay
Let's keep going to the next text
Boom, here we go, here we go
More, more, more of knownness
Right, what does she do?
Yeah, working from the top
She does what?
She moistened that hair of hers
Haite diabrochon
What is her, what is her hair?
It's slick, it's got that stuff in it
This is, she has come already
For this whole event
This is gorgeous, what you're about to see
I'm about to show you things
You didn't know Mary did
Okay, you will know
You will know
And what is she, again
She's the beautiful haired producer
Of the goddess, chalice of the goddess
For the Christ
Yes, for the Christ
And what does she put?
I want you to look at that first line
Iqmadi, Iqmadi
What did she put in her hair?
I didn't see that, I didn't see that
What is it? Iqmas
Iqmas is a body fluid
She put Jesus' body fluid
How are their body fluids involved at this point
With all of this drug terminology
Starting to get to me
Let's keep reading, she's going to do something
For those of you who are not adults in history
Those of you who aren't intellectual adults
You're going to want to leave the room
You're going to want to leave the room
Because we're going to look at a text
We're going to look at a text from antiquity
That is going to explain it
This is gorgeous, I love it
Okay, let's put that one up again
Yeah, oh, and okay
