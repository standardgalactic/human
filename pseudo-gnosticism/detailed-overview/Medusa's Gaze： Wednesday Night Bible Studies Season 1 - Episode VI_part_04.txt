So thank you, thank you.
Let's go to the next verse and see if we can take our words
and put them into this clay, into this breathing.
This thing that's happening.
Yeah, so on the next line, gorgofone.
She is the gorgofone.
Oh, it got cut off at the top a little bit.
Maybe it's a...
Yeah, there we go.
Gorgofone, right?
What is she?
She's the killer of the gorgon.
She's the killer of the gorgon.
Who is that gorgon?
That gorgon is her own priestess, right?
That gorgon is her own priestess.
It is from the footprint of that priestess's offspring
that comes from her severed head.
It is from that offspring that the hippocrine,
the fountain of the muses, flows.
Okay?
Remember, Pythagoras said,
you want us found a city, an antiquity?
He's not talking myth.
He's talking to people who are out going to take their supplies,
get into a ship, go across the Mediterranean to North Africa,
and start a Greek colony.
And they're like, what should we do?
And he's like, number one,
the first thing you do before anything else,
build a temple to the muses.
Build a temple to the muses.
And your civilization will begin, right?
You'll have justice that way.
Okay, so here she is, the one who brings that fountain.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
She's the one who fugolectre.
She's the one who does not go to the bed of reproduction.
She does not.
Why?
She's the Virgo, right?
She is not ready.
She is perpetually.
You didn't realize that the only we got in daughter of God
was the perpetual virgin, did you?
No, she is, right?
Perpetual virgin.
She shuns that bed.
Shuns that bed, right?
Right?
She's the polu olbetechnon meiter.
She is the mother of all skill.
Technae, technae.
If you want to, if you want to stitch fabrics
in order to make a textile that displays a story on it,
you have to work with her.
She is the source of that.
Isn't that great?
I'm beginning to, I'm beginning to see all the angles
of this individual and it's gorgeous.
Yes, on the next line, I talked about hormones.
I talked about hormones before.
Here's the Greek.
Here's the Greek.
Hormastera.
Hormastera.
Hormastera.
Sotera.
Save your.
Hormastera.
She who brings the impulse.
She who brings the hormone.
She who brings the push.
You can't take your child and give her dedicate.
They call it dedication.
Give her to the temple of Athena.
Unless you expect that they will bring out in her
that invincible, medic or medusic virgin.
Medusa just means to rule.
It just means to rule.
When you create that six foot one hybrid,
12 year old hybrid, you have created a ruler.
A ruler with a greater capacity than you have.
Up here.
Greater capacity up here than you have.
Frene.
Good.
Good.
Let's see what happens.
I bet it does something to the brain.
And I bet those priestesses end up.
It's why they're always deciding what colony is going to go where
and what the judgment is.
And they bring in this murder and they're like,
what do we do with this guy?
He killed someone and she tells you,
why are they doing this?
Why does Western justice spring up in her courtroom?
The Greeks made a huge deal out of this
through Escalas with the Orestaia.
In the last play of the Orestaia, it's called the Humanities.
They transform the furies into the Humanities.
And how do they do it through Athena, the Virgin?
