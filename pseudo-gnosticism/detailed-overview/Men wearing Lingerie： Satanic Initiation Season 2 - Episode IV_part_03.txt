And sending me messages that say, oops, you said this
I didn't think this was right
And there it is
This is a problem that I've had in the past
With a lot of people
People always say, no, no, they can't be
When I tell you that Jesus Christ is arrested
In public park or forehand with an achid boy
You're like, oh, no, that cannot be
And then you look it up
And then you say it can be
And it is
And that's my reality
All right
So, what I would like to do
What I would like to do is to give you access
To that initiation pathway
And in order to do it
We have to revive that classical gymnasium
And we are going to do that in two weeks
Following the Heraclean understanding
Of the Bacchic woman's kit
The Minatic kit
This is the dress
Of the right
And if you are Heracles
You are wearing very nice lingerie
Very nice
This is a Queen's lingerie
All right
So in order
You know, I could just tell you
It's because one of the misogynists
Snuck on here
Started saying stuff
The pig has to be sacrificed
Right?
This beast that wandered in
Has to be sacrificed
And now we all have to wear
The kit of the Minet
I will be there as referee
It will be three rounds
Best two out of three
The first of two falls is out
Person by person
Mano imano
This is wrestling, right?
It's a gymnasium
And I will present questions to them
That will allow them to master
Or submit their opponent
All while dressed in Minatic kit
And people that I'm talking to
Are, you know, we have a good group now
But I would like a few more members
To join
It'll be going to the games night
We'll extend the time
And I think you'll see
Why this whole gymnasium thing
Is so necessary
You're getting tired of one voice
You need to see the laboratory
And you need to see how it's integrated
And how we turn these things
In the body movements
We need to get the muscle memory
Of it
And how are we going to do that?
We're going to follow Jesus
Right?
Where's my dolly?
I want to know where he touched me
Right?
We're going to follow Jesus
Because Jesus, now I'm speaking
To those of you who are evangelicals
Presbyterians, Catholics
Charismatics
Who's popular now?
Mega church people
Sitting in the giant stadium
Joel Osteen type
I'm talking to everybody out there
Who fits that description
You know
And I'm telling you
That not only was your God
Arrested in a public park with a naked boy
But the institution that built itself
Around that pedophile
Is an institution of pedophilia
Yes
Yeah
I published a book
On it in the early church
And you know
Several professors told me
That's what's going to get you fired
But what would you have me to do?
