What would you have me to do?
You people have entrusted me
With your time
I don't need to sit here
And give you garbage
I want you to have access
To that clear stream
And in order to do it
We're going to have to watch men wrestle
Dressed in classy
YouTube-friendly lingerie
And when you can do that
When you can do that
You can enter the state
Ask yourself
Why are bonkins always?
And so as you know
I was writing to Neil
To tell him about this
You've got to
Get out of the platinum wig
Don't bring that dirty blonde stuff
Don't bring the dirty blonde
You need platinum wigs
That hair should be wool
It should be the color of wool
Because we're going to Jesus
And Jesus in the apocalypse
Where we find Lady Babylon
Jesus is wearing
A lingerie top
With a wig of wool
Yeah, just beautiful
Beautiful platinum hair
Why is he doing that?
Because he's the morning star
And that's what she does
Yeah, okay
If you understand initiation
Now you know why
John has taken his boys
To the wilderness
I wanted to read
To resurrect to you tonight
Tomorrow morning
It'll be good to see everyone
Assemble
It'll be nice to meet you
To see you face to face
And we'll get to work
Right away
I want to finish tonight
Because what
I feel like I haven't given you
What you've come here for
Because we've just talked about me
So I want to bring up
To balance me
I want to bring up just for a minute
Charles Baudelaire
And his
Band poetry
Can I read you just
Four lines of his band poetry
This is from the Fleur de Maul
The Flowers of Evil
Are you ready?
This might be painful
Within the dwindling glow of light
From languid lamp
Sunk in the softest cushions
Soaked with heady scent
Hippolyta lay dreaming
Of the thrilling touch
That spread apart the veil
Of her young innocence
You're dirty
This is dirty
Is it just me here?
Have we entered the
This is Charles Baudelaire
And as you are reading
Charles Baudelaire
The Fleur de Maul
Which you will
As you come across
The Saturnian verses
Don't be surprised
That what I am saying is
Just what another dragon
Said before me
These dragons who stand
In the field of Mars
Did you ever wonder why
Madea's face, why her song
Stands in the field of Mars
You know
It's because we're at war
We're at war
And that's why you guys
Are going to show up
