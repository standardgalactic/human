She feels she knows this maid
This barren girl
By our desire fit to move the world
The gift of body's beauty is sublime
And draws forgiveness out of every crime
She knows no hell or any afterlife
And when her time shall come to face the night
With a capital N
Show me death like a newborn
Face to face in innocence
With neither guilt nor hate
Those of you with ears to hear
Will see her
And will know her
Where is that Englishman?
Rob, is Rob here?
Rob is not here yet
He'll be here in a minute perhaps
And perhaps I'll just in the show
He's probably doing something he shouldn't
Nasty man
We're here at the Field of Mars
We're here at the Field of Mars
Here he comes, but before we jump
We're here at the Field of Mars
And for those of you who don't feel
You have any obligation to defend
The great mother
To stand between the great mother
And the pollution of this existence
Right now in Ukraine
You and I are witnessing
Mothers and children being wiped out
Being wiped out
We're witnessing nations
Stand back and watch it happen
We're watching people justify it
There is something that rocks
Even the heart of the most stained fascist
And that's the mother
We take on the kit of the mean ads
Because we honor the great mother
Yeah, we make this space sacred for her
Rob, how are you doing, sir?
Oh
Yeah, hi, how are you?
You're all right, I was excellent
You know, I like hearing about your history
Excellent story on Israel
Is that Tel Megiddo?
Yes, that's Tel Megiddo
Yeah, and it was an excellent excavation
And everybody knows that on two of the nights
That I was there, people sat up out of bed
And said very strange things
And a very strange voice to me
It was a powerful experience
In a powerful place
And I will never forget
Riding horses through the valley of Jezreel
That's the way to go
Rob, what do you think about Heracles?
And his fascination with the kit of the mean ads
Profound? I always say profound
But it is profound, isn't it?
It's kind of a...
It's confusing to me
I'm going to be totally honest
It's confusing to me
To kind of emulate that
I mean, I'm not misogynistic
By any degree
But, you know, I just...
I don't want to come across as an opposition
In this, but I'm scared of it
I'm going to be honest about that
I'm scared of dressing up in lingerie
To be honest with you
And I don't feel like...
I support it completely
I'll support any expression
Would it help you, Rob?
Would it help you if I told you
That right now, behind these wars
Are people who are killing other people?
For doing things like dressing up
If you're a man like a woman
For questioning gender
For looking at masculinity
And femininity through a lens
That's not traditionally accepted
That the people...
You can just say Georgia, right?
Look at Georgia and what's been done
For the great mother
Could you consider it
For the sake of the great mother?
Consider it, I have
It's not something I haven't considered
Certainly I don't agree with
What people do in them countries
