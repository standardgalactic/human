I don't agree with that
It's really daft, in my opinion
And I don't have much time for it personally
I often hear of these things
Because I work in a place that
A few guys who come from the European community
Come over and we require them
Because of the skills that they have
And they have these views
They do have these views
And it's not very nice
I don't...
You know, in England
You can express your views without having to
Suffer serious consequences for them
But it's also as an effect
On the way people think of you
And it's not a very nice way
Of going about handling oneself
In a situation that's...
It can be...
As you say, it's devastating
To think people are losing their lives
For such a situation
Where they're only expressing it
You should be free to express yourself
However you feel like you want to
That's my opinion of matters
Like that
I want people to be able to express themselves freely
Without any reprise or recourse
In any way, shape or form, really
You should still be able to do that
Express yourself
How you are
And be honest with you
And show it, be proud of it
Because that is you
What if we get a little more active about it, Rob?
And what if we say it's almost an obligation
Of a free society
To protect its mothering source
To go out and to prevent
The destruction of that image
The image of the mother
And is that what is...
Heracles bears the name of his mother
Right?
Heracles
Yeah
Which she doesn't want
She doesn't want
And there's a whole mythology
And cult ritual built around this
There's entire temples around these great labors
One of which is getting a girdle
And in the end, Heracles ends up full grown land breastfeeding
From the mother of the cosmos
Isn't that nice?
The queen of queens
If we're going to bring that queen of queen back into our trinity
Cognitively
Because this is all quantum physics that we're doing
Don't we need to commit
To that state of mind
Where you and I can sit comfortably
I need to sit
And I want people to know
I want people to know
I was reffing from the start
In my normal attire
And it was Rob who said
Wait a minute
Wait a minute
We're going to all be dressed
In Victoria's Secret
But you're not
Right?
So Rob, I appreciate that
And after consultation with the devil
In fact, you have me
You have me on a
It's a clause within the contract
But it's something I have to abide by
So I'll be there too
I'll be there too
And we want people
We want to use this exercise
To show people that
The menatic starting point
Is still living
That the mystery they said
Was something that you could bring
That was living
That was a process
And this could affect history
That's why I keep saying
Let's bring back Lady Babylon
She is that operation
She is that all-bridging tower
And to bring her back
