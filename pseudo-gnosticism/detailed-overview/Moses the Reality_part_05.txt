It's a little bit, you know, there's a reason they sent Jesus to Egypt to get educated.
Right?
With all that money.
There's a reason he did.
Right?
It's just because things were not good.
Stories were not, were not up and running.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a shame.
But everybody knew that about the province.
Right?
Okay.
So it's just the way it is.
It's a fragment of history.
Down there in Alexandria, they were kicking everybody's butt.
Don't get me wrong.
Alexandria.
Woo.
That's where it was all happening.
That stuff just sucked in the world.
Right?
How can you come stand next to that?
You cannot.
Give me the next one.
Give me the next one.
Oh, yeah.
There we go.
Um, so here he said this thing that I just told you, I am being, I am being.
This is my own.
I only own.
This is my what name.
This is my Ionic name.
Now, um, how did the Hebrew handle this?
How did the Hebrew handle this and take every, everything off track after it with it?
All the English translations are going to follow this.
Right?
Um, look at forever at the end.
Yeah.
They'll lob.
Right.
Last time I saw, that's what it meant.
Yeah.
Right.
Fantastic.
Is that what, is that what Ionian means?
No.
No.
And they have those words.
They have several for something that goes on without end.
Yeah.
And it usually has a form of a on it because there's a lot of different dialects and developing.
So you get a lot of, you know, sometimes some repeat.
So, yeah, um, this is not it though.
Ionian, what is Ionian?
Look, you and I are going to go to the synagogue from the second century.
And I want you to look at it.
Okay.
We, you and I are in a second century synagogue.
And do you know who is on the walls?
Ion.
Because we know what Ionic life is.
Ion stands there and around him is this ribbon.
And that ribbon has 12 distinct separations on it.
Each of those separations is a house.
You mean, wait, an astrological stuff.
You mean the first Jews were astrologers?
Yes.
It's a huge part of why you have a sunna goge.
Why you have a synagogue.
That's a Greek word.
It's a Greek word.
Yes.
So, um, they're doing astrology.
Isn't that fantastic astrology and the Romans, by the way, Romans get a little bit upset about that.
And they have several decrees.
And it's kind of weird to read them.
The first time I read when I was like, what?
It's a decree to exile all the astrologers and Jews.
It's almost like they're an astrological sect, not an ethnicity.
That's how the Romans are treating it.
Yeah, Romans have something against those astrologers.
You know why?
It was rubbing up.
It always does.
It rubs up against rulership.
Right.
Yeah.
Because you can take somebody's birth and blow it up and determine everything.
Yeah.
You know what happens?
That stuff always happens.
The next thing you know, some kind of insurrection.
You can't tolerate that.
You have to kick out those astrologers.
Yeah.
That's the Roman, the Roman way.
Okay.
Thank you, Rome.
I kind of get it.
I kind of understand where you're going because you're looking at it from a civic kind of standpoint.
I understand.
But I never really got why you associated those two until I realized that the texts are all,
you'll see throughout any time that we study the Septuagint.
You're going to be shocked at how much of the astrology tech there is there.
How much of it stays.
So don't be surprised.
They're worshiping Ion on the wall.
Right.
On the wall.
Second century.
