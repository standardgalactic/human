Because they knew what holding up the serpent meant.
By the way, is Jesus itching his belly around here somewhere?

Go.
Don't you remember that?
Keep going.
There we go.
Yep.
Let's try that one.
Here are some variations.
No, that's always variations of it.
We're past that.
What else does God want us to do?
By the way, we're still in the fog.
Does anybody feel it?
I feel a little bit of the effects.

Right?
Plunder them.

Remember, this is the third century.
Right?
So where do you think?
Where do you think they're getting their images from?

Right?
Yeah.
And here he is.
Jesus.
Tell us what are we going to do?
We're going to elevate or introduce the use of those serpents.
And if you drink a phonosemone, a death inducer, it's not going
to hurt you.
And you will heal other people.
Right?
