necromancers how do we bring the logos we bring the logos via the lot yeah if you
were paying attention you would have seen the stars yourself and you would
have been able to go to where he was and give him what he needed yes you find
those you find those children right you find those children within the right the
mystery I've got news okay no this is gonna upset people by the way I'm still
reading all as many comments as I possibly can yeah and yeah there's a lot of
stuff good stuff in there but we have to go to a place it's not it's kind of
sensitive and kind of you know when the Dalai Lama was kissing that was kissing
that boy I was thinking to myself look okay this is the closest you're gonna
get to Jesus with the naked kid this is the closest you're gonna get this is
kind of a Jesus I mean come on right is there so much difference right you know
and nobody should be offended by that right nobody should be offended I hope
the Christians are offended to compare Jesus to Buddha I hope that's not bad okay
we could throw we could throw I think quite quite throw Moses and all the
Moses was cranking with the with the Venoms and this is the new area by the
way people right this is the new area watch what those Venoms do bring back
those serpents around the pole and watch what happens right watch what happens
to the medicine yeah oh this is gorgeous I love it I love this very much so it's
how is he doing that it's with that it's with that lot that he is able to cast and
catch in time just boom in order to pull down that power from the star right he
uses the lot that's how they always know the future and you thank you so
oh wait a minute there is that funny connection right between you know
divination and casting the lots yes there is and it's a principle of
randomization that's nice all that stuff is nice well what's important for us is
that in the text we not only see a very unique creation of lightning but but we
see it in a way that shines light on the apocalypse so that soon we'll be able
to chart the stars and say we are here welcome to the apocalypse thanks for
coming tonight
