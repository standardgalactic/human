Think of a fetus, grab this image
Think of a fetus growing in a rich chemical bath
This design to burn off his mortality
Yeah, there's a place in your skull
It's right in the middle of your head, it's called the third ventricle
I will meet you there, I will meet you in the third ventricle
There is a spraying there in the middle of your head
It's called water of life
We can access this water, we can access it
Think of that fetus developing
You take it back into yourself when you perform the sacrifice
When that mother comes to you and gives you that miraculous voice of her daughter
And she is dedicated to the temple, she is on the drugs that will be making her abort
And we will be consuming that abortion
People said, it's not about drugs
You can't say that bro, how long have I been telling everybody here
Give me my moment, I don't usually stand back like this, but give me my moment
I've been telling you people
The people in the Bronze Age were using drugs and not just mild ones either
Not just ones that give you constipation
I'm talking drugs that are mind altering
Big ones, how long have I been saying, people in the Bronze Age were huge drug users
What happened today, they wrote up, New York Times wrote it up and it turns out they've got the hair
And the hair shows that they were on some heavy psychotropic drugs
It's not like they just had them, if they're detecting them in the hair, that's from long term use
That's a chronic baby, these were chronics
Yeah, chronics, those Scythians, I tell you, you gotta love them
It was dyed red, it was dyed red, did you see that?
With everything that you people have been studying and you know what I'm talking about
Things I can't say that I know, right?
People have been studying this, their hair was dyed, it was dark red, it was dark red
Isn't that nice? Isn't that nice? Fantastic
Yeah, you know what I'm talking about, you're there, this is gorgeous
I'm gonna read a little bit to you, I'm gonna read a little bit to you
Yeah, would you like to? Yeah, let's go, I'm getting instructions here, chewy
We gotta jump, we gotta jump now
Grant my drugs the power of arousal which got us
And with my concoctions preserve the germinal semen of life
Established in the flames of desire
Thank you Seneca, thank you Seneca
That should get us in the right place
There's a good reason ancient witches became experts in the use of sexual drugs
They understood that the manipulation of sexuality was a means of transport
From the mundane to the magical
Ancient philosophers studied logic, mathematics and natural science
In pursuit of personal enlightenment, clerics read signs of the sky and prognosticated
On their irracular significance in order to avert disaster
And to honor the gods
Statesmen pursued oratorian law in order to perpetuate the machinery of ancient governance
And as equally valued members of ancient society
Greco-Roman witches studied the ecstasy of sexuality
In order to resurrect a bi-gendered creator
A gynomorphic god who was the key to unlocking a multi-dimensional universe
Witches
For a young priestess who served gods such as Hecate, Priapus and Dionysus
The secrets of the natural world were not just for the theoretical musings of natural scientists
