Let me give you water of life
Right out of your head
Right out of your head
Oh, God, it's delicious
You haven't drunk water until you've drunk from the waters of life
Are you thirsty? Are you thirsty?
You're gonna need an antidote
You're gonna need an antidote
That's why Nanna says, would they give them on a cross?
Anidote
Anidote
It's in the commentary on John
Love it
Love it
In the epodes by the celebrated Roman poet Horace
Canidia is presented as a cunning witch
Involved in the preparation of an infernal sacrifice
That is a ritual sacrifice to the gods of the underworld
As a witch or sorceress, Canidia uses snake venom, specifically vipered venom
To prepare sacrifices for slaughter
Vipers produce a venom that affects the ability of blood to coagulate
As predators, these snakes use hemorrhagic venoms to kill prey
But the complex protein toxins they employ may also help prepare their food sources for digestion
Venom glands and reptiles just evolutionarily develop saliva glands after all
And the poisons they synthesize are physiological active
When injected directly into the bloodstream
They recognize this, you can't eat these things
That's why you have to have the anal applicator
Did you ever wonder why that priestess walks around with a dildo?
Yeah
That's her wand
That's her wand
Sometimes they tie you down
I don't know, it gets questionable there, right?
Several popular mystery religions of Greece and Rome relied heavily on the use of vipers during their celebrations
And the iconography of this particular reptile regularly intrudes into the literature
With artistic representations of these same cults
Within the practices of these cults, vipers typically appear in the context of oracular transformation
That is, the vipers are represented as agents of maniacal metamorphosis
They enable mystery initiates to assume the madness characteristic of gynomorphic gods like Dionysus
Other snake species also creep into mythological references in very specific ways
That reflect the ancient world's fascination with gender switching and sexual manipulation
Remember these witches, right?
And they're developing these dotes and antidotes
And they're focusing upon sexual reproduction
Within the big tent of midwifery or gynecology
Think of that
Those of you who are evangelicals, hold your ears
Those of you who are in Tennessee, Texas, shout out to you guys
Open up your ears for a minute and listen
Listen to the fetus being bathed in the venom
Yeah, yeah
Genetic medicine, right?
For the biochemists out there who know what those toxins are capable of
And how they interact with human hormones
Yeah
