We've got glorious stuff there, glorious potential
There's a potential for a whole new form of medicine
Yeah, I'm gonna have a guest on Lady Babylon tonight
To talk about such things
Some genetic medicine, maybe
He'll take us to that spring that I was telling you about in the middle of your brain
Oh, God, it's the water of life, baby
Stars, priestesses and sorceresses
There's no extra time tonight, so just hang on there
If you don't mind, priestesses and sorceresses who pioneered the use of snakebillings for the regulation of menstruation
Believed in a universe composed of various overlapping planes
The ancient witches cosmos is strikingly similar to the multiverse of modern cosmologists who study astrophysics
Scientists like Medea, Cersei and Canidia believe that the universe was divided into three realms
These dimension-like realms were given the names Earth, Olympus, and Arabus
According to Greek accounts of the origins of the universe, the three realms of existence all possess basic elements and unique inhabitants
Earth was believed to be the realm of air, the element consumed by mortals
Olympus was a plane inhabited by gods who breathe ether
And Arabus was a realm of demonic powers
These powers breathe and ingest dark matter
Yes, that's what they called it
That's not the name that I just made up
They called it dark matter
The Greco-Roman realms of existence are very much like overlapping dimensions of reality
The inhabitants of each realm are invisible to the other realms, but can communicate and interact under specific controlled circumstances
Witches were most interested in the interactions of Arabus, the underworld, with the world of earthly mortals
That's what they specialized in, the connection of those two realms
Ancient mythographers recorded traditions that the gods of Arabus could only visit Earth by accessing portals or gateways through collapsed stars
This dark star is picked up across time by lots of not-so-friendly groups
And the process of working through a darkened star is central to the work of the sorceress
You have to capture that wave of space-time distortion that those collapsed stars produce
It's too much physics, poindexter
I know, I have a hard time too, those witches were smart
You gotta be a mental gymnast just to keep up with them, it's amazing
Due to the fact that these immortal beings and infernal demons breached darkness or dark matter
It was necessary to remove or destroy light sources in order to sustain their travel
Poets like Claudion of the late 4th century taught that the dark matter of Arabus neither reflected nor absorbed light
And thus was incompatible with the earth realm where light is abundant
When the gods of Arabus visited Earth, they were forced to remain within dark matter bubbles
It's cool what he mentions, yeah, it's a bubble of dark matter in order to sustain themselves for the transit
So dark matter bubbles
This is what we get in the rites of Apollo that use this, these oracular practices
Underworld gateways, the power to draw down the stars in order to open gateways to the underworld became the purview of witches
By employing poisons that contain the power to manipulate the basic elements of the cosmos
These witches believed they were able to enable the gods of the underworld to access the earth realm
The element manipulating powers of their drugs manifested themselves by alterations in sexuality
Okay, quantum
Witch witches viewed as alterations of the generative power of their bi-gender goddess
They're drawing the generative power of their goddess
You see how this goes back to the, you know, why Paul the Apostle is walking around saying, you worship nature
Of course they do, you idiot
Yeah, Paul was it, not the smartest knife in the drawer, you know
The power to draw down the stars in order to open gateways to the underworld became the purview of the witches
The element manipulating powers of their drugs manifested themselves by alterations in sexuality
Their drugs could sexually inflame their victims or stifle their arousal with the force of cold chill as in Seneca's Medea
After she, Medea, called out every sort of poisonous snake
She gathered together her accursed herbs
