Drugs used by witches to treat gynecological problems
Had become an important aspect of ancient medicine
Killing off individual witches did not put an end
To their broad influence and practices
Sexuality and magic were intimately tied together
Through the use of pharmaceuticals by doctors and midwives
Christianity tried in vain to wipe out the influence
Of these ancient witches
Yeah, fantastic
We're in the same place today
And that's why this can be very practical
This experience, this satanic initiation
Can be very practical
Because we are in a spot
We are in a spot where you may now see
They took down the Romans
Everything, the offspring of Venus
Could bring to the world all the beauty
What happened this week?
Yeah, what happened?
Somebody got fired for Michelangelo's David
Which is, what do we call it?
Is it neoclassical?
Is it drawing upon a classical tradition?
The Christians defeated the Romans
They know that the only thing that can stand against them
Is that queen, Lady Roma
They know their own texts acknowledged that it's her
It's her that will bring the spirit back
Yeah, it's her
And guess what?
She was celebrated in a mystery
Through the use of psychotropic drugs
We're gonna have a meeting after this
I will send, hopefully, we'll have a fantastic guest tonight
Talk to us about some neuropharmacology
I'm very much looking forward to it
I'm gonna zip my lips at it
I'm gonna listen to some great musings
There's some very intelligent people
That we're privileged to have time with
Yes, so thank you for coming
It's a satanic initiation tonight
For those of you who went to Wall Hall
And watched Neil as well, thank you
I appreciate your time
And Hail-Sate
That's better
