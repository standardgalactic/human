And then lastly, I think the big part of that is realizing that the credit for any victories are not mine.

Every word out of your mouth is counted for.
for every word. Let us see nemesis brought to the fore of our discussion tonight. Let
us see nemesis. Why it is that she is so important when you strip back all the gods, when you
strip back all the hopes and joys and all the trappings of civilization, when you strip
all that away. You are still left with a foundation and that foundation is nemesis.
We honor nemesis in that, there is a little bit of Greek in that video, untranslated.
Yes, and that little bit of Greek said that the one who bends the knee to nemesis, the one who
acknowledges nemesis is the wise one. What is nemesis doing and why is she so important? I want
to bring you this oracle and as we're doing so, we're doing so against the background of nemesis.
Nemesis was worshiped as one of those foundational deities, one of those forces that you cannot
come through this life without having encountered whether you want to declare yourself a monotheist
and say there are no gods, there is no justice, there is no retribution, there is only Allah,
there is only Jehovah, Yahoo and a son who was arrested in a public park with a naked kid.
Those of us who look back to the pagan origins of civilization as you and I sitting here today
in the 21st century know it. We must reconsider for one moment nemesis for without her, we have no
justice and when justice leaves, that's it, that's it, we're all done. Let's go to the, before we
bring up the clip, Chewie, let's go up to the first source, I want people to have this fresh.
I did it again, I did it again, can we go to the comments, pardon me, I worked it up there and I
got you all going, now look, you gotta take a break, look at some comments, I want to get two
comments, these are important, I want people to see these, what kind of comments are people giving,
here blow that up Chewie, I'll read it to you, yep exactly, good, thank you Matt, hey Dr. Arman,
