the celebrated gift of memory, now with that on your brain, with that on your brain,

of that power that we're all trying to get into the cave to partake in, to participate in,
to view, to behold, to absorb, that's what we're doing, that's the power, before we do so I want
you to see, I want to purify you, this kingdom from men, I want to purify you, so that you may
enter into it, let us consider nemesis, I'm surprised Chewie, look at that,
doubt as a pagan and reach out and feel, feel the temperature of nemesis, I want you to consider
who nemesis is, hit us with the next text Chewie, I want you to see, this is just an english translation
of a bit of knownness, but I wanted you to see a quick picture of her, she who has the
viperous feet, who is spitting poison afar, yeah okay, okay, round her neck, flowered 50 various
heads of wild beasts, some roared with lion's heads like the grim face of the riddling sphinx,
others were spluttering, you like that word, I didn't even know that was a word, spluttering,
I'll show you the word that isn't great, but okay, spluttering, sure, I think I get it from the mouth,
yeah, spluttering, there we go, spluttering foam from the tusks of wild boars, foam, I want you
to think about that foam, remember we're looking at her, we're looking at scootha, we're looking at
echidna and she has the foam on her mouth, like the other members of her temple household,
Cerberus is one of them, Cerberus is one, do you feel where we are, you know when you get to a place
that's foreign and the person that's there is a three-headed dog with poison froth on his mouth,
you know where you are, you know where you've come to, that's fantastic, let's keep going,
double shapes and I'm going to show you this in Greek, double shapes, she appeared a woman in
the middle of her body with clusters of poison spitting serpents for hair, for hair, look, keep
going down, the claws of her wide scattered hands were curved like crooked talons sickle from her
neck over her terrible shoulders with tall with tail raised high above her throat a scorpion with
an icy sting sharp wedded crawled and coiled upon itself, yes okay so you can see right away
