Thank you.
Welcome back to Lady Babylon.
This is Wednesday night Bible study.
Tonight we will be covering a range of topics that all center around the storm of the drugs
and the mystery.
We will be able to talk with a special guest Travis kitchens and hopefully make some commotion.
Well tonight I thought we would start out by giving the offerings of a dead mage, a dead
magus who washed ashore recently.
He's been dead for almost 2000 years but he was put on trial.
He was put on trial for magic and it turned out well.
He came through and he ended up writing a whole bunch of stuff and I just want to resurrect
his words.
This is a prayer and this is a prayer like I am sure you have never heard.
Let's hear the words of the magus himself.
Oh Queen of Heaven, whether you are bountiful series, the primal mother of crops who enjoy
at the recovery of your daughter, took away from men their primal animal fodder of acorns
and showed them gentler nourishment and now dwell in the land of elusis.
Our heavenly venus who at the first foundation of the universe united the diversity of the
sexes by creating love and propagated the human race through ever recurring progeny
and now you are worshiped on the island sanctuary Apophos or Phoebus' sister who brought forth
populous multitudes by relieving the delivery of offspring with your soothing remedies and
now are venerated at the illustrious shrine at Ephesus or dreaded proserpina of the nocturnal
howls who in triple form repress the attacks of ghosts and keep the gates to earth closed
fast roam through widely scattered groves and are propitiated by diverse rites.
You who illumine every city with your womanly light, I told you you never heard a prayer
