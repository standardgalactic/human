It's good, though. It's good. Pretty straightforward prose, right? Love it.
So this is Artaeus. And that first line is on satiriasis, right? On satiriasis.
And what is satiriasis? Well, the first thing he tells us is the satyrs are the priests of Dionysus.
Isn't that nice? And they're depicted always in the painting and in the sculptures, as you know.
They're depicted with Orthia... Idoia, excuse me. Orthia... Idoia, right? What is your Idoia?
What is your Idoia? Those are your genitalia. Genitalia. And how are their genitalia appearing?
Orthia, you know, you go get your T straightened and it's orthodonture. It's that straightening.
It's that tension. He tells us there's a tension. Boom. The Neura are tense. Okay?
That is your satyr. Your satyr has that tension. Excellent.
This is all the Xumbalani says. This is all that symbol, right?
This is all that quantum under-girding of the universe, right? It's in the form of that erection.
Okay. Okay. I think I'm seeing that. Right. Remember, boom, boom, boom.
Boom, boom. Off in the distance, right? You hear the... You hear him?
Getting the instruments going, right? Get your stuff on board.
By the way, he tells us what the drugs are that these people are using. He tells us what they are.
I got to tell you, since we're on our way, you're going to see us walking by some people that are naked.
Okay. They're covered on their genitalia and their planes.
They're planes? Planes. The land between the obstructions is the plane. Do you understand?
Yes. That's where you put... That's where you put it. Yes. That's where the spasms are.
Right. That land called the perineum. Have you been to the cafe perineum? Yeah.
Do you know what it smells like there? Smells like fine, fine incense. Yeah. Yeah.
Welcome to the Satyrs. Let's go back to the text. What else is Doc? Let's squeeze this Doc for all the information we can get out of him.
Doc, tell me something about these patients.
Let me blow this up.
Yeah. Tell me about these patients, Doc.
He says the thing that they're in, right, is a condition.
It's a condition. Most of his patients are boys, okay?
Younger boys, right around puberty. It's the group that he's dealing with because they are working initiations. Fantastic. Fantastic.
What does he say about satirizes? Satirizes is a horme. It's an impulse that is ungovernable.
Completely uncontrollable. It's an impulse. And it always leads to homilia. And you say what? The Satyrs are going to homilia. What is that?
That's union. Union. Can it mean sexual intercourse? Yes. Does it mean sexual intercourse? Yes.
It's the union. Okay. Thank you very much.
But he says the problem is, while they're in this state, even having intercourse repeatedly, body to body, he says, you know, Doc is trying to tell us, right?
Give us the biological details, Doc. He says they can be body to body, pounding, right?
And still, no relief. No relief. Still, they have that orthea, that stretching, that erectness. Yes.
Now, he says if this goes more than seven days, you'll kill them. You can't let somebody go for seven days. So if somebody comes on day five, right?
It's supposed to be over. The initiation is only three days, right? It's supposed to be done. But it's not. Drugs haven't worn off, right?
I mean, imagine having an erection for a week.
What are they putting in this stuff? Doc, tell us what are they putting in this stuff? They're putting in the plants that have the highest sky amine, the atropine, the ones that induce the scopolamine, the ones that induce the madness.
Is anybody surprised here? Everybody here knows that already. But they're also using some acacia, and they're using opium, and they're doing this thing where they cover the genitalia.
It's purple. I don't know. It's kind of like a mask. Yeah. Yeah. It covers the area, and the people who enter into the ecstasy.
Tell us, Doc, what kind of symptoms do we get when we're in bachic ecstasy? Are you guys ready for this? Are you guys ready?
Chewie, I hope you got a good picture of this.
Yeah. When we're about to enter into the visionary state, we start spasming in our genitalia and in that area that's just between the two obstructions.
It's the perineum. Right in that area, we get spasmings, and he says from the tip, from the organ, we'll drizzle out.
That's what it says. It's Ichmada. Drizzle off drizzlings. Drizzlings of what? Flegmatic material that has an appearance. It's clear like perspiration, and it drizzles out during the spasming right out of the organs.
Now, you think I've been talking about just men, right? Or just somebody with an erection, right? But the text Doc tells us, right? He tells us women have the same effects without the true satiriasis.
Yeah. Yeah. And then he gets a little bit negative and he gets into a negative mode. We have to tell him, stop. Stop, right? Let's see what's going on.
And he says, okay. What does it do to your brain, Doc? What does it do to your brain?
Aritaus. It's phrenoblaptic. I'm sorry. That was a little bit. Intriloquist. It's what?
Phrenoblaptic. It does what? It breaks your mind.
Isn't that nice? Phrenoblaptic. There's a word for this. Why is this even important? Because this is the process that they're entering into within the mystery operation.
They are losing it. They are losing it. You have to lose it to be born again, right? You have to lose it.
