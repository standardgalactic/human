No, I don't know who this...
Yeah, Paleo something.
Paleologous or something.
Pathlegone. I don't remember.
Did I write down his name?
He's not...
I'll thank you. That's rude of me.
I'm sorry. That's rude of me, too.
But here he is.
He wrote his action on Medea.
I was like, I don't care where his name is.
They didn't even know when he lived.
Okay, here he is.
Mr. Pea. Dr. Pea, can you tell us?
Look at the top. It's about Medea, right?
Perimedeus. Isn't that nice?
And so this is...
Yeah, this is about her abilities
and turning the old to the young
and how she had this thing going
where she didn't want to be recognized by the doctors, right?
For what she was doing.
Isn't that neat?
Oh, wow. She was doing independent stuff with drugs
on people, on people.
Fantastic. And what does it say that she's doing?
It says that she is using the incubations
where they're fumigating you.
Where they're filling the place with a smog, right?
And letting you...
Sometimes you're doing an intense, right?
Sometimes it's just in the open air with a giant, you know,
barbecue-like altar full of bricks of incense
and it's just... It's like, you know,
somebody don't call the fire department, right?
That kind of thing. You know what I mean?
But sometimes it's under a little tent, too.
My cityans like to do that.
They were like, let's go under a tent.
Everybody get a shower together, right?
A shower of smoke.
That's the city.
The city on a seetha, right?
Or skutha is the Greek color.
Like or seetha. Much better.
That's what they call medea. That was her title.
Seetha. Excellent. Excellent.
What happens here, though?
Medea gets involved with some fumigations.
Yeah. And more drugs.
They talk about a couple of dyes.
Yeah. She discovers there's certain colors
that can be used in a medicinal way.
