Yeah.
Yeah.
We want to look back and we want to see what the original are.
We can't get there without the saders.
If you can please in comments or in some sort of, you know, communication that we can have with each other, just put in the comments.
If you can, if you can tell me what it is that a group of drug wielding women and where's this coming from?
This is Amazonian baby.
What kind of women are these?
Let's just paint a portrait of them real quick.
I mean, come on.
How bad is that?
That's not a bad date.
You know what I mean?
That's not a bad date.
We can paint a portrait of her.
She is one of these civilians.
She's one of these Amazonians.
Her breasts were both burnt.
Not one of them.
Both of them.
You know, seared when they're fairly soon after they're born, after they make it through that period of where they're not sure if they're going to make or not.
Put them in the cold river and freeze them, pull them out if they're hardy enough to make it.
Good.
Put them in the fire.
Yeah.
Take them through the ritual.
Can they make it through?
Oh, this one didn't make it.
What are these people doing?
Did you and I are born into a generation of untested.
You realize that, right?
Untested.
When you're one of these Amazonian women.
You're not.
You don't have plans to get married.
Right.
You have plans to rule and to administer and to bring order and justice.
Isn't that nice?
And to kill enemy.
You got to kill three of them before you can get, you can get into a baby making partnership with a dude that we can dispose of.
Right.
He's done.
Or you can keep him and give him the baby.
He'll raise it.
Right.
He'll raise the baby.
And if she gets to a certain age where she can now compete and be involved with the horses and everything, then we bring her into society.
Right.
Yes.
Are you afraid of this woman?
I hope you are.
I hope everybody out there is afraid of this woman because that's the woman they're talking about.
So you take a group of these women.
