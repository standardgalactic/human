Because you rejuvenate my splonkna
What is going on between these people?
Give me the next one, let's find out
Watch people, hang on
For those of you
Whoops, for those of you
Who are interested in
Mysteries, puzzles
That kind of thing
Mystery in a modern context
This is it, watch how this
Watch the flow of this tonight
And where you end up
It may make you sick
It may make you a little bit sick
Are you ready? Splonkna
You know you love it
Was Paul talking about
Were the people who were saved
What are we?
They're what? They're inward parts
Especially the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys
Which in sacrifices were reserved to be
Eaten by the sacrifices
At the beginning of their feast
Okay, we got organs
Any part of the inwards
Spleen
Uterus
You know they use this word for uterus
There's like 18 words for uterus
In ancient Greek
And they're all like
What? The matrix
Oh god, it's gorgeous, this is one of them
This is an organ that you eat
Why? When you're trying to prophesy
You saw all the vampire
Enthusiasts out there just going
Huh? Right?
Oh, watch the blood baby
Give me the next one
They're also the children
Look at the Greek people
What are children called?
They're called those organs
That the prophets like the hadus specs
Eat
We call them children
Nummy num num
Give me the children
Wait a minute
Is this really going to go there?
Is it really? Watch
Just watch
He's the one saying it now
For those of you who are getting men
He's the one who's saying this stuff
Not me
Right?
I'm just here because this place belongs
To the devil
Fantastic, give me the next one
Give me the next one
You can even turn that word into a verb
You can splunk mail or someone
You mean you can eat the innards of a victim
After a sacrifice? Yeah
But look at number two
You know what happens when you do so?
You become a splunk noscopia
Enthusiast
Not a splunk noscopiast
What is that?
Look, I'm telling you
These are big Greek words
Big ones
Open up your mind
It means to prophesy from the innards
From the innards
From the innards
Okay
Is anybody else getting hungry?
Let's see how this works
Give me the next one
I'm ready for it
What is that splunk known?
It's the seat of your affections
It's your anger
It's that drive
I want you to look at a couple of lines
That you see in here
It's of love
Of love
You're splunking out of something to do with your love
And Paul is talking about this?
Yep
Watch what happens
Give me the next one
One of the lines
Has, go back
It's the seventh
Look at the seventh line down
Now, Duckdale's Dan
Or Captain Kip
Came up and said
Hey, none of this stuff is overlapping
And these words don't exist
And, you know
They don't matter to us Christians
Right?
Look what's going on
When we try to explain Paul
We get drawn right into it
You get linguistically drawn
I'm sorry you guys didn't know this
It's not
A magic trick
There are those
Who can do it and who can
Read the text
And there are those who don't
They just don't have it and they don't do it
Some of those that don't do it
Like to pretend that they do
And that's where I come in
And that's where any
Any of you who wants to meet me
On the field of battle
On one, I'll take your apology
And I will shred it
You'll be so glad to be done
With that interview
Oh God, give me the next one
Give me the next one, I love this
I'm getting bloodthirsty
Look at Honoi's travel
What's it mean to go to madness
And we see it in Euripides Bacchai
Having been put into that
State of madness
But here's the quote that he has
And it talks about
Love and the splank
Now with the love, give me the next one
And here's the problem
Look at the second line in Greek
Starts on the first line after
The semicone
Paidos
Paidos who posplank noisi
Ehipothon
That's theocritus
You see the splank
Noisi there
What's he talking about?
He's talking about a dude
Who has
Desire
Under the control
Of that little boy's
Splanknon
Let me say it again
And this is
Hellenistic by the way
This is Hellenistic, third second century
Right
BC, so okay
Okay, I'm getting it
This is the birth of the
Koine
That became so popular
There's other Koines, there's an Ionian
Koine at an earlier time
Whatever, there's Dorian
This is the Koine form of
Greek that became very popular
And this is how they're using these words
I am going
I am going to get
Desire from
From
That splanknon of
