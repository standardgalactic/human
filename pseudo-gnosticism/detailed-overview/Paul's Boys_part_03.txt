The kid
Who is saying this?
Couple of rappers
Couple of rappers
Yeah, in antiquity
Very famous ones too
And they're talking about another famous dude
Who sings about astronomy
And he's got
An interest in this girl
But you know
You know
There's always that burning
That
Burning for the splanknon
You know what I mean
Paul knows what that is
Paul
Confesses it
Give me the next one
Paul was one thing, he was honest baby
Yeah, we won't give any
Give me that, there we go
Here's the conversation
I just want you to see
He loves that myrtle, is her name
Right, just as much as goats love the spring
Right, but
What happens
He has that
Pulthorn desire
And it's driven
By that splanknon
Of the child
Give me the next
And there's the line
For those of you who just want it, I'm not making it up
There it is
He has that desire
And he's driven by that splanknon
Of the kid
I just said it three times
It's got to happen, poof
Out of somewhere thin air
That was with Jesus in the Garden of Gethsemane
Hit me with the next one, Chewie
Now, who are we talking about
We're going to investigate now
The splanknon
And what it is
And what Paul is saying about it
And what he's revealing
For the first time tonight
Look at who we're talking about
We're talking about
Cultists
Who were active in the mystery
Like Heracles
Aristophanes
Clearly
Pointed out
As a victim
Of the dude
That
Educated
Him
And that dude was
Kyron
And he had a whole bunch of other students too
Very famous ones
And what does Aristophanes say
He puts it in the mouth of Heracles
Who's knocking down my door
What do you
What do you come here like some kind of
Kintauron
You come here like his master did
Because what are they known for
They're known for their brutality
They're known
For their excessive
Brutality
And uncontrollable passions
A lot of times they're presented
With the ears
Of saders
Yeah, why who are the saders
Those are the guys with the constant
You know we don't have them anymore
But it's a constant they take a pill
And they get a constant erection
Yes
Yeah
Who's this guy
Kyron let's go to the next one please
Nope
That's not the right one
Nope that's not the right one
That's it
Well we know
What do we know about the Kintauron
Well
We know that somebody they're
At least now I want you to focus too
Focus on the anthropology here
This is not we don't care about myth
We're historians
We want that
Actuality
Just look at it anthropologically
What do you call somebody
When you call them a Kintaurophonus
You call them one who slays
Centaurs
Okay
Did you know
Heracles was the pedarast killer
He was
Give me this heroes next thing
Give me this heroes next clip
Watch what happens people
Kintauros
Well they're a savage race right
There's that brutality again and they give you
The place that they live
Again anthropologically just pay attention
What's going on
Oh wait a minute what's the last word
In that paragraph
H-S-C-H
That's a Seekius
You mean he talks about what a Kintauron
Is or what a Kintauros
Is yes he does
Look at he says Briggins
Briggins
Give me the next one
What do you mean Briggins
I don't trust these Victorians
They always screw things up so I'm going to the source
Victorians
You're so proper
You can't even talk about the
Pedarast without obscuring the history
Feel it
Feel it
Cross the pond
Feel it
Kintauros
Who are they
Everybody look at the first word
Leicester
Now for those of you who haven't been around
Satanic initiation for long
Lady
Haven't been watching Lady Babylon for long
For those of you who caught up
The last couple of weeks
What are we talking about
This is an ancient
Greek
Lexicographer
Who is defining Greek for us
So that we don't have to go
Through the Victorians
And all their privy business
Right
And all the psychological stuff
They had going on
We'll go right back to those crazy Greeks
And here he defines it
Kintauros
Leicester
Isn't that nice
That's the plural for Leicester
Who was
The
Kintauros
Jesus Christ
Paul the apostle
They
Were Kintauros
And that's why Jesus comes into the garden
