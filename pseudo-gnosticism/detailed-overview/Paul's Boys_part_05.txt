Now as funny as they switched into Latin
So it wouldn't be dirty
Yeah
What are the pudenda?
We call them the pudenda too
Look it up
And mulliebria just means of women
It's the female pudenda
That pudenda comes from the word pudor
Pudor is
Something that you hide
It's how you hide
It's the hidden bits
Look what they're doing
Maybe those Brits with their privy parts
Were closer
Than we think
Nice job right
One for me for spanking Brits so much
Oh you gotta realize that
Sometimes they get it
Oh privy parts
Oh back one
What else is it?
It's the male Eidoyon
Wait a minute
This thing that the devil has
It's called the bull
It's also the pudenda
And it's the Eidoyon of the dude
The Eidoyon
Is the
What would you call it?
I think the scientific term is penis
Yes it is
It is
Yes
Okay
Let's find what the cojone is
Cause that sound a little bit rough
See what we're going
We gotta track Paul through his word
What is it?
We found it
It's the perineum
It's the perineum
For the scientists in the room
You probably just
Right
What is the perineum?
The perineum is the space
Between
Your anus
And your private parts
Wait
The bull
Are you gonna watch my
Splachna
Okay
Very bottom here
Second to last line
Bottom
Your glutes
Okay
We are in
We are sitting there
Hovering above
The perineum
Watching
The mystery
Sorry
Okay
Give me the next one
Look at what happens
The centaurs
You can talk about their clan
Or you can talk about their blood
That's interesting
Not really
But I wanted you to see that there's famous
Famous
Centaur blood
You didn't think we were going to get into the mystery cult
Without getting in the blood
Did you?
The centaur is that savage race
It's that half human being
Half horse thing
But then look at number four
Not only
Okay, let's wait on the pie that I'll stay
But look at number two at the very bottom
The pudenda once again
What is the fascination with these people?
Well, anthropologically, look what they're doing
You see exactly the language
Betrays everything about
Who the culture
You know, who the people are
Betrays everything
A pie that asks this
From the brutal sensuality
Ascribed to the centaurs
Did you know what that centaur did
To Heracles?
Do you know what he did to Jason?
You want to know why Jason knows drugs so well?
Some drugs you can be shown
Oh, my God
Sometimes I can't
I can't do it, he'll say it
And I can't do this
I'm just like, okay, demons
Thank you for the assistance
Thank you very much, but it's getting
So gross
That I don't want to continue
It's for you, congregation
That we continue forward
We press on
Watch what happens, because we're going to see what Paul does to this kid
Just wait
Give me the next one
What's a pie that I'll stay
We're going to go on to the next one
What's that pie that I'll stay
That's the lover of boys, mostly in a bad sense
We've seen this, right
Oh, yeah
Give me the next one
And you can pie that I'll stay
You can perform the action
Right, it's a
Quite a wide-spread
Concept here
To be a lover of the boys
Again, these
Are the concepts
Embedded in what Paul is using
And when I show you, it's going to
Here we go, hit the next one
Mmm, boom, boom
What are the quintriadae
What are the quintriadae
I just want you to notice, these are priests and Athens
Right
Who drove, that quintron is that
Spike again, that thorn
Right, and what does that have to do with any of this
Hit the next one
Hit the next one, oh
Because the quintriadae
Are based on the same root as the quintauros
Yeah
And what do these people do
They're those who are in charge of
Or who are
Overseers of
The mysteries
When you hear in antiquity
A dude
Who's with a kid
And he's talking
About the mysteries
Congratulations
You've made it to sacred ground
You've made it to the place
Of the paiderastes
You can call them
Quintauros
Or you can call them
Jesus
No, it doesn't matter
The language
Betrays the fact that this
Friggin cosmos
Is ruled
By people who
Believe in a pedarast
Moses
Show me your backside
God
Show me your backside, you want to know the only thing that
