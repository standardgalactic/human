That's what they say
If they know people
Are listening
What's the raw translation?
I'm gonna give you erotic favors
And I've got a kid here
And that kid
Is useful
And I want you to take care of
Yeah
Fantastic
Alright, you can see how the lay stays are working
You thought gangsta P
You thought gangsta P was a little more intellectual
A little more highbrow
No, no, no, no, no, he's a lay stay
It's just like the rest of him
Give me the next one, Chewie
We're almost finished
I just want to leave you with a couple of thoughts
Here's another boy in there
He's a younger guy, right?
But okay, I just wanted to see there's another one
Give me the...
Just so many of these
So many of these
What's the purpose of all this?
Paul spills the beans in Philippians
He wants that power
He wants his erection
And that
Joining
Of the passions
Yeah
He's gonna morph himself
He's gonna take himself
Into that death
Do you know what you do with your petarast?
You get
Your mortality
Burned off
With petarast
You know who ultimately made
The immortal
Guess who?
Was Chiron
Through his knowledge of the drugs
Finally
People are gonna say, look what he's doing
Look what he's doing
He's talking about all these people on drugs
He's talking about all these Christians
All these Jews, all these people throughout
History using these drugs
For their religions
There was a time
Nobody ever
Nobody ever teaches on Mark 321
Nobody ever teaches on Mark 321
Do you know what this says?
The dude's family
Came after him
Because he was out
Of his mind
And who's the dude we're talking about?
We're talking about that drug
Using Jesus Christ
Give me the last one
Just so you know I'm not making this up
Here's the NIV translation
When his family
Heard about this
They went to take charge of him
For they said, dude is out of his mind
I'm telling you
It uses the same
Verb that's involved
With ecstasy
The state of being
Under the control of a drug
Jesus Christ had to be
Picked up by his family
Because he's so drugged
He's talking nuts
If you haven't been there
You don't know
This is the dirt
This is the dirt from antiquity
Your religions
You monists
Your religions are built
On this dirt
Have a good night
Thank you for coming
And everybody
Crash that
Server tomorrow
Come in and ask questions
Of the graduates who are there
Oh, and it's at 12
East, no, Central
12th Central
Check it out
And ask them
Tell them, hey
I'm having problems with this now
They are your TAs
When I was at university
This is the system
Professor
Lecture
Laboratories
TAs
To help you
People who have been there
For people who are calling
Or sending me questions
About textbooks
All of those questions can be answered
Not only that, but those TAs
Can tell you, they can say
Do not buy
A biblical Greek textbook
Our material is far, far more
Rigorous, complete
And classical
Don't
This kind of thing, they can all tell you
They're veterans, I salute them
I salute Nancy
I salute Ion
We're supposed to be getting fish back
Fish
You guys love fish
Ask for fish
Okay, thank you very much
For coming tonight
I don't want to waste any of your time
So that's everything I prepared for you
I hope you have seen Paul
I hope you have seen the mystery
I hope there is coming a day
When this friggin' world
Gets punched in the friggin' nads
And wakes up
Hail Satan
Just give me a taste
Of hot purple
Kiss me in the smoke room
Scythian arches of doom
Spells, weaves, carpets and looms
My D.M.L.C.
My Athena
Death of a creeper
Fashion gibbets
For child interferers
Sleep with the devil
And then you will pay
Sleep with the devil
And you'll be taken away
You must pay
When you enter the gates
A Babylon
For all that you did
The throne
Laces, wrecks, I.M.B
Cash and checks
Doctors do dreams
Purple rain
Athena doing her thing
You can hear me knocking at the door
I'm in the purple suit
Statenalia
Here we go
Wolf's brain
Theory act flow
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
Perfume intoxication
