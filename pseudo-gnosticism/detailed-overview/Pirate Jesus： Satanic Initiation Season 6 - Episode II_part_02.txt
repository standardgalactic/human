you who are waiting for Jesus and his naked boy, just wait. Just wait. It will make sense. It will
make sense. We have you have your back. Fantastic. So what else can Herodotus tell us here about this
tribe? What are they doing? They have tattoos and they think it is, it is. Oh, I hate to use this
word. It's highborn. Highborn. The eugenics. Oh, goodness. It's just right there. So they think the
tattoos are for highborn people. And those who don't have those who aren't highborn, they don't wear
the marks. Right. Fantastic. Are you getting along in the party so far? Welcome. Welcome. Fantastic. Look at
this word stigma. Stigma. This is the tattoo. Right. Right. Look at it. Number two. It's also the mark
on the skin of the dragon. It's the mark. It's the mark on the skin of the dragon. Yeah, it's the mark
of the dragon. Yes. Go to the next one, please. Yep, that one. Go back to that one. There's still some
good info in this. Let's squeeze. Let's squeeze Herodotus. So and what else? They think that working
the ground is for morons. So they make their living. If you look at that last line, they make their
living from war and leistos and from being a leistis. So what is their occupation? What is their
occupation? They go around plundering. Yes. Yes. Babylonian hordes filled with ranks. Rank after
rank of these horsemen. These horsemen. Do you remember guys? The prophet. I think you say you
mispronounce it. It's something like a Habakkuk or something, but it's ambakum. And what did ambakum say?
We're going to see ambakum in just a minute. Just sit down. Sit down. We'll get to bring up the next
one. That was Herodotus. Every round of applause for Herodotus. Now, you want to argue with some
sources, argue with some sources, but where we are is we're in the middle of that camp. And I still
got to take you to the grotto. I promise you something great on this date. I'm going to take you to the
grotto. I know. I know. People say if he says he's going to take you to the grotto, it doesn't mean
what you think it does. Yeah. Yeah. This Greek is gorgeous. This Greek is absolutely gorgeous. Okay.
Bring it up. Bring it up. I promise these people action tonight. Where's the take the banner down
and bring that up. Perfect. Thank you, Chewie. This is Plato. I like to kick in a little Plato
every once in a while, but he says, look, get cut me a break. Right. And tell me how this works
with these groups of people, the soldiers, the laystates and the kleptos. Oh, wait a minute,
the kleptos, who are they? That's the word for thief. So when the Christians try to translate
into English, this word is thief. They don't know because they don't read these texts, right? Who?
Which one? Can you tell me which one of your pastors has ever read Plato? Okay. Now, I'm not a
big Plato fan. Right. And that's unusual. That's unusual for somebody with a classics background,
but I can't stand Plato. Yeah. Yeah. But anyhow, let's not bash Plato. He had a muse. So, you know,
let's let's honor him that way. But what what you're seeing now from Herodotus,
yeah, is the source of this thing called the laystates. And they're different from thieves.
Right. Some people, the Christians wanted to translate this so bad as thief. They did. They
tried thief, robber and conspirator, conspirator. This is not, this is not a conspiracy.
Yeah. These are cultures. This is a group of Thracians who do this, right?
Remember the story we had a long time ago in the beginning about the Thracian pirate?
Who captured that beautiful young boy. He put that young boy to sleep. And when the boy woke up,
he was a new creation.
That pirate cut off his testicles.
Because some Unix choose and some don't.
Yeah. Yeah. There's a reason the bandage was on the private parts of the naked boy that was with
Jesus when he was arrested. There's a reason Mark tells you I'm bringing it up. I'm bringing it up.
It's coming up in just a minute. Let me not keep, let me not. Go ahead. Get hit me with the mark now.
Just jump ahead. Pull up Mark. Yep. Thank you, Chewie. Go for it. Blow that up. Here he is.
There's our nannieskos, right? With that diminutive for little boy, right? Because they do it before
