Musa Natha Medwa
I'm a powerful dreamer
On you I put a spell
Don't wait on the triple beam
Purple cup pressed down
Full of nova flow and wealth
Green and green jelly bean
Dance with the muse
Come with me
Point of pendant ring
Elemental peas
They love the kachinga ling
Purple paint base
Down with the yellow brick road
Charlemagne sugar ring
I'm laying
This dream is in mind
It's yours
And I'm honored to be in it
Rock on Hail Satan
With a cup full of violet
Vagina juice
You know what to do
Thank you Teddy Bays
For singing us in
I love this tonight
We're gonna go somewhere
Just you and me
Every minute of this
Every minute of this
I have some really, really tasty stuff
For you tonight
It's delicious
I want to tell you that I was just
Interviewed today
By classical
Wisdoms
Anya and oh god
One of the discoveries
That we'll make
So tune in
When you get a chance
Tonight I want to be
A little more intimate
Just between us
About halfway through
I want to hit you then
With a couple of comments
That you know
I just have to address
Just a couple of things I have to address
Don't worry, don't worry
It'll be lovely
Let's get started tonight
We're gonna make our way
Into the purple
I've got to show you
Some of those
Who were using and making
And distributing
The burning purple
I've got to show you tonight
Where would I start
Such a journey
You know what we're looking for
We're looking for pirates
We're looking for pirates
And tonight
We're gonna find pirates
Burning purple
What was that?
What was that?
We'll even find
Achilles
Fantastic
We're going in deep
Are you ready for this?
I'm gonna give you some of the gory details
And I want you to be
I want you to be satisfied
Because you came here to be satisfied
You didn't want
Look, what's he doing?
Chewie, what is he doing?
Because the ship is finally there
I want to
Pull you out of that ship tonight
And I'm gonna push you into Hyman
Hyman
What did you say?
I thought we were talking about
Pirates
We are, yes
And drug using
Pirates from antiquity
Yes, yes, we are
But we have to go to the Hyman
Who is
The child
Who is that blessed child, Hyman?
Who is that blessed child, Hyman?
Chewie, did we get any
Pickups of Hyman? Here we go
What is Hyman doing?
He's a great guy
You would love him
Absolutely loved him
How would you know about him?
You'd know about him, leave him up there
Because you'd know about Hyman
From the wedding songs
The wedding songs
The Greeks doing
They're chanting
Hyman
Who's his buddy?
Eros
