Not really a woman
Dressed up like a priestess
Girl

Why did he do that?
Don't worry about why he did that
Let's see Achilles, bring out Achilles
Go ahead, fire up Achilles
So
What Eustathias is telling

His official business? I want him up here
Doing his priestess thing
Because he's being raised with priestesses
Everybody knows

Beautiful priestess

It's another name of the many named
Queen of Babylon
Day to me
What does that mean? You know what that means?
Oh, you're gonna love this, are you ready?
Get ready for this
This is the girl
Who brings slaughter
This is the killer
Oh

And she happens to be
One of the priestesses
Who is shielding Achilles
As a preteen
And teen
Oh, okay

What do you think happens?
They fall in love
Right?
They succumb
To the flames of Eros
And Medea
Yeah
And Achilles
End up
Creating a union
That breaks all of time
It breaks all of time
What can come after it is only
It's wake
It shatters everything

Physian Fields
As the bride
Of Achilles
It's Medea
Do you know who it was?
That stood on the walls of Troy
Wait, what?
Stood on the walls of Troy
Shhh
Stood on the walls of Troy
And looked
At Achilles
And he looked up at her on the walls
And he said, that's you
It's you whose image
Has been in my mind
You have projected it to me
Wait, what's her name?
Helen

Being a pirate
But
