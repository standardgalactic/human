His own family line
Do you know what the name means?
Pirates
Yeah, he points it out
He says, but
He is a pirate
And
Odysseus
No
Every classicist
Sphincter
You could hear the chair
It was squeak
Why?
Because Odysseus, my God
You might as well see he was a drug-collecting
Freak
He was
He was a pirate, don't you know?
Ithaca is set up
Eustatius, thank you for telling us this
As a matter of fact, Eustatius
Give us the next one
What else?
That was Odysseus, by the way
He's a smug
He's the one who comes and gets Achilles
Pulls him out of the priesthood
Oh, God
And yeah
Bring us up the next one, please
Boom
And boom
This is the passage
That we're all concerned about
That Ezekius is telling us about
Okay, it's from Homer
And what does it say?
Because, you know, now's a good time
To question these people and figure out who they are
Since, you know, they ate their meal
And they're good
And he says, oh, strangers, tell us who you are
Where'd you come from?
Sailing over the sea
And, you know, what kind of thing do you do?

To their neighbors

More information

And here I am and my sheep

When you infiltrate this cult

If you see Hyman
Fortunately for us
Hyman is there to kill us

Kill us all
Only
Only this kid would be able to do that
Oh, God
Let's keep going
He leaves the picture up there
Yeah, oh, wait a minute
How old is this kid, right?
Yeah, exactly
Let's go
Boom, next one
Yep, we got it
I wanted to show you this, look
He says here, this is miraculous text here
Seriously, people, blow that up
This is miraculous text
Look at it
Oh, my God, they're trafficking in souls
And what does it mean Ezekius?
Tell us what that trafficking
In souls means
Right, he says they're doing it

Went away, a whole bunch of
