This is the kind of love that existed
Between Achilles and
Patroclus
Yeah
Stop
We're in a camp
You know they're pirates
We have to be able to see this
To be able to bring back the polis
Right? And bring back the
Athana
Love it
Hear how I drop to Doric
From that Athenian A to an O
Love it
Let's go to the next one
I got a little bit more information for everybody
Is this the last?
And Jesus, no?
No, okay
Look at the word laystace
It's sitting there
Right on the second line
He's saying
What you come out here for
Oh, you're big weapons
You're Machaeron and you're
Solon
What are they?
Swords and
Warhammers
For lack of a better term
Oh, God
Because you're a pirate
You don't do this half
You know, half whatever
Baked
It has to be real, man
Okay
Go to the next one
What about these laystaces?
One more
Okay, now Ezekius goes on
To talk a little bit
This isn't Ezekius, this is Dyschordes
But Ezekius goes on
I want you to hear this
He goes on to talk about
The Greeks themselves
From the earliest time
Those who were Palaeo
These are the people being influenced
Most heavily by the Pulaskeans

These people

Greeks
Because of their language
He said these people

From what?
Lestea
Piracy
You mean
That the earliest history
Those Bronze Age Greeks
Those people
Were pirates
Trafficking and people
Did Herodotus tell you?
Didn't he tell you?
It all starts with
The abduction of Medea
And then there's
Everyone else

People getting taken
From places
Being traded by those
Who use the purple
Yeah
You know what Achilles does
As a pirate
He takes booty

And from her
