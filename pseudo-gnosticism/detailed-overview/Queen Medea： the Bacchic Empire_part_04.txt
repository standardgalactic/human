Diodorus tells us that Cersei was given the marriage to a king of the Saramations.
Some people, he says, call these people Scythians. We know that Medea had her own bodyguard,
twelve of these Scythian women, skilled in drug knowledge. But Cersei killed off the king of the
Saramations with drugs, assumed control of the kingdom, and did many bad and cruel things for

to a deserted island and took with her to that place all the women who followed her.
Some people say she came to Italy, to the very place we call today Kierkayen.
