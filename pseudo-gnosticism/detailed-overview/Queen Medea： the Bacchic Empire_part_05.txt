It was there on that island that she met Odysseus. She poisoned him and his men.
He was given an antidote against her drugs by the god Hermes, disguised as a young boy.
Diodorus tells us that Medea learned the art of drugs from both her mother Hecate and her sister
Cersei, but he adds that Medea did not have the same intent as they did. She was not cruel.
Instead, she tried to rescue strangers who had been taken captive.
Sometimes she asked her father directly to be merciful to the ones who were about to be put
to death to give them salvation. Sometimes she arranged to have them released herself.
It may be that her father Eetes was the source of cruelty, but it also may be that her mother
was the one who had established the right to kill strangers and therefore influenced Eetes.
