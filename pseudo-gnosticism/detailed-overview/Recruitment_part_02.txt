and it's used a lot with love, the person who is in love burns, the person who is in love burns,
the por fura that purple is being used to affect mental state, and I'm going to show you the Greek in just a second,
so you'll see it when we're in this drug party, mystery cult, right, get your terms right, go back, give me the next one,
okay, so where are we going to start, we're going to start with the Bible, right, and I just want you to see where we've come,
where have we come, we've come to the cemetery with tombs people, do you see all the tombs, around why,
because this is the place that Jesus and his crew get down to business, this is where they do it, are you ready,
and what happens, we see a scene here of a bunch of women who went to a tomb and came running out in ecstasy,
and tromos, you know what tromos is, that's a shaking man, you've got to get really messed up,
you've got to, I'm terrified, I'm terrified, what's going on, did you see that, what was it, terrified these cultists, right,
okay, let's go a little bit deeper, see what kind of drugs they're using, that was the Gospel of Mark by the way,
give me the next one, Mary Magdalene was in there, what are these people in, they're in ecstasy people, this is the Bible,
look at that last word ecstasy, that's what the people are in, Mary is in it, why, has to do with little boy,
has to do with little boy and tomb, can you believe that, let's see what happens next, let's see what happens next,
excuse me, Chewie you're going to have to keep up with this, people are going to start getting, you're not going to believe this,
but just look at the text that I'm giving you, okay, this is Mark 16-6, yeah, he says to them, so they're going into the tomb,
right, and there's a kid there, they're going into the tomb and there's a kid there, where Jesus was,
and he says, you're looking for Jesus, right, from Nazareth, he is awake, he is awake, and he got up and walked out of here,
he walked out of here, wait a minute, Jesus Christ, the dude that was just crucified, yes that's what he says,
the crucified dude, he got up and he walked away, the word that he's using is a ghetto, he's going to be using that all the time,
he's not here, he's not here, he did what, what does that mean to a ghetto, what does it mean, it means to revive,
he revived Jesus Christ with the stars in his hand, he revived, he revived after that crucifixion,
do you remember where we were Jesus when you first offered me drugs, do you remember Jesus Christ where we were,
Oklahoma teachers, catch this one, do you remember where we were Jesus Christ when you first offered me drugs,
I remember you said something about a snake and then you said you were going to give me death inducers but it wouldn't hurt me,
do you remember, what was Jesus Christ doing on that cross, he was dying, he was dying,
and did you see, he yelled something out and then plonk, he was dead and the Roman guards were like dude, he's too early,
he's already dead, we can't even break his legs, here poke him, they poked him with the spear, do you know I have read Galen,
people, congregation, trust me, repairing a wound from a sword, a spear, a dagger, they've got it all, right,
those are surgeries that they're performing all the time, do they have such a high success rate as us, probably not, probably not,
but Galen has all sorts of stuff but I had to clean out wounds from arrows, from spears, how to suture them, using some kind of thing like cat gut,
yeah, it's fantastic, incredible, incredible, and so wait a minute, you mean Jesus who they took off the cross,
when he entered that death, you mean there are people who are saying that the dude got off and walked away and who's saying it,
