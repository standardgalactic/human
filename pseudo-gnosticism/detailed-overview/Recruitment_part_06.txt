basically the Mediterranean becomes the place where we're going to civilize, darn it, you know what we're going to do, we're going to build you latrines, you dummies, you can poop in a latrine, not in street,
so you know it's funny, it's not a matter of race or gender, it's a matter of cleaning up your poop, that's civilization, civilization, are you ready, we're ready to go back, are you ready to go back everybody, give me the, oh for my, all I want is to talk to you, I'm going to say happy birth,
Robin, are you kidding, that's fantastic, Robin Mungle, happy birthday Robin Mungle, happy birthday, that's fantastic, wouldn't you like to say something, Chewie says R, right, that's nice, that's nice, I love that, yeah, your birthday wish, what's your birthday wish, don't tell us, don't tell us, send it to me,
okay, okay, are you ready, what's going to happen, what's going to happen, look at the last word in the first line, moustikos, right, he says, Clement says to his body, he says you know what, I'm really glad that you didn't reveal any of that stuff, and he says by the way, Mark, he's not revealing, he's not opening up the mystic side of the gospel,
right, he's not, he's doing what he thinks he has to do, which is with what are useful, things that are useful for the catechumen, for the who, the catechumen, who are the catechumen, they're the boys, don't you understand, supply and demand, they're the boys that are being supplied to the cult,
they get in trouble in Alexandria because the Roman authorities come in and start arresting Christians right and left, why, because they're taking kids off the street, boys, they're taking homeless children that are male off the street, and guess what they're doing with them, I'm going to show you what Jesus does with them,
and why they're doing this in Alexandria, now Mark was smart enough not to reveal this as Clement, Mark was smart enough, give the next one, I know people, what does Mark have to end up doing, he's going to have to end up creating a pneumatic gospel, right, the people who are defending the rights of initiation that are taking place,
these people have to have a justification, so we create the apostles, the people who are involved, the early church fathers, they're involved in this process of making a pneumatic gospel, it's an Alexandrian thing, a pneumatic gospel, right,
now notice who's this for, who's the pneumatic gospel for, you know, if you go to a church, you go to a rescue mission or something like that, you go to, you know, Joel Osteen or something, and you want to accept Christ as your savior, right, that's the gospel, you're giving the gospel,
but at the time that Jesus and his people are doing what they're doing, this is the world you have, you have an inner mystery that is performed, and we're going to leave it out of the gospel, but we're going to leave enough signs in the gospel that people can see it,
the naked kid that was with Jesus when he was arrested with the bandage, that was on, that was on mark, that was meant to give you that which is for the initiated, that's what that says,
it's useful for them, for those who have been initiated, do you understand, so there's Christianity and the faith, and there is an inner mystery that involves drugs, Christ thing and sex, and the Romans eventually end up busting things up, causing a problem,
because the Christians are telling each other, right, don't do this, don't go to this, right, that Jezebel, who is she, who is she, Jezebel, who is she, she's doing this,
people are going there, they're eating her flesh, drinking her blood, all right, that is reserved only for the inner circle, it's reserved only for the elites, those who have been through it, those who have been initiated,
okay, we start off with those what, they start off with boys, children, Christianity is a religion of, I can't say the word on YouTube, it sounds like a fruit, yeah, banana-ing, it's not banana-ing, children, yeah, yeah, that's the way,
that is the way, see, the world is just now figuring out what it means to Christ, eyes are opening, people write to me every day and say, you know what, this stuff didn't make sense until, until you plug it into this, yeah, exactly, that's the history, and that's what our job is,
is to get you that history, give me the line, give me, there's a couple more, yeah, what, yeah, okay, and what are we hiding, people, look at the first word on the third line,
what are we hiding in the Gospels, we're hiding the fact that Jesus was a hierophant, a hierophant, that's what this text says, we're guarding the fact that Jesus was a hierophant, what does a hierophant do,
a hierophant will take you somewhere and do things to you to cause you to enter a state where you will be able to talk to angels, that's what a hierophant does, a hierophant will purify, will baptize you, will purify you,
a hierophant will cause the heavens to be opened in front of you, that's what hierophants do, they cause statues to speak, have you ever seen a statue motivated, they call it motivating statue, have you ever seen a motivated statue, that's a statue that speaks,
hierophants can get you to that place where you can see the statue, speak, isn't that fantastic, I love that, I love that, so what are they hiding, what does that text say they're hiding, they're hiding the fact that Jesus is a hierophant,
Okay, if you thought Jesus was just, oh the victim lamb of God, blah, hoo-ha-boo-ha, gets up on the cross, all of a sudden he's dead and everybody's like, huh, wait a minute, he shouldn't be dead yet, right, that dude just got whacked by some powerful force, right, the lightning struck him,
somebody call scootha, who's that, she's the one who carries around all of that star, yeah, gives you the bath in the start, makes me feel better, does it make you feel better?
Gaius, get in on it Gaius, here we go, that's exactly where we have to be is in that world, in their world because it was the world, the fantasy world that you have of Jesus walking around, did you ever hear Jesus fart anywhere, no, you never, how come, Jesus never farts anywhere, you never seen He farting anywhere, you mean we have text to talk about Him jerking off and eating it,
but we don't have text about Him farting, something is wrong, something is wrong, let out a holy squeaker, right, when there's no evidence of holy squeakers anywhere but the dude is arrested in a public park with a naked kid, what is going on, what is going on, the Olympics was dedicated to Dionysus, now wait a minute people,
let's just, can we just mention real quickly, people are like, oh, we shouldn't talk about this, this shouldn't, this shouldn't, yes, yes we should, good for the French, good for the French, people are pissed off because it implies the Dionysus is the real Christ, guess what, that's what our history says too, do you feel discomfort at that, do you know what's holding off Christian theological,
theocracy, right now, do you know what's holding it off, that free speech is holding it off, give us, give us the tyrants again, where's Talos, Talos get in here, give him, give him again, Talos.
And again, Christians get out and vote just this time, you won't have to do it anymore, four more years, you know what, it'll be fixed, it'll be fine, you won't have to vote anymore, my beautiful Christians, I love you Christians, I'm a Christian, I love you, get out, you gotta get out and vote, in four years you don't have to vote again, we'll have it fixed so good, you're not gonna have to vote.
Look at you, look at you evangelicals, look at you, you Catholics, look at you, do you know what, we don't have to apologize for saying Jesus stole, ripped off the bucket coat, we don't have to do that, the Jews did too, the Christians did too,
why they needed to build some kind of modest reality, and now you and I, you and I who aren't modest, this is coming for us, this is coming for us, this is your mirror, and it's only gonna get better, it's only gonna get better, watch, for the images now to come through, watch for Talos to become reddened in his eyes,
watch for him to ascend, do you know what's funny, you can't take away the power of the muse, you can't take away the power of the muse because she is the one writing the story, isn't that nice, isn't that nice, there's a track that Talos must take, and we're right there, we're right there to watch it happen, this is lovely and perhaps a few of us may participate,
participate, give me the next one, give me the next one, what is the person we're looking at for, this Hierophant, I just wanted to see him, next one, there's the Hierophant, look, people, what does he say, oh God, oh God, what's happening, hang on, no, I'm reading it, so I can't remember what's happening, yeah, oh, so what you do, this thing that Mark, he says this thing that Mark wrote, which has all of those keys in it that are gonna help us,
