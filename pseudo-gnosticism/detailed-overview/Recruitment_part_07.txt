so that we can perpetuate our sexual drug rights, those things are guarded, he says, very carefully in Alexandria, they're guarded there, right, and they're only revealed to those people alone who are Muo-ing, and you know what that is, you know what that is, what are they Muo-ing, they're Muo-ing the great mysteries, the great mysteries, see the first two words on the bottom line,
you mean Jesus Christ is involved in the great mysteries when he's caught in those tombs with those kids, okay, just bring him on, right here, you know what, bring here, I found tonight people, the kid, the naked kid that was with Jesus when he was arrested in the public part, here's what it says about him, are you ready, are you ready,
the demons, here's the problem with the world people, the demons, they're always out to get people, and they always send somebody along like carpocrates, the carpocratians, right, carpocrates, they always send somebody like that along, and what does he do, he learns those technical arts, and what did he do, he ended up buying somebody off, he ended up attracting someone who would, you know, facilitate the whole lay stick fair,
right, you can't have the boy without the banquet, right, and this is the banquet, so he gets the Presbyterian Alexandria to be, you know, helpful to supply the goodies, and what does he do, he gets a copy of this mystic mark,
yeah, he gets a copy of the mystic rites, the stuff that we don't want the public to see, we don't want them to see it so bad, we tell people who are initiated, what do we tell them, what's the phrase, is this it, no, this is the mystic gospel, that's what we're, that's what we're into people, right, we're at all right, and I'm about to show you what they do in the mystic gospel,
this is not what you Christians who tromp around today, this is not what you know, right, this is the inner core of what Jesus practiced, are you ready, give me the next one, remember, I'm translating, you don't, you don't have to tell people the truth all the time, you don't have to, it's okay,
sometimes it's okay to lie, sometimes when you're protecting people, it's okay to lie, it's okay, if he lies 24 hours a day, it's okay, give me the next one, give me the next one, what happens to the boy, are you ready now, everybody here's the climax, here's the climax, I'm going to talk a little bit after this but I want to bring you to the climax right now, are you ready,
Jesus Christ is here, here he is, he's right there, there he is, hi Jesus, and what is he doing, he, was that Jesus, you heard a great voice coming out of the town, and so you went up to the town, so what did you do, you rolled away this stone, right, from this one tomb, and you went inside it and there was this little kid, so, and he's laying there, like limp, and so you stretched out your hand Jesus, you picked, you revived him,
yeah, after you took him by the hand, you revived him, and when the neonese ghost opened his eyes and saw you, he fell in love with Jesus, and he begged you, he begged you please, please let me be with you, yeah, yeah, so what did Jesus do, well he and the kid went back to the house, the estate,
let's hang on, next one, they went back to this estate, boom, hey I just pulled your kid out of the tomb, right, I just pulled him out, and he's hot to trot for me, Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, what's going on, he goes to the kid's home, and of course the kid is wealthy, of course that's what it says, ain't got a blue seal, the dude is wealthy, the kid is wealthy,
so Jesus stays with him for six days, and you know what he does, he trains the kid, Jesus trains the kid, so that on the seventh day the kid comes out, listen people, this is it, this is the disgusting of disgusto, are you ready, it does not get deeper than this,
the kid comes out, comes to Jesus wearing nothing, but a scene done on his private parts, wait a minute, did we see this before, yeah we saw it, Mark, you remember the kid with the scene done on his private parts, the kid comes to Jesus with a bandage after Jesus trained him,
and what happens, they, I'm translating, they spent the night together, and Jesus taught that little boy the mystery of the kingdom of God,
love, it says the boy fell in love with Jesus on waking up, do you know what we become when we follow Jesus, we become his bride, we become his bride, do you know what Jesus wants,
he wants to spend the night with you, if you're a boy, and you're rich, otherwise he's gonna take you out of your family's houses, and out of your father's boats, he's gonna kidnap you,
and he's gonna perform those dirty dirty things that Christ's do, and when those Christ's get arrested, they claim that they are not traffickers, but they crucify him anyway, now the funny thing is,
the funny thing is, if Jesus Christ had gotten the thanosemone on board and hadn't gotten his galene from the child, what would happen, he would have entered death on the cross, but he could have been brought out of it too,
he could have been brought out, he could have been raised, everybody says, oh resurrection, resurrection, fertility, resurrection, resurrection, cool,
you know the actual science and anthropology are way more interesting, if you pull your head out of the fairy tale, let's go, let's go, sorry, that was a little bit, give me, it's the last one, right, so,
I just want you to see the very same language, this is Mark 1451, and there was a little kid, he followed after Jesus, and he wrapped a scene down around his private parts,
they went to seize him, right, cops tried to arrest him, and the kid ran off, and his bandage falls off, do you know what was happening with that bandage, do you see it now,
love drives the mystery that Jesus Christ is promoting, this mystery creates a monistic cage outside of which is death,
the people of the Olympics should not have apologized, there is no sacred state religion, there is none, there will be none,
as long as lady liberty and the republic are alive, is this political, no, this is your reality unfolding, thank you for allowing me to help you to see that,
I want to leave you with an image before I jump to another subject, which is just for those of us who want to be close or connected,
yeah, and by that I mean you being in a classroom where I can give you enough skill in the dojo and show you enough that you can be individually,
your own reader, your own translator, you don't need me to tell you about these orgies, these Christian practices,
you don't need me to tell you that Judaism and Christianity are built upon a child, an industry, an industry, a child industry,
you don't need me to tell you that, you don't need me to tell you that, you can look up those sources yourself, and that's what I want to show you,
thank you for coming to this section of Lady Babylon, I want to say thank you to Teddy for bringing us the most excellent music,
now I'm going to step out and I'm going to tell you, be a little more casual,
until everyone, what I've got going on is I'm going to start teaching three times a week, I'm going to teach a Monday class that is for people who've already been through the course,
