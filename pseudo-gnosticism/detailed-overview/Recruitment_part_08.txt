we will start week after this coming week, and it's for people who are going to read a text, and the text that I have chosen is Lucian's Ass,
I want everybody to read and just gobble up Lucian's Ass, it's a gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous text,
and we need to get that buzz from the text that we can say things like the burning purple, not the burnt purple,
it's the burning, the inflaming purple, right, it's the oyster's fantastic, I want to train people, the Monday is going to be the readers,
people, and I will invite you, you don't have to, I will invite you, now Tuesday and Thursday, what I'm going to do is I'm going to open my studio to nine people,
eight paid, and one not, that one will be there on scholarship, and what you will do is we will just push you through the dojo,
you get time, you know, when I can do you as a group, when I can fashion you as a group, I can do it a lot better than I can when you can't respond to me,
so now I'm a free agent, I just quit my job, I just quit my job, and what I'm doing is I'm opening up the Greek dojo for individuals,
now I have so many applications, I am narrowing down who I'm going to take for the first two classes,
it will be a Tuesday class and a totally separate Thursday class, the Tuesday class will be from seven to nine p.m., excuse me, not nine,
eight thirty, it's an hour and a half, you can't take people beyond an hour and a half without them wanting to jump out a window, you know,
it will be for those an hour and a half, seven to eight thirty p.m., Tuesday, and Thursday, I will pick out nine of you for Tuesday,
and I will pick out another nine for Thursday, my ultimate goal is to get everybody who expressed an interest,
okay, so if you don't get picked this time, think of it as lottery, and think of it as, I'm just trying to get this off the ground,
this is, we're just, you know, this is new stuff, right, and we're training here, a whole bunch of people, I just wrote to, I wrote to Carl Rock today,
and I said, hey, would you let me interview you, just as a classicist, just talk about Greek, and about the process of learning Greek,
and that kind of stuff that I think we could really benefit from when you see somebody who's seasoned in the art, and he's really pushing forward, right,
so there's been such tremendous interest that what I'm going to do is I will email you if you're selected, just like Willie Wonka,
if you get the golden ticket, I'm going to email you by tomorrow noon, and I hope that you can join me on Tuesday night, or on Thursday,
and I'll tell you which one you are, which group you are, if you can't make it, please tell me, I can't make it at that time, I can let somebody else have your slot,
I want to have complete slots before we go forward, and your applications are the basis on which I'm choosing people at this time,
but I got to be quite honest with you, there's a little bit of, there's a little bit of, you know, I don't know, throwing bones and that kind of thing, you know what I mean,
it's hard, it's hard when you get such outstanding response to people who want to take, I mean, we have over 100 people who want to take Greek,
this is crazy, right, so my ultimate goal is to get to everybody, right, is to get to everybody, but now I am going to make this my job,
this is officially this week becoming my job, we will have class Tuesday, we will have class Thursday, okay, Lady Babylon will continue pushing
almond universities in a course, so somebody can come back in six months, and they can say, you know what, I want to take that whole course,
and you just click, click, click through it, see the ending, see the little things that you have to be learning, boom.
Now, the people that are helping, the graduate students, a lot of you graduate students who are helping with the Saturday clinics, the Saturday labs that are in on Discord,
I know, I saw your last message, Nancy, and I know that everything is going swimmingly, people are working hard, and I want to, I want to tell everybody that's a great place to go,
it's a great place to go to get some outside help, right, to get, to, to, to motivate you a little bit more.
The program that we're starting is 20 weeks, that's all we have, 20 weeks to get through that intensive course, and it's all we need if we use our time wisely.
It'll be a pleasure for me to get to know you as individuals, as we're shaping up, as we're shaping up our Greek.
