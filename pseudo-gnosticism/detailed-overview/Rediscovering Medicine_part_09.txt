The Egyptians were dummies or anything.
It's a fact that the language that they use is hindering their capacity for abstract thinking.
And the Greek language encouraged it and just whipped the garbage out of every other language in the Mediterranean.
Marcus Aurelius, the Roman emperor, is writing in Greek.
He's writing in Greek.
He's taking his Greek theriac and he's writing in Greek and people are like, look, he looks so handsome.
Powerful.
Yeah.
He's a druggy.
He's a junky people and Galen's complaining about having given him more opium all the time.
Yes.
How about, can we go to modern day Limnos and try to recreate the medicine?
I'd say that would be worth a shot, Ion.
I would.
I'd say that, that would be, and you know, somebody, somebody is going to be intrepid and try to go all the way.
You know, you know, it'll probably be somebody who sees the positive benefit.
Right.
I mean, imagine this thing supposedly, you know, if we have the purple and we can supposedly treat tumors.
Wouldn't we want access at least to analyze this stuff and see what's going on?
I don't know.
It seems like a, seems like a no brainer.
I'll catch you guys.
I thought we'd go this summer, but no, it didn't work out.
Greed one.
Boo.
Let's go to the next one.
When did Galen live?
Second century.
Ono Domini during the reign of Marcus Aurelius and a little bit thereafter.
Yeah.
He was Commodus's physician too.
He kind of thought Commodus was a moron.
Yeah.
Love it.
Go to the next one.
Okay.
Give me one comment here.
Here.
How about, yeah.
Oh, look at that.
I know somebody.
Oh, phew.
I know someone who tried to suck the venom out of a snake bite of a child.
Are they a vampire?
My God, man.
Are they a vampire?
Yeah.
Speaking of vampires, that's a very Greek thing.
That's of it.
Right.
Dracon.
The order of the dragon is a great concept.
Right.
Dracon.
What is that?
Dracon.
Yeah.
That's that power.
That's that guardianship.
And the funny thing is when you are, listen, this is what I find is neat.
Maybe, is there a medical application?
I don't know.
But medically, it's interesting to think about.
When I am on that wave of the communion and I've had the drug, I've had the
attack and I've had with it the
the death inducer, that death state inducer.
When I've got those drugs on board, I get a thirst for blood and a taste for flesh.
I get a thirst for blood and a taste for flesh.
I've seen rites that use baby blood.
I've seen it.
They were Christian sex.
I was looking at early Christian sex and the stuff that they did.
There's a lot of stuff going on, man.
And you can never draw a line between what's the religion and what's the medicine.
Yeah.
Okay.
I think we'll call it Cerberus.
Get that off there.
Get that off there.
Satanic congregation, thank you for that.
Thank you for that.
Thank you for showing up to all of our friends in Australia who are looking at
modern medicine and its approaches as being insufficient.
I think those professional physicians in antiquity, those midwives,
all of those pharmacologists, I think they would say the same thing.
I think they would look at us and say, what a simplistic, stupid approach.
It's probably their language, set Anglo-Saxon garbage, probably.
Thank you very much for coming tonight.
Watch this video now.
It's nice mesmerizing.
Hit it, Chewie.
