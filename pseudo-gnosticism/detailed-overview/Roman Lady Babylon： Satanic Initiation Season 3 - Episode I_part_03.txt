Okay
Another source, let's do this
Yeah, so this is who Juno is seeking, right?
This eunim pelascom
She wants there to be some choice
And some loving and some helping and some desiring
Some breathing in and out
With this eunim pelascom
This youth, this young man
This Pulaski and Prince
That's why she needs the medwa
That's why she needs her
Next one, please
I just want you to see that the pirates are showing up
I want you to see the pirates coming to this
But when I say pirates, forgive me
Grandmaster Depp
But when the pirates show up
We're talking about child traffickers is what we're talking about
We're in a different place
So when Jesus is yelling about himself being a buccaneer
He's not talking about the swashbuckling type
That you might want to have dinner with
He's talking about the type that are stealing children
For the sake of the sex trade
Which is not funny
For the sake of Jesus in that context
It kind of gives you an icky feeling
We have to be honest
We cannot cover anything up
Give us another Roman source
Speak, dragon
Bacchus, right?
Bacchus, why?
You need to know that when you're dealing with Medea
You're dealing with the Bacchic Coat
Yes, yes
During her existence as she walked around
She was called Diana
Right? It wasn't her
Being named after the god
It was her
She was the source
She was the source of dianic worship
She has the right to kill the stranger
It's gorgeous, absolutely gorgeous
We're going to get into the death and stuff
I'm telling you, the drugs, don't worry
The drugs will ground us
That's our salvation
These drugs will ground us
Because they're going to show up here in the text
In a minute, you're going to be like
A lot of people tell me that all the time
They're like, I didn't think you actually meant
Or I didn't think that there was actually support for this
I didn't think that you were actually right
It's not about theories
It's not about writing books
And keeping your position
And establishing a huha-bruha
It's about those texts
And about our integrity
And the translation of those texts
That's really what matters here
So, let's go back
Let's keep jumping in
See if we can go a little bit deeper
Thanks for your patience tonight
Next quote
Yes, okay
On the second line
Cognosco
How do you like that? It sounds like
A little more Barry White in there, maybe
Cognosco
I recognize
secreta polorum
That's Medea talking
She understands
The secrets
Or the hidden things
Of the polls
Do you know who she is?
Do you know those poll lords?
See Morbus at it
If there will be
Disease
If war
Is undertaken
If it rains
If it floods everything out
Or
If the sky
Is
Blazoned
With the horns
Of the
Red flames
Korusket in Latin is a great
Verb, it actually does
It's the image of horns
Driving through something
Love that
And look at the last
I mean this is the
Most hilarious thing I've seen
This bottom line here
So she's addressing
That first
You could say
Rapist
And not be wrong
Because he's a dude
On a boat
Who sails in a town
Abducts a woman
Anyway
Right
So look at what
Look at what the medwah has to do
Right
And he's just the first
He's just the first
The dude comes in
And he takes for the sake of sexual
Purposes
Yeah
He abducts
For the nymphizing
Of the virgin
Yeah
Yeah
Now it happened to be
And we're going to get into that with the dragons
That
Remember that Medea is
Involved at a very high level
Of
Late Bronze Age society
She's a queen
And eventually she ends up
With what
You could call as the
Origins of the
Opersian power
Yeah
Yeah, as a matter of fact we call
Meads
