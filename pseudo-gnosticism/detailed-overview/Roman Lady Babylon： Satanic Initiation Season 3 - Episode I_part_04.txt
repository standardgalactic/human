Because of her name
Yeah
Medea
The medewa
The dewana
Or the diwana
Yeah, nice
It's gorgeous. A lot more of it's coming
Through the Latin than you think
Everybody's been emphasizing
For the first two seasons
I've been giving you all Greek sources
Well
As any philologist and this is what separates
When you're out there shopping around
And somebody's telling you
This is the mysteries
Blah blah blah
Ask and they say Greek
Blah blah blah
You can test them
If they can't do
Ancient Latin sources
Good ancient Latin sources
Then
Don't believe me because their Greek wasn't
Gained through
The avenue of classical philology
Yeah
And every classical philologist
Takes for granted
That these two
Cultures
Produced languages
That interacted with each other
And
The real goodies
The real goodies
What's the difference between the
Greek, Coase
And
Somebody
From the Latin tradition
What's the difference
This kind of thing is important
More text
Somebody bring the text
Chewie, another text please
I just want you to see that
Magam, look at that last word
Right, that's her. She is a maga
She is a maga
So she is a queen
Right
She is royalty
And
We're building temples to her
We're building temples to her
On our side of the fence
On the western side of the fence
We call her
Isn't that nice
We're going to see that in a second
It means serpent
It means serpent
Yeah, gorgeous
Love it, Lady Babylon
Go ahead, another source
Oh, look at this
Here's our anquez
Here's our anquez
What are these serpents
What do they do
They webrant
They
Bring about
Vocally
Sibila
Violations, whisperings
Sub-weperes
Dintibus
Under their
Viper teeth
Under their viper teeth
These anguest
You know, a lot of Greeks
Bring it back up, because now I'm going to
Look, this is inevitable
You're going to get this
There's conflicts in antiquity, right
Linguistically, there's conflicts
And people will argue
There's a Greek word, Greek origin
And the other stuff, Romans would be like
No, no, no, this is a Latin word
Latin origin here
Most of the time, you can tell pretty easily
But sometimes they fight over the concepts
And
That's what you're going to see here
But bring up that text again
Same one, please
Dude
Dude
There we go, so that last word
Sorry, the last word
For your serpents
So, Angithia
We have a temple to her
And we know from our ancient
Authorities that that's what they called
Medea
In Italy
And there's temples to her
Anyway, look at the first word
Sibila
Yeah, you want to say
Are
Sibilations the same thing
The Sibil gives off
They say, no, no, it's not
It's Sibil is from
C plus
Bule
C plus Bule, the Greek Bule
Which means council and C
Is the Tyranian
Or Etruscan
For those gods
Thank you, John
So
Is there an Etruscan connection there
With Sibule
Perhaps
These whisperings
These Sibilations
Are
Associated with
Oracular cult
The Sibil
Who is that serpent
I mean, they're calling her for Frick's sake
Pythia
Medea
Is the one that started this
If you don't believe me
Ask Pindar
Who provides her
In a fourth Pythian ode
