Of Medea's
Mystery
Yes, Moses, isn't that neat?
Jesus came later
Another corruption
Of the right
And for those of you
Who need it more directly
Judaism and Christianity
Are both the offspring
Of pagan mystery
A thousand years before
Either of them had anybody
On the scene in diapers
Yes, this is wonderful
Let's go, another one
Yes, she has a chariot
Right, she has a chariot
And
These dragons
Right?
They offer up to her
They give her their necks
Yes, these dragons
Who carry her song
It was dragons that showed up
The night that she burned
Let's turn the
We're going to
We only have like two quotes left
So we'll get to those, but I want you to know
The night, I'm going along, I'm sorry
The night that she burned
Right, so get this in your head
She is a queen
In
Exile
And
She is
She
One night, she burns
The princess
And
Her father to death in a wedding
That was with the
Yasun Premis
First
First Jason, and for those of you
Haven't made a connection yet
To Jesus, it's the same name
It's not Hebrew
It's the same
Name
In Greek
Yasun is a title
Within mystery cult
Just like
Christos
Yeah, that's
Interesting, so this guy
He got arrested in a public park
Called Gethsemane
At 4am with a naked boy
And was calling himself
A child trafficker
He was using a title
Within a mystery cult
That had to do with the transmission
Within the blood
Of the new life
Yeah
Yeah, the mystery is not a question
It's an operation
It's a performance
Yeah
And we know
That's why that naked kid was with him
There were snakes and stuff
Bring up the snakes
Let's get to this last
For those of you who doubt
That our snakes are so important here
Even after we dredged up old Moses
And forced him
To lift up his staff
With his snake on it
And this thing into a snake
You know what I mean?
Gorgeous
Even after that, if you don't believe me
I'm telling you
They're working on this medically
With dotes and antidotes
And let's look at some
Why the snakes? Why the snakes?
People are going to, you watch
Within a period of time
People will catch on to this
In classics and history
And they'll say, what about the
Dogs? Right?
It's just the way I started spouting this
Years ago
Trying to get people's attention
But nobody reads these tags
Drakontius
Who reads Drakontius?
Nobody, like bring him back up
Come here, buddy
Get up here
Bring him
Another Drakontius
Yeah
Medicamina serpens
Weeper a seipe
You what?
Weeper a seipe
You hear a little bit of the
This is a couplet, right?
Elegiac couplet
It's got a line of hexameter
And a line of pentameter
It loses a foot
Somewhere in the middle
Anyway, you can hear a little bit
Of it there
Well, no rhymes
Because we don't rhyme
It's more sophisticated
It's meter
Anyway
Let's translate this
Right?
So your ass can kill you
Right?
But your snakes also are
Medicines, right?
They also have medicines, this says
Your vipers
Often time help
And often time
They kill
They kill
Look at this
Here is the
Oh, yeah, I can feel that glow
Can you feel that glow?
It's like around his midsection
It's like a bottom glow
