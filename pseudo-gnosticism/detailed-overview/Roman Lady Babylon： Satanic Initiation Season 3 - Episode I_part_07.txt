We'll call it
Yes, right?
No offense, Mithras
Sorry about that
Yeah, no, I forgot where I was
Look what happened
I'm lost
Here we are, the vipers can help
And they can kill
Right? So this whole idea
Of this balance between
The dote and the antidote
Don't think that it's not there
It's the central heart
Of the mystery
Is there one more? Give me one more
Quote here, I'm sorry
This is going to wrap it all
I'll try to talk again, kind of more
Mysteriously
Isn't that nice?
Concula
Yeah, that shell
That little creature
Brings us the delights
And the death
From that
Deep, deep wave
Yeah, she brings forth
The
True riches
Of the burning purple
Palagi
In that second line of the couplet
Palagi
Is a word that you can use
To represent the sea
Or specifically
The sea mollusk
That gives us the purple
That is our
Phoenix
Our Phoenician power
Yes, you should see it
And that's why that Phoenician princess
What is her name?
She's royalty
She's the priestess of a start
Right?
I think you call her Jezebel
Jezebel
Love it
Love it
Lady Babylon, what does she have
On her forehead?
She has one name
She of a thousand names
Has one name
Mystery
Her
Historically, she started it
It was only
It was only accessible
Through her
Is that
Is that our final
That's our final quote, right? Good
I also, there's a lot
From Dracontius
Over the next
Six
Weeks
We're going to
Focus on the Roman side
We're going to focus
On
This being the first week
For the next six times
That we meet, we're going to focus on that
Burning purple
And upon finding it
And looking at
The right
As the exercise
Generating the oracle
So Lady Babylon
Can
Be made
Visible
That's what they call it
Making the invisible visible
Yes, it's
Gorgeous
And I will be bringing out
Little bits of Dracontius here and there
That are at the point that I think
That would be most appropriate
But I do have a game plan
For this third season
And
We will be jumping
Into some rich, rich
Waters that you're not going to get
If you want to sit around and listen to people's theories
Right? We don't need
Theories, right?
We don't need to sell books, we're not selling books
Brother, right?
I think what I'm going to do
Is invite
Quick here for the last
10 minutes to invite
Snappy and
Rob, do we have Rob here as well?
Why don't we
Start with Snappy and Snappy
Tell me
Your reflections
Tonight on what
Dracontius
I'm completely blown away
It's absolutely
Amazing
It connects all the dots
And it shows that this tradition has survived
Well into the Roman times
It's everything you've been talking about
I'm still
Processing, I need some time
Awesome, awesome
Rob, what's your
By the way, Snappy
You're going to have to defend your title
Because you and Thonius are kind of co-champs
Next Friday
We'll have a fight night
A fight club
And I'm looking forward to it
So we're going to do it
Anyway, next Friday
Rob, what's your impression?
Any impression
Or thoughts
On Dracontius?
Why are you kidding?
Are you kidding me?
Yeah, I feel sick
That was a big meal
A lot of courses that was
