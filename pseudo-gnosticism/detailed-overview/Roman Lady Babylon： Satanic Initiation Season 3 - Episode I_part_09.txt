Which is great, because I get to spank
Everywhere
I love it
But tell the group
What that means to you
It's something to come back
In the middle of your life
Totally new like this
But you see that there's a reason for it
Tell us
What motivates you
It's
It's compiled
Every day
Each and every day
By
This morning
I woke up and I've come down
And I've made sure I can remember
All the declensions for the nouns
And I want to write it all out
But where that comes from
Is
It's just
A fascination
Where I'm coming from
And
Going into something
Through you that is
It's just compiling
Fascinating and drives
Each and every day at the minute
And
It's only increasing because
You're saying now
Latin is going to come
To the front and
Keeping up with everything
Is hard work
It's hard work but
I can't come away from it
There's no coming away from it
That episode is just
So many
Ends up for
I knew it would be good
I knew that episode would be good
I hope people go back and watch it
Because there's so much in it
And draw out what
Is in it because
It's pretty damn
Conclusive
The path of the arc
You've just took it on
Has taken us to
And it covers all the research I've been doing
For the past two years
And
It's coming from a Latin
A Latin source
And he's giving you the diagram
Which is the indication
He's showing you where this is
Originating through the language
And that to me is
Is magic
Well we've got to get
Sweaty and in the pit
With the
With the Romans
We've got to get naked in the pit
With those Mithraic
Officers
In there
I love this
And there is
So much that I want to
Share with you
That
Is
That allows us to build that scene
Better so that we can just see
What's the frickin' reality
We're not here to start cults
Somebody was asking me
About
What kind of people
Are you doing
Do you want participating
I want all kinds of people
I don't care what you are
You know
I don't care what your
Religion is
I don't care what group you're in
I don't care where you go hang out
Where jackets
I don't care about that stuff
None of that stuff is important
In here we preserve the integrity
Of the muse
And we work with those texts
If that can help you
To break into the reality
That look Jesus Christ
Was a dude who got arrested
By the legitimate authorities
In a public park with a naked
Kid
Calling himself a sex
Pirate
Okay
What happened in that picture
There's a reason to this
It's not the fairy tale
That's what I want
And I'll end with this
Asking snappy
Are we breaking through
To the reality
Is this productive
Or
I'm giving you the last word
Yeah
It's beyond productive
I don't understand how people
Can't see these things
We have these titles
We have these positions
We miss it now
When we see what Yasin is doing
Right
And then you look at all of these other characters
It's almost like laid bare
And why this is so important
Is because there's been a cover up
There's been an orchestrated effort
To remove this kind of magical connotation
And to whitewash and sanitize
Jesus
And everything he's about
No, we can't allow that
You know
I could not say that
Better
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
Hail Satan
