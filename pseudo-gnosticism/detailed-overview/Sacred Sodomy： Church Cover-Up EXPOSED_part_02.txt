Contemporary Roman Christians knew of this ritual as applying, quote,
the fires of temptation. It was a devastatingly difficult indoctrination meant to rescue the
damned. It even required that a priest be on hand after its completion to fully debrief and counsel
the shell-shocked initiates. The severity of Christian initiation disturbed the Romans but
in the eyes of the church hierarchy desperate spiritual times called for desperate spiritual
measures. Ritual exorcism is not difficult to comprehend. Its theology is as elegant as its
rationale is unquestionable. In the mind of the Christian priest, the world is full of demons
and these demons have a peculiar affinity for naive, spiritually pure, pre-puberty boys.
Tertullian wrote in Apologeticus about the belief that Christians possessed a fiery breath
that was able to send demons out of the bodies of the possessed. He says that demons flee to the
touch of Christians or their breath. This fits the historical context well when we consider that
Cyril of Jerusalem, one of the greatest advocates of ritual sodomy, wrote in the Procatechesis and
Mystagogical Catechesis about the process of breathing or blowing upon young, nude, oiled boys.
Be earnest, he says, in submitting to the exorcisms. If you are blown upon and exorcised,
the process brings you to salvation.
