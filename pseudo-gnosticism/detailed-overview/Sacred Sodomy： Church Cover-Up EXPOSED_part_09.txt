suffering. This must be the reason that priests took such drastic measures to save the youth of
the world. The pains of the fires of sexual temptation were far less horrific than an eternity
in the underworld. Whether or not modern Catholic priests are following the tradition of institutional
rape created by the earliest Christian clergy has so far eluded the public. Even a cursory
look at the earliest writings of the Christians reveals that ritual rape was an institutional
standard used in processing initiates. It is not unreasonable to assume that the theological
justification for sodomizing young boys is still present in the ranks of Catholic priests.
The rape of children in the modern Christian church may not be as organized as it was when
the church first developed, but child abuse clearly remains an institutional problem.
For reasons that continue to elude investigators, the church actively fosters and protects the
practice of child molestation and sexual assault. Priests have sexually abused children for centuries
and bishops have always protected these rapists from prosecution. The Catholic Church has remained
very much the same for 2,000 years. The problem of child rape may never be rooted out of the church
because it is integral to the very foundations of Christianity.
