I never meant anything I said Just spittin' up everything I've been fittin'
Keepin' from eatin' away at me Never said anything I meant
I never said the letters that I should've said But so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
But when I say, never meant nobody knows When I say, never was a cost for a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Welcome back to Lady Babylon! This is the season 3 finale
And we're gonna have a Bible study tonight
I'm going to bring you two passages
These two passages will be about Scythian women and their most potent drug
I want to bring you two passages tonight
And the first one that we're gonna look at is from Hippocrates
The second is from a guy named Gaius Valerius Flakus
Which you are a little bit familiar with by now because we've used him a couple of times
But we want to show everyone, we want to tell the kiddies and we want to show everyone the right
Everybody's looking for the right, they want to know the right
So tonight we're at a place where we're going to again set that ship for that late Bronze Age right
Mystery, religion right, and we're gonna step out of that ship
We're gonna try to see through a couple of these ancient authors
We're gonna see what's actually going on
Tonight's theme is a woman that we have yet to see
I've got a little subliminal messaging here packaged that we need to show you first
As usual, just to kind of warm up, to get our juices flowing, chewy, light speed
Music
Music
Music
Music
So we start tonight at a place that's a little bit behind where the historians like to start
They like to start in the Iron Age for some reason
They think the city is just, I don't know, maybe they were deposited here by someone
They're part of these tribes that are moving and mobile populations
And they've got branches throughout different parts of the Mediterranean, Asia Minor, and the Ionian coast
Yes, oh god, we're gonna love this stuff
These are beautiful, let's go to them right away
Let's run to our first source, our first source tonight
And by the way, for those of you who are following with the right, just keep your hands in the car at all times
Let's do this, bring up Hippocrates
I summon Hippocrates
Yes, come here you old fool
This is from the Hippocratic Corpus
I've been working with my students with this text this week, my Greek students
Because it is Ionian Greek
It is Ionian Greek and it's good for them to get exposed to something that's not quite attic
You know what I mean, get some of that good Homeric
You can't be talking about dialects with me unless you've been there
You know what I mean, I love it
This is Ionian, this is the scientific Greek
This is what all the Hippocratic stuff is in
You love it, you're gonna get these Ionian philosophers along the coast
There was modern-day Turkey, right?
Oh, can you smell it? I love this stuff
Okay, throw up that Greek there, let's look at this little bit
There was this Scythian group, the Scythian clan
Yeah, in Europe, right?
Which lives Oike, listen to the attic is Oike
The Ionian is Oike
Isn't that nice? It's a nice little dialectical difference
They're around Lake Miotis, which is the Sea of Azov, right?
Excellent, excellent, we showed that
Subliminally, you should have it programmed
We got there to that place, we found it, we landed
Thanks, Chewie, you can land now, that's fantastic
Alright, and these people were different, says Hippocrates
Or the Hippocratic Corpus, whoever it was that wrote this
They differed from the other nations, they're called Sauromacians
The Sauromatai, the Sauromatai they're called
And the women of these people, again a little bit of Ionian Greek here
Not the Attic Tuton, but the Ionian Tutteon
You like that? They throw in a little extra, a little extra vow
Then get assimilated of that, of these people
What do the women do? He says the Hippodzontai, they ride horses
And they talk Seusi, talk Seusi
They shoot arrows, poison arrows, okay
And they akuntidzu sin, they throw javelins from horseback
Apotoniipon, as they're riding
Wow, these are some tough people
Kaimachontai, and they fight with the soldiers
They fight in wars, they fight in wars
Isn't that neat?
And then we get the line that throws us all the curveball, okay
Don't take your, take your medicine, right
Take your nausea pills, guys, right
My regulars will know this, right
Take your nausea pills
Heos an parthenoi eosin
Until they become parthenic
Until they become a parthenos
Wait, wait, wait, that's the age of able to produce children
So, but not having had any children yet
That's what a parthenos is, right
You can also call her a heifer, right
Yeah, wow, this is fantastic
Wait a minute, these girls were in the cavalry
And using toxic bows, using the, riding the horses
Yeah, apparently they were so darn good
They could, they could kick anybody's butt
