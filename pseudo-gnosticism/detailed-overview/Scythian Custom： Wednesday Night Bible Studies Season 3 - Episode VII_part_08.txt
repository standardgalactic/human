What does she do?
She harvests
To feed those
Old stuff
Oh my
God, she harvests the fetus
Oh
This is
Seriously? Yeah, no, this stuff
They're doing is quite
It's again considered a sacrifice
It's considered a sacrifice
And where are you doing this all?
You're doing this in the place
This one's going to throw you
Even the classes you're going to get thrown
Where is she doing all of this?
Yeah
Where is all this practice?
This mystery? Where is it coming from?
It's coming from that weirdess
It's coming from that essence
That is so strong within her
And what is the Roman name
For that essence? Juno
Juno
She now do you understand
Who the wife
Of God is
The wife of God
Yes, Juno
God
Yes, she is that power
Right?
And you suddenly say to yourself
Oh my God, these are all women
We have a trinity of women
That we're working for
Venus, the morning star
Artemis, excuse me
Venus, the morning star
The virgin and Juno
Wait, aren't these the three?
Wait a minute, these are the three

The apple
Heracles
Daughters
Poisons
The mystery

Flakas continues on
To talk about how he stretches out and rigor
He has his
Moment of release
His pain
It's described as unmitigated pain
As she sits over him
And she bedoos the earth
She bedoos the earth
And that's literally what it says
It says she makes do
D-E-W
D-E-W

From that cool
That holy thing
That sits in the poculum
In the sacred cup
That golden cup
She produces the foam
Afrodite
She comes
From the foam
Yeah, are you seeing it?
That's why I told you we had to go to the ocean, right?
And in the very next lines
Venus
Arrives
To both power her speech
In her hand
Her speech in her hand
Yeah, which if you knew the magic
You'd know, oh, okay, this area and that area
Yeah
This is gorgeous, people

We have so much of these rights preserved
If classicists would
Get up and start
Doing their jobs
