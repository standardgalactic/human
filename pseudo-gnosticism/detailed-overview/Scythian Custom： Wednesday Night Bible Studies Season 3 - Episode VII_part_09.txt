Right, with these tags
Come on, people
Right, come on, take it back
Take back the territory, right
Keep the museum open
Boo to Princeton for cutting
Off its own head, philologically
No more Greek, they say
Boo on you, Princeton
Princeton, I'm sure you have
Plenty of ideas
And plenty of notions
Plenty of theories, and you know what they're worth?
Zilch
Give me some tags
Yeah
Let's roast them
Let's get those people from Princeton
Chewie and let's build that
Barbecue that we found in the Codex
You know what I mean?
A metaphorical barbecue
Let's barbecue them
I got a Princeton guy right now
Metaphorically on a barbecue
And I'm gonna do to him
We'll call him Joe Princeton
Oh, god, I'm just gonna start to like this
This is the season finale, right
For season three, season four
We're gonna bring you some upgrades
Gotta give you some upgrades
And
I'm going to construct
A torture chamber
I didn't want to give that away early
But it's somewhere that we
Can pack young, and now
We're gonna have Joe Princeton
Come here, yes, I'm gonna introduce
I already want to call him up
I want to call him up, you know what I mean?
He has the soul of some
Dead sophist
You know what?
It's disgusting
It's disgusting
The furies, Joe, the furies say
Your greed stains your soul
With the stench of ruin
Long time before
Long time before that was ever
You know
Popularized
We're talking old
We're talking old Joe Princeton
I'm gonna give you a theriac
And I'm gonna administer
Where they administered theriacs
I am, and I'm gonna
Show the world, Joe, what you caused us to miss
We need to see this, guys
I wanted you to see
The strongest drug
Was the one that she made herself
Yeah, I look forward to next season
I look forward to seeing everybody
I'm going to
Officially go on a week's vacation
Where I will
Have one week
To enter in
To cross the spacetime
Continuum
To be able to enter into a place
Associated with the dead
This will be my one week nequion
So it's starting now
It's starting now
I will see you guys back
Friday after this one
For one week, right
We're just doing one week, right
Sorry, chewy plans, I just do
Okay, I'll see you guys
And I promise to bring you back
Fresh, fresh material
Right out of the jaws of those
Demons, right, right out of those
Right crawling right up out of the creek
Oh, I just love it
Hail Satan
