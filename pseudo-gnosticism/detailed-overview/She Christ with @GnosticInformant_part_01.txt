It's like you took something beautiful,
something somebody produced from,
who had been in an art school
and had worked under the great masters of art.
You know, like Michelangelo's student,
it's like you took that and you took that working.
You gave it to a seven-year-old.
And you were like, look, can you describe what you see here?
Because that's what you have in the classical Hebrew.
Because there's no Hebrew around.
There's no Hebrew around.
You're going to be shocked tonight by what this new scholar says.
He's not new.
He's new to me.
What this scholar says about that.
Yes, you're going to be shocked.
Okay.
He's there in the background too, Neil.
Hello.
I'm not going to take up a whole lot more time,
but we're going to go somewhere substantial here.
So I want you to see this.
Give me the next one.
Now, here's the Browning translation.
Yeah.
And here and there, heaven high, the torch uplifts,
flame medicated with persuasions mild,
with foul admixture unbeguiled of holy ungwent
from the clawed chrism brought from the palace,
safe in its abysm.
By the way, Robert Browning made up that word, right?
Which is something, yeah, he did.
Chewie's looking at me like, are you kidding?
No, he had to find somebody to rhyme chrism, right?
So he just made it up.
It's nice.
Look what, you know what happens?
This happens to my students too.
And we're going to talk about school in a minute,
but this happens to my students too.
They start corning words, right?
Emancipation, bro.
Classicist coin, those kind of words, right?
People who have those classical roots,
their minds get possessed by mother Greek.
And I'm not talking modern Greek,
because modern Greek is the result,
is the offspring of the church forcing itself on mother Greek.
And what happens, you get modern Greek, right?
So it's not the same.
I know that, I know that.
1.7 million.
Nobody, nobody, modern Greek is probably 60,000, 70,000.
There's no way.
Oh God, don't be surprised.
Don't be surprised if in the future,
cultures and people are studied by their language,
because it turns out their behavior comes from it.
Isn't that neat?
That's the power, right?
When they sat around and looked at each other,
racking, telling each other, racking, racking, racking.
And what is the racking?
Logos, you...
Let's do it, let's feed.
Okay, people, I've got some good stuff here
and I want you to enjoy it.
I've worked hard on this, hit me.
Here's another one.
Now, this other translation is by the guy
who wrote the grammar.
Herbert Smythe, genius, great guy.
Now here, now there, the flames rise high as heaven,
yielding to the soft and guileless persuasion
of holy ointment, the sacrificial oil itself brought
from the inner chambers of the palace.
Whatever you can reveal.
Whatever you can reveal.
She had a dream, Clyde and Mestra had a dream.
Can I tell you about it?
She dreamed, she suckled a snake
and the snake bit her breast
and the blood from the bite mixed with venom
contaminated the milk
and made the death inducer.
Oh God, what?
Ladies of the late Bronze Age,
what are you people doing?
What are you doing?
They're entering death
and when Jesus Christ stands up
and says to you,
you've been Christed in your eyes,
I'm going to give you a death inducer
but don't worry, it won't hurt you.
When Jesus Christ was doing that
and that's all from the gospels,
when he was doing that,
the cult had a very, very deep root in the civilization.
What he was doing was just tailoring it
to his own profiteering,
whatever he was gaining out of having the boys
in his service, the apostles.
So I'm going to Christ everyone, are you ready?
We've been talking about Christing for a while
and I'm doing this on purpose
because people on the outside
who were not part of the satanic congregation
the thing they're most interested in is Christing
and I think that's very important
for people to understand what Christing is
and I know you guys have seen a lot of Christing,
I got new Christing for you.
I said, don't sit there thinking that I'm going to feed you
the same routine and the lights are going to go off
at a specific time
and then there's step that you do here and there
until we're asleep.
That's not what's going to happen.
I'm going to give you new and exciting Christing.
New and exciting Christing.
This is lovely.
Okay, let's give me the next one, please.
Alright, what do we have here people?
I put together some elements.
I want you to think of this word
in Ergea
and I want you to think of it, not as energy.
Not as energy.
I want you to think about it as what it says
in the first paragraph at the end of it.
It says the activity and it says of drugs.
The gospel is the power of the drug compound.
It is what it is supposed to do.
What is the purpose of the drug?
The purpose is to bring
salvation.
Part of that is the energy.
On the medical side, the energy,
it is that activity of the drug.
I want you to be looking for the activity of the Christ.
I want you to be looking at the activity of that drug.
Okay, here we go.
Give me the next one.
There we go.
The next thing I want you to think about is
this is leading to ekporneo.
What am I going to do when I ekporinate?
I'm going to commit fornication.
Oh, God, no.
Here they go again.
Fornication.
Is anybody know what fornication is?
Fornication. Why don't you go fornicate?
Sounds bad, right?
What do you mean it's idolatry?
For those of you who haven't been here for long,
the act of sexual intercourse
is a form of religious worship.
I'm going to say that again.
The act of intercourse
is a sacred act,
a religious performance
whereby you should gain awareness.
Complete and total awareness.
That's why we call them the orgies.
So that's the place that we're looking for.
That's the place that we're trying to take the society.
That's why we have, again,
the priestesses and the bonkins.
That's why we have them purify us.
Do you see how the power
of the religion and antiquity
in a polytheistic system
is to bring the citizenry
to the best, most beautiful place?
It's very democratic.
Very democratic.
You want the best for your society.
You want the best for them.
You don't want to build a modest box
and whoever isn't the modest box gets wiped out.
That happens throughout history
over and over and over again.
By the way,
the devil was a little bit angry with me
for failing to mention something.
It's not going to give me any big trouble,
but perhaps it would be a better form
for me to acknowledge what he was saying.
He said, remind them, remember,
that the tyrant must always
dismantle and reestablish security.
The tyrant will always dismantle
and reestablish security.
That's security for the tyrant.
That's not security for you and me.
That's security for the tyrant.
I was like, all right, devil,
you're the one who did it and said it.
Let's go for it.
Okay, there you go.
Take that for what it is.
I don't care.
I don't care what you think.
Please, at least say something about it
in the comments.
By the way, your comments are fantastic.
The ones that are not fantastic are fantastic too.
There's some kind of thrill.
I get some kind of weird thrill
out of people who say negative things.
I don't know what it is.
I don't know what it is.
Fantastic, let's keep going.
Does it have anything to do with the anomos?
Where are we going back on our trail?
We're going back to the person who is anomos.
Are you anomos?
I want to show you what the Amazonian queens,
what the Scythian archers,
I want to show you what those women think.
You are anomos.
Give me the next one.
You are anomos.
You are athios anomos and adicos.
Do you know what you are?
You are a monist.
You are someone who despises justice.
You are someone without law.
Why did I say monist?
Why did I say monist?
Because monist is the person who denies the gods.
You see, you thought as a monist,
or as a Christian, as a Jew,
a religious Jew, or a religious Muslim,
as that person worshiping that one god,
you thought you were just like,
you clipped all the other ones off.
No.
No, no, no.
What you did by rejecting everyone,
but the one is create a world that was upside down,
in which you can't have justice anymore.
You can't have justice, right?
Oh god, it's the Bacchic conundrum.
Because this is the person we're here to cleanse.
We are here to cleanse those who the ancients called atheists,
namely the Christians, the monists.
We're here.
We're here to free those people.
And the only way to free them is to show them the gods.
Is to show them.
Yeah, bring back the history.
Why they guard these texts so well.
They're powerful.
You think, oh, the biggest, the most powerful substance
in the universe is that nuclear stuff we're messing around with.
Yeah, that's probably will be our demise,
but do you realize the power historically of those classical texts?
I'm proud of all the people who want to be in the classes.
I'm proud of that.
That's gorgeous.
It says a great thing.
It says a great thing about you, right?
Sit back as I'm reading all your applications.
Sit back and look at it and see.
You know what?
This is a good thing.
Look what I'm doing.
I love it.
I love it.
I commend everyone.
Everyone who sent in an application, I commend them.
Give me the next one.
We've got to hear Neil is saying.
He said, don't hurry, but I've got to get there.
We've got to Christ to everyone.
Watch this.
What else do I want you to see?
Here, people, step into those shoes.
We're looking at law.
That is the nomen here.
You see it in the blue, in the Greek.
Φαρμακον.
Μαλακοχερα.
Νομον.
What is that?
The soft-handed law of drugs.
That's how you refer to the physician's art.
Yeah, the soft-handed law of drugs.
Now, that soft-handed, I'd argue, you could push that to
the mollifying law of drugs.
The pain-killing law of drugs that's got that spirit of
hypocritees wrapped up in it and all that.
It's the gorgeous stuff.
This is all classical, right?
This is not Christian at all.
It's not any monism.
There's no monism involved here in the formation of classical civilization.
That's one thing I need to get across.
People are sitting here in a democracy.
At least the Americans, right?
That's at least what we believe.
We're sitting in a democracy.
We have to defend what that democracy is, and that democracy didn't come from Christianity.
It didn't.
That's what they're going to be teaching in the schools here.
Yes, our friends across the pond.
It's coming for you next.
What do we have to do?
We have to bring it back to them.
We have to show them democracy was not birthed by Christianity.
Democracy came from polytheistic people of all sorts of races.
All sorts.
The thing they had in common was their language and the fact that they were polytheists.
Who wouldn't walk through town and see the Temple of Justice and say,
That's a good thing, right?
When you walk by your city, your town hall, your city mayor's office at the police station,
you say, What a good thing, right?
Now, their police may be different from the city and archers, right?
Most of the time, you can nick somebody and knock them out, you know what I mean?
They ought to start giving the police some kind of chemical force.
That's fantastic.
No, don't take my suggestions.
What are you doing?
Look at me, Julie.
Can you believe anybody would listen to that?
What is the next source?
People, what's in the world today?
