They're pseudo-Christ and a lot of pseudo-profits.
And they're making signs.
They're doing signs, creating signs and these monstrosities.
And they're all to lead people astray.
They're all to lead people astray.
This is in the same Gospel where Jesus, in the next chapter, gets arrested in the public park
with a naked kid.
The time contemporary with Jesus Christ are pseudo-Christ and pseudo-profits.
Why do pseudo-Christ and pseudo-profits go together?
Because when you get really, really high, that's when you can hear the angels.
That's when you can hear the angels, bro.
You haven't been there?
Sorry.
Sorry for you.
Sorry.
But if you're a follower of Christ, you're going to have to go there.
Or else the Kingdom of Heaven has nothing to do with you.
And by the way, all our boys get castrated.
What?
What?
Oh God, we're back with the Syrian mother again.
I don't think she's going to tolerate this much longer.
Do you people just wait?
The Syrian mother is going to show up and all that stuff.
She's going to be chasing it out.
The watchers told me that.
They don't just watch, they can also talk.
Give me the next one.
And what happens now?
Yeah, in these days, after the tribulation, people would translate this as,
it's going to become dark and the moon will not give off its reflective light.
It's fangus, right?
That gorgiosity that permeates.
And so remember all of the worshipers of Selenia and that should be capitalized there, right?
Selenia and the New Testament is full of gods.
Yeah, it's got Hades and death and everything and they're active participants all the time, right?
Because it's written within a polytheistic culture that it then turned around children and destroyed in order to set up tyranny.
Complete and total tyranny.
Yeah, you bet man.
They had power not just over your things and over your body.
They had power over your soul.
They had power over your soul, baby.
You want that big house of yours?
They're going to get it.
They're going to get it and they did.
They did.
Are you ready for the dark ages again?
Who here?
No, seriously.
People in the chat, shall we see if you can put up chat?
Who here is for the return of the dark ages?
I can't wait for 1200, right?
When we get back to the stench of 1200, I'm going to throw them up there.
What's the name of it?
Hands off me, right?
Whose hands are the hands of Christ, right?
Oh, God.
All right, let's go.
Go to the source.
We'll come back to you.
We'll pick that up.
Here we are.
And yeah, what else is going to happen?
There's going to be stars that fall from Uranus, right?
The powers in the Uranus, in the heavens.
Yeah, they will shake.
They will shake, right?
It's a quantum event that includes drawing down the stars.
The applied amestra is drawing down the stars.
She is that woman.
Do you want to know what's under her feet, the moon?
Do you want to know what she clothes herself with, the sun?
Oh, my God.
This is gorgeous now.
No dark ages.
It's okay.
It's okay.
I like knowledge.
I like knowledge, too.
Yes, absolutely, Angela.
Absolutely, absolutely.
Right?
We don't want to go back.
No.
Right?
Oh, God, we've got it.
It's going to happen.
It's going to happen, people.
Right?
Right?
It's happening right around you.
Get your Bibles, Oklahomans.
I can't wait.
I can't wait.
Yeah, I should go teach in Oklahoma, shouldn't I?
If you think I should teach in Oklahoma, shouldn't I?
Oklahoma needs you, almond.
All right, let me get back to that.
Let me get back to how long do you think I'd last in Oklahoma?
I'd have to wear a mustache and do something.
Anyway, give me the next chart.
I'm going to Christ.
I'm going to Christ to everyone.
I'm in a Christing mood.
Ta-da!
Look, here's a whole list of Christings.
I want you to look at the next chart.
I want you to look at the next chart.
Τα δάδα, εδώ είναι το κλείδι της Χριστίας.
Θέλω να σας δείξω, λοιπόν, για τα άνθρωποι που νιώθαν ότι ο Ιησούς ήταν ο Ιησούς,

Αν δεν είπα.
Αυτό είναι ένας Έλληνος σκέφτερας!

Εντάξει, πιστή.
Αυτή είναι μια μονασία από Ιησούς.
Καιδίες, ξέρετε ότι είναι το τύπο του κόσμου.
Υπήρετε, πιστή.
Πιστήλες, πιστήλες.
Φυσικά.
και διάφορα πρόσφυγες.
Αυτό είναι το τρόπο της κόσμος.
Είχατε πίσω αυτές τις πρόσφυγες?
Θα δείτε να δείτε τα αγγεία σας εδώ, παιδιά.
Ναι, ναι, ναι, δεν είχαν really part of us.
Θα ήθελα να μεταφέρουν.
Αν λοιπόν,
Υπάρχει ένα κρυσμό

Αφήσεις έναν άνθρωπο που είναι άνθρωπος από το σχέδιο, αλλά πώς να πω αυτό.

but that's not what's going on. That's not what's going on. This is Christing and you're in the middle of it. Give it to me. Give it to me again. What was the, give it, go back.
She's cured. She's cured. Now why is this? Why is this? Diana is Christing the robes of Heracles with a drug that is meant to cause him to be attracted to and excited for her.
It is an aphrodisiac. You see, where has Heracles been for the last year? Diana is fed up with it. She's like, the dude's never around. Where is he? Where is the, where is he?
And it turns out he comes, comes back and he's got Yoli with him. Who is Yoli? You remember Cassandra? Meet Yoli. They did it again. They did it again. His shirt gets Christed.
It makes complete and total anthropological sense when you're looking at the medicine and the drugs that Jesus would also be Christing.
Yeah. Yeah. Now you know why. Now you know why. You thought it was a fairy tale and just boom, boom. He's the Christ. No. I'm sorry and people are beginning to wake up. They're beginning to see this and they're beginning to wake up and I want to talk to you a little bit.
Let me Christ a little bit more. Christ on you. Christ on you. Right on the glorious face. You've, right? Because in the, in the, in the idea of the ops, you've got this thing that radiates from your face, right? Your ops. Sometimes it's translated as your vision, but it has to do not with just your physical sight, but with your understanding of the world.
Right. The cool clops has that one circular vision.
It may have two eyes. Don't think he just has one. Right. Okay. Here we go. So what did she say? What does the wife empirically say? She says, look, the centaur, that seer, that beast. This is what he showed me.
He showed me this after he got, he got hit by the arrow because remember Hercules shot him, right? Cause he's messing around with his wife. And what did he show her? He showed her how to bring Achilles back. It was a love potion.
She said, I remembered it. This is for all the Mormons out there. I remembered it as if I had written it down on copper plates.
And what happened? She says, I did everything faithfully that he told me to do, the centaur. You know what I did? I made that drug. I put it into a place where it couldn't be touched by the light because he said, you know, something's bad is going to happen.
Right. And I hit it. I just took it and I brought it to the very innermost part. I brought it to the very innermost part of my womanly quarters, my womanly apartment, my womanly temple. I brought it there. Yeah.
Yeah. And what happened? I kept it safe until I could take it out and freshly Christ. Look at that bottom line. Third word in the bottom line.
Do you see how much Christing there is an antiquity flashed through these really quick? We're going to fly. We're going to fly now. She's Christing in her innermost Damos, right? That's in her oikos. That's in her house, but it's in her innermost chamber. That's sacred chamber. Her sacred chamber. Hit me with the next one. What are we going to do? And I want you to notice that these are associated with women.
These acts are women. Remember, this is number three. Number three things as Athenians. You oil yourself thoroughly in wrestling and in love. Yeah. If you aren't, it's because you're a barbarian, man. Listen to your stupid language.
Here we go. On anointing. Give the next one. Di a Christeo. One must anoint. You get into a situation with sorenus. See, sore, S-O-R. That's sorenus. 216 is working on gynecology. He's talking about the parts in gynecology that must be anointed. Did you know you're supposed to anoint yourself?
Did you know? And I'm talking to the audience of sore anus. I'm talking to the audience of the doctor who is the gynecologist. Anoint yourselves. Di a Christeo.
Okay. Di a Christos. Sabs. Look, you can just have ta di a Christa and it's sabs, just in general ointments. What a nice concept. Keep going.
An Christeo. One must anoint. Look, what do we get again? Sorenus. He's big on this Christing thing. Yes, because it's women's medicine. And when they're talking about Christing and women's medicine, they're talking about Christing the woman's privates.
They talk about Christing the men's privates too. But in these contexts, this is women's medicine. You're supposed to be Christed. All of these years. Jesus Christ. Okay, give me the next one. More Christing and we're going to call on you.
An Christos rubbed in. Look at that. You get a little bit more. It's not, you don't just lather this stuff on. You rub it in and look at where you rub it in. You rub it into the Othalmus, into the eyes.
You thought I was making it up when I said Christing is rubbing stuff into your eyes. No, it is. And do you know why they're doing that? The doctors all talk about it. It's enchantment.
It's changing your mental perceptions. Altered mental perceptions. That's what they're doing. They're inducing with the drugs. And some of them do it with the eyes.
Do you know that when Jesus was with that naked boy, and that naked boy has the bandage on his private part, and Jesus ends up with that goo on his face, in his eyes.
All right. It doesn't help to swallow it. The goo goes in the eyes says the Christ.
I know. I know. Where's my... I don't think I can take much more Christing. This is too much Christing. Everybody agree? I'm getting... I'm getting... Okay, give me a little more Christing. Just a little. People want...
If you're out there and you want more Christing, give it to me. This is the supply of oil for the Christing, Eliokristia. Good, good.
So, you know, there's like technical terms that are Christ terms. That's okay. Give it. And then we have the Epichristos. That's what smeared on.
Look at the pharmakha. The pharmakha that are smeared on. Right? Okay, good, good. Next one. How about the philochristos? Now, look, people, here's a late word. It's giving a sixth century on Odomini, right? From Palestine.
And what is it? It's a philochrist. Loving Christ. Loving Christ. So, you can watch. You can watch the development of the word so that next time you say Christ, you'll know what it means. Okay, give me the next one.
I hope we're past the ones that are making me sick in the time.
Just look, people, another idiocy at the end of it. That's another medical, another medical, again, talking about parts of the body that you need to anoint.
For those of you who didn't believe me a year ago, when I talked about the apocalypse, right, and the Trojiscoe, right?
You'll notice that it says here the Katachristos is for use as ointments or Trojiscoe.
Remember, those are the things that we always translate as seals. Ezekiel has them and those round circle things that they always paint.
Those Christians that paint that stuff, by the way, by the way, I had a word. I was supposed to tell you this.
Oh, and the word drug was there, too. Right there with the seals that you're talking about.
Okay, I was supposed to tell you, oh, shoot, what does the devil tell me to tell him?
Oh, it'll come back to me. It'll come back to me. Let me keep thanking. Go, give me the next one.
Λεωκό Χριστός, right? Whitewashed. Whitechristan. I wonder what it means to get Whitechristan. Give me the next one.
Μουρό. Oh, this is one of my favorites. This is one of my favorites. Anointed with the Angua.
Now, that's a really tame way of saying the sex drugs, right? The sex oil. Put on your sex oil. Why are they doing this?
Isn't everybody, you know, it's so common that they bring it to the stage.
Arrhez kafniz brings it to the stage. And the oiling up is the getting ready.
When it says that Palaistra was getting ready to wrestle, and she told him, get yourself ready.
What was she talking about? She was talking about the Myrochristing.
Ναι, έχεις ένα μυρό Χριστιασμό. Γιατί, γιατί θα είσαι σκοτωμένος.
Αν δεν θα είσαι σκοτωμένος, κάτι είναι σκοτωμένος. Εκεί είσαι μάθος να είσαι σκοτωμένος.
Τι θα γίνει εδώ, κάποιος, κάποιος πήγε αυτόν τον άνθρωπο. Βλέπω εδώ.
Λέντες, καλύτερες φορές. Λέντες, νέο κατά Χριστός.
Ωτε π Ferrari'τος' σκοτωμένη, δεν μη αγαίνει видели λίγα.
Βάση Чωρά, spreadι δεν με δι蹓ουν αρχτών.
Πενταγύολο και τιν Whenever to become your kid.
Λέντες, earthy.
