He's drugging these girls.
This is wild.
By the way, I just want to stop here
just to give you some context.
His student that he succeeded,
and it's in this text somewhere
where he says that this is a successor of Valentinus.
I think it's in the chapter before this where he says that.
He's a student of Valentinus
who was the second highest bishop in Rome
in the 150s of the Common Era.
140s, actually, I'm sorry, 140s.
So Valentinus had the second highest amount of votes
to become the bishop of Rome
and if that would have happened, he would be on your list.
I got my Catholic Bible right here.
If you open up your Catholic Bible,
it's got the list of succession of popes.
He's almost on this list.
Now, I know some scholars will say
but they weren't popes in the beginning.
The bishop of Rome didn't have that much power.
I don't care. I'm looking at this list
and I see Higanus
and I see Telusforus
and I see Pius from 140 to 155.
Pius is the guy.
I think it was either Higanus or Pius.
I think it was Higanus, 136 to 140.
So it was even earlier than I thought.
This is even earlier than I thought.
This is in the 130s.
Higanus is on the list.
Higanus is the guy that beat Valentinus out
for votes by a couple of votes.
I'm telling you, it was only a couple of votes.
That's what the sources say.
Now, just let that sink in.
The successor to that guy
whose church almost became the church of Rome
very close.
At least he would have been steering the ship a little bit more
in his own direction.
Who knows? We don't know.
We don't know what would have happened.
Maybe nothing would have happened. Who knows?
I'm just saying. That's what would have happened.
So he says this.
This is that guy.
And by the way, Marcosians are known to be
the biggest church in France
in the second and third century
after this guy.
So it says, pouring from the smaller one,
consecrated by the women
into that which has been brought forward by himself,
made that carousel
who is before all things
who transcends all knowledge and speech,
fill your inner man
and multiply in you
her own knowledge by sowing
the grain of mustard seed in you
as in good soil.
Repeating certain other like words
and thus goading on the wretched woman
to madness, he then appears
a worker of wonders.
So they're tripping balls off this stuff
and they're probably seeing visions
of Christ and Mary or whatever.
He's probably saying, see
it's my Eucharist.
Told you.
And that's how he does it.
So they basically talk about it.
Then he says, it appears probable enough
that this man possesses a demon
as his familiar spirit
by means of whom he seems
able to prophecy.
Basically, he's pulling off
this guy's admitting
that whatever this guy's doing
is working.
And also enables as many as he counts
worthy to be partakers
of his carousel themselves
to prophecy.
He devotes himself especially to women
and those such who are well-bred
and elegantly attired and have great
well, who he frequently seeks
to draw after him
by addressing them in such seductive
words as these.
I am eager to make you a partaker
of my grace, carousel.
Since the Father of all
does continually behold your angel
before his face.
Now the place of your angel is among us
these are his words.
This is a quote from him.
Let me start that over. This is a quote from Marcus.
I am eager to make you
partake of my carousel
since the Father of all
does continually behold your angel
before his face.
Whatever that means.
Now the place of your angel is among us.
Behooves us to become one.
Receive first from me
and by the gift of
carousel.
Adorn yourself as a bride
who is expecting her bridegroom
that you may be what I am
and what you are.
Establish the germ of light
in your nuptial chamber.
Receive from me a spouse
and become receptive of him.
While you are received by him
behold carousel
who has descended upon you.
Open your mouth in prophecy
and the woman replying
I have never at any time
prophesied nor do I know how to
prophecy. Then
engaging for the second time
in certain invocations
as to astound his deluded victim
he says to her
open your mouth speak
whatsoever occurs to you
and you shall prophecy
since then vainly puffed up
and elated by these words
and greatly excited in soul
by the expectation that is
herself who is the prophecy
her heart beating violently
by the way shout out to Hippolytus
for writing this this is good shit
her heart beating violently from emotion
reaches though requisite
pitch of audacity
and idly
as well as impudently utter some
nonsense as it happens
to occur to her such as might
be expected from one huge from an empty spirit
referring to this one superior
to me has observed
that the soul is both audacious
and impudent when heated
with empty air
henceforth she reckons herself
a prophetess
I wonder what I want to think about the heated part
henceforth she reckons herself as a prophetess
and expresses her thanks
to Marcus for having imparted
to her of his own carousel
she then makes the effort
to reward him not only by the gift
of her possessions in which he has
collected a large very fortune
by the way there's probably some truth to this
because like I said he goes on to start
the biggest church in all of
France he basically brings
Christianity to the Gauls
basically he's like
he's like known for that
then it says but already
some of the most faithful women
possessed of the fear of God and not
being deceived
but abhorring
and excreting him have withdrawn
from such vile company of revelers
this they have done as being well aware
that the gift of prophecy
whoops what did I just do
oh here we go
so it is not conferred on men by Marcus the magician
Marcus the magus
but that only those to whom
God sends his grace
from above possesses the vile inspire
so he's talking shit you know
last thing I wanted to show on this part
by here
he says Marcus compounds filters
and love potions
this guy loves drugs and purple shit right
and it says in order
to insult the persons of some
of these women if not all of them
those of them who have returned
to the church of God I think frequently
occurs have acknowledged
confessing to that they have been
defiled by him
wow and that they were filled
with a burning passion
towards him
a sad example of this
occur in the case of a certain
Asiatic one of our deacons
who had received him
why are they all getting tricked by him if he's so evil
how are they all going back to him all the time
but something's going on here
who had received him into his house
his wife
a woman of remarkable beauty
fell a victim both in mind and beauty to this magician
and for a long time
traveled about with him
at last with no small difficulty
the brethren had converted her
she spent her whole time in exercise
public confession blah blah blah
but yeah anyways he's a magus
he makes a lot of drugs
he says and they say it's hurt that they themselves
know more than all others
and that they alone have imbided the greatness
of the gnosis of the knowledge
of what is unspeakable
the mysteries
but what I think
when I'm reading something like this
this shows me
even though Hippolytus
who was writing this 50 years later
he's writing this 50 years later
Hippolytus is not a primary source
to
oh he's a primary source that we're reading him
but he's not a primary
witness to these events
he's writing about stuff that happened 50 years before him
so when I read this
and I think Hippolytus is looking back
at the time of Christianity
happening in the 130s
130s of the common era
130s and 140s
and this is a time where Christianity is looking
way different
and that's what this tells me
the Christians who were in charge
and running the churches
were doing way different shit
and it was way more mystery like
a lot more Eucharists
and baptisms and as you can see here
this guy is going his own extra route
there's a couple of drugs to the Eucharists
I'm not sure how many other churches are doing that
I mean
I would guess maybe there's more than one
just saying
what do you think about that
yeah
you found them
everybody put your hands up
the cops are all outside
you found them
you got them surrounded
good FBI job
real quick
but there's a mystery
so one of
this is actually one of Diogenes students
I have this text right here from Diogenes
and one of his students
his name Theodorus
there's a story about this guy Theodorus
and one day Theodorus
was sitting beside a herofant
Euraclades
and he says tell me Euraclades
who are those
who violate the mysteries
and when the herofant replied
those who reveal them
to the uninitiated
Theodorus then said
you know he's learned from Diogenes
how to be slick
he says then you yourself
are violating them when you expound them
to the uninitiated
because you have to reveal the mysteries to the uninitiated
in order to initiate them
and this is what it says after that
he would hardly have escaped
from being hauled in front of the court
of Areopagos
but if Demetrius of Philarion
had not come to his rescue
there's Demetrius popping up in that history books again
he's everywhere
bravo bravo hit the clip
show these people set it up
look what you found this is like a
this is an expose that Neal's got going on
I'm serious this is like huge
renaissance
business
do you think
is your clip on the bottom play or do I have to play my own
my own
most scholars would say
the Moses tradition probably started
being written down in the
700s
maybe the late
800s BCE
they are probably writing the Moses stories down
sometime in the 700s BCE
what would you say to that
okay so when I hear
