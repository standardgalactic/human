Yeah, and you want to think about why things
mean that they do because the Spartans
are the ones who were into that.
Right?
What you're talking about is the Spartans...
You're going to laugh.
Josephus has a letter, a supposed letter
from the king of the Spartans,
writing to the king or the high priest or somebody
to the Jews.
I can't remember who.
But it's preserved in Josephus
and the king of the Spartans tells the Jews
we're all sons of Abraham together.
I figured you'd laugh at that from what you just said.
There's no way.
Yeah.
That's good.
That's good.
I like that.
I like that.
Yeah.
And it fits.
You know, it fits.
But we Athenians, we're not going to do that.
We've got things like democracy
and that's a big deal to us.
I thought it was a fantastic interview.
I thought you did a fantastic job.
Was there anything from it
that you just wanted to say,
hey, it's also important
that he was able to show me this
because obviously he moved your timeline down.
You lost like a century off of Jewish history.
It's like, well, then go back that far.
It just wasn't around.
You know what, it makes me realize
because if this is true,
that people are like, let's put this timeline together.
Judaism did not exist before 300 BC.
Just did not exist.
There is no such thing as Judaism before that.
Everyone's polytheistic.
You get these texts put together
at this time around the 300s,
around the early 370 to 300, whatever.
And then it sits there
and it's just sort of like,
it just belongs to a certain group of Alexandrian Jews
who are interested in this stuff
and then Jerusalem might take it back to their city
and they had these texts.
The average person is not reading that text yet.
Not right away.
It takes a century and a half
for people to start knowing about this Torah.
And it's like, finally, all of a sudden,
according to the evidence of the archaeology,
in the 150s,
and it actually makes sense that it's the 150s
because it's right after the Hasmonean revolt.
And the Hasmonean revolt,
according to the text itself,
makes it clear that there was a huge conservative push
in Judea to follow only Yahweh
and to follow the Mosaic law.
So it's finally around the 150s BCE
when Judaism becomes a thing.
And then, only 150 years later, Jesus is born.
Christianity is not that far off from Judaism.
Most people think Judaism
is like thousands of years before Christianity.
No, they're like almost a century apart from each other.
It's it.
They come at the same time.
Yeah.
Just like the worship of Aten.
And the monism in Egypt in the 14th BC.
You can see Mediterranean society was free of monism
until the first, second, late second, or first.
What date would you put it at?
When does the monism...
You know what?
You're not going to like this,
but I read a lot of pre-socratics shit.
Those pre-socratics flirted with monism,
but not in the monotheistic way.
Yeah.
Just in a sense that they believe,
and this is very Platonic,
Plato thought this too.
And some of the pre-socratics before Plato
were...
Phales is one of these.
The archae, the one, the first one,
the prince, the highest, the one, the hen.
And they thought that there was this one
above all the cosmos.
And this one produces, you know,
eros from the chaos.
And then you get...
So they still accept Hesiod.
They still accept Homer.
But what they're doing is they're saying
that these gods are under some one.
So that idea, that monism idea,
to me, starts around the 6th century BCE,
where you get monism.
And I think it's a pre-socratic idea.
But like I said, it's not in the way that people are...
Not in the way that it's done by
Judeans and Christians in the 1st century.
They take monism, they put it on steroids.
Because the pre-socratics were very specific about the one.
There is no...
You and I don't even talk to this one.
We have demons in between.
We cannot talk to the one.
It's way beyond our comprehension.
This is what Heraclitus would say, or Paraminides.
Okay.
So if you're tracing it,
if you're tracing it through the Greek pre-socratics,
doesn't it make sense
that the Septuagint is the original language?
These people are coming through Alexandria,
being educated in Greek and Alexandria.
Doesn't it make much more historical sense
that Hebrew is not the original language,
but is a Greek work that's filtering through Greek ideas
that you just pointed out.
The influence of Mother Greek was so great
that Hebrew was nothing then.
It was nothing.
It was liturgical.
It was gone.
As a matter of fact,
I don't think we can even say it was liturgical anymore.
Because if you're saying Judaism gets here,
starts being practiced as a monist religion
in the 2nd or 1st century,
we have to say those traditions are fake.
They didn't have any traditions.
That's when they bring back Hebrew
and they start writing in Hebrew at that time.
Because they're writing in Greek before that.
Right.
No, and they're speaking Greek.
All Greek names.
Aristotle is a Greek name.
Aristotle is like reformers.
You know what I mean?
People don't understand.
They think Jews and Alexandria
were all reactive against Hellenism.
They weren't.
There's plenty of the population
that had been speaking Greek
and raised Greek
and had access to Greek education
that you don't need.
You don't need another class of people to follow it.
You've got other people who are supporting it.
But monism is an idea
that seems to have been played around with
by the pre-Socratic Greeks.
The Platonists and Plato himself
in his nomoi, in his laws,
wrote about the gymnasium being a place of evil.
You can tell this is Plato's lateness like
an old loser.
Because you read Plato's earlier works.
I love early Plato.
And the symposium is amazing.
You're writing about eros and love and Dionysus.
But this later Plato,
almost sexuality is wicked, evil.
You need to get rid of it.
The gymnasium needs to be eradicated.
He's turning into a conservative full blown.
And those ideas, I think,
and so does Gamerkin think,
that's what you get with...
I think Judaism is being influenced by Platonism.
That's what I think is happening.
I think it's Platonism on steroids.
You know, I think some great thinkers
would think alike.
Like Nietzsche would say the same thing.
They saw that classical origin,
that classical font.
And when people realize,
oh, your religion goes back to this...
Hey, by the way,
and this is my next question.
People are going to say
that you are crazy
if you start showing them that
Judaism began
as late as the 2nd and 1st.
What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
I'm going to do exactly what
Yonatan Edler said when I asked him...
When I paraphrased what
Dan said,
700.
I'm going to say, how do you know that?
Show me the evidence.
Look, we have evidence of...
We know what it looks like.
We know what archeological sites look like.
We know there is people in Egypt
doing circumcision.
We even know there's other places
doing circumcision,
like up in the north.
And I think Assyria,
they're doing certain types of it.
So this practice is around,
but they're not doing it in Judea
all the way up until 150s.
Nobody's doing it.
And that's one of the most important laws
according to the story of Abraham.
7th day, your child should be circumcised.
And they're not doing it.
And they're eating pork.
And they're worshiping other gods.
And they're minting coins
with Athena on it.
So my thing would be is,
show me where people are starting
to show knowledge of the Torah.
And the answer to that question
is the evidence shows it's somehow...
It happens sometime in the 3rd to 2nd century BC.
Period.
You just can't find evidence
and any other claim,
like when Dan says,
all confident,
we scholars all think
that it happened in the 700s.
Why not 1300 BC then?
What's the difference?
Because your evidence is exactly the same.
There's no fucking difference
between 700 and 900, 950, 1370.
You're just making shit up.
Why 700s?
And it's all...
It is weird.
I know he's a Mormon.
It is odd that in the Mormon tradition,
there's a prophet.
One of the prophets,
I think it's Nehi or whatever.
Nehi or Lehi.
I don't even know.
I don't know how to study that shit at all.
It's totally off my radar.
I have no idea what I'm talking about.
So I'm just going to give a little warning.
I have no idea what I'm saying.
But I do know that that prophet
supposedly lived in the 700s in Egypt.
So it makes sense
that Moses had to have been around in the 700s
because my prophet needs to hear about Moses
or else the whole thing blows up.
So there's a theological reason
why he wants to push them into the 700s.
Notice how he threw in that little...
Maybe 800s?
Why did you say that?
What made you say that?
What happened in your brain
that made you say maybe 800s?
Is there some sort of evidence in the 800s
that we can look at?
No.
You just said that randomly.
It's just so odd.
You know what that is?
That's that funny burning feeling
you get in your nethers
when you're in the back alley
and you're like...
That little touch that he had
is maybe a little bit early.
You just...
Look, you could have said that
for 500 years,
either way of your mark
and with the same assurance.
You know what I mean?
And that's why when he said
about the Christ thing,
he said preposterous,
that is the act of the...
It's not cowardice.
It's projecting a confidence
that will float your point.
You don't care about evidence.
The guy that you interviewed,
that dude has obviously built his career
on evidence and handling evidence.
Look at this.
Yeah, this is what we need.
Look at Lehi from the Book of Mormon.
He lived 600...
So 7th century BC.
So think about it.
He needs Moses to be around
in the 700s or the 7th century BC
for this to work.
If Moses is not around before Lehi,
Mormonism is dead.
Dead in the water, gone.
It's impossible.
For his random guy living in Jerusalem
to be one of the few people
who knows who Moses is.
You know what I mean?
So that's all I'm just saying.
The guy, he claims to be a descendant of Joseph.
He's making shit up.
What's the difference between this
