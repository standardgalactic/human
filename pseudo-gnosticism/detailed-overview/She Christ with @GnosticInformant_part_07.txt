and saying, I don't know,
the Torah existed in 900 BC.
Why not?
They're both the same claim.
They both have no evidence.
They're just baseless claims.
It's all it is.
And you can get away with it, right?
Because this is what you do
as a monist religion.
You have to re-educate people
into a history that you've crafted.
That's what monism does,
is it tries to hijack culture
by splitting the timeline into another...
You're in another mental world
and you think this is your history.
Imagine how many Jewish people
across the planet...
Imagine how they would have to come to grips.
I mean, what would the thinking be?
What if I just found out?
I thought my culture was ancient.
Ancient, ancient was the bedrock
and foundation of the 10 commandments.
And now I find out a bunch of Greeks
were moving through this part of the Mediterranean
and bumped up against the Phoenicians there, right?
And by the way, for those of you who like Phoenician,
how much literature was left behind?
Not much.
You know what? Mother Greek killed you, too.
Right?
By the way, another claim that's made, too,
is that some of the stuff
that they find in these older Babylonian myths
that make their way into the Old Testament,
they use that as sort of like a way to leverage...
Oh, it's really old because it's got these texts.
But those texts, those very same texts,
are also cited by Greeks living in the Hellenistic era.
So those texts, that argument's dead
because those texts are still around
in the same time periods that we're talking about.
So you can't... That doesn't make it older.
Those texts are older, but the texts are still around
in later times.
People still don't know how to read and write in Cuneiform
up until I think 100 A.D.
was when Cuneiform dies finally.
So people still knew...
There was one of the scribes of Alexander the Great using Cuneiform.
Say, today, King Alexander has died.
We have that.
So that's another nonsense thing.
The other one, the point, too, is like, there's a character...
And this is what Kipp was saying to me.
And this is a good point, Kipp made.
He wrote it from the Bible.
Balaam, son of Pior, the prophet.
And they found...
They actually did find a text inscribed on a wall
where this guy's mentioned.
And it's in some sort of building that existed
probably in the 7th, 6th century BC, something like that.
Now, that to me is interesting
because, okay, now we have a prophet
who's mentioned in older texts that makes his way into the older...
into a newer text.
But his name, Homer,
should be dated to 1350 BC
because Agamemnon's in the story.
Agamemnon is a Mycenaean king
whose place in history at the time of the Trojan War,
which is way back in the Bronze Age.
So characters existing in a text later...
If there was more of that going on,
I would be more convinced,
but just having one guy to...
One or two guys to point to...
This is not enough for me, you know?
I saw...
I saw that you were looking into the medical texts there
and wandering through.
And I wanted to ask you,
why is it that we have medical texts from Egypt?
We have medical texts from Rome
and we have medical texts from Greece.
And Greece has by far the most, right?
The most advanced stuff, right?
The Sanskrit has some medical texts too.
Real medical.
Why is it that we don't have any
Ascan, Umbrian,
or Hebrew medical texts?
The very same reason.
People think that Hebrew was actually spoken
when Jesus Christ was walking around.
They were like Shalom, Jesus.
He was like Shalom, right?
No.
In Hebrew, they didn't have Aramaic.
They had Greek.
And people say, oh, the apostles that wrote
the, you know, the gospels and whatnot,
that those people were...
Originally they speak Hebrew.
They didn't want to go home from their lunch break, right?
They speak Hebrew.
That's a joke.
That's a joke.
Those are all native speakers.
I'm telling you, 35 years of reading Greek,
I'm telling you, those are all native speakers.
Your little theory about there being Hebrew there
is a giant joke.
But it's part, it's not funny because it's meant
to alter that historical timeline.
So that people in the future will think,
oh, this was the past.
No, it wasn't as Neil showed tonight.
The stuff didn't even show up until the second, bro.
Which makes sense.
Do you understand the powder that you just uncovered?
This is real powder.
This is the good stuff because Jesus is not that far
then from the very origin of Judaism,
from the very earliest, monest Jewish cult.
Jesus is only a century, century half away.
That's amazing.
That's absolutely amazing.
Yeah, some of the Greek texts that I'm reading,
some of the translations that I'm reading,
from Loeb, for example, what is Polybius and Celest,
they cite Punic texts that are lost.
But so the Punic had a writing culture.
The Punic is just another word for Phoenician.
It's like Latin word for Phoenician.
The Punics, the Carthaginians and the Phoenicians,
they did have a writing culture,
and they did write philosophical, medical,
and they wrote agricultural stuff.
But we lost it all.
The only way we have it is from people like Polybius and Celest,
citing it.
So they write about people like Mago,
as one of these Carthaginian writers,
as a couple other ones.
So they did have somewhat of a literate culture
going on in the seafaring Phoenician world.
But you're right.
In Hebrew, it's like a black hole of,
there's no grammarians that you don't have.
You have grammarians in Latin,
you have grammarians in Greek,
you have grammarians in Sanskrit.
They're very literate,
these are very literate cultures writing about writing.
Writing about letters,
writing about writing.
But you can't find something like that.
All we have is biblical text.
And then when you get to the Dead Sea Scrolls,
that's when you find like, oh, you know,
laws for the community.
That's it.
You find stuff like that,
and then there's a big black hole,
and then you go all the way back to Ugarit.
So in between Ugarit and the Old Testament,
there's like a big black hole
where all you get is inscriptions.
But you also have Elephantine,
and Elephantine, it's Aramaic.
No, they're Jews.
They call themselves Judeans.
They fled the wrath of the Assyrians.
And so we do have some stuff,
but all of it points to not knowing who Moses is,
not knowing who Abraham is,
and being a part of the regular Mediterranean world
like everyone else.
I like how you said it.
You just brought it all together and said,
look, this is the Mediterranean, baby.
And they're just developing.
It's not that there aren't cultural Jews, right?
Ethnic Jews, but they aren't practicing Judaism.
They're not separating themselves off
from the rest of the world like people think they do.
Yeah.
And that's a beautiful thing to know.
Yeah.
It is.
People should know that.
And I know a lot of people
that I interacted with in Israel,
and by the way,
your guest, I think, was involved in the dig
at Tel Magyta, right?
Yes, yes.
So that's really cool.
That's heads up.
I salute, right?
You might have walked into it in the 90s.
When were you there?
Yeah, 91.
I was there in 91.
Yeah, he probably was there.
I bet he probably didn't remember me
because I was just a dirt mover, you know what I mean?
But I could tell him.
He'll remember if because of the floor,
because of the temple floor that our group found.
He'll remember.
I'll tell him.
I was with them.
Love it.
Love it.
I want to ask you though, as you peel back this layer,
you're going to be dealing now with scholars of the Bible
who are going to have that mindset that,
oh, the prophet Isaiah, this is Iron Age,
this is the kingdom of David,
kingdom of this and that, for which there's nothing, right?
What are you going to do in order to push that knowledge forward?
Like if you're a part of the museum
and you're trying to push it forward, what do you do?
Do you just make documentaries
and just kind of try to expose the real history?
What do you do?
That's what I said.
So my last time I was on this channel
was probably over a month ago,
and I said that in the next couple of days
I was dropping that video
and then responding to some of the stuff
that happened in the Dan and Danny video.
And I didn't lie about that.
That video's been done for over,
for like weeks and weeks and weeks.
But the reason why I haven't dropped it yet
is because I wanted to drop this video first
because I used some of the clips for the video.
Does that make sense?
So you're going to see when I dropped the video
on my response to some of the stuff
that Dan McLellan was saying on Danny's show,
which I thought was just a complete shit show,
to be honest.
First of all, the Lucian thing was kind of crazy,
not knowing Lucian.
That's the main source for Syrian religion.
What does that text call?
A Syrian goddess.
That's Lucian's work.
And that's one of the biggest texts
that we'll go to for Arabian
and Syrian religion of the Levant.
Because that's like all we have
other than the inscription of the ideology.
So you can't be an expert in religions
and not in all Lucian.
You have to know Lucian.
That was like, whoa.
And then he's being shown,
he's being shown the Hilaria.
And any Roman religion expert
knows all about Hilaria.
This isn't some like back alley,
random thing that you find in one text.
Hilaria is all over the place.
And when he's being shown the Hilaria,
his face, he goes like this.
He does that.
He goes, huh?
Like he's never seen it before.
And this is like,
read Mary Beards book, Roman religion.
By the way, how does he not know this?
Anyone who studies ancient religion,
you've got to know Mary Beards book, at least.
It's one of those introduction books.
You agree with me on that.
It's one of those introduction books
that you have to have.
Yeah, yeah, no.
I used to teach the course class.
Classical religion.
And I use your textbook.
I totally disagree with her on some things.
Oh, me too.
I use your textbook.
Yeah.
And I agree with you on that.
But here's the thing though.
She talks about the Hilaria
in comparison to Easter,
just like you and I do.
Because it's just like, why wouldn't you?
There's so many parallels.
And she stays out of her lane
and she doesn't study Hebrew Bible
in the New Testament.
So she doesn't make conclusions
and says one's copying the other.
All she's doing is pointing out,
whoa, look at this Hilaria festival.
Well, they celebrate a death
and resurrection of a God.
Cool.
That's it.
She just gives you the facts
when you do what you want with it.
But Dan, when he's being showed
this information,
he tilts his head and goes, huh?
That's not right.
Dude, how do you not know
about the Hilaria?
And to not know about the Hilaria
is a big deal
because you make it your business
to refute anybody
who tries to argue about, you know,
a paganism influencing Christianity,
which I get that there's a lot
of really bad information online.
A lot of people who just are like
making shit up about Horus,
