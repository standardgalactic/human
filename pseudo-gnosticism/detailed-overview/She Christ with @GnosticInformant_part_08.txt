having 12 disciples
and being crucified.
That didn't happen in the sources.
But at the end of the day,
there are some legitimate parallels
and there are legitimate sources
that people do need to know about
because it's fascinating stuff.
And he's out there, like,
putting his foot down,
saying there's nothing here,
dying and rising gods don't exist.
This is all made up nonsense.
Anybody who talks about this
doesn't know that.
And it's like, if you don't even know
what the Hilaria is,
then why are you even talking
about James Frazier?
Because that's like half
of James Frazier's book.
Hilaria is all...
That's like a...
Not half of his book,
but that's like 10% of his book
has to do with Addis and the Hilaria.
So it's like, how do you not know...
If you don't know Hilaria,
then why are you even talking
about James Frazier?
Because you obviously
never read James Frazier.
You just...
Now you're just making
shit up at this point.
So you'll see.
I'm getting all fired up about it.
But I got some stuff to say.
I got some stuff to say.
Look at how fired up you get.
Everybody in Satanic congregation,
that's fired up, right?
For those sources.
Because you're just
protecting those sources.
I totally...
I love that.
I love that.
I want to ask you
one last question
that's pressing.
I want to know
once you bring this to people,
their response is going to be
because it's always been
something's wrong with you, right?
The reason I was going to tell you
the reason that people still think
the Old Testament
or the Torah was originally written
in Hebrew is only
because of that first BC
and first AD culture
that was coming up,
that was creating that
modest propaganda, right?
If the text is only as old
as the third century,
it means all of those claims
about the land
and about who it belongs to,
all of those are created.
Those are not historical actualities.
That's the creation
of the third or second century, yeah.
You don't even know how right you are
because if you're looking at this,
it's just a historical thing.
Israel existed
at the time of Nebuchadnezzar
and we know this
because Nebuchadnezzar
brags about taking over Israel.
They get stomped out.
They lose their kingdom
and then they're subject to
whoever's in power,
whether it be the Assyrians,
the Babylonians,
the Persians,
the Greeks,
the Seleucids, the Ptolemies
and they're just kind of waiting there.
It's not until the Hasmonean period
as we mentioned
after the Maccabeean revolt
where Israel finally gets
their own state back
around 164 BC.
So it makes sense.
Like you said, there's no like,
they don't own anything.
They're just people that live there.
They don't own anything
and then they do end up
getting their state at that time
but like,
literally less than a century later,
they're being stacked by Pompey already.
Done.
They lose their own.
They don't even hold it
for 100 years.
63 BCE.
The Maccabeean revolt was in 164.
That's 100 years.
But even before,
you're right.
The point you're making about
who owns what,
that's such a muddy waters,
gray area
because there really is no ownership
over anything.
You're just people that live there.
You know what I mean?
They're all getting sacked, right?
By the big powers in the area.
Right?
It's all of that movement of power.
Hera the great
is making deals with the Romans
saying, we'll be your client state.
We'll watch your borders for you.
Just make sure you take care of us
and send us the needs
that we need.
You know, send us troops
so we need it.
And that's what happened.
It's almost like in America today,
how we support Israel.
That's how the Romans were for Israel
for a while.
Yeah.
Until Nero.
And then Nero changed that.
But then they went back to
doing what they were doing again,
back to your client state.
And then Hadrian
had some things to say.
But that was the end of it.
After Hadrian,
they never went back until 1948.
So you can literally count
the number of people
who have been there
and have been in the cities.
Less than a...
I don't even know.
I'm not going to say right now.
But it's not...
They don't have the land
for thousands of years.
That's not a thing.
Right.
No.
No.
No.
And the archeological...
The archeological remains
exposed that.
Right?
That they would have way more
of these settlements
that they would find.
Way more of the cities.
We even...
I was at the...
And it was like, dude,
is that all they found?
Right?
Is there...
Was there no other habitation here?
So a lot that...
The theological drive to say,
oh, it must be the palace of Ahab
during the Kingdom of Sohan.
So it's just an attempt
to fit on that biblical narrative.
Now, if we push the biblical narrative
all the way down to the third
and second centuries,
and we say, look,
this stuff is coming from Greek.
It's not coming from Hebrew.
They're back translating it into Hebrew
to try to create a tradition
for themselves.
And they're doing it out
in the middle of nowhere.
Right?
Why are those people
with the Dead Sea Scrolls,
the ones that have both the Greek
and then the Hebrew back translation?
Why do they have...
Why are they out in the middle
of the desert?
Where are all the libraries
in Jerusalem?
And people will say,
well, there aren't any.
How about the libraries?
How about the libraries
of Ash or Bonipol?
People say, oh, look,
we have this great Nileva.
We have this great library
of so-and-so.
And they open it up.
You look at the stuff
that's in that, Neil.
It's garbage.
You're not finding epics
and scientific documents.
And here's the government
and the history section.
You're not finding that.
You're finding laundry lists
of shit that...
Lugals, the Gacy,
Emperor of everything.
You get mythology.
You get King's List.
You get law codes.
Kind of what you get.
And you're right.
And a lot of...
A lot of, like,
a lot of Ostraca,
which are just, like, little notes.
Like, hey, meet me...
Meet me in six months
in this place.
Why don't you get philosophy?
Why don't you get philosophy out of it?
That's a good question.
I think philosophy is a product
of Persian period,
especially in the Middle East.
I mean, obviously, there's not...
I mean, I'm philosophy,
depending on how we define it.
But, like, strict,
philosophical thinking,
that's a Persian period idea,
I think.
I thank you.
I thank your presecratics.
So predate those Persians.
Give me the name besides...
Oh, no, no, no.
You're right.
Though some of those presecratics
were around during the Assyrians.
When the Assyrians
are sacking Judea,
there's Greek presecratics
writing stuff already.
At the mine.
In the six months.
No, no, no.
Thales.
Even Sappho.
Sappho was alive
before the Persians were in power.
Sappho was alive
during the Neo-Babylonian Empire.
Also not getting any lyric, right?
Those Greeks do predate
a lot of these big swings in history.
Yeah.
The Greeks are making those,
even the lyric poetry.
This is such a good point
that you're making,
because people...
There's a myth
that Greek influence
starts with Alexander the Great.
Before that,
there's no Greek influence.
That's wrong.
Greek influence starts
way before that.
As we mentioned,
the Athenian coins.
The coins with Zeus on it.
Greeks have a lot of influence,
and they're very cultural people.
People like their...
People like the Minoans
and the Mycenaeans
and they're adopting the way they dress
and the purple and all that.
Purple die from Minoans.
A lot of the culture
does come from the Greeks.
Even if it's Mycenaean Greeks,
Minoan Greeks,
or even Hittites
who are
very closely related
through their
Pulascian ancestry, we'll say.
They're using the same alphabet
and the Lydians are writing.
They're basically
very Greek close to Greek, Lydian.
I think Lydians
consider Greek, right?
No, I'm not sure about that,
to be honest.
Usually you can see
Lydian roots very obviously.
I don't know to what degree.
It's the Ionian.
It's the cousin of the Ionian
