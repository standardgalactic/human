that it's up against.
Yeah.
It's like Lydian and Greek
is like Aramaic and Hebrew.
They're very close.
They have a lot of the same vocabulary.
Maybe a little bit different grammar.
But they worship the same gods.
Lydians are worshiping Aphrodite.
They're worshiping Artemis.
They're worshiping Apollo and Zeus.
And they're writing in the same...
So it's the same cultural.
The same...
I think your types are like that too.
Hang on though.
Let me ask you this question.
So you do see it on the Greek side.
You see, oh, this is a Lydian root.
But here's the question.
How come there aren't any Lydian texts left?
Why don't we have Lydian...
I will hold on to you on that.
The Lydians invented minted coins.
They get credit for it.
The idea of having a minted coin
with a base on it,
or like that's Lydian.
Lydians invented that.
I bet you they used the Greek language to do so.
I bet you they did.
It's the Greek alphabet.
Can you see how the Greek language just absorbed?
It's such a superior machine.
People like Marcus Aurelius were like,
you know, I'm going to use it.
And when I write philosophical documents,
I'm going to use the Greek because it's capable.
It's capable of doing that.
It's not a race thing.
The funny thing is this is what really shocks me.
Life is not about your race.
There's nothing to do with your race.
It's totally incident.
It's about your language.
Because history shows that the more powerful the language,
the more the spread.
And with that spread of that language
comes more technical knowledge,
comes more development.
You get philosophy only when you have a language
that can convey the philosophy.
And I love it.
I want to make love to Mother Greek.
That's what I want to do.
I want to pull this up real quick.
It's the last thing.
This shows you how close Lydians and Greeks are.
It says,
Carisius is credited as issuing the first true gold coins
with a standard circulation.
But look at this.
He claims the scent from the original Agamemnon,
who conquered Troy.
They know they're reading Homer
all the way in Asia Minor.
Greek influence is everywhere.
You know what I mean?
Yeah, and it is a Greek song, remember?
Homer's Greek song.
Homer's Greek.
I love it, man.
I love it. That's absolutely gorgeous.
Neil, thank you for coming tonight.
I want to point out to everybody
that Neil's going to come out with this new interview
and take a look at it.
Love it. When are you going to launch that?
Well, the one that we saw,
the one that we showed the preview of today,
that's out right now.
Oh, it's out right now. Go watch it, people.
As soon as you're done here, go watch it.
Yeah, whatever you're ready to watch it.
Yeah, and let's start it.
What you're going to do is you're going to start some kind of giant discussion
in the world of history.
Is what you're going to do in religion.
People are going to be...
They're going to say something like you're demon possessed.
I can feel it. I can feel them doing it right now.
That's the kind of stuff they're going to say.
In fact, you've got 15,000 views in the first 12 hours,
so it's doing pretty well.
What are you doing slumming with me, man?
What are you, 15,000?
You get more live views than I do now.
You get thousands of people watching when you go live,
but I'm nothing compared to you now.
No, absolutely not.
Why do we do this?
That's the best way to do it.
Because we love it and we're inspired by the muse.
I'm not doing this because I'm trying to griff or make money.
I'm doing this because it's my passion.
Because I'm inspired to do it.
We both agree on that part.
You can totally see that.
You can totally see that with you too, Neil.
There's a zeal that you're doing.
I thank Satanic congregation.
I think everybody that watches initiating apocalypse
and all the little bits that I do,
I think those people all appreciate that.
I don't mean to speak for everybody,
but I think they really appreciate that.
That's why you do such a great job.
You're going to go have some great interviews coming up
and stuff like that too.
Documentary that I've been working on
for a long time now that's going to come out
after the DanResponse video.
It's going to be a video about the Dark Ages.
Comparing the Dark Ages to the classical period.
I already recorded most of it.
So that's on its way too.
Make sure and get those really skinny.
I found an article from this Duschi Bible scholar-nerd.
I don't even know if he has a Ph.D. I don't think he does.
I think he has like a master or something.
I think he like failed out or something.
But he's one of these like Bible scholar type of people.
He calls himself the history for atheists.
He has a whole article about how the Dark Ages
is such a bad term, you shouldn't use it.
Because it was actually really good.
Christians were actually really cool.
Bullshit.
I'm going to show with evidence that that's bullshit.
That's the Dark Ages, even though that's a term
that's obviously subjective in itself.
But if we define it by literature,
which is what Petrarch and who are those guys
that talked about the Dark Ages.
Petrarch is the guy he coined the term.
You know, those Renaissance guys who used that term Dark Ages,
they were using that term for literature.
They weren't talking about the economy.
They weren't talking about armies.
They weren't talking about logistics.
They're talking about literature, text.
And if you take the definition,
the way Petrarch, you wanted the definition to be used,
he's absolutely right.
There was Dark Ages. The texts are trash.
Someone just sent to me one time.
They go, what about Beowulf?
Beowulf, that's all you can come up with.
From 500 BC AD to 1300, you got Beowulf.
You're going to compare that to Homer?
Are you kidding me?
Can you tell me what's the answer from Beowulf?
I don't know shit about Beowulf.
Nobody does.
It's not a household.
Nobody's talking about Beowulf.
It's had such a problem.
You're just trying to find something.
Oh look, Arthur.
Okay, fine. There's one.
I don't know.
I've read some of that King Arthur stuff
in the medieval Latin and it's terrible.
It's absolutely terrible.
No, I don't mean that either.
It does not stack up to Euripides and Homer and Sapo.
No.
Pindar.
Pindar.
Pindar, come on.
We can go on for days.
The list goes on.
There's no comparison.
You got through.
It's not until the renaissance when people start
writing good shit again.
You got the love series for you to be able
to peruse through Disney.
Were you surprised at how many Greek
authors are in it?
Oh yeah.
It's crazy.
You know what else surprises me
is how much we don't have.
Because you and I both know
because we both read a lot of primary sources
because we just love to do it.
They cite a lot.
Those Greeks were citing stuff.
You don't get a lot of citations
in the Hebrew Bible.
No one's citing anything.
But these Greeks, like Herodotus,
they're mentioning other historians before him.
He's mentioning the names of their books.
Other people will even mention those same names
in books.
You can make a list of hundreds,
maybe a thousand people who are cited
who we lost.
Oh yeah.
Just in Galen.
Just in Galen alone because he is always
citing older physicians.
He loves to cite Hellenistic physicians.
Most of them are names that we don't.
Who the hell is that?
Right?
And there's dozens upon dozens upon dozens
of citations that he makes.
I mean, it's uncountable.
So all of that literature that we don't have
that survived because some monk in the dark ages
wiped his buttocks with it.
You know?
Oh god.
Exactly.
They stopped preserving the good,
beautiful, amazing text
of the polytheistic world that's full of color
and three-dimensional,
and everyone has different ways of looking
at the world.
So there's one-dimensional dark, cold,
just no life.
It's just lacking life.
That's what it feels like.
And they're all writing about the same topics.
Oh, Maximistic Confessor wrote another
treatise on the Trinity.
Oh, how God and Father are one and the same.
And how dare you question that?
How dare you use your mind and think,
well, how can one person be the same as another one?
Then that's all you get.
You get non-stop treatises on the Trinity
for 500 years.
Great.
And Beowulf.
Imagine, Neil, imagine living in that society.
All you'd have to do is transport yourself back
for like two weeks and you'd be like,
no, no, I'm not going to do it.
I'm not absolutely not going to live in a world
where there's a church or a monist assembly
that controls everything around it.
And yeah, no.
And people say, oh, you can't say that about the church.
Yes.
You actually can historically look what happens.
And it all starts with Julian.
And he's the first one yelling and saying,
you cannot let the monists, and I use my word monists,
not my word, but the word,
you cannot let the Christians, he says.
You cannot let them take over.
Yeah, atheists.
Yeah, atheists.
No, but he's right though.
It's a different type of monism without the gods.
The Presocratic monism still has the gods.
You still have Zeus.
You still have Aphrodite.
There's just in this universe with us.
There's a whole different kind of monism going on.
Yeah.
Something inherently bad with creating a monist funnel cloud
that sucks all the civilization into its ruin.
Yeah, definitely.
Thank you for coming tonight, Neil.
I want to tell my audience before I sign off
that I am beginning my new classes next week,
Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday.
I've had such a demand for applications.
I've got way more applications than I can even think about covering.
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to keep people in the loop
by Sunday night making a little announcement
about what you can do to go forward with classes
for people who want to learn Greek.
I appreciate the fact that people are showing that much interest.
This is more demand than a dozen universities get in a year.
So gorgeous job.
Let's keep rocking it.
And I'm going to serve to the best of my capacity
to get everybody who wants to train,
trained and functional in the Greek.
Fantastic.
Thank you for coming tonight.
Neil, and I'll let you have the last word.
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan indeed.
Thanks for coming.
