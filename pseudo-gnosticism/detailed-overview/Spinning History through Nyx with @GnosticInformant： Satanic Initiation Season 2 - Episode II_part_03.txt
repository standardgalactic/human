It's just you're focusing
You're just setting your mind on something
As you're going through this
That's what we're describing
As a mania
Okay, yeah
Talk about it
Tell me about the mania
Tell me how that is effective
It's the mania
Going through the hymns
Reading the words
Focusing on them
Looking at the images
Looking at the statues
That the ancient Greeks made
The ones they found in Athens
The ones they found in Pompeii
Looking at these images
And trying to connect with the words
And the Greek
And trying to speak them out loud
This mania
It's the energy that comes from it
I know Sobek can identify with me right now
Because we talk about this
There's something and Ariel
Or even probably Snap
Probably a lot of people
I don't know who knows how many people look at
You know what I'm talking about
Something about this search
For the ancient world
Just searching for these texts
That's powerful
And something that
There's a magic from it
It's probably the same thing
That a lot of people who go into
Religious fundamentalism
Get at
But they falsely
Accredited to something that's not
Does that make sense?
Yeah, and does it
There's the context
As you're going through this process
And you're working the initiation
The same avenues that they were working
The same images
Do you find that it's
That it kind of fills you in
On context?
Like right now
You'll go back and you'll find something
That Jesus is like
I am the way
You'll know that he's talking about
The abstract thing
The way or with the mystic
The initiation
The initiation is the initiator
The initiation is the initiator
I am the way
There's one passage
That nobody can agree on
It's the most mysterious passage
He says
If thine eye be single
The whole body is filled with light
And everybody, all the scholars
And all the different Christian denominations
The Orthodox, the Catholics
They all have their own way of interpreting
With how this means
People think it's the third eye thing
But what is he saying?
If thine eye be single
The whole body is filled with light
I think he's talking about apotheosis
When he wants to say that he is one with God
He says that you can do the same thing
He's not saying that only he can do it
Believe in him
Or he's saying
I'm doing it
You can do it
Anyone can do it
He's going for the apotheosis
The attainment of the gnosis
That Paul talks about
The mystery of the knowledge
Which is exactly what I would expect to hear
From somebody who had been initiated
Into the mysteries of Heracles
That's exactly how I would expect them to talk
So do you see
Do you feel
That's what I thought about today
When he showed me that word
I thought I said that's my pharaohs
My head bringing the light
That sounds like
It sounds like that verse from the eye
Being single
Your eye being one
One eye
Bringing light
That's what that means
That's a Luciferian
That's a Luciferian passage all day long
Correct
Correct
And that eye or that ops
That gaze
That look
Is supposed to be
Gold
When it comes to
The medwa
Right
The kurya herself
The one who is the healer
Right
The one who is that sorceress
Whether it's kuryanukta
Or the kora
That kurya is the central figure
Of all the hymns
Of the orphic rite
Over and over for a reason
Right
There's a reason she comes at a lucis
There's a reason that she comes as isis
Right
We know that
We know that there's a
So
How did you feel
When you're in the middle of this
And you're looking at
You know
You want to be like Heracles
Right
You want to
You want to succeed
Nobody goes into the initiation
Want to be told
Ah
You know
Come back in a month
Right
And I
For everybody who's watching this
I gave Neil
