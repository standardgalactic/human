You suddenly have found out
You suddenly have found out
That the bad guy is the good guy
And the good guy is a crepe
And so now you understand
Why the whole entering into the morning
You were sending me then
I saw when you understood it
And you were like
Oh, the morning
It's morning
Exactly
That's why I turned the lights off
That's why it's dark here
Yeah
Nice
Nice
I'm surrounded by nicks right now
Do you
What did you write on your head?
I told you
I told you before we went live
I'm not having any lights on
The only light on me is my computer screen
And then I have the red lights behind me
That's it
All the lights are off
That's it
Could you show us your head?
Because I know you wrote some things on your head
Could you show us your head?
Oh, yes
Look at that
That
That is the son of Heracles, right?
That's the son of Heracles
Yeah, let me see
Okay
All right
I couldn't really see what I was doing in the mirror
So if it doesn't look right
Can you read it at least?
You understand
I can't read that one
Is that nicks?
Yeah, it's Greek
Yeah, I can't read it
Who?
Yeah, I can't
It's probably because the camera is reversing it
Yeah, I can tell
This is NYX
And then here's the Greek
Oh, I see
Oh, I see
Yeah, no, it's backwards
Look, you wrote it as if it were the reflection
That's fantastic
I didn't even realize that
I didn't even realize that
Mirror magic, bro
Now, wait a minute
Everybody who's watching
Why?
What is he doing?
He's putting the names of his God on his head
And if you remember
Not only did the bad guys do this
But the good guys do this too
The early Christians are talking about being branded
With the name of God
So, you know
Neal, physics here
What does it do when you put that name of that God on your head?
It's freedom
It's that freedom to be one with the power
With the demonic power
The demiurgic power over creation
The keys to victory
That's what that feeling is
Nothing like it
Yeah, you've been sitting
You can sit on that throne
And you can feel that kingdom power
Definitely love it
Being anointed by NYX
Yeah, nice
Now, last question that I have
And I'm not going
I can't make it to the
And I know people are going to want you to stay
So, I'm not rushing
Because I want you to answer a couple
If I can get two more questions, I'll be happy
But I can't go to the after meeting tonight
But I want to
I'm going to be getting in touch with those people
And I'm going to be doing short segments
Of your testimonies
Breaking out of Jehovah's Witnesses
I can't wait for that one
That one's going to be fantastic
Yeah, well, no
It's going to just be one testimonial
See, it's one thing to just be a regular dude
Who wants to join this
And get something from it
And that's fine
But it's a whole other thing
To leave the false religion
For the real religion
That's something
Whoever that is, I don't know who it is yet
He's not telling people
This is all private
I have no idea who it is
But whoever it is, I already know
You're in that mania right now
Feeling it
You're leaving the church
You're leaving that shackles behind you
You're starting a new thing
Nothing wrong with that
Awesome, I support it
I felt so
I don't know
I'm sure you felt this way before
And maybe I'm just feeling it for the first time
But I feel such an attachment
To what people were saying
Because people were coming forward
In the discord and saying, yeah, I was this
And I was there for so long
And it was like, well, what broke you out?
What got you out of your prison?
And it's over and over and over again
Neil, it looks like the audience has this
Consistently built into it
Is this just because we're...
Is this how the world is
That we've all been put into these cults
And now we, you know, it's time to try to build one
They don't have the options
That's what I'm saying
My mission in life before I die
Is at least start one
I want to have 100 around the country
But at least start one temple to Bacchus
Somewhere
Start, and then once that one gets put up
Someone else will see it and say
We're gonna start one in my city
And next thing you know, there might be a city
That has more temples of Bacchus
Than there is Catholic churches
