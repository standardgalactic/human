This is a pagan mystery
That's what I'm saying, at the Ophites
Were around to defend themselves, they would say
No, no, that's true
We were getting down with the mysteries
The Nazan preacher, I mean, come on
What does the Nazan preacher say?
He says, I call the Attis
The Assyrians call you Attis
The Egyptians call you Dionysus
I'm sorry, I gotta fix this
But it's okay, I can hear my voice anyway
The Thracians call you Adamus
All these different names
And he says, you know, the player of the pipes, Pan
The player of the flutes, Orpheus
He's naming all these names off from the mysteries
And he's identifying the Christ as that
So there's no doubt in my mind
That the Nazan preacher was doing this type of syncretism
There's no doubt in my mind he's part
And they're all into the mysteries
They're all into the mysteries
So you can't tell me that they weren't engaging in
The same things that were people in Aleutius were engaging in
And getting that mania going
That was the way to do it
That was the Orgiastic rights of Orpheus
The Orphic theology is what gives us Christianity
To begin with
Right, exactly
Okay, everybody heard that?
Not from me, from Neil
And I'm 100%
100%
Because he's talking about the evidence now
He's just talking about who they were
These people, what were they doing, right?
He's got nothing to grind
He's got no position to keep
He doesn't have anybody to impress and look good
He's just holding up the evidence
Neil, I'm going to
Oh, do we get you back?
Yeah
I'm going to go ahead and cut off
But I thought I would
Let you end it
Let you end it
With something that you wanted to say
About the value
About the value of getting those images
Right, of digging in
Just tell me
You're going to report back to the dojo next week
For Greek
And when I give you Greek assignments
And I'm yelling at you to get them done
You'll understand, I'm doing it now
To get you to have those eyes
You've begun to see those texts
Now, what do you anticipate
From this point out?
You realize you can do everything now, right?
If you perfect this art and this skill
Now you can act as that intermediary
You don't need me
And that's why I enjoy doing this
Is because it's me teaching you a skill
I thought it was the perfect thing to say to people
It doesn't even have to be Greek
Even though that's where I would go
Because I think the Greeks have
I think they are the brilliant minds of our world
But learn Sanskrit
Learn Coptic
Learn Latin
And then go back and re-translate some of these texts
For yourself
And that is where the magic happens
When you do the work
When you get that gnosis
It's not about just believing what the text says
And just believing that
Some guy translated it for you correctly
And you're just going to watch a YouTube video
Go in and get the gnosis
Get that divine knowledge
Learn the languages
Go back, translate it for yourself
And I'm doing John
I'm looking at John
And I'm finding out right in the beginning of John
Not only is there the Lagos
Which is a concept that means nothing
Way more than just the word
That's not what it means
But not even just that
That's kindergarten stuff
The next passage, verse 3
Talks about the life of Zoe
Did you know that Zoe is in John?
No
I just found that out from going to the Greek
You wouldn't know that from the English
But Zoe is in there
So the Lagos is Zoe
I even had to ask Litwes
Is the Lagos a female?
He said some people do think that
He said that's good translation
No, that's not in the English
But I found that
I found that from my own translation
The Lagos is life
Zoe is a female word
Because it ends with that
Excellent
You heard it from the Gnostic informant
Get off yourself
And move over a cushion
And get a program
That'll help you learn
Coptic or whatever
Look, we're sitting in that museum
We're sitting in that museum
Anybody who doesn't get up and do this
Thank you
Gnostic informant
It is an honor, sir
To be, to serve with someone
Who has obtained a secret name
Yes, Hale Satan
Hale Satan
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
