Sunday morning, dark clouds rising Oh, there's no sunshine anywhere
Strong winds blowing, God give us wisdom To grasp the message in the air
Oh, if I could have one wish And know that it would come true
Had a wish that God would give us strength To know just what to do
Then we could tear down the fences That fences all in
Fences created by such evil men Then we could tear down the fences
That fences all in Maybe we could walk together again
Welcome back to Satanic Initiation, Lady Babylon.
It's nice to have you again.
What I've got tonight is a little bit of a treat.
We're going to bring Peter.
Peter who? St. Peter.
We're going to bring St. Peter in and we're going to interrogate him.
And in the process, we're going to find out who he is, what his job was,
and how he was involved with Jesus tonight on Lady Babylon.
So tonight we're going to look at the Hamartalos.
And what we're going to do is we're going to see who this person is.
Really, it's an exercise in classical philology tonight, guys.
And before everybody gets bored and starts to walk out,
because that's classical philology, just the sound of it.
Isn't it sound boring? It sounds boring.
But it's not. It's really not.
And what we're going to do tonight as investigators is we're going to look at a word.
We're going to look at a word.
We're going to track that word.
It's the word that Peter used of himself, of himself.
Before we purify the temple tonight, the sacred space that we have,
I want to show you quickly about the ages of the children who are the apostles.
Yes, the students of Jesus and their age.
People love to run in and they love to say,
Oh, but Peter, Peter was married.
Peter was married.
If you hear that from a biblical scholar or a religious historian,
you will want to question them.
Say, what's the evidence that we have for that?
