right but for those who teach the bible the the ones that really should be taking their place
are the scholars and i'm not talking about the people at harvard i'm talking about the people
who spent time in their lives saying there is this thing called language and you know what
i'm going to master to the best of my ability this one so i can access those sources i'm not
here to sell you anything have you seen me hawk you any t-shirts or hats i don't want that
i'm not here to give you a church you know that nobody here wants that i'm here to bring you those
texts and to show you that you too can learn and master and open up that gateway to reality
that is the past all we have to do is bring these texts to the world the whole world should see
jesus for who he is and he was a man arrested in a park with a naked boy for a reason for a reason
it's all about that museum we have to maintain the integrity of the museum um i've got a couple
more but i think i'm just gonna hit this last one yep i'm taking up people's time um yeah
no no no this is just when jesus boatjacks peter i'm sorry peter remember um
peter james and john were on these boats and see a galley right on the shore to see a galley
and their parents go away to mend the nets and when jesus sees the parents leave he goes over
to the boat that's got peter on it and he says hey take us up to the shoreline and i'll teach
these people on the shore and they do and when they're done teaching jesus turns back to peter
and he says hey peter let's go out into the deep end let's go let's go see what's going on over
there and it's at that point after the miracles have taken place that peter collapses falls down
it says i am not worthy he says you know what i am you know what i am jesus and this must have been
so hard for peter this must have been so hard because remember the stigma that is attached
to the act of sodomy and antiquity remember the stigma and peter has to acknowledge
before jesus that he is in an operation that he is in the middle of ancient prostitution
and does jesus have a problem with it nope as a matter of fact he goes and gets himself
a telonis to help collect the fees his name was matthew you guys have a good night i'm
gonna go now to lady babelon in about 20 minutes and i'm gonna throw out some discussion i'm just
gonna throw out some things that i want to discuss that i want everybody to discuss not me
