The drugs inevitably get spoiled.
These are very precise formulae with upwards of 50 to 70 ingredients.
They're compounds.
Very complex with measurements, specific measurements.
Right.
Plenty.
Plenty says it's ridiculous how small the measurements of these things get.
Right.
Oh my goodness.
So you got to be careful, man.
You got to be careful.
And so that's what we've got.
Hit us with the, Galen says, bring that last one back up again.
Galen says, look, Galen says, look, you know, yeah, yeah, yeah.
And what happens?
They adulterate or they destroy whatever the, they put something else in there and cause
a problem.
Right.
And you can't get it.
He said, there's only certain people who are in the know.
He uses a participle who were in the know.
Good.
Go to the next one.
And by the way, he says they do it just so they can sell drugs to make money.
Oh, sell drugs to me.
Does that sound familiar to you?
Does that sound like something that, well, that's the air that is in Rome.
Second century.
Okay.
But, you know, look, we're not here for that.
We're here to see this cult stuff.
Right.
We're here.
Okay.
Great.
Augustus, Marcus, Raelius, Nero, all on drugs.
All have their own formula.
You know, Augustus had his own formula.
I'm going to show it to you at the end.
Right.
Oh, and the toxicon.
It's the arrow poison people were back there with you guys all know that we've been here.
Look, we've been with these cult junkies.
You give me something new.
Amen.
Okay.
Give me the next one.
Here we go.
Look at this.
Oh, there's a one liner, right?
So, yeah, what do we understand about drugs?
Well, we know this Theriac has an amazing capacity of an advantage for the body.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And it can be taken every day.
Every day.
Oh, really?
Is that what Marcus Raelius is into?
Let's see.
Let's see.
We can close.
We can close.
Oh, God.
Go, go, go, go.
So the divine Marcus.
Look what he calls him.
He calls him the divine Marcus Raelius.
That, you know, most of us are not so lucky as to be declared divine while alive.
Right.
Now in Rome, yeah.
Emperor dies.
Boom.
Immortality.
Right.
What do you think Heracles did?
Why do you think they burned Heracles' life?
Did anybody notice that?
Right.
Why didn't they show that on Disney?
They should have shown that.
Oh, with his flesh coming off.
Right.
The poison drizzling down onto his skin.
Yeah.
Screaming his head off.
That would have been the way to go.
I think Mel Gibson might want to do something like that.
We get him to do a good Heracles.
Yeah.
Get the next one.
Yeah.
People, look at this.
What do you use the theriac for?
What do you use it for?
Right.
Again, what is the theriac?
It's this multi-combo drug.
Right.
A whole bunch of ingredients that you're using.
Daily.
Yeah.
And what does it do?
It nourishes you.
It nourishes you.
Yeah.
Kind of in a magical kind of way.
Kind of like Ambrosia.
Ambrosia.
You come out on the other side looking better than you do now.
Okay.
Now I'm talking directly to my audience.
Everybody.
Everybody's got a congregation and anybody who wandered in is like, oh, God, let me out.
When you enter at this level, yeah, you're finding something that is buried in quantum
space.
There's something in the universe that's about to come out and reveal itself and you're going
to poop in your pants.
Give me that.
Give me that next one.
Right.
Nope.
Don't defecate.
Chewy, don't let them defecate in the ship, please.
Yes.
Please report here with a mop.
Yeah.
What are we talking about when we're talking about the drugs?
I just wanted you to see that Galen is very precise about, you know, each of the drugs has
an activity or activities, things that add up to its gospel of salvation.
Do you understand?
The name of Rome, keep thinking about it, comes together.
Yeah.
So we've got the gospel, right?
We've got the power and how things work in Edigea, right?
All of that Galen is considering and he's like, how do we test this stuff?
Right?
Well, you know, if you're in the right position, you use a person who's been condemned to death,
right?
And then you get that person and, you know, you take your venom and you use your venom
and then you give them the antidote.
Yeah.
And, you know, if it doesn't work, no harm done.
Yeah.
Right?
Because you're still following justice.
Yeah.
How else are you going to write?
Remember, Cersei, do you think she cared?
Right?
No.
You guys, they've got it to a science now with these Theriac drugs.
They're balancers.
They're antidotes for some of the formulae on the other hand of the equation.
And this is what nobody sees in Galen's work.
There's a formula that you and I have looked at, say, Tenet Congregation, and you know it's
to Nero.
And you know that in that is the Dark Harbor and the Palma Medes, the Potion of Medea,
the Communion, the drug, the Black Death.
That formula, I'm giving you this tonight because you can't sell something that's so
precious.
The formula is mirrored.
The formula for the Black Death is mirrored next to the Theriac genius of the way that
Andromachus wrote it.
And a little bit heady, if you ask me.
Yeah, a little bit heady.
He's showing off.
He's showing off for his buddy Nero.
All right.
All right.
Let's keep going.
