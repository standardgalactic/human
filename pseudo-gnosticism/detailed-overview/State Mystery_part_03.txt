Back to the text.
Oh, my mind.
Do you think they have her name yet?
No, I don't think they do.
All right.
Yeah.
So you can establish the integrity of the usefulness of that antidote, right?
And we can do this.
This is where he says we can do this.
If we, you know, we take criminals, right?
And we can do that.
Or we can do what you and I do is not people with authority.
Oh, goodness.
I spilled all over Joey.
Get his fire extinguisher.
No, we don't need a fire extinguisher.
Just okay.
Just leave it right there.
We need to establish with authority that this man just spilled tea all over Hell's Kitchen.
No, I'll bring that text back up and let's just keep working.
If we short out, that's too bad.
Yeah.
So this is too important.
Look at this.
It's those who have the knowledge of how these things work, right?
Those are the people who can provide us with the proper curatives and how to mix and how to make.
They're the ones that can do that.
But of course they are the ones who have those ears to hear, right?
Those who know, he says it's those who know.
Give me the next text.
Next text.
Boom.
Let's blow that up.
Oh, fantastic.
And what happens?
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
We all know that the greater part of kingship, right?
Is that common salvation that we are all looking for?
Is everybody looking for salvation?
It's not just the Christians, right?
Who want and need salvation.
It is the pagan world before the Christian world.
They gave the Christian world that drive.
Isn't that nice?
Look, it's all backwards.
There's a bunch of druggies.
The gospel is actually a drug mechanism.
Isn't that nice?
It's like the, it's every evolutionary biologist's wet dream, right?
I feel everything is wet in here, right?
It's amazing.
It feels like we're in a cave.
Did we, did we just reproduce the cave of the nymphs?
I think Pythagoras, that dirty creep is around here somewhere.
You know what that was?
I think that was the ghost of Pythagoras that just spilled my tea.
It's disgraceful.
Go to the next one.
Love it.
You needed some relief, didn't you?
Sometimes it's too serious.
Is that the next one?
Yep.
No.
That's the next one after that.
Good.
Chewie, excellent.
And oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Oh, this is for, okay.
This one is just to smash paradigms.
Yeah.
Just to take a, take a sledgehammer to the folks who think they know everything.
Now, remember Dr. Pagels will tell you that women in antiquity, you like that huge general
statement, like, you know, they're all one thing.
Women in antiquity didn't do anything, but stayed inside the house and did their domestic
chores.
And first of all, it just sounds funny on the surface, doesn't it?
You know, it's like, that sounds like something somebody made up who maybe didn't know so much.
Yeah.
No, it's weird.
So dedicated to those who say such foolish things and don't know.
Here's a little, just a little evidence from Galen.
Look, follow up that Galen.
Yeah.
Look at the top here.
Look at the name that's on the first line.
It's the sixth word in, right?
Right?
Who is this?
Oh, who is she?
What does it say about her?
Oh, it says everybody talked her up.
Every talked her up.
She had a reputation, if you know what I mean.
Yep.
Yep.
Yep.
What'd they talk her up for?
What'd they talk her up for?
Make it big.
They talked her up because of what?
Because she was a better philosopher than anybody around by far.
And she had a knowledge of Plato that nobody else had had.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm waiting a minute.
Women don't get educated.
They stay inside.
Bull.
Yes.
Your image.
Hey.
Hey, Pagels.
Dr. Pagels.
Your understanding of the past does not reflect the evidence.
So I'm sorry.
Lucifer wants his money back.
Give me the next one.
Oh, did you feel that?
I was a little bit of an aura.
Did you feel that?
And everybody's like, ooh, did people feel that aura?
It went out.
It went out from us.
Oh, I'm going to give you one more and then I'm going to purify again.
Are you ready?
Oh, God.
Yeah.
There's all sorts.
There's all sorts.
Look, these things differ.
I brought you this because I wanted you to see that the powers of these drugs differ
and their uses are complex.
Galen is just, he's basically saying, look, this is the foundation of medicine.
He goes back and he quotes Hippocrates directly.
And he says, look, this whole drug thing, this is the bomb.
This is what makes everything work.
This is the energy of the frigging cosmos.
Now, do you know why the mystery is coming from this group?
All right.
Listen to the science that's behind it.
All right.
Listen.
Wonderful.
Bring it up.
And next, look here, people.
Look at Christ.
I thought, you know what?
We've been saying Christ here and Christ there so much.
Let's just bring the Christ in.
And look, here we are with the Christ.
And notice in parentheses gang, Greek gang that it's from Rio.
And that's great.
We all want that.
We all know what that means.
And it's old as for it means to be stung by the gadfly.
We all know that.
Wait.
What does it mean to be robbed in used as an ointment?
And who?
Who is it that it quotes?
Quotes Askelos.
When Askelos is writing about Prometheus.
Yeah.
The savior.
Oh my goodness.
You know, who's eating his liver?
This is the thing you knuckleheads always leave out.
And you know who I am if I'm addressing you.
