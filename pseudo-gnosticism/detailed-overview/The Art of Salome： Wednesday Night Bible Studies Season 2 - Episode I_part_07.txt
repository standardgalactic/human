And when you think about it, that's phenomenal.
It's not even in our brains to be able to say,
I couldn't take, if I was a musician,

It's terrible.
So how does he, how does he go back?

and I'm going to bring you some more information.
But yeah, he was, he went to Ireland thinking
there was an apocalypse about dragon.
He actually just, he made it all the way to Ireland
with no money whatsoever.
