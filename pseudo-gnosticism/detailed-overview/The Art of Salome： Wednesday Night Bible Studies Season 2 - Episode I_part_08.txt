because he didn't speak Gaelic, he didn't speak English
and they didn't speak French.
So he really struggled.
So what I'd like to do is offer more information
as to why he went there and what happened to him
when he came back.
So I don't want to go too early on that.
I'd like to give a more detailed account
and I'm really going to research on that.
Good, and you're going to be talking to us
a little bit about his magic too
and some things you found out
and he was trying to protect someone.
Right.
Yes, I've got to make amends there
because I have presented a spell
on the last Bible studies.
I presented a spell that I interpreted as a death threat
and I've recently got more information on that
and it's not a death threat.
What it is is a protection spell
and I'm trying to piece together
and figure out the metaphoric basis of how you say to somebody
I'll send you the force of death in a protection manner
and somebody commented on YouTube,
somebody commented after and said
I don't think it's a death threat
and that made me second guess myself
which is a good thing.
I enjoy second guessing.
I don't mind being mistaken and wrong
and I'll certainly address anything like that such as...
another one.
I'm not very good at this, am I?
Because it is Mary Beard as far as I can tell
but the English accent would be different on that
but then, yeah, it's not a death threat
what is sent in this poor Sophie Amasse
was, I think she was Jewish
and I think she was taken off in occupied France,
German occupied France
and she was taken off which, like I say,
I'd prefer to offer a bit more detail
