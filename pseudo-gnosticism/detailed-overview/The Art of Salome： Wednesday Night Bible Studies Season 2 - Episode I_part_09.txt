than I've got right now.
Isn't it nice to have an extremely well-read audience?
I mean, this is like being in the museum.
Here, we can get excellent comments
and we have people say, hey, have you seen this?
They'll pull something off the shelf.
They'll be like, look at this manuscript.
Oh, it's got dires formula and stuff like that from antiquity.
We have a real opportunity here with...
you're not an audience, right?
You're not an audience.
You're active participants now in the initiation
and I appreciate that.
I appreciate that and Rob appreciates that.
Rob will be talking about our toe in the future
when it's appropriate.
For Friday night, for Friday night,
I want us to be able to see the initiation in progress.
This is the goal if we can reach that Herculean
unassailable freedom.
I'm looking forward to Friday night.
Yeah, me too.
Thank you, everybody.
Thank you, Rob, and we'll see everybody Friday night.
I want to tell you guys, and I can tell Rob is thinking
the same thing.
It's a real honor to have a great group of participants
like you guys who consistently hang here with us.
Yeah, and we need to start bringing everybody on board.
We need to start making this a more hospitable congregation.
But anyway, I'm going to stop blabbing, Rob.
Thank you very much.
Thanks for having me on and I'll see you next time.
Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
Show me the girl I never met.
I want it so bad.
Where is that golden palace?
Where is that horse called destiny?
I think she ran off without me.
