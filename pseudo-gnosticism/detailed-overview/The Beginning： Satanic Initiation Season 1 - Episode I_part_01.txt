Everybody's in.
We're good.
We've got a document because we're necromancers.
We're going to use human thought as our wave.
We've got a document from antiquity that we can say a few things about its date.
We know that it's preserved by one of the early imperial physicians.
Yeah.
And we know that it's a addressed to Nero in a funny kind of way.
It puts Nero in the place of the divinity that you are imprecating.
Yeah.
Now who's going to know this?
Nobody.
Nobody is going to know this.
You can take the documents that I show you.
You can take them to a classicist.
You can force them to read them to you.
Yeah.
But nobody studies this.
Nobody.
Why am I studying this?
And why am I bringing it to you?
Because the muse told me to.
And because she very intelligently led me right into this pathway.
Ancient pharmacology.
Oh, we have this great text.
So we have this great text.
Go ahead and bring up.
It's number three there.
Bring that up on you.
Yes.
Oh, and look, what is this thing?
Can I just tell you what this thing is?
Here we go.
We're almost there.
The world has almost changed.
Let's give it one more.
30 second interval.
It's repeating cycles.
Anyway, look at this people.
Look at this.
Bring up the score here.
Oh my God.
Andromahoo.
Theriacay.
Dia ehidnon.
Oh my God.
Hey.
Colomene canene.
Oh my God.
You know what that is?
This is the Theriac.
This is the beast.
Theriac is the beast.
Look at it.
You grubby little.
You're so.
You love it.
You got the beast right up front, right in your face.
This is the beast.
It's called the Theriac.
Does anybody know what a Theriac is?
Nobody knows yet what a Theriac is or they're not fast enough to type.
So what is it?
It's the word for serpent or beast or a wild dangerous thing.
We've translated it with the word beast in English,
but a Theriac is a multi component formula that's used in religious
rights.
And on the medical side,
what you and I would call straight up medicine,
but they're not.
They're not distinguishing between medicine and religion.
Right.
So when, for example,
when you're giving a woman,
bringing a woman to the point of birthing,
that's a ritual.
Right.
They're singing involved in that.
You know, we don't.
We don't feel that way.
We don't feel that way.
We don't feel that way,
but they did.
So you should understand that.
This is what how culture transmits that spark is known as called it.
You know, beautiful, beautiful.
Okay.
So our time machine has come to rest and here we are.
We're stepping out.
We're going to start in the first century with Nero because we know this thing.
Go ahead and put it up again.
We know this thing is written to Caesar.
