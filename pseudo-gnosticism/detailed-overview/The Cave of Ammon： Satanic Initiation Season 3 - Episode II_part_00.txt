I never meant anything I said, just spittin' it up
Everything I've been fittin'
Keepin' from eatin' away at me
Never said anything I meant
I never said the letters that I should've said
But so it's askin' too much for you all to believe
When I say, never meant nobody no harm
When I say, never was the cost of a long
Never knew what I was talkin' about anyway
Hello and welcome back, welcome back
It's nice to see everyone
We have a great, great, great topic to delve into tonight
And a place to go
And I'm very happy to say that at the end of our time together tonight
Our 30 minutes, we'll have four very well-known guests
Who will give us an announcement
Yes, we have a great announcement to give tonight
Fantastic, I can't wait
Those of us who value honor will feel the shame of our ancestors
Yeah, this should prove to be an outstanding time
We're gonna start off
We're gonna start off with...
Oh, excuse me
We're gonna start off...
I'm sorry, a little direction problem
Don't worry, Chewie, I'll tell you when
We're gonna start off today
Though with our section on the Cave of Amon
And we're going to take now the next step down
In our descent into the Chthonian realm
Again, we're gonna do it by bringing the future and the past together and present
Fantastic, we'll begin with a look at Anastasia
And so I wanna run a couple of...
Just a couple of clips
Say a couple of things
And hone kind of focus where we're looking here
Remember, we're searching for Lady Babylon
And under the right circumstances, everything can come together
So tonight I wanna start off with a couple of clips that we've put together here
From Neil's interview with Anastasia
And I want us to look at just responses
I just wanna see what are responses
As if we're just having tea saying what is this situation
And who is this person?
Let's run the first one
I'm like a volunteer obviously
But I talk with soldiers quite a bit
And it has not diminished
People are very hyped and still willing to do what is necessary to do
And people always say we didn't choose the war obviously
But it's here, so what else can you do other than defend what you love
And what we love is Ukraine and our people
So people from the West say we should stop this war
We should go for peace agreements
Because we care about Ukrainian people
And yet no, you don't
If you cared about Ukrainian people, you would listen to what Ukrainian people want
And what we want by every estimation, by every poll in existence
Is to continue fighting no matter what
And to return our people back home
And what Russians are doing to those people there is atrocious
And in ways I cannot even describe to you
Every liberated city has had mass graves
Tortures, rapes, slaughter of civilians on insane scale
And this is the weight for us to liberate them
So this is not negotiable
We are not giving up those people to Russia
And to this nothingness basically is what expects them if we give up on them
So what we've got is some more of the shenanigans
And now the criminal courts have declared that
Hey look, Vlad Putin is taking children
Look at the irony, if you cannot taste the irony of this
Vlad is abducting children like a pirate
Yeah, and he's forcing them, putting them in camps
Forcing them to speak Russian
No more Ukrainian
No more Ukrainian, you'll speak Russian
Look at the irony here about the Russian people
No more Ukrainian, you'll speak Russian
Look at the irony here about those who support Putin
This is a strong woman
People talk about a strong woman in the States
This is a strong woman
She was involved in the 2014 revolution
And when I get a chance to interview her
I've been waiting
Apparently, Kharkiv was hit by
Gifted with hypersonic missiles and drones
And all sorts of things to keep them in the dark
So as soon as we can, I will get an interview for her
She's agreed to do it
And I'm going to ask her
I'm going to ask her about the nitty-gritty
Let her speak
Chewie, hit her again
With the western support we are having right now
We have every chance to win it
And we intend to
We intend to do that
And I hope we will
Continue, please do if you can
To support maybe Ukrainian volunteers
I have PayPal as well, by the way
On my Twitter, which you can help out
And see what I'm doing on Twitter
I post pretty much everything I'm doing
And yeah
So assist organizations that help Ukraine
Such as Come Back Alive, for example
Which is a pretty good fund to help Ukraine
Or maybe help volunteers like me, for example
And people who are doing projects
Of helping our army in every way we can
And also talk with people about it
Is also very important
To fight against some narratives
That Russia propaganda continues to spew
And those who support Russia in the west as well
So do try to fight them back
And to spread the word
So bringing this message
Just how difficult is it for us
Just to bring, we have the technology now
We can bring her message out
Right, and we can show the world
Right, we can be those people
Who put that statue of the virgin on the hill
And said freedom, that's what it's about
That's what it's about, one more time
So they already did some moves
Like they did in 2014 to achieve that
