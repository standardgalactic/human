And it brings us to Cersei
And Cersei, the daughter of Helius
Hyperion's son, loves steadfast
Odysseus and Borogreus and Latinus
Oh, wait a minute, what?
Latinus?
That has the word Latin in it
Who is faultless and strong
Also, she brought forth
Telaganus
By the will of Golden
Aphrodite, why Golden Aphrodite?
That's a cult title, that's the
Aphrodite who's involved in the production
Right?
And they ruled over the famous Thracians
Nice, next
Next
You see the cult is really
What's pushing and driving everything
And this is the area
You see the Libyans in the south
We have Carthage there
We have Sicily
Where Diodorus happens to be from
And the Terenian
Power here
This is a Pulascian
Power, this is an early power
In the cult, go ahead
Oh, it's gorgeous
Next, please
What are these people?
They're called Tocthon
They're of the Cthon
You don't call their Zeus
A Zeus
You call them a Cthonian
Zeus
Yeah, a Cthonian
Zeus
Yeah, nice that
Cth
Guess what?
Yeah, guess what? It's so beautiful
The language so, it's just like
Amber, it just traps that
It's just a bit of the past
And just kind of keeps it
Preserved for all time
Can never take this stuff away
Next, please
Yeah, Pulascian and Arian Medea
So, let's just look
Next slide
The first Dionysus was the son of
Amun
Yep
And look at this
Little tidbit, right?
Some Georgian scholars
Connect the Pulascians
With the Ibero-Caucasian peoples
Of the prehistoric Caucasus
Now, into the Greeks
As Calkians
Right?
We're going right back
To the Garden
We're going right back
To Edom
Where those four rivers meet
And you're saying, wait a minute
I'm doing this, but I'm doing it
In a way that comes through
The Late Bronze Age
But I know that this is actually
3,000 years previously
Yeah
3,000 to 5,000
Oh my goodness, yes, that's where we are
We're seeing the focus
Come through
That
Medua
Yeah, please
To blow it
To bring the end
Of our
Search
To its culmination, right?
Here we are in the cave
And we've been looking
For that source, for that origin
You thought
You thought that
Adam was a Hebrew name
It is not
It is not
Neither is Eve
And you say, how can you say that?
It's contrary to the last
2,000 years of
Uh-huh
Yes, it is
But it's a fact, let me show you
Chewy, hit him with a chart
This is going to blow your mind
Look at this, look at the linear B
We have the Latin, that's nice
And then we have the Greek
Isn't this gorgeous?
Who is this guy?
Who is the Adamwe?
Right, who is the
Who is the Adamwe?
Who is that
Adam?
So when the
Civilian oracles stand up
And they tell you that Adam
Is Greek
And it was based upon a religious practice
Each of the characters
In his name
Represent the action
Of quartering
Of quartering, if you know
Adam, you can quarter
Right?
It's north, south, east and west
