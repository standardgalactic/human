Drankin' whiskey, when that whiskey's burned to my veins
Indie indos crazy and the Scottsman wants to bash out the brain
All that English rhyme, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see, you've gotcha sellin' and you got your drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah, drinkin' whiskey
Oh yeah
Welcome back to the Lady Babylon
As you may have noticed tonight, I'm dressed for my date
My date with a Hidna
Now, we're gonna bring Paul along for the sake of entertainment
But for those of you with weak stomachs, you gotta watch out
Paul's one of those types
We're gonna find him, we're gonna bring him here and we're gonna make that junkie
Answer for himself tonight on Lady Babylon Wednesday night Bible study
I am indeed, and that's for a good reason, you always want to dress to impress, right?
We are going on our journey tonight starting with some comments
I wanna just flash up a couple of comments here just so that we've got some feedback from you
I want you to know, maintaining these connections
Let's bring up our first one, Chewie
This is fantastic, people thank, this is from Stella Luna
I'm just gonna call her Stella Luna
People thank any group of like-minded individuals
Getting together is a cult nowadays
I've noticed some crazy comments on YouTube and I've even seen some crop-up in the lives
I've been watching all the previous streams and I'm pretty much caught up at this point
I'd also like to re-watch because there is so much material and a lot of it is over my head
Like when people comment about almond getting political
And telling him to stay in his lane
That really pisses me off
Everything is political, especially now
The Christ of Fascists are in hyperdrive
And you'd have to be totally asleep at the wheel not to see it
Wow, Christ of Fascists
Christ of Fascists, love that Stella Luna
What a beautiful light you've shown in tonight
That's gorgeous, what a gorgeous comment
For every one of those I just...
I love it, it just fills me with hope
Yeah, fills me with hope, love it
Thank you so much, thank you so much
Let's get it, can we get a negative comment?
No, we didn't have any negative, Chewie says
Necessity is the mother, so invention creation is predetermined
So are we not the children of chaos?
Indeed, we're the sons and daughters and hermaphroditic offspring of the work
Question mark, are we?
Are we?
Look at that
Look at what thought is blazing
This is fantastic, you people are fantastic
I love these, I love these, let's go to one more
Mmm, mmm, mmm, what's that song at the beginning?
Yes, and tonight we'll introduce for your listening pleasure
Zane Campbell, Zane Campbell
This is the man who would save country music
You're talking about royalty
You're talking about country royalty
In the kingdom of the musicians
Yeah, fantastic, and he has been generous enough as you guys have noticed
To let us use him for our intros and our outros
And for any sort of video that we might make
And, I'll have you know, Zane is a monster
He is a monster
And right now, Zane Campbell, for your sakes
For your sakes
Zane Campbell
I'm told
Is considering writing a song for us
A song just for us, just for this channel
And that song, I'm told, will have something to do
With Jesus and a naked boy
Jesus and a naked boy
This is gorgeous, this is gorgeous
So, where can you get in touch with Zane?
Chewie is listed a couple of places
And, uh,
Hang on one second, I want to tell you the
Description Spotify and Bandcamp?
Yeah, okay, fantastic, go to those
Go to those
And look up Zane Campbell
Love him, love him, absolutely love him
Thank you, Zane, for the use of the music to set the ambiance
We love that, people like especially Drinking Whiskey
He seemed to have hit a nerve there, my buddy, from the underworld
This guy's a monster
Love him, okay, let us go, let us go
Right away, let's get on that train
We're about to head out and we set the time machine
We're going, we're going to make a couple of stops
