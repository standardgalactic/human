Come here, you druggy
Did you guys know Saint Paul was a druggy?
Did you know he was one of the biggest druggies in the whole book?
Yes, he's out there
John gave him a run for his money
John gave him a run for his money, right?
That's not his middle finger, is it?
Was that his middle finger?
Oh, wow, okay, I told him take it easy, right?
Take it easy
This is the guy, Paul, let's just do it, people
Let's just do it
Look, good cop's gone
Paul, show me your arm
Where did you get those two puncture wounds?
Ah, it was a...
You say it was some kind of viper, the bitcha
And, yeah, like, yeah, really?
No problems? Yeah, no problems
You got no problems with that, huh?
You just walked it off, you just shook it off, literally
Wow, okay, fantastic, Paul
Fantastic, that does it
Now, tell us, Paul, what you been shooting up?
What you been shooting up?
Because you've been saying some of the craziest stuff going
We've got it here, look
Look, here it is, Paul
Can you see? Can you see it's all recorded in this book?
We got your letters, we got your letters
Bring up that letter
Okay, state's evidence, bring it up
Yep
Next, there we go
Paul, you're recorded as writing this
Pheos under whose power
You project this mystery
You proclaim that it's under the authority
Of that resurrection from the dead
Is that correct?
Is that the right that we're talking about, Paul?
Resurrection from the dead?
Yeah, you know it is, shut up
Yeah, let's keep going
We got more, Paul, we got more
A couple of things you said here, I just want you to...
Yeah, go ahead, just keep going straight down
Yep, yep, there we go
You were also reportedly
Telling people that this Gnostic thing
Has been brought out of the invisible
Out of the invisible cosmos
Into the visible world
Is that right, Paul?
Is that right?
You got something coming down the pipe force
So what is associated with the Ophites?
Here you're seeing, right?
Associations, vocabulary
He's using vocabulary that the Ophites are using
You know what those Ophites are doing?
Those serpents, guess what they're doing
With that hot purple
Yeah, with that hot purple
They are writing vapors
That take them to places that you can't go
You can't go, tell us, Paul
Tell us about writing those vapors, you junkie
Bring it up, bring it up, let's get him
Let's get him, we got another source
We got another source up here
Next one, oh my goodness, yay, okay
Here you are, buddy, you know you said this
Right, you're going to be talking about those visions
Those visions and those apocalypses
Those things that are reviewed
That are brought, renewed back into your vision
And those things are coming from Curios, aren't they?
Yeah, they are
Tell us, Paul, do you know anybody, Paul?
Now I'm going to quote him to you directly
I know a man, I know a man in Christ
14 years now
Whether this dude in body, I don't know
Or out of body, I don't know
Does this, only God knows
Really, and tell us, what do you go through
When you're under the juice, what do you go through?
Bring it back up
This dude gets grabbed and pulled off to what?
The third uranos
