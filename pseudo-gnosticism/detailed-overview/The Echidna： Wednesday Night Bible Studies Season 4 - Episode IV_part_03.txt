Now, those of you who are going to step back
You have been mesmerized by the Maseratic tradition
And the King James, ho, ho, ho, ho
Yes, King James
King
Look what you did
Look what you did to these people
Look what you did
They're going to try to inject something here
That's not from the original
This is uranos we're talking about
Paul is being kicked up to uranos
Now notice here
At this point in the interrogation
That we're about to play
Paul gets nervous
Almost as if he's a little bit
You know how they are when they come off it?
Yeah, when they come off it
They're all like, forgetful
You know what I mean?
Their eyes roll
They do that thing where they're looking up
These bakans, right?
We know who they are
Let's keep going
Bring back that same giant testimony that he's got there, Chewie
Last big Greek text
Look at this, people
Weather and body are mine
Outside of body, I don't know
But this guy was snatched up to the third uranos
And I know this man
Weather and body
Yeah, we're out of body
I don't know
But he was snatched into paradise
And he heard the areta remata
Which is not right for men to say
Pull out
He heard the what, you junkie
He heard the what, you guys saw it
Last time we were here, we were in the Mithraic Rite
And you saw it, they saw it
Kidna, they saw it, right?
You were in the Rite
And you realize the vision
You've made what is invisible visible
Fantastic, fantastic
And what is the specific experience that you've experienced?
So for those of you who've been detained by the hippies
For those of you who've been sidetracked
By those who lack discipline
Yeah, we're not talking about love and having a good time
We aren't, yeah
We're talking about hearing that which is not repeatable
Yeah, the good stuff
The remata
What are remata, you say?
What are remata?
Remata are what the purple gives us, baby
Oracles
You want to sit here and have dinner with me tonight?
Kidna?
I'm going to have to have an oracle
I'm going to have to have it because having you here
Without fulfilling your purpose
Would be the greatest crime of history
I want you to sing
Yeah
How is Paul?
We got one more question for this guy
Right?
Big one
How are you getting it, buddy?
How are you getting access to the kingdom of Satan?
How are you getting it?
Who has given you the salvation that is kicking you up
To the third uranos
Which we all know is the place that your daddy
That's your daddy
Your holy daddy, Paul
We know it's your holy daddy who's behind it all
You kicked up to that place
How are we going to get there, Paul?
Tell us, bring back the text one more time
He'll tell us
Squeeze him
Love him
I love to squeeze him
Look at that last line
