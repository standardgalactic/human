If you look at her from the waist down
She has that sheen
That those scales get
When they give off that reflected light
And it's prism
They have that sheen
That's what her skin is like
Isn't that nice?
But keep going on our description
Let's see what else
What would you like for dinner?
Ehidna
What would you like for dinner?
This is she who starts the mystery
I need you to understand that
She is
Omestin
Zathes
She is
The flesh eater
For those of you who didn't know
You were an abacchic rebel
Now you do
Now you do
Yeah, okay
She's the one we saw her
Right?
She's the one
She is, she's approaching
And now we know
That we have this junky St. Paul
AKA St. Paul
We know that we have an avenue
To get to that iraculous place
Yeah, this is fantastic
We're closing in
As you can see, Jesus' operation
In Toto
Yes
Its sophistication
Is, I know, trans-dimensionally alarming
I get that, I get that
And that's why we have things
Like we have
Right now
If you can bring the past
And the future into the present
You know you've done it
You know that a kidna
Will smile
Yeah, you know that half
Viper
Will smile
Okay, bring us one more
I want to take us back
We've got a couple more texts
I want you guys to see this
Yeah, go ahead, let's bring up that one
This is an email from a student of mine
And I didn't put any identifiers
For the student
But I wanted you to notice something here
I want you to notice in the middle
Of this email is some Greek
Sabazion, gun, et cetera, et cetera
You see, musterion
This person is throwing
Greek at me
And he says with regards to
Sabazius being mentioned in class
Earlier today
I did find the reference to the
Expression, dragon, and the breast
My English translation of
Clemens Petrepticus reads
The deity gliding over the breast
For the token of the
Sabazian mysteries to the initiated
However, however you like that
However, I love that
Look, this person
From learning the instrument
Of the Greek can now go
And tell the people at Harvard
To stick it in their ear
Yes, stick it in your ear, people
Stick this in your ear
Look, sabazion, gun, musterion,
Sumbulon, toys
Mu, us, menois
Ho dia colpu theos
