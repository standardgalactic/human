The god is in the end
Ho dia colpu theos
What kind of god is this?
The god dia colpu
And the translation for this
Terrible. What's it literally
Saying here? This is the god
Who comes through the colpus
The colpus, as this intrepid
Student noted below, is the vagina
That dark harbor. Do you know how
The users of the burning purple
Are referring to the cup
From which they drink? It's the dark
Harbor. Yeah, it's her
She is that source
You wonder why Jesus sat there
You can take a dump. You wonder
Why Jesus sat there and was like
Hey, you gotta eat my flesh
Drink my blood, right?
And you're sitting there wondering
You're listening to your pastor
For the 50th time is preaching on it
Usually it has something to do
With the sins of the people
And the forgiveness and the washing
And the redemption
Yes, how great thou art
How great thou art
Now you can see that it's much
More than that. That's a phony
World. That world never even existed
It's a figment of your modern
Imagination because your glasses
Your glasses only work
Your glasses only work for the middle
Ages. Yeah, okay, okay
I'm not going to waste your time
I'm not going to waste your time
I want to get to it and I want to get to the end
But I wanted you to see that God
Coming through the culprits
Yeah, the dragon
The dragon within the breast
Yeah, and now you wonder about Mary Magdalene
Everybody loves to talk about Mary Magdalene
And I just like to kick down the doors
And take Mary back. I'd like to take her back
From the pimps and academics
From the Anglicans
And from the people who tried to purify
And clarify, cleanse Mary
Who was walking around with sex drugs
Expensive sex drugs
Expensive sex drugs
Do you know we can drink
We can drink her contents
After she...
Am I back? Yeah
I think Mickey Mouse ran in the room
And turned off the switch or something
No, we can look at Mary
And we can look at her original being
And we can look at her cathartic work
And her magic, right?
But what we're focusing on now
Is we are supposed to go back with Jesus
To that place in Uganda
Where homosexuality is a capital offense
It's a capital offense
Yeah, yeah
We're beginning, we're beginning
For those of you who don't think
That you can see the future
Where this activity that we're talking about
Takes us
Those of you who don't realize this is your future
You are all Uganda
Yeah
Thank again, because it always happens
And the mortals are like, oh my goodness, I'm surprised
Right? And everybody's running around
Mass destruction
Things have fallen apart
Society's gonna decide, hey
I think I'll take a couple thousand years break
Yeah, I think I'll take a couple thousand years break
Well, this time we have the tools
This time we have the tools to do it the right way
Right? They need this apocalypse
