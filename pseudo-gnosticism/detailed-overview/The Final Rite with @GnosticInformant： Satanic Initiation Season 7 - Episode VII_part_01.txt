No more of the trailing serpent's tooth to fear.
Why not?
Why don't we need to fear the tooth?
Have you been pushing the tooth?
Is this for you?
Do you burn with that poison?
This will counteract it.
Let him who by the dragons fang have bled.
Is that you?
Is that you, sister and brother?
Is that you?
Have you bled by the dragons fang
and in the stone his sure reliance place
for wounds inflicted by the reptile race?
Have you been inflicting the wounds?
Have you made the Medusa?
Do you see her?
Do you see her coming?
Can you reach out?
Can you reach out to her?
You were reaching out to an entity.
This is not a mortal.
This is a diamond.
You're reaching out to it.
You Christians,
you have participated.
You have participated in the act
of reaching out to the Daimonis.
Yeah, you have.
Did you feel that voice?
You heard that voice at the very beginning.
You saw Satanic initiation and you said,
run that voice that Pima said, run, run.
This is of the devil.
Now you're corrupted.
Looking at it from our direction,
from the direction of this congregation,
you're cleansed.
You're cleansed, excuse me.
You're cleansed.
But from your own direction,
you've been sullied.
Look at yourself,
what you've participated in.
These images won't leave you.
You're marked now.
You are marked like a record.
Your life is a record to be read out
in a cosmic court.
You are marked.
Go, I mark you.
It's part of the contract, people.
Next one, yeah.
Yeah, oh, here's a good one.
What are the drugs can we get?
Oh, people, let's get some more drugs.
The ostrates mixed with wine
affords again a quick relief
to cool their fiery pain.
Let those of you here,
you know, who've got the ears,
do you understand the transformation here?
Those of you have been here.
Do you understand how we are describing the right?
The sacred stone that from the Viper came.
Well known to leeches
by the Viper's name.
Have you ever met a leech?
Does anybody know a leech?
Take that down for one second,
and I'm going to put it right back.
The leech, do you know the leech?
They bleed you.
They bleed you.
Why would they bleed you?
Because they need your blood.
You mean it's not just me getting rid of my blood?
No, it's not just that.
That blood is a resource.
Hmm.
Strange.
Especially if you are of a certain persuasion.
And what persuasion is that?
If you are the one that is born
by the goddess producer,
the Theatokos, Mary,
aka Mary,
if you are born of her,
it is your blood that saves.
It is your blood that saves.
Do you see what they did with Jesus?
Poor little baby.
You didn't even see a comment.
They've already got the gold
and the drugs set up.
They've already got that muron
that ends up on his face.
They've already got the basics for that.
They're ready to go.
Plus the financing.
This virgin girl is going to produce
one whose blood will save us all.
Do you wonder why Jesus
walked around talking such things?
Do you wonder?
Did you thank Christians
that he just got ejected
up from the sky into a woman's uterus,
into a girl's uterus,
into a 12-year-old's uterus?
Oh, God, it's so gross to talk about
the origins of Christianity.
It's so gross, but somebody has to do it.
Okay, I'm sorry.
The devil hates that, right?
You won't see him hanging around.
You won't see him hanging around
doing stuff like that.
You didn't see Lucifer
get arrested with a naked kid, did you?
You didn't see Lucifer
blowing his top
and kicking all of his people
out of his garden.
You didn't see him do that.
Lucifer has class, man.
He's got real class.
Hell Satan.
Let me hear it from you.
Hell Satan.
Hell Satan.
That's right, man.
Not arrested with a naked kid.
Do you think Lucifer's going to be
up on charges like that?
No.
No transdimensional court in the world
is going to do that.
Everybody knows.
Man, he's the...
What are you?
Let's go back.
Go back to the source.
Let's go back to that one.
Yep, keep reading.
So what is this leech doing?
Yeah, the sacred stone
from the Viper came.
Okay.
Listen up.
Well known to leeches by
the Viper's name.
Aided by which,
divine McCann's art
cured the rankling wound
the nine years smart
when the despairing hero now
no more hope for deliverance
from the festering sore,
but taught its virtues
by his sire on high.
With this he healed
the bold
Piantian's thigh
and sent him forth rejoicing
on his way to Troy,
the Phrygian ravisher to slay.
It's...
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
What kind of code is all that?
Right?
You heard the surface?
Now realize there's something
called the Orphic Vox.
The Orphic Vox
or the Walks Orphica.
The Orphic Vox.
And realize that you are hearing a story
and underneath the story
because you have been here
and those who went
who've been through the whole seven seasons
you're picking up those symbols like that
and picking them out.
You're getting faster than I am.
Right?
Okay.
So you know that there's a story
and underneath the story is a point.
Underneath the story is an edge,
a razor's edge.
And that's why we're going to bring you
the prophecy tonight.
Let's keep going.
Let's keep going.
Mm-hmm.
Boom.
Far greater fear
and never slumbering day or night
had Philctides of the viper's bite.
That's who was healed,
Makaion.
That's who...
That's who is healed.
Right?
Philctides.
He's the one who's
subject of the viper's bite.
Are you subject to the viper's bite?
Do you know who's worthy
of the bow of Heracles?
Do you know who's worthy?
You know what Heracles uses?
He uses the poison of the Hydra.
You squirm bags.
Yeah, that's how he would refer to you.
Yeah.
You bags of squirming rotten flesh.
You haven't been purged.
Let me introduce you to the Hydra.
Oh, God.
Who wants to go?
I want to go.
Can we just say
I want to go.
I want to go.
Can we just field trip?
Everybody?
We'll go into the mysteries.
Now, some of us may not come back.
You know, nothing ventured.
Nothing gained.
Go.
Let's go to the next one.
Oh, yeah.
Fall from the beat.
To teach some charm
that far away should chase
whenever he reached his home.
The reptile race touched by his prayer.
The wizard high reveals
the sought for antidote
nor art conceals invokes Apollo
witness of his truth
and give these precepts
to supply it.
Youth.
Yeah.
There's the youth coming to him.
Did anybody see the boys coming in?
Have you people become comfortable
enough with the pirates
to understand what the business is all about?
You remember when we were on that ship
a couple of seasons ago
with that Thracian pirate?
You remember what he did?
He had his guys go ashore
and take that young kid
and then he told him,
bring him to his room.
He's the best looking.
Right?
Best looking Thracian they could find.
And they took him.
Took him to his place of surgery
and cut off his testicles
so that when he awoke
because he had to keep him drugged
while he was asleep, right?
When he awoke,
what happened?
He was transformed into an angel.
Have you ever seen an angel birthed?
Those of you, we stand around
and we think, I say angel
and you think fairy tale.
I know you do.
You think dude in a white dress
maybe long blonde straight blonde hair
pale skin like a European
maybe blue eyes, right?
Something like that.
Big and tall and very pious looking.
Right?
No, no, no.
That's not.
That's not how angels were born.
Right?
That's not how angels were brought about.
You mean angels or creations?
Yeah.
Just like the Medusa.
Right?
And by the way,
that concept of an angel that you think
is central to Christianity and Judaism,
guess where they got it?
It's a Greek word.
When that dude in the third century,
the person in the third century,
probably Jewish,
who wrote the Torah in Greek
for the first time,
when he did that,
the bonehead encoded.
He used the Orphic mystery.
And I'm going to show you tonight.
I'm going to break the code.
Plutarch knew this straight up.
And Gnostic informants going to tell you
how Plutarch knew it.
