goddess bearer?
Do you know who he is?
He's the enemy of the dogs.
What are the dogs doing?
Let's bring that passage back up.
What are those dogs doing?
Oh, God, look at them.
Oh, God.
They're prostitutes and drug users.
Those cuneists.
We all know that.
And they're murderers, too.
And they're idolaters.
They're idolaters.
They're idolaters.
They're idolaters.
They're murderers, too.
And they're idolaters.
You know what they do?
You know what they do in the darkness of their temple?
Yeah.
You know what they do?
Yeah.
Okay.
Jesus is competing with them.
Right?
He's competing.
When that pithia comes to Jesus,
comes to Paul and says,
you're doing the Christ thing.
He's like, shut up.
Right?
He follows them around.
And then ultimately gets her in trouble
and he gets himself in trouble.
Right?
Couldn't just keep him out shut, Paul, you druggy.
You couldn't just keep him out shut.
She nailed you for her you were.
And because it scared you like it did Peter,
you shut your, you tried to shut her up.
Right?
She's just a woman.
Unfortunately for you, she was a woman
who was an oracle.
And it caused you to get the,
you know what, beaten out of you.
Who wants to see Paul?
Who wants to see Paul with those people?
Have a mess with this girl.
Because she's a pithia.
Have a mess with this girl.
And now people are beating him up.
Right?
This is the reality, people.
This is not fairy tale.
Paul, they ought to show this one.
Why don't you guys illustrate this one
in your Sunday schools?
Why don't you show Paul harassing a girl?
Misogynist.
Better to marry than to burn.
You sicko.
That's different.
That's a different court.
It's going to deal with that case.
Let's go to the next one.
And behold, you know, I come quickly
and my reward's with me.
Yeah, just jump down to 13.
We've got to hurry.
I'm the alpha and the omega.
Do you see that?
I'm the alpha and the omega.
The first and the completion of things.
Right?
The initiation and the completion.
Do you understand the omega?
The omega is when everything comes together.
This is the beginning and the T loss.
This is the completion of you.
The completion of you.
Wait, it has to do with me?
Yes.
It has to do with us.
The completion of us.
Next one.
Let's go through these.
Oh, I, Jesus, sent an angel.
Yeah.
To witness to you these things about the churches.
I am the root.
Right?
And the offspring of David.
Now, what else does he say?
Yes.
Look at the second line.
I am ho Aster.
I am the star.
Ho Lampros.
Which star?
The, you know, the bright one.
Does everybody know what the bright,
shining morning star is?
The pro oinas.
Proinos.
Excuse me.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah.
It's that morning star.
Everybody knows who the morning star is.
We Romans.
We worship the morning star.
Bunheads.
Right?
Not you.
We worship that morning star.
Let's go on.
Let's go on.
Hmm.
Who do you think is the alpha and the omega?
Didn't you think Venus was the alpha and the omega?
Of course.
Right?
It has to be.
A lot of you thought Venus is Venus because I've seen her through a modern lens.
No.
No.
No.
No.
Venus is much more than you think.
Much more.
So much more that Jesus is stealing her thunder.
Isn't that nice?
Jesus is stealing the thunder of the goddess Venus.
Right?
That's her title.
That's her title, you moron.
Take that away.
I take that.
I petition this court to remove the title of Jesus.
I petition this court to give it back to Venus.
To whom it belongs and to whom it was with for thousands of years.
Give it back.
Belongs to her.
Let's go.
Next one.
Oh, look at this.
Look at this.
Okay.
Yeah.
This is the river.
I don't know why.
I wanted you to see it again.
I wanted you to see it again for some reason.
But I've got four or five more.
Let's keep up a pace here.
Look at verse 15.
Now you're saying, where is this from?
Guess what, kiddies?
Remember that Jewish guy that wrote the Torah in the third century BC?
Remember him?
This is what he's writing.
And this is from Exodus.
It sounds so funny, right?
Extodos.
Guess what language gave us that?
Right?
Okay.
And what did he say?
What is God's command to Aaron and the boys, the Levites?
What's the command?
What's the command?
And you got to make an oracle.
You got to make an oracle?
Logheon is an oracle.
You got to make an oracle of Christian.
Whoa.
What?
Go to the next.
Go to the next.
You got to make a what?
You got to make an oracle.
Look, people.
Look at number two.
They knew this in antiquity.
I mean, they knew this in the last 200 years.
I'm not bringing up anything new.
This is the thing that they're making that the high priest is going to walk around in.
Okay.
Do you see it?
Here it's coming.
Here it's coming to reality.
Ready?
Ready?
Go to the next one.
It's what kind of oracle is it?
It's an oracle of, look at number three and four.
It's an oracle of election.
It's an oracle of dreams.
It's an oracle of dreams.
Importance.
Didn't you know that the tent that Moses set up was called a Telestarian?
Telestarian.
Now there is no word for that in Hebrew, right?
So all of this has to be fudged when it's time for people to appropriate and they start
taking the Greek and translating it into what is by then liturgical Hebrew.
So they only have like, they only have like 8,000 words.
I'm sorry, but it is such a bad idea.
It is such a bad idea.
The fact that those knuckleheads couldn't figure out that they couldn't possibly translate
the technical terminology is hilarious.
I had a couple of verses for you.
I was going to bring and show you just, it was verse 12, 28, 12, and I was going to show
you, um, look, the Greek uses two words with the same root right next to each other for
a reason here, like it loves to do.
And the Hebrew doesn't know what to do.
The Hebrew doesn't know what to do.
So it uses two different, totally different terms that are only related to the art that
the Greek is talking about.
The art that the Greek was talking about is embroidery.
Right.
So, um, it's, you know, it's there, it's there.
I hope, I hope, uh, it's, there's so much to be done.
There's so much to be done with that.
Let's keep going.
I'm almost there.
Nostics.
I'm almost there.
But wait, we've got a good thing coming up.
Okay.
Blow this up.
Now people, here is the sacred document.
And I just want to, I, I've shown you a couple of lines of this in the past.
This is the Orphic Lithica.
Right.
And he says, look, Hermes, the son of Maya, he, he came here and he gave us a gift.
He gave us the gift of the danger of hurting Zeus or the danger of hurting God.
Right.
And what is this thing?
It's an, it's a remedy.
It's a remedy for all of your pain.
It's a remedy for your pain.
Yeah.
And the mortals that take it, right?
These people are going to, they're going to do good things.
Right.
And they have to be in a certain state.
They have to have a heart that's pure.
All right.
You got to have pure heart.
These Satan still wants you messing around with any of this magic.
If you're not pure heart, you know what I mean?
Come on, man.
You can't get there anyway.
You got, you have the least bit of greed in you.
You have just one sliver.
Throw that silver coin out.
You grab that thing.
That's it.
You're done.
There's no purity there.
You greedy scumbag.
That's what the, that's what the furies say.
Greedy scumbag.
That's their line.
Okay.
Look, it's not right.
It's not right for people who are like these bad people.
It's not right for them to have visions anyway.
So the stuff that I'm going to show you,
it's, it's just for those of us with ears to hear who have been purified.
And once you, but how do you take someone who has,
who believes, you know, maybe they're Buddhist,
maybe they're Hindu, maybe they're Jewish,
maybe they're Christian, maybe they're a Mormon Scientologist.
I don't care.
Right.
Maybe they're an atheist.
Maybe they're an atheist.
They sit around.
What gets the Christians, what gets the atheists or what should get them is that
they're named after the Christians.
The Christians are the first people to achieve that name atheist.
Isn't that nice?
Why?
Because they don't believe in justice.
Christians don't believe in justice.
No, they don't.
Do you want evidence?
They'll take out your government.
Yeah.
They don't care.
Justice doesn't matter.
They let criminals out of jail.
And they'll put people in jail for taking care of their own bodies.
Yeah.
I'm just telling you what Julian said.
I'm just telling you what Salsis said.
They are illiterate idiots who will take down your government.
This is what they're all saying from antiquity.
And you and I are watching it.
We have a front row seat.
Jesus must love the hell out of us because we're right there to watch them take it down.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You remember the blood of tyrants and their patriots must be shed where you will not retain decay.
You won't keep your liberty.
You won't keep your freedom.
I'm sorry.
That's my American coming out.
There's got to be a little American in all of us, right?
Okay.
Let's go.
