and rose in the third day.
You're signing that for your degree?
Yeah.
They still do that in 2023.
Yeah.
I didn't get that far.
It's all mind-blowing.
I didn't get that far though.
I don't think you would have agreed to that, would you?
Even back in the 90s, you probably would have.
No, but I was getting so.
You see, I had had a bachelor's in classics by this point.
Yeah.
So although I'd love Jesus Christ
and wanted to continue my mission work
and go through Dallas Seminary,
the classics was rooting itself in my brain.
And after a while, I was like,
look, their Greek sucks here.
They do weird stuff.
It's kind of touchy-feely weird.
Biblical Greek?
Biblical Greek?
What's that?
Well, you should learn Biblical Greek.
You're stuck in this box.
It's only Greek terms that are you found in the New Testament
or Septuagint, right?
So you don't actually go outside
and find out where these words mean
and what the etymologies are, where they come from.
Do they come from Orpheus?
Do they come from Plato?
Do they come from Homer?
You're looking at it saying,
oh, this word shows up in the Septuagint
and now it's being used in the New Testament.
So it only can mean these certain things.
You're stuck in the box.
Biblical Greek, what's that?
Yeah.
I had a bachelor's degree in Greek and Latin.
It was in the classics department, right?
And it was in Greek and Latin.
I double majored, right?
I did both.
And what was funny was going from that
at a major university,
I went to the University of Arizona
and the Wildcats.
And anyway, after getting that technical exposure,
I was able to go to seminary and see right away.
I mean, the world that they live in
with their language is so unscientific.
I have students come to me from biblical classes.
They've got to do so much biblical Greek, right?
And I get them and I have to sit them down.
I have to reprogram them.
And I say, look, this is a science.
So you can stop messing around
and you can learn the fundamentals, right?
And I can take somebody like that
and train out the bad that seminary gives them.
But it all comes down to Acts again,
the book of the Acts of the Apostles.
When the people saw them talk,
when they saw Peter and John talk,
they said they're two things.
Number one, they're illiterate.
And number two, they're stupid.
Right.
And they said,
I went to Dallas Theological Seminary.
The one passage I left.
And that's what I found at Dallas Theological Seminary.
It reminds me of the passages where they walk up to Paul,
the Stoics and Epicureans are sitting in Athens.
I'm picturing them with their beards like mine right now
and they're wearing their togas.
And these are some strange notions you bring to our ears.
Tell us more.
And then it says he told them more
and some of them were like, oh, I got to go.
And only if you stayed behind.
And I'm laughing because I'm like, this is probably true.
This sounds like a true text.
I think that part is historical.
That's a funny text.
It's like Paul is sitting there in Athens going,
I want to tell you about Jesus.
And they all walk up and say, huh?
This is some strange notions you bring to our ears.
Go on.
Go on, sir.
Tell us.
Well, he resurrected.
Oh, I got to go.
I'm out of here.
And he's looking around at the statues
and he sees one of them says to an unknown God.
And it's probably Theo's hipstose, right?
The unnamed God.
And he's looking around saying, that's him.
That's ours.
We have the same one.
So funny.
I don't know.
That's how I read that part.
And people think, Neil, that this guy Paul is a genius.
Oh, this is the author of the Romans.
And they talk about him like, who, huh?
Dude, I've read lots of classical authors.
Lots of people before Paul and after Paul.
And I can tell you for a fact,
I wouldn't put Paul in the top 60, 70 authors
that I know from antiquity who could, you know,
whose works make his look kind of like brainwashing.
Yeah, he's crazy.
Yeah.
He's out of his mind talking about, yeah,
you need the gnosis.
You need to, he says in Corinthians, gnosis,
speaking in tongues and prophesying.
If you don't have, you have to have all three,
but if you don't have all three, you gotta have faith too.
And if you don't have faith, then you don't have all three.
But if you have all three and you have faith, then you're good.
Sounds like he's going crazy when you read it.
When you read Corinthians, it sounds like someone going crazy.
You know he's being backed by the purple, right?
He's got Lydia and all the backing that he needs for that.
So, okay, I understand.
That's what's financing what he's doing.
But I think he was bringing those good eastern drugs to the Greeks.
And that's why they're like, yeah.
All right, we'll fund your project.
Come on in.
Come to Corinthians and start the church here.
Bring some of that good Egyptian, some good Arabian,
you know, whatever you got.
He was pushing the venom.
He was pushing the viper venom, baby.
I mean,
He's having visions of the seventh heaven.
He's, you know, he's dancing.
You know what that means.
You and I know what that means.
Yeah.
Yeah, the angel came to him.
Yeah, the angel came to him.
He's floating up to the seventh heaven, he said,
or the third heaven, he said.
Yeah.
All right, we know how you got there.
There's only one way to get there.
There's only one way to get to the third heaven,
to float up to the third heaven.
And what's funny is people who follow the fairy tale.
I mean, think about somebody trying to make sense of it.
What do you think is just happening naturally?
Think of a very simple minded person.
Somebody who's really concrete, really down to earth
and just straightforward, right?
And Paul says, I got boosted up to the so and so heaven.
And there I was.
And right.
And what is this person trying to,
did you see him get struck by the snake?
That thing didn't hurt him.
He's got, this guy's pushing the thorn.
That's what they call it.
This guy's pushing the thorn.
Right.
So he's one of those frigging pirates.
Yeah.
Remember we looked up the buckthorn in Greek, the accounta.
And then it said like acacia roots as,
on the bottom on what we call, what's the website?
Perseus Tufts.
It defined that exact drug as acacia.
Like that's DMT right there.
That's crazy.
I didn't even know that until,
that's why I love that website.
But Paul, yeah.
And I think whoever wrote James,
they say it's James or whoever or someone else,
maybe that wrote James, whatever.
Whatever the case is.
I'll just say James.
James just says, text says James.
I'm just going to call it James.
Anyways, whoever wrote that was responding to Paul,
talking shit and saying,
you don't know what you're talking about, dude.
All your shit about faith cares.
He goes, even demons have faith.
Who gives a shit about faith?
I love that text, dude.
Was he the one,
one of those James has got thrown off the Temple Mount.
Yeah, that's the one.
Yeah.
What do you have to do at work
to piss people off so much
they throw you out of the building?
I don't know.
Any ideas?
Probably super high.
Probably probably just bothering everybody
for being too high.
Here we go.
Here's the text right here.
I'm sharing my screen on the right.
You can pull it up.
He says, you believe that there's one God.
Good.
Even demons believe that.
Like, it's basically like the way it's supposed to be written,
the way it's supposed to be.
This is supposed to be sarcastic, the good part.
So tell me this, Neil.
Tell me, because I really want to expand on this
and then I'm going to call it.
The Bacchic Empire,
as you're reading all of these sources
and you're finding out that there's all of this,
you kind of get the sense of what Bacchic worship is,
hits this area at this time, hits thieves, hits Rome.
Any...
Oh, Baptists, too.
There's an organization.
Yes, and the Baptists is part of it.
It's all part of the same movement.
There's an organization to this, isn't it?
That people are not...
I think the oracular structure is what's keeping,
because those oracles are the ones
that are given orders to say,
go do this colony.
Yes, you can go to war.
Even when Athens is fighting with Sparta,
as late as that, right?
Classical Greece.
What happens?
It's all oracles, right?
They're generals.
It's always women that perform the oracles.
Yeah, those generals are listening to the oracles.
Isn't that funny how in the ancient world,
we always talk about patriarchy
and how women don't have roles in these religions,
modern Islam and Christianity.
In the ancient world, they had ordained women
in these high roles of high priestesses,
handling the snakes, the serpents,
and handling the drugs,
and giving the oracles to these kings
and these generals, telling them what to do.
They were way ahead of their time.
I'm telling you, democracy, all that stuff.
Athena, the image of Athena, Minerva.
You go to Independence Hall in Pennsylvania
or in Washington, D.C.,
and you see Minerva, Lady Liberty.
That's all ancient democracy from Athens.
They were way ahead of their time.
You know what I mean?
You think we'll be able to keep that all in with this?
Final question.
Thank you for coming tonight.
This has been absolutely wonderful.
Final question for you.
What makes you rap with this?
Tell me now you told us everything about the past.
Tell me now about the present and the immediate future.
Are we going to be able to keep liberty
or is the government going to be challenged and overthrown?
We're keeping it.
Because I know that liberty always prevails.
Look at history.
Even if there's some dark ages that rise up,
eventually, Athena always wins.
That's what I'll say.
That's my oracle.
As long as we recognize that we can go backwards,
that it is possible, and funny thing is,
this happens when groups like,
I don't know, who did it in the third and fourth century?
Christians.
When the Christians challenged the government,
they were able to get a person to endorse them.
A desperate guy named Constantine.
I think he had orange hair.
He said, I am now part of the whole key row society.
What happened?
Everyone is like, what the?
Julian that you mentioned tonight,
the Christians, you have to understand people out there.
Julian, the emperor that Neil mentioned tonight.
Try to save the world.
Try to save the world.
Try to save civilization.
I got to say this,
because the way the Christians treated the Jews
for 1,500 years was real rough.
Orcing them into ghettos,
basically treating them secondhand,
they weren't Roman citizens.
They had to be treated like animals, right?
Julian, who wanted to bring the ancient rights back,
said, is Jerusalem belongs to the Jews?
He wanted to build the temple again.
That's in the sources.
