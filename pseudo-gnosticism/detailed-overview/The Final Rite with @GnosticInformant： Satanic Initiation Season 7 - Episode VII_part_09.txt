So this guy really did want to keep the world back
into its balance and where it was supposed to be.
He said that.
Yahweh, that's Israel.
Let them have their God.
Let Alexandria be ruled by Serapis.
Let Athens be ruled by Athena.
He had this system that he was envisioned
what it's supposed to be.
That's true.
You got to give him credit,
especially since all of his male relatives
were executed by the Christians
when he was just a tiny kid.
The only reason he was alive was
it would look too bad if they killed a child.
Sometimes we can walk over that line.
It makes us all queasy.
Your vote is we keep Lady Liberty here.
We follow justice.
We shed the blood of tyrants
onto the Tree of Liberty
to make our republic stand.
Your sister, Ro, who do I get to be?
I want to find out who I am.
I'm a sister, Ro.
Are you coming with the opposite?
No, I want to be with you.
I want to keep the republic.
Brutus.
You got your dagger. You're Brutus.
Sister Ro and Brutus.
I'm glad you said that.
I was hoping you would say that
because I think they were on the right.
Caesar, whatever.
He's a great general
and the emperor,
but he was on the wrong side of history.
That's my opinion.
Sister Ro was on the right side of history.
That's my opinion.
I've read a lot of the sources.
I'm a big fan of Lucian Civil War
and a big fan of Sister Ro.
I'm a big fan of Diodorus
and Ovid
and Cassie's Dio
and all these great Virgil.
My come away with that time period
was Sister Ro tried to save the republic
and that was the way to go.
Who knows what could have happened
if something intact.
He was trying.
He put himself
between their past
republic
and this wave of imperialism
that ultimately
wiped him out.
They couldn't.
When you make your central power so powerful
that they can do anything,
as soon as you get someone in there
with no limits,
everything's going to crumble.
A government like that
is to keep fighting wars.
You got to get
allegiance out there.
You got to take more land.
That's the only way to keep that type of system going.
That's why they call it the Dark Ages
and the Middle Ages is all
the Ostrogoths, the Vandals,
the Huns,
all warrior cultures
trying to kill each other over
kingdoms and land.
When you have a republic
with a
Senate that represents
the people at large,
you balance the power out more.
Thomas Jefferson
and Thomas Paine
they realized this
after the Enlightenment.
Those Greeks had it figured out.
Nietzsche was big into the Greeks.
We have to go back to what they were doing.
This is the only way.
All this Holy Roman Empire crap
that's got to go.
You either are living
as a serf
or you're a billionaire living in a church,
like a trillionaire,
equated to today's money.
That's what they were, these high cardinals
and bishops living in...
They're the only ones that enjoyed life.
Life was only good if you were one of those people.
To anyone else, life sucked.
I hate this new thing
that historians do now.
They'll say, the Dark Ages
is as dark as we thought.
It was actually pretty good. For who?
For fucking who? I hate that shit.
I push back against that.
I don't care. I still call it the Dark Ages.
I'm going to keep continuing to call it that.
Prove it otherwise.
Scotland.
Edinburgh has a wonderful museum
of
the middle-aged torture devices
that are used to extract
information from people.
If your group
is into that, if your brotherhood
is into beating
and abusing people,
this is a good place for it.
No, thank you very much, Middle Ages.
I think I'd rather
fly with the people
who talked about the Golden Age.
You know what they said?
The Romans said their Golden Age was?
It was the Pax Romana.
It was that time
when those doors were shut
and there aren't wars.
Right? How do you bring
that civilization?
That's what Lucan gets at in his Pharsalia
where he emphasizes
it's the time of peace
when people
are happy.
During times of war, it's just death
and sadness and depression.
Nothing good comes from war.
That's why I see these idiots on Twitter
with their Alexander the Great
thumbnails
and they'll say like, Christian warrior
and they're like, look how
based it was back in ancient Rome
and they don't know what the fuck they're talking about.
None of these people ever had to
take a spear
or a stat.
They had no idea what it was like.
Homer made it clear
war is not that great.
It sucks. Read the Iliad.
Homer describes
what happens when
Ajax throws a spear
and it goes through somebody
and they start to break out
and they lose their consciousness
and then they're gone.
Homer writes that out very vividly.
Homer is trying to tell you war is not fun
and Achilles was
the symbol of
how war
can really
tear people apart.
Achilles has to kill Hector
and my father has to grieve for his son.
That's why
they call this text divine because it's so true.
Yeah.
Mars lays down with Venus.
Right?
That's the thing.
That's that Roman ideal.
That's that triad.
To get to that.
To get to that perfect civilization.
That was the dream
of the seven hills.
And that stuff was appropriated
through time and used.
The Christians have used those
images for centuries
and distorted them
just like Julian said.
He said they're going to distort everything.
It turns out they did.
So that the images that we get
their Bible times
are just totally.
Come on. Who believes
any of that stuff anymore?
Can you? Oh my god.
I won't start because we've been long enough.
Thank you.
Neil, I'm going to give you
a last chance to comment here.
Thank you for coming on
Satanic Initiation.
Glad to have you before the show's over.
I want to tell people
Wednesday, our very last
show will be a
I will sum up.
I'll give you the attorney
for the Transdimensional Authority.
I'll sum up
with the charges against Jesus
and then I will give
us a chance to come to a
verdict via you
and whether it will be
a poll or whether we'll just be scanning
the chance. Either way
it should be fun and we'll have
a little bit of fun and I'll end up with a few
comments. Just a way
of thanking you and
for being involved and thank you
Neil and you've got the last
word tonight on Satanic Initiation.
Hail Satan. Hail Satan.
I'm working on a video right now
about this time of the year
for Winter Solstice
Saturnalia. This time
of the year is a special time of the year to
magical time of the year and
there's light in the darkness.
You know,
Hanukkah, the idea of Hanukkah
where they light the menorah, the light in the darkness.
This is that solstice time
of the year.
So I'm
working on a video that I'm done
with the script and I'm recording it now
and I'll be editing it. It'll be out in the next
week probably five, six days
and it's about this time of the year
and this certain rights. It goes back to
Haola,
Haola. The ancient
Greeks had a Bacchic Festival
during this time of the year. Before the
Romans did Saturnalia, the Greeks had a
different winter festival
dedicated to Bacchus. That's in the video.
Solendictus stuff,
Saturnalia stuff,
some of the
Christian ideas.
It's all about, the whole video is going to be about
the ancient festivals
and the showing the sources of what they said
about this time of the year. Interesting
shit. The Egyptians had
temples built that would mark
the sun and the sky and there's fascinating
shit. The sun would line up in a certain
place during the winter solstice.
Cool shit.
That's what's coming next.
Gorgeous, gorgeousness
and gorgeosity all wrapped up.
Love it, I love it.
Okay guys, thank you for coming tonight.
Everybody want there?
Happy birthday Lucifer.
Yeah, happy birthday.
That's what this month is.
That's what this month is.
Birth of Lucifer.
We should say happy birthday to the devil
on the final episode.
That would be nice.
Okay, thank you guys
for coming tonight. Hail Satan.
Hail Satan.
