Classical necromancers practice their religion by opening portals to the kingdom of the dead
The oldest symbols, the earliest western prophets
And these are the symbols of the Vatican Hill, baby
These are the real ones, the ones who are saying
Listen up, and your source here is John Littis
They're saying, listen up
We're going to tell you all of history
They're like, what?
We're going to tell you all of history
We're going to show it to you, it's going to be so shocking
It's going to be so accurate that you're going to want to keep it in a vault
You're going to want to keep it in a treasury
Yeah, serious stuff
All of them women
Moses is bound to the Iraqi tradition
Otherwise he wouldn't be holding up a serpent on a pole
He wouldn't have a tent full of clouds, they got to put a rope on your leg
You say, when you're going to the temple, that's weird
Isn't that weird? Because they're going to have to pull you out
If you collapse, right? With everything that got on the altar
What do you think you burn on altars? Not on meat, right?
Lots of drugs and antiquity, lots of drugs
The oldest symbols, the earliest western prophets
taught that the resurrection or summoning of the gods from the underworld
was a necessary step in restoring justice to the universe
You have the final judgment, and some of you will talk about the final judgment
See the Christ, the Christians will talk very pompously
Yes, judgment seat of Christ, I'm a dominionist
pre-tribulationalist, millennialist, master-patorious, maximus
It's just so much humiliating, circle-jerkery
That's performed, theologians love it
But this idea of this judgment was because, and you'll love this people
is because the generation of iron, they called us
They called us the generation of iron
The last god, says the Greek mind, the last god to leave mortals
Justice
She left the generation of iron
Because she saw that she had no place
She was the last god to leave
She hung in there as long as she could
But as soon as you say, what happened?
What happened to the justice system?
