Money happened to the justice system
Money happened to the justice system
And those Greeks knew, as soon as you get money, you get the corruption of democracy
You get the corruption of democracy
Those gods that help protect you, like Athena Nikkei
The virgin we all protect
That virgin democracy
Justice, we all protect justice
We all want to preserve justice
If we don't sacrifice to justice, we're not going to keep our society
That's it, and we're going to be hit with things
That we don't have the defenses for
This is why we call those gods here
It's why we have these specific gods
Remember, the Christians were first called atheists by the pagans
Because they said, you have no gods, you have no justice
How can you not worship Nikkei?
We don't worship any god, but this one dude who's going to come back and slaughter you all
That was the creative faith
Imagine that as a creative faith
And if you don't think that modern day evangelicals think the very same thing
You're fooling yourself
There are people around you who are waiting for your slaughter
It's just a matter of time
I got one bit of bad news
Devils only give me five more minutes
I've got one bit of bad news for the evangelicals in the group
The Catholics may or may not care
But the evangelicals, I need to let you know there is no resurrection
There is no rapture
The word in Greek that you have mistaken for rapture is apostasy
Yeah, let that sink into a minute
Those of you who are talking to the evangelicals now
Those of you who are looking for the rapture
Those of you who are looking for it
There isn't one
There is no word for rapture
There isn't
It's the word apostasy
There has to be a falling away
There has to be a falling away
The root
