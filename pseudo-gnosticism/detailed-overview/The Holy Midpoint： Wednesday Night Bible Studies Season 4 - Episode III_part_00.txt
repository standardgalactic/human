Drinking whiskey, when that whisky's burned through my veins
Indians go crazy and the Scotsman wants to bash out the brain
Of an English man, don't know why
Got a little mixed up in the hills of Carolina
You see you've got your selling and you got your drinking whiskey
Oh yeah, drinking whiskey
Oh yeah
Welcome back to Lady Babylon, Wednesday night Bible studies
We're going to be spending a little bit of our time with Juno tonight
As you can see, as you can see Juno say hello
Juno's been with us for quite a while
So she is quite interested in the studies
Thank you for coming
Tonight we're going to push further into the Mithraic Liturgy
So-called, we're going to see what the actual liturgy is
And we're going to push one level deeper into that mystery
We're also going to take a look tonight at the midpoint in this journey
And we are going to celebrate the midpoint with a few comments
A few comments, a little time for me to answer questions
We'll call some of them questions from evangelicals
That's tonight on Lady Babylon
So, we're going to begin tonight with a couple of comments that people have sent in
And I just want to let people be a sounding board here
And let's hear what they're saying
Can you bring the first one up Chewie? Thanks
Oh, fantastic
I'm obviously not Christian
But Amen is not a valuable source for a lot of classics information
Yes, the Christian church has done a lot of harm to people
Don't get me started on Christianity's harm to indigenous peoples in my country
But you do not need to falsify what happened in the Bible to present that position
There are ulterior motives on Amen's part
He has a vendetta not only because of the harms that Christianity has done
But because he was kicked out of teaching at Christian schools
For inappropriate behavior
I.e. putting a dildo in a play with children as audiences
There are better ways to fight against the abuses of Christianity
Than building a cult of hate
That was from Dark Celestial Witch
That was from Dark Celestial Witch
Dark Celestial Witch, thank you for your time
Thank you for paying attention
And thank you for your input
Yes, when the group that critiques reviews classical scholars
Upcoming and already coming
Called Brynmar
When they critique the chemical muse
They said this is a dangerous book
Amen obviously has ulterior motives
Ulterior motives
These are ulterior motives floating around
I love it
I love ulterior motives, why wouldn't I?
Yes, the problem is we want the text Divine Dark Witch
And so we're going to those texts whether anybody likes it or not
So truly it's the material
It's the material that cuts so sharply
It's the reason that you cannot be 100% faithful to that muse
Muse of antiquity and still sell yourself
Within a system that is designed to sell
Yes, but hey, we look for the pure source
We look for the pure source
And next comment please
Let's do another one
This is good, it's good feedback
Nearly a full hour in before the kid got naked in the garden
Well done, Amen
Personal record, thank you, yes
I'm glad that you've noticed I tried to mention that naked kid quite frequently
It's a full hour, I don't know what happened that night
Let's go on to the last comment please
Amen's past with the Christian hierarchy
Oh this sounds, it already sounds good
Listen to it, it sounds like a historian slash psychologist
Slash expert in the Inquisition
Amen's past with the Christian hierarchy
It's just a tinge, just a tinge of arrogance
Love it, love is my religion
Do you have a name?
Love is my religion has resulted in building hatred towards Jesus
Condemn the excessiveness
But you have no understanding says love is my religion
Of Jesus' teachings
You are filled with hatred and negativity
Remember what we have to, the way that we have to walk as Satanists
Is always facing reality
Always facing reality
We need to dive into this work
If nothing else based upon the resistance
The resistance is there to do so
We are reconstructing the mystery and of course
Of course it's going to make people afraid
We're here on warrant, right?
We have an indictment against this guy
In how many parallel universes?
Yes, there's an indictment always ending up in the garden
Always ending up in the garden with the boy
Yes, bring that last comment up one more time
I want to say one more thing
Jesus doesn't need it
You don't have to put the S after it, that's okay
Whoops, can you get us back? There we go
In the Christian hierarchy resulted in his hatred, right?
But make sure you know, this gentleman or she, whoever it is
Has an understanding of Jesus' teachings that I do not
I would just appeal to you
Love of all religions
I would just appeal to you
Try to consider that you may be sitting there
Consider it a thought experiment
I'm trying to reach out to you evangelicals
I'm trying, just as I did to bring you to life
You drunkards
Just as I brought those drunkards and the mission to life
I want to bring you to a rebirth
Love of all religions
Yes, I want you to bring you to that place
Are you ready?
You have never read the Bible
You have never read the Bible
If I could have you in my gym
We could read together within a few hours
The entire New Testament
Yeah, that's a workout
Seeing how far you can get in an hour
Is a workout for those of us who do ancient Greek
Yeah, let me honestly
