Love of all religions
You have never, please
Just think to yourself
Is there a possibility I have never read the Bible
Yes, when you do
Come back and tell me about the pirate child
Trafficking savior of yours
Who was arrested in a public park at 4 a.m.
With a naked boy
Leave the glory bombs at home
Yes, okay
So the rest of us are here
To take that resistance
You feel that resistance?
Use it as a wave
Use it as a wave, right?
As much as you desire to uncover
They desire to cover up, right?
These are the same people that shout
At the bank of cameras that are recording them
You are lying
Yes, yes, right
Remember, remember
There's just one question
Job, Job brings the whole thing down, right?
It's not that the man's entire family was killed
That's not what bothers us
What bothers us is whether he would curse the God who would do it
Yeah, yeah
I'll tell you this much
If somebody killed my whole family after lying to them
I sure as heck would not be amenable to their suggestions
But for the love of all religions
There we are
We're not here, though
Love, I'll just call you love from now on
Love, we're not here
Yes, you're in custody, love
Right, we've got you shackled, no
Love, we need to dip deep tonight
Juno wants to go deep and she wants to see
Everybody, get on that, everybody in the ship now
Let's go, let's go, let's get in it
We're gonna have an in-flight film
But I want us to get on that ship
And we're headed back to that Mithraic initiation
We're there with our daughter
Remember that, you guys remember
We're there with our daughter
We saw that guy with his daughter
And he was taking her in for the initiation
She's already been prepped with instructions
And we managed, somebody managed to sneak out
And get his, you're welcome
To sneak out and get his diary, right
We got his personal notes
Isn't that nice, somebody throw him away
In a garbage dump
Why, because they contain the stuff
They contain the stuff that Paul said
Do not greed
You gotta ask yourself, is Neva Angelico
Maybe you're an apologist
Those guys are ridiculous
You know what's better than seeing somebody
Born again, somebody die again
That's, when you see that soul collapse
And that new birth decay
Then you know what nature is for
You know what I mean, then you know
Then you know, yes
How great that art
Let's keep going, let's keep going
So we're inside the ship
And we're flying there
I'm just taking up your time
So that we can get there
We're at that ceremony
And here we see
Here she comes
Here comes the dance
Here comes the song
And we are transported there
By the Alpha and the Omega
We tune ourselves up completely
And we are there, Alpha and Omega
Portals open
Did anybody bring the drugs?
Did, oh man
Fish, somebody go get fish
Fish, did you bring the drugs?
Somebody, who was supposed to prep these things?
Who was supposed to prep?
Somebody was, my goodness
Don't worry, it's a good thing
He wrote it all down
Whoever stole that journal
Congratulations, that was the smartest one of us
Right, here we go
So, yeah, let's just read
I want to take you to a section
That we haven't done yet
I want to take you to a section
Here we go
Take a sunscarf, which has 12 rays
And make it fall into a deep turquoise cup
At the time when the moon is visible
Put it together with the seed
With the fruit pulp with the lotus and honey
And after grinding it, prepare a cake
And at once, you will see it, the scarab
Moving forward and eating it
And when it has consumed it, it immediately dies
Pick it up, throw it into a glass vessel
Of excellent rose oil, much as you wish
And spreading sacred sand in the pure manner
Set the vessel on it and say the formula
Over the vessel for seven days
While the sun is mid-heaven
We're going to be singing with our drugs
There's so many drugs here tonight, right?
Not only that, but does anybody smell that?
Does anybody smell the air?
We're in the mystery riot, right?
You can see the Christians doing this
We're in the mystery riot
What is that smell?
