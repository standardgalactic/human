oh my goodness
here he is
the morning star
how nice
how do we get here
we get here for the water of dawn
if you had asked me
said Jesus to the woman well
and nobody understands it
especially not any Baptist
if you had asked me
I would give you
living water
yeah
yeah
he was right there
speaking of Baptist
evangelicals
we have to keep up
we've got a clip tonight
I think the clip speaks for itself
it's just another
co-conspirator in the long line
of co-conspirators
who have sprung
from Jesus Christ
hit it Chewie
I
did it escalate
yeah
it escalated up a time
and it started getting more hands on
more
grabbing you by the shirt
grabbing you by the neck
getting real real aggressive
I was in there getting beat on
with a paddle
no clothes
I want people to speak up like I'm doing
I'm right here talking to you right now
my face is on display right now
about what happened to me
tell your story
it really do count
what does the future look like for you
what the future look like for me
uh
you know how many stars
is in the universe
so my future is just
too many absence
my future is in my hands
it's actually in my hands
look we can
come here
so that I can
perform some sort of
masturbatory
scholarship
and
you guys can sit and say
oh isn't this
isn't this wonderful and I can feel better
and you can feel better
or we can say we're not here for that
yeah we're not here for that
we're here to get to the bottom
we're here to open up the reality
we're here to find out what Jesus is doing
with that naked kid
we want to see the rights
we want to know what was going on
I'm offering you
that view of the
rights behind the curtain
this is with the temple
doors open
when the abomination of desolation
yeah
the abomination of the
erimosis
erimosis
when the dot
and antidote sit in the temple
you'll know
run to the hills
run to the hills bockens
it's time for the possession
it's time for the Christ to come back
yeah
what did I do
what did I do
the American Association
of University Professors
along with an international
branch sent members
to
my school
to St. Mary's University
to investigate
my firing
they determined
that I was terminated inappropriately
that it was a matter of
free speech
and not a matter of violating policy
did I make people uncomfortable
there is an edge
there is an edge
to the reality
there is an edge
to the drugs
that allows you
to cut
against the resistance
the reality
burns
through
the chasm
it burns through that emptiness
yeah
all for the sake of visualization
right
I want to read you one more thing
from your text
there also came forth
