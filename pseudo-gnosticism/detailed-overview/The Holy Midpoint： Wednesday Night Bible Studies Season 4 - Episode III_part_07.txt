and then he goes on and on
and with
this list of ingredients now the
mythrodetic forms
of this are way are way
longer and it's
even plenty remarks on it
and he says as it's been noted everybody knows this
um it's ridiculous
these this list of ingredients
is is too long
right how can you possibly
make such a complex combo
back then the contemporaries
were saying my god
these drugs are advanced
so the thing of us is we try to catch up
right we try to say
wait a minute what are all these
what are all these drugs doing in combo
okay let's go up one more
I want to show you a couple more texts
um
uh no
let's see no I can't
it's too I made it too small
in a way I wanted to focus in
yeah
um
no that's fine
wasn't what I wanted
let's go I want to go to a couple words
here just to show you up
um this was from
just last time I want to make sure
you caught this that the oyster
is the um to go
crazy right so this is that
phase that we're entering into
and I want to give you a couple
I had a couple look at the anatole
what is that rising that we're
getting out of this ceremony
this is what we're getting we're
getting a rise we're getting
that point at which the sun
rises there's a reason
where we're here look at it also
means epitole right
fantastic so keep an eye on that
what is the epitole the rising
of a star
yeah can also be the rising
of a wind so for
those of you who have ears to
hear and you know that
our cult
is harnessing the winds
you'll understand why she
has to have seven stars
in her hand and he
tells us in this text he tells
us this is all about the contritus
right and
what is that well here
you can see it equals the deep sass
right so there's something
again about that deep sass
that is involved in our
right with our daughter
it is a kentra for
it's something that carries
with a sting
right it's something that bears
the sting
look how porphyries contain
the center of the universe
okay
those of you with ears to
hear you're going to enter
into a state of kentra
mania yeah what is
something that's kentra manes
that's something that's maddened
by that kentron
but look there's an association
with
the sexuality
uh oh
love is what makes you mad
love is what makes you mad
and puts you into that state
so that you can be one of these
kentriadai
these priests at Athens who drove
an ox to an altar with the gods
right these guys were the
guys of the goads
they were the ones who goaded
on
where we get with this thing
ultimately ending up being
a membrum we relay
right
that posthe is there
for a reason
okay because we're in that sexual
right
fantastic fantastic
okay bring them back
so
I wanted you to see some of the images
that are around we're in
I want to go one more time
this uh
mithras liturgy during a bible study
which we'll do next week the reason
I wanted to do this is
um if you are
able to put yourself
in the performance of a mystery
you can take anything
that a professor
from an ivy league school
has said and you can
shove it
in a place where he's going to be
