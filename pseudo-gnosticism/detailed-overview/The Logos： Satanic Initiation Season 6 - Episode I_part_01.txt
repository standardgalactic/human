Hit us with the first hit us with our first bit of Greek.
Who am I tonight?
I want you to say my name.
Right.
Who am I?
I'm the Christos Wanox.
Uh-oh.
And then everybody in Greek says, but there's an oak there.
Yeah.
I am not the Christos Wanox.
And I just wanted to wake you up with this.
What is it?
What is a Christ Wanox?
Have you heard of the Christ Wanox?
Yes.
Very, very old, old, old, old, old Mycenaean.
Love it.
This is the kind of stuff that you're delving into the vocabulary of a Bronze Age cult.
And you say, why are they calling Jesus the Christ, the Bronze Age Wanox?
That's why the watchers are always giving me a hard time about you guys and Melchisedic.
Right.
It's what they said.
Don't pull that.
You know it's Melchisedic.
Right.
Melchisedic.
Right.
He's also.
Ahmator.
You don't know these things because you're restricted.
Right.
Do you see?
Do you see everyone?
The Bible studies people, they're restricted.
They restrict themselves.
What I am reading you tonight are the words of the Bacchic prophet, St. John.
Yeah.
Now, which of the St. John's?
There's several St. John's, right there.
This is the one that does all the baptizing.
He's the one within the purple.
The what?
He's a Baptist.
Don't worry.
What are those Baptists carry around?
There's a glass dildo.
Yes.
It's a drinking cup.
Right.

Okay.
Did you see it?
Smell it.
We just got out of the ship and it was like, whoo, this place is first century sewage.
Great.
You know you're in the right place.
Now, what am I giving you to read that prophet, that Bacchic prophet, who I'm going to show
you for the first time.
You're not going to see this anywhere else.
I'm going to show you for the first time what John the Baptist really was.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And you're going to see what kind of person.
You're going to smell him.
You're going to taste him.
Yeah.
Oh, God.
