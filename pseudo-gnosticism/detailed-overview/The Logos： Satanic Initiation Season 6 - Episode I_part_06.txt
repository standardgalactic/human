Look at this.
Enthus.
It's literally people having the divinity inside you, right?
Full of the God inspired or possessed.
Yes.
But look at Roman numeral number two of divine frenzy inspired by the gods.
And you can see the word Monty after it and Montaei rides.
You have that working of the God within when you were at those fumigations, right?
When you were at those fumigations.
What did you do?
What did you do at those fumigations?
No.
Listen.
You said that.
I'm talking to the former head of my department while I was district who said the Romans in
Greece just wouldn't do such things, use drugs.
How do you get that?
No, stay there.
We'll bring you that later.
How do you get there without the drugs?
The fumigations are sitting right in front of you.
They fumigated.
They did this to you.
They did this.
He's already dead.
Fumigations.
Love it.
For those of you who haven't been around, we've been talking about lots of sex drugs and fumigations.
That's what they've got going on.
There are people walking around who've had erections for 48 hours that can't get rid of them.
They're in a psychotic state.
Yes.
You put these people together?
Yes.
You put them into groups and let them dance it out.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
We need to go to a little bit more Greek.
A little bit more Greek.
Pour it on just a little bit.
Look at this one, guys.
I love this one.
Yeah.
What is John doing?
John is raising the Bacchic shout.
He's raising the voice that brings the God.
He is that divine power.
He is that Bacchus.
So that John is given the epithet that we know was given to Heracles.
Why is John like Heracles?
Well, if you're talking about mystery cult and you're talking about the dragon's banquet.
Then you're talking about Highless and Heracles.
And Highless is Heracles' young boy friend.
Yes.
Young boy friend.
And now you understand the baptisms.
Yes.
God.
Fantastic.
Fantastic.
There's always a nymph hidden somewhere, right?
There's always a nymph.
Love it.
Love it.
Did you know John the Baptist was that dirty?
Some of you, I know, are going to write to me in various capacities and you're going to say something about me going to hell or something like that.
And you're going to say it's for bringing such slander to the name of the great and powerful John.
Yes.
The Bacchic.
The Bacchic frenzied drug using child rapist John.
Let me say that one more time.
The drug frenzied child rapist John the Baptist.
It's okay.
Salome.
Salome brought it to an end.
Salome brought it to an end.
You say, well, I thought she was the bad, right?
That's what happens.
She wasn't the bad guy.
All right.
He was.
Things get switched around when the government gets taken over by the minority that is a fundamentalist, wacko bunch of apocalypse bringing, burning down Rome, destroying books and burning bitches.
Did I say I meant witches?
That was excuse me.
