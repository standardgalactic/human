Yeah, let's not get.
Can we, we can't beep that out because it was a slip.
Burning witches, burning witches, the same people.
Bring up the Greek.
I apologize.
That was a complete because, you know, the, the bitches were the people doing the burning.
I know that because I read a text about a woman who was being burned and she was screaming at the people, the Christians watching her as she was being burned.
And she was screaming at them, telling them, I am your punishment.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Love it.
Love it.
Love it.
If you ever get a chance to wave a Fasciam or a phallus in the face of a child molesting priest, you may feel that you've received justice.
I know I did.
I know the entire school did.
It's out there.
Love it.
Bring it up.
Bring it up.
Here we've got another text.
Look at this.
And the light has shined in the darkness.
This is that right?
Your preacher is standing there.
This is John.
The light has shined in the darkness and the darkness does not comprehend the light.
This is the light of Jesus.
Right.
There was a dude, it says in verse six.
There was this dude.
He was sent from God and his name was John.
He came to be a witness.
Give us now what known as tells us what little tidbits.
Can we can we get from this?
Look right at the top.
We've got Zoe again.
We've got that living life that's with embedded within the logos.
Right.
And we've got into this dark fog of death cosmos came this shining guy.
This shining earth shaking glorious light.
Yeah.
The darkness couldn't comprehend it.
The darkness couldn't grasp it.
And there was this dude in this beef feeding little place.
Cops.
They used to call this C O P S C.
Right.
It's a, oh, whatever a grove.
Some kind of grove.
There's trays and bees.
Right.
Beef head.
Isn't that a nice word?
Millie support.
Beef head.
I love that.
Anyway, there's the student there.
This Bakken dude.
Right.
And what is he doing?
He's not even a citizen of where you and I are from.
Right.
He's a citizen of the Ramon.
He is speaking from the Ramon that is hidden within the crack of the rock.
Do you hear me?
This is John speaking to you from the void.
This is John speaking to you.
A herald.
A herald of the first baptism.
A herald of the origin.
His name is John.
The divine breaker of people.
Wait, what?
Wait.
Did you, did you say the breaker of people?
Wait.
What is it?
Is this?
Oh my goodness.
I had it there up until I saw John breaking people.
But we know that he's the Heracles because he's got the title.
And if he's got the title, he's got the high list because everybody knows in the
prior pig poems, you can drink out of the buttocks of Ganymede.
