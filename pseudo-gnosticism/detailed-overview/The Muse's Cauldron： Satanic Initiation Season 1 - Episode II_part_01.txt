We're looking for a harbor.
I thought you were, okay, well now we've got a container.
And from that death containing thing, she brings medicines.
Quote, please.
And the rest of the quote is, and now this is where we buckle your seatbelts.
Okay.
Yeah, what is she doing implicat?
She implicats them to implicat is to engage something in the activity for which it was made.
Yeah, um, um, yeah, to apply.
Yeah, um, she's, she's working over something with these.
Medica Mina, she's, she's applying them somehow.
Um, to what?
To two things.
That's what the quake way does in Latin.
It's beautiful that both this and that bring it up again.
Um, we're going to see us.
Right.
On the one hand, it's her.
We're going to see us that she's applying it to.
And on the other hand, it's her monelae itself.
So the question is, what is she doing?
The word.
We're guineos is obviously, um, from weirdo.
And if I were to ask you now, I'll just lay down the definition for weirdo now.
The definition for weirdo is a girl of marriageable age.
Right.
This is not, this is not virginity as you and I think of virginity.
Right.
So, um, yeah, these, this is an age of priestesses.
Right.
Those virgin priestesses.
That's awesome.
Right.
We build a giant building on top of a hill and we'll put one of these virgins in it.
This giant statue will give her a big spear and your helmet.
Right.
And she'll carry the aegis, the aegis.
What's the aegis?
Oh, it's got a head of a Medusa on it.
Yeah.
It turns you to stone.
Yeah.
You can't the virgin once you get in the virgin's way.
That's it, bro.
Right.
If you're not clean, you, you dead.
Right.
So, um, what does she do?
That's virgin.
Long story short brings the quote.
That's virgin.
I'm going to try to make you taste this text.
I want you to taste it.
Right.
I want you to feel the authenticity.
Nothing else.
You'll see, you'll see.
I feel the authenticity.
So if you can bring up, see us here.
There we go.
And you'll notice.
You'll notice that it's essentially a curve.
Right.

If we didn't have those guys, if we didn't have those dragons, we'd be nowhere.
But if you go, if you go, if that page were back up here, and it's okay, it doesn't need to be.
But if you go to number two, you'll see Eidioion.
Well, what kind of Eidioion? Eidioion Gunagheion.
This word is particularly, this word is particularly the female genitalia.
Okay, bring up the original Latin text, please.
Yep, this one. Oh, beautiful.
Excellent, so thank you very much. I appreciate that.
Monile. Look at Monile.
Yeah, what is a Monile? And it's not just any Monile, it's Monile Ipsum.
Her very what? Her own Monile.
Now, if you look this up, which we can, we can go ahead.
We can show them the extended definition of Monile.
Yeah, look at this necklace or collar, right? Notice that it starts talking about jewels.
But something that you might miss is that this is the Latin Gemma.
And I just want you to keep that in mind.
And look here, we have the relationship to Greek, Mianos, or Mionos, right?
And those are from the word Mianos, and are root for mania, right?
So to be in a state of mania, maniacos, right? Anyway.
So what she's doing, and that fits the text that this is from,
because Medea does this with her body, she does this.
And when she is, when she is done, it says she turns into a fury and runs off.
She runs off and she's ready for battle now.
But she's putting this stuff on her, it's okay, it's okay.
It's on her virgin, on her virgin sinus, a sinus is a sinus.
It's an opening, right? A pocket, right?
A pocket that you could have safe harbor in.
It's the very word for harbor in culpros.
Culpros is means harbor, right?
So we're halfway there, all we need is the dark harbor.
Where is the, where is the darkness?
Yeah.
So, and that's why we need the echidna.
You got to have those viper girls if you're going to have them.
I've got a question name.
Yeah, go ahead.
Can we go back and draw that Alice back up?
The Alice that you just had up.
It says worn by boys, worn by horses.
Blow her down.
What's that mean?
No, no, not that one.
No, not that one.
No, there we go.
There we are.
Yes.
We have boys.
