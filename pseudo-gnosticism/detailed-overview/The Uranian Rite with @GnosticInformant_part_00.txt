Earning the tab.
Something's the little bitch that you give to the goddess.
Athena follows the duciest around.
She makes men fulfill their desires.
To be worth a woman.
Crystal of Aphrodisiac.
Once you are out producing the theory eggs.
Watch out, your brain will open up.
Athena with a purple cup.
Change your world, control the crush.
You begin to face the wrong move.
As you get better seen.
Wish you would.
Change your world, control the crush.
You begin to face the wrong move.
As you get better seen.
Wish you would.
Welcome back to Lady Babylon.
This is Initiating Apocalypse.
What I am going to bring to you tonight
is going to fill you with great joy and appreciation.
I'm going to give you a view that we haven't had before.
And I'm going to bring these texts out to you
and cause you to slip into the state of reality.
I love this stuff.
I love this stuff.
Don't listen.
Don't listen to them.
Right?
That's what I told them.
Don't listen to them.
But they always do.
Wax.
You got to tie yourself down.
You got to put wax in your ears.
Right?
It's one of the two.
Tonight what I'd like to bring you is usual.
We'll look at a couple of Hebrew texts
that took the Greek original
and just slammed it into the ground.
Just cut off every pedal.
All the buds.
Step them off.
All you got is a stem left.
It's got thorns on it.
Tonight we're going to look at a couple more of those examples
because of what we're doing.
I kind of want to give the congregation
the big picture tonight.
What has rankled people
is the revelation of what a Christ is
and the revelation of the naked boy with Jesus
and the revelation that Moses and Yahoo were born
in the third century.
Those are the three things
that really are getting to people.
So I am doing the best job that I can to show you.
And to be honest, it's easy.
It's easy.
Not just because it's the muse,
because the translation into Hebrew from the Greek
is taking a step from 1.7 million, 1.5 million
down to 7,000 unique words.
And that's not a step down.
That's a plummet.
Scholars, scholars can look at the texts.
You can look at the text.
It's the evidence that we have, right?
And the evidence shows us that we are living a lie
and I am here to free you.
I'm here to free you from that lie.
To the reality, which is not always so bright.
It's difficult to tell Muslims, Jews, Christians.
Did you know that your religions descend from rights?
Polytheistic rights, where you all once worshiped
the great Urania.
Yeah, all over the Mediterranean.
She was all over the Mediterranean.
This is Uranian mystery cult that I bring you tonight.
Now, Gnostic is going to come on and look,
and after I'm done with my bit, he's going to come on
and he's going to give you a bit,
and that bit's going to have little bits about madness
from antiquity with sources, right?
Hopefully, we'll supplement each other
with the right material.
It's fantastic.
Look at what we do for you.
That's what we do.
And you don't have to buy a t-shirt.
What is this?
Hail to Urania.
Nice.
Hail to Cleo.
Who is Cleo?
Cleo is the muse of history.
Cleo is the muse of history.
Hail Satan.
We're going to look at her tonight.
Who is Urania?
Who is the muse of Uranus?
Isn't that gorgeous?
All right.
Let's go.
Let's go find the muse.
But in the way, we're going to bump up against this terrible,
laughably bad translation,
and it really makes theologians.
This is the other thing we're doing,
and I just want to remind you this.
So, everybody here at Satanic congregation knows
that I am trying to...
Somebody is trying to set me up, right?
For engagement.
Engagement with great leaders,
intellectual leaders, thinkers.
Yeah.
I don't know if you could call them that.
But it turns out that these people are unwilling to engage
because they are out of their depth and they know it.
Very wisely, they know it.
You find somebody who's capable,
and the head of Dallas Theological Seminary's Greek program,
Dr. Darrell Bock, he's not capable.
Jordan Peterson, incapable.
And why is that, people?
That's only for one reason,
because we follow the muse.
We honor those texts and that evidence.
We use the reason that we've got.
We use it.
We're not looking for Nephilim.
Isn't that nice to be in Satanic congregation
and not have to be looking for Nephilim and alien this...
Oh, God, from Galaxy Z.
Isn't that nice?
We don't have to deal with that.
We don't have to deal with moons that are death stars.
Why?
What keeps us sane here
that seems to permeate the environment around you?
The insanity.
What keeps us sane?
Reason.
Reason.
Nature.
Oh, God.
The great accounting.
There's things that you can look at that just capture your soul.
I'm going to give you some of those tonight.
Are you ready?
Your souls for the people online
who think this is a conspiracy of some sort.
Right?
With the funny things that are coming up.
First of all,
if you're going to do a video,
don't use modern Greek.
Right?
Right?
Right?
Second of all,
there's a lot of state things that are facts
for which you have evidence.
Right?
Those are the...
You're not going to wrestle for long
in the gymnasium of Paideia
if you can't come to grips with that reality.
Okay?
So, everybody seated on the throne.
Seated on the throne.
Let's get our Scythian thing going.
Let's get our Scythian thing up tonight.
And get the perception
of what these words are saying.
They're reaching out to us.
I wanted to put up this comment first.
I wanted to put up this comment.
Focus on this for a second.
These lessons have opened my eyes
to what I've always subconsciously knew.
I love my wife and daughters
even more now than ever.
What has been done to women
by these modest pisses me off
to no end.
I'm glad to be here learning history
and mystery
with all of you beautiful humans.
That's a statement.
Write out.
Write out of an academy.
Write out of a
Renaissance resurgence
of the classics.
Right?
This is what happens.
Opens up.
It opens up the mind.
This is not faith.
This is reason
our universe
is supported by reason.
Not faith.
Faith is what you get from
modest movements.
Yes.
And then you get all sorts of
genocide
and persecution
and torture.
It gets gruesome.
Monism is a terrible,
terrible historical disease
that's going around.
Doesn't have the environment either.
Fantastic.
How do we know this?
Go back to the 14th century.
BC.
And check out what happens
when the monastery
from totally different group
and they don't know any gods you know
blah blah blah.
And you'll see why it's similar.
This is why it's important
that we're sitting here.
We're going to review this
because it was that important.
You who don't like reviews, come here.
By the way, for the guy
who sent me the comment,
