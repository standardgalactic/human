All rise.
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave on the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a star coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed all the way
Why did you ever change your name?
All the way
Why did you ever change your name?
Tonight on Satanic Initiation
We are going to begin the Final Four
These are the Final Four of our series
Let the trial commence
Tonight we will bring the charges
In the case of the Trans-Dimensional Cosmos
Versus Jesus Christ
Tonight on Lady Babylon we are going to
Explore the charges
You will get some instructions
You will be the jury
And we will have a live verdict
From all of you who have been coming here
And putting out your time
We will have jury deliberations
And we will have a verdict
Tonight we begin with Upsilon
We begin with Upsilon
Tonight we jump into the court on Lady Babylon
Tonight we are going to start with a little purification
And this sort of purification I take very seriously
And I hope you do too
Because as we invoke God's
It becomes incumbent upon us to serve that power
Yes, tonight I want to call Decay
I want to call Justice
I want to bring her here to witness this cosmic trial
I want her to be here
And who is she?
I'm going to give you justice
In a few symbols, a few images
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here

Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
Let's bring her here
satanic congregation, understand what we are bound to do.
And we are bound to serve her.
Tonight on Lady Babylon, we are going to go to a place
where there are organized proceedings.
I want to bring you some charges.
Your instructions as a jury are provided in the hymn
that you just saw.
They're provided in the hymn that you just saw.
Maintain this rule for the omadike.
Maintain this rule for her.
Stand this ground for justice.
Let's do it.
Let's do it.
I want to begin by announcing some charges.
These are the charges.
There are six of them.
And you will be determining whether or not Jesus Christ
is guilty of all six charges.
I'm going to read these out.
Please note, this is an official record.
Charge number one, jury.
Hit it.
Aggravated psychic battery.
Aggravated psychic battery.
You are to determine if, in the course of events,
a psyche was set upon and battered in an aggravated manner,
in a manner to cause gross, gross, and irreversible psychic
harm.
Thank you, Chewie.
Number two, please.
What else?
Now, technically, these next two charges
are kind of a bundle.
You know, we need a commentator here
to tell us what we have instead is the authority
bringing the charges.
The transdimensional criminal conspiracy
is a plurality that is working together
within a racketeering force.
That's why the next charge is necromantic racketeering,
a very specific form of racketeering,
involving necromantic practices, resurrections
from the dead.
Death states the casting out of the forces of nature,
i.e. demons, the healings, and the bringing of life.
These are all necromantic practices
that we are going to show are used within a scheme of racketeering
on those two charges, the second and third charge.
Thank you.
Can you present the next apocalyptic assault?
And this isn't just felonious assault.
This is assault in the cosmic first degree.
Yes, this is an extra chronic assault.
We have to show intent.
We have to show purpose.
We have to show that there was something achieved outside
of time, first degree.
We have to show that the noose, the mind,
was outside of Kronos.
Fantastic.
Let's go to the next one.
Quantum obstruction of justice.
This one's pretty self-explanatory.
People get this one.
We as prosecutor of this case, we tend to bring that out.
It's my plan to bring that out.
