I will show you.
It's my job.
However, this is just the announcement of the charges.
Quantum obstruction of justice.
Yes, anytime, anytime within the cosmic court,
anytime that you have an obstruction of justice,
you're dealing with a matter that is always
taken to the nth degree.
We know the mandatory sentencing laws
that apply, of course, to quantum obstruction.
They're pretty severe.
So this is a very serious charge,
why we're dropping it down here.
And finally, what we find the most egregious
is this false ionic imprisonment.
This is a contrary to one's will holding.
This is a forcing someone outside of the chronic stream
to be bound.
Yes.
It is a form of trafficking.
It falls within the trafficking laws
of the last 12th dimensional contract, I think it was.
Anywho, false ionic imprisonment.
And you'll see.
These are the charges.
And what we have to do is we have
to bring the jury the proper evidence.
We don't want you to come to conclusions
without the evidence.
This is why our jury system is so superior.
It's so superior, right?
Can you smell that ancient courtroom with 300 jurors
and Athens?
And they're all screaming, sweaty, and moving around.
Right?
It's like a mob.
Mob jury, right?
Love it from that mob.
We'll boil up, because our citizens are our citizens.
You people know who you are.
And I know there are factions that you want me to appeal to.
In this case, you want me to.
I invite the evangelical community.
I invite you to defend your guy.
Yes, we're not going to stifle anybody's.
We don't have to worry about people outside the courtroom.
We don't have to worry about terrorism.
We've got all of that clamped down.
Don't worry.
It's brought together in a very specific place.
Love it.
Let's go tonight.
Now that we've had a little bit of the justice,
and we're going to revisit these charges at the end.
Now that we've had a little bit of justice,
I want to bring you to the place.
I want to slow down a little bit, bring you to the Upsilon.
I want to bring you to the Upsilon.
In order to get there, we're going to start here.
Alice, first of all, can you tell us, Alice,
who is this justice, this DK?
What kind of God do we have in our presence tonight?
We're just going to talk about the judge for a minute.
Are you ready?
She's the Avenger.
DK is the Avenger.
She's also the Executioner.
And he's a little bit of goofiness of history.
Look at number three.
It says that she is also the Coneon.
This is how it refers to her, is the Timoros.
She is the Coneon.
What is that?
That's your hemlock, baby.
That's the stuff the state uses to put you into the ground.
But you can see people.
Take it down for a second.
I want to give you some of the reality congregation.
You can see people coming out of taverns on it,
on it, stumbling around.
Now, because it's only lethal at a certain dosage.
That's the game you're playing in antiquity.
It's only lethal at a certain dosage.
So you can take a little bit of hemlock.
A little bit of hemlock goes a long way.
And how do you treat somebody who's had too much
and they're finally losing it and they're walking around.
You keep slurring their words.
What do you do with them?
You take them down.
You give them X, Y, and Z. You can bring them out of it.
Fantastic.
That's who she is, right?
She is that Avenger.
She is that Avenger.
Justice in this.
I thought you said justice and vengeance.
They don't go together.
And no, no, it turns out justice is vengeance.
Oh, I see your cosmos.
Is that why he was saying?
Is that why he was saying it's not my cosmos?
Yeah, it's not.
It's a satanic cosmos.
Can you smell it tonight?
You're going to satanic cosmos.
And in that cosmos, DK is in charge.
She looks from that throne.
Let those who have ears to hear hear.
She looks from that throne.
Yeah.
And what does she do?
She comes right down on the unjust.
Boom.
Oh, don't you like that?
I think she's a little Amazonian.
Do you, Chewy?
She smells a little Amazonian to me.
I bet she would.
Yeah, I'm starting to like justice.
She's going to inspire some statues over time.
And you're going to see her, right?
But tonight, in satanic initiation,
you need to see her straight up front,
or we're not going anywhere.
This is a nice place.
Can I just sit here for a minute?
Leave that out.
Oh, if I were there, I would dance.
I would dance some kind of, I don't know, maybe a tango,
or something like that.
Oh, that's gorgeous.
OK, let's go back to the texts and the sources.
I want to bring up tonight the tail end of what
