Let the sea be calm.
This is holy silence.
This is the theosos of the muses.
This is the theosos.
Yeah, the commission tonight,

I am talking to my satanic congregation.
You know who you are.
Sit back down.

You know who you are.
This, I just want you to revel in the beauty
of this theosos.
Can you feel where we are?
Is this the most stimulating that we can get?
This is just the beginning.
This is what we have been given.
What's going to happen?
