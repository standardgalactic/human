I've already blown it.
Go to that one.
Thanks.
We'll show you the theosos, right?
What's happening in our town?
What's happening?
The altars are full.
Who am I now?
Who am I now?
I switched from Aristophanes and inside comes Escalus.
Oh, God.
Is this the, is this the altars?
Yeah, the altars.
What are they doing?
They're burning with the gifts.
What kind of gifts?
Amen.
Tell me the gifts of all the gods of the city,
the gods above, the gods of the Kthon,
the gods of Uranos.
These are the gods that we're talking about.
The altars are burning.
And what happens?
Can you hear what happens?
Look at the bottom here.
Oh, ale de alos en urano meches.
These lights, this flame is coming up from the altars.
It's coming up in every part of the city.
It's going right up to Uranos.
It's going what?
Right up to Uranos.
What's happening?
Look, we're modern, so I'm sorry.
Let me explain.
The altars, they're all burning,
and the place is fumigating itself.
Isn't that nice?
You can walk around the streets and be fumigated
in a very positive way.
This is fantastic.
Give me that next one.
Yeah, yeah.
Did we miss it?
Did you, you're going to hit one of these asteroids,
and that's going to be it.
What happens to these fumes?
Good job, Chewie.
What happens?
Farmaso meni.
Farmaso meni.
What do they do, these offerings to the gods?
They drug us.
They drug us.
They drug us.
Isn't this nice?
You thought you knew the reality.
Did you know you could walk around an ancient city
and get high just by walking in the streets?
Isn't that strange?
Wow.
What geniuses these are.
This is amazing work.
Yes, please.
And what does it mean?
Blow it up, Chewie.
What does it mean?
Oh, look at this, to heal.
This could be a healing, people.
But look at number two.
This is my favorite.
Listen to these Victorians.
This is an enchantment or bewitchment
by potions or filters.
Wait a minute.
The first time I read that, I thought,
is this Disney World?
Where am I?
Yeah, if I wished on a star, look at the potions
and the filters here, to bewitch.
You know what it means to bewitch?
That's when I give you a drug that makes you want to have
sexy time.
Yeah, isn't that something?
Did you know we have a lot of accounts of ancient women
drugging men into sexy time?
Isn't that interesting?
Wow, you didn't think it was so exciting and antiquity,
but it was.
It was.
You could get abducted in the street
and taken somewhere and have things done to you.
And a couple of weeks later, you'll
remember little flashbacks to you.
Fantastic stuff, man.
You've got to roll with these witches.
Why are there no witches anymore?
The witches out there doing the wicked stuff.
How watered down has your existence become?
Are you not up to the task that your mothers and grandmothers
were?
My goodness, it's amazing.
I brought my nice vest tonight.
Let's go to the next one.
This is gorgeous.
How do you like it?
I didn't even talk about getting off the bus.
Look, we're already there.
Look, people.
Now, who am I talking to?
Euripides.
Speak up, Euripides.
What does Euripides say?
Look, there's this servant.
And she's a nurse.
And she says, hey, I've got the drugs that you need, baby.
You need a Thelteria erotos.
Oh, god.
I need one of those.
I need one of those.
Doesn't it?
It sounds really neat, doesn't it?
Thelteria erotos.
What is that?
She says, look, I've gotten a house, a filter, a drug,
a sex drug, specifically.
It's going to heal all your problems.
Thank goodness for erotos, baby.
We don't worship erotos anymore.
They destroyed his temple.
Shui, the second they came into the action,
you know who did it.
I don't have to say it historically.
You know who destroyed the temple of erotos?
Now all we have left is the choir, this choir of frustrated.
I'm sorry.
Sisters, forgive me.
Sisters of frustration.
May you ultimately climax.
Fantastic.
Blessings.
Blessings on you.
Go to the next one.
The next slide, yeah.
No, no, no, back, back, back.
We've got to show them.
I just want to show them these.
