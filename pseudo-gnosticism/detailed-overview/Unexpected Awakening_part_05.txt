Have you done that?
Now you know why he's got the 12 kids with him all the time.
Right?
It's in his ministry.
Love it, right?
Okay, go to the next one.
Keep going.
We're on a hot streak.
People, I want you to feel the energy off this thing.
Look at this.
Look, wait, what?
I thought, isn't that Ewangelia, right?
Or as the nerd seminary and say Ewangelia, right?
Right, sounds like something.
Anywho, this is the gospel.
The gospel.
Yeah, yeah.
It's the gospel of what?
What kind of gospel?
It's all about Ionic Zoe.
All about Ionic Zoe.
You feel good with that?
Okay, here we go.
Here we go.
What is an Ewangelia?
What is an Ewangelia?
You'll say it's a gospel.
Yeah, yeah.
Okay, hold on to your pants.
Because an Ewangelia is a term
that is used in the medical side.
And it's a term that's used for the promise
of the drug for salvation, the promise.
And you wondered, oh, everybody's sitting around saying,
I like the heat over on this side.
Everybody's sitting around saying, hey, hey, what?
You know, what is it?
Well, what is this thing?
It's all chemical.
It's all chemical.
The Christos, the gospel.
Those are all chemical processes.
Oh, God, it's starting to get me kind of a natural high.
You know what I mean?
Like nature makes you high, you know?
Oh, God, genius.
It's because the genius.
You just have to see the genius.
And yeah, they'll eventually catch up.
Maybe the stuff will get studied.
Somebody will find some great medicine.
As a matter of fact, I can smell that.
I can smell it coming, right?
Oh, God, he cheats, right?
Let's go to the next.
Go to the next.
Ooh, don't you love?
Boy, by the way, Chewy, big thanks to Chewy
for all the graphics and just making the ship fly.
You do an outstanding job, you know what I mean?
And I want to say thank you.
Let's go.
Look, people, Chewy brought us the thing
we were looking for before.
The curative property claimed for prescriptions
or drugs, yeah, they're advertised.
And he didn't mean, or whoever did this particular entry,
they didn't mean advertised like commercials, right?
These are the claims that are made on the drug
that this drug will do X, Y, and Z.
You didn't know that they were calling Jesus
the divine physician, the great physician.
You didn't know that they were doing that
because they had been doing that for a long time.
Wow, centuries of this stuff, people, right?
The divide is history took a detour and was rewritten.
It was rewritten by, get this,
relish factions of zealots, right?
This is not the average religious process.
These are zealots who did this to rewrite our history.
We didn't know, people here, now this is becoming
quite an interest, people are asking me in interviews.
What is it with these, with these,
the date of the Old Testament?
What is it with the fact that the thing may actually
be in Greek and it has nothing to do with Hebrew
and that Hebrew is a fabrication.
It's a resurrection of a dead language
that didn't do anything while it was alive.
And we have these all over the Mediterranean.
They usually just disappear, yeah, swallowed up
by the monstrous Amazon of ancient Greek.
If you haven't looked at her,
if you haven't looked at that queen,
oh God, let's bring more over here.
You know what we're gonna do tonight?
Leave her up there for just a second.
Thank you for the decency crosses.
Those are sponsored by the head
of the Sisters of Frustration.
Thank you.
Yes, look, oh, what is that by the way?
Is that a, is that a bird?
Talk of it, she's kind of like Snow White,
you know what I mean?
Yeah, talking to the birds.
Go to the next one.
Oh, love this, love this.
No, not your next one.
I meant my next one.
Thanks, thanks, Joey.
Don't get, you got a big head.
Now that I complimented you, you got a big head.
Okay, look, look, kitties.
It's the final days.
It's the ending, it's the completion.
And as you've heard, there are gonna be lots of,
look at the second line, first, second word in.
Antichristos, Antichristos.
What do you think an Antichristos is?
It's a drug that is an antidote to a Christ.
Do you know that's what they're saying
when they're saying Antichrist and Antiquity?
They're saying antidote.
Yeah, do you know what cancels the Christ,
the Antichristos?
It's a medical concept.
It's a medical concept.
Look, not only do you have to use drugs if you're Jesus,
but you've gotta use drugs if you're Jesus's followers.
If you don't, if you don't,
you don't have any place with him.
Yeah, I know, I know, I know.
But you don't know all things, right?
Who wants to know all things anyway?
Who wants their eyes to be open?
Wow, you'd be just like him.
And if you were Yahoo, you'd screw everything up.
Yeah, let's go back to the sources here.
People are like, I don't have time for this.
Let's go, I feel it.
Yeah, yeah, and you, you know what I mean?
Okay, now listen to this.
This is the creepy instructions.
And I say creepy only very, you know,
it takes a lot to creep me out, right?
