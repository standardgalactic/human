You're gonna love it
Hail Satan, get your sum
Poisonous venom cup
Hot purple, sip it up
That girl you know you love
Satanic initiation
In the park
After dark
Creepy stuff
In the garden of Gethsemane
Accomplices, prostitutes
And accountants
Where the necromancers hang out
And get high
With Lady Babylon, no doubt
Purple facial
Of seashells, semen
Opients in adrenal chrome
The dark lord of Saturn
Satan's palimpsest
An eerie tale of sinister doom
Hail Satan, get your sum
Poisonous venom cup
Hot purple, sip it up
That girl you know you love
Hail Satan, get your sum
Poisonous venom cup
Hot purple, sip it up
That girl you know you love
Hail Satan, get your sum
Poisonous venom cup
That girl you know you love
Babylon
We're going to take one step deeper
Into the apocalypse
Are you ready?
Are you ready for this?
I dressed for the occasion
I have tickets
I have tickets tonight
Just for you and me
Now
A few string
Pulling
The tickets
So, where am I going to be able to take you
I just want you to know
The devil is giving us the pass
We can go right to the right
We can go right there
We can get ready
To profane it all
Get ready to bring it out
I have got to warn you tonight
I have a text
That will make you
Tense up
It'll make you tense up like that
Some smooth muscle action
It's going to make you tense up
Yep
Almost like there's a demon there
Oh my god
You're going to love it tonight
I get to take you to a place
A lot of people don't get to access this
Right
What's he doing
He's bringing us into the mood
Well, the ship
Takes us there
In time and space
You and I are going to infiltrate
Tonight
You and I are going to infiltrate
I want
Before we start
I just want to take us to a place
I want you to
I just want you to have some
Inspiration
For the rest of our journey
And I want to warn you
I know that I've warned you in the past
But tonight I'm warning you
This material is
Radioactive
You may walk away
From this
Regretting
That you saw it
For those of you
Who are starting to get that little nausea
Buckle up because here it comes
I'm bringing you the sources
This is necromancy
101 tonight
And I'm bringing you the sources
You're going to love this
Hold your stomachs
Because we're going right
Into the heart
What do we have tonight
We have a Christian mystery
Before we take you
Into the Christian mystery
In a
First-hand account
There's drugs
There's drugs
And there's babies
Drugs and babies
And a lot of blood
A lot of blood
Wow
It's an historical text
Kiddies
Let's go look at it tonight
First
Looking to the goat
Thank you very much
Everyone
Who brought this
Hit it Chewie
Hit my goat
Everybody look at my goat
That hits my goat
Hit my goat
Hit my goat
I want to bring to you
I want to bring to you
Bring to you the confusion
I want to bring to you
The confusion
The memoir
Okay here it comes
Are you ready?
Nice
I don't want to steal the authenticity
That we do not
Accept any sort
Of cash
Or any sort
Of gold or silver
Or currency
Or glitch
Of electric space
That's the task
Nobody gets in the door
