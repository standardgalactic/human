You ever seen any growths on him
Interesting
Yeah
Wow
You mean there's
Applications to this? Yeah
Yeah
We have lost
A thousand years
Of scientific development
We've lost it
The
Favor
That Christianity did
Western civilization
Was
To mute
And to retard
Our
Scientific progress
I will remind you
As the devil
Is always harping
I'll remind you
It's not
It's about power
And the enemy
Of democracy
Will always
Masquerade as its
Greatest champion
They'll rewrite history
Right in front of your eyes
Aren't you glad to be alive this year
Aren't you glad
It's lovely
Sorry
I'm getting so excited
Let's do the next text. These people
These are all professionals, man. These people
Need
Time and space to get things worked out
Right? So look, they collect them
And they put the
Blood into the vials
Next one, please
And
I just want you to see
That one of the things that they're cutting
They call the sarchia
Of these children
That are
Defection
And forcefully delivered
And then subjected to the burning
Subjected to the burning
And when the mothers see it
They're always like, no!
Right?
They're like, no!
What are you doing?
You know? And that's why
We have the Ellicinian
Mysteries
You didn't realize that?
Demyphon
They're doing the same thing
The Christians
Oh
Their entire history
To the Greek Mysteries
There wouldn't be anywhere
Mustadion is a Greek word
Right?
There's no Hebrew around at the time, people
Put your storybook down
Charlton Heston's dead
Fantastic
Fantastic
Let's go to the next
What is this little piece of flash?
Go back
People, I was showing them baby flash
What do they cut of the children?
What do they cut?
They cut the sarchion
Well, it's a diminutive of sarx
Why didn't you just say sarx?
Which would mean flash?
Yeah, why didn't you just say that?
I want you to look at Roman numeral number two
This is bits of flash
Bitty bits
Okay, fine, look at number two
They're purple
Numfe
Uh-oh
I hear nymph
Everybody loves nymphs, don't they?
If they don't, they need more goat time
Whoever does not love nymphs
Needs goat time
Give me the next one
What is our nymph here? Blow it up, Chewy
Check this out, people
I want you to see it's a young wife, bride
Marriageable maiden
Young girl
Yeah, take it down
Give me the next one
What else is a nymph?
Oh, you see, a nymph is a huge
concept in Antimune
This can be an actual force of nature
that you have to deal with
You ever deal with a nymph?
You know what they always do? Nymphs
Right, first of all, always beautiful
Right, get a shout out to all the nymphs out there
Um, gorgeous
Especially those tree nymphs, man
You gotta give it to them
You know, but what do they do?
They do things like
drown you in a sexual frenzy
Right
Oh, seriously?
Where do you think Heracles, boy, went?
Right?
Where do you think
he ended up?
Yeah, he ended up in the arms of a nymph
Isn't that how it is, Addis?
Put your privates away, Addis
And then they
cut them off
Isn't that funny?
Oh, nymphs
Nymphs, you better have a crowd of people
with you if you're ever around
the nymphs
Yes, read more
Goat time, more goat time
Hit it
Hit the goats again
Oh, bring it, I can feel it
Can we get my goat?
Can we get my goat?
Where's my goat?
