So all of a sudden Paul, thank Paul.
And when he talks about, wait a minute, creation and all things are created through him and
by him and for him.
Wait a minute.
Where did he get that phrase?
We're about to see.
Let's look a little bit further.
Look on the one, two, three, fourth line down on the second line.
You'll see Urania as the first.
Yeah.
As the first word.
Right.
This is Urania.
So you know where we are.
You're always bombarding me with, with, with stuff about Aphrodite and Adonis and, and,
and Cyprus, you know, which we should go to someday.
Yes.
But, but here's Urania.
So now you know who she is.
Look at that fourth line down.
The first word.
Panto Cratera.
Right.
She is that Panto Crator.
She is that one who, who forges all.
Right.
Yes.

He didn't never use the phrase eternal life.
He used the phrase Ionic life.
Right.
Look, look what she is here.
She is that eternal life.
She is that eternal life.
I am the way, the truth and the life.
