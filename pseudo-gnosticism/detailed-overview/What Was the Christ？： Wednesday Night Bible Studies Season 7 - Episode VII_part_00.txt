One more round.
Why did you ever change your name?
Because you were like a wave
On the ocean
Wild and free you came
And you were like a storm
Coming out of mountains
Never to be tamed
All the way
Why did you ever change your name?
All the way
Why did you ever change your name?
Welcome back to the final
Lady Babylon Bible Studies
Part of the series
This is the final episode, people
I am so happy to have you here tonight
And I am so grateful for your attention
And your time
We've got quite a finale episode coming
Let me just tell you what we're going to do
Tonight we're going to walk you up
Right up to Jesus Christ
And we're going to look right into Jesus Christ
Without any covering
Tonight we get to see what's on the under
After that we will have our jury
And you, you congregation of Satan
You will be the ones to decide
We'll take a poll
The majority is the decision of decay
The decision of justice
And then after that
I will say a few words of appreciation
And tell you what's coming
There's a little twist
Something's coming
Everything is coming
Tonight on Lady Babylon
As the space time ship warms up tonight
And we get transported to that place
I want to take you to the encoded reality
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you the images and the ideas
That brand this idolatry
I'm going to show you in silence
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic

I'm going to show you through Chewie's magic
