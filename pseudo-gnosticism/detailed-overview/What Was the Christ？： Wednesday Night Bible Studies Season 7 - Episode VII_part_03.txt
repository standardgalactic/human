create a story to support the supremacy of whatever it is that their national interests are. So
it's almost like the scholarship is attacked. The sources are attacked. And the Greeks and the
Romans, they respond, we're here. That was a long story. But let's bring in Seraph. And let's ask him,
let's put him through some questions. Tell me, buddy, where did you get your stuff from? Were
your sources from the Bronze Age? When Moses was living? No, they weren't, they were contemporary,
Sophia. Isn't that nice? Isn't that nice? It's glorious. It's glorious. Yeah, this is Sophia,
we're talking about. What does she do? What does she do? She brings you her soul. She brings you
her soul to show it, to show it in the middle of the people. What praise, what praise for her soul,
the soul of Sophia. Are you there? Are you there? Do you feel like you've been there?
Do you feel like you've seen her? Remember, we're still with Dameter. We're still with Dameter. We
didn't leave our event. Let's go to the next one. Boom. Oh, people. Whoops. Yeah, I'm so, what does
Sophia do? Look, people, and the native Greek here is so overpowering. It's just the technical
capacity is you can't, people. You got to go out in the desert with a bunch of crazy monks. And you
got to then take your Greek text and try to deconstruct a Hebrew out of it. But the problem is,
again, 8,000 words doesn't cut it. So the text ends up sounding like you're deficient. Deficient
somehow. Yeah, straight up, straight up deficient, people. Look at the text. Look at the Greek. Oh,
God, don't you love philology? You could, oh, you could, you could just snuggle up right up next to
philology and say, honey, I love you so much. Look at this. What is going on? Remember the
skin's gland? You remember the tent where we were? Does that, does anybody, look,
did anybody come back from that thing and wake up and remember that skin's gland from the
scanate? What is, what does she do? Sophia does this on the high, on the high. She does it in
those high places. You know what I'm talking about. A few ladies, a few menads, you know what I'm
talking about. Sophia's out there. She's the leader of the chorus. Isn't that nice? The leader of the
chorus up in the heights. That's why Jehovah is always pissed off saying, destroy all that stuff on
the heights. I'm going to be Mr. Hoopsie Stoss. Right? And he takes over. Damater says, no, I don't
think so. Yahoo. Take a hike. Watch this. Oh, where's your throne, Sophia? Where's your throne,
Damater? It's in a pillar of cloud. It's in a pillar of clouds,
pillar of clouds. Now, for those of you who follow the fairy tale, who are on that pathway,
right? For those of you, this is when there's a giant,
who comes from the space down to the planet. Sometimes it's a who, a fire, a burst of fire,
a whirlwind. Oh, yes. And sometimes it's a cloud. And inside that is the shyna glory beaming out.
And we're in there. We've got our things on our chest. They got a rope on our legs so they can
pull us out if we're dead. Oh, voice of God. Bunch of droggies. Yes. And those of you with ears to
hear, understand the thronos and what it is. My throne says, Sophia is in a pillar of smoke.
My, my throne is a pillar of smoke. You want to know what they were doing there?
Wake up. Wake up from the fairy tale. Get to the anthropology. Do you see the rights that are going
on? How do you think you're going to get to that oracle without drugs? I'm going to show you the
text. Right now, I'm going to lead you right there. So forget about it. Let's just go every,
up the hill. We're going, going to see Demeter right now. I don't care if you guys are ready or
not. Let's go. Go back to Sophia. Sophia, can you give us any more advice? Yeah, Sophia says,
look, I was alone. I was the one encircling Uranus. Oh, we had that circuit down. That was me, says
Sophia. And you know what I do? Listen to this. Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, open your ears.
She walks in the depths of the abyss. Wait a minute. You wanted to see her, didn't you? You
wanted to see the Korah. You wanted to see her. Didn't you want to find the morning star? Jesus,
it's standing here without clothing. Are you ready? Let's focus in. Let's take it in. Look,
let's get close. Are you ready? Give me the, go ahead. Give me the next one, Chewie.
In that skeiné. In that holy skeiné. Do you know what our tent is? It's a holy place. All right.
And when we go in there, who do we have? I have you and you have me. Yeah. Yeah. And
if you're of the persuasion of Heracles, you can substitute her for him. Substitute. But,
you have to castrate. And if you don't, that angel will come after you. Yes. Yes. Okay. I think
I'm there. I think I'm there. Is everybody on the throne? Is everybody on the throne? Do we have
the stars? Do we have the stars in our hand? In that holy, holy tent, what does she do? She performs
her service. She performs her service right in front. Right in front of us. Right in front. Do
you see Sophia performing her service right in front of us? This is that working that brings us
the mystery. This is that working that brings us the mystery. Chewie, back to the text.
Please. Okay. One more. One more. What, what am I smelling and breathing people? It's all over
your clothes. Right? Snappy, you got your clothes are starting to, you're getting stuff on them.
What is that stuff? What is that stuff? What is that stuff? Look at this. What is that?
What are they using these crazy people? This is a shrub. It's guess to be something of a
Cassia sort. Okay. Little thorny shrub thing. And what's next? Another one? Another shrub.
Right? What is she going to do? What is Sophia going to do? She's going to give off,
all Smith, a perfume, a fragrance, a fragrance. Are you in the tent with me? Yes, dear. I'm with you
in the tent. May I say that you are giving off a lovely fragrance, a lovely fragrance. Is everybody
there? Don't watch out. Get your splash guard on for the myrrh. Oh, you're going to love it. You're
going to love it. That's Smirna though. It's going to make you look funny. Let's go. Atraskins love
this stuff, by the way. What else do they, what else are these freaks using? Look at the second
line. Who else had the chosen Smirna? Who else had the chosen? Who else has the chosen Smirna?
