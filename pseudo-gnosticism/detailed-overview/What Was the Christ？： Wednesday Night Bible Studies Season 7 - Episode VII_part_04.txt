Who has the globs of stuff on his face when he's all confused and stoned at four a.m. in a garden
with a naked boy? Who else has that? Who else has that? That's what he's got on his face. Do you
know why? I'm going to show you. I'm going to show you. Let's go. Hang on. I just want you to see.
A couple more plants. These are all resinists, producers of resins. Calbane, right? Onyx,
Stakte. These are all resin slash drug producing plants. And what is happening in the very bottom?
Look, there's an op-ness. An op-ness. You mean in the Bible it talks about the op-ness? Yes. Yes.
What is that? You remember that cloud? This is vaporization or fumigation. What do you do in
a skein, eh? Yeah. You breathe the vapors. You breathe those fragrant vapors. That is how we
transit. That's how we transit. Does everybody know where you are? Does everybody know? Where is
Jesus? Don't lose sight of Jesus while we transit through the vapors. Go. Go. He's real. Yeah. He's
real. Look at this. Smurna. I just want you to see. Okay. It's the gum of the Arabian tree,
right? Smurna. But keep looking down. Look, it's used as an unguent or a sav, right? It's used as
a sav. Also used as an incense. I just want you to see. Take it down. I just want you to see the
level of diversity that we've got going on here. You can take these drugs and you can turn them
into stuff. You can put all over your skin. You can put all over your skin. You can put on different
parts of your body. You can put on different parts. You can buy the form that will vaporize that you
can sit. Ah, you can breathe it in. Love it. Love it. Do you see what we're doing here in the world
setting up the mystery? Do you see this is where Judaism and Christianity come from? From the
Da Maitre. So just relax for a minute. It's going to get uncomfortable here. I'm going to turn up
the tweaking. We're going to transit. It's going to make people uncomfortable. Go to the next one,
please. Boom. Stakhti. Yeah, look, oil of myrrh, specifically oil of myrrh. And I just want you
to see at the bottom. Hey, Tom, friend on Stakhti, right? What is this thing governed? What does it
do? Remember, a lot of these oils are involved in your mental state. That's all I want you to
notice. I want you to notice these things can change. They can transform in a healing way. You
didn't think we're going to come here without ending up at a giant hospital. Did you full of
healing people? It's the way things are, right? Next one. Go to the next one. Boom. Look at this.
What is your op-ness? I just wanted you to see I'm not making this up, people. I'm not keyboard
I'm not making it up. I want you to see. Look at number three. It can be just a poultice. It can
be just a poultice, but properly, it's a moist vapor or steam. Moist vapor or steam. So you see
how the drugs work. They work, you know, there's different preparations that you can use. You're
not going to take the one in the rectum that you're going to take in wine, right? No, because those
are two different portals. Yes. Yes. The ones that go there don't work when they go in there.
Yes. It's very, come on, people. It's a civilization. Don't you love it? Look at the bottom. Spinther
and Apowgasma. Oh, what is that? Spinther. That's the spark of the lightning, baby. Oh,
really? Yeah. You know that purple bolt? It's the spark. How are we going to get there? In our fumes.
In our fumes. Don't worry. It's what the fumes are for. Just trust. What is this Apowgasma? Go to
the next one. What is this? Let's just pick this up quickly. Look. Oh, radiance. Radiance
from a luminous body. Do you have a luminous body? Do you have a luminous body? Look at your dog
stuff sitting there. Oh, God, that feels good. Luminous body. That's what we need. We need to
get to that luminous body. Is everybody, is anybody else seeing this? It's kind of, I don't know,
it's getting me going. Next one in an academic kind of way. It's, you know, turning me on metaphorically.
Smurnecidrota. What is that? That, people. Look, I just want to introduce you. Look, we happen to
be in a back alley now. We're not quite to the temple yet, but I want you to see. Look, somebody
buys some hudrota smurnec. Just trust me. Just do this. Do this. And you're going to find it with
the woman who's called the lover of tears. Lover of tears. You mean Mary the Magdal? The maga
is going to be the one to sell me that? Yes. Yes. Oh, isn't that nice? I love that. I love that. How
old is Mary, by the way? I don't think she's as old as you think she is. This is that sweat. You
know what Jesus has on his face? Jesus, come here. Why is your hudros? Why does it look like
what it looks like? What have you been doing? Let's see. You can look at a person's face and
see what they've been doing. Did I miss it? There's this one. Yeah. So here's Jesus
in the throes of his stonedness, right? And who are we seeing? We're seeing Jesus stoned
right here. He's right in that agonia. He's right in that agonia. And he is stretched out.
He is stretched out in that phase. And what is he doing? He's doing what we all do.
He is sending that voice to the daimones, to the powers. He's praying. And what is he? Oh,
not like that kind of prayer. No, no, no. This is a prayer in the grips of the agonia that you get
from the dipsass, right? Because we know that's what your drug is, Jesus, isn't it?
What's wrong with your hudros, Jesus? It looks like you got clotted blood
on your face. He came out of this. Remember, I told you, take it down. I told you there were
two routes that we could take to daimete. I told you, I told you, we can go the route
with the medwa or we can substitute Addis. It's up to you. Heracles chose Addis. That was his
direction. All those temples set up. Get your mind out of the myth. I'm not talking mythology.
The temples that are set up in honor of Heracles and his mystery,
yeah, only boys, only boys with one exception. Do you know who the one exception is? Who's the
one person they let in? Who's not a boy? It's that other option. It's the medwa. She's the one who
produces it. And you say, why is she special? Why is the daimete special? Why is the virgin special?
What does she have? What does she have? Let's see. And in order to do so, we've got to strip Jesus.
We've got to take him. We've got to take his clothes off. Jesus, I'm sorry. You're going to have to
