Cura. Do you see that? Cura. That's a girl. That's a girl. A child nourishing girl.
You mean Jesus was a cura? Jesus was a girl? The morning star has to be. Has to be. But wait.
Don't, don't get everything in a bind. Because the morning star is the paido file. The paido file.
You can see the root for child. You see our pie on the front of that. Yeah. And file. Okay. Remember
Jesus and Peter having their philotic dysphagia.
I told you. I told you to secure him, didn't I?
Should we let Jesus up for two minutes and he ran amok? Are we back? Is everybody back? Fantastic.
Let's bring back our paido file. We're not letting that happen, Jesus, right?
If you're out there and you're an evangelical and you pray really hard right now. Pray really hard
to shut this down. Because now is the time that I'm going to show you what's under Jesus' skirt.
Are you ready? Go, go. Give it to us. Give it to us. The paido, paido file. Yep. There it is.
Paido file. That's what she is. What was Mary? She was the Theotokos. She was the what?
She was the Theotokos. Do you know what that means? It means the one who produces the goddess.
The one who produces the goddess. She was a cura. She has to be a cura. What do you do with her?
You cut off her testicles. You cut off her testicles.
And she becomes the cup. The cup of your salvation. The cup that brings you healing.
The cup that takes away your woe. The cup that is that portal. That portal to the future. That's
the cup that she brings. She is that oracular source. Do you mean Jesus was that oracular Christos?
Now you hear it. Now you hear it. Are you ready? Are you ready? Go, go, go, go to the next. Boom,
boom. What is a paido file? Uh-oh. It's a paideraste. What is a paideraste? Please hit it.
Paideraste is a lover of boys. Mostly in a bad sense.
Wait, can we just enjoy this moment brought to you by Victorian England.
And welcome to the Queen's Privy Council. Now, what have you found, sir?
Paideraste, my queen. It appears as a lover of boys.
I hope that's mostly in a bad sense. Yes, don't get excited, grandma. Put your shorts back on.
Knickers. Do they call those knickers? Oh my god. Is this supposed to be like that? Here, okay.
Take it away. Take it away. Take that pedarast away. Go down. Jesus has to be the paideraste.
Why do you think he's saying I'm not a laestace? What do you think he's saying I'm not a trafficker?
What do you think? Because dude, that's him. He's supposed to be that one. And they know it.
They know it. We're like, we understand what you're doing, Jesus, and who you're casting out.
We understand. We understand the power of it. We know. And who is that you say?
What did he do? No, it wasn't. None of it was.
Seriously? Yeah. Seriously. Let's go to the next one. Let's go to the next one. You look at this
language of people. Oh, God. It's lovely. It's lovely. What? Great.
Please tell us how we're going to approach your temple. You and I are standing.
We're standing at the very portal, the very gateway to get in, to get in. And who's standing there?
Who's standing there? Dragons. What does she use? She uses dragons. You have to be able to master
that skill. You have to have those dragons. Macrovious. What does Macrovious tell us? The
dragons, they're temple guardians. Yeah, they're temple guardians. Are you ready? You ever seen a
dragon? You ever seen a dragon? You better be ready to hold that dragon up on a stick.
You better be ready to hold them up because you're not going to get any healing otherwise.
That junky Moses who stole his name from the muses, that character invented in the third century,
that character was the theft of the muse. We will put down this lie of history. This
appropriation of the Greek is a lie. You and I are talking. We're talking about the original
mysteries. We're talking about why Jesus would call himself a Christ. We're talking about why
the followers, the sons of Levi, why it is that they would cry, why is that with those 12 stones?
12, 13, 23. Love it. Let's go. Let's go to the next one. That was creepy. Here. Look, people.
What's around the throne? Damater. What's around the throne? Look at the last word. She's a wadzusa.
She's a wadzusa. What is she doing? She's crying. She's crying. In what?
Sitting on her throne encircled by a whirlwind of that smoke. Does everybody have the image? Please
set that. If you walk away, walk away with this set in your mind. She sits. She sits on that throne
and around her is that whirlwind. That is how we bring Sophia. Sophia. Can we get the next one?
We're almost there. We're almost finished. Look at this, people. Here's the ewazo to cry. Ewa,
just to see, you know, just to see if anybody cares, right? There it is. Digest that later. Jesus,
what are you? What are you, Jesus?
Under duress. Jesus is telling us he's monogenes. He's monogenes? Yeah. And all the Bible scholars,
all the Bible scholars running the door, right? They couldn't be here for the rest of the lecture
because it's corruptive to their ears. They can't hear, you know, to say something
so profoundly disturbing as skeins gland. Does that frighten you all? Does the skeins gland frighten
you all? It should be a draw, but instead it repels you. Okay, so for those of you who are repelled by
the skeins gland, here you are, ladies of frustration. You know what I'm talking about.
I can feel it out there. I know you. I know you. You know what I mean? You can't, you know,
you can't. Just some, we're not, some just can't go to the tent, you know what I mean?
That's where we're going in history, to the skeine, to that tent. Are you ready? Does anybody
notice that we've been there? Hey, did those people pass out over there? The people who were
watching on the big screen, right, with a popcorn? Somebody passed out. Did somebody pass out?
Wake them, wipe off their face and wake them up. Okay, let's go back. Let's go. Yeah, here we go.
