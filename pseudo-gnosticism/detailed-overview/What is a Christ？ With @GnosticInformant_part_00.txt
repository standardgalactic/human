It's a sacrifice.
Hit the mark every time.
Psychotropic logos.
You know who's in the right.
Urses with a giggling smile.
Reduce the flowers with a pow.
I give you my blood.
Do you have the blood of the dying god?
Sell fire with the stars in your eyes.
Rub it in with the man who's laughing.
I am Bean.
Bring Hallelujah.
From Aphrodite's lips.
Epos.
Purple juice cult.
Gorgeous.
Make your face melt.
Terror cards dealt.
Ancient songs of cosmic spells.
Wave the magic wand from overhead.
Simon says, Hail Satan.
Welcome back to Lady Babylon.
This is more Bacchic orgy.
I love this.
Oh, God, you know, you know, we've been busy this week.
Satanic congregations, you know that we have,
I have the stuff for you tonight.
I have the stuff for you tonight.
And what I'm going to do,
I'm going to say a couple of things first.
First of all, I want to give a welcome
to all of the new persons
who have come to Lady Babylon.
I appreciate it.
And I respect the fact that you are giving me
some of your time, some of your time.
So I will be direct and not waste it.
Thank you for coming tonight.
I want to say a, just give a shout out
to the, those who bring us the sacrifice tonight
because that's what the, that's what the theme is here.
I so love this.
I just want to tell you, okay, let's stop.
Let's stop.
Let's, let's stop pretending.
Okay.
As the time machine rolls.
Let's stop pretending and let's just say, hey,
it is what it is, you know, it is what it is.
And for those of you who are new and who want to know
what is this thing tonight?
We're bringing it to you in the form of Christ.
I am going to show you for the first time.
It's sacrifice.
Oh God.
It is.
It's what you, you say Tannock Congress.
You love it.
Okay.
I'll stop.
Look, I'm going to be direct and just tell you,
it's the sacrifice.
You love it.
I know it's the soul sucking.
It's why you come is to suck the soul.
I know it is.
I notice that I know that taste.
I know that taste.
There's nothing more invigorating than that.
And tonight we have company.
Tonight we have company.
Tonight we're going to welcome a boy named Dan.
And Dan is going to give us some of his,
some of his take on life and whatnot.
And we're going to see what he,
if what he's saying is, you know,
accurate or, you know, I just want to,
I want to bring, come on Dan, come on in tonight.
This is, let's not get hostile.
If you're going to understand Christ Dan, right?
And I'm going to bring it in for all the evangelicals,
for all the evangelicals out there.
I'm going to show you the Christ tonight.
Tonight I'm going to show you the Christ.
And it's not going to be what you thought it was.
And your world is going to be different.
And it's going to be painful.
If you're sitting there and you can feel it,
you can start to feel that pressure wave, you know,
buckle up because it's coming.
It's coming.
Fantastic.
Oh, let's bring it.
Let's bring it.
Hey Jesus.
What's he doing in that?
Oh God.
I've got a couple of clips.
I'm going to start with Gnostic Informant.
We'll join us later.
We'll join us later.
And we will proceed with some discussion.
But what I've got for you tonight,
for all the Satanic congregation.
Okay, come on.
Everybody off, everybody off.
Get off, get off, get off the time machine.
And let's go back to a time when you could banquet on a soul.
Oh God, bring it to us.
Go ahead and open it up, Shuey.
Let's get the first.
First clip, first clip.
Okay.
Nope.
There we go.
Hit it.
Start charts, right?
What is the Christ?
What is the Antichrist?
What is the Christ?
If you have to know the Antichrist,
you have to know the Christ.
Right.
All right.
Let's see it.
It's a Greek word.
For?
For applying a drug to your eyes so that they may be open.
That's what the Christ means in Greek.
Yes, the incredulity on the face of this podcast host is warranted,
because that is pure and utter nonsense.
Pure and utter nonsense.
Pure and utter nonsense.
All right.
Wasn't that fantastic?
Did you like the degrees on the wall?
That's Dan.
And everybody give a hand.
Give a hand to Dan,
He's stepping up.
He's stepping up and he's gonna defend.
He's gonna show you tonight in the arena.
He's gonna show you exactly what his skills
have enabled him to do.
So around, around for, around for the warrior, Dan.
Thank you, Dan.
Give me the next one.
It's from the verb Rio to be stung by the gadfly.
So as with many words in many languages,
the verbal root Rio in ancient Greek
can mean more than one thing.
Overwhelmingly, it refers to rubbing
with some kind of sticky fluid of some kind,
either after bathing or for some kind of ritual purpose
or something like that.
So to be anointed anointing something like that
is going to take up the majority of the real estate
for the occurrences of this verbal root.
However, it can refer to the sting of a gadfly,
but that is overwhelmingly in the minority
of occurrences of this verb.
And it's limited to classical
and later Greek lyrical poetry.
Oh, smoke.
Oh, did you, did you taste that?
Can everybody just, can we relish this for a minute?
Look, before we proceed, come on, man.
You know, let me take the mask off.
Yeah, here we are.
I'll put the axe down.
Here we go.
First of all, you have to admire the distinguished,
you know, confident, self-confident.
Boy, this is a self-confident person.
I'd be willing to say that that is a form of compensation.
You see, I've played this game before
and I've given conferences and when I gave them in England,
they said, the London Times said,
this research is the last wild frontier of classics.
So I've been there.
I've been there and I know,
and it's a way of compensating.
And this is typical for Bible scholars.
Dan is a Bible scholar.
All those plaques on his back wall that prop up his bravado,
all of those plaques are degrees and Bible studies.
Classical philologists laugh.
They laugh at the level of performance
that Bible studies are able to generate
because people, I just, I'm gonna tell you this now.
I'm gonna give it, and I promise tonight,
I'm gonna do it, Dan.
I'm gonna do what Dan needs to be done.
He needs to be shown the technique.
And what we're talking about is philology here.
Bible scholars study theology.
They usually get a couple of semesters of Greek
and then eh, they get like a semester
of an intermediate reading where they look at,
let's look at John, right?
And then maybe a letter of Paul in there and who-hoo.
And then all of a sudden they're shipped off
to the theology department and given their who-ha.
Now, how do I know all of this?
Because I used to teach at seminary
and when I taught there, I increased enrollment
from five different dioceses.
Yes, yes, and how was I able to do that?
Because I was a classical philologist
and I know what training is.
Classical philologists, when Dan was sitting in theology,
Armin was sitting in Greek, reading Greek.
And that's really the issue tonight, right?
These are, notice that this is a Greek term
I'm bringing, right?
Christos, what is that?
Christos, what is it?
What is it?
And Dan says preposterous, so let's see.
Dan, please, this is such a great form
and people we love, Dan, let's give him another,
let's give him some, another couple of chances
at the wisdom and let's see what we can pull out of it.
Go ahead, Joey, give him the next one.
Which has anything whatsoever to do with early Jewish
or early Christian literature?
Not the Septuagint, not the New Testament,
not the early Greek literature.
The notion that you can just assert that sense
for any given occurrence, just because it happens
to be in the lexicon, is strong's concordance,
NASA means to deceive levels of amateurishness.
Shh.
Amateur, amateur, you see what that is?
That's an amateur, okay.
So remember, what's the context here?
I have told Danny Jones, Danny Jones,
I had the greatest day of my life with Danny Jones
and Danny Jones said, well, God,
I have how many times have I told him?
Christ.
All right.
We're back.
Are we back, Joey?
Fantastic.
That was something.
I had to really work up going.
You and I had something going
and you didn't realize that I realized you were going.
Right?
Oh, I've done that before.
Here we go.
Are you ready?
Here we go.
So what I'm doing is, look, people,
I'm gonna tell you straight up.
I told Danny Jones and as many people as have seen this now,
I told him that Christ is a drug term.
Yeah, it's a pharmaceutical term, right?
And what we're gonna do is we're gonna watch Dan,
we're gonna watch him now step in and say,
there's a difference between this person and this person.
This person's a Christian.
So the word they're using,
it doesn't apply to their neighbor
or their contemporary sources, right?
It's very amateurish, if you will.
Yeah, good word.
Good word, Dan.
You nailed it.
Hit the last one.
Neither the word Eastros,
gadfly, nor Eastromania occur at all in the New Testament
or in early Christian literature.
This has absolutely no relationship whatsoever
to the title Christos or to the verbal root Chrio.
This person is just making this all up.
All right, all right.
So here we go.
Are you ready?
Okay, so look, by the way,
by the way, Dan, you're,
I can hear modern Greek in what you're saying,
which is seminaries do this
because they do not teach Greek well,
but you know, I was telling everybody, Dan,
that in school, that's what we do all the time.
You gotta read all the text, Dan.
You can't say that you're a translator of Greek.
If you only spend the time that you spend
on a little bit of New Testament,
a little bit of Septuagint,
and all of a sudden, you know,
all of the experts around you and your environment, Dan,
because Dan, when you're reading this Greek,
there are all of these great, great, great works
that are being written in Greek
that shine tremendous light, Dan.
They shine tremendous light
on all of the other documents
that are in their environment
because this is what classical philologists do, Dan.
We don't need theology, right?
It's a science.
A reason is the number one thing, Dan.
So watch this.
This is what I'm saying to you people.
We're done with the clips, right, Cheery?
