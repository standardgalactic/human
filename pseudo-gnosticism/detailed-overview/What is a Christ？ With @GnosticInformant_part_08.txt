And then Machiavelli used it, Brumie used it,
Flavio used it.
It was big in the early Renaissance,
right around the time Constantinople fell,
people were like, this is some dark shit going on
in the last 850, in the last 800 or something a year,
whatever, 500 years.
And we know what they were doing.
They were looking back at the classical antiquities,
classical sources of antiquity.
They're looking back at Ovid and Virgil and Homer
and Aristotle and Hypatia, who's the real martyr,
not the fake martyrs that they've made fake legends about
and Sappho and all these amazing texts that we got,
Euripides, all these amazing plays that we got,
all the mystery religions that people believed in.
That's what Machiavelli was saying.
He's saying, everyone's atheist now.
This is before Nietzsche, forget about Nietzsche.
Machiavelli was saying the same shit Nietzsche was saying.
He was saying, why is it everyone,
nobody even believes in this shit anymore.
It's all just like fake people believe in religion
back in the ancient Roman days.
People look forward to the next Roman festival
of Magna Mater.
People look forward to the games of Apollo.
People look forward to the Dionysian Bacchic revelries
and the Saturnalias.
Every month there was a new festival to look forward to.
Now you got Easter and Christmas.
Yay, no one gives a shit.
And so they're called the Dark Ages.
And I know, what's that scientist name?
Oh, shit.
He got in trouble.
He got in trouble for bringing that term up Dark Ages.
And all the academics were like, bad, bad.
That's a bad term.
You don't use that.
No, you're not allowed to use Dark Ages anymore.
And you've been around academics now.
And you've been interacting with them.
By the way, you also interacted with a great scholar
who works in Haifa, right?
And he worked with Feinkelstein from Tel Aviv.
And the dude who was on the Megida dig.
Oh, God, God, what gorgeousness.
And what was he?
Can you just give the audience a punch line of that?
Because you can't.
Oh, I got a clip, actually.
OK, oh, you have a clip.
Oh, play it, play it.
All right.
This is actually a good, this would actually be a good,
this is, all right, I'm going to stay tuned for my channel
coming out in the next day or two,
probably in the next two days, something like that.
I have the full video of this clip.
And you see it in the archeological records so clearly.
There's nothing before and every, and it starts after.
That I think it's, I mean, it's really hard to argue with that.
This is what I've been saying for,
as long as I started to discover some of this information.
And then, obviously, we get the Septuagint translation
coming a little bit later.
But it doesn't seem like the construction
or the creation of the Genesis, for example,
let's just take Genesis by itself.
Doesn't seem to have been constructed that much earlier,
maybe less than a century before at some point.
In decades.
Yeah, you know, I mean, this was in the 20s.
Do you hear what he said?
He talked about the virtual.
Do you hear what he said?
He said, decades, if not decades.
And by the way, you notice how I wasn't,
I wasn't setting them up.
I wasn't trying to put any words in his mouth.
I was so liberal with how I handled that.
I'll go, hey, when do you think the,
I go, when do you think the translation came about?
How century at least?
He said, maybe decades.
We're talking somewhere between 300 and 270
is when we get the Torah,
according to a leading professor at Haifa University.
Can I, can I just say, I told you so.
You've been saying it.
And yeah, no, he's, he's right on it.
And yeah, good.
You know what?
It's nice.
That's so inspiring to see a scholar out there
who's willing to say exactly how it is,
even though, hey, you know what that means, right?
I mean, that's, Neil, that's, that's an atomic bomb.
If he's got a book, that guy.
So stay tuned for my podcast with him,
two and a half hours long.
All we're talking about is dating.
Yeah, he calls it Yahwism.
Yahoo from the elephantine.
We talk about elephantine, Yahwism,
how they're all polytheistic.
There's no Moses, there's no Abraham,
there's no Noah, there's no Jacob,
there's no David anywhere for a thousand years
before 300 BC.
And then, and then he says,
hackatases have there as the first person
that ever mentioned Moses.
Everything we've both been saying for on this,
on your channel and my channel for the last year
and two years, he says it right.
His, his, his work is so separate than us.
How is it that he's coming to the exact same conclusions
as you and me?
Because we're reading the sources.
Science only works one way.
You don't come to two different conclusions
when you have, when you run the certain tests
and put the same evidence.
It's amazing that people didn't, you know,
don't realize that classical philology,
instead of ancient Greek and Latin,
that's a very scientific discipline.
You don't, you know what he said?
It's so, first thing he says in that clip,
it is so clear.
There's nothing before,
he met, he's talking about 300 BC.
He's talking about the year, when he said before,
he meant the library of Alexandria.
Because we were just talking about that
right before that clip.
He goes, it's so clear.
There's nothing before the library of Alexandria
and then all of a sudden after the library of Alexandria,
you get all these Bible texts everywhere
and all of a sudden synagogue stuff.
And by the way, the oldest synagogue
in the archeological record is like 175 BC.
I was there.
The oldest one?
Yeah, second century.
Greek, it's all Greek that's there.
That's all they've got left is the Greek
because they didn't have any Hebrew, right?
And people are always shocked.
By the way, speaking about Dan,
he tells people that the biblical story
becomes historical during,
at the time of David.
Which means King Solomon,
who had all these wives and concubines,
the richest man in the world,
who had all these lands and territories.
Where's the evidence of that?
What do you mean historical?
What?
That, I ran up.
His only book that he has out,
his only peer reviewed book,
Yahweh's Divine Images.
I read it.
In the first chapter, he's dating the Bible
to like 700 BC.
He is in that book.
Yeah, that's...
Guess who published that book?
SBL.
SBL.
Okay, got it.
Okay, now I understand.
Yeah, I hope they made some cash on there.
On their deception.
Yeah.
Yeah, okay, I was going to say something.
It just kind of fled my mind.
I'm kind of overwhelmed because it's,
you know, with the Megiddo dig,
and your professor from Haifa,
he knows...
He knows Finkelstein, right?
Yeah.
Yeah, anyway, with that dig,
they were saying at Megiddo...
Aren't you on that dig?
Yeah, I was.
And what they were saying from the season
that I was there at least,
what they were saying is that
one of the layers was Solomon's, right?
This is Solomon's way station,
and this is where they take tolls and tell you,
there's no...
That stuff's all made up.
It's all made up.
That's why when they dug down to the K-Lite floor,
I was like, yep.
That's part of our video.
That's another thing Gad was saying.
He goes, we used it for the second and first temple period.
What does that even mean?
It's all based on the Bible.
There's no first and second temple period.
By the way, Herod, what is that?
The third temple then?
Why don't we call it the temple that fell in 70?
That's the third temple.
And it's not even...
Poppy, the great Saxon temple in 63 BCE.
The temple's gone after that.
They had to rebuild it after that.
There's a whole bunch of temple periods,
but we only say first and second.
Why?
Because that's what the Bible says.
Yeah, it's like an infiltration,
because when you say this is us
and we are different,
just like Dan was doing tonight.
This is us, Christianity,
and we are different from everybody else around us.
Then you can treat your scholarship that way,
and your history can come out completely
just a bastardized form of reality.
And it's been in those periods
when people discover the source, right?
When you go back to the source.
And you know what I'm talking about,
and you've been there, right?
If you worship the muse, baby,
it's those sources that are everything.
Those sources are everything.
I'm going to throw it to you then,
and I'm going to say,
hey, give me your last thoughts on the evening.
It's been an interesting week.
We've had a lot of things going on.
Give me your last thoughts,
and we'll throw it to the...
Joey, if you can get any questions
that you want to bring them up.
But go ahead.
Ah, man, I think we need to...
There's one thing I do agree with Danon,
is the notion of serving...
religion serving this class of Protestants
and Catholics and Orthodox Christians
needs to go,
as if we're still in the Dark Ages.
I'll just say it like that,
because once we can bring back the idea
that religion has to do with the reflection of the self,
the inspiration of what we call the muse,
the Dionysian spirit, the frenzy,
the inspiration, the Bacchic mania, baby.
Give people fired up about something.
Artistic expression, as in the ancient Greeks
and the ancient Romans and even the ancient Indians
and all the way in the Hindus.
There's a lot of ancient Africans as well.
Bring back the ancient expression of the self as religion.
Bring back the images again.
Idolatry is not evil.
The image...
Bring an image of every single type of person that exists.
Hermaphroditus.
Everything needs to be on a fucking...
as an altar to be worshiped.
An image that represents the self.
Not just one face of a bearded guy on a cross.
No. We need to kill that.
That's what religion needs to be.
That's what I'll say.
What are you talking about?
Are you talking about cult?
What are you talking about?
Yeah, bring back local cults again.
Mystery religions. Do it.
People will actually have something to believe in again.
Instead of dogma.
Right?
Remember that term that they had at the Oracle of Delphi?
What was that phrase that was on the wall
at the Oracle of Delphi?
No, it's the South Town, right?
Or was that...
No, that was on the polo, the temple polo.
No, that's not...
Yeah, it's the Oracle of Delphi, right?
Yeah, love it.
Bring back the image of the virgin warrior.
Those are the things that made people want to live.
Right?
Yeah, the reality.
The reality. There's a zeal.
What do you say though, Neil?
Hang on.
What do you say?
Because people are saying in the comments and stuff,
and I hope people in the chat, we can talk about this too.
But people are saying there's...
Dean and possession and things are...
