have on his face when he got arrested in a public park with a naked kid? Let's go. Keep going. You
guys are going to love it. I bring you the, I bring you the top, top shelf tonight. Look at this.
So they went away and behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in the dream to Joseph. Wait a minute,
we got angels appearing and he, what did he say? He said, take that Pideon, take that kid,
right? Take that little guy and his mother and get out of here. Go to Egypt and stay there until I
tell you otherwise, right? Because Herod, take it down. Herod wants to kill him. Herod wants to kill
him. Joseph had a dream. He had a vision. He had a vision. Okay. Are we going to jump into the
prophets? Yeah, we're going to jump into the prophets only. We're going to see it from the
historical actuality this time instead of from the fairy tale when the evangelicals tell you
Bible times, as soon as they say those two words run, right? It's an unreality. We're going to look
at the text and exactly what the text, they were not making up a thing. It's all coming from the
text. You're going to be surprised when you see the drugs. Let's go. Love it. We know we love it.
Yeah. And he said, you know, get him and go off. Herod's trying to kill you. Go to the next one.
Next one, she went, yeah, but when Herod died, look, look, look this. Angulos came. He appeared.
Onar in a dream. Onar in a dream. Wow, we were in Egypt. Daddy had a dream. So, okay, I see where
you're going. I hear you and the jury hears you and they hear your prophetic personality, Jesus.
Love it. Love it. But let's go and ask a couple of questions. So,
dad brings you back. Now, ask me the riddle me this, Jesus. Were you educated? Did you do
something with all that gold? Did anybody notice you walking around with all that gold? My goodness.
Gold and next thing you know, you'll be buying maid servants. You'll be buying virgins.
Yes. Perhaps we'll find some of those virgins tonight that you could have bought with your gold.
Yeah, maybe we will. How about this, Jesus? I love your clothes. Your threads, man.
Let's not take them apart, right? Let's see who gets this. Let's let the fates determine. I want
those threads. I want those threads morning star. You've got the grove. Let's go. Next text.
Let's follow Jesus, right? You see? You see what happens? Clown. Blow it up, please, chewy.
And oh, look at this, guys. In Greek, you're going to love the little, look at the genitive absolute
that starts this little thing out. Yeah, with the Sabbath coming on. What happened? What happened?
He began to teach in the synagogue. Wait a minute. These synagogues that started to get
billed a couple hundred years ago, right? They're new. They're full of Greek. What are we going to
do? Jesus is going to go around and teach them. Is that what you're going to do? He's a teacher,
ladies and gentlemen. And many people hearing him, they were kind of struck saying, where did he get
these ideas? And this wisdom that he's got, you know, this wisdom that's been given to him.
And what else does he have? He has duna mace and every Bible on the planet in English will translate
this as miraculous miracles, miracles. But we know that's not what it is. We know because we don't
follow the fairy tale. If you thought Jesus was snapping his fingers and stuff was happening, you
are an idiot. And I mean that from Greek. You are what people called
Peter and John. John or James? I forget. But Peter was there. We're looking just a second.
And they called him idiotes. They were uneducated. He didn't even use that word.
We'll look at it. We'll look at it. But that word idiot is definitely there. If you thought
that was happening, it's because you haven't lived. You haven't lived.
Yeah. Boom. Miraculum. No. So what is the duna mace? What are the duna mace? Plural. What are they?
What are they then? He's got good speak. He's got good. Here is where I'll show you the actuality.
Bring it up. Look at this. Duna mace. Generally, power. Power, force, might. The expression of
that power. The expression of some capacity is duna mace. Yeah. And by the way, one classicist
is worth 50 Bible scholars. Yeah, seriously. I would take a season classicist any day of the week
to the best Bible scholars from every top seminary in the country. Seriously. For this reason,
I'm just about to show you. Watch what the text will bring you. We'll show you. Okay.
Look. Duna mace. What else is it? Well, it's a medicine. You're kidding me. I'm in a medicine?
No. Look, look, people, at the end of the first line. Look, look, look, look. Polufarmakoi
duna mace, right? The polypharmic. And we know because you and I have already been there with
Nero. Remember when Nero showed up? We're looking at the recipe. What is a polufarmakoi?
We already know. We already know. We have ears to hear. You've been here the whole time.
Yes, you know what that polufarmakoi is. Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. Jesus. I'm not
ignoring you. I know you want the center of attention. Just chill out there, Mr. Nazareth.
Okay. Let's go to the next text. He's got to do what I tell him to do. Okay.
And so, gee, I think we're one before that. One before that. Yeah. No, that's it. Up,
but keep it up. I want you to see. Now, look at B. Look at 4B. It's the action of those medicines,
right? Which is a title surprise, surprise of a work of Galen, right? Part of the title. Anyway,
on those powers, on those powers, a magical substance, right? Something that has a magical
potency. That is what Jesus is doing. Yeah. He is inducing the drugs. He is bringing you the power
of the medicine because he is the divine Son of God physician. The great physician. Not just
physician, but great, great physician. Aren't you? He nodded. Thanks, bro. Thanks. Let's get another
text there. I don't like this. I feel like I'm being too nice for so long. I've wanted to do this. I
just have a, here's the opportunity. I love everybody for coming. Even the evangelicals who
want to see me do my thing. Thank you for coming. It's a little bit twisted, but I appreciate it.
I do. This is fantastic. And look, so Jesus goes around teaching. He goes around teaching,
presenting himself as a teacher, and he gets these little kids to follow him. And
something happens. Somebody comes in. They're like, what? Who is this guy? He goes back to his
hometown, right? And what happens? The people there are like, isn't this that tecton? Isn't this
that tecton? The son of Mary, right? Brother of James and, and, isn't this that dude? Yeah. Aren't
