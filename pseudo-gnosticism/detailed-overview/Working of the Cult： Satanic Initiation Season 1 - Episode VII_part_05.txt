types of drugs there are some other echidnai who are using the this thing that puts you into darkness
um like a mist yeah there was a mist over his eyes yes now you know right he's just getting
rid of his demons he's exercising his demons right it's a bachic purification yeah fantastic stuff
um gelene pacifies the dry viparine um thirst bringer that's the dipsass right snake the one
that brings the thirst and i want to ask you did you notice how many serpents were involved here
did you notice how many different venoms and did you notice it's um within balancing the
doubt and the antidote that they're they're revealing their own cult um he says look there are
these these goace these old necromancers right that that are involved in um this drug that is um the
asp the asp which their asp it looks like you know it's take it for what it is identification wise
but it has been identified traditionally as the egyptian cobra as the egyptian cobra so
apparently he says the most undisputed magicians right they are using the egyptian cobra
yeah and gelene is so strong she neutralizes even that
yeah this is amazing if we could trace back the genetics because remember it's a woman
who is producing this stuff right you thought the purple trade was psychedelic and expensive
yeah imagine this and now you know why people are sailing around trying to kidnap her
right and there's a line of them and herontosis herontosis opens up with their kidnappings
and the oracles this is everything this is the foundation this is the foundation of the western
world you know and it's christ and antichrist it is dot and antidote these are drugs drugs of
communion produced by the human body let me just make a couple last points um we talked about venomous
spiders and the scorpion they're using those the very famous greek guy was able to urinate those
no ejaculate yeah my nose right ejaculated yeah the venom of the scorpion and this one of the snakes
actually i think it was snakes plural yeah a combo a polo pharmacone that you can only get
from his ejaculation right and it's so bad that he was killing the women that he was having intercourse
with isn't that something ejaculating so if you're stuck in the fairy tale you know like when they
say biblical history or bible times whenever somebody says bible times you realize that's
fairy tale world right so if you want to understand what they're actually doing with these with these
drugs look at um looking at it from a very basic level right and the the religious drugs allow
you to do that right because they're putting somebody into a death state and bringing them out
of it right for a reason so they can be born again right and you can have the vision rip open the
reality right um gelani rejoices in the moist flowers of summertime and in that place the word
specifically points to vaginas right and so again the cop because we're talking about the poma
