sources that you're looking at that's what they are all following that's why they have ears to hear
and it's why guys like byron can use orphic images right as if they were a native speaker
as if they were a native listener that they could hear these terms when jesus walks around saying
this is only for those with ears to hear right you can be talking to a hundred people and there's
two or three in the crowd who are in and he can address those two and everybody else can be like
huh what did he say what what right and people explain it modern-day pastors explain it by saying
oh this is a way he's using an example he's like this great teacher in parables no no no you don't
understand when you are creating um words sentences ideas thoughts when you're expressing
logore that have a double meaning where you only were only one per a receiver can receive that
you're not giving it to the kitties you're not like this is not sunday morning bible study right
this is seclusion this is seclusion this is excluding not including that's what the ears
to hear does it excludes those who are not initiated who do not have life they can't breathe

want people to um uh to support you in that and to support um uh yeah to support one who has had
his demon cast out we have to be um if we're able to purify and we're able to cast out somebody's
devil right we're able to cast them out of that person then that person deserves to be
to have the chance to shave their head into morning and be with us and walk the way right
um so yeah um gnostic informant will also be honoring um honoring uh uh dr carl ruck
and he would like to talk about um censorship and difficulties within academia um because he
knows as as he told me which i don't think that he would have a problem with me sharing with you
that um he realizes that those forces that were he was he had absorbed and was channeling that
are contrary to uh what the initiation is what the satanic initiation is he knows that those forces
were um were exercised and he knows that those are what bring us to a place where we block out um
we block it we we accept ultimately uh the lie that is around us right when we embrace it so um
