So, tonight we're going to track him through Maya
And in order to do that, we're going to track this naked boy through Maya
Yes, you're going to see him there
You're going to see the cult
And for those of you who have ears to hear
You will see the portrait of the Christ that you have never seen before
This is the heart of the lightning
This is that Bacchic lightning
Can you hear the video please?
It seems
All we have here stays behind
We go with what we had when we came
We will leave no track, no trace
No name upon the walk of fame
Way beyond the sky upon another world's shore
Lost inside a dream within a dream
We try to find the reason why we're living what for
Why, which when, where, who, what for
Why, which when, where, who, what for
All we have here stays behind
We go with what we had when we came
We will leave no track, no trace
No name upon the walk of fame
Please go with me now to know us
And let's start with the Greek text
And I just want to give you just a glimpse
If we can just get just a glimpse
I had a student that I'm working with this week
Asked me if we could start reading
And I said yes and he said can we do
Known us, can we read known us
And I laughed because known us is using
Esoteric terminology, he's using cult terminology
He's using a lot of drugs
There are drug references
I mean you can't throw rock in this book
Without hitting the drug reference somewhere
And good stuff too, the arrows
We've got arrow poisons, we've got women
We've got women who are mean ads
Wearing armor, carrying weapons, shooting bows
Smashing heads, armored women
This is not the antiquity of Cambridge
This is not the falsehood, the fairy tale
This has been fed, this is a place where
Great people like Corinna
I forgot to tell you guys about Corinna
Corinna was one who got into the lyric poetry competition
With a very famous person
This very famous person, Pender
Was beaten squarely by her in the competition
And she came up to him afterwards
And let him know, yeah you've been bested
Right, she was doing a little bit of
You know, stepping out, showing him
Because his mouth was big
And all he could say to her was that
You're ugly, yeah, quite a moment in history
Athenian women, women in antiquity
Women all over did not stay in their homes
In silence, this was not the 50s, Mary Beard
This is gorgeous stuff
Tonight we're going to look at the text now
This is known as, let's read it together, shall we?
Epithel, look at that, we start out
Right away as an implication
It's an implication to the muse
And you say, oh they're doing this in antiquity
