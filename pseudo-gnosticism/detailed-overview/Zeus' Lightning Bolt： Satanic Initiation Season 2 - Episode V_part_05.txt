So Zeus takes him and sows him up, right?
Because she is birthing via
Simile is birthing via the lightning
Via the lightning
And the first time we see in line 5
Amai eutoyo decuses
When Zeus intervenes
And he removes the moisture
From Simile
And exposes her to that lightning
To that fire, that great sunfire
She is consumed
She is consumed and
What this process lacks
Is the Maya
There is no Maya
And Nona says that, right?
This artificial practice
That maintains the power of the Jehovah
I don't care if you say Jehovah
Or if you say Jehovah
I don't care, and then everybody says
Shh, don't say it
It's the same God the Father
And he keeps screwing up
He keeps screwing up
He's the oldest liar
Yes, check the Bible, people
My evangelicals who have shown up today graciously
Ask yourself why it is that God is the first liar
Yeah, we're talking here
About the family
Of the flip side, of the flip pole
We're talking about the morning stars
Okay, keep breathing
We'll go in there, we'll get there
So, line five
That's where we are without the Maya
By the way, ladies who are doulas out there
And I know that you've identified yourselves before
Something that I thought was very interesting
That you may have a better understanding of
Is that Maya, the name of the goddess
It's a name, Maya
And her name means her craft
That's how we say midwife is Maya
Maya
What I thought was interesting was
She is the only Olympian
She's the only God within the pantheon
Who prefers and chooses
To live on earth in a cave
She's the only God
She's the only God that prefers to live
In a mortal environment within the cave
And her son preserves that
His messangering is all under her leadership
Under her college
So when you see the caduceus
With the two serpents and the rod
You know this is part of the college
This is part of the college of the midwives
Something very special
I don't know what it means
Maybe somebody can tell me
I don't know what it means
That she is the one who prefers to live
In the element, if you will
