You were sown by Kronos.
Nice.
You were sown by Kronos.
And that word for sown there is literally to throw the seed at right to implant the seed.
Right.
So Kronos is the seed implanter.
Yeah.
You were conceived and it is an excellent translation.
It is conception literally right because look at the line below will have birth.
So these are different images that you're creating.
Who is the one who conceives.

You're going to start to know the images.
So I need you to have the image of Kronos.
And I need you to have the image of Hera.
Right.
Hera is the queen of Queens.
And Kronos as the power of the degrading power of time.
Yeah.
Love that.
The corrosive.

Beautiful.
Anyway.
You were maintained.
And why Kronos?
