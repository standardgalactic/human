Yeah.
As you have exalted Osiris.
So exalt yourself.
And rise just as Helios rises each day.
Your size is equal to the zenith of Helios.
Your roots come from the depths,
but your powers are in the heart of Horus.
Whoops.
It should be Hermes.
Art of Hermes.
Your fibers are the bones of Nevis.
Show us the sacred bull.
Will you show us the sacred bull?
Yeah.
Who are we worshiping?
We as Saturnians.
We as Satanists.
Who are we worshiping?
And your flowers are the eye of Horus.
Your seed is Pan's seed.
Why is he saying these things?
We're still talking to the plant, right?
We're still talking to the plant.
We're capacitating that plant.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Good.
Give us the power, right?
He wants it.
Knows further down Aries and Athena, right?
We know what they do.
We know what the Arai do, right?
We know what Aries really is
and why she originally is that power
that we crave to be able to bring decay.
Arai.
Are you one of the Arai?
Are you one of these furies?
One of these curses.
They all can translate that curse.
Hera, you should hope that you are
equal to the queen of queens.
Yeah.
A start in Ishtar, right?
S-T-R.
Oestras 4.
It's so that we can enter this miraculous state.
Okay.
Let's keep going.
I am acquiring you with good fortune
and good diamond.
That's a little bit.
Yeah.
After you read enough of this PGO,
you'll begin to see the physics.
He's using the eudaimonic, right?
The eudaimonic and he's throwing in just a hint of necromancy
with the touche, right?
I told you guys, if you want to make this work,
the state's attorney in magic,
you have to resort to randomization, right?
You have to resort to the sortace.
It's a physical principle of the binary cosmos,
the bi-dimensional cosmos that we inhabit now.
Thank you, MIT, for enlightening us all.
After saying this, he rolls the harvested stalk
in a pure linen cloth,
but into the place of its roots,
they threw seven seeds of wheat in equal number of barley.
Oh, that's nice.
He's putting something back.
He's putting something back
instead of just taking away everything.
That's a nice gesture.
He mixes them with honey.
I don't know why.
I don't know.
It's some botanist.
I need to tell us what's going on here.
After pouring in the ground,
which he has dug up, he departs,
and he is going to be doing something with this drug
that he has harvested.
He's going to be using the very powers
that we were calling upon, right?
It's an oral incantation.
It's images that, as he's digging up the plant
with his protective gear on, right?
Because that's all that is that's shown here by Carmen.
It's a protective gear for a botanist
who's into pharmacology.
Wonderful, wonderful stuff.
He's burning incense in the process,
and he's fumigating.
He's not in the beginning.
With the pine resin, the retcine,
he is creating a templum,
a space where the power of that God can exist.
These are idolaters.
They don't just call them idolaters
because they have giant stone temples.
They do have giant stone temples,
but they call them idolaters
because their actions are based on the Adolon.
The Adolon.
When you make an Adolon, say you're in training,
and you're supposed to carry out an assassination,
let's just start with that, an assassination.
What you are doing is you have to first bring your Adolon.
You have to construct your Adolon.
It's an image.
Then you take this image,
you purify the space around it
so that it can be filled with the Daimonis,
with the powers.
Then you take that thing that you've purified,
that thing that you've imbued.
You can do this with people too.
The thing that you've imbued with the spirit,
they call those force possessions.
That's a beautiful area of ancient magic, necromancy.
Imagine force possession.
It's like VR, but active.
It's a real VR.
Control somebody from a distance, like remote control.
Anyway, and they've got death.
You're going to enter into one of these crafts.
You have to be able to know how to charge those substances,
to charge those instruments.
Those are all instruments from which you are able to bring that power
from that dimension that's overlapping ours to this one.
You get a lot of explanations,
ancient explanations of the actual physics
behind all of this binding and how it works.
Who knows, maybe some of the people will find some interest
in that kind of thing.
