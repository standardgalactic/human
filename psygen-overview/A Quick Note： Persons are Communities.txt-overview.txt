The text explores the idea that humans are inherently communal rather than isolated individuals. It argues against the notion of separate individuality, suggesting instead that each person is a community by nature due to deep connections with others and the environment. This interconnectedness includes relationships formed from birth through life experiences and extends to interactions with animals, plants, and even inanimate elements like places.

The author posits that regardless of someone's level of isolation or reliance on representations (such as media), they still form a community. The quality of these communities varies, depending on the authenticity and depth of connections made. Even if one is alone, their interactions with surroundings and self-perception through representations constitute a communal existence.

The text criticizes modern civilization for often substituting genuine relationships with superficial ones mediated by products and frameworks, which can obscure the true communal nature of human beings. This separation from authentic community ties is likened to a form of torture because it goes against our inherent need for connection. The author expresses hope that society will eventually recognize and embrace this interconnected reality.
