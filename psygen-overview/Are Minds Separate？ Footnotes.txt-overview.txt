The text you provided is a reflective piece exploring themes of consciousness, the nature of miracles, and human experience. Here’s a breakdown of its main points:

1. **Consciousness and Miracles**: The author suggests that our minds possess capabilities beyond what we typically understand or acknowledge in our waking lives. These include experiences like dreaming, which offer a different mode of consciousness that seems almost miraculous.

2. **Dreaming Experience**: Dreams are highlighted as deeply intimate and participatory experiences. They present scenarios where conventional forms of communication (like speaking) are altered or absent, suggesting other faculties of the mind at work.

3. **The Limitations of Waking Life**: The author notes how ordinary consciousness is often limited to mundane concerns—daily chores, routines—and lacks the richness found in dreams or deep human connections.

4. **Human Connection and Transformation**: Engaging deeply with others through conversation, art, music, and shared experiences can transform our awareness and draw us out of everyday monotony into something more profound and meaningful.

5. **Seeking More**: The text concludes by emphasizing that humans naturally seek richer, more fulfilling experiences—whether through love, adventure, creativity, or mutual support—as an invitation to the "miraculous" within us.

Overall, the piece invites readers to consider how our everyday awareness can be expanded and enriched by embracing these deeper, often overlooked aspects of human experience.
