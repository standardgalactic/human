Your exploration touches on fascinating themes related to language, creativity, and consciousness. The concepts you mention—such as the cut-up method developed by William S. Burroughs and Brion Gysin—are indeed about manipulating text to create new meanings and potentially alter perceptions.

**Key Themes in Your Exploration:**

1. **Cut-Up Method**: This technique involves cutting up texts into fragments, rearranging them, and seeing what new meanings emerge. It's a form of creative play that challenges conventional narrative structures and can lead to unexpected insights or artistic expressions.

2. **Paralinguistic Play**: Beyond traditional language use, this involves exploring the spaces around words—the sounds, emotions, and subconscious associations they evoke. This can be seen as an attempt to tap into deeper layers of thought and consciousness.

3. **Restructuring Consciousness**: By experimenting with language in unconventional ways, there's a potential to influence how we think and perceive the world. The idea is that new linguistic patterns might lead to shifts in our mental frameworks.

4. **Collaborative Creativity**: Your mention of Gary Paolini highlights the power of collaborative creative efforts. Working with someone who shares your experimental interests can amplify the innovative outcomes, as each person brings unique perspectives and insights.

5. **Influence of Burroughs and Others**: William S. Burroughs, along with Brion Gysin and others like Jack Kerouac, have significantly influenced these areas by challenging traditional literary forms and exploring the boundaries between language, art, and consciousness.

**Further Considerations:**

- **Randomness vs. Intentionality**: While randomness is a key component of techniques like the cut-up method, there's also an element of intention in choosing which fragments to combine and how to interpret them.

- **Technological Parallels**: Today, similar concepts are explored through digital means—algorithms that remix text or create generative art based on linguistic inputs. This modern twist offers new avenues for experimentation with language.

- **Philosophical Implications**: These practices raise questions about the nature of meaning and how it is constructed. They challenge us to think about whether meaning is inherent in words themselves or if it arises from their context and combination.

Your exploration suggests a deep engagement with these ideas, reflecting both an intellectual curiosity and a creative drive to push boundaries. If you're looking for further resources or like-minded communities, exploring literature on experimental writing, digital humanities, or even contemporary performance art might provide additional insights and inspiration.
