The passage you provided reflects on the deeper meanings and origins of holiday traditions like Christmas, juxtaposing modern criticisms with ancient spiritual beliefs and experiences. Here are some key points:

1. **Cultural and Spiritual Origins**: The author suggests that holidays like Christmas have roots in spiritual or non-ordinary realities, involving beings who traverse a metaphorical network to bring gifts. These elements—such as Santa Claus, reindeer, bells, and lights—are seen not just as cultural symbols but as remnants of ancient experiences.

2. **Critiques vs. Ancient Wisdom**: The text argues that modern criticisms often miss the profound spiritual significance behind these traditions because they lack awareness or understanding of their origins.

3. **Non-Ordinary Experiences**: The author mentions having personal, direct encounters with non-ordinary aspects of existence and spirituality—experiences that shape one's view of reality beyond conventional beliefs.

4. **Angelic Beings and Spiritual Hierarchies**: The passage references spiritual beings that are often depicted in religious or mythological contexts, such as angels or gods, suggesting they might be more akin to powerful spirits or intermediaries rather than deities as traditionally conceived.

5. **Symbolism and Sacredness**: Even if some view these traditions as nonsensical, the author argues there's an inherent sacredness tied to them, rooted in deep human experiences of meaning and reverence—whether through logical principles or spiritual insights.

6. **Personal Reflection and Experience**: The author shares personal reflections about experiencing elements like Cupid or angels, which are often misunderstood when depicted artistically or mythologically.

Overall, the passage invites readers to consider holiday traditions not merely as cultural constructs but as links to profound human experiences and ancient wisdom that transcend time.
