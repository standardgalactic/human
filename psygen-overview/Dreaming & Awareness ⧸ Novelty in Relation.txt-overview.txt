Here are some key points from the text:

1. **Dreams as Magical Experiences**: Dreams are seen as magical due to their ability to bring in extraordinary aspects of identity, meaning, and emotional impact.

2. **Awareness and Identity Through Life Phases**: The author reflects on how human beings experience different ages internally and externally throughout life. There's an emphasis on the idea that our core being might not age at the same rate as our physical bodies.

3. **Natural State of Being Affected by Sensory Experience**: Dreaming is described as a natural state where sensory experiences deeply affect us, suggesting it might be more aligned with our inherent nature compared to waking life.

4. **Visioneering and Envisioning the Future**: The author distinguishes between dreaming and visioneering—the act of envisioning a future we wish to achieve and working towards it. This is portrayed as an essential part of human existence, necessary for personal growth and fulfillment.

5. **Critique of Commercialized Methods**: There’s a critique of commercial methods that claim to aid in achieving goals or manifesting desires, like "The Secret." The author finds these commodified approaches misleading and not trustworthy.

6. **Importance of Envisioning the Future**: Visioneering is emphasized as crucial for health and well-being, though challenging under certain circumstances, which can impede one's ability to envision and work towards a desired future.

The discussion revolves around the exploration of dreams as a unique form of consciousness distinct from waking life. It highlights how dreaming allows individuals to experience seeing in a different way that integrates emotion and context, offering transformative insights into personal awareness. The narrative underscores the potential of dreams to alter self-identity and emotional tone, emphasizing their role as a training ground for understanding death or spiritual evolution.

The text also reflects on the comparison between natural non-ordinary experiences and those induced by psychedelic drugs. While psychedelics can provoke intense "feeling seeing" states, they often emulate these experiences rather than naturally eliciting them, raising questions about authenticity in altered states of consciousness. The author values spontaneous profound experiences over drug-induced ones due to their deeper impact and potential risks.

Finally, the discussion advocates for expanding waking life awareness by incorporating non-ordinary faculties that dreams naturally facilitate. It encourages embracing diverse non-traditional experiences as vital for personal growth and spiritual development, despite societal constraints or perceptions of danger associated with such states. The overarching message is one of openness to the enriching potential of dreaming and other extraordinary consciousness forms.
