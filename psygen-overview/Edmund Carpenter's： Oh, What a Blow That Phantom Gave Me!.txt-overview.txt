The text discusses how people historically needed to translate images from advertisements into real-world experiences, such as seeing famous landmarks in person and taking similar photographs. This need was driven by older generations' desire to validate their perceptions of images encountered through media. The text contrasts this with younger generations who are less concerned with matching reality to these pre-existing images, a shift attributed to conditions unique to literacy.

Furthermore, it highlights how advertisements have evolved to provide more satisfaction than the actual products they represent, sometimes even advertising non-existent products as a way to gauge public interestâ€”a tactic similar to government press leaks. The text illustrates this idea with an anecdote about a neighbor's reaction to a baby compared to its photograph, emphasizing the self-sufficiency of images in contemporary culture.
