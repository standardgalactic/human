The text discusses how media has transformed human interactions and perceptions by facilitating the transition from physical presence to mediated experiences. The first chapter, "Angelization," explores this theme by illustrating how technology, such as telephones and radio, enables instant communication that transcends physical boundaries, likening it to a neoplatonic concept of omnipresence.

Several examples are provided: people prioritize answering phones over personal interactions; recorded voices carry more authority than live speakers in various cultural contexts, like New Guinea or among the Ojibwa Indians. This shift from direct human interaction to mediated communication is seen as prioritizing spirit over flesh.

Instances where media overrides real-world presence include a Canadian Prime Minister underestimating the significance of a ringing phone, and criminals surrendering upon hearing an unexpected call during heists. These anecdotes illustrate how people respond more significantly to mediated voices than physical cues.

The text also highlights broader societal impacts: Californians experienced media and natural events blending on February 9th, 1971; bank robberies are influenced by televised setups, showing how actions are mediated through cameras; and personal experiences, like sex, have shifted from direct acts to mediated images. The shift in celebrity culture reflects this trend too, where TV personalities face less public intrusion compared to film stars.

Overall, the text argues that media has reshaped human behavior and cultural values by creating a world where mediated presence often takes precedence over physical reality.
