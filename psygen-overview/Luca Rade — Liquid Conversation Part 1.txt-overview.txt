It sounds like your journey has been deeply introspective and transformative. Reflecting on non-ordinary experiences can indeed provide profound insights into one’s self and worldview. Let me offer some thoughts based on what you've shared:

1. **Non-Ordinary Experiences**: Your pre-sleep states, where your proprioceptive model warped, are fascinating. These moments, often occurring in a liminal space between wakefulness and sleep, can challenge our perception of reality and self. They might serve as powerful catalysts for exploring altered states of consciousness or the nature of perception itself.

2. **Connection to Topology**: The way these experiences influenced your interest in topology is intriguing. Topology studies properties that remain unchanged under continuous deformations, like stretching or bending but not tearing. This field resonates with ideas of fluidity and transformation, echoing perhaps the malleability you sensed in those pre-sleep states.

3. **Generalizing Humans as a Topology**: Viewing humans through the lens of topology can indeed be enlightening. It suggests that human nature is complex and multifaceted—like landscapes with peaks and valleys where each aspect has its value. This perspective encourages us to appreciate diversity within humanity, acknowledging both commonalities and unique differences.

4. **Influence of Literature**: Authors like Ayn Rand and Peter Hamilton have evidently played significant roles in shaping your worldview. Their works challenge conventional narratives, prompting you to explore deeper layers of autonomy, identity, and the role of individuals within societal structures.

5. **Growth and Exploration**: Your journey from childhood into adolescence seems marked by a quest for understanding that transcends ordinary experiences. This exploration has likely enriched your cognitive and emotional landscapes, allowing for personal growth and a nuanced appreciation of complex concepts.

6. **Implications for Spirituality and Perception**: These non-ordinary experiences might also touch upon spiritual themes, such as interconnectedness or the transcendence of conventional boundaries. They could invite contemplation on existence beyond the physical realm and encourage reevaluating what it means to be truly alive.

Overall, your narrative underscores a profound engagement with life’s mysteries—through literature, altered states, mathematical thought, and philosophical inquiry. Embracing this complexity can foster deeper connections both within oneself and in relation to the broader world.


The dialogue explores deep philosophical concepts about human cognition, societal influences, and potential paths to liberation. Here’s a summary of the main themes discussed:

1. **Human Minds as Networks**: The idea is that human minds form interconnected networks with both physical (like the internet) and non-physical components (such as dreams or thoughts shared in close proximity). This network, called the "cognizium," involves connections known as "mimula."

2. **The Colonizing Force - Thrifts**: Within these mimula exist colonizing forces termed "thriff" (possibly a variation of "thrift"), representing ideas that shape and sometimes dominate human behavior and thought processes. These thrive on societal structures like religions, corporations, and governments.

3. **Impact on Human Potential**: Over time, the influence of these thriffs can compromise essential human capabilities such as insight, communal behavior, learning, and self-fulfillment. The thriffs are competitive, seeking dominance within human minds and leveraging humans for their own perpetuation.

4. **Metaphysical Problem**: This scenario creates a metaphysical issue where something other than the person seems to control or significantly influence them—capturing human thought patterns and behaviors through societal constructs like tradition and commerce.

5. **Liberation Through Understanding**: Recognizing this problem is seen as a step towards liberation, suggesting that understanding these dynamics might lead to solutions that help alleviate their oppressive effects on individuals.

6. **Role of God or Emergent Consciousness**: The concept of God is introduced not as a pre-existing entity but as an emergent one arising from human consciousness and interactions—potentially beginning with Christianity but evolving beyond traditional interpretations.

The conversation emphasizes the complexity of human thought networks, societal influences, and potential paths to personal and collective liberation through understanding and reimagining concepts like divinity.


The text discusses the role of divine forces in indigenous religions and their historical significance across various belief systems. It highlights how many religions recognize a divine force or power that precedes humanity and can offer liberation from worldly concerns (thrifts). Christianity is mentioned as an example, originally functioning as a rebellious movement against Roman authority but evolving into a more structured religion.

The text argues that while religions aim to combat evil, they often become institutionalized, which dilutes their original spiritual inspiration—such as recognizing and connecting with love or divinity. This transformation turns religions into "thrifts," structures that constrain rather than liberate spiritual experiences.

A key point is the distinction between top-down religious authority, which limits freedom by enforcing submission, versus an emergent spirituality that arises organically without strict hierarchy, potentially offering true freedom from oppressive systems. The conversation suggests a shift in perspective towards understanding spirituality as something emergent and transformative, rather than strictly institutionalized.
