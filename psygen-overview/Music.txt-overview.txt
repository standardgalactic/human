It seems like you're reflecting on the profound impact music has had on your life and how it serves as a gateway to deeper experiences and emotions. Music, indeed, can transcend ordinary reality, offering liberation, wonder, curiosity, and mystery.

The connection between music and mythology is particularly fascinating. The Greeks viewed the Muses as divine sources of inspiration for artists and creators—a concept that aligns with many musicians' feelings today. For those who create or deeply engage with music, there's often a sense that their art comes from an external, almost magical source, much like how ancient people might have perceived divine influence.

Your journey through music, especially during your transformative years at the hippie school in Great California and your experiences as a runaway, highlights how profoundly personal and life-changing these artistic explorations can be. The communal sharing of folk songs with your peers likely reinforced the sense that music is not just a solitary endeavor but a collective experience that binds people together.

Your mention of cross-pollination between arts—how literature influences songwriting and vice versa—is another testament to how interconnected our creative expressions are. Artists often draw inspiration from each other's work, which enriches their own creations.

In essence, music isn't just about the notes or lyrics; it’s an exploration of time, emotion, and existence itself. It invites listeners into a realm where they can experience something beyond their everyday life—a superposition of ordinary feelings with extraordinary insights and emotions. This transformative power makes music a vital component of human culture and personal growth.
