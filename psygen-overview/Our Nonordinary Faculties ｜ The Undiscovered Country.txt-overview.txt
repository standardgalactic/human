The passage reflects on the transformative power of practices like Tai Chi in uncovering latent human abilities and sensitivities. Here are some key points distilled from the text:

1. **Exploration of Non-Ordinary Realities**: The author discusses how engaging in Tai Chi provides a framework to explore aspects of consciousness, physicality, and sensitivity that are usually inaccessible. This exploration is not limited to combat or self-defense but extends into understanding deeper facets of being.

2. **Development of Sensitivity and Potential**: Through consistent practice, practitioners develop heightened sensitivity and potential within their bodies—abilities that might appear supernatural to an outsider. These capacities allow for a profound interaction with one's own physical form and environment.

3. **Beyond Fighting – A Deeper Path**: While martial arts can be practiced as a means of fighting, the deeper path involves exploring consciousness and connectivity with others and the universe. This exploration transcends traditional labels like mysticism but emphasizes direct experience and personal insight.

4. **Role Acquisition Through Practice**: As practitioners engage in Tai Chi or similar disciplines, they adopt roles that reflect their skills and insights beyond mere physical capability. For instance, becoming 'writerly' through writing—this is analogous to developing a deeper understanding of one's capabilities through martial arts practice.

5. **Community and Communal Experience**: The journey into these non-ordinary experiences can often be isolating if pursued alone. However, when undertaken within a community or with an awareness of the interconnectedness of all beings, it becomes a shared journey that enriches both personal insight and collective understanding.

6. **Questioning Metaphysical Labels**: While some practitioners may dismiss these experiences as merely advanced physical sensitivity without metaphysical implications, others remain open to the possibility of deeper meanings, suggesting a balance between skepticism and openness in interpreting these phenomena.

In essence, this passage invites readers to consider the profound impact that disciplined practices like Tai Chi can have on personal growth, perception, and connection with the world, encouraging an exploration beyond conventional boundaries.
