It sounds like you're sharing a personal narrative involving experiences with an individual named Molly Denman (possibly referring to Michael "Molly" Dolan or similar), shamanic practices, and cultural observations about traditional healing methods.

The story touches on several themes:

1. **Personal Experiences with Molly Denman**: The narrator describes being involved in what seem like mystical or spiritual experiences with Molly Denman, including some skepticism about their authenticity (e.g., the mention of "little dwarf people" in a cave).

2. **Shamanic Practices and Initiation**: There is a discussion about shamanic initiation experiences involving natural elements (earth, water, fire, etc.). The narrator suggests these are valuable traditions that can be sought through local shamans familiar with these practices.

3. **Cultural Observations on Healing**: You mention differences in the effectiveness of traditional African herbs for treating malaria between locals and someone who is not from the region, suggesting a cultural or perhaps genetic component to how treatments work.

4. **Skepticism and Belief**: The narrative reflects skepticism about certain claims (e.g., seeing spirits or entities) while also expressing belief in some practices and experiences.

If you're interested in exploring any of these themes further—whether it's shamanic traditions, cultural healing practices, or personal narratives around mystical experiences—please let me know how I can assist.


The passage you provided seems to be an excerpt from a conversation or narrative focusing on spiritual experiences and the impact of religious upbringing, particularly within the Jehovah’s Witnesses faith community. Here’s a breakdown:

1. **Personal Experience**: The narrator recounts undergoing various forms of baptism—spiritual, traditional Christian, and what they refer to as "water" baptism in Africa. These experiences seem transformative, especially regarding their departure from being a Jehovah's Witness.

2. **Religious Context**: The narrative discusses how religious teachings and familial pressures influenced the narrator’s psyche growing up. The constant internal conflict between familial expectations, religious doctrines, and personal freedom is highlighted.

3. **Baptism and Transformation**: The water baptism in Africa serves as a significant turning point, allowing the narrator to mentally release themselves from the constraints imposed by their former religion and family.

4. **Religious Critique**: There’s a critique of how religions can exploit vulnerabilities within individuals, using threats like eternal damnation or social exclusion to exert control.

5. **Eschatological Themes**: The discussion touches on eschatology—the part of theology concerned with death, judgment, and the final destiny of the soul and humankind—which seems particularly emphasized in Jehovah’s Witness teachings.

6. **Cultural Appropriation**: There's a brief mention of cultural appropriation concerning religious practices, suggesting that modern religions may borrow from ancient traditions.

7. **Further Exploration**: The passage ends with an indication to continue exploring these themes further after a break.
