The text from "Adonis, Sufism and Surrealism" highlights three key characteristics of Sufi-influenced Arab poetical writing, which catalyzed a shift in poetic expression:

1. **Transcendence of Form**: Poetry is seen not just as ornamental language but as an experience that transcends words, embodying emotion, action, consciousness, and thought. It integrates matter with meaning, drawing together emotions and ideas.

2. **Beyond External Reality**: Poets should look beyond mere external material reality to explore the broader scope of existence. Traditional naturalism is critiqued for its limited focus on surface appearances rather than deeper internal dynamics, suggesting poets should delve into more profound aspects of nature and life.

3. **Truth as Mystery**: Truth is not confined to scientific or conventional forms but lies hidden within things' concealed worlds. Sufi writing emphasizes reaching this truth through unique, non-conventional knowledge that transcends visible phenomena to explore the invisible and subjective realms.

The text advocates for a radical shift in acquiring knowledge, freeing it from socio-political and religious constraints, thereby enriching internal subjective experiences with emotions, desires, and dreams. This liberation leads to two distinct languages: a logical language representing external reality and an effective, figurative language that awakens and enriches inner realities.

Sufi writing is portrayed as an experience of attaining the absolute through myth and symbol, offering deeper meaning and connecting individuals to collective unconsciousness and human memory. These elements serve as bridges between apparent and concealed truths, illuminating various levels of reality, allowing poets not only to discover the unknown but also to creatively reinterpret known concepts, thus transforming poetry into a form of knowledge.
