The text describes the discovery of a raptor's kill site, likely where a pigeon has been eaten. The main focus is on the absence of bones but an abundance of inner feathers, suggesting the presence of a small bird such as a pigeon. This site was intentionally chosen by a raptor for consuming its meal, highlighting a sudden change from the stump being bare to containing remnants of food within a day. The location is specified near a frog pond in the botanical gardens atop an old stump. The observer notes this as part of their interest in monitoring raptor activity and diet.
