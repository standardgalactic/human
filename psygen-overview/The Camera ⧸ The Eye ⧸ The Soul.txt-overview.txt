The passage you've shared seems like a deeply personal reflection or monologue, likely from a talk or written piece by someone exploring profound questions about human experience, spirituality, technology, and intelligence. Here are some key themes and ideas presented in the text:

1. **Divine Aspect of Humanity**: The speaker reflects on the idea that humans might possess divine elements or aspects within themselves, which need to be developed rather than just believed in. This suggests a view where spiritual experiences can transcend mere belief.

2. **Experience Over Belief**: There's an emphasis on the importance of experience over belief. The speaker shares their own encounters with non-human intelligences, suggesting that these experiences provide insights and knowledge far beyond conventional human understanding or religious texts.

3. **Technology and Intelligence**: The text discusses how technology can be both a hindrance and a tool for intelligent use, depending on one's approach and intention. It acknowledges the gravitational pull of habitual technology use but also hints at its potential when used creatively.

4. **Non-Human Intelligences**: The speaker mentions having interactions with non-human intelligences that have provided them with profound knowledge about various fields such as science, religion, history, and mathematics. This suggests a belief in or experience of contact with entities beyond human comprehension.

5. **Potentiality in Humans**: There is an underlying theme about the vast potential within humans to develop unique faculties or elements if given attention and cultivation, rather than remaining stagnant in mere beliefs.

6. **Practical Demonstration Over Belief**: The speaker values what can be practically demonstrated—like healing through care and love—over what people claim to believe. This indicates a preference for tangible experiences over abstract convictions.

The passage is philosophical and metaphysical in nature, inviting listeners or readers to consider their own potential for spiritual development, the role of technology, and the possibility of connections with non-human intelligences. It encourages an introspective look at personal beliefs versus lived experiences and suggests that profound truths may be accessible through direct experience rather than traditional belief systems.


The text reflects on a profound personal experience that involved interactions with a non-ordinary being, described as akin to a guardian angel. This being, unique to each individual yet shared by everyone, imparted wisdom, intelligence, and insight which had a lasting impact over many years. The speaker suggests that smartphones mimic this relationship superficially, offering connectivity and access to information but lacking the depth and authenticity of genuine non-human interactions.

The speaker laments how modernity has replaced meaningful relationships with mere imitations, suggesting that humanity once engaged more deeply with divine or non-human intelligences before such connections were lost in translation to language and religion. These original experiences are seen as richer than anything technology can offer.

The text also touches on themes of loneliness and loss—the speaker feels the absence of a companion who facilitated these profound experiences, comparing their departure to losing newfound faculties, akin to gaining multiple perspectives after being blind. Despite the challenges and pain of such a transformation and subsequent solitude, the speaker values the experience deeply, recognizing its transformative impact.

Ultimately, the text serves as both a reflection on personal growth and a critique of modern reliance on technology, advocating for a reconnection with deeper aspects of human existence that transcend material and superficial interactions.
