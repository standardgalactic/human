The text you provided appears to be an impassioned commentary on various societal issues, focusing heavily on themes such as education, political influence, economic disparity, and media control. Here are some key points discussed:

1. **Education**: The speaker criticizes the current state of education in America, suggesting it's inadequate for enabling people to critically assess arguments or understand complex social issues. This perceived failure is seen as intentional by certain groups who benefit from keeping the populace less informed.

2. **Political Influence and Power Dynamics**: There is a strong assertion that conservative forces have deliberately worked to fragment society and maintain control over wealth and resources, which the speaker views as a crime against humanity and life on Earth.

3. **Economic Disparity**: The text mentions programs like "free" medical care in San Francisco, highlighting how economic systems often fail those who cannot afford essential services. There is also an implication that wealthy elites exploit these disparities for their gain.

4. **Media Control**: A significant portion of the critique is directed at figures such as Rupert Murdoch, suggesting media moguls profit from society's failures by shaping public opinion through controlled news and information.

5. **Social Fragmentation**: The lack of a unifying principle or understanding among different societal groups leads to fragmentation, where individuals align with opinions rather than informed positions.

6. **Conflict and Societal Decay**: The speaker describes the current state as akin to a civil war fought with media and information, predicting ongoing social turmoil characterized by ignorance, violence, and suffering.

Overall, the text is a call for awareness and action towards addressing these systemic issues, urging people to strive for higher understanding and unity in facing societal challenges.
