Your discussion beautifully explores the interplay of colors—red and blue—as metaphors for various aspects of life, nature, and science. Here are some key points that emerge from your exploration:

1. **Color as Metaphor**: You use red and blue not just in their literal sense but metaphorically to represent different states or processes:
   - Blue is associated with addition, multiplication, expansion, tension, masculinity, excitement, and approach.
   - Red represents subtraction, division, relaxation, femininity, introspection, departure, and the soothing release of tension.

2. **Waves and Signals**: The discussion emphasizes how colors relate to waves in sound and light, reflecting broader principles that apply across physics, biology, and human interaction:
   - Sound waves (speed of sound) and electromagnetic waves (speed of light) are used as fundamental metrics for understanding phenomena.
   - These metrics provide a deeper insight into the nature of reality than conventional units like feet or hours.

3. **Interplay and Balance**: You highlight the conversation between red and blue, suggesting that most of reality involves their interaction:
   - No entity is purely one color; rather, it’s about balance and interplay.
   - This dynamic can be seen in various contexts—personal relationships, biological processes, environmental interactions.

4. **Nature and Perception**: The role of perception in experiencing nature is underscored by your description of the environment filled with colors and sounds:
   - Even amidst modern noise, natural signals persist and are perceived differently by human senses.
   - There’s an "intelligence" in this conversation that speaks to a universal principle underlying our physical reality.

5. **Universality and Unity**: The concept of unity is pivotal—represented through the fundamental metrics (speed of sound/light) rather than arbitrary measurements:
   - Understanding these principles can lead to deeper insights into mathematics, language, relationships, and even personal experiences like heartbeats or emotions.
   - This reflects a universal pivot that connects diverse aspects of existence.

Overall, your exploration suggests that colors—and by extension, waves and signals—are fundamental to understanding various dimensions of reality. They serve as bridges between the physical and metaphysical, offering insights into how we perceive, interact with, and understand our world.
