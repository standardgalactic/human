I'm standing on my back porch in an urban environment and everywhere around me are angles in front
of me there is a stair that leads up to another level of physical structure in front of me
off the small porch that I have mostly what I see well the first thing I see is a house
made maybe in the 1940s next to that there used to be a vista across which I could see
small tree lined mountain covered with structures but also covered with trees however couple
of years ago the person that owned that house decided they wanted more house so they tore
the house down and they actually built a building that looks like someone's first attempt at
a structure in Minecraft they built the equivalent of an 8-bit house and it blocked out the entire
vista of the view from my small balcony between me in that there's a garden that is associated with
the older house and it's occupant and right now in the midst of all those angles there's something
alive and moving something whose nature is absolutely true and real dependable beyond all ideas whose
face is the source of our own minds and whose essential vital relationships are the source from
which we draw our models and technologies sciences and ideas as if we'd invented them of all
cloth but when we get it wrong that disappears under an overlay of simulation language tradition
opinion culture the misunderstanding and misuse of science the opposite of the spirit of religion
masquerading is religion the opposite of the spirit of communion masquerading is government and
nationalism and the opposite of the spirit of humanity masquerading is racism genderism
classism there's a there's an overlay between the content and the culture or rather let us say
that there's an overlay between the content and the context and that overlay is what we
call culture and most of it either deprives us of the content and the context or counterfeits them
and sells us back broken models and toys and entertainments and threats from them and somehow
helpless in between we get neither the context nor the content we don't get the communion we
don't get anything like intelligence what we get is a sort of the remnant of a tragic accident
and then our lives and cultures almost embody all the different kinds of remnants you can get
from shattering those things array them against each other and the living world and our minds
and set the whole thing at play as if Shakespeare's mother wrote it so I want to explore some really
interesting features of this problem and the simple idea is that most of what our cultures
and relationships with language and knowledge do is very deceptive it's like Lucy pulling the ball
away from Charlie Brown every time she goes him to experience the self-developing fulfillment
of an excellent kick and at the last moment pulls it away and gives him some sophisticated
explanation of why she's really teaching him the nature of the world that humans live in
where every pivot can be manipulated for any purpose and there's no real anchor of
verity nobility humanity intelligence trust
so I want to talk about how culture creates a kind of poison pill in which we and the content
on the inside and we and the context on the outside get counterfeited on purpose
and in order to understand this I want you to realize that the stories of history and code both
the views we need to see the solutions and amazing perspectives on the division between
something like what it means to be human and all the other options on the compass
and by the way that compass isn't even a disk it's a sphere so anybody who tells you that one
direction on that sphere is the right way the good way the true way of being human
has flattened the sphere to a disk to a line to a point to a pointer right and they're saying of all
of the domains of all the degrees of liberty in this sphere only the tip of this point is good or
true or human and all those other things are something else now it's interesting because
in one in in some domains that's relatively true you can build a compass that's so bad so ugly so
terrifying on the inside of that sphere that only one or two areas of it are much like being human
and that's kind of what culture ends up doing so culture re-orients this inner spherical
compass toy toward fictions for the sake of those fictions and that process destroys
the real compass we might have and become together again a spherical compass that learns to see
direction rather than declares it like a machine we might re-establish this spherical compass
that includes the content and our relationship with it the context and our relationship with it
and gives precedence to those relationships and the possibility of our intelligence a communion
rather than the possibilities of simulation war fragmentation ecological disaster
fake cultures medicine that does more harm than good
mountains of money made of the blood of current and future generations and living places and so on
so how do all this get started well it probably started a long time before and you figure i
can frame to you but we can orient ourselves around the time just to pick a something everyone's
familiar with probably of the european ships arriving in south america for the first time
and i've heard stories that probably urban myths i don't really believe them at all
that the the natives of the south american continents upon seeing the galleons of the europeans
didn't know what they were right or or maybe even couldn't see them because they were they were so
outside their their ideological experience that they just didn't understand what that was
and there's something kind of true about this if you you know there's a there's a story by
anthropologist that a a villager or an indigenous person who had lived in a very small valley was
taken up for the first time near the top of the mountain and when he looked down
from that mountain and saw large animals and and he asked the anthropologist essentially what are
those insects having never seen from that perspective like a child he had never organized the mind
that can identify and distinguish things from that perspective so there's something
like this that's true about all of us and surely gigantic ships the size of maybe mountains from
some perspectives on the ocean were nothing like anything anything they'd ever seen and the funny
thing is those weren't boats see we might imagine that they too had boats of course they did
but those were not boats in fact what they were was very very strange
they were like a military installation built on a floating war city so those things were very very
strange objects there had never been any kind of boat like that and I think we can see from a
reasonable perspective that what those were were the floating likeness of the overlay literally the
culture that had become the overlays and restructured itself in the likeness of ideas in language
coins in banks guns in hands men at arms a kind of a generalized predator right war predator
so what was coming was some kind of a terrifying monster really very different
from the cultures that the Europeans must have encountered and isn't it interesting they told
we are we are told that in many cases and this seems to happen over and over again in history
a really ironic thing happens um apparently between the colonizers and the people to be
subjugated there is a discussion in which the colonizers explain that they have a book from heaven
it was really shocking and to hear the stories told and again i'm just telling them from my
own perspective this seems to be a point of synonymy or like feeling of mutuality between
the indigenous peoples and the colonizers is that the indigenous people seem to know like oh yeah
there are uh there are skybooks yeah and we know that maybe one day a book will even be made into
an object like a skybook and we've been working on that too right so there was this kind of point
of uh possible point of coincidence which was which was the indigenous peoples knew about the idea
of a skybook or actually rather i've got it backwards the colonizers had the idea of a skybook
the cultures they were encountering were living embodiments of it of one
just like the people in the colonizers were right they were both living embodiments
of something like a skybook plus culture
so when the colonizers said we have a skybook and the indigenous people said oh if they have
a skybook we can probably trust them because a skybook will make them true men they will be true
right but in this case it was the opposite the skybook of the colonizers was phony
and that was the problem all together the colonizers didn't know that the skybook they had was phony
even though they partly invented it themselves that just helped them believe it wasn't phony
but the indigenous peoples wherever they didn't live their skybook
sort of uh with verity right um excellently skillfully
uh immediately their cultures would suffer damage from from themselves from internally
right and they could see this and that would correct in some way the process however slow it
might have been and however confused it might have become once cities were being made which were
very different from the origins of the original skybooks and that's where the story gets interesting
so here's the problem and if you look throughout history you're going to see very clearly the
thread i'm about to get at free people are a commodity for any colonizing people and all
the assets that might belong to any free people not as possessions but as rights and places of life
as ways of being in the world beyond far far above possession is this relationship not beneath
it possession is a lesser form of this relationship i am this place is what possession descends from
so the peoples who are living places they don't own them they're not conservators
they like the animals belong to with and as the place yeah these peoples and those places are
commodities for any organized culture or even just a city
and this goes way way back okay so like what you've got are one kind of people
that move about in cycles on the living land like the seasons themselves flowing
and they don't set up and destroy or wipe out areas of nature because they're going to return
to them and so are their children right so they don't set up cities they move and they move with
the spirit and the living calendar of nature and that little garden that's between me and seven
boxes right now so what happens is that um the people who don't do that who started making cities
right view all terrain is possibly available for them to own or at least dominate
and thus draw the resources from to fund the cities yeah and to fund not just the cities
but mountains and mountains of luxury that hide behind them in the castles right where the blood
of the future of living beings in places piles up like mountains invisibly in little coffers filled
with coins and jewels slips of paper numbers in bank accounts that's what it's really about
so what you've got is let's just make a little playground okay put a large area on some map
we make up and put seven cities there and then put one nomadic people that lives on the land
the seven cities are well apart from each other but they have war anyway because they
want to possess the terrain between them but along with that terrain put the living people
right a mobile nomadic people that live with and for and of nature in the land
yeah here's what's going to happen each of those cities is going to try to capture those people
and not only will they capture them they'll then use those people as slaves to extract the resources
from that land between all the cities but those people were the kind of guardians of right now
every once in a while one of the cities realizes the incredible value of these people that they are
actually the birthplace and home of the soul of humanity right but there's a deadly capsule forming
around them isn't there a kind of a shell a shell-like structure yeah forming in every domain of
their existence in their minds and their hearts their activities their thoughts their concerns
their priorities their values their lives their bodies their children their mothers
their fathers a shell-like construct
it's funny we have films like The Matrix and Things and we have these
ridiculous fantasies that wild technological advancement presents as progress
when in fact we haven't understood the most fundamental dangers of
the possibilities of our intelligence and what happens when the opposite of that becomes dominant
celebrated rewarded popular and expected so here's what happened with those people that were between
all those cities they were always trying to not be captured and to determine if any of the people
in the cities could be allies but they could never ever trust them under no situation could
they trust any of the cities for a simple reason first of all they were false cultures
and they had dead calendars inside them these people were the living calendars between the
cities they were surrounded by dead calendars inside them calendars of profit commerce war
or dominance you see so one of these people is the living calendar each of the other peoples
are inventing dead ones inventing dead skybook stories about time right so the the roaming
people had a skybook and the cities knew that the roaming people had really unusual amazing
powers that almost seemed supernatural this was because they were still human
and the people in the cities were terrified of this aspect of the roaming peoples you can hear
this all throughout history we don't have to call it magic it's something far deeper than that it's
something like nature or even more terrifying origin
so all of the walled cities tried to capture and enslave the wandering people between them in the
in the open living world and capture that terrain and use it to make you know pyramids and things
right and the wandering people had a skybook and in the beginning they never wrote it down
but eventually they too learned the art of writing not the ways we have in a very very
different way than what we have what they understood as writing was an entirely different art
than what we think of as writing and its product is nothing like what we imagine as writing
even though it bears a superficial similarity
so what they did was they encoded certain crucial parts
of their skybook
in writing but they did this in such a way
that it was both incomplete and deceptive now we can see that it's obviously incomplete for example
with the Hebrews and the Aramaic authors because you have to supply the vowels
from your mind right a living mind must complete any written word it's never explicitly there
so you won't be able to know exactly what any word is unless you speak Hebrew or maybe Arabic
or a similar language writing can understand that part of each word is missing and must be supplied
by a living mind if you miss that point by itself the rest of the book will turn to poison
every word is like this don't you think the book is like that and that's the poison shell
they made a weapon that was also a kind of medicine for their children
for their children playing with this book would enhance the verity of their remembrance
of their humanity in relationships with nature the divine the sky the earth the origins
the animals and the ancestors
but anyone else would read the words and get the poison shell and that should they believe it
and even if they didn't would influence them so dramatically that it would destroy their culture
they attacked the walled cities with a poison pill in the form of their own skybook
that book contains a shell that is lethal to cultures that take it up
because it destroys and reframes their relationship with the content and the context of human
and intellectual and spiritual existence but inside that poison shell recognizable to anyone
capable of shall we say passing its gates is astonishing content a very unusual nature
so we can see that the the bible
and even the new testament has this same kind of feature there's kind of a it's as if there's
a poison coating and if you get the coating you'll replicate the coating
and that coating replicated by humans as minds and lives and cultures and beliefs and rituals
will destroy the cultures that do that and so the extremely intelligent wandering people
both preserved their skybook and made a weapon against the cities they could never trust
that always were trying to enslave them and destroy the living land on which or own
living land on which they uh they dwelt and of course they were successively captured and enslaved
right this is actually the story in the bible it's very clear that these people were successively
captured and enslaved and may not have even been one people originally we hear you know even
in the bible which isn't the only story like this by the way but there are 12 tries and notice that
um the indigenous peoples on the north american continents refused they never made written skybooks
ever their skybooks were enacted in in um living writing with song and colored dusts that were
blown away at the end and things like this yes only their skybooks were only enacted and then
dissolved they lived in their hearts they lived in their ways of life they lived in their relationships
not on pages yeah so they weren't they were not prepared like we might imagine whoever the original
people that became peoples that became the jews were they were not prepared when colonists came
but the the people that were to become called the jews uh Hebrews so i guess some people
have uh what the kabiru i've heard this thing yeah so whoever these people were originally
before long before they were already in this problem for a long long time right they they were the
remnants of before the problem yeah and in some sense this kind of makes them god's true people
all the city dwellers none of them you can trust them they're rulers and morals and imperatives
and lifestyles and purposes just change randomly according to fictions and who owns what right
so you can never trust those people they can't even trust themselves they can't trust each other
so if there were like one people who were actually you know worthy of the idea of being
god's people it would be people who lived by some veritable standard that was at least uh coherent
and relatively consistent whereas the people in the cities
were almost like the opposite of dreams living as people with weapons in boxes
they didn't have minds they had the opposite of religion they didn't have intelligence
they had agendas of making and dominating things things like pyramids right things like whatever
the city we call uh babble was or perhaps er these cities enslaved all of the people
and dominated the land and changed the meaning of everything to a structured fiction
and we don't understand this history very well we don't understand it well enough to know
but this is what happened to us as children here we were born true and completely
just as those people just as the animals just as a tree absolutely true of nature
and we were born with the urge to walk in the continuum of that beauty
of authentic relationships with time and light with living beings with intelligence with each other
with the promises and potentials of the history of life on earth and our human birthrights
unfortunately we emerge into a construct an overlay and never having a place to establish first
ourselves uh or to you know be fully established in ourselves in nature as an intelligent
not just an intelligent being or person but an intelligent participant
in a family of intelligent participants in a family of intelligent real contexts
that are relationally trustworthy true beautiful and don't co-opt themselves for fictions at the
drop of a hat or the scribing of a word
and let me show you how good the jews were at making poison pills right
when recently some of the organized nations became concerned that the Iranian
nuclear plants could produce weapons grade uranium
they hatched a plot to destroy them and it was incredibly sophisticated they had to reach
computers down in bunkers that weren't connected to the internet possibly to any other computer
at all they had to reach computers that were connected directly to a semen centrifuge
and they developed a virus that looked like it came from the future it was one of the most
astonishing things that have emerged in this domain in the past 50 years called Stuxnet
and Stuxnet found its way specifically to those centrifuges and what it did was very amazing
it made the centrifuges report that they were operating functionally when tested
it destroyed the centrifuges and made them work in slowly and made them work in properly so they
couldn't produce the product they were designed to produce they made a virus that penetrated a
walled city and destroyed the intelligence that was overseeing the centrifuge right
that produced the energy that made the weapon inside the city just like they did long ago
Stuxnet and the virus its origins and purposes echo the intelligence of the original peoples
they carry within them the ability to penetrate the construct and use its own structure
to destroy it and what i'd like you to understand is that most of the religious texts but especially
the thing we call the bible is of precisely this nature it contains an overlay that all of the
cultures have been infected by it is the most contagious overlay i've ever seen the only thing
more contagious is the machine yeah and this overlay absolutely destroys and corrupts the
intelligences that take up the coating and replicate it in their structure
and thus the originators of this are at the very least the most adept players in the modern game
of culture wars in inside the construct but there are still those of us who ache to know
what it was like to be free human beings together with and for each other the history
of life on earth and nature we want to know what the origins and senses and faculties of our humanity
our organicity and our intelligence are really from and what they're about what we can become
and so we need the ability to see that language itself is like this language itself creates
this coating if our relationships with it place it in authority above our humanity above nature
above true relations in nature with and for each other right wherever any kind of construction at
all boxes us cages us tells us where to go directs us by making it easier to go in that direction
we're becoming part of the structure we're turning into what blocks not only the view
but in this case our own access to our humanity such that most of the people who live will live
and die never really getting much of a taste of what it means to be human or have a mind or have
a meaningful role in something that isn't just replicating the poison and it's funny you know
in all of our jobs we secretly know this we've secretly known it since we were children and if
we were all together in a theater and we just ask each other like do you guys all have a sense that
this is all there's like a really big problem that's everywhere right in front of everybody and
every single thing we do like you can't eat a piece of food without it being there you can't
pick up a spoon or go someplace or do anything without 17 dimensions of this construct impinging
on you photographing you analyzing you and so that we have to do it we're analyzing ourselves
for the construct now and the construct is asking us judge and analyze each other for the sake of
the construct right which is the explicit opposite of the imperatives that are our true origins in
nature spirit intelligence humanity and divinity the story of what happened at the tree
is the story of the danger of our capacity to invent
uh relational paradigms rather than discover and inhabit and advance them and you'll notice this
in our technologies we've made every kind of machine you can imagine making most of them
for killing or analyzing things or photographing them and we're not done yet we're going to keep
making every possible machine imaginable in every possible way imaginable but we don't understand
how to use language we don't understand we have no technical facility with the actual features of
representational cognition relational intelligence in fact those domains plummet backward and become
counterfeited in the shadow of our mechanical advancement and we can see this all around us
we should have had cars by now in 2015 that that had nothing to do with combustion engines
we're still using a browser to the internet which is our the metaphor of our minds right
is the browser that's the window to the whole internet we're still using the same browser in
2015 we're using in 1986 and no one even noticed that our minds don't work like an index card
right and that if if the window that we place in front of us looks like an index card
we're going to start making minds in that paradigm right naturally we emulate the we
emulate an orient to the technological metaphors we're exposed to unfortunately many of those
debilitate us where if we instead oriented around the metonymic and metonymic structure
of relations in nature and community communication and communion something very different would
occur something we've almost never seen notice this no culture is presently allowed to live
free on land no culture and it doesn't matter how far away they are the tentacle of the city will
reach them and strangle them and kill them and take their land and if they can't take it take it
they will poison it out from under them so that even in the united states the spirit of this endeavor
has reached into our own nation and poisoned the aquifers directly beneath our own people in
their own homes that they actually own and possess right so what we are doing outside we have to do
to ourselves first and if we don't do it first we'll do it soon thereafter and any nation like
this is completely absolutely untrustworthy they cannot be human they are mostly overlay with
some objecting humans helplessly spectating within them those cultures are pre destroyed
and they're pre destroyed by fake skybooks or by putting a poisonous overlay on a veritable skybook
the whole fiction on which our nation is founded tells us in very crude limited and declarative
terms a few things about what we should and should not do together from this we've developed a
some terrifying chimeric nightmare of billions of little processes that just destroy everything in
sight while appearing to be effective and intelligent in some incredibly narrow and fictional perspective
they generate the problems that they pay themselves to resolve with our blood
and the blood of life on earth the living places just being literally wiped out
so you can see how toxic a bad skybook is and even science hasn't given us a good one
and in fact provides us with the materials unfortunately for the cities and the city people
to prosecute their relatively insane agendas in ever more sophisticated and deadly and exciting
to them ways by examining some of this together today we've made a hole in that overlay we might
not know what's inside that hole yet but we can see how the structure is working and we can see
the difference between our authentic possibilities of humanity community cooperation intelligence
the actual imperatives of our souls and birth right and we can see the difference between that
and all the constructs of language and opinion science and authority knowledge government law
fake divinity quote religion unquote quote insight unquote and let us include the new age the
conspiracy theorists and everyone who's placed a fantasy of some other sort over the overlay and
that relationship between us our origins nature and reality yeah because that's not the right way
either that's just replicating the first problem making a second fake overlay that makes it all
look like a fairy tale magic thing is definitely not going to be of any use at all it will duplicate
and exacerbate the problem but understanding and discussing this together and learning how to see
through and be through the overlay together right will give us the opportunity to discover what it
might mean to be free intelligent alive exploring human and connected in ways that go far beyond
anything the constructs that we serve and live in would survive let alone allow
