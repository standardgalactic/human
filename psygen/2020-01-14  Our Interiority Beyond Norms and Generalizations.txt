and there's a lot of activity here
although at our scale at the macro scale the scale we live at
a lot of the activity is invisible
because it's happening in other temporalities at other speeds
so we do not see the very sophisticated and actually in its own way rapid growth
of the plants
what's happening in the plants is distributed
over a vast compared to to my body anyway a relatively vast
physical embodiment some of which
is invisible because it's under the ground
now these animals exist at close to our scale
so their temporality is intelligible to us
they don't they're not moving so quickly that they appear to be a blur
and they're not moving so slowly
that to us they appear to be still
so they are existing near our own temporality and yet
what comprises a lifespan for them
is very different what comprises from what comprises a lifespan in our understanding and expectation
now of course i think it's very important to carefully consider
that each living being
is unique and is distinct from our ideas about it
it's distinct from our expectations because most of our ideas and expectations come from norms
these are generalizations over classes of phenomena processes beings environments and so on
and these generalizations while useful
in some domains of our human thinking
and pragmatic or utilitarian orientations
these generalizations we use all the time in our thought and in our science
and in statistics and in making predictions and so on
can be extremely deceptive when we move from
the class of beings or phenomenon
to an instance an individual
this is a fascinating thing to remain aware of
and as a cognitive activist it's the kind of thing that i'm particularly interested in
what kind of thing do i mean i mean the difference between
our generalizations our norms
our expectations of phenomenon
and the actual uniqueness of a given being or situation or circumstance or question
when that question becomes about a specific array of related events
part of why it's fascinating is because the generalizations can be very deceptive
and what brought this to mind for me was the idea that we have a lifespan
that there's a unexpected span of life for an animal or human being
that span is generated from norms
and it's a generalization
some human beings die before they're born
some human beings die shortly after they are born
some human beings die in childhood some in their teens
so what we sort of mean by a lifespan in human terms is barring what we would consider to be misadventure
which is a strange word in and of itself since our life is
and our death we're so these things are so mysterious
it's very difficult to understand what would comprise misadventure
yet we have a normal meaning for this word
so every life every being every seed every bird every dog every bacterium
every form of life
while it resembles the class the generalization that we conceptually
apply to it and this is an overlay on our direct experience none of us can directly see bacteria
and we know these plants are growing
but they're doing it at a rate in a way that's not ordinarily detectable to us
technologies can render it detectable
and similarly with technologies we can see bacteria
we can also see into the development of processes and relationships that are otherwise ordinarily invisible to us
the expectation that things will be normal
is a very peculiar one and a dangerous one for many of us
that comes not only from language but from culture
and i have to admit that although i am a a biofile and an ethnophile
and i love diversity actually i love i just love
i love so many fascinating aspects of the living planet and world
and i'm even an anthrofile i love human beings
but i'm also
phobic about many aspects of our culture
our societies our technologies lots of these things i'm ambivalent about
meaning i have more than one feeling
so that while i can appreciate the seeming mechanical perfection of a smartphone or a jet fighter
i largely abhor their existence and automobiles and and so on and so forth
because to me they represent a vast misapprehension of the nature purposes and
necessities of living as a human being and being in the living world
relationally with integrity and awareness
so i'm conflicted
it's not necessarily it's not necessarily true that i'm hypocritical although it's relatively easy to see this
to see me this way because for example i'm using this device to communicate with you
to share in the life of the mind the soul and the imagination
i think here we probably have a coyote dig
though another animal conceivably a skunk or possibly a raccoon
could have made that dig
this is a buckeye that we might imagine is sleeping right now
we call it a buckeye because it produces
large seed bodies that resemble
could be understood to resemble the eye of a deer
and noticing that name answers a question for me
friend of mine and i ryan heavyhead were in the children's garden here a couple of weeks ago
and we found some things that resembled chestnuts
and we were we were curious about them
what they were and now just because of the name of that tree i think i know
the
i think i know what humans what humans around here call them
does that tell me what they are does knowing their name tell me what they are no
it links them to a couple of classes it links them to the class of something
a unique thing
things we can refer to in language and there are things that don't that aren't in that class
organisms vegetation trees seeds fruit
there's other ways we can classify them but you see that
to get to the concept or name or whatness of a thing in language we have to traverse a tree
that goes from everything to something to a class
to a subclass and so on
and
i can hear
and see a variety of avians birds having that word doesn't really help me know what they are
what happens is
well all kinds of different things happen with humans in language
there is no simple generalization for this but it's it's both very profound and sophisticated
and useful and at the same time very dangerous and confusing and blinding
our relationships with language and knowledge do not merely reveal
the facets of our experience to us they also hide them
beneath a veil of codes and representations and theories and ideas and concepts and noises
we can make with our face or write in letters with our hands
or our machines
so we have these these generalizations classes of things beings processes phenomenon ideas
tropes cliches
and we transmit them from generation to generation
each of us uniquely encounters
the manifold
of human representational consciousness in our lives and we each uniquely encounter
an experience and relate with the living world the universe the sky the seasons the sun the moon
stars ideas waking life dreaming life goals aspirations
suffering illness injury love anguish fear hatred
desire confusion isolation communion
and one of the reasons that norms are problematical for us is that
as human beings we're social animals
and there's an emotional interiority to each of us
that changes based on our situation and lifespan you know the span over the span of our lives
but but is highly responsive both to our perceived relationships with others
and our imagined possible relationships with others
and so we have most of us something often referred to as an inner critic
and the inner critic can be thought of as an amalgam
of the imagined thoughts perceptions and expectations not necessarily of actual others though those may
be included for example authorities in our childhood people who are important during our
development our parents our relatives our our siblings and so on but also imaginary others
also imaginary others possible others what would most people think
is an imaginal catalyst for the possibility of inner criticism and many of us struggle
with this so severely throughout our lifetimes that we are often in agony or misery or fear
or anxiety because we suspect
that something's wrong not so much necessarily
in our own interiority but in the relationship between our own interiority
and the expectations of authorized or critical others doctors judges parental figures and so on
and this is very tragic and painful for many of us and nearly all of us will experience
some degree of this suffering
where we will feel
where aspects of our own psyche will direct themselves against other aspects of our
native interiority our unique interiority
and focus painful judgments toward them
i've known people who suffer so severely from this that in conversation
they have to struggle to produce a sentence because critical reflections
are seething up from their subconscious and unconscious and conscious psyche
so that it it doesn't even seem reasonable or possible for them to emit language
that doesn't immediately invoke judgment
and again much of this judgment is imaginary
much of our fear in life is about things that aren't real that we'll never experience
or is comprised of reflections of previous experience that are no longer relevant
or relative to our current situation
and so the idea of norms generates in the human psyche
again i'm using a generalization there because this is going to be unique in every moment of every human
of every psyche if there even is such a thing as a psyche
and i'm getting near what i originally wanted to speak about but i'm
i'm approaching it in spirals at the moment
and there by the way is the gentle intrusion of my own critic
or my own critical concern i had a plan i'm not sticking to it
uh is my
is my oration properly organized and my disorganized
would someone else see this as disorganized would they be critical
am i pleased with the aspect of myself that determines whether or not what i am doing is being done well
now some of that's very useful because when it's gentle when it's when it's gently directed
that aspect of concern about for example i'll use the word quality the quality of my
activity or behavior or making creativity
when when the critic is gentle it both encourages me to proceed
and reveals to me
aspects of opportunity for me to improve
to make something that i already think is relatively good even better
now here we come to the fundamental division
which is between good and bad as if these were necessarily implicit
qualities associated with all possible reference but they're not
um once we learn to divide the world particularly conceptually
into good and bad we have a trap for the psyche for our intelligence for our emotions
for our for our narytmological consciousness the consciousness to tell stories
about what's going on in our lives
that one thing that one dichotomy good and bad is the source of much of our emotional and psychic
and mental anguish am i good or not is the fundamental question am i doing well or not
is the fundamental question around which the the the critical aspect of awareness
is orbiting the receptive aspect of awareness
and these two are reflecting back and forth in a relationship
as if there were a kind of psychic satellite
yeah but it's orbiting something what is that something
and we could say you know our identity our personality our being
our essence our mind our concern the last one is relatively good it's it's orbiting our concern
in a sense what we've become
momentarily compelled by our compulsion
but it can orbit other things like our inspiration our creativity
our humanity our masculinity our femininity
our intrinsic belongingness to the humans and norms or our otherness our aloneness
to humans and norms
so the idea of doing well
is generated the character of our experience of whether we are doing well or not at something
is generated by a vast array and maybe a multi-dimensional array
of historical experiences concerns habits
so that there's a there's a there's a degree of it that feels relatively
comfortable and useful and then there are degrees that feel wonderful
and ecstatic there are forms anyway if not degrees and there are degrees and forms that feel
miserable and agonizing and frightening
depersonating us so some positive evaluations and judgments and so on of our our our interiority
our being our self are encouraging and reassuring and if we are able to do something
of our our our interiority
our being our self are encouraging and reassuring and it's very joyful to share these together i
think it's important to remind each other to to be siblings to each other to be parents to each
other to be grandparents to each other when of course everyone agrees about this
to be kind and gentle and generous and beautiful siblings and peers and parents and teammates and
tribe mates and so on
but then there's the other side of that the side where we're motivated to criticize or attack
refute reject and i think this is where much of our turmoil comes from
we're many of us are rarely receiving healthy nurturing positive feedback
in the social and cultural world
and some number of us are are are sort of crippled in a way by
not even needing to be rejected by any particular external other we've interiorized
negatively oriented others and inside ourselves we have this this circle of
vicious critics and judges
that are imaginal
forms of what if what would other people think what would so and so think
of course most of the time
the vast majority of other people are not thinking about us
99.999 they're not thinking about us but we imagine what normal quote unquote people
would think and here's where the generalization gets weird because there really aren't any normal
people we might be able to say there's normative behavior we can observe normative behavior behavior
that sort of falls in the middle of the the range of possible behaviors but even that the idea
that that's normal or good is really worth questioning deeply yeah there's no reason to believe
that normative behavior is ordinary or good except that it matches a statistical gradient right
and even that statistical gradient can be misfounded because what we will derive from statistics as
normal will depend upon our concerns and purposes in producing data from in deriving data from
observation yeah and this is very important to understand this when we derive data from
observation we're collapsing incredibly complex phenomenon into a tiny amount of a relatively
modest little array of variables some of which we get wrong we being a really weird generalization
what i mean is analysts right people doing the analysis
so once again we can see that the generalization is weird and if it weren't weird if our generalizations
were actually good we'd be able to really accurately predict what would happen to an individual
not to a group which is what statistics applies to primarily but to an individual
and this is where perhaps i will begin to speak a little bit i have to consider it now i've
i've established a path accidentally today that i wasn't intending to and now i have to decide
whether i should continue along the path that i'm on
or switch to the path i had planned
and i don't know what to do
so
i'm going to circle back to the beginning to where i began speaking and just notice
that the actual life experience of a given organism is wildly unpredictable
the fact that a human egg can be fertilized does not mean it will be born the fact that it is born
does not mean it will survive the fact that it survives birth does not mean it will survive
its first year its second the first day of its second year so on so forth we don't know
there's an incredible
profusion of mystery about every aspect of existence and identity
to be born as a human being
is a very it is a situation fraught with mystery opportunity
to be
suffering
all of the features
of existence
that we are all uniquely familiar with
and we have these ideas about norms
but when you look
those are those are clusters
those are clusters within a storm
incredible diversity
and i think we should be able to flip our perspective over
so that that diversity has precedence
right if we do that suddenly the critics are voiceless
for they know nothing of diversity
most of them they are the produce of the idea that things should match norms
by the way the things should
as if there's some extrinsic authority imposing form on phenomenon
and when form escape that imposition they're bad or wrong
and one of the things that's really interesting about whether something is good or bad
is that this idea which is one of the most dangerous ideas we'll ever encounter
and one could argue that
one of the fundamental problems for human consciousness is framed
in the story in our in the english bible
of genesis and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
apparently everything was pretty going pretty well
until at some point
one of the original gender pair of human beings
approached a very special tree
that they apparently had been admonished
to neither approach nor touch nor eat from
now this is a very complex story and it's a story that i'll save most of my
exploration of for another time
but this tree is supposed to be in the midst of the garden of eden
and that midst kind of means in the between
it's in the between of all things
yeah and if you go into the between of all things and you make a cut
and you say these things are on that side of the cut these other things are on this side of the cut
this side is good that side is evil well now you're in boy are you in trouble you're in a problem
now ordinarily we are trained to evaluate phenomena
whether they are good or not a lot by feelings does it feel good does it not feel good
does it hurt does it help is it nourishing is it toxic
is it gentle is it harsh
do you feel more alive or do you feel like you're being killed
and all of these criteria are relatively natural to our minds and humanity
and yet there's a problem with good and evil for human beings
and the problem is really significant and important if we want
if we want to understand something fundamental about the nature of good and evil
if we want to clarify a bit this ancient problem for us
and by the way after we discover good and evil things go all wonky for human beings
according to you know this story in the bible which is probably actually a fragment
of a really ancient story and there's lots of reflections of very similar stories
in indigenous cultures that had nothing to do with the bible at all
though not all cultures have a story about the introduction of good and evil
many of them i have heard stories like this many of them i have not
i have not heard stories like this
but one of the most profound features of this conflict
the hawks are harass i think the excuse me the crows and ravens are harassing hawk
and the camera probably won't reveal this very well
but this is this is almost a perfect trope
the black corvids appear to have
decided that the brown raptor is bad
or at least shouldn't be allowed to just be where it is although it was a brief harassment
and they left pretty quick and there's some other crows and ravens around
who they have alerted about the the location of the hawk probably a red tail
but then they just kind of went off to do their own thing
that probably means that i mean there's lots of things it could possibly mean millions of them
but one of the ways that i think about what i just witnessed is that the specific location
of the hawk is not particularly a problem it's not in one of their roost trees it's not in a tree
that's in their territory so to speak or territory they understand to be but they should be protective of
and so really they primarily let the hawk know that we know you're there
and they let each other know that there's a hawk nearby and then they kind of went on to do whatever
they needed to do i've seen this behavior many times
so one of the fundamental features of the good and evil dichotomy
something that we don't usually think of
when trying to understand whether some we you know whether we perceive something as good or evil
good or bad so on so forth is time
most of us i i suspect there's a vast generalization there i met very very few people who would claim
or could demonstrate that they can see into time time is the dimension in which our
perception is extremely limited it's limited to right now
there are as as you go forward from right now presuming that there's a forward and backward in time
which i think probably is deceptive but it's it's a natural result of our common orientation
and thinking about time
and i do believe that it's possible for human beings to to see into time the way we see into space
i can see what is ahead of me right now if i continue on this path but if i turn
what is ahead of me changes yeah so whichever direction i turn in determines what is ahead
and there must be some corollary to this peculiarity in our relationship with time
i think and i suspect it's possible for human beings to see into time i also suspect it's very
dangerous for a number of reasons that i won't hear elaborate on one of which i'll mention
is that it can generate feedback of a peculiar kind that can be very difficult to handle cognitively
but because we can't see into time it's very difficult to tell whether an event is good or bad
we can tell in the moment that we don't like it or that we would not want it to happen
we would not choose it this way we would not like it but we can't tell what the
sequelae what the consequences will be for anything that we judge is good or bad
at least in only a very small subset of cases that we don't like
small subset of cases is it likely that we can determine whether something is fundamentally good or bad
and again good is associated with life giving bad is associated with life removing right
in general
so because we cannot see into time we cannot tell what the ontological outcomes of an event are
surely i do not wish to be injured yet if i am injured it changes my life path
and every you know we most of us many of us drive drive vehicles and at least in the united
states we because we drive vehicles we are subject to traffic signals every one of those changes
where we will be at what time in the future one could imagine that our lives are actually
composed by our relationships with traffic signals if one were so disposed
and it's not entirely untrue it's just not the only thing going on but certainly a very weird and important one because
if my parents had not been subject to the very specific traffic signals that they were subject to
it's very difficult to imagine them meeting right so am i the result of the activity of my parents
interactions with traffic signals it's hard to say no but that's not the only variable
it's just a really important one and i find that a kind of terrifying thought right it's not only
terrifying we can choose our orientation and our purpose in examining it but it's a really weird idea
the traffic signals determine who who gets which eggs get fertilized and by whom and so on
and human beings right i once wrote a with a friend of mine gary paulini i once wrote we together composed this story about a man who had noticed this phenomenon and and used to go to the traffic signal every day to read the future
it was called traffic signal man and it was composed we improvised the composition over about an hour and recorded it and i think there's actually a recording of it somewhere on a cassette tape in my in my special cassette box
we are particularly susceptible to signals i can hear the signal of a machine
there you see once the signal was established and began rhythmically reproducing i expected it to continue
the moment that i noticed it it disappeared
is that good is it bad i don't like that signal i'm not partial to having
the noises and effects of machines intrude upon my my senses my sensorium i don't like them i'm a
canofobic in that sense and i'd like to avoid them in general but there are exceptions so our machines bad
we make evaluations primarily based on habits okay another similar signal by the way those are both the signals of car alarms right
so someone's machine is in a state where it's been programmed to produce an alarm because it has been disturbed the idea being that the alarm will drive off thieves and alert others who might be protective of the machine
when i first moved to san francisco it was extremely common to be awakened at two three four five in the morning
by car alarms not just one many of them just going off and going off and going off
and that was bad
now it could be that there were results of that happening
that were important
i can't tell for sure
the knowledge of good and evil is at best incomplete but we should be aware
we should be aware
we should be aware that because we cannot see into time
so
determining whether a specific thing is good or bad
is profoundly difficult if not impossible
that doesn't mean that the local the temporally local felt sense of goodness or badness should be doubted
but the intrinsic sense should be questioned in many cases
i think it's useful we know for example placing placing food in my mouth i can tell is it too hot is it hurting me
immediately that's a felt sense of if it's too hot
that's a felt sense of i need to change my relationship i might have to spit the food out and if it's not hot enough
that could also represent a problem if i choose to approach it that way
it's very complex but i do want us to be aware that the intrinsic sense of goodness is that it's very complex
intrinsic goodness or badness of some specific event is probably a myth
we can't tell because we can't see the future we can't see with the sequelae we can't see the consequences
and something that initially seems bad something we would absolutely avoid
could turn out to be profoundly fortunate
this same bird was in this same place
yesterday eating worms at right around this same time
had the car alarm not continued if the car alarm had not continued
i would have been on a different path and i would not have seen this bird here today
it's hunting worms because the worms are easily available in the very moist
grass but it could be eating other things as well not merely worms
i think the it's clear that the grass is moist
because the bird
is shaking its face
when
how close will it let the humans approach not terribly although much closer than i thought
had the the car alarm not continued i'd have been on another path
and eventually i became concerned because i don't want to disturb those people who are
watching my video with two or three minutes of blaring car alarm
so i changed my path but right when i changed my path
the car whose alarm was going off began to move previously had not been moving
so someone was driving a car whose alarm was going off
and just as i changed my path the origin of the alarm began to move
and soon departed my proximity none of this was predictable to me
was it normal
well we'd have to survey a whole bunch of car alarm situations to determine that question but
then what we would find out would be about the cluster qualities of clusters rather than the
specific situation was it good or bad again the specific situation and the cluster
revealed different
windows into
whether it was a positive thing or a negative thing and our orientation
in thought and and felt sense and perspective and purpose
are crucially important
in the process
of making a determination
for those of us who have an experience very troubling inner criticism
um
we may have learned to expect cruel or depersonating painful judgment
from someone or some organization whom we needed
to have a positive relationship with in order to be healthy
and eventually when this goes on long enough or if it starts early enough in our lives
we begin to mirror it
in the sense that we form inward psychic organs that take on this role
and that can be tragic and painful and vicious similarly when we are positively when we receive
positive feedback and evaluation and praise and reassurance and inspiration we may similarly
form psychic organs that produce that feedback even in the absence of their existence in our
external world and relationships
i was largely lucky enough to be in the latter group though
we all will undergo transformations in these aspects of our interiority as we
proceed through our lifespan and into and out of new relationships
social opportunity and isolation and so on and so forth
analysts are generally concerned with norms
they want to know what is common what is uncommon
and maybe even get some numbers about that but when they get those numbers
their concerns and purposes will determine
what statistics they derive
what elements they examine how they examine those elements so on and so forth
so perspective and orientation
are not just involved in determining what is good or bad
but also what we think of as true normal or reasonable to expect
when we become aware of this consciously when we when we become consciously aware of the things
i've been circling then we have new opportunities to see through the blinding aspects of our
representational heritage in language and concepts and models and methods expectations norms
generalizations once we can see through that our consciousness rises above it in precedence
and that's really important because in that moment we cease to be merely subject to
the results of all of this behavior over human time and history and we can now
be selective intentionally consciously creatively in our interiority
in our inner selves and in our relationships we can become selective
about those features that we would like to include and those features that we would like to
reduce the precedence of the authority of we can decide
which aspects we want
to catalyze in our awareness and which and fertilize and pursue and which aspects we'd like to
we or we might be better off
allowing to drop away or to fall away or seeing for what they are right that these are not it's not
true that i am bad simply because there's some echoey voice of a mean authority in my mind
that's calling me names or judging me
i can let i can stop feeding that cycle of the produces that signal
or i can turn right i can reorient in such a way that that signal is not in front of me
but behind me it's gone it's going away
and i think we would all prefer
to have the clarity of insight that arises when we move
our minds and and our sense of personhood and our interiority
above all of these abstractions and generalizations and possible judgments of possible others
or possible societies imaginary critics
though on the other hand as i move the camera to my other hand
we might want to encourage and fertilize the voices in our interiority that are
positive and reassuring praising and
purpose whose purposes we trust to be good and true
healthful and wholesome
even bearing in mind that the acute division between good and evil good and bad
is deceptive because we can't see into time even bearing that in mind nonetheless
right now
not that hot and cold necessarily represent good and evil essentially in that model what i'm saying
is that extreme sudden extreme changes are very difficult to for organisms like us
in the temporalities we exist in in the temporalities native to our
to our consciousness and our and our size and our form and such
sudden radical transformations usually experienced as danger although not always
some of them are desirable
and in fact if the food is too hot suddenly in my mouth
the sudden radical transformation of getting it out of my mouth is important
when i first entered the garden it struck me
i had an entirely different topic in mind
but i was looking at the trees and it struck me that they're deeply rooted in the earth
in the in what we might imagine is the material the material the prime prima
materia of the world soil but their branches many of their branches are
way up in the sky in the domain we associate with origin and spirit
and even the non-physical and that was related to the topic i originally had planned to explore today
and it's entirely acceptable to me that i i didn't get anywhere near it
but the garden here is beautiful
and i have greatly enjoyed exploring
these ideas and perspectives with you today
and i'm profoundly grateful for those of you who have chosen to walk with me in your thoughts
and time in your life given the gift of your attention
and i would love to hear your comments suggestions ideas concerns questions
so please feel free to chime in
even though i realized that in our modern context of
short attention span theater sast very few of you will probably ever get near the end of this video
nonetheless i'm grateful thank you for joining me and i look forward to exploring
some of the fascinating depths of our humanity
our conceptual heritage and the non-verbally capturable essences
that are deeply associated with our minds and being in the world
bye bye for now
you
