So there's a, you can see one of the herons making some displays stretching
its neck call, pointing activity, there we go right there. There's just been some
dominance displays here at the Socia Tree in the, at Stowe Lake, the primary tree
where Blue Heron's nest and we had some birds chasing each other around a bit. Obviously it seems
to me these birds are males and they're getting ready to establish which nests will be used by
which birds and so they've been sitting nests. Right now they're sensitive enough that if other
males even approach the tree there could be some displays, combat display activity. But yeah,
there was some pretty good aerial chase scenes with a lot of calling in. You can see the one bird
making some, making some displays still. The largest of the males that are in the tree at the
moment is just kind of showing off his size and prowess and making it clear that he's willing to
you know, throw down if other birds don't properly acknowledge the hierarchy as it's being set up.
And here's the moon phase, we've got some of the evening co-contingent. Probably not going to see
any further activity from this tree at the moment. But I just wanted to capture some of the standing
display of the bird that is primarily concerned with the Surgeon's dominance. Now of course,
that's just the human idea. What's actually going on with the birds is I think much more
complex than merely the establishment of dominance and it's not merely combat either.
This bird at the top is the one who was being chased and that's the one for whom these displays are
being made primarily. But the bird at the top is courageous enough to return to the tree after two
chases and it's conceivable we could get a third chase but I think it's relatively unlikely at the
moment. There's at least eight possibly nine nests in this tree and this tree has been used for who
knows how many years at least at least a decade as the primary nesting tree for the local Great Blue
