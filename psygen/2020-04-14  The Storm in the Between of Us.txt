Hello everybody, I hope you're all doing relatively well in the science fiction of the present
moment of our civilization or our so-called civilization. You may notice I have a bit
of a froggy throat. That's pretty common these days. It's springtime, so I'm not taking
that as any sign of anything other than there's some mucous in my throat. I go for walks just
about every day. And I certainly prefer to walk around. I came here
to examine something, but I've discovered something extremely troubling accidentally,
though I was able to see it from far away. And I'll show you what that is in a little while.
I'm a very curious person by nature, and I tend to be curious about things that the majority of
people would ignore. So I notice small details throughout my entire life. I've been fascinated by
what we might refer to as anomalies. I've been both a fan of science as a way of learning and a
profound opponent of its applications as practiced by corporations and human supercultures and so
forth. Although when I was younger, I was primarily just a fan. I've read more than a few thousand
science fiction stories and many fantasy stories. And I've often believed, as I've said before,
that if there were going to be one of the places modern prophets might hide would be as science
fiction authors. But they hide other places as well. They hide sometimes in plain sight,
sometimes as other kinds of authors, sometimes as teachers, sometimes as artists.
I have a variety of things on my mind, but I'm still rather troubled by the discovery I made
after I began recording this video. The discovery I will share with you at some point,
without proposing too much of an explanation for it. I'm walking around the Bocci fields,
as my friend Ryan Firstdiver would say, this is very obviously a human attempt to take something
that is non-angular and form it into a rectangle. And my friend Ryan and I have both made videos
entitled Beware the Rectangles. So as I was saying before a phone call interrupted, my friend
and I, Ryan, Firstdiver have both made videos entitled Beware the Rectangles, in which we discuss
how humans produce these, shall I put it, peculiarly regularized structures. And in fact,
if you look around in your house or wherever you are, where humans are making things, what you're
going to see are things like this and things like this and things like those other things in the
distance. You'll see rectangles, a whole bunch of them. In fact, the rectangles will have rectangles
which have rectangles. In your homes, you'll see doors and windows and tables and sinks and
bathtubs and on and on and on books and video screens and smartphones and so on and so forth.
And what you'll see all over the place, there are rectangles. So many of them that we should be
suspicious, right? If it's that blatant and we never noticed that everything we were making was
rectangular pretty much like this sign right here and of course these ball fields and this sign
and this gate and the thing I'm recording on and all these things, they're all rectangles. These
buildings, the windows, everything, the doors, the carpets. It's not like we don't make anything else,
but we sure make a lot of rectangles and that's not a feature that you see in living places very
often. So right now, I'm between two rectangles and they're fenced and they're re-rectangled within
themselves, right? No one was satisfied to just make a rectangle or actually these fields are
relatively square though I suspect them being rectangular. No, they had to make rectangles
within rectangles like the fencing here and that door and this building and so on and so forth.
So that's not really my topic but I happen to be in this area and it's extremely regularized
and the more a thing is regularized, the more we might feel we can control or predict it. It's
its outcome and of course the problem with prediction is that the more stuff you kill,
the better your predictions look because living things, living environments, living places,
living beings resist prediction to varying degrees and of course most of what we call
prediction is based at least if it's rational on logic and probability and mathematics,
models and models always capture only a part of what's going on. There's no model that captures
the entirety of any phenomenon that I'm aware of but hey, if you know of an exception by all means
let me know. So right now, we're living in a time when our societies are transforming based on
models and some people are very upset about this and claim that the models can't be true.
I've heard claims that viruses don't exist, pathogens don't cause disease,
PCR testing doesn't work and you know, lots of other complex claims like this is all a plot to
take away our freedoms as if we had many freedoms before anyway because if we did, I gotta say,
we were not really practicing them much or the ways we were practicing them were mighty timid.
As I've said before, rights are not possessions. There's something that is either enacted and
defended or they exist only in language, right? They're just abstract ideas.
So, we are caught up in a variety of storms and the storms are happening between different
elements in a constellated system, or something we could think of in a constellated system,
of individuals and groups and subgroups and supergroups and the organs that the anatomy
of our society is comprised of and most of those organs are phony. They don't actually act like
the organs in the body of an organism or the features of an ecology that serve organ functions
we might analogize as being organ-like. By the way, from the place I'm standing,
you may occasionally hear people drumming far away.
Yesterday, I participated in a Zoom conference with a microbial pathologist
who specializes in mucosal pathology and who is working on,
is apparently on a team who is working on a vaccine.
I've just observed two people walk right by what I'm going to show you later,
which is actually pretty surprising, although I walked by it too. I'm just curious if anyone
will notice the thing that I'm going to show you later because it really stands out.
But so far, nobody who I've seen walk by it has noticed it at all, which isn't incredibly surprising.
In any case, yesterday I participated in a discussion with a microbiologist
that specializes in specific types of pathogens and in particular in how they enter the body.
There's a good analogy there to the human relationship with language, concepts, models,
ideas, probabilities, predictions, assertions.
In the beginning of the presentation,
there was a very peculiar slide that I liked a lot, and I may be misremembering it,
but I think I've got it right. In it were three cards that looked a lot like tarot cards,
but they were larger, and they were arranged horizontally from left to right,
and in each one of them, if I recall correctly, and I may not, this could be my own projection,
there was a figure of death, a skeleton, costumed in some way, uniquely in each card,
and it was reaching for or had its arm around a human being, and the first card on the left was
the state, and the card in the middle was science, and the card on the upper left,
since they were staggered, was religion.
And some of the things that I learned during the conference were very surprising,
not because they related particularly to science, but they related to another thing I'm
fascinated by, the evolution of human consciousness, how the consciousness that we have today evolved
over vast portions of what we suppose to be our history, we have no reason to believe that we
don't have a history, we think, in modern times we think that we evolved from some kind of animal,
eventually producing our most distant ancestors which continue to evolve both physically and
cognitively until they became us modern people, and that's a model, and it's a pretty new one,
it's probably less than three human life spans old, so that's a brand new model, and most of the
science that we think of as being profoundly effective and advanced and intelligent is less
than two lifetimes old, it's super fucking new. We only recently, we being researchers and popular
human beings, only recently discovered that half of the cells in our bodies, this is something I
discovered over 25 years ago, were bacterial and that was important, so half of us is not human,
right, half of us doesn't come from your parent's sperm meeting your, you know,
father's sperm meeting your mother's egg, half the cells in your body approximately don't come from
that origin they're acquired after we are born, and without them we don't, we won't live,
and for most of the, you know, the history of pharmaceutical technology, we've been really
busy attacking and genetically transforming in catastrophic ways that half of our human
bio, and it's analogous to what's going on in the world with, with nature, right, if you look
just behind me you can see this stuff, right, this weird, structurally stuff that, that actually
doesn't belong here. So, religion's a bit older, in fact religion is the oldest of the three,
most likely, the state is a relatively newcomer as well, but not as immature as science is,
not as new as science, not as young as science, and the state is something that emerged with
settled populations and city states and so on, and the idea of nations and this and that,
but one of the things that struck me very profoundly yesterday, a couple of the things,
was that I'd never really seen those three elements arrayed together meaningfully,
and I never really saw them necessarily as causes of death or rescue,
at least not in the way that I perhaps misinterpreted this image.
But what occurred to me was that most of us exist in a, in a, a between place, right, we are between
the state, science, and religion, and obviously there's, there's a context in which those cards
are placed, and that context is what we might refer to as nature, and so there's, you know,
we live in space in a way, and humans do strange things with space, right, and I'm gonna,
eventually I'll show you something rather terrifying that someone did with space,
the thing that I discovered when I got here, but we'll leave that for later.
So we live in space, and when we were talking about disease yesterday,
the, the microbial pathologist mentioned a couple of things that were really interesting,
and one of them was that the word that we use for one disease that I believe is caused by a parasite,
malaria, is literally, the translation is simply bad air, mal in Latin I think is, is bad,
and air is obvious, right, so malaria simply means bad air, and it's interesting that the pathogen
for malaria is, if I understand it correctly, and I may be wrong, primarily transmitted through,
you know, the bites of mosquitoes, and there's a, there's a disease, I may have it wrong, it might
be Tay-Sachs, but there's a, there's a genetic disease that we'd like to eliminate
that actually evolved to protect, one of its peculiar features is that it protects people
from getting malaria. So this bad air idea is very old, and in case it's not clear before we had
science, I'm pretty sure that this guy named Semmelweis was involved in developing the theory
that we had to sterilize instruments for surgeries and stuff like this. His mother died of sepsis
in childbirth, I'm fairly sure he died of sepsis in an insane asylum, but when he first introduced
the idea that pathogens were responsible for disease that resulted from surgeries including
childbirth, everyone thought he was mad, and they didn't believe that there could be anything
that you can't see that could possibly be causing. The deaths that they accounted, they just presumed
were the natural result of being subjected to medicine, which is kind of weird.
And so like many other pioneers in science, he was laughed out of the academy and, you know,
shamed and so on and so forth. Eventually, of course, people realized that if you just do the
thing he asked you to do, sterilize the instruments, the death rate goes down, math wins, you know,
obviously there's something going on with the instruments. By the way, they were using
instruments that they had recently used to dissect cadavers, those same instruments unwashed
in operations, you know, to assist women in childbirth. So they're using, and they thought that was
a great idea. Surely the future will show our own ignorance as moderns in a similar light,
in various domains of things that we believe to be true. And surely in some things related to,
you know, the nature of disease and transmission and so on and so forth, we live in the very early
days of science. No matter how advanced it may appear, no matter how seemingly miraculous our
technologies look, they are wildly incomplete and nature is unimaginably more sophisticated than
anything that we can possibly get a grip on with science or models or technology.
Roger Penrose, a brilliant physicist, once said recently, I saw a quote of his and he's somebody
who I find both brilliant and entertaining. He said something like, I'm a materialist but I object
to that label because it implies that we understand what material is.
And that's, that's a really intelligent researcher. But we are,
we are in the early days of science and most of what we've done with science
and even with our intelligence is make things, right? So we're really
sort of uncannily skillful at making objects like this smartphone or those cars or
this fence or these buildings. We're really good at making multi-component objects.
Hummingbird War. And we're good at making representations, we're good at making pictures,
right? Representations and objects are most of what we've done with our intelligence
and those might be the wrong fucking things to be doing with it. In fact, I'm going to suggest
blatantly that those things are a bad idea and will get us in lots of trouble, which should be
pretty obvious that that's been going on. I mean, people will say, well, you know, there hasn't been
a nuclear war yet. Well, I don't know. There have been 2,500 nuclear explosions since we invented
the atomic bomb. That looks about like a nuclear war to me. 2,500 nuclear bombs going off. Yeah,
that looks about like a nuclear war. Even though we didn't actually drop them on each other's
countries directly, we poisoned the environment for, you know, thousands of years to come.
And not just with bombs, but with chemistries and antibiotics and pesticides and so on and
so forth. We're really good at making toxic shit, apparently. And as a species, we're extremely,
you know, effulgent in our capacity to do so. We just want to make, like, billions of gallons
of pesticides, apparently, because that turns into this other weird representation we call money.
And money is, you know, a disease in its own right. But most of these problems go back to
a transformation in the kind of animal that we are. The transformation that I would argue
or suggest resulted in us becoming formally representational cognitive animals.
We formally, we have formal systems with which we represent events, phenomenon, habits of
distinction, habits of evaluation. And we have tokens. We produce tokens. For example, the token
for that thing there in my language is tree. And that's a really much more complex thing
than it appears on the surface. I'm really curious if this guy with a dog is going to be
able to pass the object. The dog noticed, but the man didn't.
The dog didn't pay a lot of attention, but I was pretty sure the dog was going to notice the object.
In any case, we have tokens. And the tokens are, they're framed in a tree-like structure
that begins with what I call a uniform at the top of the tree. A common uniform would be,
a uniform would be everything or the universe. And whatever you think about that thing at the
top of the tree, all the things below it acquire characteristics and meanings, denotations and
connotations, which are associations, from whatever you call the uniform. But there are,
underneath the uniform, there are these things that I refer to as holophores. And by the way,
this is my private, this is my, my private modeling language. A tree is one of the most
profound holophores because all human knowledge systems are based on it. And you could say,
well, the cloud isn't based on it. And I'd say, yeah, we could have a discussion about that. But
dictionaries, books, knowledge systems, grammar, word lists, we sort, we use trees
as a fundamental, like set theory, right, is tree-like. It's a fundamental basis from which,
you know, words break down into nouns and verbs and adjectives and propositions and, excuse me,
propositions and so on. So the tree is a fundamental model within human representational
systems, which isn't surprising. We spent most of our early lives as animals in some kind of
intimate relationship with trees. Our houses are made of them, our books are made of them.
They provide shelter and food and all kinds of astonishing things. In fact,
if you look right here, you'll see the bodies of trees, right, forming a barrier. And that thing
up there is probably filled with tree corpses. So we use tokens to refer to things. And our knowledge
in some senses becomes, it's the right word. Over time, a process happens in human knowledge
traditions and end human intellectual and linguistic behavior that I call artifacting.
And artifacting is a lossy compression technology where meaning and relationships and values
are lost over time as the tokens with which we refer to phenomenon become denuded of their original
dimensionality and richness. And I would argue that our relationship with technology vastly
contributes to this. But before we had technology, religion was a pretty good,
it was a pretty good analog of contribution to this, right? So
it's not my intention today to go deeply into this theory. This is a personal theory about the
nature of human representational consciousness and the problems that we have with language and
knowledge and ideas given our habits and our traditional ways of relating with formal representational
cognition. But what I actually was hoping to talk about today are kind of two things. Long ago,
when there was a problem, it was known or felt that it was some kind of problem in the between.
And it might have a cause and that cause might be, you know,
evil or some particular race of people or something that people that some people were doing or
something that some people were not doing, so on and so forth. But for example, part of the
reason we say bless you when someone sneezes is that a long time ago, when people walked near
trees, they would often sneeze. And so it was thought that a bad spirit lived in the tree
and caused, you know, a kind of little mini curse phenomenon that would result in a sneeze and a
sneeze was a way of trying to get the curse to go away. And, you know, this is a Western Christian
idea that became popular just as a kind of common social tradition. But before we had science,
the between of people and the wind and the space itself, right, the between, it's really important
this this idea of the between of the between is a dimension that we share. Because in case
it isn't obvious right now, there's a huge problem in the pathological between of human beings,
but also in the psychosocial between of human beings. And the problem that's that may very likely
exist in the pathological between I'm going to claim it does is producing or is actually a symptom
maybe of some other kinds of problems in the between like us wiping out just about everything
that lives and most of you know attacking most of what doesn't 24 7365 for the past 100,
150, 200 years. So the between is another word for the between is the environment.
And I would argue that some, you know, 80% of what whatever it is we might be
is directly inherited from that environment the same way that
um holophores metaphors and analogies similes and things inherit qualities from the structured
tree of meanings and ideas distinctions associations connotations
that they emerge from we emerge from the environment in a way not dissimilar to
how apples emerge from apple trees. So if we fuck up that environment and just obliterate it
wantonly for the sake of producing objects or money which does look peculiarly peculiarly
like tree leaves and has for a long time been printed on paper or made of metal
bad things are going to happen and they're going to keep happening and they're going to get worse
and worse and people will blame them on things that more or less have nothing to do with
their actual origins because in general humans are not famous for taking responsibility
for the consequences of behavior that should easily be understood to be either insane
in the not not insane in the sense of not clean although that too but no insane in the sense of
being an idiot right in in the greek sense a person who lives in a bubble of ideas
that can't be true it's not possible they are true and then
pursues and enacts their relationships based on these nonsensical dangerous ideas that are
the bad kind of crazy like our president right is the bad kind of crazy
so humans aren't very good at taking responsibility for the consequences
of various kinds of insane behavior and ideas and apparently many humans think that
the way that we live now is the way we will always live the way we have always lived
none of that is true it's not possible for that to be true
the way that we live now is explosively unsustainable and by explosively I mean a
process that becomes geometrically more unsustainable every time you do an iteration
so we're not going to keep living the way that we have been living and our societies and most
many of our fundamental principles of what we call our civilization
are abjectly at odds with both our nature and the possibility of our own intelligence
humans are not intelligent by you know ex cathedra by proclamation right they're either
intelligent or not depending on what they what degree of their potential intelligence they're
capable of enacting and in cultures like ours that percentage is very very small right you're
not likely to do something radically different than what everyone around you is doing and even
if you do it's going to be you know by by a relatively modest percentage you might act
five or ten or fifteen percent so to speak differently from the context you're immersed in
but most of us as human social animals we acquire our sense of role from our perspective of the
context and so within a given context that you know like the context of consumerism and capitalism
that we presently exist in or you know we may exist in other socio-religious or socio-political
or socio-philosophical contexts as well but we we we understand the nature and
opportunities available to us by looking at the context right and then
then deriving a role from what we see in that context and then enacting that role over and
usually you know we may develop that role but essentially humans are limited most of us
throughout our lives will be dramatically limited by the contexts the social and relational and
vocational contexts philosophical you know semantic linguistic by the context that we're
exposed to we're going to be severely limited and you know we've always pretended well these
contexts lift us up right these are advanced contexts they're not um if this was the best
we could do we sucked at doing good right in general um people say well like we've you know
wiped out disease or you know we've stopped having wars none of that's true we've invented
all kinds of toxicity in the in the environment we just sort of distributed damage everywhere
we could possibly hide it as a species and then pretended well things are getting better and better
and you know i've read the book factfulness right in which the author claims that our ideas
about how bad things are are based on mishaprehensions and the communication of ideas from like the 30s 40s
and 50s um to our modern ways of evaluating things without including the updated statistics
i get it right i'm not ignorant i can understand charts and that guy's belief was that actually
we're too ignorant to understand if we're just told so we have to be shown in images but there's
some truth to that like humans respond a lot better to images or images and language than they
do to language alone it's almost as if there's an aspect of our intelligence that can instantly
grasp images but has to work relatively hard to grasp statements and it depends on how well
they're crafted or if analogies are used or if metaphors are employed or similes because when
analogies and similes and metaphors metaphors are are used we tend to grasp things more easily
now all of the things that i'm talking about right now are stuff in the between we acquired
language by being born into a context where humans were using language all the time and
they were using it in ways that were well they might seem advanced if we decide to look at them
that way they're there are places in the behavior that have
gone retrograde right or regressed so while we have advanced in certain aspects of our thought
and behavior we have digre you know we have retrogressed we've gone backwards in others
we've gained value in some domains we've gained certain kinds of intelligence
but we've lost intimacy with the context of nature the living places the environment
perhaps our origin the nature the essence of our humanity these things have been included
by our rush toward capitalism consumerism war object proliferation and ramified representational
cognition and all that's happening in the between
now the mal area the bad air right is is an idea about the between right it's it's people a long
time ago thinking something's wrong in the between of us yeah and maybe they were thinking we're
being punished right because often when bad things happen it certainly feels like a punishment
and right now what's going on is all kinds of confusion and in case it isn't clear we are at
risk in all kinds of ways we're at risk from all sorts of things our governments are
childishly retarded in general with very few exceptions um there the purposes for which they
were formed not only have they failed to accomplish those purposes they've done pretty much the opposite
they're catastrophically misprepared to do much of anything useful
and you know we're using forms of government that were invented in the 1700s in 2020 that's
a big mistake we no longer live in the 1700s there aren't like you know one million people
in the united states or 500 000 or something i have no idea how many there were when our
constitution was forged but uh it's really weird we've as as human beings have invested
this what i would might call our evolutionary potential in objects and representations and
machines instead of societies that would lift us to where we would start out at a position
where we were capable of both recognizing and enacting the incredible potential for intelligence
insight creativity nobility humanity that is our nature and if we don't build contexts
then empower that then we're going to be limited by their opposites and we will suffer continuously
generation after generation we will suffer the catastrophic results of having failed to establish
contexts that catalyze the finest qualities that we are capable of and bring as potentials to our
human births and lives and that's tragic when that happens but right now the between of humanity is
bubbling like a froth and there's all kinds of conspiracy theories and there's all kinds of
science going on and there's a reasonable terror that the relatively fascistic
aspects of our existing governments will use this as an opportunity or maybe even engineered this
as an opportunity to clamp down and really create the kind of science fiction nightmare
that George Orwell and others of his ilk attempted to warn us about in his book 1984
which was actually about 1948
so the common people have not yet learned to establish intelligent mini societal networks
among the ordinary population skillful teams capable of
of deriving useful intelligence and even manipulating directly manipulating the structures they're
afraid are about to manipulate them like puppets we've made thousands of movies about people who
do this just in case this isn't true i mean just in case you think what i'm talking about isn't
possible i mean humans love movies about small five to seven person teams they just walk into some
context manipulate the hell out of it and walk out with the money that's something humans are
absolutely capable of doing but instead of doing that we've been making movies about it essentially
writing stories about it we are really interested in representations we love representations
and most of our representations are about things we are hungry to participate in but we are sold
the representations and those kind of settle that hunger a little bit much in the same way that we're
sold porn instead of intimacy mcdonald's instead of food vitamins instead of nutrition so on so forth
so we're living in a time when representations replace the things they represent
in our human experience in daily lives and that activity happens it arises in the between
of individuals groups societies corporations nations and so on i wish you could see all my
hand movements i'm making some great hand movements but they're not evident at all in this camera
right i'm making them to myself um someday i'll get a better camera but for now hey
so i'm interested in the between for a number of reasons and one of them is that i've discovered
that the idea of individuals is an extremely limited idea with a relatively poor scope of
applicability and it may even be it may turn out to be that the idea of distinctions themselves
have a falsified precedence in that what's really going on is that there's just one human being
on earth so to speak um there's just one network of human minds of which we are all
exponents right right we are expressions of that rather than we're a bunch of individuals and when
you look at it look at us as a group we present these properties that we can analyze or you know
count so what i'm trying to get at is i have discovered that when i am with others there is
this potential that was always kind of i was aware of it subconsciously as a child in play
but i never was able to consciously articulate it which is that when i'm with one other person
and we are really enthusiastically engaged we form a position above either of us right
and we play back and forth at enhancing that position and then that position communicates
advances what appears to be our individual intelligences somewhere far below it right
and so we have the capacity essentially to produce a superposition of intelligence even
with just two human beings even over 10 minutes right it doesn't it doesn't require any
sophisticated technology or understanding humans do this naturally whenever they're
enthusiastic enough an enthusiasm does seem to be a key ingredient whenever they're enthusiastic
enough to embark on this adventure together and it's super exciting um at least all of my
experiences of it are and when when when that experience is over and i go back to my ordinary
seeming individuality it's like part of me disappears and i i eventually learned to do
something similar when i'm making these videos instead of actually having a specific other
person or other group to interact with i imagine right that others of like mind and interest
are with me right now and i'm i'm playing from the superposition into my uh
into my my talk and that's why i'm excited and this is what excited speakers do in general
right um they don't always have an audience right in front of them certainly when they're
composing right authors and and other people musicians and so on they don't have an audience
there yet they're imagining an audience in the future with which they'll relate and the audience
wants to be lifted to that superposition by the music or the the exposition or the poetics um
they want to go higher together you know humans naturally have this hunger and and what i'm trying
to say is that we need to do something other with this hunger than what has been common for so long
and we need to do it together with and for each other and the history and future of life on this
world in other words we need to do it for a purpose that we can all immediately understand
and directly validate is noble yeah because when we're excited about something that's truly noble
that enthusiasm becomes a force like lift for that the functions like lift does for aircraft or
birds for a variety of aspects of our intelligence that ordinarily are crawling around in the dirt
um trying to you know accepting representations instead of flight yeah together
the between of the humans right now is in all kinds of storms and
there have always been theories about conspiracy
it's not my intent to dismiss them that would be egregious by the way because
i'd be i'd have to dismiss thousands of things i haven't even looked at um at the same time there's
a specific aspect of our human intelligence that is vulnerable to what i will call let's see what
i'm going to call this it's vulnerable to a connectivity gambit in the sense that we can see
some effect occurring and then somebody can pause it or assert some cause or hidden cause or
agenda or hidden agenda on the part of some person or people or group
and the part of us that um we have an aspect of our intelligence that i refer to sometimes
differently um one of one of the aspects we have is a vetting sentinel it decides whether
something is likely to be true can be true is impossible or not and if that thing gets distorted
if the vetting sentinel gets distorted we become vulnerable to all the problems but there's another
sentinel that i call our threat sentinel and when those two things get together the threat
sentinel and the vetting sentinel when the vetting sentinel fails there's certain kinds of fear
and concern that for some human beings at least some group um if you just amplify the fear enough
the thing they're afraid of simply becomes real uh in their minds right they're absolutely assured
that it's true and so we have this vulnerability and it's one of the weaknesses of the sort of fake
societies that we're participating in presently is precisely this we are easily manipulated on
mass and individually in general um just luxuriously touching my face out here but
i haven't touched anything so i'm not worried about it uh
our modern situation places us in a context of incredible vulnerability to a wide array
of what for lack of a better word i'm just going to call information diseases
and some people will argue well you know the idea that there's actually a pandemic that's
the disease that we're that we're you know contagiously being affected by there's no real
pandemic you can't see the virus nobody has shown us the actual virus and then used it to cause
the same disease at least that they're saying we have there's people you know making all kinds
of wild claims people's threat sentinels are totally disoriented their vetting sentinels
are mostly shut down because once you amplify threat enough the vetting sentinel starts to fail
and these are just words for aspects of of our cognitive anatomy right so we're in this situation
where there's a a storm in the between of the humans and part of that storm is that
we've been told and i believe that there's a virus circulating that's causing a respiratory
syndrome now it may turn out that the actual causal situation is much more complex than that
right that there are a suite of co-factors that are producing the effects that we're seeing
in my view that isn't entirely unlikely but i'm not a virologist or an epidemiologist
in their view they're looking at it specifically so far as a viral contagion caused by a very
specific virus that they have isolated RNA from whether or not they have produced
and examined whole viral particles and used those particles to replicate illness in an animal model
but the storm that's happening in the human cognizium right in the network of human minds in
which we all participate and of which we are all elements that storm's gigantic that thing has
hundreds of thousands of maybe millions of different components and that whole stew is just
bubbling right now right and nobody knows what to do there's not there's a lot of energy in
that bubbling if we had some good idea about what to do and i'd like to suggest that forming small
tightly knit human teams of experts capable of understanding the array of dangers that got us
here understanding the threats and opportunities implicit in representation representational
cognition the kind that we depend on rising above like protecting us from the dangers
taking advantage of the opportunities and directly manipulating the contexts that we
have so far been subject to we're being manipulated by them i'm saying we should manipulate those
contexts intelligently heroically and nobly together just like a team of trustworthy
nobly motivated and intelligent heroes would do in some story we might write
a story not entirely unlike for example um Tolkien's work
most of us are frightened and we feel vulnerable and many of us have lost our our livelihoods
suddenly and there's no clear understanding of how we're going to survive without those
it really looks bad
in the sense of
any kind of predictive by the way our threat sentinels they look at the future right they
do predictive modeling of threats and often they get it totally wrong and sometimes they
lead us directly into the threat we're afraid of because they malfunction that way mine does
occasionally um so we need to be really we have to develop intelligence about these aspects
of our potential intelligence as humans we have to learn about their their vulnerabilities and
their strengths and we have to employ them in such a way that we take advantage of their strengths
and we can have some resistance to their vulnerabilities and it's a challenging task
believe me even in my own with my own mind it's quite challenging particularly alone
because i need the input of other intelligent skillful creative people to correct my to to
make quick progress along you know toward that goal i can make modest progress by myself
if i'm not overwhelmed by other concerns but when i'm overwhelmed by other concerns i can
regress very quickly um my threat sentinel will malfunction my vetting sentinel will
malfunction they become overwhelmed right
now the between is actually the thing that that stuff we call spirituality is about in case it
isn't clear it's about the relation the relational dimension that joins all souls
all living beings all living places and not just those local to us in time or space no
that joining is trans temporal it's beyond time and has little to do with location although
so from the perspective of an individual in a specific place and moment
in waking life it looks like the impact of time and location are extremely important
and in that specific dimension i won't say they aren't what i will say is that that's wildly incomplete
and something else is going on um that our dreaming mind or our creative mind the creative
aspects of our intelligence are much better equipped to sense relate with and understand
i can't tell where the origin
of the situation uh first of all i can't tell what the scope of the situation we're in now is
i can view it as the pathogen and the responses of states and governments
to end corporations and extremely wealthy individuals and extremely poor individuals
their responses to the situation now obviously the situation is going to breed predators
obviously there's going to be power grabs some of those power grabs could turn out to be catastrophic
we could see both things like very severe examples of martial law
we could see people turn states into prisons we could see
revolution we're likely to see the full gamut of the possibilities of human social and psychological
and economic behavior right now right we're if you want to study humans you're at the best
place you've ever been ever you know in the past few thousand years because right now we're going
to see the full gamut of possibilities and some of those are going to be noble but in general
we can reasonably expect that a large number of them won't be noble they'll be ignoble uh and we may
be called to give answer
to abuse and injustice together
it seems likely we will and ironically that idea is is part of what is driving the conspiracy engine
right and most of what's going on in that engine is not only wildly unintelligent
or even impossible it's completely misdirected right it it takes the human desire
to see through oppression and scams
misdirects it and and ironically produces the thing it's pretending to address or resolve
and this is really common with with human you know psychological and sociological and economic
behavior irony is everywhere so
most of us are not probably feeling equipped to take advantage of the opportunities
that are currently present to speak for myself i am poorly equipped i'm trying to do
something useful in this you know with my time
but eventually it's not going to matter whether we feel equipped or not
eventually we're going to be faced with either relatively stark or relatively beautiful options
and that polarity depends on what we do now with and for each other how we prepare
what we're preparing to become in a way not dissimilar to how the biology of a caterpillar
transforms inside a chrysalis right it's not preparing to become
a slug or goop it turns into goop and then it reforms and becomes a flying thing
so i think we're in the kind of goopy phase at the moment whether we'll become a flying thing or
not depends a lot on if we're capable of forming intelligent intentions together
and if we can learn how to enact those intentions in ways that lift us out of the
incredibly confused and almost completely misdirected societies and contexts
to which we become habituated
i want that result i'm willing to work at that result with others of like mind and heart
i want to make of this an opportunity that can lift us beyond the incredibly
toxic contexts activities and purposes that have become the hallmark of our species in modern times
i don't know if i would say that i am hopeful that that we can do this
but i am determined
to move in this direction and to explore and if necessary to pioneer in this direction
with others of like mind and spirit
so i'm just going to give a bit of a uh around about here for a moment
before i show you the rather troubling thing that i discovered earlier
so i've watched so far many people walk past the very troubling thing i discovered when i got here
and i'm not sure what to do about this thing or if i should do anything about it
in fact i think i'm not going to show it
instead i'll make a separate video of it
and not let that shadow here intrude maybe well
i hope we will all climb a few rungs up the ladder of our human potential during this crisis
but i'm not naive enough to expect that that will occur without some relatively
significant impact
all blessings to you
bye for now
