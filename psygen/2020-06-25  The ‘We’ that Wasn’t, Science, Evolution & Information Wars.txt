So real quick, I'm going to clear up a couple things from my previous video.
In the beginning, I was going to talk about the capacity for people to wildly misinterpret
what the very little they may have come to understand about some natural phenomenon.
And I was talking about hymenoptera, and there's a couple of things I want to go back to in
that discussion.
Just to be clear, hymenoptera are the bees, ants, and wasps, social insects.
And I've learned astonishing things from watching them.
And one of the most important things I've learned is that, first of all, they represent
super organisms in E.O.
Wilson's terms.
And there's a great book by him on that topic.
He's a genius.
I love this guy.
He's taught me so much.
Him and his colleague, Hall Dobbler, who've written the social insects, the ants, super
organism, all these books are fabulous.
And though I've studied hymenoptera personally in a very intimate way throughout my life,
occasionally by having the crap stung out of me, I could never have hoped to have learned
many of the things that they'd become aware of.
Now, of course, some of their knowledge came with a price.
Science studies, quote unquote studies, phenomenon often by dissecting it.
I had more than one friend who wanted to be a biologist and when they realized, or even
a marine biologist, when they realized a good portion of their work was likely to be
killing and dissecting creatures from the ocean, they were just, this is ridiculous,
which is good.
They realized that obliterating something isn't the same as studying it.
To study a thing with integrity, I believe, it generally means to have an intimate co-beneficial
relationship with it.
And I'll come back to that in a minute because I'm in danger of losing my point, as I did
yesterday.
So I made a couple of statements, one of them was the hymen refers to what we call in colloquial
terms a woman's maiden head and it's something that's often, but not always, penetrated or
pierced or torn permanently when a woman first has intercourse.
Now of course, and I said, and I hope that many of those events are consensual, I would
want them to all be consensual if that's how a woman's hymen is penetrated.
But many women who are, you know, who ride horses or engage in gymnastics or possibly
through other means, their hymen is penetrated in some other method that doesn't imply they
were, you know, raped or even that they're no longer quote unquote a virgin in the sense
of never having had intercourse.
So I just wanted to clear that up real quick, delicate topic, no pun intended.
And then the other thing was I was about to tell a story from the news feed and it's funny,
I think I may actually remember the book in question.
A friend of mine was claiming that a book she had read about the about it was sort of
anthropomorphizing the bees, wildly celebrated the male bees, which for anyone who knows
anything about bees, the male bees have a kind of a complex existence, right?
On the one hand, they get pretty much taken care of without, as humans think of it, without
having to do any significant work, right, they are fed and coddled until the day that
they fly in the mating flight, after which they are roundly ejected from the hive and
become prey for predators or just die because they're no longer being fed.
So in this book, there was this wild scene where the females were making a living staircase
out of their body to welcome the arrival of a male back from flight and blah, blah, blah,
blah, and it was just insane because obviously the person who wrote this book knew very little
both about bees and about the way the sort of, if I've got this right, the haplodiplo
aspect of bee biology works and of course being a bee is a really kind of a strange
thing because it's like the pedigree, it's pedigree-oriented, they're genetic, so there's
the soma and the genome, right, and the bees are the soma and the queen represents the
genome, they're all her genetic children and this takes different forms in different
families or clades of hymenoptera, for example Yellowjacket Queen's Battle, Paperwasp Queen's,
they battle around just shortly after nest founding and the winter undergoes metabolic
changes and becomes fertile and her children will eat the eggs of all the other queens and so
what you're seeing when you see a wasp nest, or also the queens can overwinter, right, whereas
the rest of the hive dies, when you see a wasp nest you're seeing the living instance of a vast
unimaginable history of combats in those creatures who display this biological framework.
You're seeing something that goes back perhaps millions of years, right, you're seeing the
living face of warrior queens going back millions of years and if you think there's nothing
interesting about that, I'm going to have to wonder about how you arrive at the quality of
interesting, but I'm also going to understand that each human being's scope of interests are
going to be naturally unique both to who they are and to their history, their relationships,
the contexts they're in and this is so often forgotten when we try to judge or evaluate a
phenomenon, we, we, the fictional we, judges and evaluators are often inclined to suspect the
qualities are implicit in individual organisms rather than being emergent from histories
and contexts and in most cases there's going to be a little bit of both, but the latter one is
often dismissed and so it's very difficult for some of us to understand how people can hold,
how specific people can hold ideas or opinions or feel militant about subjects that we find to be
either grossly misfounded or the unfortunate result of having been kind of weaponized against
people in general and the specific people who take them up and circulate them like a disease.
Now of course part of the real problem around this in the current moment is and I want to,
I'm going to go back to study, I'm just bookmarking that for myself, part of the problem in the
current moment is that there's this idea of a we and I talk about this very often it's one of my
pet issues. If you and I have agreed and in a sense if you're watching this video that has happened
right because I've done my part to try to produce material that I hope will be thought-provoking
and insightful and revelatory in the sense of revealing something that's difficult to otherwise
see and you've signed up for the attention span that you're willing to devote. Thank you for doing
so whatever that span may be and so there's an agreement there. We've come to an agreement
and it's a significant agreement because
each you and I in our own ways we've decided to devote some of our precious time
and hopefully the outcome is mutually beneficial and nourishing and we both learn.
Part of what's happening when I make these videos is not that I am just
regurgitating ideas and information I have already digested. This is part of my process
of learning and understanding and when I don't have near at hand people who I consider relatively
intelligent with whom to have discussions like this I have them with an imaginary friend
and if you're watching this video you are you have chosen and again thank you for being so
patient and doing so you've chosen to embody that imaginary friend and I make these videos in the hope
that people who make that choice will find it rewarding and that we can learn together
even though we may not have an actual conversation and a lot of what's going on here
is one-sided in the sense that the guy who you know has the voice in this relationship for the
moment is me right so you're listening to my voice and hopefully my voice is pleasing and
encouraging and reassuring and you know it'll occasionally veer to other qualities but
but I'm hopeful that together we can forge and enjoy new ground above and beyond what we might
otherwise have access to apart and that's that's mutuality now it's a weird kind of mutuality
in the electronic age where I'm speaking and you're watching right and part of the problem
in our in our modern contexts in many of them anyway is
our common experience and the contexts to which we are exposed and by which we can become compelled
sorry something was checking me out there for a moment a flying insect possibly hymenopteran
these contexts are by and large they are degrading they are stupidifying
we get dumber every time we touch them our relationship with machines is primarily of this
form in case that's not clear I'll just give an example you know if you if you used to ride a horse
you were intimately engaged with a living being who there's probably no reasonable justification
for it to be your slave and just because you're intelligent enough to enslave it doesn't give
you the right to do so but you were on a living being in a living context the horse had senses
about the context that you don't have right and so the horse became a kind of satellite
intelligence that would contribute to your your your sensory relationships with the environments
through which you were passing and much like having a dog cats are a little less common
though some people do take cats for walks
and I have done so myself I've gone on walks with cats many times and enjoyed it immensely
when you have a satellite intelligence with with extra senses
astonishing things happen your sensorium is extended dramatically and to the degree you're
willing to pay attention it can be so dramatic that you might as well comprise a different
species let me give you an example the idea of a single female human being in the wilderness
I'm just picking a female at random and I'm selecting a gender at random from the you know
from the pool I guess moderately we consider it to be a pool rather than a dichotomy in any case
or there's that we again right what what we am I talking about well I'm talking about a kind of
weird public socio-cultural we that actually doesn't really exist and probably hasn't made the
agreements it's supposed to have made and this is part of the point that I'm that I'm heading
toward here uh but let's take a female in the wilderness deep in the wilderness without a
dog and in some other deep wilderness we'll put a dog that's deeply bonded with a female in the
wilderness and what anyone who's paying attention should realize immediately is the female in the
wilderness by herself no matter how adept her senses are she's no match for the the female
with a well bonded canine at her side and there's all kinds of reasons for that not merely scent
which is an extension of taste um which also extends to our skin surfaces by the way as I was
reminded by one of my readers the other day the the female with with the canine might as well be
another species her capacity if again if she's paying attention and cares her capacity to notice
uh situations opportunities threats phenomenon possible relationships in her environment is
so radically extended beyond that of the woman without the dog that she might as well be a
different species now many of us in our minds we have developed things that resemble the relationship
between the female equipped uh excuse me the dog equipped female i'm going to say the female
equipped dog but that works too the dog is absolutely aware that the female has a sensorium
different from its own and one of the places in which they differ is that the female is a
representational cognitive a formally representational cognitive it uses language it has categories
um it has an entirely different way of being in the world than an ordinary animal has now there may
be creatures um we might imagine them to include such creatures as gorillas uh orcas whales dolphins
chimps um prairie dogs another matriarchal society there prairie dogs by the way um and a really
intelligent one there's a great example of a of a mammalian society where the females clearly
have or often at least have a dominant leadership role in the society
um and they use so they use each other's senses right so they magnify information by by group
sensing yeah each unique individual creature contributing to the whole but as i was saying
earlier both the dog and the female who has one or the the dog who has a female however we want to
we want to see that they're going to have opportunities for sensing relation threat
detection you know opportunity understanding discovery um that the the female by herself
will never never have no matter how intelligent she is right they're simply we're simply better
off together um in general now the price there's a little price to pay they need to ensure they
both can eat they're both properly sheltered and they are both relatively you know remain
relatively healthy and this is the place where the female has a weird um advantage over the dog
in the sense that although the dog might be able to kill and bring food to an injured female
a dog cannot set a broken limb but a human can and this is one of the really weird properties
of the animal we are and perhaps of our representational sentience and it's one of the properties
that is extolled in bizarre ways by religion where humans are framed and of course since religion
was written since the books of religions were written primarily by men uh men are extolled as
you know the shepherds of nature now apparently according to the bible this is by divine decree
um i don't have to i'm not required to either entertain or defeat that argument right um i can
do both yeah i can say that whether or not there's any sort of intelligence involved in the origination
of our species and whether there was any intentional involvement of a non-human intelligence in the
origination and and evolutionary distinction of homo sapiens sapiens the only species i know of
that we stuttered on the word wisdom when naming important point um we whether or not there was
there was something that intended to create or embody an animal with the very bizarre unusual
capacities we have i mean if you just look at these animals right they're doing all kinds of
weird things and i'm doing an even weirder thing i'm holding a machine in my hand that was built
by a super organism called a corporation um without which you couldn't build these machines
it's not possible though in modern times because the components are available
it's conceivable that an individual human could build a smartphone
without that being true the chances of something like that happening are extremely slim not impossible
but very very slim and the chances that they could produce something as advanced as advanced as what
i'm holding in my hand which actually is a number of years old um is really really slim negligible
let's call it that so my first point is without losing my train of thought here humans have bizarre
capacities in nature and one there isn't really any other animal that could intentionally in other
words by its intentional sort of non-regularly biological behavior could could draw the entire
history and future of life on earth into crisis but we can do that right and similarly there isn't
to any animal that i know of that can muchly aid another animal who is injured or sick
now that becomes more complex when we include the pharmacopia of nature and we can notice for
example that bees will seek certain mushrooms such as the lion's mane when they're suffering from
varroa and the immune disorders that make them susceptible to that um there is a sort of symbiotic
capacity within relationships to be helpful in cases of harm being you know having been suffered
but there isn't anything like a human being that can set a broken bone of another creature
nurse it back to health um though some mammals can nurse the children of other creatures
and i've seen uh giant crocodiles gently digging out the children of turtles an animal that they
sometimes eat and carrying those babies in her mouth from the sand to the water
now that's altruistic behavior there's no and people generally don't you know they're not likely
anyway unless they're very observant and understand nature more deeply than is common they're not going
to expect crocodiles um to be altruistic and even when they see it you know the the biologists
are likely to explain it away in some bizarre fashion that has nothing to do with altruism because
it's just it's it's counterintuitive to the often flawed way we think about natural relations
relations relations and organismal you know sentience and how reptiles are and things
like this for us to imagine that for example they have feelings
but they do um and that's the problem even insects have feelings they may not have the
luxury of regretting an injury that they suffer but they are aware that they are injured and they
suffer they just don't have the luxury of regret they don't have the luxury of nostalgia perhaps
we might imagine they don't though in more in animals that we call more complex this uh these
capacities may may obtain so humans we have this weird quality which is we are the animal
with the capacity to transform the course of evolution intentionally that's a really bizarre
capability for an animal to have um we are the animal that is aware to some degree of evolution
and that awareness has been very dangerous for us and for life on earth in fact many of the things
our species has become aware of are extremely fucking dangerous for us and everything else
that ever lived and ever will live and why would i say that ever lived right how can we be dangerous
to things that are gone well part of the answer to that and it's not the only answer um what we
know of quantum physics at present which is still to call it early days would be a gross
overstatement what we know of quantum physics tells us that particles that photons that haven't even
been created yet can be entangled with photons in the past and part of what this means is implies
that we have a this is really interesting we have a negligible relationship with the
dimensionality of time we in Edward Abbott's flatland he talks about creatures that live
in a two-dimensional plane and how weird it would be for them how enlightening and shocking and
bizarre even supernatural it would be if creatures that lived in three or four dimensions
were too intrude into their awareness and how for example a sphere passing through their plane
would look at first like a dot that grew to a circle that got to a very wide circle and then
went back to a dot right because as it passes through the plane you're going to see uh cross
sections of the sphere right and they would wonder what the hell is that although to them it would
just look like a dot that extends into a line and then comes back to a dot right because they can't
tell there's a sphere there they can only see lines they live in line land so to speak well in two
dimensions something passing through that plane will will look like a line so we're in this weird
relationship with time where it appears linear to us and it appears mono directionally linear it
only goes forward but it doesn't and um there's another feature of our relationship with the history
and future of life on earth that we tend to overlook which is that
there is a purpose of felt sense to being alive as an organism and and and the luxury with which
that felt sense has richness may depend upon complexity however in organisms like ourselves
which we consider to be singular organisms yet we are not i'm comprised of some 40 trillion cells
half of them bacterial um there's gazillions of viruses inside me um all kinds of you know
all sorts of creatures evolved over time to produce animals like the one that i am um
what we do now changes the meaning of history such that if as citizens of the united states
we do something absolutely horrific then that shadow at least for those people who are alive
now is cast backward over the entire history of our nation right it acquires that flavor if you will
that that scent that stink similarly if we do something so amazing that it ennobles the entire
history of mankind then some of the things we have suffered in history some of the things others have
suffered they won't be justified entirely but they will be
how what is the word that i want here and some of you already know it
if only you were here with my mind helping me to think um
their meaning the meaning of of historical suffering and injustice and tragedy can be
transformed when in modern times we do something so amazing and humane and noble and beautiful and
intelligent that that if our ancestors were present with us they would all breathe a sigh of relief
and say oh it was worth it look at the beautiful things our progeny have done look at this wonderful
thing and it's not just true of humans um all you know animal mothers want something even like
the mothers of rattlesnakes right which which are reptiles that give live birth many people
aren't aware of this um their eggs hatch inside them they give birth to live babies uh they they
they have a natural sense of the desire for their children to succeed and
to prosper in in the in whatever sense it's possible for that kind of organism
and this is natural to all you know all living creatures to to widely varying degrees right
that the complexity adds depth and scope and as we are so complex and so well endowed that we have
conscious minds with which we represent reality and we have language and music and art and
technology and all these things it's particularly true of us right but it's it's true of everything so
it's true of everything so if we really fuck up as a species right now the entire history of
life on earth can be can be injured can be harmed can be lost can be
shown to have been in vain in in a sense right now this is a much more complex idea because it
it supposes that the meanings of ancestral organisms the meanings of their lives are
changed by what happens today and and that's a proposition that i'm going to leave on the table
those of you who wish to contend with it are welcome to do so and i will listen to your
contentions but to me it seems natural that this is so so our species has in fact the bizarre and
fascinating capacity to shepherd although you know that word is is slightly suspect but it
conveys the the gist to shepherd the evolution or dissolution of life on earth right to enhance
and protect the unimaginable endowments with which we have the great fortune to have been
the recipients of or to obliterate them for the the sake of little sheets of paper abstractions
of value the the capacity to build machines or wage war against each other and the environment
and that's the way that things are going at the moment circa you know
june 24th 2020 in general our species is burning down the history and future of life on earth
and it's not necessarily because any specific person wants to it's primarily because our
supercultures are totally unguided by ethos they don't they're not capable of caring right what
what motivates them is profit and power and domination primarily and some people would argue
you that that's a result of patriarchy and i'm going to suggest that the actual roots lie far
deeper than that granting whatever degree of relevancy that idea may have i'm pretty sure
this is a great big quinoa plant but i'm not positive
so the we of our supercultures is largely unguided by morals or ethics it's guided
primarily by this weird kind of darwinian no it's not the right word this weird kind of
pseudo darwinian efficacy problem where the thing that that beats up the other thing's
best wins it's a bully it's a bullying system it's a piracy system and i've discussed this in previous
episodes so i'm not going to go deeply into that here but what i am going to
suggest and i still want to return to um the topic of study but what i'm going to suggest is that
it's unfortunate that that
our supercultures have this tendency to take on the shadows of what we understand about
competition and what we understand about evolution i'm going to proclaim is wildly primitive this
idea has only been around for maybe you know 100 years or something and our species knows very
little about it and the ideas we have are largely the result of the perspectives we've taken
and the perspectives we've taken have led us toward mechanism and in a sort of mechanistic
battle for supremacy you know fitness right the the fitness of the of the organism is the defining
factor in survival propagation development and so on and environments affect that developmental
process that developmental timeline in various ways organisms can adapt
or they can also reach sort of homeostasis with environments so that for example fruit flies
subjected to various kinds of environmental change can adapt very quickly because their
their generational cycles are very fast yeah a day or a few days or something like this
elephants don't adapt as quickly because they live a long time and so like us
are subject to various problems such as cancer that generally require a relatively old organism
to study now here's where i want there's a couple of things i i want to put on the table
so first of all whether or not it was divinely decreed our species is effectively the steward
of life on earth and the reason that we are is because we have the capacity to either obliterate
it or preserve it now how could we preserve it well there's lots of ways we could part of that
would be like just not obliterating it right but we have the potential to avert things like
an asteroid strike that would wipe out all of the remaining anciently conserved organisms
and ecologies of any significant complexity and some will argue well that's just a natural process
it happens from time to time yeah go ahead and argue that and surely if you're not if you feel
in no way connected to the the biome right and you don't feel like like it's ancestors or your
ancestors and its body is your body then it all becomes an abstract question you can just say
yeah you know the whole thing gets wiped out every once in a while it's no big deal but that's a
disembodied and kind of psychotic or even schizophrenic perspective and unfortunately
that's the kind of perspective our supercultures and our corporations largely have right they just
they're going to do as much damage as they possibly can get away with and maybe more because
they're not intelligent enough to know when they've done enough damage that the whole damn thing
falls down and we're in very great danger of that now so like it or not whether it's a divine
decree or an accident of evolutionary um novelty our species is the steward of life on earth it's a
fact and we should be aware in the same way that when someone's driving a car they have to be aware
right of that fact so they can't just go around crashing it into things and making up stories
about why that's okay which is something that our supercultures and corporations absolutely do in
fact we don't even need supercultures our president is doing this kind of thing all day long right we
don't need nature we can frack and put oil wells and wipe out ecologies and destroy the
environmental protection agency which wasn't exactly doing the greatest job anyway um but at
least there was some kind of buffer between corporate greed and the the delicate remaining
ecologies that depend on us to not destroy them let alone for protection uh all right so there's
two directions i still want to go on the first is that for me study tends to mean it has the sort
of Hippocratic oath to it first do no harm right and that's a very noble motivation that's a very
noble principle first don't make it worse right now unfortunately we're not really intelligent or
aware enough generally as individuals or as a species to be able to fully live up to that ideal
however much we may take its heart and in fact in my own life i am only modestly good at living up
to that ideal and yet i hold it in great reverence right so there's this really weird problem with
what we call science where researchers around the world apparently believe that it's perfectly
reasonable to torture or obliterate organisms to imprison them and subject them to all kinds of
bizarre environmental stress and psychological stress and physical agony and so on and so forth
in order to gather information and that seems to me to be ethically reprehensible
i have never agreed with that even when i was a child and i began to i had a microscope as a child
and i i used to watch microorganisms i was aware as i was observing them on you know on a slide with
with a slip cover under the harsh light produced by the little bulb that creates the transmissive
medium that enables microscopy at that you know at that level that those creatures were dying
so that i could observe them and i have to tell you that some can you know feel free to accuse me
of ignorance or you know anthropomorphism or whatever you want whatever accusations feel
appropriate um some people could say well they're just microorganisms they don't they don't feel pain
and yet microorganisms are both philic and phobic which means they avoid some sensations
i think there's a pipe vine swallowtail and they seek other sensations and that means
that whether or not they can feel the thing that we specifically refer to as pain they know
the physical experience of discomfort and i felt great guilt that in order and i still do to this
day if i if i use my microscope i try to return the organisms to the environment i retrieved them
from without killing them and people will say like oh you know you're you're a man who
shoots horses and saves gnats right and i might have to agree for i am an omnivore i eat meat
and people can say well like if you know there's a conflict there there's hypocrisy there let me
explain something about being human to these people to everyone and again you know i'm i'm
open to correction i don't believe that i understand i'm trying to understand
to be human is to be conflicted fundamentally our hemispheres are are absolutely not absolutely
there they're intimately conflicting aspects intimately conflicting ways of being in consciousness
in the body in the world it doesn't mean they have nothing in common it means they have
lots of conflicting stuff that stands between them and this is part of why we have the story
in the bible of cain and abel this is part of why iain migilchrist wrote the incredible book
i'm so grateful that he wrote the master and his emissary the divided brain and the making of
western civilization if i've got the subtitle right um to be human is to be conflicted we're
going to experience conflict and some of it's going to be subtly hypocritical and some of it's
going to be catastrophically hypocritical none of us are perfect and yet we can learn to follow
the inspirations and senses and feelings and observations that we find most noble
toward higher ground toward uh developmental efflorescence right toward understanding toward
insight toward intelligence toward compassion toward prodigy and this i say is our imperative
and so with this in mind i can at the same time declare i eat meat and i rescue insects from my
home take them outside even mosquitoes which i used to obliterate with relish long time ago and i
don't mean the condiment um so for me study implies intimate relation with it implies a bonding
like that of the female that i the the um theoretical female with her dog in the in the
wilderness um it implies a unification of pasts presence and possible futures and therefore
i do not want to kill to study and i'm highly suspicious of any knowledge discipline that is
completely willing to do so with wild abandon the way modern and relatively recent historical
research quote unquote um appears to be inclined now that isn't to say that all researchers that
way there are people um like jane goodall and diane fossey who let's face it they probably um
it'd be hard to say they brought no misfortune on the subjects of their study
but this these uh amazing women who are role models for me like jacuzzo and um the guy who
runs uh the sea shepherd conservation society and other great naturalists um they were reaching
out a symbiotic hand toward the life forms they studied and that to me is beautiful um that to
me is noble uh but the idea that um in search of information were completely entitled to torture
or obliterate uh the organisms whose secrets we wish to rest from their biology is insane and
deadly it's just wrong and part of why it's wrong is that from my perspective life on earth
forms a unity and it's not just a unity with terrestrial life it's a unity with all of life
and all of time and space so we can't do harm you know my pinky shouldn't attack my hand my hand
shouldn't attack my arm my arm shouldn't attack my body and my body shouldn't attack my mind you
know especially for purposes of trying to rest information from my own biology uh now some could
argue well i mean there's lots of arguments against this right like where would biology be if we didn't
do dissection you know what would we know would we even know about the existence of cells um
how would we be able to uh have health care if we couldn't draw blood samples yes these are extreme
possibilities for you know disagreement and i'm not an absolutist what i'm saying is as a guideline
right we should be aware we should have reverence for the ecologies and living beings and for the
ancestral beings whose progeny they are and for the beings of the future who are the ancestors of
ourselves and life on earth and with that reverence we may occasionally make decisions
that are inelegant and perhaps even ignoble um out of some felt sense of necessity
but we should be guided by the sense that what we harm without will be harmed within
and thus guided i think we're less likely to make the kinds of catastrophic mistakes
that are relatively common in the research activities of our superculture the organs
of our superculture right academia and corporate science and so on and so forth
but we have this other problem it's a we i keep i keep this word we keeps dragging me
like a black hole back to my desire to disambiguate it and continually remind us all that there is no
we until we make an agreement form one and the victim we or the arbitrary collective we we americans
right or we poor people right um those are both examples those are figures of speech
they're not actual we's like they can't guide themselves or correct themselves they don't
tend to learn um they're not likely to forge intelligent agreements or anything like that and
if a group of people believes they they form a we like we the american people then they will be
confused when that we fails to act intelligently on matters of great import but there is no we
americans what we have is an ever more fragmented uh library of factions often conflicting over
minutiae or nonsense or even just things that would need an upgrade to be thought of as nonsense
so that whole idea of we is wrong and part of the reason that we're
that us humans us modern humans are facing so many problems is because we suppose that
there is a we that is intelligently acting and thinking and making decisions when that's not
even vaguely the case and in fact if anything is the case it's that the opposite is true there's
an anti we there's a non us and that non us is often composed of the disembodied meaning they
don't have bodies right organs of corporations supercultures and we groups that hide like the
builder bergs and the trilateral commission and and the elite wealthy of the world that are primarily
farming everything else so that in a single lifetime they can accrue more wealth than was
possible for any for like the entire history of mankind a thousand years ago yeah um so this
kind of nonsense has been going on for quite some time now but it's become particularly virulent
and common in our time um there's a there's a there's a hidden we in the background sort of
puppeteering the rest of of of mankind in the world and this is part of why us modern people
are subject to conspiracy theories because we sense that something has gone fundamentally wrong
that the the motivations and activities of the corporations and supercultures have become
lethally toxic and rapacious and vicious not that they ever really weren't
but now you know the history and future of life on earth hangs in the balance
and if a move is not made to intervene very very quickly
we're going to become sorry about the wind here
the instigators and inheritors of a cascade of catastrophes unlike anything ever seen
in the history of life on earth or mankind so us modern humans trying to avoid saying we
in a sneaky way have to forge intelligent collectives we have to learn how to do this
we need to do it yesterday we need to do it 20 years ago 50 years ago but we absolutely have to do it
tomorrow and if we don't then the history and future of mankind and all of life is very likely
to be sacrificed on the altar of the bizarre mechanically rapacious ravages of modern commercial
superculture the prison the prison military industrial complex so on and so forth and in
fact some of what underlies this is nothing more sophisticated than the language that we use right
it's this we in our language that's so deceptive and we believe us modern humans are inclined to
believe that science is relatively noble and it's not unless we are noble with what we do with science
science is not intrinsically noble there's nothing intrinsically noble about it there's this idea
that well it lifted us up from superstition yes well it also lifted us up from intimate
relationships with the environments with which and for which and of which you know we arise
so you know the idea that science like rebonds us to the earth is insane i mean it's not that it
couldn't but it doesn't i notice suddenly as i pause that i've been doing this this slightly
italian thing and i i am slightly italian of ranting which i got in trouble for the other day
a close friend who's who i've been friends with for many years and uh who i love a lot
he's kind of a crazy guy but he's very smart um and he likes to rant too uh he took offense at one
of my rants and sort of cut me off and perhaps he and i will not speak again though i hope that's not
the case um but my rant was relatively innocent and fairly short lived and he should have at least
asked me a question or interrupted me and just said hey what's going on over there right as any
friendly person might so we have this other problem which is that simulations of intelligence aren't
intelligent simulations of symbiosis aren't symbiotic um simulations of learning don't learn
right and the problem that i'm going to point out here is that
there's a disease rampant in our modern human social contexts and it's the disease of news
it's an informational disease and if you imagine that all of the human minds on earth comprise a
network and that network comprises something analogous to an ecology and that in that ecology
there are transports between groups and individuals which of course all of these things are reasonably
easy to suppose at least for the sake of a model so i'm going to call the network the cognizium
and i'm going to call the transports the mimula and that includes things that are visible and
invisible right things that are tangible and intangible the internet is probably the most
significant physical layer of a manipulable a human manipulable aspect of the mimula but
there are many other layers and some of them are probably if they're not so weird as to qualify
a supernatural a word that i like to um avoid because i think that everything that's in nature
is natural there's just there but there is spooky stuff that's natural um there are layers
that are non-ordinary that's a word i prefer there are layers to the mimula that are non-ordinary
and i strongly suspect that the idea of angels and demons is related to the human mimula
and what motivates it and shapes it and instructs its development or devolution
um complex topic that i'm not going to go into today but in the mimula in this model
there exists something that i refer to as thrips and these are not merely memes
they are the analog of warlike organisms that compete for dominance of the terrain of human
consciousness and they have intention they intend to dominate the the cognizium and they intend to
dominate the mimula and what they compete for is dominance dominance of transports within the
mimula dominance of specific humans and groups which they see as reproductive organs um
and the process is quite terrifying if one were to have a direct way of looking at it from above
rather than looking at it through it which is sort of how we are in this sense we live in flatland
right we can't see the cognizium and the mimula and the thrips from above we actually use
the cognizium and the mimula and thrips to see with
and once converted by various thrips we become their agents and thus we view others who do not
carry the same and and promote the same thrips that have dominated us we view them as other
and we are inclined to attack them now this is just a model it's a toy it's something we can
use i'm not saying this is how it is i'm saying this is what it's like right i'm saying this
likeness is very powerful to use to see into processes and situations that are otherwise
invisible to us and very difficult for us to contact and unfortunately what's going on now is
there's a rapid i'm not going to use the word evolutionary i think i think people wrongly equate
evolution with development evolution isn't development evolution is modulation toward
fitness with contexts very very important distinction if you just learn that one thing
we will have succeeded wildly today and part of that means that if you're in a really crappy
low-grade context and you evolve for fitness in that context that doesn't mean you're really
necessarily have succeeded or even developed it just means you've acquired fitness with a context
that's toxic or degrading or you know ignoble dehumanizing right um and most of the contexts produced
and promulgated by our supercultures are of this kind they are degrading they are inhuman
with some few exceptions
so what's been going on lately is there's been this rapid upsurge in extremely toxic virulent
weaponized i can't not call it information but usually when i use the word information i mean
something that's relatively veritable right something what's actually related to the subjects
from which and and the purpose is for which we derive it and information is such a general term
that it may be the wrong one to use i may need to sharpen my vocabulary here but for the moment
i'm going to stick with it we are um due to the current economic and epidemiological and socio
political environment us modern humans that's what i mean by we but i might also mean particular
groups of us um certainly i belong to a privileged group there's no doubt of that um and there are
a number of different ways to frame my privilege but one of them is just the fact that i'm i'm able
to do what i'm doing right now i have the leisure and the technology to record this video and i have
the intellectual luxury of having developed a mind rich and sophisticated and curious and
passionate enough to endow me with this capacity for something resembling flight
um i can often fly far above the contexts in which i might otherwise be
stuck and enmeshed and degraded and and tortured and it isn't that i haven't suffered i have um
it's just that the portion of suffering that has accrued to me is minimal enough that it didn't
yet it hasn't yet silenced me yeah so i i have the privilege of of being able to have
this opportunity to opine on matters that i that are near and dear to my heart and my concern
and primarily my concern is not for myself although i'm self-concerned enough that i wish
to survive in in relative comfort and so on um it is for life on earth and for the children
of mankind um my hope is to lessen their suffering and give them perspectives that will allow them
to develop in ways that the contexts in which they will ordinarily find themselves would not only
prohibit but might punish so so we're in the situation now where we're seeing a degree of
informational warfare in you know using the electronic mimula particularly um or the electronic
layer of the mimula in a in a in an effort to convert large populations that comprise the
human cognizium into weapons and the primary purpose for that is domination subjugation
and getting essentially people to attack each other and the reason why that's useful
is that the disembodied sort of psychotic supercultures described by iain migilchrist
in the master and his emissary and first hinted at by ancient stories like cain and abel
where cain kills his brother berries him then lies to god about having done so
by the way that cain guy that's the father of the supercultures that
that the disembodied supercultures right the sort of one way of thinking about them is um
the uncorrected over inflated left hemispheric aspects of our humanity right when i say left
hemispheric i mean the left hemisphere of our corpus callosum which has developed this incredible
capacity for representational thought abstraction um science technology and our supercultures
are the shadow of that right there's nothing that corrects them there's no right hemisphere
that's embodied that comes along and goes like hey don't burn down the fucking amazon rainforests
don't rip the oceans themselves to shreds your hubris will kill everything if you do this there's
no they're not correctable we never established anything human or intelligent enough or um
empowered enough to have much of an effect at all on corporations and and the activities of
supercultures yet and this i say we must do if we hope to survive in any meaningfully human
form in a world that's worth living in this thing here that i'm i'm enmeshed in right now
huh this is a real cognizium the human cognizium has been taken over by its own projections right
but this stuff around me this grass and you can say well the humans brought this guy you can say
whatever you want this stuff is so old that the idea of time is ridiculous in comparison to it
because it partakes of modes of time we have been too fucking timid to imagine let alone contact
and so this i feel like i'm in paradise right now there are still trees and animals and insects
here not as many as there should be but some i live in a time where i can still walk outside
without a gas mask and an oxygen tank and you know this is an unimaginable privilege to be alive in
this moment and it's also a privilege to be alive in this moment because of the crises we're facing
this is the time when a single beautiful gesture might mean more than it ever did in history
so if we can manage to do something amazing together now we will have succeeded at a task
so astonishing and beautiful that we will ennoble the entire history of life on earth and this is
my hope and my dream but at the moment the dark forces have have surged to incredible primacy
now it may be that their own hubris will be their undoing i just don't want them to take
the entire biosphere and the history and future of life on on earth and mankind with them and so
it is for this reason that i i make these little these little videos and conversations in the hope of
it in the hope of providing perspectives awareness and understanding about features of our situation
that will give us the opportunity to overcome it rather than to remain as we have for so long
almost entirely subject to it and if you share that vision then we are in agreement
and that's a we i trust and value respect and have reverence for thank you for joining me bye bye for now
