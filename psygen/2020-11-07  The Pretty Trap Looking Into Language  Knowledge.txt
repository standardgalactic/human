Hi everybody.
I often spend time talking about language and some of the peculiar features which I
think underneath them if we want to use this lens because it can be useful to do so, if
we look at a kind of a there's a set theoretic aspect to language yet even in the written
form I don't think it's set theoretic to the degree that set theory encompasses the
essence and opportunities and nature of language and language and knowledge are relative now of
course it can be useful if I were lecturing rather than sort of exploring I might try to offer
context local definitions for what I mean by language and what I mean by knowledge and that's
useful because as broad generalizations they're incredibly vague in fact they're vague enough
that whatever meaning might attach to them in our you know thought in our imagination
is almost arbitrary it's kind of throwing a penny in a pond
but I'm not lecturing I'm just exploring so by language gosh how am I gonna define this
I've set myself a pretty trap here so maybe I'll just say that I'm using the terms rather
casually for the moment so that they refer to what they ordinarily refer this doesn't resolve
the problem I previously framed it decides to be at ease with it for the moment I think I
try to reflect deeply on problems related to not just the nature of knowledge but
the seemingly endless peculiar forms of you know distinguishable kinds if you will of knowledge
and I think generally the conceptual kind and also to some degree perhaps not completely the
rational kind of knowledge and not merely knowledge but behaviors around because the knowledge doesn't
exist abstractly from the humans even if there are eternal forms or something right it's still
for us humans knowledge will refer to things humans can know right or have experienced knowing
and some of that axiomatic right we will claim to know something because we laid down axioms
under which we decided knowledge was possible and then having accomplished such provisions
we declare the result in consciousness or awareness memory language so on knowledge
and as I mentioned before it's not my intention to survey or inventory the kinds of knowledge
the different modes of knowing you know we can see in our in our culture different ways of knowing
for example this is a useful side branch but science or scientific endeavor more appropriately is a way
of knowing artistic endeavor is a way of knowing literate endeavors academic endeavors in general
these explore specific branches of ways of knowing according to the contexts that they've
acquired you know the structural persona of over time engineering is a way of knowing mathematics
is a way of knowing physical embodiment nonverbally just the felt sense of being an organism and a
human organism a way of knowing dreaming somehow I think a way of knowing with a with an important
asterisk next to it though that asked asterisk can transform in many ways and all these ways
of knowing can be thought of as unique transformations of imaginal assets
and I think even without imagination our memory might be useless imagination is another one of
these general terms that is very confusing because it's quite challenging and I think we
should pause for a moment with wonder and awe and maybe even reverence to try to think about
what it is that is being pointed at when we use this word imagine to imagine or imagination and
again there's there's for a jungle of different modes or kinds we can distinguish yet the general
term is not entirely without meaning right it's still meaningful even though we can also say
what what does my imagination mean but in some sense for me it is the strange and actually
mysterious inner theater in awareness oh my goodness yeah the problem for me is I have wonder
and reverence and awe for this thing and I don't I'm disinclined to try to frame it in language
in general because of this
it's sort of the heart or inhabited living space of the mind and yet you know we can't
really entirely disentangle it from memory it responds to our intention yet most of us
cannot merely command it with our intention unlike for example my hand it partakes of
capacities familiar from dreaming and yet what we mean when we say imagine in English
this word has the connotations the verb of making pictures of generating scenes or images
yet there's something truly mysterious and astonishing here if we take this faculty we
don't even have to take it away if we just modulate it slightly in one direction in humans
none of our like a completely different set of developmental timelines right would have
ensued like you could probably turn off human intelligence just by slightly messing with
imagination not that that's how I ordinarily think of it in fact that that idea never occurred to
me before just now and of course our environments do radically impose extremely narrow
contexting structures right into which we are in in danger of collapsing over time
conceptual knowledge troubles me for simple reasons it easily acquires the appearance
of conclusivity right this is so and once that selection once that particular
once we select that destination right in traveling in consciousness or awareness or thought
however self-satisfying it might immediately seem and that's one of the really dangerous aspects
of knowledge the sort of intuited the stealth attachment of knowledge is blindness and there
are varieties of knowledge that are resistant to this but they I think they tend to and I
try to practice something along these lines they tend to keep a big space open for incompleteness
right they realize like okay we've got a couple of views on a tiny little fraction of a phenomenon
we don't know the antecedents right we don't know what is actually going on but we've got this
little grasp on on a range of metric you know stuff we can make metrics about and measure and
very useful but it the fact even that we have theories that are highly correct and relativity
is impressively correct about computations regarding the topics it covers the reference
frame is missing with all of in this sense knowledge is fundamentally provisional for
really peculiar reason we don't know the first thing and that that seemingly modest tiny little
insight stateable in a sentence a child could understand and yet overlook it's really easy to
hear such simple words and then you know just dismiss it and of course it's my responsibility to
keep it interesting enough that you can't but not your worst necessarily although you've got a
role in it we don't understand the reference frame we engineered frameworks that we could use and
sort of fill in right and test and we engineered them from perspectives familiar to us and novel
yet not so novel as to be unintelligible and that's a crude way of describing the process but what
I'm trying to say is that the knowledge landscape includes both insights and occlusions that have
long that are like traditionally believed and we're all kind of intuitively aware of this this in no
way invalidates valid scientific work or findings quite the opposite it's just it sets them in a
more trustworthy context the sciences process and as it proceeds it tries to divest itself of myths
so to speak and advance beyond previous you know reference frames so we went from like we added
you know dimensionality in all kinds of things though it wasn't we precisely that did this these
things in the development of our physical sciences there were sort of evolutionary landmarks right
that could very crudely be you know painted as like Newton's relativity quantum mechanics
and you can see the radical transformation of knowledge over time and extremely counterintuitive
ideas were introduced to the point to the degree that there was kind of a crisis in in the human
knowledge landscape in two ways that are really interesting both of them are interesting to me
we failed to transfer fundamental insights about time and identity and locale and context
from Einstein and relativity from Einstein into ordinary thought about identity and categories and
because relativity should have revised our relationship with the cat with the way we
understand what the categories refer to even the categories we already have not to mention
we might have invented some new ones right that were the result of the insights
incumbent from relativity and this largely never happened so linguistically
one might say that we have a kind of a problem of a high bound traditionalism
in thought and knowledge about identity in relation we still tend to think in and our categories
have the character of Newtonian physics or even you know before that right
so that stuff kind of never got updated and there's a fascinating there's another universe
here going on that's invisible to us because of what's occluded right by
not so much exactly by our language but by the way our understandings of the meanings of categories
and their members
are too narrow they've lost dimensionality over the development of more structured human consciousness
they've lost degrees of liberty they've lost depth and richness they've become very sort of declarative
conceptual o trees or you know plants plants or things living things or you know whatever
non-sentient you can just chop them up and do whatever you want with them and animals are
pretty much the same thing but a little more you know this kind of stuff
there's a there's a reductionist inclination right in
in not not just the knowledge landscape
but the dominant elements or terrains or manifolds within the knowledge landscape
and all of this knowledge is provisional it's as if uh
it's as if our species
if you can imagine a human child
that was raised by humans enough to gain language
but really had no one to talk to and no one to ask questions of
right
got to tie my shoe one moment
so in a way
so
one could imagine our species as an intelligent
i sometimes like to imagine it this way maybe i should be more general
it was as if we didn't have parents right our intelligence was born
i don't actually think this way but you can imagine a science fiction story where
and and of course this has been done um david brinn for example uh has this concept of uplift
where intelligent species have an uplift parent right another intelligent species sort of
carries them far enough up the ladder that they then will proceed you know someone on their own
and it's as if our species in our childlike astonishing potential
maybe had some kind of access to another intelligence and i can point at some pretty
obvious places where it might be found like nature for example older stuff right living
stuff that's older than us um that that's part of the super organism that we are an expression
of right that's where one place where you could look but there might have been more places
places in any case over time and i think you know when you're with
that's funny i don't know if i can say that
over time the richness of
the imaginal
waters from which language emerged and for which language emerged that richness
lost dimensionality maybe it became you know we could imagine became very salty or something but
the original richness and diversity of association and connotation meaningful
not abstract not arbitrary
in our distant ancestors we must i must anyway imagine radically
uh you know it makes us look
well many of our words lack fundamentally meaningful connotations in the first place
and they acquire abstract associations and connotations as well as personal ones throughout
our lives but probably most profusely during certain times in our childhood and maybe teenage years
some of that that vitality that learning motivation continues on into adulthood at least for some of us
to some degree in some forms
you know i was listening to a podcast and someone made a comment that i think was popular or
um probably made by famous scientists or or is um associated with them and it was something like
i'll probably paraphrase it uh
my understandings are evidence-based
and here we see the collision right in a statement like this
of an underlying assumption of conceptual knowledge that is fundamentally dangerous it's
like a broken mine shaft actually that's been covered over right you're walking through a field
i've been in a field like this at random places throughout the field
there's old degraded plywood covered up with dirt and grass and junk and if you step on that stuff
it just shatters and drops you into you know a 300 foot vertical mine shaft
and there's places like this in human cognition and this is why i'm concerned actually
and we fall into them all the time but we don't have eyes there so we mostly can't tell you know
and sometimes we just stay trapped down in the bottom for the rest of our lives
so
hmm it's funny how thread memory works it's very easy to lose a thread if i shift for example
towards seeing humor in what i'm talking about right my my focused mind it plays with a certain
kind of structure and the humorous mind the kind of structure it makes in imagination is very different
so i've momentarily lost my thread
something very dangerous about cognition and conceptual cognition
i'll have to i'll have to hope it'll return to me and proceed now i'll make a new path i guess
so
us moderns we grew up not knowing the first thing and um most of us had to kind of get
off the shelf versions of the first thing and what the first thing is sort of although ours are pretty
wonky um it's uh what we might call i refer to it as the uniform and what the everything is or
one's worldview right it's the first thing is essentially you know what's going on here
and human knowledge about that particularly if you just like generalize over the landscape
rather than looking at specific um mountains or valleys in that landscape which is also useful
um it's incredibly provisional it looks like children's toys about something
that really the first thing is not and nobody's got any much of a you know hold on it um
oh right evidence led yeah my understanding is the result of evidence yeah here's the problem
with that this is where two things collide and one of them is language
and the other is knowledge but underneath both of those or but or you know around them
have everyone to think about it above them there's um
there's a mostly inaccessible there's a partly accessible dimension of pre-structured potential
like it's not fully structured but it acquires structure over time and begins to collapse toward
form and everything that i mean that's a wonderful toy about just about everything
and that pre-structured place is very interesting but the problem with
um evidence leads my understanding and i wish i had the exact quote because it was
it sounded relatively absolute which would be even more dangerous
the problem here is that there's a there's a super frame right there's a the next frame up
from this this form of thinking is what is thinking this what am i thinking this with and for
and that frame is very peculiar and i think suspicious um
intrinsic to this declaration and here's the covered my this is the covered mine shaft
is that evidence interprets itself right evidence tells us what is true not so
there's no place that's so
and so if we are to think about this more meaningfully more intelligently in a way that
will return degrees of liberty we will realize that evidence plus uh you know human mind and
imagination right and that's got features like motive right purpose why i'm here doing this in
the first place um history memory imagination this comes to life in imagination before it can be any
part of our conscious experience just as my own talk is happening now right it's very strange
process when i think about it there is an invisible turmoil living storm inside my mind
and it's making these sort of little lightning things it's just one way of imaging it
but yeah it's making these little lightning things that eventually collapse down into
structures of related ideas and you know i can make face noises and move my hands around and
stuff and have fun and smile and and be in the garden it's good
our knowledge is provisional but it's very easy to fall into a kind of trance where even
the simplest declarations declarations that taken seriously would be seen to be impossible
it cannot be true um we take them not only as facts but as arbiters of identity
i mean if a bird tried it if a mind is like a wing and a bird tried to do that with a wing
it would be an ugly terrifying thing to be hold
the bird would be should attacking itself with its wing and doing every other thing but flying
or even being able to walk um yeah but we humans have fallen into this sad i think
and mostly unconscious relationship with language and knowledge
and so with understanding because though there are non-verbal kinds of understanding i would
say or at least i would use the word that way occasionally um
the understanding that happens particularly when we use language together or are involved in
languaging behavior together that's a very peculiar thing that's a truly remarkable thing
i mean there's lots of features of humans that are quite remarkable if you compare them to the
face of nature i find it very difficult though it might be healthy for me to do so not to see us as
a human being
profoundly privileged
to have um the lifespan that we have hands hands i mean wings are fabulous fins brilliant
pseudopods tentacles off the charts amazing but these things are really really weird
in what they portend for the development of an animal you know having an appendage like this
right i started to say equipped with because this is you know common thing to say in english
but there's a mechanical connotation there that i don't it doesn't resonate for me in fact
uh
i don't i'm very nervous about mechanical associations because the humans appear to
be confused about what constitutes life or even mechanism
so
you know i was thinking the other night because there's this trope
where someone asks me you know what do you know about this and so i said i don't know the first
thing about it and i suddenly realized
though maybe i've got a little exception here
as a regular modern human being we don't know the first thing about anything at all
so there's still some way to make some kind of progress or something resembling progress
according to our definition of progress um to see better to understand more deeply
to have more degrees of liberty in thought and relation opportunity problem solving
to progress
the problems exist in every language but i think there were old languages that were so well aware
of this that they really managed to conserve aspects of richness and dimensionality and
connotation and association that inclined them to understand more subtle aspects of conceptual
imagining and thought and of naming um
they were aware that somehow that with language they were playing with something
so
at least half mysterious like half secret and probably really half divine like from the
universe of partly from the universe of origin you know it's a very
unpredictably powerful new way of being in mind and of behaving and seeing and thinking
now of course we would think that language doesn't affect what we physically see
but that's a tenuous assertion even though it seems superficially true
the first thing
so if the first thing is missing or if we take a kind of a doll of it that's maybe partly deformed
and put it there because we don't have something from
another intelligence that we trust that could guide us and say okay well we can't tell you what the
first thing is but look in this direction and it will become apparent or something like this right
at least you can see how the entire tree of human knowledge is founded on a question mark
it doesn't mean there's nothing trustworthy in there it means nobody knows the first thing about
things and language presents the opposite appearance that not only has the first thing
been known the other important things have already been taken care these are pre-digested for you
and a token is spit out you know tree bird money right some token spit out
and that's all you need right now you're good to go go where for for what the world has been
unconscious thought in some way not in everyone some people still feel the strange living
dimensionality of actual being to some degree and some people are having delusions and some
are hallucinating and whatever too right like it's all going on everything you know that we
know about being human all day every day billions of us
but the ideas of identity the foundational ideas
is
on which our understanding of what is possible
are based these things over time have shriveled into tiny little very narrow
just like the conceptual skeleton with no content much associated with it anymore
and I'll just to be really to be a little bit daring
is clear to me
from what I've been able to learn and also from direct experience
that the living beings
are something that if we got an even slightly more a slightly clearer and deeper glimpse of
it would destroy all of our categories it would show them all to have been crippling
misconceptions nearly all of them
and so weirdly our relationship with knowledge and language I'm not concerned so much obviously
about where it gives us insight and it does and I'm very happy about that right I'm fascinated by
memory and language and knowledge and intelligence and questions and you know chasing them so on
like a dog chasing cats but I go after questions
hopefully I'm not making too much noise and the questions don't usually go up trees but
sometimes they do actually now that I think of it
we've been transmitting to our children a broken lexicon of categories
and the associations appropriate to the root elements of the tree of categories from which
we derive conceptual and linguistic identity and those two things link together they affect
each other deeply and language does not determine knowledge nor does it determine what is seen
but it profoundly influences it particularly in terms of what is seen in in and or with language
but I think even beyond that
so one of my senses is that
there's a better way to make the evidence statement because evidence determines my understanding is
woefully confused data has to be interpreted it's frame it's pre-framed purpose you know
purposeively purposeively it's purposeively reframe
the motive right is goes into the interpretations
and data is also incomplete and partial and collecting data about something probably changes
the something you're collecting data about it probably changes you
right
we can't there's no there's no way to be in research without affecting that which is researched
and being affected by doing research right because that frame
it's purposes and conserved starting perspectives
are selective and and utilitarian and by selective I mean they're carefully selected
tools of thought right established traditions of evaluations statistics p-values and so on
I pay attention to evidence
and well evidenced arguments may are likely to influence me
yet I'm also aware that we don't know the first thing and so in a way knowledge is
provisional that doesn't necessarily lead me to oppose
I'm certainly not in I'm in no way in opposition to
the rational inclusion and interpretation of evidence about you know some claim
but I'm also aware that we're sort of stumbling around in the dark and we often get things
actually backwards like 180 degrees wrong quite frequently and over time you know maybe
sometimes we discover this in in particular areas of research I was thinking of an example
from biology and we also overlook stuff our science you know it's not
let's say that its coverage is wildly incomplete
we're very curious about specific phenomenon we've got some modest early days coverage of
that stuff I mean it looks very good to us because it's gives us the capacity to physically manipulate
forces and constituents of matter and things like this and that so that looks really you know
powerful but we still don't know what the first thing is so we don't know what we're manipulating
and if you don't know what you're manipulating
it's reasonable to have some concern about the other parts of your knowledge
right about its peculiar provisionality it's not as firmly established as language presents it
and nor can language encompass
the actual depth of phenomenal experience as an organism
there won't be a single description
and metaphors are often far more enlightening than declarations
of course there I made a declaration rather than a metaphor
and you know there's a problem here about belief
right because belief is a really weird aspect of relation with knowledge
um
I might be inclined to believe one of my ideas or thoughts or models to some degree
right I find such a thing useful or valid or beautiful
or capable of giving me perspectives otherwise very difficult for me to to have to experience
but that doesn't mean I take it as factual
I'm inclined not to believe it much because
it's my experience that whatever it is that might be going on with me and you and the universe and
time space and all these things it's deeply profoundly different from the world of language and concepts
and I suspect that even its relationship with mathematics is much
stranger than anything we'd be likely to imagine
so for me there's like there's fundamental inclusion
of this sort of mysterious incompleteness
that is accessible to us because we're an expression of this moment to moment right
our minds our imaginations and so on these are
I won't say they're properties of this living mysterious pre-forming
potential but they're children of it it seems or I like to think this way now do I believe that
well I'm inclined I like the idea and it's useful to me in various ways
I certainly don't believe that it encompasses and it could even be largely wrong the other kind
of weird thing about knowledge is learning is such a strange process and a process that
I think often requires as if like being in the world as if I am a musician or an elf or a whale
or a tree or a soul so there's this aspect of our learning that requires as if
imaginal play right not entirely dissimilar from what went on as children
and the contexts that we're in they're not very friendly to that to put it mildly
I always mostly disregarded that unfriendliness
but that can be very dangerous it can get one in trouble
I think my point was
sometimes like the path to an insight of some kind right to awakening to sudden understanding
deeper understanding
it often the ladder that gets us there contained wildly wrong things
like stuff that was just like nope now I'm not necessarily I'm not claiming those were necessary
but it turns out that often in most cases like we were standing I had to stand on some idea or
belief for many years that was completely fallacious or you know at least pretty you know
highly questionable put it that way and you know from there I would move to a position
where I could see better and understand more deeply or more broadly or more usefully
so the weird thing is that we don't just go from you know
rung one to rung 970 although we can make leaps
I think it's just really important to have the freedom to get it wrong on the way to make getting it better
and this can be troubling because there are there are things that are really relatively
simple to do the first time you try them even though there's nuance you can acquire over time
there are other things that are essentially almost impossible to do the first time you try them
and they don't even seem like things that one that can be done after trying them I know because
I've tried some of these so there's a weird barrier of
kind of tension in the beginning of the process where one's pushing against the possibility of
acquiring skill and just failing failing failing and there's a few branches of human activity where
this is turns out to be really important this failing I'll I'll leave them as mysteries for
listener to to consider
it would be very uncouth of me to say in delicate and irreverent to say what the first thing is
though I have some
I have some peculiar relationship with this problem personally
but I might say that there's something about
transformations
of potential and opportunity
as something transcendentally unified which is a very difficult thing to explain
because it's not simple it's just one thing but there's if there's a transcendental unity
this can be enriched by
unity in distinction like we have sort of in the physical
universe and even if there's no transcendental unity like if that did not proceed life on earth
around here
it seems the natural outcome
of the existence of our ecologies
and what they actually are expressions of as opposed to our very limited modern
again some ways our modern stories are so limiting that you'd be better off with a fairy tale
right because at least a fairy tale has mystery associated with it fundamentally
right and removing that is a very cruel amputation
and unjustifiable there's no you can remove it momentarily for clinical
stuff right for academic stuff but you better you better like put it back in at some point
and say yes and the mystery still prevails over the you know tiny little scratchings in the dirt
we've managed to make and have gotten maybe a little too excited about
we can make far better scratchings if making good scratchings this is what you know we're after
but not the way we're at it mostly presently unfortunately
a bat
unfortunately our language and knowledge have sort of dominated us and they're very
kind of crude broken forms as you know as masses of people
and there are those there are those populations of people who are brilliant and insightful and
imaginative and creative or at least very learned right intelligent have acquired wisdom
but most of this is hidden from us right and it's only kind of disseminated through you know
authorized channels so to speak in other words channels to which
which have been or being converted into commodity by
someone something
there's a vast richness of accessible dimensionality
to what's happening to what we are seeing and aware of when we're awake
that our waking mind is ill-equipped to introduce us to and it has another reason why it doesn't
want to it will lose its sovereignty as if it were you know i'm anthropomorphizing the mind
but i'm just playing around but as if it were a guy with a job right or a girl with a job or
someone with a job that depends on keeping all those crystallized narrow skeletons of meaning
and identity in dominance because if some of the actual living mystery were to leak into our
awareness while we are awake it would over immediately overwhelm the dominion of that guy
and he would lose his job and so he wouldn't he would no longer be able to corner the resources
of consciousness to keep producing these collapsed skeletal frames that are uninhabitable for the
imagination and for you know largely for relation and as modernity proceeds you know more and more
of this gets translated into it just gets converted into transactions and we stop you know we don't
have relations any more we just have sort of a ticker tape thing right um of little tokenized
you know what one of uh it's funny i picked up the habits of podcasters i've listened to and
that's not a good thing
i was listening to uh yoshiba on a podcast the other day and he said a variety of extremely
interesting things incredibly intelligent guy which by no means do i agree with everything he has to
say um maybe i should go back toward the light
and he was saying
something like the united states has become
this nation of of like transactional documentation right this is what everyone does
they document transactions um all day like every day and i think what he you know he's
speaking generally but he's saying that's a really strange thing to do and it's a dangerous
investment of attention
and i and i agree with him about that and it's a really bizarre thing to do
but that's the kind of thing the one an aspect of the waking uh anatomy the waking mind's anatomy
an aspect of that anatomy is really into you know do the accounting to the last digit
and part of the reason it's into that is you can keep you can do the accounting on having done
the accounting right so you can keep acquiring dominance in the hierarchy in the momentary
you know interplay of the organs you can keep acquiring dominance and steal more
sort of juice for your projects and so on and if the the actual if anything resembling the
actual character in depth of nature were to intrude into the mind momentarily of a modern
adult human who was unfamiliar with it
i'm fairly sure it would be a crisis unless the tenor of the contact
were so very gentle and tentative and sort of loving and receptive and inviting
in which case you might get out and maybe it would be less of a crisis and more of a miracle
and sometimes that's the difference between insight and insanity
or so it seems though again i mistrust the language wildly and such matters
but yeah if we don't know the first thing if we don't really know what everything is
and what it's doing and where it comes from and it should tell us its story we need to ask the
story of everything and not in numbers in relationships if the universe is
if there are layers of consciousness and awareness above and beyond our own
which i have a very difficult time thinking is not the case i can entertain the thought
they're contactable and their intelligences are not like our language
um
i think a long time ago the humans the old humans they knew
that all of life and all of time and space was a network and it was as if it were one organism
one family with a tree of many branches and that they could travel in that network
with an aspect of their being that had always done that
and is deeply familiar with all of this that aspect is not the thinky conceptual waking mind
and even that you know whatever whatever it is i'm referring to there
it depends on things far stranger and more astonishing than we would suppose for its own
of capacity to limit the structure right to collapse things down into tokens and string them into
sentences and um to pretend that declarations encompass identity and and stuff like that
and you can see the problem with this whole idea of declarations encompassing identity
in the modern you know identity politics cluster storm
sun is setting
thank you
thank you more soon i hope bye bye for now
