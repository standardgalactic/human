Hello, everybody. Welcome. Thanks for joining me today.
You know our minds, what we think of as our minds, our consciousness, our awareness, it's
radically transformable. It can do all kinds of things. Many of us have never imagined.
Some of us have experienced them. And, of course, not all of these things that can be,
not all of the forms of consciousness that we can invoke are desirable. Many of them are
quite undesirable. And unless we practice paying attention and developing awareness,
especially together, most of us won't have access to the vast majority of possibilities
that our incredible humanity conserves. Unfortunately, in our common contexts,
there are large libraries of processes, mechanical processes, commercial processes,
media processes, work processes, habits that we ourselves have developed or succumbed to.
And the nature of our common humanity is a drafting nature. What I mean is, I mean drafting in the
sense that birds in a flock, they draft on each other's movement. And they change positions so
that, say, the lead bird in a V of flying geese, the two birds behind that bird draft on the lead
bird's activity. And the two birds behind them draft on the three birds in front of them. And the
two birds behind them draft on the five birds in front of them. And so they're going together,
but they're synchronized, and they follow each other. And this is how life is in general. This
is a fundamental property of living beings of every kind. Nearly all of them draft on the sun,
but we humans have become confused and have instigated processes that thereafter it could be
said, enslave us. So we're drafting on toxic processes. And this informs the kinds of awareness
and the opportunities for consciousness that we will experience in our lifetime.
It's my personal perspective that it's unhealthy for us to draft on mechanical processes.
Nature's rhythms are not rat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat-tat, right? Or they're not continuously one meter,
right? One tempo. In fact, all of nature's processes are like music. They're symphonic. And they
transform dramatically, even moment to moment. So when we draft on them, there's a great diversity
of intelligence underlying our drafting. The birds can trust, lead bird implicitly. If you put a drone
there, something goes haywire. As you can see in social media, which I think should be called
something else like, I don't know, distributed media catastrophe. Yeah, DMC. You can see people
drafting on each other all the time, right? Or rather, something more like the shadows of what
might have been people doing something where they're kind of defecting from being people together
while pretending to still be people. It's an unfortunate mess. And yet, sometimes it's important
to see something go terribly wrong in order to understand how it might go much more beautifully.
This is a lesson from recent days. Sometimes we have to really see things
go terribly. And maybe they even have to go really badly for a large population before
we're willing to take a look at what we've been carrying on with
together and make an imperative decision to do something better or at least something less wrong.
And in the situations we exist in today, it's really easy to do something less wrong collectively
because most of what we're doing collectively, first of all, isn't really us. It's some stolen
aspect of our social nature. It's been captured and projected and mutated. It's like corporations
are doing gain of function research on the capacity of viral media to stupidify its audiences,
which is a terrible thing. And the children, you know, there are vulnerabilities everywhere,
but our children are extremely vulnerable to this toxicity. And so too are elderly
for different reasons. But yeah, today things are so incredibly fucked up. And yet superficially,
they seem, you know, like everything's just going along. We're not engaged in a world war.
Actually, we sort of are. It's just different kind of war now for the moment.
We're still dealing with all of the old
malades, maladies, diseases that have long infested our collectivity.
So it's really easy for a small collective, particularly, to just do something less wrong
together. The reason that I bring these things up is that if we want to experience something like
something that expands the scope of our awareness and access to other forms of consciousness,
and you see people trying things, you know, to achieve this, some of them are good things,
perhaps, although once they become commodified and commercialized, I become more skeptical about them.
But we see people interested in meditation, or yoga, or perhaps martial arts, somatics,
and we also, there's a large cohort of people who are so interested in having an experience
of transforming their consciousness that they will take a drug to do so, a drug that essentially
forces a transformation of consciousness. You don't have any choice once you've taken the drug,
although you do perhaps have some influence on the outcome.
So there's a hunger, there's a natural thirst to understand what's possible with our minds,
and I don't, to me, understand it academically or intellectually, or rather to experience it.
And believe me when I please, when I tell you that your consciousness has capacities
that are more shocking and astonishing, and in fact unbelievable, even terrifying,
much more astonishing than anything you've ever heard about in human culture, no matter what you've heard.
Because the nature of consciousness is unlike any idea.
And what the nature of our minds as human beings has dimensions,
many of us will never have even a slight taste of while we are alive.
Our minds, I think, were, in a sense, meant, though it's unclear, this isn't the kind of
meant that means someone meant something, but they were meant for forms of adventure and development
and insight that are extremely rare, and yet we do see examples. What we generally don't see
are large cohorts of examples. We often see individual examples of profoundly unexpected
and even unbelievable capacities and faculties.
The universe isn't a network, a network, or rather a network is a derivation
of certain qualities of the universe, and that network, that meta-network that the
universe is, that beyond all networks that it is, is meant for travel between minds.
Now if you don't think that nature is really interested in having minds influence other minds,
just go to a garden and listen to the birds, or if you want to see something a bit more like
the opposite of that, turn on the television and watch the news, or go on the internet,
and what you'll see is all these processes where minds are transforming each other,
some of them trustworthy, I trust those in nature rather implicitly,
and some of them extremely untrustworthy. Most of the distributed artificial
mind influencing games are quite toxic, it seems to me.
Now people are very interested in experiencing the potentials of their minds and consciousness,
and at the outskirts we have people who practice touching other minds,
who learn sensitivities that most of us have been told don't exist,
but yet if our grandmother demonstrated them to us directly, then we can know that they exist,
or our father, or our brother, or our sister, or our friend, and yet the existence of these
faculties poses a threat to the status quo, the existing order of things, and it also poses a threat
to our internalizations of that status quo and the existing order of things,
and so there's a conflict, because if it turns out that my consciousness is capable
of going with you in your consciousness, or touching other minds directly, or discovering
and relating with other intelligences, all of which I say to you your consciousness is made for,
then everything we thought before was wrong, even our fantasies about telepathy and psychism,
and so on, because if you get a taste of actual water, it's not like the stories,
it doesn't resemble models, the experience of tasting water, there is no model that will
encompass it, no language will help you, you have to taste water, and it's the same thing with
transformations of consciousness, you have to taste them to understand their nature, and
many of these things, the capacity to heal each other, to learn at incredible rates,
to develop senses and sensitivities that would seem impossible, for example the capacity to
track the path of the grasshopper through a field some hours after it has passed through,
surely that seems a ridiculous proposition to rational thought, yet that's a trivial
example of the actual capacities of awareness.
Awareness can reach beyond location, identity, temporality,
but in order to have these experiences, and we should be cautious about chasing
super function too intently,
because that purpose is not trustworthy, if we engage in transformations of consciousness
together that result in super function, we should stay with the awareness and continue
the path of development rather than becoming too fascinated with the super function.
This is because the super function is dangerously charismatic, we can become enchanted by it,
and we will lose again the path toward insight and awareness
as we become fascinated instead with powers, remote viewing, for example.
A friend of mine who's a medium,
and I'm not sure what this means, but I'm very clear that she knows how to transform
her awareness in unusual ways with unusual results,
and some academically minded people will try to explain this away and say oh it's a trick,
Darren Brown can do that too, and Darren probably can do that, but it's not clear that because he
uses mechanics that you see he's already shaped his consciousness to discover mechanics
that could simulate forms of consciousness, that he finds the idea of very,
let's just say he's extremely skeptical, if not he just finds this idea antithetical,
so he can simulate things like telepathy and magic and even martial arts power
because he's learned complex things about the nature of human awareness and how to direct
that awareness, and yet while he's doing these things he's actually doing a form of magic
that's deep and true and real, he's reforming human consciousness on the fly for purposes,
and interestingly his one of his purposes
is to demonstrate that there is no telepathy, and his argument is since I can do these things
mechanically as well or even better,
just a moment,
nice,
my birds have come, so I have to say hello to them,
oh that was interesting
two different bird forms are here with me
and they're learning a little bit to get along
where normally they're very competitive,
they're learning to get along because they both know me, I am their friend
and
and so they don't really have to fight,
we'll see how this progresses,
but the scrub jays are tolerating the presence of the stellar's jay couple
which seems to me rather peculiar because it hasn't been going on lately
and also it's mating time and emotions are on high
they're really very beautiful animals
and their awareness can change, their habits will change when the circumstances change
though they're used to defending territory and relationships
under the right circumstances they can share territory and relationships
and that's astonishing and beautiful because life is much easier if they cooperate
they can draft on each other's senses
they can expand their awareness and transform their consciousness
to include me, essentially an alien
and I can include them and there's a position above our individual awareness and consciousness
that we can move our awareness and consciousness into where it becomes shared
I was speaking of a woman that I know
her name is Marla Fries
and she's very skilled at transforming her awareness and her consciousness in unusual ways
and one day after asking me permission
with no discussion beforehand
she walked me through my own home and described the front door, the hallway,
the first room, the second room, the third room, the fourth room, the fifth room
and what I could see out the back window
and who the rooms belong to and so on without asking a single question
she just led me through my own home
and I understood what she was up to and I promise you it wasn't a trick
I am a living point of presence in that environment
she can touch that point of presence and read it, not exactly like a book
more like someone who sees into the nature of minds and their
someone who can touch minds at a distance
and I was impressed but I've done similar things myself though I don't do that kind of thing
professionally and I'm not necessarily looking down on those who might though many of them
are probably untrustworthy and it is possible to concoct illusions
that are profoundly compelling to those who do not understand how they were, you know, their machinations
but the purpose is
the humans probably only rarely emulate that of which they are not already aware
so you don't get mimicry until you have something to mimic
and the people who are capable of mimicking what I'll call mind-sharing faculties
they all started out on that for a reason, right, they had a purpose in mind
and purpose is extremely important for human beings and particularly for consciousness and awareness
if I'm looking at the garden
because I'm bored I'm feeling bored I'm not engaged with myself and so I'm not really
engageable in the garden then I nothing's really very interesting you see nothing draws my attention
toward wonder or curiosity or insight
if I have questions and I'm fascinated if I want to see what lives here and understand the
relationships and I'm passionately engaged in this way my experience of consciousness will be
radically different and I will learn and see and notice things that were otherwise invisible
one's purposes
turn out to have a kind of magical quality
in that they shape and delimit or liberate consciousness and awareness
according to something like their function
and before we move or speak or look at something there's a purpose of
there's a sort of purpose of garden
and ordinarily we become habituated to purposes that are symptomatic of
something like loss of spirit or loss of awareness
and our culture encourages this because it creates and sustains
sort of nightmarish zombie-like mass from which slaves and prisoners and consumers
can be harvested
so I've seen other people demonstrate
super function in a trustworthy way
though I've known only a very small handful who were deeply inspired and curious enough to
to shatter the boxes that most of us trudge around in for a lot of our lives
at least in waking consciousness but consciousness can be transformed and it's always being transformed
what I hope for is that we can rediscover the liberties that are natural to us
and learn to transform consciousness together in ways that are beautiful and inspiring
developmentally healthy liberating and astonishing
now of course it would be very dangerous to suddenly introduce a common human being
to the network of minds
there's a way in which it would be like placing an infant on a freeway
of course there the network of minds doesn't include machines machines are not
capable of how shall I put it existing in that dimension though they're capable of
influencing it from outside
but the network of minds is vast and ancient and all beings that have ever lived and ever will live
participate in it in each moment and it has neighborhoods
it has small neighborhoods and vast neighborhoods
but it's distributed all throughout time and place and our awareness is capable of traveling
in that network and it's more capable if our purposes are beautiful and true and match those
of the majority of the network and the majority of the network is fundamentally benevolent altruistic
and I guess that's what I mean by beautiful
I was looking at the garden in a very relaxed way watching some birds
but then for a moment I became concerned that perhaps someone was observing me
and the form of my awareness transformed immediately into a state of a particular kind of vigilance
as I scanned the perimeter for evidence of possible observers
something like this can happen in our minds by themselves especially in isolation
and the tragedy of our modernity is that over time our schools societies ways of life
and technologies have collapsed toward prison-esque prototypes
where privacy is seen as disposable for the sake of convenience
and this is very very dangerous because it's absolutely imperative that we be capable of
experiencing privacy and of knowing when we're communicating or relating with one another
that we are not being recorded for purposes of possible indictment
or even celebration later because if that awareness if we are aware
not whether or not it's even happening if we are aware it is possible that we're being recorded
this will transform our awareness because we will have to concern ourselves with possible observers
probable observers observers we believe are real
and in the mind this creates a form of dangerous feedback
it transforms awareness in a way that is very difficult for our more nuanced
and intelligent faculties to survive exposure to it's like a kind of radiation early
it's not clear that any of us have much resembling privacy these days
um
where can we be sure we are not being recorded
observed
here in the garden ostensibly because they want to quote control unquote the coyote
population there are game cams
recording devices
and even while i use this phone to record
my wanderings
i am you know self-recording but i cannot be sure that someone else is not listening in
our phone conversations our online activity all of these things comprise a layered panopticon
which is a kind of a prison where the wardens observe the prisoners but the prisoners can't
observe each other or the wardens and in that situation the prisoners can easily be
catastrophically manipulated
in fact they become a commodity
where power games play out and wealth games play out
and the observers acquire abilities of manipulation
that we would otherwise imagine or would only be available to gods or supernatural beings
purposes
if we are to be observed if we have this technology which like language is already
entrenched and we can't get rid of it
we need to do something really astonishing and beautiful amazing and intelligent with it
and we could do that we could do it today
and that's one of my dreams that we may learn to do this together and i have some models of how
we might but that's a different topic
there is in language a kind of peculiar magic that i sometimes briefly remark on
but if you look at the word topic you see top i see
top i see
the t
could be understood to represent a tree with many branches but also something that reaches
upward toward the sky and is an antenna it draws things down from the distributed
consciousness of everything awareness of all beings into a specific thing
from generality to specificity and the o could be understood to represent that body of minds
as a unity and the p in this case
there's different ways to think about it one of them is
it represents the head thinking the mind but another one is it represents paths parts
processes and then the eye that stroke with a little dot above it that little dot is really
important and has a stranger history than we imagine that's a being an individual being or a cohort
and the c could be understood to represent the propagation of signals in the network
or more simply light seeing now this is just a toy like perspective
but there is a deep mystery alive in our languages and if we're curious and intrepid
we can learn astonishing things about how it came to be
that our kind of animal
arose and the processes that we experience in consciousness what were their origins
why is their language why is there an animal like us on earth
these are questions that i'll probably never release
the other night i was thinking rather an insight sort of imposed itself on me suddenly
and often that's the the feeling of it
it isn't as though i'm sitting around you know like rodan's the thinker
contemplating something though sometimes that's going on too
but often i'm just doing something relatively natural and suddenly in my mind poof there's a flower
and i was thinking about honesty
and of course you know as a poet i value music and compression
all these different features of the ways we can use language artfully
but i thought to myself honesty is when the soul is speaking
and that's not like courtrooms or litigations or arguments at all
that's like a bird that's been in a cage for a long time suddenly noticing the door is open
the sky nearby
and it's been in the cage and the cage is safe in its way and predictable
no predators come to the cage
well that's a bit more complex but
and first perhaps it it jumps to the bar at the door stands there for a moment between worlds
and then spreads its wings and leaps for the sky
now for a bird that's always lived in a cage this could be a real problem
because there's things about flying they don't know they may never have flown in wind in their life
they may never have had to fly down the sky might seem like a
like a strange gravidic vortex that just draws them higher and higher and higher
i've heard that some birds when they escape they can't fly down not sure if it's true
but i've seen a couple of instances of it
and yet inside all the birds is something that remembers the before of cages because for most of
history there weren't any cages there weren't any boxes
there were nearly no rectangles
and it struck me that honesty is when the soul is free to speak
and often this might sound like a very simple thing
though we can learn to let the soul speak with the sophisticated language
of artful creative and passionate adults and some of this is music
but often when my soul speaks it's like the voice of a very small child
and it's just saying something very very simple like
that's not right that's not nice that's not kind
that's cruel that's mean we don't have to do that don't let's not do this
often my soul or at least the aspect that reaches my awareness
it's most inclined to speak
in
and about
what is not worth doing or what is dangerous or confusing confused to do
let's not do that
some of its intelligence is prohibitive now in ecstasy my soul will speak differently
in ecstasy my soul is overcome by love and beauty and wonder and awe and the miraculous
but then it doesn't speak it just dances it doesn't have any words if it has to make words
often something's gone terribly wrong
and many of us can understand this because we have experience of being with someone we love or who
we want their love and they don't see us and often in other words they're not present with us
they're not feeling we're not dwelling in the between of our minds together
so that we're sensing together
and so when in this situation when we have to speak often it just makes matters worse
especially in the case of couples
who we must presume have at least briefly known deep intimacy
co-being together within for each other and perhaps within for all beings in all of time
now remember i said that the network of minds
it's not mechanical actually it's not a network it's a body
or it's something even more than a body it's it's beyond the bodies but it's alive right
and this is why i don't really like the idea of network it's more like a forest or a jungle
and in fact the forests and jungles are probably expressions of this as all life forms are
either the physical gives rise to consciousness or consciousness gives rise to the physical
they're certainly both together but most likely one of them has precedence
in the origination process at least in linear time
though they both inform each other but this network it has protocols
and there are protocols that babies begin to learn when they're born
but they get replaced with other imperatives particularly you know the processes of in
languaging and in culturation the processes of structuring consciousness
conceptually
now i don't think we'll ever get rid of language or concepts
theories and models but we can learn to relate with them far more intelligently because
we are in a situation where it is as if i'm walking around with a hammer in one hand
and a knife in the other at all times in consciousness
now i could put different tools there
um i could have a needle in thread in one hand and a cup in the other
but in any case if my hands are always occupied by the same tool
i lose the capacity to understand what hands are for
i cannot caress you properly with a hammer or a knife
and i won't be able to pick up anything else
and i will come to think of my hands in terms of the very limited tools they hold
now yes my ordinary hand cannot do what a hammer does
and my ordinary hand cannot do what a knife does
so it can seem very powerful and compelling to have this hammer and this knife
and this is the problem we have with the results of our in languaging and in culturation
it's as if the hands of our minds which are not merely hands they can become wings or
tentacles or all kinds of astonishing bubbles or you know threads they can transform in all kinds
of ways but we were given something so sticky originally that the hand of our mind just closed
around it and thereafter it became more and more difficult to set it down at all until
eventually we forgot that we were holding a tool and we just thought of our minds as the tool
our minds are recast in the likenesses of these tools and you can see this process going on deeper
and deeper and colonizing new dimensions of our bodies and relationships and minds
and it's really very terrifying there's nothing good about it
yet we live in the world we live in we cannot merely shut it off we will have to learn to do other
things and in order to do that one of the things we will need to learn is how to release the tools
that were embedded in us imprinted in us and that we have confused with the faculties of
imagination love wonder intelligence creativity play mutual concern mutual rescue mutual liberation
i know of these things because i suffer them not because i have solved them
even in this moment my purpose has collapsed vast portions of my awareness with which i could
produce astonishing beauty and wonder insight because even i am using tools that i'm not used to
setting down
the modes of consciousness we usually experience that are common
are very sticky tool like and domineering and when i say they're domineering this makes them sound
like beings and i'm not sure what their categorical status is
but they act a bit like diseases diseases are beings at least well i guess that's a bit complicated
when i'm using the word diseases i'm thinking of the transformations of organisms
and the introduction boundary crossing of organisms
and what we think of as their components or constituents constituents i like better
but this sticky quality it
it traps the hand of our mind in a specific position with a specific tool and eventually
we can't use the hand as a hand anymore we can only use it as the tool it grips
and we have no experience of what it's like when it releases that tool and what the other
things it can do are or the other ways it can be are or what it can become
but if we are aware of this if we notice this particular peculiar problem
then we have the opportunity to learn to release the tools we're familiar with
and explore the hand that held them the hand that was transformed by them
there's something interesting about this word transformation
because it's really two words right now linguistically the phoneme trans
or if that's a phoneme it's a word part
it uh it means something like to change right but the word trance is deeply related
and so transformation
from one angle of purpose and concern can be actually understood as trance formation
because when the sticky habits of language and concept idea maxims
is in our hand the hand of our mind so to speak and again that's not merely a hand that thing can
become anything
that's a transforming power it's a transforming library of faculties
but when we are trapped in our habits we're in a kind of a trance
it's hypnotic in the sense that first of all our volition has been compromised
and now the array of activities and behaviors goals
and dreaming that would ordinarily be possible are severely limited again think of a hand
that always has a hammer in it think of a hand that always has a knife in it always
all day long every day day after day year after year
and this is what it means to be normal
it means to have almost all of the faculties of consciousness
prohibited structurally prohibited by the shape of the flow of awareness
and it's constant in structuring by habit
and when we learn of this
there are two potentials and it's very important to select the correct polarity
the first potential is to indict things oh this is wrong that was bad this is a historical nightmare
the world's going to end my life is destroyed so on and so forth this is looking backward
we could think for example oh i've been doing it wrong my whole life
and that's a very crippling idea
or we can select the other polarity
we can select the forward-looking polarity ah with this understanding
i can restore and recover the opportunities and faculties inherent in my being
my organism my animal my humanity perhaps even my gender
and that's the polarity that matters that's the one that will help us to let go
of the hammer and the knife
and you can see that if the hand is stuck with one tool only even if we have two hands and they
have different tools we're really really trapped right you can't open a door or drive a car or
sew a sweater or draw a picture or write
you can't do any of the amazing things that our hands can do when they're always stuck with a tool in them
it's a powerful metaphor if we use it for liberation rather than indictment
so noticing this together we can be forward-looking into the domain of opportunity
sure we have suffered and lost and made mistakes and been injured and hurt others and hurt ourselves
yes it's all true but that's not the important fact and we already knew this this isn't new information
but the frontier ahead is ripe with astonishing potential and beauty recovery
re-familying together and not just with the humans with all beings in all of time even the future
how could it be that we touch the future well how could it be that we don't
every footstep changes the future for all beings
not just those right here
whatever time is it's nothing like our imagining we're very little like it and whatever space is
well i'll tell you space seems to be
from the tool-like position
a form of distance and separation that renders most of the universe untouchable unreachable
but what if time and space are actually other forms of deeper intimacy
that only occur when certain modes of separation are imposed
and this i think is how something like what's actually going on
by having the illusion of separation or not the illusion what's the right word
by introducing domains of separateness new domains of intimacy arise new possible kinds of intimacy
but the separation is deceptive because nothing is unreachable
there's no mind we can't touch there's no world we can't see there's no place we can't travel to
if our understandings of touching and seeing and travel
recover some of their organic dimensionality
the dimensionality occluded by the tools we use
the other night when i was thinking about honesty and it being the the expression of the soul not the mind
the expression of our essence
not our concepts not our analytical evaluations
it struck me that it's nearly impossible to say truth in language
to say something that is true in language because language is a departure from truth
now different languages are differently departing not all of them are as distant
from truth as others
but language will never approach the truth of a leaf or an ant
or a living place
because language is a representational overlay
it does transform minds though
it can transform minds
so i was thinking about how difficult it is to be honest in language
in courtrooms
i always found this really of confusing and ironic
before a witness takes the stand and all these roles are very interesting to look at because
it's a model limited but still
instructive of something we do in consciousness all the time there's a judge
there's a prosecutor there's a defender there are witnesses there's a defendant
there's a plaintiff and there's an audience
and you can see that this is a model of the tool that the mind of our hand is constantly gripping
whether or not we are aware of it
and that's a really strange model that's a model worth
doubting very deeply i think for most purposes
but before the witness takes the stand
have to do something extremely ironic
now i don't know if it's still done this way i think it probably isn't but
something very similar occurs it used to be that one would have to place one's right hand on the
bible and by the way that gesture is a model of touching the network
it's a very confused model but that's the net that's the model of touching the network of all minds
that's what's actually being represented there
right you're agreeing to include all beings
as arbiters of your honesty
so people would have to place their right hand by the way that's the thinking mind's hand
the left hand is the dreaming mind's hand for most of us
and even those who are left-handed are still mostly lateralized a lot like
not exactly the same but a lot like us right handers
so yeah they place the right hand on the bible which is being held by a clerk
and the clerk says something like
do you solemnly swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth
now this is ironic for a number of interesting reasons
one of them being that i'm pretty sure there are severe admonitions somewhere in the bible
against swearing by things
so that if someone did take the bible both seriously and somewhat literally
and if they universalized the admonitions in the bible to cover not merely the whole book
but all of reality which is something people are commonly found doing
then they would be violating their understanding of the bible to swear by it
and i noticed this as a very young child and and i thought well who knows what i thought
the first time i can't remember i only know what i think now i just i remember thinking
boy that's really confused that just seems bizarre
so that's the first part of the irony but the second part is even more astonishing
we have to swear in the name of all beings to do the impossible in language
to tell in words the truth and not merely the the truth right but the whole truth
so i think if i got up there i mean i can't imagine how i would answer a question
right if i were the witness and i had been forced to swear this way which i would resist
very furiously i would have to start out with something like well in the beginning
there was light or you know and the light was alive and universes were born out of it
and the humans acquired representational consciousness you know i would be like
i couldn't answer any question first of all i would declare that it is impossible to tell the truth
it is impossible cubed to tell the whole truth and the idea of telling nothing but the truth
is insane
and this is the kind of weirdness we you know have been imprinted with
it's this form of insanity
that pretends itself rational and good and benevolent and true and trustworthy
if we had to use a system like that to accomplish anything it would fail
i mean it's first move attacks its own route
it's like somebody who knocks their own feet out from underneath them and then
complains when they fall on their face
now of course these tools are useful to navigate representational structured contexts
but how useful are they if their first move cripples us
yes we can still navigate okay i know how to obey the stop sign or the green light or the crosswalk or
you know and i understand about jobs and banks and money and all kinds of you know things
but the situation places us at odds with ourselves at odds with our essential being
and that being learns to hide
and as it hides its faculties are hidden and those are the faculties with which we were
capable of acquiring representational intelligence and language and what we refer to as culture
as children and they were better than the tools they acquired
and this is something we must learn to remember and discover together
i think when i was reflecting on honesty i began to think about the difference between
the public self and the private self and how these two things have to be
it's important that there are boundaries there right
they shouldn't just blur together and many of our technologies are forcing them to blur together
so that there is no ostensibly private self and the processes of civilism god hate that word
the processes of the malware that we currently run as societies intrude into our bodies and minds
in ways that can only be understood as catastrophic violations terrible egregious violations
of our humanity and integrity our interiority our imagination
and so most of us will live and die as prisoners of these processes our hands glued to tools
we can't we weren't even equipped to detect
let alone empowered to release
but we can and will learn together to understand these things
we will explore we will discover
the true frontier is not space it's awareness it's consciousness
and the astonishing peculiarities and unexpected blessings
very deep beneath
the layers of structure and bullshit mimicry advertising
that often overcome our waking minds and dominate them
private honesty two people alone together knowing they're not being recorded or observed
is an entirely different thing from public honesty
if there can even be such a thing as public honesty
and of course we could say well there are degrees
and that's what the phrase the whole truth is meant to overcome
we don't want your degrees of truth we want the whole thing
hold nothing back
but if anyone were to I mean just the idea of attempting to tell the whole truth right
well we decided that we were going to try to tell the whole truth
we did some math about this and we determined that it would take
400 000 trillion years just to lay the foundation in language
yeah you just have infinite courtroom
and part of the problem there is that apparently some people like to think
that the divine beings comprise a courtroom judgment is their primary
you know indictment and judgment and punishment and and you know reward and so on is their uh
their bailiwick their occupation no I don't think so
though the consciousness of the everything
is like a tree with many many branches
and some of those branches may be
specialized
some of them might be a bit like a knife
some of them a bit like a hammer some like a cup some like a needle and thread
now I don't know the deepest nature of the great mystery of being but
it doesn't resemble a courtroom in my experience
if anything it resembles
a beloved family worthy of the deepest kinds of trust and adoration
and it also resembles something like a beautiful university not like our kind
a different kind where it isn't the intellect we educate it's the essence
a school for souls perhaps
and of course when I was thinking about honesty
I'm not sure why I was I don't know why the thought came into my mind but it did
so
the birds are here again
so I will pause for a moment
minds transform when they join
and when I'm with the birds
our minds join it takes time for them to get to know me for me to get to know them
and for trust
to form
but once there's trust our minds begin to join
and I won't say they transmit thoughts directly to my mind
but the place where the shared consciousness is is not obvious to our ordinary consciousness
and until we learn how to sense it it's largely invisible
it doesn't mean there's no transmission or there's no benefit
it just means we're not consciously aware of it
in a sense the idea of love
is now of course I said the idea of love but
love
is a desire
to emerge into being moment to moment together within for each other
a desire to share minds and hearts and souls and lineages
a desire to grow in ways that might be nearly impossible alone
but one might say that love is remembering
we have this same interesting thing going on here we have the same thing with
the re-presentation but re-membraying
right to become unity again to remember together
you
the potentials of minds in union
especially when their union is the result of beautiful purposes
is fundamentally miraculous
and I think has the power to transform any problem any problem
it's sad that we think we have to depend on our own individual thoughts and awareness and consciousness
it's a bit like
a situation where someone is in a garden filled with fruits and vegetables
but they've been trained to eat stones
and so they just sit there eating stones and being very miserable
and again I know of this because I experience it
it
wow
that was a really interesting vetting behavior from the stellar's chair
she was very suspicious of the peanut
and so she she went through a series of evaluative behaviors and tests
before she was willing to pick it up
the birds know that it's a risk
to pick something up in their beaks
it changes how they fly
changes all kinds of things
for them their beaks are more like hands
than their feet are though their feet look like hands
but they use their beaks and their feet together
for manipulating
remembering
love is like the memory of original unity which pervades all being at all times
but is easily lost in the structured landscape of thought language concept habit
cities what we call civilization
it's funny I had forgotten the metaphor of the sticky process that
that cripples are the hands and wings and organs of our consciousness and awareness
by trapping them
in a specific and repetitive collapse ways of collapsing
now the collapsing isn't itself bad
it's the
entrainment that's the problem
I think
so I feel a modest sense of accomplishment today in recovering that very important idea
quite accidentally
I hope you've enjoyed today's walk and talk
and wondering and remembering how to see together
the principle of looking forward in the sense of
taking insight into opportunity rather than criticism right using insight
to move in the direction of opportunity rather than in the direction of indictment
is very important in learning to unclasp the hands of our minds and release
the tools that have too long dominated them too long and cruelly dominated them
and again though I can see these things I'm only modestly capable of doing them
by myself most of the time but put me with inspired others and immediately my capabilities
transform you know
if someone is at home having a cup of tea maybe they are listening to music
and suddenly a SWAT team breaks into their house and starts yelling you know put your hands
on the floor and blah blah all this stuff right you can see their consciousness will radically
transform that will not be the same person who was there a moment ago drinking tea and listening
to music we could say well it's a version of the person yes of course but it's a version of the
person coupled with their circumstances similarly if someone became separated from a family member
long ago and the family member disappeared and people come to their house with their
brother or sister and say oh we've you know we found your brother or sister they will transform
everything will change all right
so the nature of our capacities for recovering the faculties of consciousness and awareness
you know you can chase it alone and some successfully do so many of these become
monks or yogis or perhaps something even stranger an entirely ordinary person who has seen through
the mind right it penetrated the veils of the layers of habit and thought language and idea
and touched the original light recovered that that original light
and this might be an entirely ordinary person with no special obvious qualities
in fact when we find people demonstrating superpowers in public there's often great danger
there there's an agenda the purpose you know it's become maybe contaminated
so
it's very important that we use insight to look forward toward opportunity
rather than backward towards shame or embarrassment or indictment about previous things
so
oh i guess i can't go this way anymore part of the garden has been walled off it's unfortunate
going to build something there that really doesn't belong in the garden
in my view
the other really important thing you know keep in mind the idea of the hand that can't let go
of the tool that mastered it in youth and also remain aware that our purposes the purpose of
underpinnings of our awareness are crucially important because they predetermine the results
of their pursuit if our purpose is too narrow
too representational we lose access to many of the faculties and potentials of our consciousness
our minds our imagination and our awareness an imagination turns out to be extremely important
um i'm not a fan of the secret but there's something called intention or intent
and this is a very powerful uh capacity of our of our human nature if we form an intent
and pursue it um with focus and passion curiosity
the future opens up before us in a way deeply related to that intent and
it's not as simple as the popular ideas suppose and there's also something sacred about it
that resists and hides from
public
it resists being converted to a commodity
all of these matters are sacred matters
if your purpose is so good and so beautiful that all beings would agree and celebrate it
then you get access
that's funny
earlier i'll just finish a thread that i left off of the vast network of minds and beings
it has something like protocols
there are signaling protocols there are request protocols
there are answering protocols there are travel protocols
and they're all really simple and beautiful in their way easy to understand again
little babies know about this stuff but by the time they can speak the structured mass they've
inherited overwhelms their early intelligence largely replacing it although traces of it
will always remain however deeply buried
when i met the birds
you know i used old protocols to establish trust
i took my time i was patient they live in a different temporal frame than i do
and this is also important because when we share minds time is transformed
it gains new dimensions and those dimensions acquire character from our activity purpose
behavior together
but the transports in the vast mystery of being they have protocols and they're fairly simple
but one of the simplest is if your purpose is so beautiful and good and true that all beings
provide and all beings would recognize
its altruism this changes all games
there's a family beyond all possible ideas of families
it includes stars and galaxies and time space and nebula whales and mice ants and bees trees
flowers herbs beings who have died beings not yet born
there's an incredible family
with which we can be reunited
i want to travel the networks of intelligence
not just with my fellow humans certainly with them as well
but within for all beings for i adore them
the humans are a deeply troubled animal afflicted and crippled but i adore them
they are my people all of the humans they're my people
and frankly
i'd like to open all the cages we possibly can together
and taste the sky of our true nature creativity intelligence wonder and beauty together
to remember together
and give answer to the grave injustice
that we have suffered and propagated
not an answer of punishment an answer of transformation
and you know it may not be possible to swallow the moon so to speak or eat a mountain
but at the same time
it is possible to introduce something so incredible
so beautiful so beneficial that nobody wants to be left out
and in that direction there's hope
and even if i cannot change the world
i can make a difference here and there
even in the brief opportunities of a momentary exchange
with someone who i could think of as a stranger
i rarely think that way
so scope right if we reduce the scope from the world to my relationships
the miracles become vastly more accessible
and to me whatever might be meant by the word truth is fundamentally miraculous
it's not declarative
thank you for joining me i look forward to learning together again very soon
