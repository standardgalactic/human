Hello everybody.
I'm out today on a walk
to see the ocean.
And I think that perhaps I can hear
the roar of the waves far away.
There may be a little wind
and some mic noise as there often
is here in San Francisco,
but I like to make recordings when I'm out walking.
So hopefully it won't be too bad.
Right now in the distance
there is something that happens all the time
which is
a five to six block long
convoy of motorcycles.
It's an extremely noisome
thing.
It's particularly troubling that they've decided
to go take their route through
Golden Gate Park.
But
well, you know,
we all experience things.
And
some of the things we experience, we find them disturbing
and undesirable.
And some of the things we experience we are neutral toward
and some things we find enjoyable.
And so we have an affinity
for those things that we find enjoyable.
And we have a disaffinity for those things that we would prefer not to
relate with.
And then we are sort of non-plussed
by other things.
Now of course
what we experience
depends on
our way of being in our bodies and our minds.
And so
if I am very
focused on the beauty of the sky and the trees
and the sounds of the birds,
I may not even pay much attention to the fact of the motorcycle convoy.
But if I am very concerned
about someone or something
ranging, penetrating,
unfairly subjecting me to something I do not want,
then not only will I certainly notice the motorcycles
but I will become upset
and I will feel that a violation
is occurring. They are forcing me to hear
these terrible sounds.
And frankly
in general, I think loud motorcycles
are a terrible thing
because they subject people to a bad sound
very loudly, sometimes a sound that can be heard for miles.
And what's going on there?
I could feel entitled
to not be subjected to this, to be protected from this.
And in fact I do feel
a sense of that entitlement. This is unjust.
And it's some kind of ego game
that usually some male
has an incredibly loud
machine that is incredibly loud on purpose
and penetrates everything. The dogs, the cats,
the houses, the people, the car alarms go off when it goes by.
There's no way to justify this. This is simply wrong
in my view.
And so I am sensitive to it. I do not want it.
And more I want it to be
prohibited. I want it to be prohibited.
This is wrong. No one should be able to subject everyone
to their egoic
insecure masculine
machine.
And in fact I have a similar
issue with many bizarre displays of
childish masculinity
and perhaps even some bizarre
displays of childish femininity. If I think of these
things in this way, I don't have to. I can choose
how to think about them. I can remove the gendering
and just say, ah this person, what are they doing?
What's up with this? Why are they subjecting everyone around them
to something that is troubling
or in some way triggering or so on.
So just like
all of us, I have affinities and disaffinities, likes
and dislikes, desires and aversions.
And then I also have neutrality.
Or all of these things are continua, right? They are
matters of degree.
There are some foods I like somewhat.
There are some foods I generally like. Some foods I like a lot.
Some foods I adore. Some foods I make me ecstatic.
I'm like, oh this is the best food I've ever had.
And similarly at the negative end of the spectrum it's a continuum.
There are many gatherings in the park
and the motorcycle gathering is one of them, but
I think it's fairly clear that that kind of thing does not belong in the park, which is a sanctuary for people.
To relax and to experience nature
and to have food together and gather
and play, play music
there's a big gathering off to my left where people are playing music
and having a picnic
and maybe playing volleyball.
The music is so loud
that it must be very difficult for the people who are near the source of it
to have a conversation at all.
Why is the music so loud?
What is being served by that?
You know,
there are features of our environment that are natural
that are very difficult. When the sun is extremely hot
it's hard to be comfortable.
When the sun is hidden
and it is very very cold
it's hard to be comfortable.
There's some aspect of
my own consciousness that
jealously guards my comfort.
You are intruding on my comfort. I am triggered.
Now what do I have to do?
Now I have to do something
because I am triggered. I have to come have a talk with you
or we have to have some conflict or there has to be a report
or something like this.
It's funny
this was not my intended topic
and I may move toward my intended topic.
But I wanted to take a moment
and explore this because
it's quite a fascinating thing.
I am identified with my comfort and desires.
What I mean by that is that I easily confuse them
with myself. I perceive my comfort as myself.
And so if my comfort is impinged on
or violated it feels like a violation of
me, my body
if indeed my body is
me.
And I would argue that or propose rather
that there's a way in which that's true my body is me and there's many ways
in which that's not
extensive enough to be me.
In some way I am all beings
and so if someone
else is violated I may feel violated.
I may identify with their suffering or their joy
and this is natural to us.
But under certain conditions we become
a kind of very small self
particularly if we are under a lot of stress or isolated or alone
we are sick or injured or vulnerable we are being dominated
we are imprisoned we are in poverty we are homeless
we are suffering
a long array of grave injustices that have
deeply inhibited our capacity for joy and development and relation
then
we may become very sensitive
perhaps hypersensitive
so that something that we would ordinarily pass over without the slightest moment
of regard becomes a mountain
in our felt sense
of self.
And this is natural for all human beings
we appreciate
praise and opportunity and comfort and wealth
and we are angered by violations
things we can take as violations. Now of course all of this involves
what we make of our experience
and what we will make is fundamentally
up. It's
prefab by how we are in the moment
in our body and the situation.
If we are generally happy and joyful
and having fun and playing and growing and learning and creating
of course we are much less likely to take offense
and offense is a very heavy
thing to take and carry. I know for I often have done it
and sometimes do it. And if things are rough and we are
troubled and alone we might become frightened. We might take fear.
What can I say about these things that is actually useful?
Well, I can speak of practice
the practice of awareness
allows us to make a bigger bubble
than the thing that is offending or oppressing us.
Or less likely but also profound
the thing we are enjoying in a door
love. That which we feel is nourishing us.
So when these things arise
we can practice making a bigger bubble.
We leave the stimuli or the situation
in a little bubble and then we make a much bigger bubble
of self around that. And that bubble includes all kinds
of little bubbles of history and memory and dreaming and play
and loss and suffering and fear and pain
but we can make a bigger bubble.
I saw a meme, not a huge fan of memes
but it said that my son
when I was putting my son to bed he was talking about something his teacher had said earlier in the day
and she said something like
imagine that there is a pond and the pond is filled with fish
and let's say there are eight fishes and the fishes are feelings
be the pond
not the fish
and I think
the meme ended with primary school has come a long
way since I was a kid
and this is
the kind of thing I am talking about with practice
we can make a bigger bubble of the self
and when we make a bigger bubble we are free
we gain degrees of liberty that otherwise
without
which we would be trapped in a very small self
and strangely as we begin to react to things in our lives
whether we react
joy and hope and faith and wonder and awe and love
adoration, affinity
we like these things
because we feel like we are expanding
they release
inhibitions and limitations and we feel
deep and open
and capable of
joy and self development and nourishment
and that's natural
however there is a bigger bubble than that
too
and strangely my concern is with the things that trouble us
for these feel like we are being squished
I am being contracted
strangely if we think about our pupil
the pupil in our eyes
in the presence of more light
the pupil contracts becomes smaller
the less light it dilates
becomes large
once I remember
an African American woman came to my home
she was delivering groceries and we were talking a bit
and her pupils were extremely dilated
and I mentioned to her
very dilated and she says oh yes people often
comment on this they think perhaps I'm on drugs or something
and I said no that's not what I was thinking
but once she told me that this was a common
experience for her that her pupils were almost always
dilated wide open could barely see
her iris
and she said oh you know
we're from this place in Africa
I can't remember the precise place
and I said I wonder if
your ancestors were so used to being in bright sunlight
that over time they developed the genetic
predisposition
to oh that's actually backwards
isn't it
that's funny never realized this
having a little moment of insight here
oh no I had it right
where you lived
where your people lived the sun was so bright
your pupils were almost always contracted very small
and here where we live the sun is so much less bright
that your pupils naturally
dilate right they expand
and she was fascinated by this it had never occurred to her before
and I felt very happy this was a moment of affinity between us
we were having a little insight together and it was beautiful
it's hard for us to
know
the history
our ancestry
the developments
in our genome and so on including our microbiome
that predispose us
to certain kinds of environments which we may no longer inhabit
now the humans travel all over the world
they leave the context in which
for perhaps millions of years
certainly hundreds of thousands of years their bodies
were adapted to this particular place
the intelligence of place
and how our bodies naturally evolved
within that situation
and adapt
I'm at a lake
in which people play with toy boats
and this one
that I'm looking at is a hydrofoil
and it's a boat that rises up out of the water
on legs as it accelerates
producing less drag
from the water meaning the hull
and expansion is like that it's like less drag
more freedom, more degrees of freedom
so
it can be very useful to practice
in the face of fear or pain or isolation
and just allow a bigger bubble
of self, the self, our awareness, our heart
our feelings so that
the pointy thing that's hurting us
or disturbing us it dissolves
it just becomes one star in the constellation
and then one star in the galaxy and then one star in the universe
it's okay, we're okay
now this is easy to say in words
it's very simple to say oh just make a bigger self
it's not so easy to do but as we practice it
and as we repeat this practice when we come to
a place where we are stuck and frightened and alone
and disturbed and angry and confused
eventually it becomes more natural for us
to dilate the self rather than contract it
and that dilation lets
more light in
it lets more light in, more of the light of our original nature
more of the light of our intelligence, more of the light of our freedoms
and our potential freedoms
more openness, more space, more love
more compassion for ourselves and other beings
this is a very powerful practice though it sounds quite simple
in other words it's not a simple thing
but with practice it's a bit like working muscles
we become
more flexible
and better able to
work with challenging circumstances
and eventually we may even practice this with
affinities
so that we are not so attached to the food that we like best
that we cannot enjoy other food
there are amazing possibilities here and this is
a feature of the practice of mindfulness
maintaining awareness, openness, flexibility
not grasping at what we like and don't like
at least less severely
releasing the grip, the gripping hand of
the small aspect of mind and self
that is very reactive
and really it is this reactiveness that is the source of our pain
more than the actual situation
with people who are deeply practiced
they are often able to
place themselves in a state of mind
where for example they can have surgery
without anesthesia, now this is a very
extreme example
of the possibilities
within the purview of our humanity
to have this kind of experience
these are skills we can develop
but developing them depends either on
what we bring to our human birth, what we develop while we are here
and then also
whether or not we practice
mindfulness and awareness so that we can
make very big bubbles in a situation where otherwise
we would be profoundly constrained and in pain
suffering
and this isn't to say, this isn't to make any value judgments
oh those people who suffer, they are just not developed enough
that's not
mindful, that's a weird
misapplication of rationality
and what I'm speaking about is not closely related to rationality at all
it's related to something far deeper
than anything rationality can get at
so it's important, this little feature of what I'm talking about
that we are gentle and generous with ourselves and we realize
that I am at the place in development where I am at and that's fine
that's good
I will keep developing and I may
decide to practice mindfulness and awareness
particularly in situations where I feel triggered
and if I really want to be skillful
in situations where I feel attracted
because nobody wants to get rid of the good experiences
we'd like to keep those, I like the food I like
I like the girls I like, I like the cars I like
the games I like, the books I like
the ideologies I prefer
no one wants to get rid of those but
practicing there can also be very powerful
a bigger bubble where
I am not so compelled by my affinities and disaffinities
and so I have more freedom and
I may begin to understand
ah
I am not
merely this very small
earth that I ordinarily identify with
I am vast as the universe
I am all the beings in all of time and not just the material beings
I am origin
I am God, I am goddess
and not in the egotistical way, not in the thinking way
but the direct experience of this
I am inclined to grasp and grip and identify at all
I am beyond gods and goddesses
I am
the undifferentiated potential from which all things arise
a vital dynamic living
field of origin and expression
again, not as a thought
the thought will not help you much
except that you may pursue it
the desire for
liberation from the small self
is powerfully beneficial
when employed intelligently
you know, in case you think
for example
this is all very interesting what Darren is saying
I've heard it before in other forms
probably true
yet what I actually experience is
what I actually experience as the small
self in my body while I'm awake
the raging angry noise of the motorcycles
that don't belong in the park
is real to me and all this fluffy stuff that Darren is saying
is just a kind of fantasy
I am just me, I am just this one person here
well, isn't it interesting
that when you dream
you're probably almost
never alone
your mind becomes not merely you
but the people and circumstances and situation and the world
with which you appear to be interacting with in your dream
so when left to its own devices
so to speak, I don't really like that trope
when left to its own natural way of being
our minds create worlds
and they create other people
and all of the people in the dream
are the expressions
of the original light of consciousness
or awareness or origin
being differentiated
transforming, having adventures
and of course there are many kinds of dreams, there are dreams with no people in them
there are dreams with no places in them
there are dreams with no light in them
there are dreams that happen just in darkness
but usually when we think of a dream
we think of something that resembles
what I'm speaking of
an imaginal adventure
an imaginal universe
and notice that in our dreams our emotions are different
the way we experience things is not the same as when we are awake
there's a intrinsic fascination
going on
even if it's troubling
there are many many hummingbirds here
and many other birds but the hummingbirds kind of stand out
because of the extremely high pitch of their vocalizations
vocalizations
there are lakes here
in Golden Gate Park and right now they
are wrong
I have a strong disaffinity to what I'm seeing
the humans have put some kind of chemical in the water
there are thousands of water birds and fish here
and other aquatic organisms
and the water is the wrong color
it is too green blue and this is because the humans have put chemicals in the water
and it's bad
the humans think they have to control the growth of undesirable
organisms you see and it's really weird what affinity and disaffinity
become at the level of our cultures and societies and institutions
because fundamentally there's no humans in there
it's a weird and
rather terrifying array of processes
that just unintelligently keep spawning behaviors and processes
that are lethal both in the sense of forgetting
like the River Lethe in which we are
dipped between lives and forget
in the mythical stories
of probably the Greeks
but also lethal in the sense of killing
just unconditional devastation
that seems to have some organizing idea behind it
which is usually the control of novelty
the limitation of novelty
the imposition of what we think is more
predictable and thus good and cities are made of this
and languages made of this and my actual initial
urge here
which I may touch on briefly
is the problem of nouns
you know if we ask what went wrong
with human cognition
in the biblical story
we are given a word
and the word is knowledge
but before we can have knowledge
we
pretty much have to be able to name things
and that naming
is problematical in the same way that
the bad chemistry and the water is killing stuff
the naming
and particularly the nounal
aspect of knowledge and linguistic behavior and
consciousness is deeply dangerous because
once we have a noun
we end the big bubble and we make a tiny little bubble
that is a token
and we fall under the delusion
that we now know what something is
because we know it's name ah there are some ducks
since I know their name I know what they are
but one thing it's impossible for them to be ducks
whatever they might be has nothing to do with this word duck
nothing oh there is a koi in the water
oh a koi I know what that is it's a fish
all we're doing is traversing
a semantic tree
and thinking that the cuts we make give us
power over the things we name
and this has been a complex mess throughout the development of human cognition
if you know a thing's name you have power over it a magical power
and this power is
enacted and embodied in our human societies where
your name is sort of like a slave caller for the societies and the institutions
they track you and trace you and charge you and bill you
prosecute and persecute you
in all kinds of ways and nearly never
is your name a blessing in this sense
until it is spoken by one dearly beloved
then you know there is something beautiful
there
why do I say that the noun is a problem
well
in older languages
identity was understood in
a transforming way
a verbal way process
transformation this becomes that becomes this
and in this sense we have freedom
from
the tiny self
I hear a raptor's call
the trapped
little tiny bubble that becomes
constricted over time
because if I am transforming
if I am relationships rather than static
things
the apparitions that nouns produce in consciousness the figures and
figments
then it's hard to hurt me
if you hurt me here I travel there
my awareness travels where the hurt is not
it becomes all the unhurt things
and also things that cannot be violated
in ordinary ways at all
or maybe things for which it is impossible to violate them
they are inviolable
so one of the fundamental problems
particularly for those of us who speak English
and more particularly for those of us who only speak English
rather than a much older language
or an indigenous language
is that we are trapped in a world of nouns
static identities
static identities, quantifications
descriptions, evaluations
and we are partly trapped because
this is the world that nounal
behavior linguistic behavior
imposes on awareness
this world is false there is no such world as that
or if we are to admit that there is some degree of relevance there
it's merely a denotative relevance
it's just I point at this with this word
the word does not tell us what the thing is
what the being is or is doing
even if we attach some few qualities to a duck
oh it flies, it eats things in the water, it swims, it makes eggs
a house, a bill, and so on
these are trivial representational things
again having nearly nothing to do with duckness
and what is duckness actually? it is a great mystery
it is the entire universe appearing before us
all of time and space, all the beings who have ever lived or will live
appearing before us in a form
that is of origin and the great unity of all beings
in a way that's somewhat magical
it's certainly non-ordinary to our regular ways of thinking
and also the duck is a process and the duck is
relationships
the duck is transforming
not merely a bird, not merely an organism
not merely a being, not merely a word
so these nouns are very deceptive
they give the representational aspect of our minds
the impression of having encompassed
the identity of something and seeing that identity
is static, extremely limited
possibly utilitarian, oh we get eggs from ducks
or we can kill ducks and eat them
or ducks are pretty and bring beauty to the little pond outside my house
this kind of thing
yeah it probably is
I followed you, but I'm not blaming you
well we all follow each other a little bit
sometimes to something good
where are you from? Brazil
well welcome on behalf of the San Franciscans
I'm walking to the ocean
it's a long journey
it's very nearby, can you hear it? yeah, we're close
yeah I started way back on 8th Avenue
I live over there, it is
I love to see the water though
that's right
I was just trying to avoid the street
exactly
what brings you to San Francisco? Game developers conference
yeah I've built a few games in my time
roleplaying games
oh no kidding, yeah I was playing D&D back probably before
you were born
do you work on any specific project may I ask?
yes, we released Dungeons & Dragons Ark Alliance last year
in a few years we'll be releasing your Dungeons & Dragons game
oh wow, that's exciting, I play Neverwinter
it's not very good
back in the day it was pretty good, but they got to do it in the age period
fundamental to D&D is the idea of random encounters
and there are no random encounters in Neverwinter
none, zero, all the encounters are preset
I think our next game is not going to have random encounters
but I think there are many facets
even a big discussion was, is our game going to have character customization
some people are saying that's even more
so I ended up encountering
a friendly soul
and having a long walk
and talk on the beach with
Igor
who is a game developer
and a fascinating person
I think we got a few miles in
in the surf
and almost got knocked over a couple of times
and the arc of our conversation
has
made it a little difficult for me to recover
my previous thread, though I remember talking about nouns
and the strange
they're a strange relationship with identity
they're easily grasped
by the
representational aspect of cognition
and this aspect is
inclined
is somehow right hand like
for those of us who are right handed
it's the gripping thing
and once it can grasp something in this way
it feels a sense of oh now
I know
completely what something is, does, is for
and so on
so there's an even tinier, more constricted self within us
a linguistic self
and its concerns and way of being in the world
are extremely limited
but seem to it to be almost omnipotent
so it's multiply deceptive
the old verbal languages
where identity and meaning and relation
were consistently brought to mind
even in single words
whose particles
brought into awareness
marriages
of being in situation and relationship and time
night and day, hot and cold, male and female
up and down
in and out
all these things were in constant transforming relation
and so the old languages were much richer
and our fascination with and vulnerability
to nounal consciousness and thinking
has led to catastrophic deprivations
in our capacities for understanding and intelligence
while at the same time providing us with the strange
complement of technological advancement
and you can see that in technological advancement
is there's a vast propagation of things, objects
millions of little packets of ketchup
700 different kinds of packets
tomorrow 900, the next day 1000, so on
endless cars and boxes and machines and rectangles and books
and advertisements and logos and companies and so on
imagine living in a culture where there was none of that
there was no such thing
as a fake identity
a corporation, Honda
city bank, facebook
and no images
except perhaps the sacred sand paintings
or
the images on our huts
or teepees that reminded us of the world of origin
few or no representations of identity
what a great relief that would be
a great relief
to return to the biblical story
in the Garden of Eden, a story I think which is
much richer and more profound than it appears to us
and
some evangelists might opine on
what is meant by this word knowledge, why is it the tree of knowledge
that is the problem and what happens thereafter
but fundamentally what happens is that
we lose our direct experience of
and participation in interbeing
and so we are trapped in a kind of death
which is the constriction of the small self
the I, the me, the location of my body
the circumstances of me alone and against
the world
and this is a kind of death even though
as the serpent
equivocates
with Eve in the story
half true
but over time your people will
die inside to their experience of participation
in the great
living dream of the cosmos
and it seems that
the possibility of naming things
is a fundamental
catalyst of this ongoing
sort of living death that we experience
ever more profusely in
modernity
so this was my initial
thought about what I might speak about today
the trouble with nouns and I suspect
that Ian McGilchrist in his new book
The Matter With Things
probably explores this very deeply
the thingification of experience
breaking it up into
little distinct isolates
that are understood as static
this is the fundamental problem with nouns
is that they make static that which is fundamentally dynamic
and they make local that which is fundamentally relational and distributed
and so we begin over time to perceive
in light of the form
proposed and imposed
on mental experience by nouns
it doesn't have to be this way
and if we become aware
of this together we can retrieve
some of the degrees of liberty that have been lost and possibly
prevent new degrees of liberty
but first we must have this awareness of the problem
we must be able to understand that in a deep way
not in a superficial way
but knowing the name of something is really just a lexical token
it tells us nearly nothing about what it would mean to be in deep relation
not just with the duck
but with the entire living place
the continuum of all beings in all of time
our true family, our true home
what we might call the world of origin
or the domain of origin
that timeless source
of not merely light
but the astonishing
and miraculous modes of light
that give rise to
our minds moment to moment and throughout our lifetimes
that give rise to living places
and organisms and ecologies and relationships
these are the natural expressions of a form of something we could refer to
light but it doesn't just mean the brightness
very difficult to speak about these things for our language
is not inclined to develop
the features
and ways of speaking
that would be helpful here
what I hear mean by light
how shall I
possibly approach this
is
the ecstatic
primordial
wonder, adoration, dynamism
and transcendental
transcendental
oneness, unity, communion
from which universes and beings
emerge as natural expressions
and instances
of this communion
all of this is lost to a noun
a noun posits a world of
separated distinct things
objects, moments, transactions
and it carries with it
a library of implied values
and also something like the opposite of values
that we will ignore once we begin playing
in the world of names and catalogues
and categories and so on in this way
it is these things that are ignored
that are most essential and worthy of resurrection
to our awareness and consideration
all fascination and wonder
it's been a long walk
now night is falling
the fog is coming
things will become blurry and indistinct
the imagination will rise
as the sun sets
and soon will be the time of dreaming
thank you for joining me
I look forward to learning together again soon
bye bye for now
