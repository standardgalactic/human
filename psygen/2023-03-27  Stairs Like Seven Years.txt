Like your stares were seven years of music, long rain listening inside those clouds of
colored fish, like dogs whose limbs dissembled from lithe forms should they advance upon
the air, a leg, a tail, a floating ear, small diverging teams of lost eyes, these endless
shapes reflected, they lit through dark elixir, a stark extraction of directions,
thundered, sundered, and respected. They stole in Africa's whose numbers they
might start to speak, yet stutter, then fall dead into disastrous structured
histories, so perfectly exemplary, their language is distracting as our mercies
are defective. And this, like sentence, held to bear imprudent implications, raw
and true, the half-bright witness tells a starry murder's misframed purpose, all a
thunder, wrecked, now shattered like the chalice graced with heaven's dew. The babes
yet born before they did begin, I, your seven stares of music, years long hands,
and lain inside wise wings, and inside these fierce mysteries.
