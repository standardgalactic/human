I am at the place where I ordinarily think of
as a social pond. It's the largest very small body of water in the botanical gardens.
So the whole topic that I was going to talk about has just dissolved into another topic because
I am watching one of the most astonishing things, but I have defected by being willing to make
this recording instead of simply attending and participating in what I can see. And what I can
see is I am watching the water and its surface is very mirror like in the afternoon. And the surface
is fairly calm, but it is warbling. The surface of the water is warbling. Or maybe that's an auditory term.
I can see very complex patterns of gentle wave like movement all over the surface. And in that movement are reflected trees fairly clearly.
And as I watch the wavelets passing along the length of the tree, they produce a visual situation.
But they also produce a sort of self-amplifying wave within the other waves that suggests a hidden dimension of movement.
There is a dimension orthogonal to our visual senses that is suggested by the pattern of the ripples and the transformation of the reflections.
Now, one thing I don't know is where is the reflection? It's a three-dimensional sense. And when I look down into the water, it is as if I am looking up into the sky.
And the whole affair is extremely profound, but what happened a moment ago is that some crows flew by. So I was watching the crows flying in the upside-down mirror.
And they were calling to one another, and the calling appeared to undergo a dramatic frequency transformation, sort of a reverse Doppler, where at first the calls were high-pitched and common.
And then as they got just a little further away from me, they transformed and seemed to elongate and lower in frequency.
This social pond, I call it this because it's very protected. Water birds passing through the area might be likely to at least visit the spot, especially if they needed protection, though there are nearby coyotes.
And I once at night heard what I'm fairly sure is a coyote getting, uh, preying upon a duck because the duck made sounds I have certainly never heard from a duck.
I'm still watching the water. And it's so funny. There are certain phenomena in nature.
Okay, actually it's much weirder than that. By the way, I've been kneeling and there's two, four, six, eight, ten carp looking up at me from the water, right, where I've been kneeling.
And it's enchanting to think that it's all the magic of I love the carp and they love me, but I'm pretty sure it involves them having been fed by humans for many, many generations and being synanthropically linked and aware of humans.
So this phenomenon that I'm experiencing, which I have defected from by talking about it, let's be clear. It's like I see the most beautiful woman in the universe. She beckons to me.
And instead of embracing her, I'm going to lecture about her beauty and profundity to my peers, right. That's the degree of ignorance I'm displaying at the moment.
So funny on the other side of the little bridge, the sun is reflected in the water and the situation is so much different. It's almost like a different universe on these two sides.
On this side, the sky is blue. There are a few cotton balls. The reflections of the trees are bright green and golden and gray and different colors. On this side, everything is like black and white.
There's a painting of tufts thin layered tufts of cloud. The reflections of these trees in the palms are all black and the sun.
Also, the wavelets are not complex in the same visual way they are on the other side. So one of the things I was asking a moment ago is where is the reflection?
It is not, we all will think the reflection is clearly on the surface of the water. This is our natural rational mind.
But I suspect that like the rainbow, the reflection is not located anywhere at all. It moves as I move.
You know, instead of if a tree falls in the forest, is there any sound? Perhaps a similar but more useful in some ways question is, if the light hits the water of the social pond and there are no eyes seeing it, is there a reflection there?
Like, is the reflection actually there?
Now with these kinds of questions we should acknowledge, I'm going to be very rational for a moment, a problem with the question. If a tree falls in the forest, there isn't a forest without other sonically sensitive creatures.
And the plants themselves are likely to be sonically sensitive. All of the bacteria in the soil, probably sonically sensitive.
So, what he's really asking is something more like, but he's using the wrong theater, because you won't have a forest without beings.
Like a forest is unembodied, both unitary, it's just one thing, and diverse, the many, many participants.
All forests are like this. So there's no forest.
And then you can take the question apart a little bit differently in language and ask, a tree falls in a forest with no humans.
Since humans specify sonic vibrations in atmospheres with the word sound and there are no humans there, does the sound emerge?
There's lots of ways to approach the question, right? Is there a sound if there are no humans to call it a sound? Is another way.
And then, I think as I said previously, not to repeat myself, but inside a box, if I click a clicker and there are no observers and nothing, we can insulate the box from the outside.
Does the sound happen in there? What happens in there? What is that?
And obviously, it should be obvious to us that at the very least, unobserved phenomena comprise a special category of conceptual reference, right?
Unobserved phenomenon are the subjects of human cognitive conceptual manipulation, right?
So they exist, but they exist in the subcategory, right? They first exist for us in the category of what we might call imagination or speculation.
Now, there is a problem where if you removed humans, not sure this is actually possible, but you might be able to extinguish them.
But if you removed humans from Earth, all human concepts go with them.
At least, presuming that the resulting now, and then again now, right, the resulting existence, iterations of existence, except they're not iterations, it's a wave.
I think the raptors are mating this moon. They're being particularly demonstrative today.
Katoi, the moon where, at least in the Blackfoot territory, is different in different places.
This is the winter moon where food supplies are running out.
And our survival depends on us sharing together.
It is cold, little ones and elderly, some of them are dying.
There are accidents.
The ice and cold are severe. Food is difficult to obtain.
Have to share from whatever we have stored up.
Probably the concept that interest in commerce, compounding interest in commerce, is a lethal abstraction of.
The extra. We have to share the extra, and if you invert that, you have to give us extra.
Because we had a relationship ten years ago, for a minute.
We have to give us extra forever.
Alright, so much to get out here.
Without exhausting my listeners, and thank you for bearing with me, all of you who do.
Was it Bishop Berkeley question about this tree in the forest? I can't remember, for sure.
But the question of where is the rainbow?
A question meaningfully posed in my experience by Owen Barfield in saving me appearances.
Subtext, a study in idolatry.
Very interesting subtext title there.
Similarly, I think the reflection in the water. I am really not sure where that is.
It is probably in the relationship between my awareness, the sky, the water's surface, light, time.
I mean, my body, my ancestors, this place on earth, this time on earth, all these things, right?
All of these produce the reflection in the water through their complementary participation or something.
In that each adds something to the recipe until what emerges is, and this is where things are going to get a little weird, folks.
What actually emerges is a portal to another universe.
A nobody who hasn't experienced this.
And certainly nearly zero rational pragmatic scientific people or science-y-minded people.
There is no chance of them believing me.
Apologies for all the noise.
It's weird, I went from a literally placid, calming, profound visual experience to a very disturbing auditory experience.
Hopefully most of that is done with.
No one will believe, very few people will believe, that that reflection on the surface of the water comprises a transport, which is what I just suggested.
Now I am going to make other absurd suggestions of similar ilk.
In fact, they're going, if you think that's crazy, wait till you see where I'm going.
I remember a beautiful afternoon a long time ago when my father was with me and I took him to a place in these gardens called the Moon Pool.
And the Moon Pool's purpose, well, the reason it is called that way, has to do with a traditional Japanese,
a specific Japanese tradition involving the creation and maintenance of small, beautiful pools of water in which one could observe the moon on clear nights.
Ironically, this Moon Pool cannot be used unless you break the rules of the garden and stay often long after closing.
No one really comes to kick you out generally, though they could, if possible.
Now I understand.
Wow, I just learned something astonishing.
I've got to stay with the topic or we'll just keep branching wildly.
The people who came before us, the people of long ago, especially before there were cities and when the peoples, the human peoples,
had very intimate relationships with living places and creatures and developed very sophisticated and intelligent traditional knowledge systems
that were technologies in the sense of partly being comprised of methods,
but they were relational technologies rather than physical technologies.
The ancient peoples were aware and sensitive to and sensorially and consciously aware of and receptive to
what we could call languages but we'd be lying, transformations of the manifold of consciousness and relation in the living places around them.
And some of those peoples who have existing progeny still maintain some portion of the library of the knowledge they once held.
And others, there are examples in which either the knowledge wasn't preserved or it was not very well developed.
And I mentioned this just so that we don't become confused and think,
Darren means all indigenous people were relational geniuses.
It seems unlikely.
The diversity of tribal forms and places and times and situations produces a diversity of what we might call more and less.
I keep wanting to use the word intelligence but it's not correct.
Branches where there are complex forms of deep relational awareness and understanding and branches where there are less complex forms of toolmaking, problem solving, so forth.
By the way, once you start getting towards toolmaking, the things probably going away soon.
Because by the time that happens, colonists from elsewhere are going to bring guns and just wipe you in disease and gold and whiskey and whatever, just wipe you out.
And enslave what they can't wipe out.
Because those people were already infected with that disease themselves long time ago.
In any case, the ancient peoples knew something that I'm going to talk about today.
And this came up in a conversation with my dear brother JK the other night.
And what a conversation that was, I gotta say.
In a sense, where I'm going to go now is in a direction related perhaps to teleology.
Associated questions.
Why are there humans?
And what are we supposed to be doing?
Presuming that there might be, whether or not there's in the sky a great supposed to her, Tony and Johnny Sposta.
We wrote the book.
What you're supposed to do.
We live in joysy.
So whether or not there's a great supposed to her in the sky, there certainly are a vast array of forms of relational prodigy.
That the human animal is born equipped for and becomes uniquely more equipped for throughout each of its developmental cycles.
As if, literally, you're looking at a kind of a flower that develops multiple different forms of blossoms.
Each productive of both nectar and pollen in different life phases and even in different circumstances.
The shape, mode and the kind of a pollinator that's being sought by this invisible flower inside us changes dramatically.
And in a sense, holy shit, okay, you could imagine, I'm actually having trouble because of the degree of, because of the profundity of the metaphor I've just stumbled on, which I have never seen before.
Shit, okay.
So, you can see that all of the features of modernity have weaponized the production inside us in our felt sense of orientation, purpose, motive, all these things.
Potential relation, actual relation, simulated relation, potential intelligence, actual intelligence, simulated intelligence, potential romance, actual, simulated, potential sex, actual sex, simulated sex.
potential heroism, actual heroism, simulated heroism,
all of these potential wealth, actual wealth,
having probably nothing to do with money, simulated wealth,
the stuff you get in video games.
You can see that all of the branches of the
of the
the domineering,
penetrative,
false masculine aspects
of civilization, modernity, commerce, language, concept,
religion, politics, so on.
These are
causally shaping, and I would argue amputating,
they're amputating the kinds of flowers inside us that don't
produce pollen and nectar they can steal
and commodify, right, which is these days just human attention.
Primary commodity on the face of the earth isn't money, it's human attention.
So you can see these
basically non-human protocols or algorithms.
They are
a vast library of para-algorithmic processes
that infect humans at the level of
relation and cognition.
These processes I call thrips, right, they
reshape the flowers we will produce
to those better suited to extraction.
That's the goal, extraction.
Slavery, extraction, rape are basically
the primary goals of
enacted by thrips
in human
megacultures
and small cultures.
So all these things are shaping the flowers I was talking about, but those
flowers were meant
for relation with actual pollinators.
And this is the crazy thing.
And what are the actual pollinators?
They are nature
itself, well, it, themselves.
I don't know how to
what the pronoun for the source of pronouns is.
But the earth as a biorelational hyper structure which is more than a being and
produces beings
as an intentional side product of
its natural activity
and being the same kind of a flowering differently over time thing
whose pollinators exist
in crude physical form
as if the earth were an ovum
in the gravity womb
of the sun
whose gender we need not state since there's not going to be any gender
without that thing around here.
Once again you have
a meta position but
if in this model for
just to trigger people we call the sun masculine and the earth feminine
and we imagine that the earth
is a transcendent biorelational hyper structure in
in a sort of a marriage with
the fabric of time space, the
the transcendences that dwell there and the sun
and the moon of course
then
we can see the transformations in the moon change the kinds of literal flowers
the earth produces
change which pollinators
tend them and why
and so forth, right?
So I'm enraptured by this metaphor
because as single humans
we were born for kinds of relationships we don't
believe exist
we don't have language or concepts for them
and some of the only
similar things we have
are things from religion
some specific branches of philosophy
basically zero, well not zero
we can get a lot of symbiosis
wow
there's certain branches of biology and perhaps psychology that could teach us
something about these matters
and then
we have addiction
which is basically the selection of
the frustrated selection of substitutes for pollination
that would otherwise be occurring
if our culture wasn't
both failing to produce the contexts in which the pollinators thrive
much as we're doing in the actual
ecologies of earth
by poisoning them
and monoculturing them
we're doing these
our species does the things
that's the reason the metaphor is so powerful
so just imagine over time you're meant to produce all these different flowers
different forms of nectar
different kinds of pollen
some features of which
are penetrative in that they outwardly seek
for
relational
participatory fulfillment
and some receptive
in that
they actively attract
and filter, just like the other one does
forms of
relational
intimacy
and fulfillment
give me a moment, I'm recalibrating
hi
you will notice this principle in every aspect of human behavior
this is so foundational
and this is what happened is I started at a pretty foundational
point of interest
and then I slipped accidentally by watching the reflection into a much
deeper one
and then
due to my great good fortune
that happened again and I came up with a metaphor I've never seen before
well actually I've known this before, I never formalized it in consciousness
so that I could say it
so you produce these flowers
over time
different life phases, different flowers
you almost never see authentic pollinators
gods and angels
demons, vampires, zombies
these are representative
supernatural fictions
or myths
I'm not saying they're fictions exactly
clearly there's plenty that's vampiric
about human culture
or rather especially human techno culture
and similarly there's, you know, zombiedom is real
or at least we've made it real
like canthropy
there must be another word that just means to change into an animal
perhaps
the word
on a wall
might have that
connotation
in some
circles
that's real
so I'm going to
circle back
where is the reflection?
why would I say something so crazy sounding
as
under certain conditions
human consciousness
is able
and by consciousness I don't just mean the kind of thing we're familiar with
I mean the actual stuff
the essence of our being
which we could call a soul
is able to utilize
features of the natural environment
to achieve what I'll call
a perceptual and relational
and possibly a temporal superposition
and from there
it naturally will travel
it is made for travel
and this is what I meant earlier
when I talked about teleology what are we here for
why
what are we good at
what are we supposed to be doing in one kind of language
and what are we the most fit for that we are relatively unaware of
in another kind of language
now ancient peoples
developed
technologies
that were a mechanical
in the sense they were relational
and they were fundamentally
features involving the intentional transformation of consciousness
and I will argue
that one of the most common goals
of that attempt
which very often succeeded
probably nearly always succeeded in the cases of many of the humans who've
ever lived
in fact can succeed for us pretty quick
under the right conditions
with a little help
and by help I mean relationships not drugs
though drugs under some conditions can produce
related phenomena in consciousness
so what are we fit for
and what I'm trying to say
is that
in the same way
that fish appear to be fit for swimming
we are fit
for travel
within the body mind
of something we have never
well
some science fiction and fantasy authors have conceived of at least
things that resemble it
something we have no common
concepts about at all
the closest concepts we have are things like words like the universe
time space
creation
reality existence
uh... the possibility space
these are phrases that point at what I call the supercontainer
which is
the everything
it's it's the parent from which all phenomena
inherit their qualities and potentials purposes
if they have such
purposive natures
which they certainly have
uh...
so
i think it's important
it's important to not have an explicitly closed model of the supercontainer
if you think
you have a firm grasp upon it
that mistake
will make you dumb
and trap you in all kinds of ways
so whatever the supercontainer is
i'm gonna call it the universe within an asterisk and the asterisk represents
everything i don't i haven't
everything i don't know can't know
haven't said can't say
you know the actual possibility space discovery space and so forth all these
things
i do not think of it
as a thing
it's not an object
the asterisk is it's non-ordinary
originating
aspect
so we have to have incompleteness built baked in
and this is something english is terrible
in any case
i think you get the idea you don't want
an explicit closed definition of the supercontainer
anything that tries to explicitly close it and say this is what it is
comprises an attack on the supercontainer
and some of those attacks are useful for perspective but some of them are lethal
for what they
evict from our awareness
and access
so
when i talk about time space or the sun or the earth
often use the term transcendent
it's a neologism
which i invented
i think
uh... more than twenty years ago in my writings
whatever the universe is
is meta to that
i don't have a word
and the only word i have is
originary
or something
and so the universe is not a thing
it is not merely a being
it is a category above being
in my common thought
but nonetheless
in consciousness i tend to personate it
in cognition and in
category
or i
i meta-personate it
so that it's more than a being but being ish
if that makes any sense
and we are meant to travel in that
we are born for travel in that
i would argue that we are born from travel in that
now there are many other ways to look at this but
when william s burrows
who said
a couple of very interesting things
one
he probably isn't the first person to say this but he's certainly the first to popularize it i think
language is a virus from outer space
there's probably a lot more wisdom in that comment
then can possibly appear immediately
to consciousness from
considering its implications
and that turns out to be true
even if the statement isn't true
it's such a useful lens that it doesn't matter whether it's true or not it's really useful
for those who intend to make good use of such a lens
but the other thing and this is the thing that struck me when i was looking at the reflection in the water and wondering
where is
the reflection
and you know in case someone thinks they can answer this question they can't because
it's impossible to produce an unobserved reflection
for testing
this is why the unobserved comprises a special category
of things we can think or speak about, speculate
about
and sometimes we can
weasel our way
into a method of observation
usually technologically for humans
but for the older humans at what they didn't have
large hadron colliders and things they had to do the experiments
with consciousness and transforming it
and what i will argue is that if you merely like there are many layers and if you just go up one or two
okay up isn't necessarily true
if you move one or two layers
there's sort of two directions
there's a direction more toward physical sensation which turns out
to be filled with portals to travel
if the physical sensations become
if they are intensified in certain ways that don't merely cause us to like shut down or run away
they lead to feedback events
that resemble orgasm and let me be very clear that the physical orgasm is one
branch on a tree with a thousand branches or maybe an infinite number of branches
that humans are capable of developing
and not so many of the people who become connoisseurs of physical orgasm
will come to understand that there are other kinds
and when i speak of travel
in the thing i haven't named yet
uh... that is one of the kinds that is
an ecstatic
experience of liberation from
everything familiar
not always
from
many limitations that are familiar
and what i was arguing was that the ancient peoples
if you want specific evidence of this
the
uh... in stories of toll tech
and perhaps aztec
mixatec
and other
south american
and central american indigenous peoples
there are traditions
where training
for certain kind of travel
involves
mirrors
now obviously it was difficult
we can't be sure of this
we are likely to think it was difficult
for ancient peoples to produce good mirrors
but they had
bowls of water
and
they could also
produce
black mirrors, obsidian mirrors
we have the tropes
of magic
uh... that involve gypsies looking into crystal balls and so forth
and i'm not trying to denigrate
that trope
only to say that um...
it doesn't originate from having been made up
it's not from make-believe
one can train consciousness
to produce feedback with almost any form of a shiny surface
under the right conditions of feedback consciousness
will begin to travel
there's various different kinds of ways it can travel
that flower
that i spoke of, the invisible flowers inside us
the cycles of flowering
in our life
paths
throughout our life histories
these
are meant to attract pollinators
and produce
a broad array
of rather than children
what i will refer to as prodigies or
geniuses
when you see someone
doing something that looks relatively superhuman
five-year-old children
playing the guitar
with
a skill rivaling or exceeding
that of well-studied adults
or you have
a singer
you know on one of these shows that
are monumentally popular
who looks like nobody, ordinary person
they open their mouths
and the fucking curtain falls like it's over
what's coming out of that person is
like unadulterated ecstatic prodigy
of enacted being
so
this is actually our nature
as humans in one sense
not all of us at all times
but we are meant
we are supposed to have direct experience of
the forms of prodigy and genius
that each of us naturally produces but especially that we can only produce
in synergy with others like us
others of like purpose
history, tradition, agreement
this is why
the devastating
self-colonizing diseases of modernity
we must establish the bulwark against them together for each other
we must do something other than that
together
now
for each other
to whatever degree we are capable
of just moving in that direction we don't have to get it right we don't have to get it perfect
we just have to learn each time we make a move
and hopefully we're doing that
hopefully I'm doing that even right now
in this walk and talk
to some degree
so Burroughs said something else
something rather enigmatic and profound
which is that
we are here to go
now many have supposed
that what he meant
and certainly part of what he meant
was that we are here to go to space
we are made for
well Burroughs was highly critical of humans
and
clearly
he was aware that
we are not merely human
number one
number two under certain conditions
non-human intelligences can
simply step down into this
layer
and inhabit the sock puppet
that appears to be a human body
now these are
extremely dangerous
things to be aware of
for anyone inclined to
melancholia
or paranoia
or schizophrenia or psychosis
very very dangerous
so I think he meant you know we're here
to go to space but I suspect
and I certainly mean something much much crazier than that
I shall return
alright
recalibrating
what
the pointer
the points in the direction
of that within which I say we are made to travel
what it's pointing at
can be conceived of in
a broad variety of ways and
it is something we hope
to encounter but we are also terrified of encountering
and there are many layers
different layers we can differentiate
some of them are familiar to us
so for example
we have two words
that are important here
one is trance
and the other is dreaming
ordinarily when we use these words we think they refer to one thing
this is not the case
our actual potentials
are profoundly different
from our expectations
there are many different aspects and kinds
of dreaming
and there are many different aspects of trance
and kinds
and they are related
to trance
I have arrived at the edge
of a still small
but much larger
body of water
and the reflection
upon it appears
I'm looking toward the sun
toward the direction of the sun and its reflection
and
at the social pond
the very colorful
elaborate and inviting reflection was on the other side of the bridge from
the sun direction
perhaps
the reflection will change
when I make it to
the other side of this lake
which used to be called Stow Lake
and is now called Blue Heron Lake apparently
so the thing
we are made for travel in and you will notice
that if you want to discover what humans are made for we just have to watch what they actually do
and then
expand
so that we can see that from outside of it
and we will then be able to understand new things about its structure
and its
purposeiveness
features of
non-human ontology
not merely human ontology
and not merely human epistemology
you can see that
if we make circles for ontology and epistemology
similarly if we make a circle for what a human is
actually let's start there
so the first circle is the thing I'm pointing to that we can travel in
that we are made for travel in
some would call it the universe
I think it's the wrong reference frame
because it's not
merely physical time space though physical time space is quite profound
it's something that produces
physical time space
either as an intended effect or a side effect of what it is and is doing
much like the sun produces
the sun plus the earth plus the time space plus the organisms plus the moon etc
is productive of minds
so the thing we travel in
or can travel in I call them my arc
and it has the connotation of
the specific branched
vectored array
of near and distant neighbors
of my families of original intelligence and nature
coupled to all others
so it is everyone and everything
but it is also a layered near neighbor library of arrays
it's also a living library of
everything that is possible
that ever happened that could happen
that can't happen all these things
it is a library but the books are not
the books are not things
they are more than merely beings
and we can travel in this
this is what we are made to travel in
this is what we do when we are dreaming
it is what we simulate when we use our smart phones or the internet
it is both
it is at the same time
impersonal in many ways
and profoundly personal
in many other ways
in fact it has no qualities
in general its qualities are produced by
angle purpose vector of approach
in a sense perspective
if you circle an object in visual space
you will see very surprising things about
its shape
a flying heron
is an amazing thing
amazing being
I am circling the lake
the reflection is still similar to before
though in the shadows there is more
hmm
so the other night when I was talking with JK
and I am not using that in the meme sense of just kidding
I said something like this
the biorelational hyper structure
the earth is and supports
is actually a broad array of vehicles
and the humans are perhaps
the animal in some senses
endowed with the most diverse
opportunities
to join with that vehicle
sorry there is a heron flying right over me
its pretty astonishing
to join with that vehicle
in ecstatic mutual
travel relation exploration
recollection
adoration wonder
ecstasy awe play
all of these things learning
and so in a sense
from this perspective
we are like fish
we are like fish who are being kept alive
outside of water which we have never experienced
and the water for our kind of fish
is
what the symbiotic communal activity
of the organisms of earth are doing
and are being
and when we are placed properly in that water
which in many cases is best done
simply by removing all that impedes that
it does not necessarily we got to add something
we have to get rid of a bunch of things
we have to stop paying attention to x, y and z
in order to naturally kind of attune
if you will
to the ambient
wave like pulses
not just the frequency these words are
value laden from woo culture and so on
but even though they are value laden from woo culture
we should not dismiss the idea
there is a phenomenon called
photic driving
which
okay so we are going to go back to
William S. Burroughs
one of his close collaborators and companion
and similarly
one of my
strangest and most brilliant friends
David Woodard
Geissen appears to have invented
a device known as a dream machine
I have one of these which was composed by David Woodard
in the 90s
this device uses
a turntable
and a geometrically carved tube
inside of which there is a light bulb
to produce flickering
visual flickering
and
and
the device is usually used
by placing your face close to this rotating cylinder
and closing your eyes
and letting the flickering happen
at a specific rate
this flickering with eyes closed
and it certainly has a profound effect with eyes opened as well
is productive of feedback
in our nervous system
particularly visual system
that pulsing begins to set up a standing wave
in the nervous system
once there is a standing wave of some kind in the nervous system
and I would argue that trance and hypnosis are similar
in some forms of them are similar to this
or even essentially are this
consciousness turns out to be a bit like water
if you can get it pulsing
you are likely to be able to produce
what I will call
gosh what do I want to call this
ah
let me describe it
um
or rather
let me point at some analogies for it
so tears, crying, authentic crying
is a version of this
where our awareness
our consciousness coupled with our emotionality
our sensitivities, our concerns, our histories, so forth
these things combine to comprise a sort of a waving pulse
and that waving pulse eventually collapses into crying
I can do this very quickly on purpose
if I simply call to mind certain events from my life
laughter is another example of
the waveform suddenly achieving a kind of ecstasis
from its ordinary layer
opening into a new layer
obviously human sexuality
doesn't always only involve rhythmic stimulation
but profoundly involves it
temporalized, mutual
not merely stimulation but like evocation
invocation
again wave-like phenomena, right?
and so what I'm trying to say is that
there are many forms of waves we can produce
and lots if not all of them have
a sort of a portal
at the top of a certain way of making the wave
or a certain
or
a transition from one
order of feedback
to a new order of feedback
that is different and more coherent
now obviously we can crash, right?
like psychosis and schizophrenia and paranoia
and megalomania and things like this
these are naturally
occurring modes of feedback
producing
not entirely incoherent modes
and orders of it
but
I can't explain
I cannot easily explain the difference between the pathologies
and the superfunctions of humans
because they're so intimately related
nonetheless it is possible to produce waves in awareness
with the body's energies and so forth
that naturally lead
to emergence in a different order
of awareness, ability and so forth
the singer on stage is doing this
the guitar player is doing this, the dancer is doing this
the football player on a good day is doing this
the orator is doing this
the author is doing this
the animals
are doing it too
but they're not doing it as represent
yeah
that's a dangerous branch, I'll stay away from that for the moment
alright so
we are here to go, here to go where? well, trivially into space
people like
Elon Musk
Eric Weinstein
and a number of others
you know, want to take humans to space
I would definitely put the cork in the bottle of that genie
until, oh wow
at least until the humans
are capable of forming
societies intelligent enough to know
what not to do
otherwise
you know, as in the story of
what
Babel
the gods, Elohim or whatever
are concerned that the humans will
tear down the foundations of heaven
and
humans plus machines certainly have that ability
humans without machines might have that ability
so I would put a cork in that bottle
I don't think the imperative
mustn't be, quick get us to other planets
we can destroy with the same
insanity, we're destroying this one
but rather
get us to experiences
that will teach us how to be human again together
and travel in the my arc
is that kind of experience
and we are partially doing it when we dream
we're almost there
and we are also uniquely, weirdly close to it
when we have
hypnagogic experience
in the liminal space between
waking and dreaming
and hypnopompic experience in the liminal space between
dreaming and waking
these resemble dawn and dusk, right?
they're both a transformation of the light
they also resemble the two sides of the bridge in the reflection
they are
unique transformations of the light
with a library of
useful features
and potentials and opportunities
each with unique libraries of these
for a long time I have
been very concerned about
problems with dreaming in humans
and particularly the eviction of dreaming in childhood
and I thought
the ancient peoples when they were
conducting ceremony
many things were happening here, this is not
this is not a one thing
you know, my friend JK was asking
what were the pyramids for and I said
if you build something like that, it's not for one thing
the ancient peoples seem to have understood
variously among them
in different times and places
how to build things with many many features
right?
the dumb analogy
is a toolbox
the
very dangerous
upscale analogy is a computer
jump one scale up from that
jump one scale up from that
you have what the humans are referring to as artificial
intelligences
very complex topic for another essay
and one of the things that motivated me to begin recording
today because I was listening to
Brian Keating interviewing his friend
Moe
whose last name I cannot recall at the moment
and
I with all respect
some of Keating's perspectives
about the likely danger
what the actual dangers of AI are
seemed to me
to be
well
I don't wish to defame
Dr. Keating because he's brilliant
and I love his work
but some of what he said
that he felt might limit the danger of AI
seemed quite naive to me
um
there are so many things
I'd like to say about that
but I'm going to resist the urge to stay on this topic because thankfully
that problem
led me here
through a strange series of labyrinthine
twistings and turnings
it led me to recall
the conversation the other night with JK
and when he asked me what the pyramids were for
I did
suggest some possibilities
um
but I will mention here
because they are covalent with the topic of this conversation
um
um
what I said was
they're probably for
7 crucially important astonishing things
and 24 others
um
however when he asked me that question
what I asked him in return was
have you ever been to
the mountains?
and
you know we talked we were actually talking about
um
Jewish religion
and Islamic religion
tangentially
we were talking about Moses getting the tablets from the mountains
um
but I just asked him have you ever been to the mountains and he said yes
and I said you know was it different there
and he said yeah what do you mean
and I talked about the first time I went
to see actually the only time I went to see Mount Shasta
and
this is a big deal for me
um there was a very
intense rainstorm
uh covering part of the route there
and uh
when we got there
I remember seeing
the mountain from a little village
nearby that had a sort of
um
what you call it
a kiosk except it was all
old barnwood
sort of messy, crazy
uh
picnic you know benches outside
like you'd see it at a park
and the town was very old style
little village not really a town
anyway we got some food and we were
looking at the mountain from afar
I don't know how much to trust this memory
I just know what I remember
and
there was lightning
happening around the mountains peak
and I remember it being orange and green
and blue and purple
and yellow and white
and just
the stuff that I've never seen anything like it
I've seen quite a bit of lightning living in the San Joaquin Valley
nothing like that
I was completely blown away
and as we were sitting facing this direction
from behind me
I hear
what is clearly
an indigenous song
uh
man is singing
um
and I can emulate the kind of sound
though I don't know his song
ah
this sort of
this sort of thing right
I'm telling you straight up
and what that guy was doing
was conditioning
our minds and our souls
in preparation to travel
he was taking us to the runway
not the airport but he told us
stories of the mountains and the flood
um
he told us that the bear took all of the animals up to the mountain
because the bear knew the flood was coming
and that it came
and that they did not know
whether it was safe because there was a terrible fog or something
they could not tell
if it was safe to go down so they sent
a crow who was then white
to go look
and he told us that the mountains are a family too
and this I ended up having a direct experience of
when I was there by the way when I was watching that
lightning and listening I was not intoxicated
I was in my what we could call
sober consciousness ha ha
and he just came in and basically
gave us
the ancient equivalent not of an intoxicant
but of a form of
a relation that conditions awareness
so that it becomes uniquely
more like it starts to form
the traveling body
and the moderns have all kinds
of stories about shamans and so forth
but they don't understand this very fundamental thing
that one of the features of your being
is a traveling body
and that thing
if you wake up in your room
and you go to turn the light on
and it does not go on
and then so you think to yourself
as I once did
okay there must be something wrong with the light or the electricity
let me get my flashlight and I go to turn the flashlight on
and it doesn't go on
I may have
I may flash through a variety of
discrete states very quickly
so that unless we could slow consciousness down
we will not be aware of the transitions
and I realize
hmm
something more fundamental is wrong
it's not a problem with electricity
something
strange is happening
I won't here to limit
you know
seven different states that I might quickly transition through
once I begin to notice
how could it be that my flashlight doesn't produce light
is there a problem with light
right
and that particular question
is in the direction
of travel and often right after that
the person will realize
oh shit
I am still asleep
and by the way you know
I say oh shit as a kind of
exclamation
but that exclamation turns out to be important
because I will argue
that our guts and our intestines
function in an unusual way
when
certain conditions obtain
and the physical body begins to produce a traveling body
and this form of
hmm
usually hypnopompic
is a problem that I am proposing here
what is happening
can be understood from one useful
from an array of useful perspectives
as the attempt to form the traveling body but it failed
it didn't completely
switch over to the next layer so to speak
the waveform did not
form the second rung on the ladder of forms of feedback
or the third
wherein the fourth one is you just start to travel immediately
you don't intend to travel
you don't have to intend to travel
the traveling body is like a bird
in the air or a fish in the water it naturally just travels
in the my arc
and this is what
was probably pointed toward
by the castanetian
traditions which are distortions
probably of
traditions proper to
certain tribes in south and central America
over certain periods of time
but
when
when in castanetian traditions we hear
the word sorcerer
we are
in the presence
of knowledge ways that encode
for these abilities
so to
nahualism to become an animal
this is one of the forms of travel
I would argue our species
was evolutionarily
produced for in a sense
and also by in another sense
oh my god
thirty eight
thirty seven
thirty seven
all of his life are there
in a room
it's so funny the conversation I just stumbled into
my god only in San Francisco
that car almost got hit by a bus
even though the bus is making noise and there's all kinds of lights
so the conversation is really
important in a sense
a young
a beautiful young couple
very striking
were talking and about to eat candy
caramels I think
and the man said
I heard him say thirty seven
and the woman laughed and said thirty eight
and clearly
they were talking about harems
and the woman made a joke
she said yes he told me he'd only been married once
but to thirty seven women
you know by all means
rather than attack the idea
flip it over
she had only been married once to an entire tribe of men
and all the space is in between
monogamy
has powerful
origins in biology
but
that rung of the ladder
leads to other rungs
and all I'm trying to say is
your idea that you are physically located in space
is mostly wrong
it's true
only for certain
wave forms
so to speak
of consciousness
the form that we are trained to use
in childhood to navigate representational
human culture
is a trap
it
we are fish made to swim in ninety
thousand kinds of different water
each kind does different things
and instead of water
we are being made to
experience sand hot dry sand
lethal to the traveling body
made to experience that
as if it mimicked
certain some features of water
and the better it mimics some features
the more quote popular unquote it becomes
this is the death of the traveling body
this is torment for fishes
or birds
so
in the situation where I wake up
I try to turn the light on it doesn't go on
I try to turn my flashlight on it doesn't go on
and lots of other strange adventures happen
sometimes I'm kind of half drunk
I'm like stumbly and I know something's wrong
I try to go find help
but there isn't any and I try to come back to the room
then literally
in the present
language of Madeleine Engel
naming her second brilliant
book
a wind in the door
I try to re-enter the room
in my
half form traveling body
I'm stumbling around in my house I don't know what's going on
I try to re-enter the room in which I'm sleeping and there is a wind
blowing out from the door
and other
non-ordinary effects sometimes often
right at the edge of some portal one will encounter
a force that is like a kind of living electricity
and by the way that's the boundary
between the rung of the latter
where consciousness is not yet producing
totally coherent
feedback
that will naturally
promote the state to the next
position above it so to speak
a superposition of its previous position
a position with more degrees of liberty
than its previous position
doesn't have to be up or down or in or out either one
naturally we suppose up is better
so people are like raise your frequency
not necessarily a good idea
especially for a human's ignorant of
the dangers and necessities of such things
so yeah
there's often a wind in the door
I can't remember Langell's first book
its title perhaps it'll come to me
I mean her name literally means
the angel Madeline the angel
is trying to teach little kids about these matters
and in her books
the children both
well I think they meet an angel
Langell resembles a tesseract
if I'm remembering
this is a long time ago
when you see the pictures
of the angels and the thrones and the dominions
and the seraphim and the caribbean
all of the orders of the angels which I say these words with honor
not derision
almost all of them have wings notice that
it means they travel in the my arc
and there are certain forms of stillness
that are productive of travel notice that
when we have hypnagogic or hypnopompic experience
body is paralyzed
I would
so many little branches here
so yeah you think you're located
somewhere in space and somewhere in time
it's not untrue
but the scope of that
familiar sense
is extremely limited compared to the scope
available to your awareness
and
I don't care
much about the objections
of people who have not had such experiences
people who don't want such experiences
certain kinds of scientists and philosophers
and materialists and so forth especially
limited materialists they'll just be saying things like
yeah you know
your brain can produce a whole bunch of different kinds of hallucinations
and
if you want to get lost in that
it's the same as just doing drugs or
no it's not it's not at all the same
because one can
there's a library older than time
that our bodies are made to participate in
all the discoveries of those scientists are derivations
from that library what I'm arguing is that
the library can be contacted directly
by individual humans for purposes
it can be you can develop relationships
within that library that are extremely profound
and beyond the wildest hopes of science
or religion
I'm going to argue further
that the incredible diversity
and profundity of the anciently conserved ecologies of earth
actually provide a local
an array of local amplification lenses
that the ancients were adept at understanding
participating in intimate
meaningful relation with
and operationalizing
in order to deal
in order to both make discoveries
and also
to
enact medicine
to have clairvoyance
clairaudience
clairsentience
all of these things
these are natural to humans the same way swimming is natural to fish
probably for most of our history we were telepathic
because instead of having to wait
for a dream
or to go into trance
seven of those lenses were lit up in structuring consciousness
while we were awake
there was an array
of relational
of relationships in
the my arc and in the
actual living ecologies of earth and the living places
the mountains and so forth
that were so robust
that it was impossible to live or think
in terms of things
everything was beings
friends, relations, families, everything
the stones, everything, the sky, the cloud, the sun, everything
and I'm not
necessarily recommending that we return
we try to go back to this
we have changed
we are a different animal now
but we can go forward
and discover that there's something we can explore together
that is actually more
profound than if we had spaceships that could go to other
planets much more profound
because
there are layers of the my arc
that are accessible to human
consciousness, intention, intelligence
relationality, participation
that are, if you will
above distance
imagine for example
that there is a form of
feedback you can produce in consciousness
that takes you to a position from which
all moments, minds, persons, places
and situations
are with you
there's no distance between you and them
they are your body, now
from that position you can begin
to form derivations over the manifold
that are naturally transcendent
they are not merely intelligent
in fact
they are morally and ethically superior
to anything that can be done with concepts
because
from that position
it is impossible to defect from communion
you can't do it through ignorance
you will have no desire to
in a sense this is what
is proposed by moral and ethical perfection
it's not perfect behavior
it's relational integrity
naturally resultant
from unification of the layers
in consciousness
so what was I saying
I talked about the mountains
I just want to close that thread
so with JK
I talked about what happened to me at Machasta
and much more happened there
but it was very profound for me
even though I was in my ordinary
waking consciousness or so I thought
and I didn't realize what
the old Navajo man
was doing with his song
and I was respectful
but I didn't yet understand what that song is for
or even
yes there are many things I did not understand
and there are many things I do not understand
even my speculations today
these are new nascent
experimental
derivations of what I have
I have become aware of
in my life experience and thought
and relation with the Mayark
so when I was talking about the mountains
I said you know it's very powerful
the world is different near the mountains
it doesn't seem accidental that the humans
in many of their stories
come to the mountains
to have congress with the gods
not an accident
this is not superstition
literally what you're talking about
look at what the moderns do
the moderns make skyscrapers
they're too dumb to make pyramids
or large spheres or domes
those two things should go together
pillars and spheres
because what you don't want to do
is produce something penetrative
without producing something receptive nearby
and so the humans
the moderns they make skyscrapers
and what do they put on top of them
lightning rods and so forth
I don't know the actual functional history
of that process or whether it is still done
but it was common for a long time
to draw the lightning to ground
perhaps
so you can see
the relationship between lightning
and mountains in the story
you can also see
the relationship between
stories about gods
and meeting the gods
and the mountains
it is not the only place it happens
but what you actually have is a place
where the earth rises up
and becomes much closer
to what is beyond the earth
beyond the sky
time space itself
and all that it is
filled with
its histories, its families
all of these things
so you get a point on the surface of the earth
that is vastly closer to earth's membrane
and from there
it travels a lot easier
to put it mildly
and so is
you'll meet
eventually
spend enough time there you will realize
that the lowlands are not the same planet
in a sense
yes the same planet but
not the same world
so when the Egyptians were building the pyramids
Aztecs or other people were building
South American pyramids
or pyramids in other places
there was something going on
about relation with the sky
and thus I would argue the Mayarch
not time space, they didn't have that model
but they probably had traveled in the Mayarch
and I will argue that there is evidence for this
some trivial evidence
in a sense, relatively trivial
is that one of the Blackfoot heroes
Scarface
comes down from the sky
with his mother
they get in trouble
for something in the sky, his mom gets in trouble
and they are going to cast her down to earth
so to speak
she has a young male baby
and
Spider-Man
who is
Orion in this case
in a sense Orion is his web
part of his web perhaps
he lowers a strand to the earth so that
she and her child don't just fall
and her child
acquires a terrible scar
from being burned
by the fiber of the web
on his face
and
in Blackfoot tradition
as it was shared with me
by Orion First Diver
this is where I know, this is where my
very poor knowledge of such matters comes from
in this case
this man becomes kind of a hero
but also a bit of a troublemaker
he has an incredible adventure
a romantic adventure
he goes to visit the sun's lodge
on a quest
he acquires some medicine there
and also his
by doing the sun a favor
he earns a boon
boons from divine beings are often extremely dangerous for humans
if they indeed are humans
a fundamental question here
the sun
the sun removes the scar from his face
English translation
of his name
which I cannot recall
the Blackfoot word for at the moment
but the English translation is Scarface
and when he dies
he
returns to the sky
and becomes Jupiter
it should be blatantly obvious
that either
this name is entirely accidental
it is nothing but coincidence
the Blackfoot people did not know
that Jupiter has a great big scar
on its face
or they did
and
people who believe in physicalism
materialism
that everything is knowable, that is mechanical
that knowledge is actually true knowledge
is knowledge of mechanics
and dead matter
accidentally forming organisms and so forth
these people will
have no way to understand
that the ancient
peoples had traveled in the Mayarch
this did not require spaceships
they were capable of forming the vehicles
for such travel
individually and together
this is a natural feature of the Mayarch
that is so much more profound
local to earth
that it's almost as if you were born
on the paradise of waters
you were born in the land of the many waters
and
all of the waters were obscured
by language and commerce
and interaction and technology and modernity
and concepts
so that your experience of that planet
was one of many deserts
this is the great tragedy
of the children who are born today
in places where the old traditions
have been snuffed
converted or extracted
or worse represented
symbols
now look, symbols
in a sense they are like the pyramids
right they are
consider the metaphor of the many flowering
being earlier in the talk
that is a symbolic
metaphor
and it's extremely rich and the symbols
are like the pyramids in the sense that they are not
they don't have single purposes
they're not one-use tools
so when I was talking to my friend
I told him the biosphere
is a library of travelling ways
and the humans are
one of the forms here
most profoundly
endowed
with all of the different ways
of producing
heroic prodigy
from
travel in the mayark
and the formation of relationships
in the living world and the mayark
and the living world is
from this perspective
a beautifully complete reflection of all of the different
features of the mayark all of their features can be found here
and most of them look like
organisms and relationships
behaviours
forms of participation
methods of structuring
conscious awareness
or in some cases unstructuring it
so that it's natural
so that the library of its natural forms
arises directly in experience without
the necessity of being
intentionally manipulated
and so forth
wow
I had no idea
that I would be
I've almost done something kind of impossible
which is
I used to have a neologism for this
there's certain things you can speak of
that are so profound
that the mere speaking of them begins to become
the inaction of them
and I strongly suspect
that what we refer to as
ceremony
as white folk or westerners
there was
there were far better terms for this
that were much more indicative
of what was actually going on
and I think what was going on
was that there are ways of singing
and dancing and remembering together
that naturally begin to produce
both
the vehicles
and their purposes
and I think
I've accidentally been doing that today
if I'm super lucky
I'm going to pause here because I'm coming to a place
of a lot of noise and I don't want to subject you to that
I shall return
okay I had to
I was about to talk about a problem
that happens when
it happens for me sometimes
when
when I'm really on fire
this has happened
very provocatively a few times in my life
I'm completely on fire
I'm doing the
Icarus thing
doing the Icarus game
my dad has given me
so to speak a toy
Daedalus my dad has given me a toy
and I'm
I'm traversing the ladder
going up the ladder sometimes too quickly
to pay attention to what's going on
and my goal is to create
something that others can use to climb with
but I also
don't want to just give them wings
the same way that
I don't want to give my infant
you know
to the ocean
or drop it from a mountaintop or something
because
there's all kinds of
confusing problems and dangers
that
if I were able to just directly give them wings
this would be
trouble this would bode ill
so
anyway often
the artifact is destroyed
on
my phone a few times
recordings have failed to save
so what I did a moment ago was just
take the time to allow the recording
to completely be digitized
and then
begin again
and I was about to talk about
well one of the things I was talking about previously was
the
peculiar ability
I think I can demonstrate it actually
and I've done this before
apologies for the
noise for here
I'll pause
for a moment
alright
so
if I say
this is one of the best examples I can come up with easily
I used to have better ones
but I cannot remember them for I had no one to discuss them with
and over time they faded
but this is part of why I make these recordings
because I have to practice what I've
learned or it fades
and I also have to have somehow some way to
apply it or it fades
mere discussion isn't enough
it has to somehow be enacted
a lot of speaking that enacted
I'll try to give you an example
if you imagine that consciousness is a bubble of many bubbles
what we do when we produce language or speak or write
is we form
sequences
of
collapses of that manifold
into words and that is what I am doing
to produce the language that you are hearing from my voice
on the recording
so I've described
a fundamental principle
that is a perspective
on how I am describing anything
in a sense I've encoded
a foundational feature
of my enacted behavior
in language
so that it becomes visible to consciousness
and can be referred to
and when one is doing this
it is a kind of magical thing
and this is what the rapsodes do
those who emotionally captivate
and manipulate
us
the comedians
and the
those who tell us
the story tellers, the movie makers, the actors, the actresses
and also in a sense
the little children
with the little children
often are very different
from the adults
in that
it is more likely for them
to be doing it unselfconsciously
although that's a very complex statement
that I can imagine refutations of
so when I'm really lucky
I manage to
go beyond what I've seen before
using principles of what I've seen before
and I would argue that
we are indeed here to go
and
the direction
is in a sense
in the castanetian tradition
they have a privileged use of the word infinity
I would prefer to substitute
the word my arc for what they mean
but one of their beliefs
apparently
is that at death
it is possible to sidestep
the entire process
that ordinarily obtains
and effectively travel the my arc
without limitation
without inhibition
so we have traversed
vastly richer
terrain than I had initially imagined
I'm very grateful
to all of you
my travelling companions
it is a privilege and an honour
for me to learn together with
and for
all of you
and the history and future of life
on our world
and the hope of deeper awareness
and understandings and the recovery
of our innate potentials
for prodigy as human beings
on a world largely
estranged from it
and furiously manufacturing
replicas
of features
of its appearance
thank you for joining me
I wish you beautiful ways
and lives, relations and opportunities as always
may you find
that medicine, those medicines
that most restore
encourage, reassure
and empower you with their potencies
thank you for joining me
I look forward to doing this again together very soon
bye bye for now
