I'm often walking around this lake in the afternoon and when you walk anywhere you get
a sense over time of the others who walk there regularly and if you're tracking that at all
in consciousness we get a sort of a traumatic persona right you get a cast
members and the characters and there are a lot of characters here in San Francisco
not so many of the old kind that were sort of super famous in their way but
just the understated just kind of live in their lives kind and there's this guy who walks by me a
lot he's got a little dodge and he's you know he's a physically big man he's older kind of a low
profile you wouldn't you know funny thing is you look at people and you think you have some
idea like what's inside there right you have no fucking idea I got to tell you that guy could be a
particle physicist right you could be an angel he could be anybody right we have we have no
idea and you can't get a good read from just looking at the outside though you might be able
to get a little bit of data the problem there is that you have nothing to test your theories
against at all nothing right so you have no idea if your intuitions you know are good or not and
some people are like well I can kind of get the feeling of the person's energy or you know I can
kind of sense their soul or whatever right okay maybe but I'd like to see you test that out right
somehow and see how often you're confused it's very difficult to not be taken in by the superficial
evaluatively right taken in by the superficial what shapes and the character of the costume but
let's be really clear smart costumes hide you from predators they also hide you from people you
don't want to really relate with so a good costume makes you appear as like mr. or mrs. nobody
right you don't stand out at all and a lot of the most amazing people have really deadpan
costumes right there's like you see nothing and you won't see nothing unless you get close to them
because the way because of the way our relational aspects are kind of layered from you know public
to local public to intimate public people you see occasionally to you know associations acquaintances
friends best friends you know blood friends family and on and on and on down to this is something
I've only told one person in my life and even this is something I've never told anyone including
maybe there's there's a layer where I haven't told myself right so there's there's all these layers
and the costumes help to keep them coherently structured organized functional and sometimes
updated if we're you know if we're developmentally doing stuff so funny because I had no intention
of making this complex recording there's this guy he walks by I see him a lot older guy big guy
nondescript and he's got this little doctrine that walks almost precisely I don't know eight steps
in front of him and I swear they are the same fucking soul in two bodies when I look at that dog
the way it looks at me it's as if it's looking at me for the man it's as if the man has a dog satellite
that is you know right just like checking everything out so that he doesn't have to you know
and there's a lot to this idea in general um
as regards dogs differently as regards cats differently as regards birds and other animals
I mean you can have satellites that are not that are weirdly not human you can have satellites that
are beehives or praying mantises or mice or you know earthworms I mean all of the intelligences
are intelligent they just don't necessarily uh look that way oh I see a problem I'm gonna have to solve
so hey you may think you can tell what's strange what's going on underneath the costume good luck
unless you get a taste of it you know if you get to check it if you're like a secret agent or
something you go around um what uh it's the right word like profiling people and then manipulating
them okay you're gonna get a sense after a while but if you have nothing to test your theories
against the chances that your theories are good are very low even and we all go around thinking
no wait I'm but I'm Mr. Intuitive okay great let's show me some functional right data because
everyone thinks they're Mr. Intuitive so it's a huge problem um is that
yeah it's it's a really weird problem
um
if we don't get any tests we're it's mostly probably just hubris right uh
and also the specific hubris of the untested man I can ride bikes upside down in the air
you know having never ridden a bicycle then you get on a bike you realize oh wait a minute
so yeah we don't it's really tough for us to
test our intuitions we don't often get a good idea from the superficial stuff the superficial
stuff is very misleading um beauty and depth you know are at best strange bedfellows uh there's
some that happens but a lot of the time like beauty or wealth any kind of uh strong relational privilege
something that privileges you and makes you seem desirable to many others in relation that stuff
super dangerous it can work out okay with some of us but a lot of the time it just leads to
crazy miss or failed development
and then you know sometimes you see people in their animals and we've got these tropes about
this right like the dog the person and the dogs start to look like each other it's so much
weirder than that it's almost like in many cases it's the same soul in two bodies and this is
something you know that's true about other relationships we have we can have this kind
of a relationship with place with other people with other like we can have we can be parented by
other people in a very profound way that is truly filial and we can you know um be adopt other other
people as our sort of alloy children in a way that's very powerful as well we have all these
capacities we just attend to only get expressed in very specialized contexts which is unfortunate for
us um because we would have much more common and deep experience of them if we establish context in
which we can um play and learn and grow this way which is of course what i hope we will do
