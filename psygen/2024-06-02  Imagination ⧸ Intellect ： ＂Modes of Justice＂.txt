Hello, everybody. Welcome. It is Saturday, 1st of June, 2024.
The year when schizogenic insanity was normalized, when understanding became its opposite.
Where ignorance, you know, the polarity of object-opinionated ignorance and the light of the origins of intelligence and insight flipped over.
So that the former took the throne of the latter in our cultures and consciousness and thought and language, as I've been seeing many examples of today.
And yet, there are bastions of insight and awareness, learning, discovery, growth, self-correction.
Amen. And the mutual encompassment of inquiry. Amen.
Amin Hillman recently said something so right. He's like, you're not going to believe me, bro, but this word history, it comes from a Greek root that means asking a question of an oracle.
An oracle. The living spirit of insight, divine wisdom embodied in a young woman in ancient Greece.
An oracle. History was a question, not a declaration, not a record of the authorized version
of what had been a dream.
I was listening this morning to messages
from my friend Tim Sanderson, brilliantly embodied, soulful, heartful, more than human being.
His voice is so soft.
And, you know, he complains that
he was never really an intellectual,
never truly an academic,
but was lost instead
in the reveries
of his fervent
imaginings.
And I was like, the whole, you know,
I don't know, 78%
of the amphitheater of my
ancestors stood up in their graves.
I'm like, yes!
Wild cheering ensued.
Though, you know,
both paths
the intellect is profound
when it's funded
by its origins,
when it reveres its origins
in dreaming and emotion
and passion.
And part of that passion
is the quest.
She was pretty good
in the car just
because she's done it so much.
The quest for
the superposition
above the concept
of justice
if the concept
of justice
justice means
or is taken to mean
is
clumsily and crudely
taken to mean
a kind of accounting
where transgressors
must be called
to task
and made to pay
because apparently
wrongdoing
is a banking system.
Right?
This sort of insanity,
this branch
on the upside-down
burning tree
of ignorance
flagrantly masquerading
as propriety,
purity
is perennially horrifying.
We see the results today
in
specific conflicts
I will not hear
name.
We see this
reenacted,
devastating,
nonsense
masquerading
as justification
wherever that may happen.
And it happens in me.
I'm familiar
with the stink of this,
the fingerprint,
the poisoned,
yeah,
the poisoned fingerprint
of my own thumb
at the beginning
of some crime scene
where I decide
vengeance
will be mine.
Retribution
will be the spirit
of the day.
You know?
And
it's not that there's
no place for that.
Rather,
its place should be rare
at best,
at most.
and
funded by
brilliant insight,
not regimented
ignorance
structured into
rules and laws
and things.
You know,
the quest
is for understanding
exceptionally
profuse
throat clearing,
apparently,
honking
in the intersection,
right?
And
throwing the children
off the bridge
into the river
to teach them
to swim.
just had to get
the little ones
in there
because,
you know,
apparently
everyone forgets
they're alive
or pretends
that something else
is going on.
Not everyone,
but
the collectives,
definitely.
Just like,
children?
Who cares?
Boom!
Guns!
Blow it up!
destroy those mothers
for the sake
of some
declaration.
Obliterate them,
blood and gore,
fields of broken bones,
chaos.
All right?
Yeah,
if that's the mark
of sanity
or intelligence
among the humans,
then get me
off this planet,
please.
Which,
you know,
for many sensitive
and intelligent children
is the slogan
they'd wear
on their T-shirt.
How could I have
been born
on a planet
where the humans
treat each other
like a lawn
that just needs
a good mowing?
And yet,
at the same time,
there's clearly
some truth
behind
that delusion.
The idea
of harrowing
that we find
in certain
misconstrued
biblical texts
is nonetheless
important.
We do actually
not eat
the chafe
of the wheat.
We eat
the tender seed
inside it
and are thus
nourished
and our generations
are rejuvenated
by the magic
they're in.
Meanwhile,
the highly sensitive
person sees
the box of cream
of wheat
as scream of wheat.
The screaming
of the plants
as they're
sighted
in the fields.
Back when we
used to actually
have to manually
harvest food
or grain.
Meanwhile,
these people
are feeding
ducks bread,
which,
you know,
maybe I'm
misunderstanding
something here.
Pretty sure
that those
straight-up carbs
are poison
to waterfowl,
but these
are city
waterfowl,
so who knows.
And why
should I trust
my own
biases and
judgments?
The world
is complicated.
It's like a
million spiderwebs
intersecting
and you try
to what?
Determine the
value
of the
intersections
via some
combination
of emotional
valence
and rational
thought.
Okay.
Hopefully,
the emotional
valence
is actually
there
and veritable
and not just
the result
of doubling
down on
previous
biases
and resentments
and triggerings
and so forth.
the dopamine
ratchet,
right?
The neurochemical
ratcheting
that we
undergo
via media
and spectacle,
Facebook,
Twitter.
I mean,
what a more
ironic,
you know,
the collective
mangling
of intelligence
of many
twits.
A crowd
of twits.
Of course,
there are
brilliant voices
in the
morass.
There are
those of us
who,
well,
I counted
myself among
them.
Did you see
what I did
there?
There are
those of us
who,
courageously
and steadfastly
hold the
line
in the
cataclysm
of ignorance
and opinionation
we call
social media
today.
I'm actually
trying to
understand
and one
of the
things that
became clear
to me
when I
listened to
the dulcet
tones of
my friend
Tim this
morning
was just
how he
doesn't stray
from his
embodiment
when he
speaks.
And when
he says,
I couldn't
appreciate it
and sort
of,
he doesn't
say,
I'm putting
words in
his mouth,
but he
meant something
that resembles
I revered
beautiful
examples of
intellectualism
in academia,
but I
couldn't,
I'm not a
library of
Alexandria.
I'm a
dreamer.
and what's
so beautiful
about that
that comes
to mind
for me
that I
take from
it is a
couple of
things right
away,
a couple of
things
immediately.
And the
first is that
the origin of
the possibility
of memory
and intelligence
lies in
dreaming.
Dreaming,
it is the
the activity
of angels
in our
minds
that tend
the gardens
of memory
so that
they
flourish
and thrive
and blossom
and fruit.
That
imagination
he speaks
of is
primordially
fundamental
and there's
no such
thing as
intellect
without it
so what
he's really
saying is
in my
view is
I
revere
the
primordial
origins
from which
the
possibilities
of intellect
spring.
I remain
true to
these.
I adore
these.
I belong
to these.
To them.
To their
spirit
to their
action
to their
bodies
I am
theirs
they are
mine
we are
one
and that's
profound
and beautiful
I agree
I contrasted
myself
I was
like
after singing
the praises
of his
failure
to
dissociate
into his
intellect
I talked
about
my own
weaknesses
of such
of such
a form
where
my intellect
is like
a UFO
and I
wake up
in the
morning
and it's
glowing
there in
the center
of the
room
and I
trace the
sigils
on the
unbroken
surface
of this
egg
shaped
sphere
a door
appears
with
blinding
light
surrounding
it
it
becomes a
portal
I step
in
and
boom
I'm
out of
my body
I'm
in
wild
transcendental
dissociative
ecstasies
far above
my
mundane
soma
right
my flesh
my nervous
system
my bones
my organs
and they're
like
wait
what just
happened
here
Darren
Darren
is
he's
already
dead
because
that's
sort of
what's
going
on
I'm
I'm
in a
way
I'm
transported
I'm
in the
spirit
world
before
my
passing
I'm
seeing
from
after
my
death
back
into
my
life
and
it
doesn't
require
drugs
it
just
requires
ideas
and
language
and my
passionate
fascination
with both
my
adoration
of their
mystery
and horror
and splendor
and potential
in a way
I long
ago
and without
really the use
of drugs
in fact
in the most
sober
epochs
of my
life
as a
young
adult
and in
my
thirties
I knew
the kisses
of the
muses
and
I didn't
know what
to call
it
because
this is
the true
state
of blissful
naivete
day
where
you haven't
been
separated
from it
it hasn't
been taken
from you
so you
have no
way
to refer
to it
because there's
no need
to refer
to it
it's not
separate
right
the reference
comes after
the divorce
after the
abstraction
after the
loss
after the
fall
I mean
any of us
who have
sought
wisdom
oh my
God
what an
ironic
what an
ironic
situation
we will
find ourselves
in
any of us
who have
sought
wisdom
and tasted
of the
nectars
of her
mouth
philo
so
kissing
kissing
that saliva
the
the
the
trophallaxis
which is
the transmission
of hormones
and nutrients
among
hybenoptera
the ants
the bees
the wasps
often
between
species
not often
sometimes
sometimes
ants
and wasps
may
exchange
trophilactic
nectars
and
they
call them
there's no
word
in English
they are
transigenic
they come
before
the generation
of minds
they're
primordial
these
nectars
elixirs
filters
phil
trs
i think
though sometimes
spelled
ers
yeah i was
i was having
congress
with the
muses
before i
understood
they existed
formally
before i knew
how to speak
of it
and they
and they
were
reforging
my mind
and my
dreaming
resurrecting
them
moment to
moment
in my
waking
life
in my
creative life
in my
writing
and my
creative
play
my music
literally
music
my
quests
and so
you know
i learned
to kind
of look
down on
ceremonial
magic
because
there's
feral
enchantments
that seem
to me
to far
exceed
the
possibilities
of
structured
representation
ritual
and so
forth
and when
you have
those
why
you would
never
trade
them
for
the bones
of the
thing
but these
days that
magic is
much more
rare
than it
was in
my youth
and so
i know
intimately
the
body
and wings
of my
intellect
and
i will
gladly
depart the
graveyard of
my waking
mind
for the
skies
beyond
it
though i
only
fairly
recently
came to
understand
i was
doing
this
it was
so
natural
my
trepidation
of
incarnate
existence
and
somato
emotional
historicity
yeah like
a layered
archaea
right
a layered
archaea
of my
confusions
losses
injuries
sufferings
subjugations
enslavements
all
um
inflected
inflected
with by
with and
by the
peculiarly
weird
perspective
from outside
the personal
the um
the bizarre
perspective
that generates
some of
the branches
on the
trees
of psychosis
paranoia
um
self-criticism
this uh
the possibility
of
social
critique
of public
critique
of how
others might
have seen
me
of how
the others
of myself
might direct
the cruel
illuminations
of critical
judgment
right
and this
is part
of why
I say
um
that is
not now
and never
shall be
justice
uh
condemnation
and justice
have nearly
nothing in
common
for justice
it seems
to me
must be
the
the
the
now I'm
going to
get in
trouble here
because I'm
going to
make
structured
language
about
something
that has
to be
fluidly
transcendent
in its
natures
and in
actions
it must
have a
body
that isn't
conceptual
that isn't
linguistic
all right
but I'll
dare
I mean
it's the
first part
of my
name
right
dare
in
don't get
named
this
if you
want to
get born
as a
human
don't
go
here
I was
actually
named
for Bobby
Darren
a singer
one of
melodious
voice
and when
I was
little I
used to
sing all
the time
and my
parents would
constantly
try to
make me
stop but
I was
actually
fairly good
at it
these days
I'm older
and unpracticed
but I
would love
I used to
sing in a
choir
singing is
really
it's so
funny
out
choir
in any
case
where I'm
going here
is that
actual
justice
uses the
problems
that emerge
in what we
might think
of as
criminal
behavior
that we
would hold
some
individual
to account
for
okay
wow
now
there's
sort of
at least
two different
meanings of
account here
one is
to explain
to us
help us
understand
your
motivations
that's one
kind of
an account
but the
other kind
is
we will
debit
you
we will
debit
your life
we will
we will
subtract
from you
relationships
time
freedom
as if
what we
have in
our modern
societies
even slightly
resembles
freedom
but it
does
compare to
being in
a you
know
a stone
box
see how
this
debiting
this
accounting
which is
oh my god
the very
absence of
humanity
intelligence
insight
awareness
justice
truth
the virtues
it is
the
a
catastrophic
abeyance
of virtue
and
understanding
so as I've
said many
times before
what we
ache for
when
injustice
has taken
place
it's not
punishment
we ache
for the
subtraction
from the
world
of the
forces
ideas
and
situations
the traps
that led
what we
call the
perpetrator
to enact
the
quote
crime
unquote
and
we've been
confused
to desire
further
poison
we've been
poisoned
the poison
killed our
heart
and now we
want to make
more poison
and poison
a million
hearts
poison the
future
poison
history
just lay
waste
to the
origins of
our humanity
our souls
virtue
understanding
awareness
what we
really want
is
the context
to be
healed
so that
such crimes
become not
nearly
unnecessary
but
impossible
right
that's what
justice looks
like
it looks like
using the
intelligence
we can
derive
from the
perpetrator
as the
symptom
of something
wrong in
the water
of our
communal
identity
or failure
to establish
it
to sustain
it
truly
wow
these people
are making
floral
wreaths
I'm so
jealous
it's awesome
oh my god
what's the
uh
is this a
greek symbol
on the
blanket
sure looks
like it
wow
it's amazing
they're actually
being human
together
it's
fucking
awesome
I love
this
by the
way
you know
one form
of justice
is doesn't
concern itself
with history
at all
it concerns
itself with
re-beautifying
the present
in such a
way
that the
that the
integrity
and profound
beauty of the
future becomes
re-possibilized
right
resurrected
from its
you know
cascade
of falling
off
19 different
cliffs
of vengeful
stupidity
and ignorance
yeah
that's what
they're doing
up there
that's celebration
I don't know
the etymology
of the word
justice
or the word
crime
or perpetrator
or celebration
I understand
alphabetically
some things
about these
words
but I'm not
going to
descend
into that
labyrinth
at the
moment
rather I
will stay
in the
path
but what
those humans
up there
are doing
with their
laughter
and mutuality
and joyful
communality
and floral
you know
wreathing
each other's
literally
their heads
right
they're
wreathing
each other's
heads
with flowers
with flowers
think about
what this
actually means
all right
it's very
astonishing
because on the
one hand
they are
wreathing
their heads
with
magical
substances
comprised
over trillions
and trillions
of lifetimes
of
these
plants
without
which we
would not
exist
so
these
plants
are the
progenitors
in a
sense
the
fairies
are
the
fairies
and the
elves
are the
spirits
of these
plants
and their
relationships
and their
histories
with the
land
and the
mountains
and the
skies
and the
waters
okay
so they
are
wreathing
each
other's
heads
just for
a moment
in joyful
mutual
celebration
and promotion
right
they are
raising
each other
up
in the
light
of the
sun
on the
top
of the
strawberry
hill
in
San
Francisco
the
place
you know
named
after
Francis
of Assisi
who
probably
actually
was
amazingly
virtuous
and brilliant
and perhaps
even holy
human being
regardless
of you know
the fact
yeah
has nothing
to do
with the
fact
of
the
association
the
the
co
yeah
what
which cohorts
we would
associate him
with
and why
I mean
it could
have a little
to do
with it
but
yeah
it's
just
so
yeah
they're
up
there
wreathing
each
other's
heads
and drinking
wine
and celebrating
and laughing
and loving
each other
and being
human
together
wow
what a
healing
moment
and notice
that it's not
formal
it's not a
ritual
that they're
enacting
it's
spontaneous
it's
improvised
and you
know
it's
probably
someone's
birthday
or
maybe
someone
was
just
married
or
maybe
someone
had a
child
or maybe
they were
just like
hey you
know
it's
Saturday
it's
Saturn
it's
the day
of
Saturn
S
S T
R
right
Sigma
Tau
Rho
as
Amun
would say
Sigma
Tau
Rho
yeah
so beautiful
and inspiring
and evocative
of memory
they are
wreathing
each other's
foreheads
with flowers
and one of them
knows how to do this
in an expert way
they have
probably hemp
vines
or
strings
that are being
soaked
in a liquid
to make them
especially pliable
and they had
just baskets
of flowers
to weave
into the
vines
so brilliant
so one
one of the kinds
of justice
is that we go
forward
from here
in remembrance
of mutual
beauty
and origin
think about
that
no historical
damnations
indictments
because think about this
if you have to preserve
the history
of wrongdoing
as you walk forward
into life
and the potentials
of your more than merely
human life
if you have to preserve
all those indictments
and you know
equivocate over them
and punish them
and wow
the problem with that
is there are certain
kinds of burden
that get heavier
by a matter of
you know
geometric
expansion
right like
exponential
they get exponentially
heavier
each moment
that you continue
to preserve them
and
we don't notice this
because
the urge
to preserve them
is one of the lethal games
that's smuggled into
our consciousness
along with
the process
you know
during the processes
of in languaging
and enculturation
as children
we think that English
comes with no baggage
nothing like that
is even possibly true
the opposite is true
there are
you know
there are vast
warehouses
of lethal
lethal tropes
right
figures of speech
metaphor
simile
I was trying to think
of some
but I'm
I'm not
I'm not
dwelling in the
warehouses
at the moment
I'm dwelling
above them
so it's hard
for me to dip
down
and grab
exemplars
all kinds of
courtroom
mind
tropes
war
mind
tropes
vengeance
tropes
but just think
of how
metabolically
energetically
and spiritually
expensive it is
to preserve
harms
and some
and some
will say
well you
can't just
ignore them
okay
maybe
maybe
sometimes
but actually
you can do
this thing
that's
transcendentally
useful
which is not
to take offense
in the first place
and if you notice
you've taken
you've taken offense
you're going to have
to carry that
you sure you want
that
do you go to the
store ever
did you ever once
go to the mall
or the grocery store
and find the most
disgusting
heaviest thing
you could find
right
a box of rotten
dead rat corpses
or something
right
huge box
weighs like
three tons
and you carry that
thing home
and you drag it
along with you
for the rest of your
not once
ever did you do
this right
so why do we do
this psycho-emotionally
why do we decide
to take offense
it's the most
expensive thing
you could take
and it grows
catastrophically
more expensive
the longer
you preserve it
and I hear
you know
in the background
the voices
of those of us
who have suffered
actual
indignities
and catastrophic
harms
or rape
or you know
horrifying violence
or murder
I hear their voices
saying
what shall we
just forget it
no
but what are we
going to do
with it
what will we
make of it
the fact that
I got
the fact that
something that
happened to me
was horrifyingly
bad
I mean
recently something
happened that I
definitely took
offense to
a doctor
specifically
a doctor
at Ocean Park
Health Center
Chan
overtly denied
that an episode
in my medical
history ever
took place
this didn't
happen
I was like
first of all
who are you
again
it'd be like
someone saying
you know
that a mother
didn't give birth
to her child
or
that she never
had a child
or something
not that
my injury
is my child
I'm not trying
to make that
association
I'm just saying
that it actually
took place
that I was
treated for a
specific illness
by a specific
doctor at a
specific time
and she just
overtly said
nope
never happened
can't have happened
there's no such
diagnosis
blah blah blah
I found it
very offensive
I wrote her a
letter saying
you know
this is
alarming
your behavior
I'm not sure
that a doctor
I mean
you can see
why
you know
why I was
offended
but
in this
moment
as I'm
remembering
this
experience
which I
conceive of
as a
violation
right
the whole
of my
identity
begins to
collapse
into
something
that can
be
violated
is that
liberty
is that
virtue
is that
intelligence
is that
insight
is that
truth
why
would I
even take
the time
to take
offense
now
in some
cases
it's
reasonable
for us
to assert
what we
today
talk about
as boundaries
but if
this becomes
our fascination
woe
w-o-e
be unto
us
if
our
fascination
and our
obsession
becomes the
maintenance
of boundaries
in a
world
of real
and imagined
violations
our humanity
will collapse
into an
uninhabitable
skeleton
of
doubt
confusion
despair
right
we must
live
beyond
what happens
to us
and our
and our
possible
interpretations
and we
also must
speak up
when the
we know
when a
violation
is tangibly
real
and not
just imagined
or a
projection
but again
the obsession
with
I'm
I'm just
a magnet
for the
violation
of
you know
whatever
it may
be
isn't a
livable
identity
there's not
enough
there
inside
there
to dwell
in it
so I
certainly
recognize
the urge
in some
cases
for something
resembling
redress
of wrongdoing
but it's
a very
very
dangerous
balancing
game
and most
often in
modern society
that game
becomes
malignant
quickly
we have
the wrong
idea
we think
there are
individuals
there's all
kinds of
ridiculous
pre-existing
conditionality
that is
nonsensical
and is the
result of
the terrifying
reflections
of
isolation
right
which
could be
literally
understood
as meaning
I am
so late
I am
behind
time
time is
way ahead
of me
relation is
way ahead
of me
I am
alone
and my
cohort
is far
it's so
far ahead
of me
that I
don't
belong
to it
anymore
isolate
isolate
ion
that ion
means a
self
and also
a particle
and possibly
a particle
that transmits
or preserves
something
in the sense
that I am
here
highlighting
creatively
there is so
much for us
to learn
and recover
and celebrate
we should be
very careful
life is short
existence is
brief
we should make
it beautiful
together with
and for each
other in the
history and
future of life
and our
peoples
fundamentally
these are
one people
one
one family
that's all
there is
on this
tiny little
rock
this moist
rock
floating around
in time
space
this is our
home
this is our
body
these are
our people
there's no
other people
and the
idea of
the individual
as we
ridiculously
are tortured
by it
today
people are
like oh
he's a
fucking
communist
no
like
how many
of your
cells in
your body
are individuals
let me ask
you this
does it matter
matter at all
their individuality
if
wow
this is really
cool
does their
individuality matter
at all
if the body
dies
what are you
going to make
of their
individuality
then
it's funny the
photograph I've
just taken
will probably
become
the photo
I use
to
for this
recording
later
this idea of
individuals and
their rights
is
exemplary of
the loss
of communal
of the context
of the meaningful
context
of our humanity
over time
as
as we
as our
context
became
abstract
representational
commercial
domineering
viral
frisbee
falsifications
of the possibility
of communal
meaningful communal
experience
roles
identity
behavior
so one of the
things I saw
up on top
of the mountain
or the little
hill
strawberry
hill
was a
reenaction
of that
possibility
however brief
and ephemeral
not even
more powerful
right
for all of
its brevity
even more
powerful for
its inability
to fundamentally
change
right
it's like
it's one
droplet
in an
ocean
but that
droplet
shines
so brightly
that the
entire
ocean
is
transformed
in its
spirit
if not
its
physical
activity
right
and so
those droplets
matter
that's
that's what
I call
real
and it's
easy to
forget this
because
you know
we look
in our
modernity
and we
see
you know
a trillion
I'm going to
stop saying
my
pause phrase
we see
a trillion
violations
I'll just
pick one
microplastics
trillion
violations
per second
what can
we do
is there
even a
we
to do
things
no
there isn't
and if we
form a
we
to do
things
it's going
to be like
attempting to
eat the
moon
or swallow
the ocean
won't it
and so
it seems
that the
possibility
of enacting
change
is pre
prohibited
there's no
real way
and a
number of
my friends
have spoken
to me
about this
I'll mention
particularly
Sean
who is
working
with
pause
AI
and expressed
his despair
what can
we do
we can't
stop it
and I
explained to
him the
principle
that I
was orbiting
here
which is
that
when we
live
beautiful
lives
and we
witness
and speak
together
for each
other
for the
history
and future
of life
on our
world
and of
beings
of all
beings
when this
is done
with authenticity
and passion
and love
that always
matters
it's
not
necessarily
that the
gods
that the
victors
in a
situation
are favored
of the
gods
as we
might
imagine
and there's
something
above the
gods
above
the gods
there's
something
beyond
the gods
that even
they must
obey
and this
is the
principle
for which
they executed
Socrates
that he
dared
they accused
him
of atheism
because he
said
something
resembling
that even
the gods
must obey
the spirit
of truth
even the
gods
are subject
to this
and this
was the
the spear
point
they used
for his
indictment
and prosecution
he was
an oracle
he was
a male
oracle
but instead
of declaring
wisdom
he fomented
it
he fermented
it
among the
people
he would
bring them
together
in the
quora
and ferment
the nectar
of wisdom
from within
their hearts
and spirits
and this
made him
lethal
to the
fictions
that then
ruled
Athens
the warmongers
the weapon
makers
Plato's
parents
Plato's
father
his
brothers
his
family
we should
take these
matters
gravely
with grave
seriousness
and attend
them carefully
the possibilities
of the
spirit of
democracy
the spirits
from which
democracy
originated
those
possibilities
still exist
today
unenacted
overlooked
falsified
counterfeited
and democracy
doesn't just
mean the voting
of idiots
it's not the idea
at all
it's
I don't actually
know what it is
but I can say
how I conceive
of it
which is the
communal
preservation
and purification
of the context
of our
relationships
such that it
becomes possible
to not merely
know what is true
and good
and do that
but also to
avoid
what is lethal
and malignant
and destroys
history in the
future
and falsifies it
and counterfeits it
and sells us the
remains of it
at ever increasing
prices
destroying the
mothers and the
children and the
fathers and the
ancestors and the
progeny
that must be
avoided
so these are my
thoughts for the
day
I'm grateful to
have this opportunity
to speak them and
share them with you
I hope you find them
inspiring
and that you
are inspired enough
to
become historical
perhaps to learn
the ancient
Greek
and other
ancient languages
but particularly
the Greek
and to ask
questions of the
oracles
to ask the
imperative
questions that
you brought
to your human
incarnation
and your
more than
human existence
your more than
merely human
existence
that is precious
and noble
in its essence
that is beautiful
in its origin
and transcendental
in its natures
may your paths
and relations
questions
and dreams
be blessed
bye bye for now
thank you
