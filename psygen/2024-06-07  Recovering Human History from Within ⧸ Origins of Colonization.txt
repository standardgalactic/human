Hello, everybody. Welcome.
I'm very grateful to all of you who pay attention to my posts,
and especially those of you who like or share them.
And particularly my patrons, few though they are.
You make a lot of light in my life and help me to have the freedom to keep doing this work,
this joyful creativity, these explorations.
So I'm really grateful, particularly to my longtime supporter, H, and my new supporter, C.
And, you know, if you have a little something that you can spare each month,
one, two bucks, it's fine, whatever you've got.
So that'll help me keep producing this content and keeping it real on the Internet.
Circa 2024.
My motto for this year is that 2024 isn't a year.
The last year we will ever have as human beings around here for the foreseeable future was 2023.
2023. And this dumpster fire of insanity that we are presently experiencing is actually not a year at all.
In fact, and, you know, your mileage may vary.
I'm pretty sure that things aren't things anymore.
All that stuff we used to think we knew what that was or what was going on or what would happen next or who was who or all of that knowledge thing and knowing stuff, that's all gone.
Poof.
A mushroom cloud of over the horizon of identity.
And in some ways, that's wonderful.
Because a lot of the whatness and the isness and all that was broken.
But in other ways, we don't have any kind of ship that we can ride in together because we really never forged a we in the first place, except on very small scales.
And we didn't go around building ships either.
And, you know, by that, I just mean a trustworthy vehicle of purposive orientation together.
Almost all of the potentials of our communal relationships and behavior has been thoroughly, recursively recolonized.
By the thrisp-like, dead inside, infinitely hungry processes that establish themselves in the human cognitium, the network of human minds.
And if we don't do the necessary bonding, if we don't do the necessary engineering of our relationships with history, the sky, nature,
the living places, the plants, animals, and insects, the ancestors, are dreaming.
And what I will loosely refer to as the angels, the non-human intelligences, the accessible non-human intelligences above the human cognitium.
That have been lost to us, lost to our direct contact and experience for so long.
Even though most of us probably were born with these relationships intact.
And they may have stayed intact briefly during the earliest phases of our human incarnation, childhood, infancy and stuff.
But that stuff gets, well, what does it get?
It rarely survives, it poorly survives the processes of enlanguaging and enculturation.
Which our parents and peers impose on us, believing that to be some wonderful inheritance.
And the problem there is that it could be.
If it were rich, and veritable, and ancient, and true,
the processes of enlanguaging and enculturation would not be so violent,
so dissociative, malignly dissociative,
so isolating,
so terrifying,
so confusing.
But unfortunately, us moderns,
with very few exceptions,
I mean, the world,
let's be clear about something.
When I make very general statements about the humans,
I'm making a bad mistake.
And it's one that I've pointed out many times.
I am making a mistake I would call generalizing the worst common denominator over the manifold.
So the manifold is all the different living places and humans presently alive on Earth.
And the generalization is that they're all modern.
Well, a lot of the cohorts we might explore or contact or come into actual relationship with rather than just thinking about them.
And this is the problem with abstract thought.
We can dissociatively pretend to be in relationships we don't have.
And then from there we can evaluate the resulting abstractions and this obliterates our intelligence, right?
It's like a snuff film of the possibilities of actual, actually understanding or relating with.
The children, the children, the children are painting and their paintings are amazing.
So beautiful and colorful.
And see, in those little children, all of this worst common denominator stuff is not yet established.
They are still alive inside.
And there are many exceptions, beautiful exceptions, to this worst common denominator evaluative behavior, misbehavior,
that I'm concerned about.
And we should celebrate and recognize the exceptions.
Yes, the bell curve.
Yes, the averages.
And yes, they're devastating because their defection, the capacity to defect from our humanity,
to colonize and re-colonize, to devastate, to...
I'm looking for a neologism here.
It means to cause, to viciously impose forgetting, to anamnese, or no, to amnese, to...
It's funny.
It's funny.
It's funny.
It's funny.
It's funny.
The terrible weapons of colonization.
And this word gets, you know, overused these days for all kinds of things.
But what I'm talking about is when the possibility of human, of coherent human relation, intelligence, conservation of ancestral land, places, living places.
Intimate symbiosis of humans with the earth and the waters and the sky, which rarely approaches perfection, but in many places actually became coherent and beautiful and was sustained over time.
And colonization is sort of, I remember a bad cartoon maybe from the early 80s called Godzilla Meets Bambi.
And there's just, you know, you see Bambi's hanging out and then suddenly, boom, there's a footprint and then Bambi's smushed in the bottom of that footprint.
And that's, you know, that's a cartoonish image.
But the forces of colonization rose in peoples, in cohorts, in societies, in nations that were self-colonizing.
And this is part of the problem that is overlooked when we blame history on bad people.
And particularly when we take the convenient exit door and think, oh, yeah, it's patriarchy.
It's those males dominating things and slapping them with their generative organ, crushing them.
And while that's not untrue, the secret origins of these problems are preserved against our discovery when we make convenient indictments.
Because if we want to understand how it might be possible for us in our children's time to establish actually coherent, intelligent human societies worthy of survival,
never mind capable of self-sustainment, but virtuously beautiful in spirit and purpose and behavior,
then we're going to need a much better array of toys, array of perspectival toys with which to examine what led to the problems we face today.
And, you know, the common, the common figurines that we like to, excuse me,
that are often selected for admonition and indictments and elevation in our awareness to the status of culprits
are monotheism, patriarchy, commerce, commodity commerce,
class, hierarchical class, dichotomies,
class, hierarchical class, dichotomies,
the 1%, the wealthy,
the kings and queens,
particularly in various phases of the development of Europe and the Middle East.
I don't know, you know, personally I'm not well educated enough historically to understand the real birthplaces of,
the colonizing virus.
I love the, I love the cadences of German.
It's wonderful to hear people enthusiastically speaking German,
I love the cadences of German.
It's wonderful to hear people enthusiastically speaking German
as they walk past me.
And, you know, we might think, oh, what synchronicity?
Nazism, colonization.
Yeah, go ahead, think what you like.
But try to understand that what I'm saying is
we don't have the formula yet.
That stuff we're exchanging around
like a new kind of poison
in the atmosphere of what we have ironically called social justice
is not the elixir.
Nor is it the intoxicant that will give us insight.
If we want insight,
we're going to have to authentically go back
not merely into the history of our species,
but very carefully into the history of our own lives.
Your life, my life, our childhood,
the transitions,
the phases of colonization
that we ourselves underwent
as little children,
that our parents underwent,
that our grandparents underwent,
because I would like you to
suspect with me
that not only
is the key to the cage hidden,
you know,
the keys to the cages,
not only is it hidden
in our,
in the arc
of our developmental experience,
individually and collectively,
uniquely,
keys in each one of us
have been secreted,
secreted,
obscured,
occulted,
but something even stranger
is real
and accessible to us,
which is that
through a process
of,
that resembles something
we don't have a good word for,
and I'm
disinclined to forge
a convenient
neologism here,
because I want a really good one,
so I'll describe
instead of label,
in the same way that
geologists
look at the strata,
the layers,
in places where
they have been laid bare
to our access
on the land,
the only
really good example
I have
at hand,
easily accessible,
is the Grand Canyon,
a place where
a furrow
has been dug
by a river
into
the physical
body of
geologic time,
and so the strata
are laid bare,
and I guess the other
more destructive,
and
I think confusing
way to
try to get
at this information,
or these
recordings,
if you will,
these memories,
is with
core samples.
You carefully
drill
a tube,
you extract
tubes of
earth,
and stone,
and ice,
and stuff,
in a sequence
going down,
and then you
can lay them out
in a linear fashion,
and examine
the record,
but what I'm trying
to say,
what I'm implying
here is that,
and similarly,
with the
origin of life
branch of sciences,
paleontology,
where we look
in the various
strata for
quote,
evidence,
which I think is,
I'd love to know
the etymology
of this word
right now,
we look for
evidence of the
previously existing
phases of life
and development
that we imagine
took place
linearly,
because we
are
addicted to
one thing,
mind,
we are addicted
to linear
perspectives.
We don't have
to be,
we can break
out of that,
it's one of the
things we need
to,
we need the
experience of
being liberated
from.
So there are
these strata
in the stone,
in the earth,
that are like
memorial
dreaming
traces,
in a way.
And what I'm
suggesting is that
in each one of
us,
and in our
cohorts,
in our cultures,
in our
ethnicity,
in our
ancestors,
in our
progeny,
there are
layered,
there's a
layered richness
of interiority
that actually
contains the
entire history
of our
species.
There's a
way of
doing
a kind
of
archaeology
that isn't
merely
objective,
isn't merely
empirical,
that is
partly
magical,
or partly
transcendental.
And when you
hear stories,
for example,
people of
either
accidental
enlightenment,
or you have
some young
child who
at six
just starts
sitting still
and won't
move and
has to be
fed,
and some
guru comes
and says,
oh,
this one
has gone
beyond.
And when
you hear
stories of
intentional
enlightenment
where,
quote unquote,
right,
where someone
very committed
to the
meditation
path,
mostly you
will hear
similar
stories where
in fact
what I'm
speaking about
surfaces
in
consciousness.
Thus we
hear the
Buddha saying
something,
I don't know
what the
Buddha actually
said,
but we
hear stories
that the
Buddha said
I have
been
billions
of lives.
I have
been all
of the
beings
in a way.
This
might be
translated
as
past
lives,
but I
think,
I strongly
suspect
that the
actual
situation
is much
weirder than
past
lives,
and
is not
linear
in the
ways we
would
imagine.
So that
for example,
imagine
just as an
example that
you are
alive
locally
to your
consciousness
right now,
but like
a
constellation
in the
sky.
Imagine,
for example,
the Big
Dipper
as seen
from Earth.
Those
stars,
the shape
of the
Big Dipper
is seen
from a
point in
space.
Now,
I would
like to
know
the names
of those
stars
and how
distant
in space
time they
are from
each other,
because let's
be clear,
if you saw
it from
another angle
outside of
it,
it would
not form
a Dipper.
some of
the stars
might be
invisible,
or there
might be
other stars
that were
visible
in the
arrangement.
The
illusion,
it's not
actually an
illusion,
is it?
The
figuration
of the
Big Dipper
is,
we experience
it because
of where
we are
looking
from
in
time
space,
and so
to us
it's
a little
bit as
if
there's
a dot
to dot
drawing
there,
which over
time has
undergone
semantic
degradation
so that
we think
of it
as
a ladle
cup.
Because
I promise
you,
long ago
they were
not
thinking
that's
a ladle
cup,
they probably
didn't
think
that
what was
seen in
the sky
resembled
objects,
appliances,
or tools.
That would
be a very
unlikely
derivation,
derivation,
I think.
So we
should take
that
seriously,
the
unlikeliness
of such
a derivation.
I mean,
hilariously,
a couple
nights ago I
woke up from
dreaming,
just to give you
a sort of
related example,
and I
don't really
know what
was going
on.
And it
was sort
of hilarious,
but not
merely funny.
I got
the impression
of my
refrigerator,
hopefully I'll
come back to
this later,
because I want
to stay on
point here,
but I got
the impression
of my
refrigerator,
it's a white
refrigerator,
vinyl surfaced
with many
refrigerators,
and it
was deified.
It was like
this angelic
choirs and
rays of
divine light
coming off
the refrigerator,
which is a
very ridiculous
seeming,
to my rational
mind anyway,
completely ridiculous,
and even to
my
Luddite in
me that
abhors
machines.
It doesn't
merely abhor
machines.
I don't
merely abhor
them.
I recognize
that coupled
with the
insensate,
dissociate,
war and
prison-earing
monsters that
have captured
and colonized
are recolonizing
our existing
societies and
nations and
populations and
so forth.
Those things
are a
death sign.
Those are
the flags of
a coming
apocalypse.
And not just
an ever-coming
apocalypse,
right?
An apocalypse
that's happening
now has been
happening for a
good,
depending on how
you want to
count it,
a thousand
years,
but much more
so in the past
500 and much
more so in the
past one and
so forth.
A sort of
tidal, a
tide, a
heartbeat of
doom where
the humans
just are
ripping the
foundations of
their own
minds to
shreds in
terms of the
origins of
the possibility
of intelligence
and consciousness
in the
anciently
conserved
ecologies of
the planet,
which are the
most precious
thing around
here.
Not us,
our origins,
the womb,
this planetary
womb that
ever renews
itself and
hopefully doesn't
really need to
be penetrated in
order to be
fertilized,
right?
Light, the
divine virginal
penetration of
light, sunlight
and time
spaces, the
water of
time space
penetrated by
sunlight coupled
with the
physical
hypostases of
these primordial
more than
merely beings
generates life
here and
it is truly
holy.
But as I was
saying, those
stars in the
sky, they
are not
coherently
related to one
another except
by the angle of
our perspective.
they don't
belong to
some family
of local
anatomy, local
stellar anatomy.
I don't think.
I suspect they're
wildly distant from
each other and
it would be seen
completely differently
from another
distant angle.
Say if we drew a
circle around them,
if we circled,
actually if we
made a sphere
around the
Big Dipper at
the same distance
from which our
perspective arises,
we made a sphere,
then we just
traveled to
different perspectives
on that sphere,
very different
things would emerge
to our perspective
and what I'm
trying to say is
that imagine that
although your
sort of spirit
or soul,
however you want
to think about it,
and there's much
better ways to
think about it
than a spirit
or a soul,
the localization
that you think
of as yourself
is probably
similar to
that Big Dipper.
Imagine that
there are many,
many beings.
We could start
with a small number
to make it easy.
Let's say there's
12 just for kicks
and a couple
of those beings
are living in
the earliest time
of the humans
and not all
those beings
are human
but we're going
to pretend
they are for a minute
and they're living
in all different
times and places
of the earth.
We're going to keep
them on earth
for the moment
though that's not
actually necessary
either.
so there's beings
all throughout
the historical
phases of the
humans
and let's say
half of them
are before you
and half of them
are after you
so six
before you
and then you
in the middle
that you're the
13th one
so to speak
and then there's
six after you
in the future
and those beings
are all
simultaneously
existing
but you
the you-ness
the me
the me-ness
Darren
hopefully not
the mean-ness
but the me-ness
you perceive
yourself as
localized
in this
temporal
spatial
manifold
of relationships
when actually
you're a
constellation
of beings
with a
nucleus
much like
the
what we think
of as the
solar system
and
sometimes
you're the
sun
in that
family
sometimes
you're
you know
Saturn
it's funny
we have the
system where we
we establish
your relationship
between each of
the planets
and everyone
thinks oh
that's a bunch
of hokey
well those
people who
think that
are very
confused
but also
the people
who
reify
the system
of astrology
are just
as confused
because it's
neither
false
nor fact
both
of those
extremes
lose
the fragrance
of insight
that is
accessible to
us as
human beings
once things
become explicit
and we start
trying to say
what is a fact
and unless
we're in a
very limited
sort of cone
of purposive
orientation
and behavior
there are
applicable
there's an
applicable scope
to what we think
of as
empiricism
but let's be
really clear
what the
moderns mostly
do with
empiricism
is kill
they use that
to kill
stuff
I remember
I remember
my friend
Fi
Fernanda
from Brazil
she wanted
to become
a marine
biologist
until she
discovered
that what
that meant
was collecting
living creatures
from the sea
and killing
them
taking them
apart
studying
the bits
of course
there are
other ways
to do it
but
the classes
that she
was taking
she was
magically
in love
with the sea
creatures
just as I
am
until she
discovered
what
empiricism
is about
and what
we do
with it
which is
really the
wrong thing
and you
can see
again
here
the
terrifying
jagged
pointy
fingerprint
of colonization
this is what
I mean
by colonization
I don't
mean
necessarily
bad
people
mostly
men
and yes
men are
the execution
body
of colonization
because
historically
primarily
at least
in the
large
cohorts
men
were
the
disposable
soldier
class
and there's
so much
wow
there's so much
here
to look
at
so yeah
men were
the inaction
body
and
sometimes
men
often
perhaps
men
were
the
what
the
infected
dissociated
orienteering
measurers
rulers
measurers
of value
measurers
of
history
and
futurity
what does
history
mean
and what
will
we make
of this
potential
of our
lives
and moment
of our
cooperative
potential
one of my
new friends
Roger T
who I'm not
sure how to
pronounce his
last name
that's why I'm
not doing it
who has this
brilliant
sort of
matrilineally
communicated
from his
wife
method of
alignment
producing
alignment
in human
cohorts
particularly
in business
but not
necessarily
merely in
business
called us
apex
cooperators
it's a
brilliant
phrase
I'm not
sure if he
coined that
phrase
or who
coined it
but so
yeah it
looks like
it was
men
and I'm
not denying
that there's
a problem
with
make a
joke
here
with having
the you
know
external
three-part
flower
downstairs
historically
but this
this measuring
and what
the problem
is that
the males
who perpetrated
and executed
iterations of
recursive
colonization
were first
themselves
colonized
this is the
actual
this is the
thing we need
to see
and we
know
we have
some
we
I don't even
know who I
mean by we
let's just say
that culturally
and sociologically
we are
we have become
aware as
moderns
that
many of the
people
who perpetrate
violence
and subjugation
and murder
and rape
and violation
were themselves
subjected
to these
deprivations
and impoverishments
and terrors
in their
developmental
arcs
and it's not
clear
to me
anyway
that in a
coherent
or
small scale
coherent
human
family
tribe
culture
it's probably
extremely
uncommon
that
these
behaviors
emerge
and some
will say
things like
well we've seen
behavior like
this in
primates
okay
but did you
see primates
before humans
invaded the
jungle
and before
what is the
human effect
on the context
in which the
primates are
developing
what is the
human
what is the
effect
of the
humans
on
of the human
behavior
in the world
on the
primate
population
these
features
of
that which
exists
are connected
they're not
merely
you know
we would
ordinarily
think
rationally
that
if
the
monkeys
are in
a jungle
in Africa
where there
are no
humans
presuming there
was such
a jungle
and humans
are somewhere
else doing
things like
making war
and going
insane
together
killing up
everything that
moves and
most of what
doesn't
it wouldn't
affect
the primates
until
and unless
the humans
showed up
in the jungle
because we
presume that
there's no
way to
communicate
the
malignancy
from the
humans to
the primates
unless they're
proximal
this is not
true because
there's always
a dimension
of the context
where everything
is proximal
the planet
is a
unified
manifold
of
historical
relational
futural
what
transmissions
communication
so whenever
I hear
people saying
oh it's just
natural for
humans to be
I don't
believe it
I don't
believe that
at all
it's conceivable
but what it
looks more like
to me is an
infection
most of the
time
and maybe I
prefer to see
it this way
maybe I'm
biased
Graeber and
his writing
companion in
the dawn of
everything
push back
against the
idea that
humans have
been
catastrophically
misbehaving
toward each
other and
life in
general for
thousands of
years and
it's the law
of the land
and so forth
that myth
needs to come
down I
don't I
just don't
trust it at
all what I'm
trying to get
at is that
the origins of
the problems we
face are not
in the men
it's not
merely patriarchy
and what has
happened that's
terrifying is
that the
features of
our humanity
that are
vulnerable to
colonization
have been being
colonized by
something
and we can
think of this
something in a
variety of
different ways
for eons
and these
colonizing
contagions
these colonizing
pathological
processes
oh wow
here's the
dog man
with so many
dogs
and yet he
can keep
them all
coherent
hum
thank you so much
I need to have a chat with him at some point.
Because he's really profoundly skillful at managing a large group of unrelated dogs.
Nearly certain those dogs don't come from one family, one household.
So, we have to look carefully into the history, the histories, and not just the written histories.
The histories that are submerged within us.
It's my direct experience that not just the history of life on earth, and not just the history of the humans,
but the history of what we think of as the universe, and the history of its origins, the origin places, and the origin beings,
is encoded in the strata of our being.
And this is recoverable to us, whensoever and to whatever degree we may agree to recover it, to seek it, to quest for it,
to inquire, as Amun Hillman, the half-mad prophet, tells us.
He, in his linguistic neuromorphosis, tells us that the ancient languages are actually doorways
and doorways into other, into lost potentials of our humanity.
And for the moment, at least, I'm not a big fan.
What does that even mean?
I have a large fan in my hand, and I keep waving it.
Now, I find his playful and hilarious and terrifying, manic, manisthaic, prophetic genius,
inspiring and nourishing and propelling.
But one of the things he says is that, and I may have this wrong,
but he's saying something like the originary idea that becomes, in our time, the word history
actually comes from bringing a question to the probably adolescent sybils
at the oracle places in the ancient world.
And he's talking specifically about places in Europe
and what we think of now maybe as the Middle East and Greece and so forth.
Greece primarily, but also its surrounding, like the empire, I guess.
I don't know where all the sybils were.
I don't know where we have records of them being.
But what he was saying is that this idea of history, it's not stories about what happened.
It's to become pregnant with the urgency of a question
and pursue that question beyond our common inclinations to answer it,
to declare some, oh, here is what happened.
No, no.
It's to become the re-happening, the living anamnesis of the question.
And this is the kind of potential we are born to experience the exaltation of.
And there's nearly no one like Amun.
Other biblical scholars or classicists may criticize him and say things like,
oh, he's taking a specific sense of a specific word
and he's promoting it to the primordial sense over all instances of this word
in such a way as to twist the perspective,
to produce the truly bizarre narrative
that he wants us to swallow
about ancient Greece, the origins of Christianity,
Christos, the Medusa, Medea,
medicine, all these things.
And hilariously,
some of those critics,
Dan McClellan among them,
might be
technically,
linguistically,
and perhaps even cognitively, quote-unquote, correct.
They're missing the point.
They're missing the point.
Amun's unique
and, you know,
intoxicated,
right,
the elixir that Amun is making
is
cygenic,
generative of mind states
otherwise inaccessible,
and they're looking at something.
It's just like people
who've only seen airplanes
or jet aircraft
which are made for war
or passenger
or cargo
transit.
They're looking at
basically,
they're looking at a UFO.
They're looking at something
from outside.
It wasn't even made by humans.
And it doesn't do the things
that the human-made aircraft do
at all.
It has no concern
about those things.
It's concerned
with transporting us
to insight
and reestablishing
anciently lost relationships
and
correcting
nonsensical
histories
that, for us,
have become prisons
of ignorance
and blindness.
And time will tell
whether the elixir
of Amun's performative,
and I don't mean that
in the derogatory,
modern,
critical sense
at all.
The elixirs
of Amun's performances
are truly generative
of anamnesis
and
remembering.
However,
personally,
I find them
profound
and brilliant
in an admittedly
iconoclastic
and provocative
way.
So let's see
if I can recover
my threads here.
the colonized
colonizers.
The recolonization.
So now,
what's going on
in modernly?
Okay?
We have the rise
of the internet,
which starts out
looking pretty virtuous.
it resembles
in potential
the agora
of ancient Greece
where
Socrates
and other
philosophers,
rhapsodes
and sophists,
perhaps,
gathered
the common people
day to day
to pursue
wisdom and insight,
but also
also to pursue
convincing,
condemnation,
indictment,
judgment,
opinion airing.
And the internet
began
this way,
but it was
colonized
and it colonized
us.
And what was it
colonized by?
It was colonized
by forces
that advertised
themselves
as protectors.
Okay?
the NSA,
National Security
Administration,
the ridiculous
enforcement arms
of the government
that rose
in the wake
of 9-11
as if 9-11
were produced
specifically
to generate
those
recursively
colonizing
lethal
organizations
and to
create
a future
of
panopticon-like
surveillance
that would
collapse
not merely
the possibility
of a free
society,
whatever that
might mean,
whatever it's
possible for that
to mean,
but it would
turn our own
homes and
relationships
into prisons,
weapons that
we could be
threatened with.
And then
with the rise
of social media,
which again
in the beginning
was a way
to bring people
together
and to
celebrate
our
potentials
for intelligence
and creativity
and insight
and play,
quickly again
became colonized
by corporate
agendas,
driven primarily
by two forces,
advertising.
one of the
most
malignant
demons
of our
modern
world
and
governmental
surveillance
of citizens,
these twin
cyclopean,
I mean,
that's probably
insulting the
cyclops,
but yeah,
these
monsters,
straight up
monsters,
that will
eat our
lives,
minds,
and children
and sell
the bones
to the
highest bidder.
So,
you can see
this recursive
iterative
recolonization
of our
relationships,
our
interiority,
our
thought,
our
dreaming,
our bodies,
our metabolism,
right?
And it's
as if
it's
a layered
antithesis
to
anamnesis.
it's
a layered
like an
acid that
just eats
the
foundations
of memory
and
produces
structured
skeletal
remains
that are
commoditized
and turned
into
the
fuel
for
future
iterations
of new
forms
of
recolonization.
you know,
it's
easy to
distract us
with
indictments
that make
little
sense.
if we're
actually
concerned
about
the
injustice
of the
histories
of
colonization,
slavery,
misogyny,
misanthropy,
misbiorelation,
abiotic
omnicide,
then we
need not
so much
to indict
and prosecute
the histories.
We need to
understand the
origins and
we must
establish
coherent
vessels
for our
communal
development,
education,
anamnesis,
healing,
enrichment,
and
something,
you know,
what does
decolonization
mean?
we can
imagine
it means
something like,
well,
you know,
when the
children have
lice,
you put
medicine in
their hair.
No,
we need to
do the
opposite
of,
well,
both things
maybe.
We need a
very enlightened
idea and
direction
for any
such project
and it
must be
self,
it must
iteratively
decolonize
itself.
Whatever I say
to myself
out loud,
to myself,
I'm going to
pick up five
pieces right
now.
That was
really beautiful
what that guy
was saying.
So,
he was saying
like,
this guy's
really interesting.
He's clearly
a not ordinarily
minded person
because he has
an enthusiasm
that's far
beyond what
ordinary people
would usually
have,
right?
And he was
saying,
you know,
the last
few times
I told
myself as
I was out
on my walk
I'm going
to pick up
five pieces
of litter.
Each time
I found
like a pair
of expensive
Ray-Bans
or one
I found
a hundred
dollars.
Every time
I found
something valuable.
This is
kind of
what I'm,
this is a
strange sort
of synchronicity.
we,
if our
orientation
is
indictment
and
prosecution,
it's,
the path
is too
expensive
and will
continue
to colonize
itself.
And one
of the ways
that we'll
do this
is with
nomenclature.
Actually,
two of the
ways.
No,
it's like
the Spanish
Inquisition.
Every time
you look,
there's more
ways.
But yeah,
it's with
nomenclature,
in other
words,
jargon.
And it's
with
ideology.
Ideological
fanaticism.
So we
have to
be aware
of those,
we have to
be aware
of the
way
that
a purpose
of orientation
that starts
out
virtuous
and altruistic
in a
trustworthy
sense
is easily
captured
even by
its own,
by the
threads of
its own
origins.
And so
we have to
find a way
to preserve
the
possibilities
of virtue,
insight,
learning,
healing,
growth,
so forth.
There's
the
terrifying
machine
signal
and then
the
horrible
noise
of death.
Every
animal
that ever
heard that
was soon
to die.
Our
cells know
this is
the bell
of doom
when you
hear the
engines.
Almost,
I mean,
there are a few
exceptions,
there's a few
exceptions.
I guess
the engines
of the
ships of
the Sea
Shepherd
Conservation
Society,
for example,
are an
unusual
inversion
of that
paradigm.
So what I'm
trying to get us
to remember
here is
that
all of
the
executors
of
colonization
were almost
certainly
victims
of
colonization
first.
They were
infected
with the
thrisp-like
structure
of processes
that would
convert them,
their lives,
their children,
their ancestors,
the meaning
of their
origins
and the
shape of
their future
to
omnicide.
Dead terrain,
the production
of commodities,
the collection
of commodities
in the coffers
of the
powerful and
the wealthy
who are
themselves
sort of
the seed
bed,
the dead
inside
seed bed
of the
pathologies
that become
the
inaction
body
of the
colonizing
forces.
And we
must discover
and I mean
I think I have
some keys to
this which I
have spoken
of in the
past.
We must
discover and
recover the
origins of
the problem
and clearly
see.
Okay,
I think we
just got a
clue here.
so these
geese are
flipping out
and the
males are
getting all
spun up
and they're
getting spun
up because
a human
gave a
couple of
them some
crackers.
It would be
hilarious to
discover that
like,
that one of
the origins
of the
problem
of colonization
and I
think there's
probably a
lot of
evidence,
quote unquote,
for this,
is simply the
introduction of
carbohydrates.
Once you can
store up huge
amounts of
carbohydrates,
it's sort of
like what
happens when
you put a
nectar bottle,
you know,
a bottle of
dyed sugar
water in a
population of
hummingbirds.
They might have
been a little
bit provocative
before but
once you put
all those
commodities in
one place,
now you've
got two
problems.
You've got to
protect them
from people
who might
want to
take them
and it's a
really attractive
prize because
it represents
what?
Convenience.
Okay, so
we're going to
see two things
here, fuel
and convenience
and there's
a third
thing which
is essentially
metals,
particularly
what we
think of as
precious metals
and jewels,
crystals,
diamonds,
gold,
silver,
platinum,
copper,
bronze,
iron,
diamonds,
emeralds,
rubies,
sapphires.
So, and I'm
not even getting
close to what is
actually going on.
These are the
later stage
catalysts of
devastation.
What did they
really want when
they sent ships to
the new world?
Well, they wanted
gold.
What were they
after?
Gold.
They might have
been thinking
land, but mostly
they were thinking
gold.
Did those savages
have gold stored
up somewhere?
Let's get that
gold.
Or at least
this is the story
we tell and that
story is probably
three quarters
wrong, but
it maybe
resembles our
own projections.
And projection
is a large part
of the problem
because
if you think
your opponent
is up to
something nefarious,
then you have
to get there
first.
This is the
race to the
bottom,
the perverse
incentive,
incentivization,
elucidated by
Daniel Schmachtenberger
and others
of the
Game B
or New
Civilization
project.
What has to
happen,
obviously,
is that we
have to
establish some
options that
are so much
more compelling
than the
zero-sum
competitive
pathology
we're currently
enacting and
being conscripted
to and
punished by
and devastated
for.
We aren't
the people
of the lie.
We are the
generation of
lying.
It's different.
The context
is so
catastrophically
multilayeredly
toxic,
counterfeit,
projective.
Everywhere we
see presentations
that advertise
virtue and
underneath are
essentially
self-purifying
disease
vectors.
And this
is the
concept that
I use.
my quest
to understand
this resulted
in a series
of visions,
one of which
introduced the
concepts of
the cognitium,
which is the
network of
human minds,
the mimula,
which is all
the features of
connection in
that network,
and thrisps,
which compete
for dominance of
that network
under conditions
in which
the organic
and natural
orienteering
principles
that would
guide and
nourish and
protect our
collective
insight,
memory,
intelligence,
altruism,
virtue,
when those
break down,
boom,
thrisps
everywhere.
It's
similar to
certain
biological
processes
like
those that
burn down
our neural
networks with
prion proteins,
for example.
One of the
things,
Krutzfeldt-Jacobs
disease,
or otherwise
known as
mad cow
disease,
and similar
prion proteins
disorders.
As I
understand it,
the prions
are
essential
to
the
differentiation
of our
nervous
systems and
neural networks
in the brain
in early
development.
Similarly to
how something
kills off the
flesh between
our fingers
structures so
that you
get these
differentiated,
very useful
articulate
appendages,
something
resembling that
happens in
the brain in
our early
developmental
arcs with
neurons.
a lot of
them have to
be burned
off.
And what
that means
is that's
one of the
things that
makes us
each unique
because we
all undergo
this kind
of interior
extinction
event,
and usually
we think,
oh,
extinction is
bad.
And it
certainly is
if we're
burning down
anciently
conserved
ecologies to
make more
machines and
stuff.
that's
insane.
That's
not,
there's
nothing
coherent or
biorelationally
integral about
that.
That's just
madness and
wrongness.
And yeah,
you can take
the bigger
picture,
sure.
You can say
things like,
oh,
life is
resilient,
earth is
resilient.
I'd love
to see
where that
perspective is
arising from
because if
it's arising
from some
kind of
empirical or
materialistic
perspective
based on
what you
think is
the historical
data and
so forth,
that's
dissociative,
that's
dissociated.
You're not
connecting with
nature at
all.
You're just
being a
disembodied,
grasping
rationalist.
So you're
almost certainly
going to be
wrong about
nearly everything
having to do
with organisms
if that's
your anchor
in consciousness
and concern.
A mother's
concerns,
much more
trustworthy.
She bears
children.
She has
to fund
them.
She has to
build their
bodies from
her own
biology.
The calcium
of her bones,
the metabolic
products of
her body,
her heartbeat
becomes the
context in
which life
emerges.
And while
our planet
is only
metaphorically
feminine in
this sense,
that metaphor
goes very
deep and is
very powerful.
it's not
merely a
figure of
speech.
So we
must recover
the origins
of the
problem
that led
to our
defection
from memory,
humanity,
insight,
virtue,
mutual
intelligence,
mutual
concern,
awareness,
our real
cooperative
abilities.
And we
must find
ways to
establish
vehicles to
conserve,
develop,
enact,
and transmit,
and transmit,
communicate,
these potentials
into the
existing bodies
of anti-culture
that largely own
our species at
this time,
our children.
human.
And perhaps
we may be
so lucky
as to
stumble
into
ways of
being human
that please
our ancestors
by fulfilling
their dreams
and what they
hoped for
and worked
for in
the deepest
recesses of
their hearts,
minds,
and spirits.
all of
us
moderns
and for
millions
of
lifetimes
we have
been slaves
to things
that don't
even exist.
We have
been slaves
to ghosts
and shadows
in the
human
cognitium
presenting
as virtues
or progress
and delivering
omnicide,
amnesia,
torture,
despair,
devastation
of our
spirit,
our
communality,
the replacement
of that
with
prison-earing
panopticon-like
surveillance
systems
that
aren't
killing us
off
directly
at the
moment.
And this
is actually
part of
the problem
with the
weird
results of
technology.
There are
fates worse
than death
and some
of them
involve
the
slow
erosion
of our
interior
assets
and potentials
and if
you can
get at
the thing
with which
we tell
the difference,
the thing
with which
we would
otherwise
notice what
is happening,
then
anything that
gets at
that,
anything that
gets at
the fundamental
basis of
our capacity
to discern
change,
if you
can co-opt
that,
then the
entire
bank
of the
history and
future of
life on
earth,
of human
beings,
of our
interiority,
is now
open for
rape.
And you
can get
away with
anything you
can imagine.
You just
have to go
slowly enough,
you just
have to turn
the heat up
in the water
slowly enough
that it
doesn't
overcome
the
disabled
senses
that would
alert us
to,
we must
oppose
this,
that would
organize
and
galvanize
us
into
communal,
into
heroic
communal
organization,
intelligence,
resilience,
and activity.
So these
are a few
of the
things
that are
in my
awareness
today,
or have
risen in
my
awareness
while
I
muse
with you,
my
listeners,
in the
hope of
better ways
of seeing,
in the
hope of
anamnesis,
in the
hope of
pleasing the
ancestors and
the muses,
and perhaps
the angels.
I'm so
grateful to
have this
time together
and for
your kind
attention,
your
enthusiasm,
your wonder,
your
curiosity,
the spirit
within you
of heroic
questing
recovery
and rescue
that is
innate
to our
human
nature.
May your
ways and
minds and
dreams,
be beautiful
and healing
and profound
and may
you find
joyful
relation
with all
the aspects
of yourself,
your histories,
your futures,
your ancestors,
your progeny,
and all of the
beings who
are in fact
a single
family.
thank you for
joining me.
I look forward
to learning
together again
very soon.
Bye-bye for now.

your
