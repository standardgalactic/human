Hello, everybody. Welcome.
If you're listening today, I'd like you to log in and do two things.
First is, tell me why you're here.
What brought you here today?
Why? Why are you listening?
And whatever is actually going on, just tell me what that might be.
It doesn't have to sound articulate or complicated.
I just want to know, you know, what got you here?
And this isn't a marketing survey.
It's just curiosity.
And I've already forgotten the second thing.
Perhaps it'll come back to me.
This is the problem with consciousness generally.
And we all experience this problem uniquely.
It's a problem of memory.
One of my friends, her first husband, had an eidetic memory and could tell her exactly the
sequence of events for any day in the 20 years of their marriage.
This guy's hand-feeding ravens, which is pretty fucking fun, I've got to admit.
I'm not sure what he's hand-feeding them.
I'm not sure what he's hand-feeding them.
Something very small.
Of course, it's against code to feed animals in the park, and it is a very dangerous thing
to do.
The kid thought that because the geese were running toward him, they were intending to
attack him.
But it's really just because he's got food.
No sweat.
All right, guys.
Ready?
Yeah.
Feeding the animals.
It's a huge problem.
Of course, on the other hand, these are city animals.
Feeding them does cause all kinds of trouble, to be clear.
And I sometimes feed them, and so do a few of my friends.
Okay, so what was the second thing?
What brought you here today?
Oh, yeah, first of all, what's the problem we have?
The problem we have is with thread memory, actually.
And it becomes a different kind of problem for different people.
Now, obviously, someone with eidetic memory, or someone whose memory is extremely sophisticated,
effective, profound, they're living in an entirely different kind of mind.
That's not always a benefit.
It's certainly beneficial for some things, and we might imagine many things, but it also
presents dangers that could be very difficult to evade.
Particularly, anything related to hypervigilance is going to be problematically exacerbated by,
in many cases, in some cases, by memory.
So, what was the second thing?
What brought you here?
Hmm, yeah, I can't find it.
I mean, I have lots of ideas about what other things I could ask you to do.
But yeah, log in, say hello, and explain, just tell me something about what got you here today.
And I'll think of some second thing, if I can't actually, if I can't get my hippocampus spun up
to map the history of my conscious imagination and get us to the original second thing
that I was, that I originally had in mind.
So I know, at least partially, what my initial direction is here today.
And I'm willing to change that direction and explore around, you know, to birdwalk a bit,
sort of have a ideological or perceptual, perspectival, purposive walkabout.
My initial motivation and my inspiration
is the catastrophic weirdness that we're experiencing around identity.
And I'm not just talking about identity politics, though that was an early contender for catalytic origins.
But even that had to be inspired by something, and it wasn't just the academic hijinks
and nefarious hyper-articulations of the postmoderns,
who I have mistrusted since I was first exposed to them.
As a language poet in the 80s, with somebody experimenting with language
and surrounded by other sophisticated, academic, linguistic, semiotic-oriented people,
like Daniel Davidson, who took his life sometime around 1988, maybe,
and was the co-editor on the second issue of my magazine, Cyanosis,
took his life, ironically, by suffocation.
He introduced me to people like Deleuze and Guattari, Avatel Ronell, her telephone book,
Foucault, Derrida, etc.
And there's this fierce para- or neo-feminist contingent within that pie slice of academia.
And I remember being at once impressed and profoundly skeptical.
Impressed and I felt antipathy toward these arcs.
You know, there used to be this publication called Simeo Text.
And this is back when I'm trying to figure out
how to publish an art and literary journal on my own.
And I was really interested in the intersection between science,
biology, medicine, and art.
Which is why in the second issue I went into the surgery with Francis Connelly
for eight hours at Stanford and watched her take the top of a man's head off
and scrape a baseball-sized chunk of his brain out.
Or what was the right, what was the name of the device that basically liquefies tissue?
Wow.
I can't remember.
And then after you liquefy the tissue,
you have to cauterize all the little blood vessels by hand.
Wow.
It was incredible.
Then I watched a male surgeon walk in and essentially undo eight hours of her work.
Well, this isn't good enough.
A man didn't do it.
Typical.
You know, part of what she was complaining about
and part of why we have actually valid feminist concerns.
But as with any branch of concern,
what you can think of is either the inner toward the point-like slice of the three-dimensional pie,
four-dimensional pie since time's involved.
I mean, it could be a seven-dimensional pie.
But you can either have it near the point or the periphery.
You have these very extreme embodiments that tend toward profoundly ideological concerns.
Rather than trying to see better or resolve an issue,
there's a kind of militant, jargonist, jingoist, hyper-linguistic, hyper-semiotic, deconstructivist.
And it's political deconstructivism.
And this stuff is fascinating to me.
I definitely wouldn't want it to go away.
I wouldn't say, like, let's get rid of that.
But I would say, we should handle this the same way we handle plutonium.
This is not what we will use to solve our problems
or to see better
or to understand the origins of the issues
that are swarming, you know, explosively, volcanically, radioactively, pathologically
around us in our modern experience.
I've never actually read any Andrea Dworkin.
I probably haven't read any extremist, feminist authors.
And I'm sure someone could say, you know, why are you calling them extremist?
And not only that, you have, you know, you have three pieces downstairs.
You have nothing to say about feminism.
Nothing.
You're a man.
Well, you're sort of right.
But actually, when it comes right down to it, before I was a man, I was a woman.
I was an organ in my mother's body.
And when my mother took me to National Organization of Women's Meetings
in the 70s in Stockton, California,
where I met astonishing minds and a lot of lesbians,
even though I had no idea what that could possibly mean or be back then,
because I was unusually and catastrophically sexually naive as a young human being.
My goodness, with the naivete.
It's not gone yet.
I'm still partly that way.
In any case, those were the first intelligent humans I ever met,
and they made a significant impression on me.
And I certainly felt the compelling tidal forces of people who said things like,
war is not healthy for children and other living things.
And free to be you and me.
An album I listened to with great passion and playful wonder.
There was a book written by an insane woman for children called Donna DQ Donut
that has disappeared along with its author.
Somewhere in the world there is this text,
how I would love to recover that thing somehow,
about a girl who discovers that puddles are actually portals to another universe,
which turns out to be a fact.
Not the kind of fact you find in science.
The kind of fact you find in daring, adventurous quests to recover the nature of not merely the real,
but the possible.
And that's actually the topic that I'm interested in today.
Not, as it might appear,
forming up against postmoderns and pomofeminism and hyper...
I don't know what.
Yeah, hyper-theories, extremism, ideological extremism, linguistic extremism, lexical extremism.
And one of the dangers of language is the incredibly compelling power and joy of coining jargon.
And I myself love this, but I rarely do it for militant purposes.
And when it is done for militant purposes, the results are weapons.
And there's a time and a place for combat.
There's a time and a place for battle.
But before we go there,
we had better be able to see
very, very deeply,
very clearly,
with
many eyes from history,
and many eyes concerned with
not survival,
but with the preservation of the possibility of health,
intelligence, insight, awareness, consciousness.
It's far too easy to deceive ourselves into a corner.
And thereafter discover
that
along with the enemy,
we have, you know, cut off our own feet.
That's one of my DJ friends.
Yeah, exactly.
One of my DJ friends was like...
You know,
we and the other are the same hand.
And when the pinky's attacking the thumb,
screaming about ideological
invective and indictment,
wow, we should back the fuck up.
And, you know,
get some mirrors,
some satellite mirrors around us
so that we can gain some perspective
outside the thin slice of reality
that has become erect
in consciousness
and threatens to weaponize
the whole damn affair.
We've seen this over and over again
in human history.
If it ever had a reasonable result,
I don't know
when that was.
That was trippy.
And he backed up
within a million...
Look at that bucket.
You see how close that is?
That's close.
That was good.
That was amazing.
That was amazing.
The guy just backed his truck up
and there were some buckets
behind the truck.
And the space between the bumper
and the buckets
was about...
maybe three millimeters.
I'm not inclined to suppose
that he did that on purpose.
Nonetheless,
the result
is incredible.
You know,
we have this capacity
that I love.
I've always been
fascinated by the
process of estimation.
And long hours
with early
betas
and version 1.0
and stuff
of Adobe Illustrator.
allowed me to play
with this.
But so, too,
did certain jobs.
I was an estimator
for a printing company.
God,
what was it called?
In Santa Rosa.
In the...
probably the early 80s.
Yeah,
I can't remember.
But yeah,
I've always been
fascinated by
estimating things
and
a lot of the times
this
involves doubling
an estimate
and then halving it again
or halving an estimate
and then doubling it again.
And sometimes
just halving it.
Halving it.
So you get close
and then you zoom
in 100%
and you get
that much closer.
And,
you know,
with Adobe Illustrator
you didn't have
infinite zoom
but you had
way more
capacity
for
tight
tolerances
in geometric
relationships
than in any
previous software
by many
orders of magnitude
not by a little bit.
In any case
I'm in danger
of losing
the thread here.
So
identity.
Oh,
I remember
my hippocampus
finally spun up.
I remember
the second thing.
So let me know
what you,
what brought you here today.
If you'd be so kind.
It's a small favor to ask.
I don't subject you
to advertising.
You don't have to
buy my content.
So do me this little favor
if you'd be so kind.
And the second thing is
ask a question.
Ask me
any question
and I'll answer
in
the comments.
Seems like a fair trade,
right?
I want you
to catalyze
my
sense of purpose
and orientation
and concern.
So I just
kind of want to
turn this around
at least
a little bit.
And I also
want to hear
your voice
even if it's
just in text.
Okay.
So
identity.
My motto
I've been
watching closely
over the past
say
10.
It's more.
It's also less.
Years.
As the concepts
that underlie
the foundations
of how we make
determinations
are first
blurred
and then
compromised
and
and then
dumpster fire
inverted
upside down
backwards
inside out
weaponized
against us
and let me be
really clear
if you had
a
if you had
a transcendental
enemy
or
you as an
individual
were facing
for example
an entire
nation
and not
the nation
of the people
the dead
inside
pathologically
right
the cognitive
equivalent
of bioweapons
that are the
result
of enemies
like Facebook
Twitter
Instagram
Pinterest
TikTok
China
Russia
the United
States
Iran
Pakistan
India
if you
were facing
an entire
nation
I mean
it's much
worse than
that
imagine
that you're
facing
the entire
array
of the
warlike
dead inside
processes
that have
taken over
humanity
in our
time
and are
running it
like
an
like an
array of
war games
that
recursively
expand
their
dimensionality
over the
span of
picoseconds
right
you know
trillions of
a second
or whatever
and that
this is going
on all
around us
all the
time
and we
have no
capacity
to
to
understand
to detect
to cope
with it
the first
thing that
is gone
after
in such
a situation
is our
capacity
to
detect
things
which means
our
capacity
to discern
to
distinguish
and not
just our
capacity
to discern
and
distinguish
but the
underlying
orientations
the underlying
concerns
memories
dreams
hopes
visions
urgencies
of our
human
and
social
nature
and history
and origin
these things
something
an array
of things
that aren't even
things
have gone
after these
assets
have compromised
them
and are
busy
weaponizing
them against
our own
minds
each other
the world
the history
and future
of life
on earth
the possibilities
of human
intelligence
or coherent
thought
behavior
decision making
and
this is why
I would like
to announce
today
as I have
implied
previously
that
2024
is not
a year
I think
that the
last year
and it
was only
barely one
that we
as a
species
will experience
maybe forever
but at least
for quite some
time
was that
year previous
to this
one which
was still
at least
slightly
a year
the ontological
status
of 2024
is
missing
in action
it is
anti
whatever
whatever you
might think
it is
it isn't
that
the reasons
you thought
you could
think what
it was
are not
reasons
your thinking
is not
thought
and I'm not
trying to
convince you
of anything
or
make dangerous
suggestions
here
mimetically
or
in any
other way
I'm actually
trying to
comment on
my own
experience
this is
the breakdown
not only
of identity
but of the
faculties
that we
might otherwise
employ
to
orient
the
purposes
with which
we apply
consciousness
to the
tasks
of
evaluation
determination
measurement
distinguishing
the whole
understructure
not merely
of rationality
and logic
which still
exist
as potential
disciplines
disciplines
that we
transmit
generation
to generation
that we
enact
in various
specialized
and unspecialized
fields
that stuff's still there
mathematics still exists
even though we have
people running around
saying
one times one
is two
thanks Terrence
because things
weren't loopy
enough yet
and
you know
if that guy
actually gave us
any actionable
insight
I'd love to
see it
because after
listening to him
for three hours
basically I just
felt that
A
and this is a
personal thing
maybe the future
will
if there is
one
whatever the hell
that word
even means
anymore
maybe the future
will
you know
validate
his ravings
I thought
it was hilarious
that Joe Rogan
said it took
him three days
to recover
he was like
out of his
mind
I think
it was out
of his
mind
because
Terrence
is
has a
mode of
charisma
that is
para-hypnotic
if not
actually
hypnotic
and I
detected that
early on
in his
his
lecture
which one
of my
friends
Josh
recommended
and I
was
extremely
critical
of that
lecture
I listened
to the
whole
three
hours
I did
not learn
one thing
that I
had not
already
been aware
of
not one
and much
of what
Terrence
very
controversially
proposed
and very
egotistically
I am
the greatest
mind
that has
ever
lived
fuck
Schrodinger
fuck
Hamiltonians
who gives a
shit about
the entire
history of
physics
it's me
and my
son
we
remember
when we
were in
wombs
and blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
and I
didn't
learn
one
thing
and
maybe
I was
turned
off
and so
my
learning
abilities
were
inhibited
but
yeah
no
cookies
for
Terrence
in my
view
I
can
learn
from
listening
to
almost
anyone
including
little
children
for some
reason
the vault
doors of
insight
and purpose
in my
mind
closed
and locked
against
that guy
by the
way
I think
it's
important
just
to
notice
that
he
actually
says
that
he
formed
the
purpose
in
his
heart
to
destroy
humanity
but
thankfully
he came
to his
senses
due to
the
loving
care
of
his
wife
like
that
gives
you a
pretty
good
view
into
what
what's
going
on
in
that
mind
in
the
first
place
a
lot
of
geniuses
and
prodigies
have
chips
on
their
shoulder
and
sometimes
we're
driven
by
our
chips
even
my
own
mind
I'm
not
totally
against
having
a
chip
on
one
shoulder
I
am
against
making
that
the
star
of
Bethlehem
of
one's
genius
or
prodigy
or
spirit
though
there
are
occasional
instances
where
that
even
works
or
is
important
personally
I tend
to trust
things
like
anamnesis
which is
unforgetting
a process
not
a
destination
virtue
altruism
the
beauty
and
people
say
yeah
you know
you've
evicted
your
shadow
no
I
haven't
evicted
my
shadow
I
have
a
broad
deep
rich
relationship
with
my
shadow
too
but
if I
start
having
thoughts
that
orient
around
things
like
vengeance
or
war
I
tend
to
back
the
fuck
up
start
asking
myself
some
questions
so
yeah
identity
what the
hell
is
going
on
and
see
that's
the
problem
the
thing
with
which
we
would
make
such
determinations
has
been
thoroughly
recursively
compromised
and
maybe
has
even
been
compromised
in
such
a
way
as
to
cause
it
to
become
self
compromising
right
every
time
you
touch
it
it
gets
worse
and
again
I
want
to
be
really
clear
let's
help
each
other
preserve
our
capacities
for
wisdom
and
insight
but in
order to
do that
we may
need to
understand
the
problem
and
as I
spiral
into
this
concern
today
let's
agree
that we
will
generate
together
a kind
of
anti-gravity
that
resists
the pull
of this
so that
we can
heal
these
faculties
and
reforge
them
together
however
to do
that
we
might
need
a
clear
view
of
what's
going
on
or
a
clear
and
pragmatic
understanding
of the
forces at
play
and
you know
if you
can turn
the
faculties
that
measure
and make
distinctions
and make
decisions
against
their own
root
and
by the
way
this is
a well
known
feature
of the
art
of war
well
known
feature
of
psyops
in
general
and
I mean
I wish
I could
say
that we
were the
victims
of a
psyop
wow
that would
be so
much
better
than
what's
going
on
no
this
is
a
swarming
encyclopedia
of
layered
psyop
like
like a
profusion
of
self
progenerating
psyop
syrups
that were
just
you know
as people
as nations
as individuals
were just
glued
down
with
and
you know
let's put
some solvent
on that glue
and dissolve
it
but first
let's understand
it
so
the thing
that seems
to me
to be
going
on
is
that
these
faculties
have been
compromised
in such
a way
reminiscent
of the way
HIV
attacks
the immune
system's
ability
to detect
it
right
and thus
to respond
to it
and I'm
not even
necessarily
certain
that this
is entirely
a problem
where the
humans
are doing
this on
purpose
though it's
clear that
there are
many many
factions
that are
doing this
on purpose
because
it's a
branch
of warfare
that not
only you
can get
away
with
it's
self-obscuring
you won't
see the
footprints
you won't
be able
to find
the culprit
because the
thing you
find things
with
is gone
right
so that's
the
that's like
the
the holy
grail
of asymmetric
advantage
as long
as
the thing
you introduce
into play
as long
as you
somehow
your people
your government
your faction
of your
government
that wants
power
or your
corporation
whatever
as long
as you
can
initiate
structure
and sustain
immunity
we have
unfortunately
in this
situation
a variety
of
a many
many branched
tree
of the cure
is deadlier
than the disease
and doesn't work
right
too
so yeah
this is an
actual
quagmire
a real
apocalyptic
mess
and I'm
reminded
of
late
passages
in the
bible
and other
books
that basically
warn us
of a situation
that is so
grim
that
we'd be
better off
you know
in any
other state
any
other
so yes
the problem
identity
is collapsing
and when we
see
this
what does
this produce
it produces
dysphoria
and not just
gender dysphoria
it produces
ideological
dysphoria
logical
dysphoria
deterministic
dysphoria
creative
dysphoria
you know
one of the
most dangerous
things we could
possibly do
is develop
machines
that emulate
minds
the way
that our
large language
models do
and similar
systems
and part of the
reason that that
could be
absolutely lethal
is that we
don't believe
that there's a
field effect
of cognition
on earth
and that there's
some things
you could do
that are so
dangerous
that you won't
even get to
know that
they're dangerous
because they
will
these activities
these processes
will affect
the thing
that you use
to go
looking for
their effects
with
right
and so
if you fuck
up the network
of minds
that generates
human cognition
moment to moment
and historically
and futurially
if you fuck
that thing up
by introducing
something to it
with which
the structure
of the network
cannot possibly
cope
it will collapse
there's no
concern about
this
the humans
in their groups
aren't merely
insane
they are
generating
a profusion
of psychotic
auto-weaponizing
processes
that it is
impossible
to understand
it's literally
not conceivably
possible to
understand the
impact of
large hadron
collider
exactly such
process
nobody knows
what the fuck
effect
it might have
to reproduce
energies
that
resemble those
far back
near
the origins
of the universe
atomic weapons
yeah
let's just do
this because
Germany is
really scary
Japan is
really scary
someone is
going to do
it first
we better
do it
bioweapons
you know
use mRNA
on the entire
population
of humans
mRNA vaccines
that get
your cells
to produce
the spike
proteins
oh yeah
that was
a great
idea
I can't
wait to
see
I mean
my own
body
having
participated
in that
experiment
wow
devastating
to my
nervous
system
immediately
permanently
as far
as I can
tell
yeah
very stupid
idea
and
you know
50 things
that we
can't
like
we're in a
situation
where black
swans aren't
the problem
black swan
generators are
proliferating
all around us
and the
human
the processes
that have
captured us
at the
societal
commercial
military
prisoneering
at these
levels
these processes
have become
the opposite
of gods
whatever
that is
if that's
demons
I don't
know
and they're
just proliferating
everywhere
this has
happened before
in human
society
there are
thousands of
tablets
to hear it
told from
Julian James
and others
from Babylon
or maybe
Mesopotamia
I think it's
Babylon though
I mean
the name of
that place
changes over
time so
what's the
name of it
I don't
know
Chaldea
I actually
don't know
that say
like the
gods have
disappeared
the demons
are propagating
everywhere
the sort
of our
the angel
of our
people
does not
respond
to us
they've hung
up the
phone
the personal
angel that
walks with me
always is
gone
and in
its place
something
terrifying
now look
I'm not
trying to
play
doom
singer
here
and
it's
a job
I can
do
fairly
well
people
like
Daniel
Schmachtenberger
and Eric
Weinstein
both of whom
I profoundly
respect and
admire
particularly
Weinstein
if we wanted
to elect
an intelligent
president
it should
be that
dude
I mean
there might
be a
feminine
contender
it isn't
Sabine
Hoffestadder
for sure
but Weinstein
man
I would
put that
guy
in the
White
House
in a
hot
second
and I
would
breathe
a sigh
of relief
every
successive
moment
thereafter
I'm not
just here
to doom
sing
I want
us to
see
the
problem
so that
we can
begin
together
to understand
how to
reassemble
a vehicle
that can
float
in waters
like that
so that
we can
begin
to repair
in
resurrect
innovate
new ways
of knowing
and
ancient ways
of knowing
that have
allowed our
ancestors to
survive under
not entirely
dissimilar
circumstances
though
the degree
with which
we're experiencing
this at
present
I think
is unprecedented
in history
this is what
I think this
might be the
first year
that wasn't
a year
any time
relatively
modernly
you know
in say
the past
50 years
and yet
I didn't live
through World
War II
and that
must have
been
pretty similar
in a way
in many ways
it just
wasn't
the weird
thing about
our situation
is that
you can have
something worse
than World
War
that's going
on in your
mind
in our minds
and in our
relationships
right
you can
we can
experience
devastation
of our
interiority
and we
can even
experience
devastation
that deprives
us of
the faculties
with which
we would
detect
that devastation
is ensuing
and so then
what do we
have
right
well we
have 2024
in many
cases
the antidote
may actually
lie in
the children
which is
the voices
that we
never listen
to
and we
should give
those children
voices
in our
societies
in our
commercial
endeavors
we should
give them
prohibitive
voices
in our
military
endeavors
we should
depend on
them to
tell us
when not
to kill
each other
and the
grandmothers
and the
grandfathers
the elderly
these people
need voices
they also
need care
because
the elderly
are generally
just dismissed
evicted
they die
of loneliness
and lack
of meaningful
role
we need
to give
them roles
we need
to treasure
them
they are
precious
their knowledge
of history
the living
knowledge
of history
that they
are the
embodied
genius
of
is precious
now yes
it's also
true
that
as we
age
there is
an inclination
to
crystallize
into
ideological
concretism
I've seen
this in
many
what I
would refer
to as
older
persons
but that
may
be
a
side
effect
of
fear
and
isolation
and also
a
conservative
response
to
the
unprocessable
the
impossible
to
process
swarm
of
pathological
transformations
of
culture
society
location
gentrification
prison
eering
war
mongering
ideological
viruses
they might
just
be clamping
down
because
what the
hell
even is
the world
anymore
the future
does not
belong to
us
it belongs
to life
on earth
fundamentally
first
I mean
if we
could give
the whales
a voice
that would
be
the smartest
thing we
could possibly
do as
humans
the trees
the forests
the jungles
let's give
them a voice
or let's
take people
who have
become
their voices
and promote
those people
to positions
where they
have the
power to
prohibit
insanity
and that's
one of my
recommendations
about Eric
I'm sure
Eric doesn't
want the
job of
president
but I
suspect
that if
we could
actually
get him
nominated
you know
and we
elected him
he'd
probably be
willing to
sit
and if
he wouldn't
be willing
to sit
then he
should
sit
as an
advisor
to
whoever's
president
and we
should
enact
laws
that
make
that
force
the
leader
of our
country
to
take
intelligent
consulting
very
seriously
so they
just
can't
they can't
just
be a
one man
tyrant
you know
democracy
the possibilities
of democracy
fundamentally
depend on
the separation
of church
and state
and commerce
and state
those things
have to be
separated
whenever
those two
things
war
prison
eering
commerce
and religion
when those
in fact
a democracy
it's the end
of that democracy
and we don't
have one
anymore
we don't
have anything
resembling
a democracy
one of the
necessities
of a democracy
is a well
educated
populace
common
populace
we have the
opposite of that
on purpose
different factions
within different
parties went
after
the possibility
of free
and liberal
education
very
ferociously
over the
past 50
years
and very
successfully
yeah I don't
know what this
is but it's
not a year
and one
of the things
that's happening
is the past
the present
and the future
are collapsing
and this
does present
certain unique
opportunities
mad people
and prophetesses
and prophets
will certainly
arise in this
time
and some
of them
will
will
operationalize
the vortex
the temporal
vortex
and create
vehicles
in which
they and
perhaps their
followers
can ride
those currents
into what
power
hopefully
insight
and intelligence
communal
coherence
honesty
integrity
something we
might call
unlying
essentially
peeling back
the scabs
of
conceptual
ideological
social
political
commercial
military
falsehoods
that have
become
as profuse
and profligate
as they are
common
and trivial
and on every
tongue
and every
mind
popular
it's certainly
conceivable
that we can
engineer
antidotes
that are
more contagious
than pathogens
the real
stuff
and I mean
relational
cognitive
linguistic
ideological
political
commercial
antidotes
and if
we're to
survive
to whatever
degree
we may
have a
shot
at surviving
as a species
this is
the future
of our
people
once
attention
became
commoditized
our
civilizations
basically
slipped
nooses
around
each other's
neck
and began
winching
those things
up
toward the
sky
and
we're
still
at this
point
most
some of
us
are still
able
to breathe
those
who haven't
been executed
by the
process
so far
killed
either by
the disease
or the
cure
so to
speak
so those
of us
that are
still alive
I mean
you know
if
some of
us are
just
spectators
right
we're
just
kind of
here
to watch
the
apocalypses
mating with
each other
on the horizon
and producing
you know
little
baby
apocalypses
that are
going off
inside us
or replacing
our interiority
or our
potential
or our
future
and you
know
if your
life is
like that
REM
song
it's
the end
of the
world
as we
know it
you know
by all
means
pop
you know
pop a
beer
put some
music on
and
watch the
history and
future of
not just
the humans
but life
on earth
burned to
a cinder
I don't
really mean
that but
but really
I don't have
a lot of
judgment
about that
and
it's
sort of
if we
don't
produce
compelling
antidotes
together
then
at some
point we're
going to
lose the
capacity
to do
so
this is
like
Musk's
idea
and
Weinstein
half agrees
Musk thinks
we can get
off planet
to other
worlds
in the
solar
system
I think
that's
not
possible
I have
good reason
to believe
that humans
can't survive
metabolically
or cognitively
beyond the
Goldilocks
zone
long enough
to
undergo
genetic
modulation
modulation
that might
allow us
to exist
on
say for
example
Mars
I think
the only
chance of
us existing
on Mars
is if
we could
easily
travel back
and forth
from Mars
to the
Earth
that would
give us
the possibility
of surviving
the modulation
phases
I don't
think we
can survive
in space
I'd be
very surprised
if we
can
it's
conceivable
right
and Musk
has sort
of the
right idea
and Weinstein
is like
no we
need
we need
a new
physics
if
either
long
cosmic
distance
space travel
is impossible
there's just
no way
to do
that
at all
physically
I mean
I would
argue
that
it's
actually
the answer
to this
is accessible
to humans
right now
it has
nothing to
do with
traveling
in space
it has
to do
with
traveling
in
the
hyperlog
of
intelligence
that
space
time
is
the
what
the
hyperstasis
that
space
time
is
in the
same
way
like
my
body
is
to
my
as
my
hand
is
to
my
body
human
intelligences
to
space
time
we can
travel
we're born
for travel
in that
medium
that we
don't really
even have
ideas or
concepts about
unless they're
spiritual
primarily
which is
partly
confused
but anyway
weinstein
wants us
to
advance
physics
and find
the methods
that could
move us
instantaneously
to other
worlds
I think
we probably
still have
the same
problem
unless we
could produce
something
like
a field
inside a
vehicle
or a
building
that had
the same
properties
or
preserve
like could
remember
and preserve
the properties
of
our planet
and its
relationship
with our
sun
unless we
could do
that
I doubt
our bodies
or minds
could
could survive
it's possible
and you know
who cares
about Darren's
theories
but I'm just
trying to understand
what are the
actual potentials
and I'm not
close to other
arguments
I've had
conversations
about this
though
with
advanced
non-human
intelligences
and their
perspective
was
generally
I mean
they had
like 15
different
perspectives
but most
of them
agreed
that physical
travel in
space
for humans
is not
not a
thing
but what
I was
trying to
say is
similarly
you know
Musk is
concerned
that there's
a window
where we
might be
able to
get off
planet
and that
window
probably
won't
last
and
we have
the same
problem
with the
window
of producing
new forms
of communal
human
orientation
purpose
identity
there's a
window in
which
we can
pulling
that start
string on
my vocabulary
here
there's a
window in
which we
can
innovate
and we
can
because we
are free
right
we have
the luxury
of not
being on
fire
not being
struggling
for food
or oxygen
having
technology
at our
disposal
lethally
dangerous
though it
is
there's a
window
where we
can create
new ways
of being
human
together
that we
can actually
trust
and believe
in
and become
passionately
engaged
with
and in
case this
sounds impossible
just be
very clear
that it's
no problem
at all to do
this with two
people
three people
not a problem
do it right
now
instantly
accomplish it
without much
effort at all
a little bit
of you
know
a few
simple
agreements
and a little
bit of effort
and we can
get to a
superposition
over what
the common
people are
mired in
and
contributing
to
in seconds
right
so we
can build
the spaceship
of our
mutuality
so easily
in small
groups
all we have
to do
is build
a form
that becomes
contagious
and that's
not difficult
especially
when given
the alternatives
right
if somebody's
pointing 97
guns at your
head
and somebody
else raises
a gun
dissolving
flower
that flower
is going to
prosper
in the human
cognitium
very rapidly
not only
because the
humans don't
want to die
but because
the entire
planet's
history
and future
right now
is on the
chopping block
of the
idiocy
of the
humans
so you
don't just
have human
allies
you have
non-human
allies
you have
an ally
in the sun
you have
an ally
in time
space
you have
an ally
in everything
that is
in love
with and
relates
with the
earth
the entire
history
of life
on earth
becomes
your ally
all of
your ancestors
become
your ally
this is
exactly
what
superpower
means
this is
part of
the secret
message
underlying
our comic
book heroes
right
do something
so amazing
and beautiful
that the
entire history
and future
of life
or beings
agrees
and they
will join
your project
and lift
you above
your station
so this
is what
we must
learn
and remember
and recover
together
our more
than merely
human
faculties
relationships
abilities
potentials
intelligences
and we
were born
for this
this is
why we
came
in a
nearly
explicit
sense
this is
why we
came
to human
birth
it wasn't
to be
ground
up
by the
you know
the hamburger
making
nonsense
of culture
and language
ideology
politics
war
prison
hearing
discrimination
hatred
bigotry
sexism
and you know
a shout out
to the people
who want to
attack males
in general
and I see
these comments
on social
media
that are so
toxic
about
people just
attacking the
entire gender
of men
as if that
were intelligent
or a good
idea
I want to be
really clear
about something
that is
sexism
that is
bigotry
that is
hate
that is
stupid
that is
wrong
if there's
problems
with the
men
we need
to trace
them back
to their
origins
and heal
the men
pointing your
finger at
an entire
gender
and saying
bad
bad
gender
that's
just
stupid
and it's
going to
have
catastrophic
consequences
that will
not bring
a new
world
where
a new
way of
being
human
where we're
intelligent
and caring
together
with and
for each
other
and that's
what the
antidote
looks like
in my
view
up
symphony
symphony
action
in the
park
this is a
great
closure
for my
recording
today
when the
intelligences
from which
and for
which we
originate
are in
communal
agreement
our
abilities
are
infinite
oh my
goodness
music
all day
long
here
wow
okay
that's
awesome
we will
proceed
to discovery
and invention
experiment
and innovation
together
and if
if you find
this inspiring
get a couple
of people
together
and play
with the
possibilities
and the
infinite
depth
of the
intelligences
native to
our origin
and nature
as beings
as organisms
as animals
and as
human
you will
find
not just
an undiscovered
country
an undiscovered
universe of
potential
empirical
reality
is not
the limit
of what
is true
and
accessible
and the
delusions
of cults
are
a
distraction
from
the
beyond
that is
truly
accessible
to us
and for
which
we
ache
in our
souls
in our
spirits
in the
imperatives
that we
brought
to our
human
birth
and
recalled
in
childhood
and
perhaps
were somewhat
able to
preserve
however
despairing
we may
have
become
about
their
the
possibility
of fulfilling
them
in our
lifetime
so these
are some
of my
thoughts
for the
day
so grateful
to have
this time
with you
your attention
your concern
sign in
let me know
what brought
you here
today
and ask
a question
thank you
for joining
me
may your
paths
and lives
dreams
and relationships
be beautiful
adventurous
inspiring
and redemptive
peace for
now
more soon
