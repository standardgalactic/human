Alan and I used to do this thing where we'd take a popular piece of music or like anything, writing,
and we'd just re-translate it and gargle it into nonsense, complete nonsense, and then
we'd post it, or we'd like, we made videos with like robots reading it, we'd Google like auto-read
it, and then the idea was that every piece of media that has ever been created has been being
beamed to humans from space, but then the humans mistranslated it when they created it. So our
company existed, Textual Restorations, in order to go through and re-translate all of the texts
that humans had ever created into what it was originally supposed to be. And then we'd just
like go through, we'd just take like a Beatles song and be like, you know, like Eleanor Rigsby,
right? We did Eleanor Rigsby and be like, father, you know, father by Tuesday, do you think you'll
have those socks? Right? It was like the way that we would change that line. And we just changed it
into all like nonsense, but the like, dripping with like possible meaning, right? So people
would read it and they'd be like, wow, like thinking it's like some really avant-garde,
like weird fucking shit, and we're like, nah, it's just, no.
