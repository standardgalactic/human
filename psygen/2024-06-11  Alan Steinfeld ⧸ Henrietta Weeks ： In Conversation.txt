are you at are we are we discussing are you what are we doing there so um you know this may just
be sort of a precursor or an introductory uh conversation that we have here but i've long
been interested in having a good chunk of time with you alan because your your history and your
work and your mind are so fascinating so um just to introduce uh everybody here we've got henrietta
weeks alan steinfeld and myself uh darren stevenson um and uh you know ever since i first encountered
accidentally alan one of your videos it was a interview with a south american shaman
um and he was talking about the mirror gazing practices oh yeah sergio magana from mexico
yes yes the toltec yes exactly i came across this recording and i watched your interview with him
with great enthusiasm and fascinatingly within two days of watching that recording
i had the experience he was talking about i became aware in dreaming found myself on the roof of my
house i tried to do what he said what he recommended was if you can spin your perspective so that it
inverts what you're usually doing which is looking out into the world so his suggestion was that you look
you look back toward yourself from outside and of course he says that if you if you manage this you will
see that there's nothing there which i can't imagine what that experience would actually be like
he also said that if you can't manage that look look at your hands which is not an uncommon
suggestion from lucid dreamers of course i looked at my hands immediately i was flying it wasn't like
i had a body it wasn't like uh my normal identity or consciousness was there it was like i became flight
so i had this experience a couple of times and a few weeks later through the graces of henrietta
you showed up in a zoom call that we were having and i was like
oh wait that's the guy who was interviewing that guy who yeah you know had this immediate so few
things have such an immediate effect on me right so i was really profoundly impressed both
with the fact that you brought this person into my life you know you were the bridge that brought that
person into my life and then also you show up in my world you know shortly thereafter as if you know by
magic or or um what's that beautiful word that we use to describe a joyful coincidence um synchronicity
is it it's an even better one and it means oh i know what you mean i know yeah it's like a it's
a really poetic word yeah yeah we'll think of it so i'm so grateful just to even have a little bit of
your time alan um we've we've had conversations a few times before and i've been really blown away not
just by the breadth and depth and scope of your experience but also like your intelligence your
humanity how well read you are i mean you mentioned books that nobody knows about um you know with very
few exceptions so yeah i'm just i'm just super excited to even have a little bit to chat with you
here you turn me on to the uh master and the servant book by ian and that's a very important book because
it explains this fascination with channeling these people think they're channeling something but they're
really breaking down the walls between the left and right brain and then they think they're
channeling like you know someone from and there are channels but most people are not channeling anything
except their own right brain that's very interesting because it matches up with my own experience i'm um
i'm a bit allergic to what we might call woo on the other hand there are uh veritable
people there are people whose experiences are profound um you can tell the difference when
they're speaking most of the time perhaps not always speaking of smelling i just have to check
something on the stove yeah and darren i was going to say one of the things that alan
um told me recently was he you know he spent a lot of time with some of these
big names in the ufo field like john mac and bud hopkins so those i those are kind of really
interesting questions to ask him like what you know because john mac is like one of my favorites to
to sort of turn to from from that era because have you have you read some of mac's work how were you
used to mac huh how were you how did you discover mac through alan i mean alan introduced me to the
whole uh topic which was kind of a cool story actually because i went to see like alan and i
just became friends like you just instantly as soon as we met i was like i've known this guy forever
he's so incredibly friendly and open and we can talk about everything which is one of my favorite things
and doesn't happen that often in that way anyway i went to one of his panels on astrology in new york city
and and he was you know doing his doing what he does his moderating and he was great with this really
robust panel of astrologers but then he he kind of said this line this throwaway line of like well
you know the ufo phenomenon and alien abduction is the most sort of pressing question of our time
and then he carried on and i i thought like wait if alan is saying that like surely there's gotta be
something there i'm not looking at it like why aren't i really paying attention so then we began all
these conversations and alan and i had this strange experience when you know i hadn't known him that long
but i was sitting in his apartment there and we were talking intensely about the topic and if i felt
like i just fell into it but suddenly i was seeing like these triangles floating over his head um and i
still don't really know what that means but that happened it was just like there were lots of things
that kind of it felt like a tumbling into something well i still don't really understand much about it but
that did happen are kind of a signature of the phenomenon i mean you know when we say phenomena
ufo phenomena don't really know what we're talking but no one knows i've been researching that not the
government not the military not the experiencers not the researchers i mean i've been talking to
everyone intimately connected to this field have to say i'm writing this in my next book but i'll give
you this line it's what um arthur eddington said about einstein's theory do you know that famous line
my favorite of all to explain the ufo phenomena something we don't know is doing we don't know what
that explain that explains all we actually really understand about what's really going on a lot of
people talk about manipulation these days like we're being manipulated you know psychically visually uh
behavior but that's a human perspective is it manipulation i mean yes from a human perspective but
is it something else i don't know that's the question i mean we are being influenced but
you know i said this at contact in the desert recently it goes back to what einstein said
is the universe a friendly place and you know that's the question you have to answer for yourself
then if it is a friendly place and maybe we're getting assistance i believe it is a friendly place
look it's made it very comfortable for humans to be here so true you know in our in our media and such
we see catastrophic depictions of violence constantly right and yet in my actual life
admittedly a privileged and blessed life i've seen nearly no violence almost not people like
on intensity and i have a whole theory about the archons feeding off emotionality
um about the arconic uh invasion i'm just going to close my window to reduce the traffic noise for a
moment did you talk about that henrietta did did we no i mean i don't really look i don't know what
i think of all these sort of narratives really no it's just another narrative it doesn't mean anything
well the narratives are not meaningful until we use them with each other that's right either to help
us see together or to occlude our capacity to see together right to replace it with some uh
representation for example um my my roommate mike rezel was at contact in the desert uh
maybe i met him what what what does he do do you think um i will ask him uh and i'm going to be doing
some interviews with him as well he's he's been deeply enmeshed in the topic this is how he and i met
you know because i have a um you know in my own history i have a couple of profound non-ordinary
experiences yes them were um somewhat long-term but not continuous um and of course you know i'm happy
to answer questions but that's not what i'm here to talk about today alan um if i may just ask you a few
rather direct questions uh why don't i'm i'm an open book so tell me something about um your childhood
you growing up what was important to you what bothered you well yeah did i have one passions um
antipathies whatever you want to share good questions i think i would see figures out the window
going to sleep faces but maybe every child sees that um i did want to be an astronaut because that
was big when i was growing up everyone you know i actually had an astronaut helmet i think or maybe
was a football helmet um and then it's in my book if you read my book i start to become obsessed with
science fiction in sixth grade this is something we share yes right because it had the answers
you know had answers of parallel universes and life on mars or wherever other planet i mean it was
already thinking outside the box science fiction i mean there was one story where and this was a new
concept to like a 10 year old where people would project their consciousness into robot bodies and they'd
be able to walk around as robots with the consciousness their human conscience in these in these machine bodies
i mean that was that was the digby allen series and i think that's what it was that was that was
you know i still remember that that was 10 years old or something you know and i ordered those books i
don't know even know but it was a great series and you know these books i'm sort of synesthetic you know
so i get a feeling from colors or baseball teams would give me certain feelings like the yankees versus
mets or the giants i i i would feel it's not emotion i would feel a sensation uh also what would give me
sensation is um different car color colors on cars when they're real you got that too so interesting yes
when i was little yes did you ever see the light bright toys maybe i don't know those were almost
psychedelic right they they had these little pegs there's a black front piece right and you put these
little pegs in the front piece and they would shine with this incredible um perfect like these days we have
leds right but these were these were sort of like the leds of of our childhood right it was something
about the metallic um red and blue particularly when they're shiny and this i remember my father bought
a cadillac it was like with the fins this was like 19th and that was really like something from the
future too that was a feeling i don't get those feelings as much but i do can get it with colors
different color combinations like orange and blue or black and gold which happened to be by haskell colors
uh uh but they're not emotions they're just feeling sensations i don't it's a synesthetic thing so i don't
know what that means but i feel those vibrations that's very familiar to me and um you know uh my
the mothers and fathers of my mind were science fiction authors i've read thousands of science fiction
stories so that's funny that was how i was educated what do you remember what which ones are your
favorite i mean i read everything so first of all when i was before i was even in kindergarten my
parents read jewels burn to me so 20 000 leagues under the sea and i mean there's a there's a lot of
symbology here that i think people miss i'm sorry what were you gonna say oh i just said journey to the
center of the earth was really he didn't go far enough you know i think he was on to something and
then he censored himself because there's a whole civilization in the earth i'm pretty sure that he
probably knew it was also harris in the future do you ever read that jules verne's book no that one i
don't know a lot of things that happen i think you know he wrote in the 1800s he predicted paris in
1960 and a lot of it you know was remote viewed so you know there's some things people don't know
um i think that are important because especially lately i've been learning a lot more about the ancient
greeks and the mystery traditions and so forth particularly the relationship between um women
snakes and initiation right these three topics but mimosini the mother of the muses
captain nemo his name is clearly from this he's the protector of the oceans and the oceans are the
origins of life right they're the source of the possibility of memory he is a protector of the feminine
right and uh you know later my mother would become a feminist and i would go to now national
organization of women meetings in stockton in the 1970s and i would encounter the first actually
intelligent human beings that i would ever you know that would have a huge impact on my development
going forward that's good you remember that because i remember just reading learning to read
very stupid stupid books see jane ron and that with dick and jane
fun with dick and jane yeah but that put you the reading of those very childish books
create a framework for thinking which was unfortunate it's true there's an apocryphal
story where um you know not to blow my own horn here but blow it my kindergarten teacher invited my
mom she's like you know i gotta talk to you about darren and she tells my mom you know i'm sorry uh
mrs so-and-so but your son has a learning disability yeah and my mom is like okay you know how did you
figure that out and she said well darren's not paying any attention at all during the reading
you know segments of our class and my mom says to her what are you what are you reading and she's
you know she gives her the fun that literally the same book you're talking about fun with dick and jane
right see jane run my mom i feel sorry for my kindergarten teacher and kind of for my mom
my mom says you know darren's reading 2001 a space odyssey my husband and i are having trouble
understanding this book do you read any arthur c clark so i was already reading science fiction when
i was i was hyperlexic as a child should be we should read the sophisticated books when learning
to read that sets up like i always regretted not being able to study latin and greek in high school
because that sets a foundation yes and one thing about reading i remember i was picking up a book
and my mother said you know there's no pictures in that book i was just and i said i didn't say it but
i thought why do i need to see i create pictures in my mind with the words i don't need to see a picture
book i would every time i read i create those pictures so i mean my pictures are a lot better than
the pictures in the book with the so i mean in my mind so i remember that very clearly like
yeah i don't need pictures i have my own pictures like you know that's it reminds me of that line
from that humphrey bogart movie was it um the treasure of sierra madre he said um badges we don't need any
badges you're right anyway it's something um and you were very smart as a child what's your memory of
reading and learning to read um i read fairy tales um and also and my mother read me lots of like really
interesting stories that i remember being very dark and exciting like scary you know and um
yeah i was very very lucky i mean like you're saying i didn't want i loved pictures but i i
i certainly didn't need them after a while because like you say it was sort of limiting
yes so yeah but i really loved you know scary stories and and you know i loved roald dahl for
instance you know never read him but he was english so we didn't read him yeah just kind of mischievous
and dark but you know and then yeah and now it's interesting you know my my nephews for instance you
know they i don't know literature seems a little bit more kind of bland i mean i'm not quite sure
but that's you know i'm glad that i had access to all kinds of different texts yeah i really liked ray
bradbury myself as a child not isaac asimov he was not a oh really you didn't yeah very sophisticated
except one movie a one short story called the last question you ever read that book that short story
is that isaac asimov oh you know what i was talking about my childhood childhood yeah i mean later on
yeah i've read fairy tales and that did that set a kind of um structure of perception reading fairy tales
yeah and also not just uh it wasn't just um books but you know television in england in the 1970s was
kind of really interesting there are lots of good like science fiction-y type series you know obviously
there was doctor who but there were also these other ones that you know everything was quite was
hyper imaginative in the children's programs and sort of trippy and um it was just like
extraordinarily fun and wild that's what i remember about it like and joyous you know and scary
there were so many interesting films hammer house of horror you know which was so kind of bad but
they were so excited you know they were very simply done low budget imaginative the snow queen was my
favorite film which was half animation half reality based on it i think it's like an old swede uh nor
nordic myth the snow queen anyway no that's great no i that's that's why you're magical
you grew up with magic well i also just grew up you know we were so lucky i grew up like just running
around in the woods you know i mean that's what i did most of the time and often alone so it was like
you know my friends were the trees and the animals and the things that we made things that i made and
then i had friends too but it was like we spent all day outside in the woods on a bicycle
yeah that's good that's fun yes right yes so we were lucky because we didn't have phones
what's that darren so i'm curious if you had experiences in childhood that you would categorize
as out of the ordinary or that perhaps catalyzed oh by the way the word that i was looking for earlier
with serendipity that's it right serendipitous that i met you a few shortly after i first saw you
yeah so i'm curious if you have any recollection recollections from childhood of anything
non-ordinary that may have piqued your interest or made you curious or troubled you
well i do remember this i was very hyperactive it's a good thing i wasn't born later they would have put me
on drugs because i just had i could never you know like i guess if you're a child that your parents
like to put you in bed before it gets dark i could never go to bed before it gets dark so i'd be laying
in my bed i think i must have been two maybe three years old and sort how am i going to fall asleep so
i closed my eyes but i was looking with my eyes closed you know through the darkness staring into the
and then i started to see like this light this side this beam in my third eye i guess that's what it
was but i felt like i think i was like traveling along the light you know in as i mean it's a form of
meditation but i was doing it at two years old which i think gave me a sort of um um omniscient awareness
about reality it's kind of disconnect you know as i could step back and you know see the drama around
me because i had that inner space i thought there must be just as much of an infinite within as there
is out there you know people say the universe is infinite but i think where this little um
sheet this film between the infinite inner and the infinite outer and i i came to something like
that as a child that sort of like yes the other interesting thing i'm writing about this also in
my next book is um i remember looking at the television for the first time and everybody was
very excited but i didn't see anything on all i saw was this because it's black and white this kind
of gray fuzz there was nothing people were reacting to this i could not understand what they were seeing
and then suddenly i there was some movement on television that kind of matched the movement of
people in the room my family and friend and then when i correlated the patterns then these figures
started to appear on the television screen it's like i i i didn't see it until i uh used the correlate
pattern perception and then ever since i've been not obsessed with patterns but using patterns
because that's how the left right brain thinks through patterns of awareness and it's not
so patterns were and also opens up the artistic realm and all that so patterns were much more
interesting than in logic in a sense you know both hemispheres have a unique relationship with patterns
when um people experience paranoia or even uh certain forms of grandiosity that can have to do with the
left hemisphere getting spun up the right hemisphere has a much more uh be the right word sort of a
um an ambient awareness of relationships right like connotations rather than definitions associations right
i teach that in my remote viewing class like the left brain sees the trees the right brain sees the forest
there's also but please continue what are you going to say also what it's also a really fascinating
okay so so much that you said is really interesting here first of all i just want to highlight what you
said about the tv you were you were shown a technological stimulus right and it your your mind was not prepared
for the possibility of seeing images on a screen and correlating them with yeah i had no orientation for that
i had no i mean it wasn't even yeah it was just like natural like you know natives they talk about some
of the natives can't even see a black and white photograph they don't get it because it doesn't
make any sense how is it possible that the light shadows could be recorded on a flat like it doesn't
there's no such there's never been anything like that in all of nature it is not like our experience
of dreaming even though it may have a deleterious or uh influential effect on our dreaming when we are
exposed to this but one of the things i think is so important about what you shared is that children we
should be very cautious exposing our children to moving images on screens like that could be much more
dangerous than we've ever imagined and it might even be more dangerous now than it was historically
rather than you know oh well we've been evolving with this so that's such a beautiful that's exactly
the kind of thing i was hoping you might you know you might volunteer from your childhood that was
that was exquisite um there's so much more today earlier in the day i was talking with a really young
man he was talking about the greeks and how they thought about um perception and consciousness and
stuff and stuff and the things that you said tonight about your experience of closing your eyes
seeing the light traveling on that light many of the greek philosophers did not believe that we were
capable of perceiving reality because we are trapped in our human sort of structured sensorium
and one of the things that they thought was there was like a film like a superficial skin on things
that was deceptive and you mentioned this this concept and also the concept of seeing
you know you used the phrase third eye but of of seeing like with your eyes closed right right right
right seeing the inner world right i'm very visual it developed my visual no i would never i wasn't
drawn to muse i mean i like music but you know i i do like visuals that's more my entertaining art form is
to look as opposed to hear thing you know i mean music and all that but um yeah visuals are my key
into creativity you are you are primarily a visual rather than a tactile or auditory thinker
yes that's my main thing and um and loving what i see you know everything is just so
fascinating i mean you're such a warm spirit you're you it's you're really very unusual because
you're profoundly intellectual but you're just like this warm human heartful being thank you for saying
that it's a very uncommon mixture is it i think you know don't you think everyone's just like you i mean
i do i wish more people were like you i'll say that much i think everyone well you know of course we're
all different but um i don't know i think the prejudice of humans is to meet someone and say
until you get to know them of course they're similar to you they and then you realize that they're not
and then that's that's a whole other story there but fascinated with the world and um
stories and movies jack the giant killer i still remember that movie that was like somehow the movie
theater was crowded and and maybe i was five years old and i sat by myself
and this big screen and like it was this animation very primitive by today's standards but fantastic
um multi-dimensional kind of realities on the film screen and that was also another doorway into
the possible or the impossible
so do you have any memories from your childhood of non-ordinary experiences
that you'd be willing to share here yeah i mean well definitely in my dreaming you know i had very
interest well sort of strange recurring dreams um
um which i think you and i have talked about darren yes the past yeah and uh but it's interesting
listening to alan talk about how he was visual and he saw that light you know when he closed his eyes
for me i have to say um i must be a feeling person like i always had like uh sensations you know call
them intuitions if you like but that was kind of how i was understanding humans like wow you know why
are they talking this nonsense you know adults or wow this feels really good or this feels really dark
so it was definitely like i feel like i was this kind of sensing organism in that way um so i i did have
some experiences when i was a little older of um you know ghosts and visions i mean like you know i
saw well i could just tell you one of them i was 16 probably 16 17 and i was walking across a field
in england back from school to my mother's house it must have been about 10 at night i did that walk
every night across fields on the downs and out of nowhere appeared a white horse like
suddenly in my pathway and there was a fence and a bush so it didn't it couldn't it didn't come from
anywhere and because i didn't know what i was looking at other than it was a recognizable white
horse but i wasn't sure if it was real because it seemed to be glowing um and then we just kind of
stared at each other i don't know for how long and then it disappeared into the bush but it didn't go
anywhere like it should have come out the other side so you know that was definitely one of my
strangest experiences and then just because we were speaking about ufos i saw at the same kind of age
i saw um it was either three or five of them i can't remember exactly on a clear day
in the same place actually interestingly i just realized that it was like as i was walking the dog
up a road that was very clear to that exact spot i'd seen the white horse they were above
me and in the daytime in the daytime yeah a very ordinary day just walking the dog very clear blue
sky and then i saw these things in the sky that i thought were like planes you know doing in formation
which i'd seen before but then i realized that they weren't making a sound there was no sound and the way
they were moving was not recognizable to me like they weren't it wasn't they were going forward and
then backwards but rather than that thrust of reverse they just kind of went backwards and then down you
know like the movement made no sense to me at all and there was no sound and then they kind of
disappeared but i didn't know how they on like it wasn't like they went up they just well that part of
england is a very well known ufo spotting area right well no this that alum this was in west sussex which
i think is probably i don't know if it has many but the place where i grew up darren in england a place
near um manchester it was called preston and it was my stepfather was in the army and we lived very close
to this to the um military what do you call it ministry of defense headquarters like right next to
it um it turns out that that that's a very big ufo hot spot but that's where i spent my earliest years
um and that's when alan and i have discussed the dream the recurring dream that i used to have which
i think i've told you about before but you know perhaps that's for another time or later today
if you don't feel comfortable sharing about that right now that's okay well i do but i don't
okay i'd like to hear i'd like to hear what what you care to share okay so that recurring dream
which happened all the time between the ages of like um probably six and ten something like that
because at ten then i went to a another boarding school somewhere else so i wasn't there but it
was just um and i would have it quite often it would start by me i was lying in my bunk bed i would try
to turn on my light because i felt scared at this point i didn't know i was in a dream so what i would
do was if i was scared would i would turn on my light and i would read a book but in what would happen
is i would turn on my light and it wouldn't come on and then i would know that i was in a dream
right and and it was the recognizable dream and then i would hear these like footsteps around the
house and i knew that they would be coming in they would be entering the house and i was afraid so i
would go through to my mother and stepfather's bedroom and they they wouldn't be there the bed
was made up and my parents weren't in the bed so i was like alone in the house the footsteps were
surrounding there was all this commotion and then i would hear them come in and they would be searching
for me and at that point i would go and hide and try and try all these different hiding places and i'd be
kind of like running from room to room and then i would go and hide under my bunk bed and it would
be very cold and then the dream would always end when they would come in one of them would like look
under the bed that i could i have my back turned to them and it would end with i would always wake up
by this finger being run down my back from my neck to the base of my spine and i didn't know what that
was but it was just so incredibly like weird and creepy and that's when i would wake up and i just had
that dream all the time so those were the main features of the finger and the turning on the light
i think and then in between that it would be a variation of people running to find you know
coming into the house and taking me away and my parents not being in their bed it was made up as
if they'd never been there it was like there was nobody in the house anyway that's that was the
recurring so glad you shared that i don't know if you realize how um both unique in in in in
in its personal relationship to you that it is but also redolent with with classic themes of
the sort of liminal space in the between of i'm not fully asleep i'm not actually lucid um the attempt
to turn on the light i ask people questions about this all the time about their dreaming particularly i'll
run them through a series of questions have you ever seen the sun you've seen the moon have you
seen stars have you ever attempted to turn a light switch on what happened when you try to turn the
light switch on and you know i remember one one night i went to my girlfriend's house and she was
quite disturbed and she said you know i fell asleep and i woke up in the darkness and i went to turn the
light on and it wouldn't go on but the light wasn't off when i woke up and the room wasn't dark and she
was very confused and this was the first time that i'd ever heard someone do that and i hadn't had the
light switch experience myself yet which i have now and it's it's quite profound because sometimes
i'll go to turn the light on it doesn't go on and then i'll be like what so i go to get my flashlight
with me right and i'll try to turn that on and when they both don't go on then you know and almost
always after that something very non-ordinary energetically begins to occur aaron what's going on
is this uh et interaction you're feeling what what's going on you think um you know when when
gary nolan talks about his experience in the japanese hotel where he felt his whole body vibrating
i think he's just you know and i don't know what his experience was i'm not trying to say
you know i'm the expert here but i think he's not he's just not that familiar with the liminal states
right the hypnagogic state that comes between waking and sleep in which there's a variety of very
unusual phenomenon and the hypnopompic state which comes on the other side in which there's a
different usually variety of phenomena so i suspect that these are energetic states in which something
like our spirit or soul maybe we have multiple features of that are um normally they're synchronized
so we don't feel and experience that shift but if they desynchronize slightly we start to have
experience in those liminal states what do you think alan well that's good but i think there's an
external causation so it's not just all interiorly manifested i think it's an interaction with a
maybe it's a part of ourselves of course but it's it's an extraordinary presence i think there
that and that's what i think people are not and this is like really what i would like to get to in the
conversation people are not aware including maybe us this this force that's all around us that comes in and
out of reality is when there's an opening like in a liminal state it can act but most people are so
shut down you know in a bit that even if it acted they wouldn't notice it so um but i think that veil
between the dimensions is getting thinner and there's much more talk if you look at ufo twitter ufo reddit
about the phenomena ufo phenomena and paranormal that is an intersection greater than ever
and of course no one can explain it because no one can explain the paranormal no one can so but we're
seeing that i mean that's really the beginning of if you read skinwalkers at the pentagon
that's why lakovsky went to skinwalker to understand the relationship between ufos and the paranormal
because that was a paranormal spot and and i think i mean i think the paranormal is a ridiculous word for
something that is in a way always here you know in other words it's not supernatural it's natural please
continue yes i just wanted can i ask you a question darren and alan because what this makes me think
you know you're talking about this to to me i have this sense obviously not a knowledge but just this
sense that it's like it's very much it's just a part of our mind and the the whole thing that is
just becoming more um you know i want to say alan's talking about veils like less concealed from us from
right that and it's kind of it's almost like it's sort of slipping in
um i mean the only thing that i find that i can't i find really difficult to think about is
why do it why does it seem like we're looking at hard physical objects in the sky that's interesting
because that's different to like dream states and what you're talking about liminal states alan um darren
no a lot about why are there if they're it's all consciousness why are there hard physical objects
and that's the question like what is that but they're in the world but not of the world so i think um
they can get caught in 3d but they they don't exist here in that way but they come in and out of this
dimension and they solidify but we're the same if we look at who we really are with the bodies
that's not really who we are right so right like somehow they've mastered this ability of the of
collapsing the wave function into form and not collapsing it i have a whole theory darren about
how to think like a et which which is not collapsing the wave function so you can stay in two places at
once right um remain in superposition exactly i have a very similar perspective and i think um what we see
in what what we probably see in the sky first of all what are um you know what are ufos well it's not
one thing right and and you know in our us moderns we have this sort of one thing mind oh it's this oh
that's yeah yeah it's that that's whatever things might be they it's never that simple unless it's something
unless our concern is very trivial right is this a glass or not of course you know it works there
but in terms of phenomena it doesn't work that kind of thinking just doesn't work at all
there's probably 9 000 different things and there's like spectra of different things but um
you know the greeks believed that we have a secondary form that they call the soma pneumatica the spectral body
and the mystery traditions were uh were catalysts for producing this kind of experience in us
and possibly actually in producing a death experience so that we like completely get outside
the human for a moment i don't know um but what i'm trying to say is that i think there's a range of
phenomena some of them might be relatively similar to just actual vehicles you know like this is a
physical vehicle possibly from another planet some of that some of the spectrum might be that yes
i think there's a there's a unfortunately there's a really weird correlation between
ufos gods angels archons yes titans right um all of these there's a there's a correlation i'm not
saying they're the same thing i'm saying they're related and it's complex problematically the way we
moderns think the way we use categories is insufficient in my view yes to encompass these phenomena or to
um to shed light upon to illuminate them to our thought what are your thoughts alan
just our whole structure of reality has to be reformatted
we are paranormal in the sense that we create the realities around us you know so um i mean people
have said that and it's you create the you know william james said we walk in a atmosphere of our own
creation you know you also coined the term stream of consciousness william james he was and he was a
he was uh totally into psychic phenomena too so and he was also the father of american psychology so he
had all this stuff do you know um jonathan jonathan brickland henrietta from the open center no i don't
should visit him he wrote a great book about william james it was quite the visionary and you know
he's the one who said other forms of reality exist right around us and apply the right stimulation and
they appear so he he experimented with psychedelics you know he nitrous oxide was really big in the 1890s and
he would experiment with that and and go into these other worlds now it's dmt but maybe it's all the
same thing i bring that up because yes well recently i've experimented with much smaller amounts of
psychedelics um psilocybin specifically where that was really interesting being able to slip between i don't
know very like different channels whereas if you kind of blast off then that's a whole a whole other
encounter with reality but a lot happens for me personally like which is not about my personal
psychology or it doesn't seem to be which is interesting it used to be but now it's kind of like
whole other worlds that i do not recognize like yeah that's where we're
with microdoses with what with microdoses henrietta no not microdoses um this was like for instance
this was just one gram as opposed to three or you know 2.5 it was a very different experience
um i wanted to say something about you were talking about the structure of reality oh yeah
like could it could it be that just you know if we are becoming right if everything is still in a stage
of becoming something like the ufo is like darren says i love thinking about it in terms of like it's
9 000 different ways of becoming so we we're just kind of feeling our way there but i alan and i this summer
darren were in england together and we were talking about crop circles right because we're both really
interested in that and um where i live in england it's quite a hot spot for those and one appeared the
next day like five minutes from my house so alan and i got in the car and we like went up there and
and we were able to kind of go and explore this particular one um and this farmer we met a very
down-to-earth farmer who just kind of we were lucky enough to meet him and he said yeah you know i can
show you some on my phone from like four years ago from last year and he was like i have no idea what
they are but i i don't think that some of them are man-made they're just like it's impossible this was this
guy who was you know he had no like real interest it was just they happened to keep appearing on his
land and that was how he was interested you know right alan it's it was like a very interesting thing
and darren i want to tell you too that this field that it appeared in was right in front of this 5 000
year old um burial site which is called a long barrow in england so that was interesting see this
is the other weird thing is that there are places on the earth yes that are not regular places that's
exactly it and also once you build cities and stuff on top of things yes something up like there's a whole
there's a whole topic here that we could explore yes ancient places in europe are not regular places
and this is an important idea because we as moderns we think we know what stuff is and we think we know
you know what the universe is what the world is what's supposed to happen and blah blah when the frank
truth is we're dealing with less than 0.05 percent like not even one percent our knowledge is so wildly
incomplete and so fundamentally malforged by ideas from science and religion yes um but alan there's
so i have so many questions i want to ask you and this doesn't have to be the last conversation but
there's i've got like some burning questions can i just throw a few at you yeah yeah yeah yeah i have
yeah let's go till 11 on well at least underneath all right yeah i mean we can reconvene another time
soon hopefully as well i like this conversation because i appreciate your intelligence and of
course i love talking to henrietta so yes i'm loving this conversation it's like it's a lot of new ways
of thinking about things actually it's yeah go ahead darren so i want to actually you know i'm not just
here to um to pay you endless compliments but it's hard not to one of the weird things about alan is that
there are people who who make claims you know that they're like psychic or they're powerful or
something but one of the weird things about alan is that there is this natural serendipity and you
know one of the things that occurs to me is that he has been a central like like a honeybee that's
visited you know 10 000 flowers right and just gathered this pollen from all of these brilliant minds and
spiritual you know powerful spiritual beings i mean he's interviewed some of the castinated witches
and i i don't even i can't even imagine what his life and mine must be like but i want to just ask
you alan if there's one or two standout stories where you met someone and immediately either in
the meeting or shortly thereafter something very dramatic occurred that that you can remember are
did you have any stories like that it's lipton um i i can't say i discovered him but no one knew him
because he was living in northern california and you know who bruce lipton is i know his name say more
about him please he um was really uh bringing spirit back into biology he's an anti-darwinian he says darwin
darwin darwin never explained anything darwin doesn't explain how one species becomes another
species adaptation yes i mean that's but speciesization darwin had no idea and i don't think many people do
have i have my own theory about why um but the thing that um bruce lipton said which was a sort of um
epiphany for him is that um you know well there's many that you have to listen to my interview with
them but there are single cells right and everything was a single cell at the beginning of time and then
you know a cell perceives the environment based on the receptor sites on the membrane
so he says the membrane is really the brain of the cell not not the nucleus he says that's a sex organ
which is where most people think their brains are but but the perceptual organ in the in the cell
yeah and the nucleus is just to reproduce so um uh the survival depends on how big your awareness is
right i mean the more awareness is the better your chances of survival so the membrane can hold only so
many receptor sites and there's this is bruce lipton there's a receptor site for everything in your
environment so the receptor site for uh maybe that organism or this so you know when the cells only
move they have one two two options to move towards something which is food to move away from something
that could be harmful and we still sort of function on that kind of cellular level um but so if a cell can
only have so much awareness based on their membrane size too big a membrane will not hold all the cellulose
in there to break apart so what the cells did through the genius of nature was hook up with another cell
and they say you look that way i'll look this way and they formed colonies of cells but they weren't organisms
yet something magical happened when one cell hooked up with another cell and then they started to share
awareness and boom they became an organism like all the cells in your body are are all individual
consciousness but they're forming what this is bruce lipton's term the synergy of awareness
so they're all coming together to make this focal point all the cells in your body trillions of cells
or billions at least are coming together to form the synergy of awareness for you darren and henrietta
so the synergy of awareness is the key to evolution so the synergy of awareness and he says that's where we are
what we are in the human drama we still think we're separate beings um walking around our own individual
thing and he says we are not humans until we create humanity that's when we all come together realize we're
all part of this bigger super organism called humanity then we have a singularity of voice
not the kurzweil singularity but the singularity of consciousness where we form a synergy of awareness
yeah all your cells are still separate but they're all formed so the synergy of awareness of the super
organism we're calling humanity will eventually realize we're all connected when that happens
this is lipton we form a oneness that allows us to meet other onenesses this is the ufo situation
then we form the next level of super organism where we link consciousnesses earth human conscious
with these other consciousnesses to form the next super organism um intergalactic awareness or whatever
that is that that i thought was very interesting doesn't that isn't that interesting oh i mean you're
you're right in my i mean there's a reason why my website is is organelle.org and it's not an accident
it's it's basically about cellular synergy not only it's it's also the metaphor you know we have organelles
in our cells right that used to be separate organisms right our solar system is not entirely dissimilar
right it has sort of a nucleus it has these organelles one of them is packed with biological organisms
um i want to ask you alan do you do you think that the other planets might be inhabited by something
other than organisms has this concept ever been exposed to you
what do you mean other than organisms wouldn't it be organisms as opposed to other organisms
yeah what i'm asking you is um you know i've heard for example uh a theory that there's layers there's
like dimensional layers yeah and in different layers the other planets are inhabited
yeah this is a rudolph steiner kind of idea if you ever look at steiner okay uh-huh that's true
from planet to planet and evolve certain um certain uh perceptions emotional perception i mean earth
is like the emotional but you know but it's sort of sorry but i think there are just beings on other
planets that you know living their own reality but i do think and no one ever talks about this with et's
that the um david anderson you know who he is he's a time traveler or talked about time travel he says the
speed of the earth the rotation the earth forms a a matrix of time space so we live in a particular
framework of consciousness that's based on that's why astronauts have such a weird time
when they go in outer space because they're outside the the incubation of the mother's um perceptual field
so it's it's each and each sun i also think has a has a uh pattern of consciousness like a template
what like a template yeah a vibrational it's like the sun or the star of your system sets your um
sets the uh mode of your consciousness field so meeting beings from another star it's like
i i talk about it like how do you get wi-fi on an am radio it's like it's a different vibration
so that's sort of my understanding it would also be like the children of two different stars meeting
and so through those children those two stars are meeting right yeah because yes um but we have the
capacity because we're infinite and of course consciousness which i teach in the remote viewing
class is not local consciousness this thing where is not local to earth but it's um um calibrated
through the earth frequency but it's also infinite if we break outside right henrianna yeah well no i
just wanted to tell a quick story if i went to this festival with alan this summer in england he was
speaking there and he did this remote viewing experiment and um what was interesting to me was
well i i got it right which was like so it just kind of happened but then the only other person that
got it in quite a large room was the girl sitting right next to me yes whole thing of like the membrane
i don't know would that that be a thing it was just interesting it was like we both had the same image
and it sort of came in in the same way because we talked about it um and then it was a slightly
different way that it formed out but you know we got we got it yeah consciousness is very influential
it's a it's a you know i also talk this another theory of mine darren that um consciousness is an app
it's an application and people don't realize they just think it is what they are but it's an app
that you can use and i said this and oh you too bad you weren't at contact in the desert
because i talked i i hosted the remote viewing panel and i said if so if you imagine you remember the
1950s 60s the core the what the there were phones that had cords on you know wired phone everyone grew
up with them even remember the dial and no answer yet phone in the 1950s 60 40s 50s 60s 70s maybe 80s
but if i came to that time and said you know i have a phone where i can watch television i can make uh
you know i could see people around the world i could you know i could buy things online i mean
if if i said that they would not understand how a phone that you just talk to people could possibly
do those other things they haven't explored the application of the phone just like we have not
explored the application of consciousness we just think it's a line hooked to the wall but these
other beings you know they can come into your dreams they could no merge with their craft they could
move through time and space they've learned to use consciousness as an app and we
read to the wall that's that's the difference that's beautiful and that's amazing ellen i really like
that yeah that's a that's a wonderful toy and i'm sorry go ahead say more better here because it was
like i had thought about that and then in front of like you know a couple hundred people i was trying
to communicate this but i'm i'm fine tuning it right here so thank you beautiful it's fantastic that's
very good right how could you think about it how could you explain what a phone in 2024 could do to
someone using a phone in 1960. there's framework what are you talking about using all those things
that's how far behind we are in the application of consciousness okay what would they make of this
exactly make sense to them yeah how could you possibly call anyone i know um a few more questions
so so i want to get back to the question i asked you previously and and i have so many more but of all
the people you interviewed was there someone who either produced an immediate unexpected effect or shortly
after meeting them you were either frightened or astonished well like i said with bruce lipton when
he made and i'll go to other people too but when he said we'll only meet the other ones once we become
the one it's like oh that makes sense it's like that fuzz on the television it's like that it's like the fuzz
that you saw on the television it wasn't integrated exactly yes very good that's good darren that's good
you're absolutely right yes so it's um but nasim harmeen another genius you know he's amazing yeah
talked about astrophysicist right yeah you know nasim yes i i i do from new york i remember putting a talk
on everything there's a black hole the universe is actually a black hole the whole universe itself
but also the smallest edge of that black hole is the plank's constant because that's as small as we can
see but inside that there's another black hole but inside every atom is a black hole he says there's no
strong and weak forces that's just a fudge factor there's only gravity and electromagnetism and they're
really effects of mass interacting with other masses so um but he says so there's no weak force and
strong force what's holding the um the atom together is that implosion factor you know that pulling together
and uh that's why atom bombs when you pull these atoms apart creates such a huge thing because there's
such a strong force holding matter together that's this black hole sort of in the center of atom then
you're ripping that apart you know you're just creating this massive chain reaction i mean that he
doesn't quite say that but inside atoms inside every cell there's a black hole inside every human you know
where the black hole is in humans i could guess you guess behind the umbilicus i would say it's more in
the heart because that's what gets the heart beating all the time that force and there's black holes in
the center of every star there's black hole in the center of every galaxy which you see it's obvious you know
that you know and i there's one more thing the missing the dark energy and dark matter
sort of is also another fudge factor they're just not calculating the real weight and mass of black
holes which are doorways into other dimensions so they don't even know what that is so anyway what
were you going to say henrietta oh i just wanted to say about the black hole just briefly because i'm a
person that sort of feels things without really understanding intellectually sometimes the black
hole thing when i've been around people that have slightly sociopathic or i've discovered they are
i always get the feeling of the black hole is right where you said it uh darren like right there
in that sort of like gut womb you know that area it's like there's nothing there
that could be yeah um there could be there could be different kinds yes totally totally um alan i just
wanted to ask you to just when you mentioned nasim haramein and so it's interesting that you've you
know you've pulled those two people out but i want to take you back to darren's original question
because i'm really curious like he is about amount you know all the thousand hundreds and thousands of
people you've met and interviewed and also just met and been curious about because darren allen is
a person that will just talk to anybody at any time and get and have really fascinating conversations
like they don't have to be famous and well known and they've written this book they're just like a
kid on the street you know that's interesting to me more so in a way but so alan i wanted to bring
you back to that question of like see just what comes to you naturally is like these really
um like darren said you know these really visceral experiences that kind of resonated afterwards
and let me say one more thing yeah not theories yes exactly what what shocked you what was like
lightning what did you meet someone and then like a few days later you're in contact with another
intelligence i want to hear like if there was what's the mount everest of your experience i have to say
say 1981 i saw my first channel like jay-z knight ramtha you know that ramtha story and you know
channeling no one talked about channeling in 1981 and this was a woman who channeled so she claimed a
35 year old war 35 000 year old warrior from atlantis and she would go into a trance and the war and
ramtha the warrior from atlantis would come through and i thought like one of three things of course she's
probably acting or she's psychotic you know those two or or maybe maybe maybe maybe maybe perhaps
this is really going on so i i heard a tape of ramtha and in this tape just to kind of get used to like
this woman was at you know people ask all sorts of ridiculous questions like what they should do
about their cat anyway this one was about her skin she had this like skin problem and she tried
everything you know and um she didn't know what to do anymore because it would just flare up and ramtha
says to her have you tried loving it and you could see there was a gasp it's like i haven't thought of
that it's like so i thought well maybe also this could be about love so i went to around the audience
it was october 1981 central park west 75th street right next to the cyclical center in new york actually
it was right from the dakota um but it's 81. um anyway i'm in the audience with ramtha people asking some
questions and it's about 100 people or something and then he calls on me and he says to and i'm
sitting in the back he says what say you beloved entity how be you this day in your time and like
that was the kind of language shakespearean and i looked around and um you know there was no one behind
me and i said me goes indeed beloved entity you'd be a most good entity and then then what happened was
that the room started to get i would say misty or like a fog or or distorted somehow and i felt as if
i was coming out of my body something's coming out of the ramp this body from this and we sort of
embraced in the room uh in the middle of that room and energetically and then then i knew then i knew
there was more than the physical reality then i knew like that was a door opening into the realms
of metaphysics then you know and i said well maybe there's something to do this i'm going to look at
this if there's nothing to it it'll just be you know empty nothing to see there and then you know
i started to read metaphysical books or three initiates the kabbalion and once you open that door
there's no side because it is a deep deep well and that was the awakening to this that was the beginning
of the journey right there right then in october right there and um yeah you can't go back out and
say it's not real because it is real so and i have to say ramtha was the initiator
mm-hmm jay-z knight who's who i saw recently out of contact in the desert she was waiting
i was on the stage she's waving at me and i said who's this woman waving at me i said oh jay-z hi
judith knight is her jews anyway i know her whole story and she was waving at me from the stage i used
to be waving at her a real like full circle sort of thing and that was like oh wow it only took about
20 years 40 years maybe whatever it was like yeah that was sort of a like like a whole completion of
a thing or not completion but it was just very strange that she was in the audience and i was on
the stage from and it's because of her in a sense i was on the stage that's great open the door and
you know i have to also say my father was very spiritual oh yeah i like this i was just thinking
about your early childhood and your spiritual experiences and what your father was and introduced
you too yeah father gave me permission because he was interested in but he was also a tourist and he
grew up poor in depression he had to make money and he because he was sort of a searcher seeker
like oh it's okay to be that way because my father's into it it's like that was a role good role model you
know i never really had a lot of people have problems with their fathers and i had more problems
with my mother my father my father was um no he worked hard he made money what was your spiritual
practice together what would you do well when he got ill we would go to michio kushi institute we'd eat
rice for five days you know with um different healers um he was into zen zazen
when he was starting to open up to um you know higher consciousness so he would go to this little
i always thought zen and and buddhism was very very boring you know what about his did was he interested
in kabbalah that wasn't like really it was very much orthodox judaism there really was
at his time he started a little bit to become interested but it wasn't really a thing if you
were brought up kind of orthodox and you it wasn't a spirituality about judaism i ask you a question
about you know because i mean this is a bigger conversation but just very briefly like do you
think that you you were talking about you were talking about latin and greek you know and learning that
as kids and how it'd be a good idea do you think that hebrew as a language was influential in your
well i said latin and greek because language of the intellectual you know it's that's that's what drew
me to latin and greek because it's but i do think and i have a whole like cosmology about um civilizations
where um you know the the greco-roman influence kind of merged with the judeo-christian and that became
the manifestation of western consciousness so i do think the judaism influenced the christianity but
also had an influence on some of the greek and um anyway right there in alexandria is where it all came
together i think basically with gnosticism so i think its foundation is beauty but of course the
foundation of judaism was er babylonian and you know abraham abraham may have been a brahman a brahman
that could have come from you know and the whole idea of worshiping a single god which isn't really true
because they talk about the elohim which is a plural of god you know i don't know elohim i am so
el is a singular elohim is the gods so you know there's a lot of um strange things that is never
explained in judaism that is much more mystical and i think kabbalah is one i think if you read carlos
suarez oh you should read carlos suarez when you come back to my apartment he's a real portuguese mystic
um i like him henriette he's very smart um i like him yeah he's he's a whole different he's really
mystical but anyway judaism hebrew it's not the it's the maybe the spiritual language of the west
foundational bit it's not the intellectual language right that's my thing that's yeah interesting but
greek it greek is the foundation of western thought in a sense there's a lot of um controversy recently
about whether or not the torah ever existed in hebrew before it existed in greek in terms of her being
written at all no what about the there's all these dead sea scrolls there's all these buried torahs um
i mean i think it must no because the hebrew language is sort of the torah no i think the torah
no i think it's an ancient tradition they just don't last that long because they're written on sheepskin and
sheepskin probably doesn't last for thousands of years you know but yeah then was translated into
greek into latin into english so um to return to the question other stories of something that really
deeply affected you your initiation was very powerful story but other stories that affected me like that
well with people meetings with people right that that really influenced you or produced an unsurprising
result around the thing i think is the most dramatic for me because that was a that was a moment of
shifting reality that was um you know seeing ufos um what was the first experience of that
oh i was actually in new york city like um and it was after i think the simon and garfunkel concert
and i was walking home down sixth street henrietta and i saw a light in the sky and it looked like it
admitted a blue beam i thought to myself did i just see a blue beam come out of this thing it did it again
so strange but uh and then in my book i talk all about meeting this woman jane and sedona and our
travels together and how we were both abducted together and i did feel what i met her in sedona
at a workshop called laugh your way to ascension and i felt her as she walked into the room but she was
with a friend i wasn't sure who i was feeling in the room that had walked by and kind of stimulated my
aura but after i met them both i figured out oh okay it's this one and then i think we're both taking
a board together and um you know she we traveled around after meeting her in sedona we traveled we
drove back cross country where i think it was in north platte nebraska that abduction took place
my abduction where there was a mark on the back of my leg and it's interesting it's the same leg
that's been bothering me henrietta i think it may have been of the etheric implant from back then
aaron do you know do you know quite a lot about these strange marks that appear on people i wouldn't
call myself an expert um i've followed the topic since i was a child oh you have yeah so you know yeah
aaron have you been taken a whole no but i had a long experience of contact with a non-human
intelligence that was so yes my whole the intelligence you you see in me today is the
result of that yes and if that's how i was first drawn to to your work dan i mean just because it's
like who is this this is like doesn't sound like a human it's too intelligent i want to interview you
about that darren okay absolutely i i would love that and and i and i want to have more conversations
like this one in the very near future like like within the next week or two um okay where were we
going here so um so the answer henrietta is no i have known a few people who spoke of having implants
i am familiar with the topic i have read a bit about it but i don't know like i don't know anyone i've known
a couple of people who you know directly said there's something under my skin or there was
something in my yes which is very interesting right i mean a good friend of mine just kind of who who is
very very intuitive she's an amazing singer she sings like an angel she just she had a very strange
like scar thing that just appeared on her wrist one morning but she also has very extraordinary dreams
you know where her father comes to visit her her dead father so she's very she has a lot of non-ordinary
experiences and so i was curious about that mark that appeared because i'd read so much of that in
the uf the abduction literature that always seems like honestly i'm so kind of i don't know if skeptical
is the world but word but i can't it's like i just don't know how to begin thinking about it you know
well there's there's topics that are so unusual that we don't know how to vet the reports that's
right so we can't tell like how do i even tell the difference between the stuff that's real or that's
you know relatively important and then there's there's so there's two real problems here one is
madness and delusion actually there is such a such a thing sure yes alan will be back in a moment
okay so madness and delusion actually do happen right and it doesn't mean that they're wrong yeah
there's nothing valuable in there it just means that there's it's scramble the yes you can't necessarily
trust the surface story that's right i've known people who went out of their minds i've had very
close very close friends who were schizophrenic or psychotic yes me too had moments of my own
consciousness where i am i've become disoriented um in what i'm paying attention to and why i'm paying
attention that's a good way of putting it yeah and so often what happens at least what has happened with me
is that my threat sentinel lights up and that is so powerful that it warps my cognition around it
that's that's such a good way of putting it actually i remember talking to you about that but that's a
good way so i've had experiences of that so there is madness and delusion on the one hand then we have
objective fact which is what we get from empirical quote unquote pursuits of mankind which are very
weird by the way if you know we should talk at some point about just how strange the idea of
empirical reality is because it's very very weird it's much weirder than well you know we did the
test 500 times with 500 people and the same thing happened every time right okay great but what portion
of reality does that refer to like less than a thousandth of one percent or something that's that's
right and then you know what you were saying about your friend henrietta that i think is very important
because it cued me into something and in conversations like this there there's something
very powerful happening that resembles what alan was talking about when the cells come together and
form a singularity right now we can all see better because of the brightness of each of our minds and our
hearts and our history and our passions right yes that's real magic as far as i'm concerned yes there's one
very strange thing if there were a dimension of our ordinary lives in which we could safely interact
with other realities and other intelligences it's obviously dreaming you say your friend has unusual
dreaming experiences she wakes up with something you know in her wrist or whatever manifest yeah how
you know why do we think that okay we have the same problem with dreaming that we have ufos
yes those things might be actually just relatively ordinary dreams yes but the whole range of experience
isn't ordinary not by a long shot that's right yeah we should help each other think more intelligently
about these topics and experiences and potentials for the much more than merely human that we are
and can be together well you know who talks about this in a good way is although i don't agree with a lot of
it is donald hoffman saying that space and time objective subjective these are illusions these are not
realities there is no subject object there is no time and space or fabrications they don't really exist
they only exist they only exist in the mind that creates them but there's no there's no time or space
in the reality of consciousness basically he doesn't say that but i say that so
uh fabrications of frameworks but there's no essence of themselves
yes oh darren i have a question for you have you seen a ufo have you seen things yes i thought so
yes twice but i wouldn't say that what i saw the first time what i saw is probably more properly
called a fireball oh yeah yeah yeah i've i've also um spoken to friends who've experienced those
things it lit up it lit up the night sky about four times brighter than daylight and i believed
immediately that someone had detonated a nuke so i just thought oh we're dead it's over my friend's
on the other side of the tree he's like swearing he's looking toward it i'm looking away from it
it was nuts it was crazy i've seen some other very weird things that were explained away as rocket
launches but certainly didn't look like a rocket launch to me and then very recently i saw a um
a configuration of white flying objects in the sky over stockton and i pointed out to my son like
what the hell is that he's like i don't know you know the only conceivable explanation i have for
that sighting was that it could possibly be drones in a formation oh yeah possibly but uh i don't know
what that was and i also had a weird feeling when i was looking at it oh that's interesting yeah yeah
and it is interesting you know i loved what you said uh henrietta when you were talking about your
experience with a ufo um because you said it wasn't making any noise exactly but but but there's
something even weirder than that which is that many ufos seem to cause a form of silence
right oh what's the phenomenon you know a good friend of mine who saw one when she was a child
with her father he was like a judge right in westchester county before they had the experience
of seeing this huge ship the size of a football field actually come down into like this shaped her
whole life but her father who was excited for about two weeks and then completely banished it from his
mind but before it all before they saw that they were driving in the car and they heard a noise that
was high-pitched and like nothing they'd ever heard which caused him to like pull over to the side of
the road because it was freaky so i i don't know i'm just interested in like there's always on it on
every level there are silent ufos but they also make these sounds and they also light and sound are a big
part of the ufo activity look at any abduction report it always involves um so uh yeah this it
it's a complex phenomenon it's not ever the same for two people but um anyway i should go soon but
darren i do want to hear about your you're looking much better too and you look much happier than
you did last time you do you do you look healthy and i'm actually just so i'm absolutely elated to
be having this conversation together with you all like this is the a very high point in my world and
i'm super excited well and also let's hope it leads to more like really soon i would love to
hear you both speak about things a lot more i'd like to be able to ask you both questions actually
how are you doing henrietta how's portland oh it's great i love it it's beautiful bursting with beauty
and sunshine and i'm it's lovely to see my friend who's writing the most fascinating book
about what well she's a criminal lawyer and she works on you know um clemency
petitions to get prisoners out of prison who are wrongly convicted so there's a lot of like
extraordinary stories of you know what happens to these people inside and just it's amazing and and
how and how it's affected her and her relationships so she is an actual human angel no i know that's
well that's why i'm interested yeah she's an actual what she's doing you know and in the context of her
life so this book is going to be amazing because it's kind of her life of where she goes from point
you know beginning to now and how weird world in england which i know because we were kids together
we've known each other since we were children to this you know how she's actually doing this in
portland like she's got out more prisoners in portland than ever in the history of how long will you be
there um just another week or so on this particular journey this leg i'm going to the prison soon with
her i'm super excited to meet some people and kind of go into an environment which i don't know and i
want to are you staying with me when you come back do you need a place um thank you so much no i'm i'm
good because i'll go back to brooklyn but i'll definitely see you we're going to hang out obviously
let's go upstate too let's go to hudson yes we're going to visit my friend mary mary is the friend
darren that saw the ufo as a kid yeah and she's really wonderful i want to say this actually
about like this is an interesting part of the phenomena to for me like it does seem to activate
possibly a lot more of sort of a of a lot of different intelligences or sensitivities or whatever
you want to say you know mary's an amazing painter and it's but she seems to to draw people to her
through her immense kindness and you know way of like intuition and she reckons what she said to me
about that experience i knew once that had happened that life was just unknowable like we didn't know
anything that's exciting yeah whereas her father was so freaked out he was excited for a minute and then
he was like he just pretended it never happened i have to go but okay thanks thank you alan i presume
i have your permission to uh command post our conversation posting it yes yes i look a little
weird i'm laying down you know it's like oh alan you you look great and you said great things it was
very interesting what both of you said yeah i mean i just feel a little weird about my okay but yeah
where do you post it on my youtube channel all right i mean i guess it's fine do you okay alan you look
great there's no weirdness there it's not like you're in your bathrobe i want to make sure everybody's
comfortable so we'll discuss it respectful i'm pushing him because i'm his friend much more respectful
than i all right i'm saying that what you said was so good it would be a shame not to share it
yes okay okay great see you guys much love seeing you very soon
