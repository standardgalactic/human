Hello, everybody. Welcome.
I've been listening to Danny Jones interviewing Neil from NOSA Conformant.
I can't recall his last name at the moment.
Like, Senyak, Sendlak, something like this.
Fairly interesting.
And this is obviously one of the things that's going on with Danny's podcast at the moment, Concrete.
Is that clearly he's exploring the world around Amon Hillman.
And Neil has a lot of interesting historical perspective and information.
He, Neil, is an autodidact.
He was not educated like me.
He's a self-educating person.
He follows his passions and his interests.
And he became interested in these topics through what he called studying his way out of Christianity.
Which is a very interesting thing to say.
And there's a lot of good information.
Neil is very supportive of Amon's classicism.
Amon, his Greek scholarship.
And one of the things that Neil says is that most of the people that are attacking Amon's perspectives, I will call them,
just basically attack it from the place of, well, no, the, you know, the, the, the agreed upon knowledge, right?
The, um, what's he call it?
Consensus.
Consensus.
By the way, that's basically just like saying with the numbers, with the census.
And this is the ad popula, ad populus rhetorical fallacy.
Well, most people think, who gives a flying poop storm what most people think?
Like, let's be really clear, if we go with generalities and generalizations, we're not only going to miss everything important.
Because what will be overlooked is everything that, everything that opposes popular consensus.
And in our situation with the moderns, the educational level of the common people, if we take, you know, if we, um, how would I put this?
If we adulterate the pool with the entire scope of the numbers, we're going to find, and we've got to include people who are so old their memory doesn't work yet.
We also have to include children and stuff who have no formal education to speak of, or not much, yet.
So, if we dilute the numbers with the common people, what you get is basically just stupidity.
Like, bald, bold, inveterate ignorance.
Which you can see, very commonly in the United States, in our political situation.
You have two species of catastrophic stupidity.
You know, assembling golems in public to war against each other, for the sake of what?
It has nothing to do with running a country, I'll put it that way.
It has a lot to do with lining pockets,
and
sustaining lineages
exchanges of socio-political, economic, war, prison, you know, power.
Backroom power exchanges.
The currying of favor and favor trading, and so on, which is the opposite of what a democracy should be about.
But, in any case, one of the things that was bothering me is that both Neil and Danny,
with all due respect,
Danny is catastrophically naive
about anything relating to spirituality.
I'm pretty sure he's an atheist.
And
it's,
you know, Danny asks Neil if he's religious, and he just says anything but.
So, Neil
is also,
hopefully my wind buffer is going to work here, I did test it a bit.
So, Neil is also,
what?
I'm not going to, I'm not going to say he's an atheist.
As far as I can tell,
he's anti-metaphysical.
He doesn't believe
there's anything like souls,
or spirits, or gods, or
daimons, or angels, or anything.
And,
you know, I'm reminded of
experts on fishing
who've never held a rod.
Right?
And this analogy turns out to be really important here,
in all kinds of ways.
They've never seen a fish.
They live in the desert.
They don't believe in fishes.
Fishes are a story
that crazy people tell.
And the crazy people
are so insane
that
these desert dwellers,
and these aren't like the Bedouins
who actually have wisdom and stuff.
These are idiots.
These are people who live in a world of their own suppositions.
Having no experience
of the things that they speak of.
This is what I was talking about in my
recording about knowledge and writing,
and the problem that that produces.
It also produces amazing
possibilities of learning
and the exchange of
the transfer of knowledge
on a broader scope
than person to person
by song and oral tradition and transfer.
That's true.
It does do that.
But it comes with very lethal dangers
and historically,
the humans tend to ignore
the dangers of their new technologies.
And then,
what happens is
the structures of power,
the
understructure,
the sort of malignant understructures
of power and wealth
and rape
and torture
and lying
and, you know,
not the good kind of lying.
Not the aurea.
No, no.
The kind of lying that leads to the
immiseration of
thousands or millions of people
over epochs of time.
That kind of lying.
This all gets supported by this process.
So,
what we have here are people,
you know,
I can't really speak much about
Danny Jones
and it's not my intent to insult him
or to be disrespectful,
but it's clear by,
just from listening to him,
he sounds like an 11-year-old kid
knowing absolutely nothing about the topic.
And look,
he's interviewed a good,
I don't know what his numbers are,
but a good probably,
you know,
500 or 1,000 people.
Very deep minds,
you know,
very rich intelligences.
Strangely,
his own intellect
appears largely immune
to these intelligences.
and I find it tragic.
This is the problem with the claim of knowledge,
right?
These people are talking,
I don't care what they believe,
and they're welcome to believe whatever they like
or disbelieve whatever they like.
They're talking about things they have no experience of.
Just like people in the desert
who make up stories
and say,
you know,
there's people who say,
there's these people in the West,
right?
And they say that you can go to the end of the world
and if you go there,
you will see the great water
that fills the whole horizon.
Those people are insane.
It's not possible for there to be great waters like that.
There's no chance of it being true.
water as far as you can see to the horizon
all the way around you.
Those people are doing,
those are drunkards and silly people.
They're just making shit up,
right?
Which is effectively what they're saying.
They're saying,
you know,
Neil studies
the origins of religion,
we might call it.
And he's an interesting cat
and he has a lot of
name-based,
date-based,
place-based.
You know,
he's got this sort of,
like you see on those detective shows,
right?
Where you,
there's a wall
where all of the
sort of major players
and situations
and the timeline is there
and there's a web of red threads
between all the stuff.
You know,
Neil's mind is a bit like this,
which is super cool.
I mean,
for all it's worth
in terms of trying to understand
classicism.
What happened in the ancient world?
How did,
where did we get,
you know,
did the Masoretic text
come before the Greek
Septuagint
Septuagint
or vice versa
and why
and so forth?
And,
um,
Neil's defending
Amun
primarily by saying
that his detractors
cite
consensus.
Well,
the consensus is,
obviously,
that
Masoretic text
precedes the Greek.
But when you look
at the actual numbers,
at least,
um,
from
some of the people
that Neil has been interviewing,
some of whom are
lifelong scholars
of these matters.
These are not
trivial idiots,
you know,
who,
these aren't political theorists,
okay,
who,
I think,
you know,
nope,
it's nothing like that.
These are people
who've spent
their entire lifetime
studying
in
the archives
and in universities
and all around the world.
Some of them
probably even
in the Vatican libraries,
um,
which must be
catastrophically
astonishing.
Um,
many of these people
think
that we should
ask questions
about the texts.
and their origins.
So,
he's defending
some of what
Amun is saying.
Um,
and also
by saying
that the people
who are trying,
you know,
by saying
that the people
who are trying
to refute Amun
are not citing much.
They're really just saying,
well,
the consensus
has long been.
Uh,
particularly
if you see
on YouTube
there's some
ridiculously
titled video,
uh,
Amun Hillman
debunked.
Wow,
what a load
of bullshit
that is.
There's no
debunking of Amun.
First of all,
you can't debunk
a human being.
Let's just be
really clear.
Amun Hillman
exists.
So,
you know,
the text
is already
stupidifyingly,
uh,
the video
is already
stupidifyingly
titled
just insane.
You can't
debunk
a human being.
Amun Hillman
debunked.
What are you
debunking?
You're debunking
your own
intelligence
in language.
Uh,
so what you
can debunk
is a claim,
not a human being.
It's purely
clear about that.
That little
ten minute video,
can't recall,
don't even care
to recall,
the name
of the guy
who,
obviously a friend
of Dan McClellan's,
who,
uh,
has
his panties
in a bunch
about Hillman,
and I would argue
doesn't even
understand,
has no chance
of understanding
what Hillman's
doing,
because what
Hillman is doing
isn't
history of religion.
It's related.
It's related.
And it,
it,
it,
it has an
influence in that
domain.
But what Hillman's
doing is,
what Hillman's doing
is magical.
It's not scholarly.
There's features
of it that are
academic and scholarly.
He's drawing on
his education
as a classicist
and his fascinations,
um,
particularly with
ancient Greek,
Galen,
Nones,
others.
Um,
everywhere
there's these
machines,
even in the park,
in the gardens,
driving machines
around.
In any case,
um,
what Hillman
is doing
is initiatory.
It's,
he's time
traveling.
He's,
it's like he's
opening up
a window
to a lost
world
inside himself.
He's opening up
this window,
this portal,
if you will,
and he's
transporting us
back.
He's giving us
a,
must be,
must be a word
for this,
where you're,
where you are
in time
is flipped
around and
exchanged
for another
place in time.
that's what
Hillman
is up to
in his,
um,
paramaniacal
dissertations
on the Bible
and the origin,
the actual
origins
of what's
in the Bible,
particularly
the New Testament,
but not merely
that.
And,
you know,
Hillman's
been accused
of various
kinds of
nefarious
activities.
I don't
know
what the
verity
of those
activities
might be.
Um,
you know,
basically,
he was
specifically
accused,
apparently,
by some
feature of
the Catholic
Church
of summoning
demons
and,
quote,
opening
portals,
unquote.
Which,
yeah,
he's definitely
opening portals.
And if he's
summoning
demons,
it's not
the thing
like,
oh,
Beelzebub,
you know,
come give me
power.
That's not
what's going
on at all.
He's trying
to understand.
He's trying
to see
what the
origins of
the often
absurdly
ridiculous
things we
believe in
modernity.
How did
we get
this stupid?
He's trying
to understand
the history
of these
situations,
which are
mysteries.
And when
he uses
the word
history,
he doesn't
mean a record
of what
happened.
He means
to inquire
of those
with actual
knowledge.
Intimate
knowledge.
The kind
of knowledge
you have
of your
lover's
mouth when
you kiss
them.
That kind
of knowledge.
The kind
of knowledge
you have
of a fruit
when you
eat it.
That kind
of knowledge.
Direct,
somatic,
visceral,
spiritual,
originary
experience.
Not thinking,
not opinions,
not ideas,
and he
doesn't give
a flying
fuck about
consensus.
Nothing.
Does not
care.
In fact,
he will
blatantly
declare
that this
consensus
thing
is
completely
delusional.
Nothing
there at
all.
he often
yells,
he will
yell out
everything
you think,
all those
thoughts you
have,
all those
ideas,
all the
stuff you've
been taught,
all of
that nonsense.
And then
he'll go
off camera
and you'll
hear spanking
sounds.
now look,
nobody has
to
authorize
Hillman.
You don't
have to
bow to
him.
He's not
running around
saying,
worship me,
I am the
truth and
the light.
What he's
saying is,
if you want
a taste
of the
ancient world,
that's much
more like
what was
almost
certainly
going on
than what
you've been
told,
we will
go together
using the
ancient Greek
as a vehicle
of travel.
Travel in
what?
Travel
in
pneumaticon,
in the
freens.
travel in
the
strands,
the
threads,
the
tributaries
of our
own
origins,
our
minds,
our
consciousness,
our
awareness,
our
souls,
the
spectral
body,
the
soma
pneumaticon
of the
Greeks.
He will
spin that
up and
take us
far
beyond
anything
we've
ever
been
exposed
to.
For
those
who
want
to
go.
It's
an
opt-in
thing.
He's
not
telling
the
world
what
to
believe
or
the
scholars,
but
he
will
openly
laugh
at
them
and
piss
in
their
faces
happily,
joyfully,
playfully,
because
what
they've
been
trained
to
think.
They're
doing
the
same
kind
of
thing
that
they
like
to
accuse
him
of.
They're
very
selectively
picking
certain
senses
of
certain
words
that
match
up
not
with
history,
not
with
the
consensus
of
primary
sources,
which
consensus
Hillman
may
well
authorize.
No,
they
are
doing
the
same
thing.
They're
excluding
what
they
don't
want
to
hear.
Quote,
why did
Hillman
have to
exclude
all
references
to
recreational
drugs
from his
dissertation
when
the use
of drugs
by the
Romans
was
probably
the
primary
focus
of
his
PhD
dissertation.
Why
was he
told to
exclude
these?
Because
it was
said
by the
gatekeepers
of
the
institution
the
Romans
would
not
do
this.
What?
What?
The
Romans
were
doing
this.
Of
course
they
were
doing
this.
We
do
this.
Every
people
who
have
ever
lived
have
done
this.
And
what
is
this?
We
use
intoxicants
and
sometimes
psychedelics
and
other
sedatives
and
other
things.
And
not
all
of
us
but
if
you
experience
anesthesia
in
the
surgery
this
is
what
he's
talking
about.
So
his
detractors
are doing
the same
thing.
They're
promoting
specific
senses
of
words
in
Greek
and
or
Hebrew
and
they
are
ignoring
the
senses
that
don't
agree
with
their
pre-existing
narratives
and
biases
many
of
which
are
ridiculously
what's
the right
word
McDonnell-ized
Jack
in the
Bible
eyes
so
frankly
I
think
it's
weird
when
people
like
Danny
opine
on
religious
topics
or
metaphysical
topics.
If
Danny
has
I don't
know
his
whole
history
I don't
pay a lot
of
attention
to him
but
if he
has
any
direct
experience
of
metaphysical
the world
outside what
you are
thinking
with your
representational
cognition
which let's
face it
is 99%
of the
universe
I mean
.999
right
like
basically
everything
isn't
what you
like to
think
is the
truth
of reality
you know
of what
that which
is
we might
call it
all that
is
and
Danny's
over there
trying to
think his
way through
that
good luck
Dan
you're
using
the
fingernail
of your
pinky
for
something
that needs
to become
the palm
of your
hand
and
replace
your
representational
cognition
for you
to understand
it
in other
words
you know
they're
literally
arguing
about
people
being
possessed
and
laughing
about
it
him
and
Neil
neither
of whom
apparently
believe
in
possession
which I
think
is hilarious
because
clearly
Amun
it
seems
very clear
to me
and I'd
love to
ask him
questions
about this
but
if
Amun
himself
has not
experienced
various
kinds
of
possession
particularly
by his
muse
the
dead
girl
he talks
about
when he
says
he has
a cheat
in
the
sacred
in
the
podcast
by
the
sacred
speaks
when he
talks about
this dead
girl
who
resurrects
the ancients
before him
one by
one
so that
he may
inquire
directly
of them
if he's
not
experiencing
something
resembling
possession
I'd love
to know
what it
is
that he
is
experiencing
and
these
two
young
men
who
know
nothing
of what
they're
talking
about
apparently
and by
the way
you know
you can
disbelieve
something
to such
a degree
that it
either
kills you
or blinds
you
right
in the
same way
that you
can
believe
something
to such
a degree
that it
kills
you
or blinds
you
you
can
disbelieve
that food
is
nourishing
and die
of indonation
right
you can
disbelieve
that you
need
water
you don't
need
water
dead
you know
34 days
later
if not
sooner
you can
say
there's no
objective
evidence
for love
that's just
something
people made
up to
amuse
themselves
okay
you won't
have any
experience
of love
there are
certain
features
of being
human
and I
would argue
that many
if not
most of
the features
of being
human
are like
this
where
if you
decide
that they
don't
exist
you become
incapable
of participating
in them
right
and unless
something
comes
and
overwhelms
your
your
your
blatant
ignorance
your
it's a word
I'm looking
for that I
can't quite
fine
unless
something
comes
and just
overwhelms
you
right
and takes
you over
which by
the way
is pretty
much
and I'm
not recommending
the use of
psychedelic drugs
here but
that's what
happens when
one does
psychedelic drugs
you don't
either
nothing
happens
which is
what happened
to me the
first eight
or nine
times I
smoked weed
nothing
nothing
happened
similarly
my friend
Alan Steinfeld
when we were
talking the
other day
he was like
you know
the first
time I
looked at
a television
it was
just
incoherent
I
couldn't
tell
what the
hell that
was or
what was
going on
there
and he's
right
it's because
the form
of our
cognition
this idea
that
the crazy
people have
that what
your mind
reveals to
you is
what exists
and what
it doesn't
reveal doesn't
exist
that is
impossible
there's no
chance of
that being
true
because what
actually happens
is that the
mind reforges
its own
anatomy
in order
to reveal
or occlude
features
of potential
relation
history
future
possibility
and if
the mind
has never
taken on
a particular
form
before
it doesn't
know what
to do
with the
information
and so
it may
generate
literally
it may
just knock
you out
I've had
direct
experience
of this
with things
that other
people think
are completely
ordinary
and happen
all the
time
your first
experience
of eating
food
with your
mouth
that wasn't
just milk
was probably
like this
your first
experience
of standing
up
was like
this
my first
experiences
of relation
you know
erotic
relation
with women
in my
teens
were so
like this
that it
was like
going to
another
universe
so this
idea that
you're the
arbiter of
identity
function
situation
circumstance
and you
just declare
you know
what's
happening
and what
isn't
you can
go ahead
and play
the game
of consciousness
that way
Neil
Danny
go ahead
be my guest
you're going
to miss out
on most
of what it
means to be
human
and from
your weird
little
isolated
castle
or your
dungeon
of naivete
you're going
to make
ex cathedra
declarations
that you
think
other people
are just
either having
us on
or they're
good actors
I mean
this is what
the left
hemisphere
would say
about everything
that it
doesn't
originate
grip
control
and also
anything that
would threaten
its supremacy
and consciousness
and by the
left hemisphere
what do I
really mean
I don't
mean
the left
cerebral
hemisphere
what I mean
is certain
features
that we
know
have an
intimate
relation
with that
hemisphere
from having
done experiments
with stroke
victims and
from having
done the
water test
where we
anesthetize
one of the
hemispheres
and we ask
the person
questions
and we can
talk to them
later about
their experiences
and so forth
we know
that
there are
faculties
from which
there are
faculties that
representational
cognition relies
fundamentally upon
and these
faculties are
tyrannical
you can see
them in
actual
tyrants
you can see
them all
spun up
in people
like
Mr. Trump
and other
tyrannical
nightmarish
folks from
history
who
probably need
not be
named here
so there's
this aspect
again it's
like the
fingernail
on your
pinky
or the
tip of
your pinky
screaming at
the rest of
the hand
you don't
exist
I have
never seen
a ghost
there's no
such thing
as possession
I mean
that's the
hilarious irony
is these
people who
say there's
no such
thing as
possession
okay really
because you
are possessed
by an array
of faculties
that are
declaring that
and you
are unaware
of your
possession
and think
that what
you have
is the
antithesis
or opposite
of possession
when there's
no chance
that's true
no chance
the irony
here is
ten miles
thick
you're
possessed
by a
tiny little
array
of your
cognitive
faculties
a little
tiny island
an archipelago
in consciousness
and that
archipelago
is saying
anything that's
not from
around here
doesn't exist
those other
islands
have ocean
stuff like
that's
nothing
it's not
there
there's
no
boatman
boats
are a
fantasy
dreaming
thing
you know
someone
very close
to me
last night
was arguing
fiercely
that romantic
love was
just an
invention
made up
by poets
you know
that everyone
decided was a
good idea
afterwards
he's not
entirely
wrong
but neither
is he
correct
because
the mind
can reforge
its anatomy
and under
some
circumstances
that can
be
extrinsically
not exactly
forced
but very
forcefully
catalyzed
right
and so
this is
really important
to understand
if you
are a person
like Danny
or Neil
who thinks
they know
things about
what it means
to be human
what's real
and what's
not real
you don't
you're wrong
you're using
you're using
the point
it's like
you're using
one book
in a library
or one
angle
of a sphere
to determine
what is true
real good
veritable
trustworthy
and so forth
you know
Alan Steinfeld
who I recently
did a beginning
interview with
spoke about
his first experience
with a trance
channel
and he
said in the
interview
you know
I met
this man
and I thought
okay
either
A
he is
psychotic
B
he's a
really
really
good actor
or C
and this
is
this is
the voice
of the
left
hemispheres
incredible
doubt
and skepticism
or C
maybe
maybe
maybe
maybe
maybe
maybe
he said
maybe
like
12 times
maybe
maybe
maybe
maybe
maybe
maybe
there's
something
going on
here
that I
don't
understand
and then
later
Alan
was
Alan's
a very
intelligent
well-educated
person
and then
so
so
then later
he was at
a performance
where this
actually I can't
remember if
I think it's a
woman who is
the channel
and she
channels an
ancient warrior
his name is
something like
Rompha
something like
this I can't
it was very
this channel
was very
famous
one of the
first
trans channels
he was at
a performance
the
the channel
picked him
out of the
audience
pointed at
him
he very
reluctantly
so I said
you mean me
right like
are you talking
to me
and the channel
said yes
in very
elaborate
ancient
pre-Shakespearean
English
yes my
beloved
you
and Alan
had a full
on suddenly
very rapidly
the whole
tableau
changed
he said
that the
theater filled
with a kind
of
I'm paraphrasing
here like a
glowing mist
and he rose
kind of out of
his body
and they
embraced
and he had
this experience
unlike anything
he'd ever had
before
and you know
you can argue
whatever you like
it's hypnosis
you know
blah blah
I wasn't there
I didn't see that
it's just hearsay
go ahead
be my guest
right
you can argue
the same thing
about the flavor
of food
right
the experience
you're not seeing
red
that's just
you know
blah blah blah
make up any
noises you like
you can make
all the face
noises you want
and you can have
all of the
critical
left hemispheric
refutations
be my guest
you're welcome
to have them
you're wrong
you're just
dead wrong
you're missing
the thing you're
using to determine
what is real
is only useful
in a very
very tiny
scope
of
human
experience
nature
being
thought
awareness
consciousness
all these things
very tiny scope
it's very useful
if you want to tell
is that pot
hot or cold
very useful
there
you know
how many coins
are in my pocket
very useful
there
beyond its
applicable scope
that
those faculties
are lethal
to understanding
they crucify it
they basically
just
you know
rip out its organs
and spray them
on the wall
so if you think
that you know
what's going on
based on your
rationality
you not only
don't know
what's going on
you're like a bird
that thinks
only this one feather
on my wing
on my
you know
on my left wing
or in this case
my right wing
because birds are
similarly lateralized
to us
only this one feather
can I trust
which guess
what that means
that means
that you will
never fly
and you're
a bird
you're born
to be skyborn
right
you're born
for the
the wind
to just lift
you up
right
into the atmosphere
into the sunlight
in
to
to dance
with the clouds
this is what
you're born for
and you're really
focused on this
one feather
and you're like
well I've never
seen anything
you're inclined
me to believe
blah-ba-dee-blah
blah-ba-dee-blah
okay
good luck
and everybody's
you know
lots of us
start out there
the problem is
some of us
finish there
and I have
my own biases
and perspectives
I too
can
I've experienced
delusion
I've also
experienced
manic insight
mantic
insight
paranoia
grandiosity
yes yes
I've had
these experiences
and of course
we want to be
protected from them
we don't want to
we don't want
our buffers
so permeable
that anything
gets in
and that's part
of why
rationality
reigns
supreme
is because
we're really
afraid of
the
the contagion
of madness
okay
I get it
but there's
other approaches
that allow us
to explore
our nature
our origin
our intelligences
our creativity
our participatory
transcendence
and this is
very crucial
that we have
these experiences
so we
we need a
buffer
against
you know
having the
membrane
completely ruined
by nonsense
which is
conceivable
but we still
need a
trustworthy
worthy and worthy
array
of incitements
maps
teachers
mentors
and perhaps
daimons
to lead us
you know
out of
the prison
nearing cage
of mere
rationality
that's it
for now
more soon
thank you for
joining me
may your
paths be
beautiful
and your
relationships
loving
and your
dreams
amazing
bye bye
for now
