so I'm here today with my friend Tyler who I've come to know through a unique
series of historical accidents and this is Darren Stevenson I'm really excited
to have a chance to talk with Tyler one-on-one it's the first time we've
had this kind of conversation or this opportunity our previous contacts have
been through email and on the extinction audio meetings so yeah Tyler I'm so glad
to have you here today really excited to have a chance to talk together yeah
likewise so I'm curious I'd like to know more about how we came to know each
other because I think there's a backstory here that possibly I don't even know
that might involve you somehow becoming aware of my work so yeah tell me tell me
anything you've got how did you come to be aware of me I discovered your channel at
some point about two years ago and I shared your information or your channel
with the extinction audio at some point they contacted you and then I was
informed of their involvement with you last summer yeah I see yeah I remember
them reaching out to me and there's a rather strange backstory there where so Sophie
mentioned Sophie reaches out to me and mentions both the June Institute which I
was the alpha initiate of I was the first person on that scene and then in
apparently in your desiderata by Hugh there's a segment where there's a bunch of
glyphs and those glyphs come from an anomalous situation in 2007 in the San
Francisco Bay Area that was later known as the carrot C-A-R-E-T drone or the Isaac
slash carrot drone and those glyphs I was the first person to what to make a chart of all of
the glyphs and build the forms that a font could be generated from I didn't
actually generate that font but my work was probably involved in generating that
font so I thought that was a really unique uh-huh set of coincidences I wasn't
clear whether or not someone in the extinction audio was aware of my involvement
with the Eugene Institute or not but so yeah that then I reached out to them a few
weeks passed and I ended up in a meeting but you and I didn't I don't think I
heard your voice until maybe what six or seven months ago I could be wrong about
that what's your what's your recollection we met around Christmas that was my
first encounter yeah please continue well until then I had only been watching the
extinction audio meetings so I only been a direct participant around that time oh I
see so you had not been directly participating in the extinction audio
meetings until that time is that correct yes oh wow okay mm-hmm and was my
showing up in some way catalytic yeah once I realized that you were a member of the
group I wanted to yeah I remember my first the first time I so so one of the
reasons we're having this conversation is that I've been reading Tyler's posts to
the group which are private you know they're sort of in the email chat and there
is a reddit channel but it's not particularly active and a few months ago we
began to play with the idea of doing what we refer to as missions which are
really experiments and Tyler had proposed a mission involving Goethe's how
should I put this good get his theories about light and the spectrum utilizing
prisms and I participated in that experiment but I remember I just remember like the
first few times I heard you speak I was pretty shocked at the breadth and depth of
your intellect your curiosity your passion your capacity to resist what we might call
prevalent biases in science and physics and I also I kind of heard this other
not sure what to call it an undertone a kind of urgency in your pursuit of
understanding awareness and particularly insight and so that's that's how we got
here today the last conversation that I was involved with with you you were really
just blowing my mind and you know I've been around it's pretty difficult to
surprise me but you don't seem to have too much trouble doing that and I'm you
know I'm totally hoping that that some of that might be going on today so yeah I was
just really enthusiastic about getting your voice out into the world and also just
having you know some open conversations outside of the outside the purview of the
extinctionality so yeah really excited about this this chance to begin that process today and hopefully
we'll this will just be a sort of introduction to future discussions and elucidations all right so I
do have some questions for you I'd like you if you're willing to share anything about your childhood and
your education that you think might have led you that might have been important in your development that
led you to the pursuit of awareness and insight and understanding and in case that's not specific enough
particularly anything that was highly motivating or anything that was troubling in such a way that it set you
on a quest and of course you know since this is public obviously you don't want to share
everything that's personal but anything you might want to share about that would be helpful
mm-hmm well when I was a child I was motivated to engage in certain kinds of ritualistic behaviors which I
think tied into my later intellectual pursuits you know when I was a child I was interested in
how my breath interacted with my environment and I became fixated on how my motion through space
affected the course of history in a more general sense a very vague sense and through that kind of
meditation or concentration I found myself almost entranced I could I could enter certain
kinds of like hypnotic states which I found extremely enthralling and invigorating those sensations I
think were like obsessions or almost like narcotics I became addicted to this feeling of
being ejected from historical time in a certain sense and as I grew up as my my mind developed those initially
physiological fixations became much more linguistic or intellectual so today I almost exclusively read aloud to
myself I need to feel the reverberation of my voice in my throat in order to absorb the information that I
you know conjure up so so even today my intellectual activity is still somewhat rooted in this more
primitive you know physiological experience that I had when I was a child so I find that interesting
like I can I can notice that about myself you know this very profound I'm sorry please continue oh just
this kind of progressive transformation of like this initially kinesthetic experience into a linguistic or
intellectual experience that transformation characterized my development I think as a person
so I can mention that and something about that is obviously magical or even esoteric yeah I notice
immediately there's a few things that are very clear to me one is that you're when you speak your voice is
very compelling your vocal music is consistent rich there is a sense of it being controlled I'm not sure
exactly what I mean by that but right yeah you don't range over a broad array of tones there's a sort of
intentional focus in a specific I think the word is timbre mm-hmm and your speech is that also the cadence is
consistent and it's compelling without being in that's the right word it's compelling without using volume or
transitions in tone to achieve the momentum or the the transfer of energy is actually a clearer way of saying that and I was impressed by that immediately when I first heard you speak
I think because I tend to be sensitive to vocal music and people's vocal rhythms and cadences and the whole range of their vocal behavior and yours is quite peculiar and fairly in like it's intensely effective if that makes sense
right yeah so I mean this is also generally how I read to myself I try to maintain this kind of consistent cadence I find myself conscious of my breathing the way that my breath moves through my mouth the pressure that my tongue exerts on you know the roof of my mouth and so on
these are features of somatic experience that are often remarked upon in specific traditions of meditation which I suspect you are aware of
like Hindu meditations meditation invite of Adanta
as careful awareness of breath specific places in the body where the breath can be felt particularly at the openings of the nostrils back of the throat top of the mouth you know one of the things that I'm reminded of by what you were just sharing which I think is super I mean it's extremely fascinating and I have a lot more questions about it
is that we are now in our modern time we're starting to hear a lot of very skillful and experienced people talking about somatic intelligences right like the visceral senses of being human and the nonverbal aspects of our human intelligence and when you describe your experience as a child
which must have been extremely confusing for your parents and we're going to get to that in a moment I'm reminded of somebody who is born with an intense connection to the somatic and visceral intelligences of your body and linking these to your intellect your awareness
and your motivations so I'd love to hear anything you'd like to like if you'd like to give us a little picture of something that might have happened in your room when you're not being observed by others and you were playing or practicing with these faculties
what would what would what would it be like what what did you experience and what might someone else observe
so I found myself typically observing some scene in my room concentrating on the arrangement of the objects
of the objects
in relation to my own body and its movement
I would feel this kind of energy accumulate in my body like a certain kind of tension
and I would kind of retain that tension as long as possible or to the most optimal point
for it to be released so this kind of release of energy felt like a form of chaos or a certain kind of explosion
so I would often like explosively like move my my hand in a certain direction
I would feel myself overcome by this kind of
involuntary purely physical process almost like an automaton
I would simply observe my own movement through space almost like a work of art
so I I almost externalized my motion becoming a kind of second observer
through this kind of process of becoming entranced if that makes any sense
so I guess it looked like a certain kind of vacillation between stillness and an explosion
so these kinds of violent explosive chaotic movements
would preoccupy me if I was just kind of
you know sitting by myself in my room
even something like a pencil on the desk
you know I would concentrate on the pencil study its position in space
and through my breathing I could accumulate this certain kind of tension
or energy in my chest or in my in my body as a whole
which I would then release in this kind of sudden spontaneous motion
and then I would observe how the the object moved in response to that kind of release of tension
and that observation brought me this kind of sense of fulfillment or satisfaction
I felt like I was observing some like purely physical process by turning myself into a an automaton or something
yeah and that sounds kind of bizarre but I can I can characterize it like that
it may just be very difficult to describe in ordinary language
whether or not sounds bizarre isn't isn't so much the issue
but I want to understand a little better
suppose you're looking at the pencil you feel the buildup of the energy
you focus it in a sense you hold on to it for a moment you build it
and then you express it with sudden movement
what what then would change about the pencils location in space would it would you be touching the pencil tell me more
I felt like I was canceling any kind of prior historical influence that I may have exerted on the pencil
so I was effectively like undoing or a nulling certain influences in time that may have issued from some other kind of cognitive state
which I regarded as less than ideal or less than beautiful
so I was I was engendering something like beauty it was a I mentioned a work of art
so I was basically turning my body into a work of art that could cancel historical
um contingencies or
um
rough spots yeah
so there was a very clear distinction in my experience between the sacred and the profane
so in order to enter into this sacred state of consciousness or this kind of sacred space
I needed to accumulate this energy for it to be released
um and that release was always quite fleeting it was this fleeting sense of dwelling in the right state of consciousness
um
you know the the state of consciousness in which I could undo certain historical mistakes
um
you know living in living in profane time in other words
mm-hmm
you know
because when I see
go ahead
when when I interact with objects in profane space I tend to use objects as
you know these utilitarian artifacts or tools
um
I make use of them without fully understanding them
Wow
and that meditative state I think was
capable of of undoing some of those influences
um
because I felt like I was actively maybe changing or influencing the state of this uh this object
yeah
I'm reminded of
um
the concept of sin not necessarily in the religious tradition
but in the philosophic tradition
as of having
mis-acted somehow or mis-appropriated being or mis-understood relationships
and the possibility of rectification
of un-sinning
yes
right
okay
um
um
and so
where is the space
it seems as if you may be saying that the the space in which the problem existed
as you experienced it then and I'm not sure if you still experience it this way because we're speaking of your childhood
um but is that space temporality or is it both temporality and actual physical space or is there a third thing involved how how would you characterize it
characterize it
I would characterize it as preeminently temporal yeah
mm-hmm so it's as if there's a problem in time
and perhaps it's a relational problem
yes
mm-hmm
in other words the pre-orientation of relational activity creates something that must be resolved
I think feel free to correct that you know like yeah whatever
yeah I think I was really struggling with chronological time I was struggling with history
so even when I was younger my sense was that I was ejecting myself from history by entering into these states of consciousness
mm-hmm
even then I understand what I was doing more clearly now
but yeah that I think that would be worth mentioning
hmm that's astonishingly profound
hmm I suspect there are others who would not merely understand what you're trying to communicate here but would have had some experience of something very similar themselves
um
have you ever encountered any any people who did
I don't think so
okay
and how did your parents respond to this situation and give us some idea of you know your age at which this started to become perhaps in some way obvious and or you know something that had to be addressed somehow
yeah I think it manifested between the ages of 10
and 16
yeah
I mean my parents were concerned
because I needed to go through these rituals constantly
even in the context of seemingly mundane everyday tasks
like the clothing that I would wear
I was extremely conscious of the way that my clothing was interacting with my body
mm-hmm
so
my mom quickly
realized what was going on at some level and she became concerned
yeah I bet
yeah
unfortunately there's probably no
way for your parents regardless of how enlightened or unenlightened they may have been to have understood what
your experience
from whence your experience was originating
what your experience was actually like
and I'm guessing did you ever did you ever attempt to explain any of this to them were you Kate did you feel you were capable of explaining how did you feel
I could describe some of the qualities of my experience
but I had no theory of what I was experiencing or coherent description
mm-hmm
as I do now I think to some extent
and so what happened were you psychologized medicated what took place
I received therapy for it and I was medicated yes
I was diagnosed with OCD and I was given all sorts of medicines
I see
yeah
and
how do you feel now about what happened in that process
I think well something about it is unfortunate
but I think it makes sense you know my parents only wanted the best for me and they were trying to look out for me
and you know I was I was troubled by what I was experiencing at some level
it was an all-consuming preoccupation which detracted from other aspects of my life
but those currents are still in my psychology as I mentioned so today when I read a book for example
I treat the book similarly to the way that I used to treat all other objects
so so now almost I can I can almost characterize this as as if what I used to experience for every object
has been subordinated or sublimated to a specific class of objects
mm-hmm and my way of relating to those objects
and that specific class is books
yeah literature yeah
and is that a relief
in a certain respect I suppose
yeah
because it does
it does seem to be very demanding
if all objects have to be treated in a similar fashion
right exactly
because then essentially you have to unbind from historical time and relation
any object upon which your attention come you know that comes into your attention I suspect
right and the trance is impossible to maintain indefinitely anyway
so it helps to have a specific class of object through which you can enter the hypnotic state
uh-huh
that's very profound
um have you ever actually experienced hypnosis have you been hypnotized by someone else
I haven't
I haven't
hmm
um
are you capable of
sorry
go ahead please
well I read about hypnosis initially in the context of Jacques Vallée's works and he convinced me that
hypnosis tends not to add significant data to you know paranormal percipients so I took his word for it
and I just I haven't received hypnosis or you know formally although in my view I just tend to hypnotize myself
I do it fairly regularly
um are you able to generate transit will
uh yeah it takes effort
okay
but I think I can do it
uh-huh
um
yeah I'm just curious about these matters because I'm extremely fascinated by the
features of human experience awareness and behavior
that are collected under this rubric
um
I've had some experience with them myself
some of that experience I find very surprising
I'm still trying to understand something that resembles
so one of the topics that fascinates me this won't be a long lecture but is the
um
the historical arcs that led to the kinds of minds and common mental experience that we have today
we might think of this as the origins of consciousness
uh
and so I'm very curious what
historical
developmental
um
situations
led to
um
the possibility of what we would call hypnosis
where
effectively
it seems
um
human
some human being
either gives to another human being the authorization to direct their consciousness
or
the other human being
um
effectively
this is probably the wrong word but enchants the subject
uh
and
i find this very fascinating i find its implications about the nature of consciousness and identity quite provocative
because it
violates a lot of what we would ordinarily think about
what we would commonly think about the nature of personality identity and consciousness does that make much sense
yes
yes
it does
so these are these are some of the reasons why i'm very curious about that
i've been uh i've begun a conversation with we lead gerard barlow who is a mesmerist
um
there are very very few of these folks around these are people who
can uh produce trance non-verbally
um
sometimes
uh instantaneously
i'm looking forward to continuing that conversation
but
um
we can return back to
what was going on here
so about what time
about what age did you begin to receive therapy and or medication
i must have been
in my early teens
yeah
13
14
and
you know there's so much more that we're going to get to here but i do want to know a bit about your history and i want the listeners to hear
some of your experience of this because many
many of the unusually minded people i know
have been tormented by medication
um
and uh
do you feel comfortable saying what medications you were subjected to or were given to you
i don't even remember
i don't even remember uh
mm
uh
are we talking things like adderall or
ritalin
i took ritalin
oh
i was hospitalized at one point
because i was depressed
um
um
um
i don't remember
okay
yeah that's fine
um
it's probably
maybe it's even better that you don't remember who knows
uh
uh
and then
at what point did
did that
taper off
uh
the the um
the obsessions or
no the medication
and the therapy
medication
i stopped taking medication
around the age of
18 or 19
mm-hmm
yeah
okay
yeah that was a deliberate choice i i chose to to stop
was it challenging what what did you what did you experience
well medication helped me do well in school
um
gave me a lot of energy it was like cappuccino every morning
right
mm-hmm
um
made me
want to be busy
so
i think that was really the function of the medication in the first place
uh
it allowed me to withstand the tedium of schooling
that was really
the function that it served
yeah basically
just give the kids methamphetamine
and
they will
you know
toe the line
of the ridiculous
mostly ridiculous
um
subjugation that they're going to experience in the classroom
right
right
and you know as a kid i wanted to do well in school and i wanted to
make my parents proud so
yeah
it served its
purpose
mm-hmm
and then after a certain point it failed to serve any purpose
whatsoever
so
um
so
was the process of coming off the medication challenging
and
you know how did your parents respond
how did the authorities respond
they were supportive i think
mm-hmm
okay
that's that's helpful
yeah
i mean the medication never
synergized
well with my
way of thinking
so
i found myself feeling like a zombie
or feeling depressed
here and there and
um
yeah i just felt like i was in prison
mm-hmm
i hear you man
mm-hmm
um
you know i i want to
start to turn the conversation toward your interest and experience of the non-ordinary
but without dismissing what you shared about your uh your childhood and your your fascinations and your way of being in consciousness which was certainly very different from probably almost everyone around you
uh
uh
so
um
were you able to have friends
did you play with other children tell me a little bit about your social
uh
uh
oh yeah i mean i always had a few friends
um
typically two at a time
mm-hmm
i had two friends at a time
yeah
that's similar to my experience actually yeah
mm-hmm
i had two very close friends one or two
and even this the teachers at school were like you know i think something's wrong with darren like why is it well he only plays with one child
my parents like yeah and what's the problem
which wasn't actually entirely true i i mean for myself i was um friendly with broad a broad spectrum of children in elementary school but i would only have one or two close friends
mm-hmm
mm-hmm
right
i liked the other children generally uh and enjoyed i think i mostly enjoyed their esteem so
but i wasn't um i wasn't particularly uh what they call it uh extroverted
oh i see
um
yeah i mean that's so did you did you engage in play with other children toys and things
i think so yeah i think so um
in preschool i can remember playing with other children yeah
and what about toys in general in childhood
um
well i used to enjoy making these picturesque scenes with my toys
which i think i mentioned
previously
um
you know i would arrange my toys in these kinds of
sets
um
like crystalline images that i could meditate on really i was meditating on these scenes
essentially
with these toys i would position them carefully and
and uh
bask in those kinds of relations
yeah i think i was experiencing a certain kind of
uh satisfaction from that
the the interesting
implication of what you're saying here
is that
and you know this is my own perspective and i'll take responsibility for it
and again with anything that i may you know offer in the conversation
please don't hesitate to correct me or
um
modify
you know
improve what i what i may have said
but it seems to me that you're you're occupying a kind of a transcendental position
um
that isn't really in ordinary reality or what regular humans experience at all
and what do you mean by transcendental
um
hmm
so when you talk about the
the scenes that you would compose
and their impact their impact on or how you related with them their impact on your consciousness or your awareness
this is a very extraordinary it seems to me mode of relation with both the potential of toys
right
because
um
um what we might think of as regular children
right they would take the dinosaur and they would imagine it being an actual dinosaur perhaps
and maybe the worm would turn into the jurassic world
and they would you know march it around and maybe fight other dinosaurs or you know jet airplanes would come in
and there'd be you know godzilla battles in their imagination
um i you know my imagination when i was in in childhood
was very profound and i could the universe would transform around this like for example just playing with a stick or some dirt
um
somehow there was this
there was this
you've seen it cartoonized in cartoons like calvin hoves
um where he you know is playing with toys and he's sort of in an imaginary world
with monsters and you know he's he's kind of a god-like figure in the world which i was too
in my imaginings although the idea of gods wasn't a thing really in childhood
it was more this perspective of
the one who makes the world
and perhaps this is a way in which all play of children is transcendental
because it's not as if they necessarily imagine themselves to be gods
but there might be a natural
uh meta position over
where okay they don't merely see what's in front of them
right
and so your unique way of not merely seeing what's in front of you
is on you is transcendental i think to what ordinary children if there are such things
usually do when they play
did you ever play with toys in the way that other children played with them even with other children
occasionally yeah i think so
hmm okay oh excellent
with action figures and yeah
yeah i mean who knows what kinds of toys you had i had hot wheels
um model aircraft uh lots of i had a menagerie of animals and monsters and things
i had legos
um what else i had books i had you know we could make blanket forts and all kinds of stuff like that
mad hot wheel cities we used to build insane things out of legos
um but that was you know all i guess all through my childhood probably from what four or five when i began to play with toys
um i think something else is going on but i'll leave that aside for the moment
um so did you have any uh unusual or paranormal thoughts on that
um i think something else is going on but i'll leave that aside for the moment
um so did you have any uh unusual or paranormal experiences as a kid um with say
oh by the way what do you recall of your dreaming as as a child
anything
um i recall yeah snapshots
yeah snapshots um
um
nothing about my dreaming ever startled me or
felt particularly abnormal
um
um
my experience with
you know the paranormal i think was
fairly um
visceral
yeah
say more
oh well i i underwent this uh series of experiences when i was 15
that transformed the way that i think about the world and catalyzed my interest in philosophy and
um
you know the nature of science and human history
um
you know so yeah i had i had this series of ufo experiences
um
that
deeply
yeah
disturbed me initially
because everything about the world that i thought was coherent
was um
undermined
and i was forced to
think critically for myself about what the world could possibly be
if such a thing could happen to me
um
yeah
okay so let's hear the history in sequence of these experiences
uh so the first experience took place in march of 2009
i was living in connecticut at the time
and
um
i went for a walk with my dog one morning as i usually did
i used to love to walk my dog through the woods
there was a wooded area near the house where i used to take him after school
uh
but in the morning i would take him down the street
just to the stop sign and back
and
um
yeah this one morning
as i was walking him
um
i saw this object in the distance
that suddenly
flew vertically and made this kind of
noise
it was like
uh
the sound of
rushing
air
or wind
it sounded mechanical
um
it sounded like
almost like a vacuum cleaner
or a hair dryer
you know the sound of air being pushed through some kind of mechanical device
and
uh
yeah i watched this object fly vertically
and
you know i was scared so i i ran back to the house
and
as i stood
in the front lawn
i watched it
fly toward me
and it flew directly overhead
um
as the sun was
rising
so i was able to see its shape and
its color
um
you know it was a triangular object
it had three lights on it
um
these lights were
white
but they were about the size of
stars in the night sky
they were pinpoints of light
pinpoints of light
that appeared to be extending
beyond the surface of the object
almost like small bulbs or christmas lights
um
you know instead of being embedded in the structure of the object
uh
which i found interesting
um
in the center of the object there was this red light that appeared to be
almost inset or inlaid
um
as if it was sunken into the structure of the object
uh the surface of the object itself appeared to be leathery it had a kind of mesh
around it
um
and it flew directly overhead it was within maybe a hundred feet
um
and it flew slowly making this mechanical noise
and i watched it disappear over the horizon it was like it was flying at treetop level
hmm
um
um
and so
did your pet respond
um
i wasn't actually looking at him at the time so i don't know what he was doing
but he stayed with me he was a pretty good dog he he always stayed by my side
but i was looking up i was looking at you know overhead
of course
um
um
so what i found curious about that experience was that the object
i either was surprised by my presence
um
but in general it you know it flew in my direction which i always found somewhat curious
uh
so it appeared to be startled by my my appearance and then it turned to fly directly overhead
um
so i got a very good look at it yeah
and it was you ran broad daylight
uh-huh
yeah
so that was the experience that i had
okay so it's pretty hard to
um
suppose that either a you were having an imaginary experience
uh you know i'm i'm aware of the capacity for humans to have hallucinations
many of us have experienced them we've experienced
liminal states of consciousness and so forth perhaps
before sleeping or after sleeping
but what you're describing sounds like an everyday occurrence happening in broad daylight
exactly
you know when you're walking your dog
even though you are someone who has experienced trance
there's no indication that you're in trance here is there
no
no
yeah
yeah
and so
you saw it it it seemed to approach you
and then you fled
or correct that for me
i fled as soon as i saw it fly vertically because i was startled
so i watched it for a few for a few seconds and then i i went back to my my front front yard
could you still see it at that point
uh yep i was basically running backwards so i ran to the front yard looking behind myself as i ran
right okay
initially i thought it was some kind of military aircraft so i was very confused right about what was going on
yeah yeah
yeah
it's funny because um
the problem here is that if the tree of categories can be violated
that draws into question the entire tree
right
right
so if we see something or have we if we have an experience as a human being
that doesn't fit into the categories that we have even if we have the category you know ufo or whatever right
if we have this kind of experience the problem is that it draws the whole category tree into question
because now what we don't know what the universe is anymore we're not sure what that what the universe is we don't know what the world is we're not sure what the sky is
right yes because it fundamentally us it um it performs what i would call humans can do this theoretically in religions it performs what i call an attack on the super container
which means that all the thing that all other concepts depend upon for their validation is drawn into question does that make sense
yeah it does
and so you have this experience at 15 you you ran to your porch what happened next
i just watched it fly overhead and i continued to watch it until it uh disappeared
so i saw it disappear over the trees
and were the lights continuous did they flash how was the lighting situation
yeah the lights were continuous they were steady pinpoints of light
the red light seemed much more ambient more vague
but the white lights on each corner
were sharply defined
yeah they were
they seemed to be almost like exhaust or some kind of
they they appeared not to have a solid boundary like you would imagine a glass bulb
right they literally looked like stars
mm-hmm
yeah distending from the side
follow yeah
um was the shape an elongated
triangle or was it exactly i guess i don't know what the geometric term is it
it is
yeah it was an equilateral triangle
okay
yeah so each
exactly yeah great
okay so what happened after that
i ran inside i told my parents i think they were still asleep
i was a i think it was around 6 20 a.m.
mm-hmm so my parents were still in bed
um and uh you know they they didn't hear anything or see anything so
um i went to school that day feeling really energized and and and um
baffled obviously
uh and i think i may have told one of my teachers that you know i experienced this uh this ufo or something
um you know i looked it up on my computer and i i realized that other people had seen something like that before um
you know and i was always generally curious about uh ufos you know as a child
um you know i would see you know documentaries on the history channel
growing up
um so i knew where to look roughly for you know
information so i found move on you know the mutual ufo network
mm-hmm
um and through their database i discovered that other people had had experienced something similar so
i submitted my own report
mm-hmm and i was eager to speak to some of these move on field investigators
um because i imagine that oh they must really know what's going on maybe they they have connections or they can help me understand
um so that happened sometime later but
um
i take it you were quite disappointed
in that goal
i wasn't disappointed but you know i i realized that
well i eventually realized that
you know move on is
less than scientifically reputable so
um you know i subscribed to their magazine for about a year and
um i just found their their interpretation of this phenomenon to be rather
maybe archaic or
uh one-dimensional
uh one-dimensional
uh you know their emphasis on
on you know extraterrestrials and
so on
uh now i totally reject for the most part
um
uh
yeah but i mean that day i just felt energized and excited because my world had been
profoundly
um
yeah i guess uh transformed or
punctured
my bubble was punctured
so i felt energized
that day
um
ten days later i experienced another
encounter with something very similar
um
around 11 30 p.m. on
march 29th
2009
i was in bed
trying to go to sleep
and um i heard this sound outside
it was like a rumbling
sound of you know some kind
uh so i i leapt out of bed
and i ran to the bedroom window
and i sort of opened the blinds
and i saw this massive
object fly directly over the house from behind me
and it hovered over the front lawn
it basically stopped in midair
and it turned about its axis 90 degrees
and flew to the left
slowly gliding uh as it flew
um
it was a it was a dark
black triangular object
uh with these massive white floodlights
they looked like um
portholes i could almost see into the object
through these
these
these floodlights or portholes
and and this object appeared to be black in color
and it was a lot larger than the first one
um this object was about the size of my house
and it was a fairly large house it was in a suburban area
um
so i ran outside and as soon as i
emerged i i didn't see it i didn't see anything
but i did watch it disappear through my bedroom window
um and as soon as it disappeared i ran outside
uh and i i don't remember you know seeing anything
so
so that was only ten days later
so i was sort of in this
i was swept away by these uh feelings of excitement
and you know i became obsessed with like seeing it again
yeah
i was sort of troubled by it
yeah
did you suspect that
how did you think of the phenomenon
for example
did it did you fit it into some category that might be familiar to us
like did you think that is a spacecraft
that is a multi-dimensional vehicle
there are beings in there
or what did you have any thoughts about
what the character of the phenomenon was
i never developed a theory of what happened
until much later when i started to investigate the writings of jacques valet and others
um initially i was prone to you know the mainstream theories about aliens and um you know what you might find on the history channel i mean i was only 15 years old so
sure i i saw this old man on the history channel making these declarations and he seemed legitimate but as i grew up as i grew up i i tried to reconcile my experience with what i knew about the world and um i was struggling to make things add up in my mind
um so it caused me to re-evaluate more basic assumptions about you know what we think the world really is or what human history is or what what our scientific concepts are you know the nature of science you know how could such a thing elude modern science is that even possible
right how could a child somehow discover you know these cosmic secrets or these cosmic phenomena which uh physicists on television proclaim you know are impossible you know right or unlikely or you know
yeah you know what not exactly the conflict between what we might call i'm gonna try to say useful things here without getting too um
um hyper articulate but the conflict between consensus ontologies scientific ontologies and interior ontologies and there's probably a fourth you know dimension there that i didn't name which you're welcome to opine on if you care to
yeah scientific ontology makes a lot of sense to me um every science presupposes some kind of ontology so uprooting those ontological assumptions or
um presuppositions um became something that really preoccupied my my attention
philosophically
um
mm-hmm
um
i just want to mention that what
what troubled me the most was that in both cases
i was
presumably
or seemingly approached
by this
form of technology or intelligence
i could never reconcile that with any kind of conspiratorial approach
to human history
I could never reconcile that
with any kind of conspiratorial approach to human history.
I just, I struggled to do that.
When I think critically about my memory of what happened,
I just always come up short.
For some reason, these objects were either drawn to me
directly or were impelled to single me out
for investigation or, you know,
but whenever I run down these kinds of conspiratorial,
you know, hypotheses or theory.
Give us an example.
Give us an example of such a conspiratorial hypothesis, please.
Well, the question is,
what about a 15-year-old child
would be so interesting to someone
with the capacity to build a machine like that?
I mean, and you can imagine all sorts of scenarios
where someone like that exists
or, you know, you can imagine
what their motivations might be.
You know, but the challenge is to square that
with a coherent picture of the world
as at least I understand it.
But I always leave myself open
to these possibilities
as I continue to learn more.
I try to remain open, right?
I mean, there are some kind of obvious responses
to that question,
but before I, you know,
before I say much more about that,
I want to mention a couple things
just for people who are listening
and feel free to correct me
or as always, right, in our conversation.
So ontology, the simple way to think about
what is meant by this word
is what is stuff?
What is stuff?
Epistemology is how do we know,
how can we tell what stuff is
or might be or what's meaningful
or what's going on?
And then teleology is sort of like purpose,
I think,
or perhaps you could provide
a simple idea for what teleology is.
Yeah, I think teleology is influence
from the future affecting the present.
Yeah, it's because you're far too sophisticated
for the people around you.
We're just going to skip right over that.
No, I'm kidding.
That's hilarious.
Okay, really?
So that, do you think
that's the standard definition?
Well, this is what I think
Aristotle meant by teleology.
Before Aristotle was integrated
into the Catholic Church.
Before the Catholic Church
turned Aristotle into a Christian thinker.
Aristotle was thinking in terms of time.
He was thinking in terms of causation
when he spoke of purpose or teleology.
Yeah, so I actually,
I think what you've said
is extremely provocative
and it's provocative
because ordinarily,
so, okay,
what do you think ordinary people think
teleology means?
Well, I think ordinary people
derive their interpretation
of teleology from people like Descartes.
So Descartes rejected teleology
because Descartes imagined
that we need to remove purposes
from causal explanations
in light of the mechanical philosophy,
which is the idea that motion occurs
through some kind of mutual collision
of particles or,
you know, what Descartes called corpuscles
before the modern atomic theory.
Newton, I think,
represented this transition away
from Cartesian physics
because Newton wanted to embrace
the idea of action at a distance.
I mean, that was what made
the concept of gravity so significant.
But in general, I think,
you know, everyday people
think that purpose means
something like,
you know, raison d'etre, right,
or reason to exist,
which in a certain sense,
I think it does,
but in a limited sense.
Me too.
Yeah, me too.
In other words,
you know,
a modern scientist rejects
the idea that the apple
falls to the center of the earth
because the apple wants
to occupy the center of the earth.
And obviously you meant
toward the center of the earth.
Go ahead.
Well, Aristotle thought
that earth was naturally attracted
to the center of the cosmos.
So Aristotle thought
that place means something.
Descartes rejected
the idea of place entirely
and replaced it
with our everyday notion of space, right?
So in modern science,
no such thing as place really exists.
No object intrinsically belongs
to any place in modern science.
And this is what makes
all of our mathematical tools
so powerful.
We can extract or abstract
an object from its context
and treat it as some kind of
you know, abstract
being in a coordinate system
or in some phase space.
You know, Descartes contrived
this whole notion
of coordinate systems
and, you know, grids
in which we can manipulate
or imagine the movement of objects.
So his rejection of teleology,
I think, was bound up
with his emphasis
on coordinate systems
and the rejection
of belongingness,
which I think is still
characteristic of modernity.
Even today,
we sort of feel like
we no longer belong
to any place.
And that,
I think that comes from people
like Descartes,
ultimately,
in his perspective on physics,
which Aristotle never shared.
Aristotle believed
that place was a physical concept.
So the place of Earth
is at the center
of the cosmos
for Aristotle.
And he called that teleology,
right?
Oh, really?
Yeah, yeah.
So,
and this also was,
I think,
influential
in the alchemical tradition
because the alchemical tradition
derived a lot of its
ideologies
from Aristotelian physics.
Yeah.
So,
so the alchemist
was essentially
quickening
the tempo of nature.
And by quickening
the tempo of nature,
the alchemist
was able to bring
an object
to its proper place,
the place toward which
the object
naturally tends.
So the alchemist
was a kind of midwife
of beings in the world,
in a manner of speaking
in line with
the Aristotelian notion
of telos.
Yeah.
Do you see
some relation
between
this rectification
of the object's
developmental path
and
the
intense
fascination
and awareness
that you were experiencing
in childhood?
Perhaps.
Yeah.
I only,
I noticed that
in my own thought
there's,
there's a,
there's a relationship
there of some kind.
I don't mean to
reify it,
but
well,
the alchemical tradition
I think was much more
specific than
what I experienced.
Yes,
of course,
but I want to go back.
I don't mean to,
to break
the line of thought
here,
but I want to go back
to the question
you asked
about the
objects
in the sky,
if indeed
they were even objects.
The,
because again,
you have this problem
of the violation
of categories.
we today think
of such things
usually,
we tend to
as humans,
we think of them
as machines.
Other people
such as Jacques Vallée,
one of my other friends,
Mr. S,
are not disinclined
to consider
to consider
that they could
be projections
of some kind
or even
a sort of
a virtualization,
right?
Because
they often
appear
to move
in ways
that are not dissimilar
to how something
moves on a computer
screen,
for example,
or might move
on a computer screen
without concern
without concern
for any physical
any apparent
physical constraints,
right?
Right,
yeah.
Well,
something about
its motion
I always found
slightly unnerving
even to this day.
That doesn't surprise me.
I mean,
I imagine
first of all,
this is a concept
or excuse me,
this is a branch
of experience
that has fascinated
me since childhood.
Obviously,
I was,
my childhood occurred
primarily in the 1960s
and early 70s.
So,
we were,
you know,
this is the time
I probably read
Eric Von Doniken's
Chariots of the Gods
when I was
eight
or nine,
maybe.
We saw the movie
a couple years later.
We considered,
we were very curious
about such topics
in my family,
particularly my father
and I had long discussions
about
what are,
what are UFOs.
I was fascinated
by aerospace,
jet aircraft,
missiles,
all of these things.
Sorry,
it's going to be
a little noise
for a moment
in the background.
So,
you know,
I was extremely curious
about these things
but I was primarily
curious because
I suspected
having read
quite a bit
of science fiction
in my youth
and I can,
you know,
the parents of my mind,
the primary parents
of my minds,
my mind
and my intellect
were science fiction
authors up until,
oh,
gosh,
I don't know,
late teens,
early 20s
when I began
to read literature
and a few other things.
but
my primary
hope was that
it might be possible
to contact
something that was
actually intelligent.
I'm not sure
if I felt
the same way
that I feel now
when I was younger
but even if I wasn't
conscious of it,
I felt very skeptical
about what I
would conceive of
as the intelligence,
quote unquote,
of my species
because at the species level
most of what
our species does
not only doesn't
look intelligent,
it looks reckless
or misguided
or omnicidal
is a word
I invented.
I coined that
a long time ago.
Just like everything
killing.
So my hope
was that it might
be possible.
There might be
other intelligences
in time space
that compared to us
we're vastly
more intelligent
and could help us
this funny idea
of the rectification
could help us
to correct
or at least
could introduce
ideas and ways
of knowing
and ways of seeing
and ways of understanding
and perhaps ways
of relation
and behavior
that were much
more trustworthy
than what we
usually see.
And again,
as a human being
we have this problem
of being aware
of the worst
common denominator
of human behavior
or history,
right?
And we're not
so aware
of what I might
call the best
rare exemplars
or the best
rare numerators
or something
like this
if we're
playing around
with the language
and the math
because we still
rarely encounter
truly beautiful
maybe in art
and sometimes
in science
and sometimes
in philosophy
and perhaps
even sometimes
in religion
or spirituality.
But we very
rarely directly
encounter
brilliant examples
of humans
embodying
and enacting
the up-ladder
quote-unquote
potentials
that we
certainly are
capable
of exploring
enacting
considering
reflecting upon
helping each
other
to see
or grow
into.
What are
your thoughts?
I tend
to agree.
I only
became
conscious
of
the
intelligence
behind
what I
experienced
later.
I began
to intimate
the possibility
that the
intelligence
could be
vaster
than what
I initially
imagined.
And what
did you
initially
imagine?
I initially
imagined
some kind
of biological
alien
intelligence
from some
others
in our
system.
You know?
Yeah, me too.
But that was
super exciting
because I
thought
it's possible
that they
are vastly
more intelligent
than we are.
It seems
very likely
that they
would be.
It does.
Yeah.
And yet
when I
began to
research these
things and
read books
and so on
about it
and this
is before
this became
sort of
there was
always a
bit of a
craze
quote-unquote
thing about
it.
But it
wasn't
culty.
It wasn't
yet culty.
It wasn't
very culty
until maybe
the 90s.
I mean, I
don't know
when, I
guess the
Urantia
books came
out in
the 80s
which were
essentially
sort of
an ET
religion.
Are you
familiar with
that at
all?
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, but
when I began
to read
books,
there were
a variety
of very
problematical
things about
the books.
And one
of them
was there
was almost
not none
but it
was extremely
uncommon
that there
was any
kind of
coherent
record of
the transmission
of intelligence
between
the others
and humans.
I found
that very
confusing.
Right.
How could
that be
true?
You meet
beings from
the sky
or, you
know, if
we're going
to be a
little more
exotic,
time space,
right, or
even more
exotic,
that which
time space
is some
sort of
less, a
hypostasis
of, right,
a lesser
dimensionalization
of something
beyond time
space, which
should, very
obviously
these days
even physicists
like Arkani
Hamed and
others have
said categorically
time space
is doomed.
For sure
that's not
fundamental.
You've heard
noises like
this, right?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Which I'm
sure we both
find fascinating
and fraught
with potential
for what
exciting new
discoveries.
Although I
want to say
something very
briefly before
I continue
on this
line.
I don't
want the
humans to
make any
more exciting
discoveries at
all.
I don't
believe we
can survive
the discoveries
we've made
as a species.
I'm going to
say some
very kind
of severe
sounding things
for a minute
but then
we'll get
back to
the sort
of regular
conversation.
I don't
think it's
ethical to
give the
existing
civilizations
anything
technological.
They will
use it to
destroy,
fuck, they
would destroy
time space if
they could get
away with it.
We hear
these stories
in some
ancient
religious
texts about
we need
to stop
the humans
from getting
together.
We need
to confuse
their languages
because if
they have
one language
they will
attack
heaven.
There's
noises like
this probably
in certain
parts of
the Bible
or the
Apocrypha.
We hear
noises like
this around
the narrative
of the
Tower of
Babel.
They're
actually
trying to
kill the
angels and
so forth.
We hear
these kinds
of noises.
Actually,
I'm an
anthropophile.
I love
human beings
unlike many
intellectuals
who are
misanthropes.
But at
the group
level, we
are so
disoriented.
What
orients
us or
captures our
orienting
capacities at
the group
level,
they look
essentially like
demons to
me.
It almost
doesn't matter
if actual
demons exist
in sort of
the terrifying
sense of
demons rather
than the
edifying or
transcending
sense of
daimon
teaching
beings.
But yeah,
I mean,
at the group
level, we
are a
devastating
nightmare.
So I
don't want
there to be
like,
I would
you know,
I'm kind
of like,
I would
wave a
flag that
says no
more
discoveries
in terms
of
technology.
And I
think it's
unethical for
scientists who
exist today to
deliver their
findings to
modern
civilization,
societies,
corporations,
whatever,
because it's
just fundamentally
going to be
weaponized.
we're in this
trap of a
race to the
bottom.
Your thoughts?
Well, this
is why I
tend to be
skeptical of
disclosure in
general.
Say more.
Well, I
mean, my
impression is
that disclosure
will be used
to peddle
purportedly
alternative forms
of technology
under the
guise of
some kind
of extraterrestrial
intervention,
which I
find extremely
questionable.
Wow.
Okay, so
paint a little
cartoon of what
that looks like
for us,
please.
Well, the
introduction of
something like
free energy in
the midst of an
energy crisis or
a climate crisis,
I think, is a
real plausible
scenario moving
forward.
So, I
mean, like, I
mean, our
government engages
in all sorts of
continuity of
business operations
and continuity of
government operations.
So, my
suspicion is that
some of those
contingency plans
involve
espousing belief
in extraterrestrial
intervention of a
technological
nature.
Yeah.
All right, so
I'm going to
try to
encapsulate this
I'm going to
try to
encompass what
you're suggesting
here and also
introduce some of
my own
perspective.
But before I
do that, just so
I don't lose a
thread that's
important from
before,
we got here
from a position
in our
discussion where
you event
skepticism about
what you called
conspiratorial
theories
surrounding UFOs
and also
you were having
difficulty, I
think, forging a
perspective from
which you could
make sense of
the semblance of
you having been
selected by this
phenomenon.
Did I understand
that correctly?
Yeah, exactly.
Okay, great.
Great.
So, I'm just
trying to keep the
threads in order
here and we'll get
back to the
disclosure problem.
We're going to
bookmark that for a
sec.
So, did it ever
occur to you that
you're extremely
unusual, but you're
probably not the
only child like you,
but your extremely
unusual relationship
with cognition,
energy, and time
might result in
self-selection for
such phenomena?
Yeah, that became
clear much later.
Okay.
Okay, well, say
something about that
then.
Well, following those
two experiences with
the triangular
objects.
Oh, by the way,
were they, did they
appear to be the
same object or the
same kind of object?
They were different,
but they were the
same kind of object.
Okay.
Post-triangular.
They both had
roughly three white
lights.
In the second case,
the lights were far
larger and they
appeared to be like
portholes.
Right, right.
As opposed to
pinpoints of light.
Oh, okay.
There's something I
just want to highlight
here.
It's as if your
experience is evolving,
isn't it?
Or one could
imagine that.
Yeah, like I
became conscious
later that the
experiences contain a
certain kind of
code or language or
yeah, there's
something hidden
logic.
Okay, great.
Yeah, brilliant.
I'm with you.
Yeah.
And this is
something that I
actively investigate.
so I continue to
experience different
revelations about
what happened to me
in the past and
the nature of
existence and that
kind of stuff.
But what
followed those two
experiences was
even more intriguing
in a certain sense
because I became
conscious of this
relationship between
my observation of
celestial bodies and
whatever this
intelligence was
or is.
So about six
months after those
two experiences,
I was walking
down the street
near dusk
and I became aware
of this scintillating
object in the sky.
and I just
decided to stop in
the road and
observe its
twinkling, its
kind of scintillation.
It was rapidly
moving between
different shades of
blue, red, and
white.
It appeared to be
flashing and that
can happen sometimes
depending on the
conditions of the
atmosphere.
But for whatever
reason, I found it
interesting.
So I stood there
on the road
watching it for
maybe 20 minutes.
And at a certain
point, I decided to
go home.
So I turned around
and as soon as I
turned around, I
saw this what
appeared to be an
orange orb over the
road.
And it was in
midair as I turned
around.
It was flying to the
left and it followed
this kind of
sigmoid shape in
the sky, like an
S-shaped curve
behind a tree.
So I was able to
see the inside of
this orb briefly.
It appeared to be
like almost like
molten metal or
gold swirling
inside this ambient
orange halo.
And I could see
the movement of
this internal
structure.
It looked like
fluid or something
moving.
in a kind of
vortex as this
orb kind of, as
the halo moved
across the sky.
And like I said,
it disappeared
behind this
willow tree.
So, you know, I
walked over to the
willow tree and I
didn't see anything.
So I went home.
But I, but later
it became, you
know, clear to me
that there was some
relationship between
that scintillating
object in the sky,
which was probably a
planet or maybe a
star.
and this orb that I
experienced.
And what I found
curious about that
was this kind of
coordination in space
between the motion
of my body just
happening to glimpse
it behind me as I
withdrew from
observing this
scintillating object.
So there was
something within the
flow of time there
that I gradually
became more
conscious of as I
grew up, I guess,
or just as I
mulled it over, you
know, for years.
So I wanted to
mention that too.
So as I, you
know, continued to
develop, these
connections became
more bizarre or
more problematical.
Yeah.
Okay.
So there's a
hovering implication
in the background
here that I want to
introduce just so that
I don't lose it
because some
threads in my own
consciousness are
very difficult to
sustain over time.
Right?
It's as if there are
certain ideas that
are much more
difficult to keep in
consciousness long
enough to follow the
threads.
Does this make any
sense to you?
Oh, of course.
Yeah.
Okay.
So obviously
dreaming is a
certain kind of
problematical situation
for memory, but
there are certain
modes of insight
which integrate over
the field of the
branches of human
knowledge that are
extremely
problematical to
hold in
consciousness for
more than a few
moments.
In this case, I'm
able to do so for
some reason I don't
quite understand, and
it could be the
synergy of our
intelligences that
makes it easier.
I'd suggest that
it is.
Consider a situation.
You know what
world lines are in
relativity?
Mm-hmm.
I thought you
might.
Consider a situation
in which something
violates them.
So as I understand
it, and I may have
this wrong, I'm not
a physicist.
Each observer has a
certain intrinsically
unique status in
terms of its world
line, in that no
other observer,
quote-unquote, no
other point of
presence in
experience, subjectivity,
whatever you want to
call it, can occupy
the same thing, right,
the same world line.
Is that similar to
your understanding?
Yeah, I think so.
Great.
So if two people are
standing right together
and someone flashes a
light at them, it
doesn't cause their
world lines to
collapse.
They may see the,
they may both see the
light, they will see it
from different angles,
it will reach them at
slightly different times.
Yeah?
Right.
Okay, great.
So imagine something
that violates that,
right?
It starts to, it, it, by
its appearance, it
collapses world lines.
So it unifies, remember
how you were talking
about historical
rectification in your
childhood?
You're talking about
doing something to the
world line of the
situation, are you not?
In a sense?
Yeah.
Okay, yeah, yeah, you
got me.
And so now here's this
object that actually
might be doing something
extremely related to
your obsessive concern
in childhood.
Right, exactly.
Okay, great.
Yeah.
Okay, so if we don't
have the right language
and I'm not a quantum
physicist and I'm very
leery of people who like
to use their probably
clumsy understandings of
concepts from quantum
physics to explain
metaphysical phenomenon and
so forth.
I'm very leery of
that.
I'm not saying there's
nothing good in that
garden, but it makes me
itchy usually.
And then at the same
time, sometimes I myself
will do it.
So I'm going to make that
mistake here after
admitting it and try to
imagine what would
happen if something
appeared that was mostly
in superposition but
partly not.
That would mean that local
to that object, it could
mean anyway, that world
lines merge or they
blur around this object.
And if that's happening,
that means that time, okay,
time is going to become sort
of a multi-liquid, identity
is no longer going to be the
same thing.
You're not who you are
anymore.
Birth and death, before and
after, above and below, the
entire problem of angles on
the sphere, all of those
things are placed into a
non-ordinary situation.
What do you think?
I can see what you mean.
Okay.
Yeah.
Certainly something at least
vaguely similar has occurred
to you, yes?
Yeah.
I mean, I sometimes toy with
this idea that space itself
is the composition or the
simultaneous appearance of
different temporal scales.
So I can perhaps see how that
ties into what you, what I
think you mean.
Yes, because if there's
something in, by the way,
this brings us back to the
importance of not merely of
place, but of moment.
Because we are bodies.
And as bodies, we are
something like points of
presence.
Now, what produces the point
is up for, uh,
what, um, creative, um, I'm
at a loss for a word here.
Imaginings, essentially, right?
Creative, um, speculation.
That's the word I want.
And I don't think that, uh, we
are as distinct as we imagine.
I think that I usually prefer
to think I can think many
different things.
I can think many things at once
when I'm lucky.
But I usually prefer to think
that the point of presence that
we are is not so much an
individual, but an instancing
of many relationships.
Does that make any sense?
Oh, yeah.
Okay, great.
Um, now I don't want to get
lost in Darren's thoughts or
perspectives on reality.
That's, that's not why we're
here today.
So let's redirect the
conversation back to our
bookmark.
And what was that bookmark?
Help me out.
Can you recall?
You mentioned, uh, disclosure.
Yes, that's it.
Thank you.
I got lost in the thread mess
there for a minute.
And that was almost hypnotic.
So, all right.
So I want to, I want to say a
few things about this
disclosure thing.
So first of all, I want to,
um, re capitulate something
like what you said.
that the government could
essentially run a PSYOP, if I
was understanding you, in
which, um, the existence of
free energy would be falsely
associated with, uh,
relationships with either
non-existence, non-existent or
non-actually relating with us,
uh, aliens.
Were you, um, were you
proposing something like that?
Yeah.
Free energy could be
justified under the guise of
its having descended from
some alien intelligence.
Yeah.
Right.
And, uh, so, you know, some
what, maybe 20 years ago now
or close, I wrote an essay
called free energy would mean
the end of life on earth.
Um, I, I presume that you
don't believe our species could
survive the introduction of
free energy.
Do you?
No.
Neither do I.
How long do you think if
somebody produced a free
energy device introduced it,
how long do you think we'd
have?
Just take a wild guess.
Matter of weeks.
Yeah, me too.
Yeah.
Um, yeah, the humans
certainly in their present
state can't be trusted with
anything that could be, I
mean, that's the ultimate
weapon.
Um, in fact, it's a weapon
that may, you can just keep
making weapons with it.
I recall a not too old, um,
episode of Star Trek.
Uh, I don't remember which, um,
which series it was.
It, it's one of the newer ones
where, um, the Federation detects
a warp signature at a
previously, um, off limits in
terms of the prime directive
planet, right?
Because the thing that
determines when, when you can go
contact them directly is when
they, when they're capable, when
they become capable of warp
drives, right?
So the Federation detects a
warp signature, they send the
ship, their ship disappears.
So they send another ship and
what they find out is that this
planet has discovered the
technology that warp drives are
based on, but it's their
intention and what they're
doing is producing weapons with
it, using warp weapons, which not
just kind of, you know, it's a
world ending technology that can
actually damage time space.
And this goes back to the
problem with the humans not
being trustworthy with the
technique of the divine beings
or the gods or the sky beings or
however we want to think about
that.
But I just want to, um, briefly
outline something that I'm a
little bit concerned about and
feel free to ask me questions or I
will ask you further questions.
Give me just a moment here.
So we've heard from people like
David Grush and others, many
others, um, to such a degree
that it seems unlikely that the
whole thing is a fabrication, that
the United States government is now
and has long been in possession of
crashed alien objects, alien
technologies.
some things which have been either
partially or, you know, somewhat
successfully reverse engineered.
They are in possession of
intelligence about non-humans of
some kind, right?
We don't know whether they're
physical beings, whether they are,
um, there's lots of, there's,
there's probably, actually, it's not
that they are one thing.
There's a spectrum.
Even the, when we just say the word,
the phrase, the phenomenon, right?
We're referring to a broad spectrum
of phenomena.
We're, we're referring to a broad
spectrum of possible explanations.
There could have been beings from other
planets that actually visited our planet
in a spacecraft.
There could also be things that resemble that
or mimic it that are not beings in a
spacecraft and so forth.
Does all that make sense so far?
Yes, it does.
Okay, so if some faction of the government
is in possession of technologies
from other intelligences or
transcendent things,
that would be the holy grail
of asymmetric military advantage.
It would also be the holy grail
of asymmetric commercial advantage.
And since our collectives,
at the collective scale,
we are captured with game,
by game theoretical,
deadly, lethal, game theoretical,
what would I call it?
A milieu.
Nothing would survive
if the humans weaponized that.
And also, if there's some branch
of the government
in possession of such things,
we've heard stories of
vast underground cities, bases,
all kinds of things
that have been constructed
using non-human technologies.
I'm not sure if this is, you know,
reliable or not.
But if there were a branch
of the government
in possession of such things,
even just of intelligence
about non-humans,
it's the most top-secret thing
of all top-secret things.
It makes things like bioweapons
and nuclear weapons
look like fucking romper room.
So if there's a branch
in possession of that stuff,
effectively what we have
is a speciation event.
Those aren't humans anymore.
Whatever they are,
they're not gods.
And they might be homo sapiens,
you know, in their bodies,
but they're not us.
They're not regular humans.
They don't have to live
by the rules
or any of the stuff
that we think
is running our civilizations.
Your thoughts?
It makes sense to me.
So when you spoke about,
for example, the introduction,
tell me some of your concerns
surrounding disclosure.
Just, you know, improvise.
Well, I mean,
my familiarity
with the whole history
of the UFO phenomenon
leads me to suspect
a certain
dimension of
highly organized
nefarious military involvement.
Me too.
From the very beginning.
Mm-hmm.
So I learned about...
And Vali,
Vali is quite on this page as well.
Right.
Yeah.
So making sense of that
is important
to any coherent theory
of what we currently face.
You know,
so the Maury Island incident,
for example.
Say more.
Explain what that means,
what that is.
So prior to the
Kenneth Arnold sighting,
on June 24th, 1947,
there was an incident
near Tacoma, Washington,
on Maury Island
involving two people
who claimed
that
a group of flying saucers
ejected
some kind of
liquid metal
that fell to Earth,
was captured
and transported
by
Army pilots.
Have you heard of this before?
Mm-mm.
Okay.
Not prior to Arnold.
I haven't.
No.
Yeah, it took place
three days before
the Kenneth Arnold sighting.
Oh, wow.
Didn't know about this.
This is news to me.
Yeah.
As a matter of fact,
Kenneth Arnold,
as I recall,
was paid
by a man named
Ray Palmer
to investigate
the Maury Island incident.
Ray's name is familiar
to me, at least.
I'm with you.
Yeah, Ray Palmer was,
as I recall,
the editor
of Amazing Stories,
which was a science fiction magazine.
Oh, that was super important
in my childhood.
Yeah.
Uh-huh.
He essentially paid
Kenneth Arnold
to investigate
the Maury Island incident,
which involved
a man named
Harold Dahl
and Fred Chrisman.
Interestingly,
Harold Dahl,
um,
well, no,
Fred Chrisman
was later involved
in the John F. Kennedy assassination,
which is rather bizarre.
That was investigated
by Ken Thompson
in one of his books.
He was,
yes,
a very strange fellow.
He was sort of
suspended
between, uh,
the early history
of ufology
and, uh,
this other
strange conspiracy.
Um,
yeah,
but just the,
the precedence
of the Maury Island incident
and the involvement
of Army pilots,
uh,
and their subsequent crash,
uh,
their,
their plane,
which was supposedly
carrying this
retrieved,
uh,
crash debris,
um,
itself crashed
over some forest
and all the evidence
was lost,
uh,
presumably.
So,
if from the very beginning,
you know,
it just,
something about it
seems,
uh,
highly strange,
obviously.
So,
it's worth looking into
the Maury Island case
because,
you know,
it predated the
Kenneth Arnold sighting
and,
and the military
was already involved.
and I,
I think you and I
both agree,
A,
let's just see if we agree.
A,
the military is exactly
the wrong branch
of humanity
to be,
quote,
in charge of
and or,
um,
collecting such intelligence.
Do we agree there?
Of course,
yeah.
And B,
we don't actually
have a branch.
We haven't forged
a branch
of our species
that would be
a good selection
for this,
um,
necessity.
Do we agree there?
I agree,
yes.
And C,
maybe we should
probably get on
with that right quick.
Do we agree there?
Yeah.
Because
the one,
okay,
if we,
as human beings,
believe that we are
intelligent
or we believe
that there's such
a thing as intelligence,
then probably
the two most
important things
we could possibly do
is,
is A,
pursue,
I'm sorry to be
using alphabets here,
is pursue the,
um,
the establishment
of the possibility
of an intelligent
human collective,
number one.
I guess if I don't
use letters,
I have to use numbers,
I'm sorry.
And then number two,
compose a branch
of human
knowledge,
research,
behavior,
and relationships
that reconnect us
to the intelligences
that are clearly
present here
on Earth
in the other biologies
and are very likely
to be present
beyond the Earth,
whether that presence
is as physical organisms
on other worlds
or as some feature
of the nature
of,
I don't know what,
reality,
time space,
whatever time space
is a hypostasis of,
et cetera.
Your thoughts?
Yeah,
the alien intelligence
needs to be localized
to this planet.
I think
the alien intelligence
is coming
from our surroundings,
from our environment.
Say more.
Well,
I mean,
you probably know
about the works
of Michael Persinger
who discovered
the relationship
between tectonic strain
and anomalous
luminous phenomena,
ALPs.
He wrote several papers
on that
and that notion,
as simple as it might seem,
can carry you
into like an alternative
kind of
mental space
where suddenly
the nature
of human cognition
in relation
to its environment
can be physically grounded.
So,
like,
I tend to suspect
that direct realism
is an appropriate
characterization
of human perception
and grounding
direct realism
in something
like the interaction
between
geophysical
forces,
meteorological
forces,
and electrochemical
phenomena
in the human body
seems to be
the most promising
path
when compared
to, like,
contemporary
cognitive neuroscience,
which is downstream
from a lot
of bad philosophy.
Yeah,
this is something
that we're going
to get into
at length,
perhaps a little bit
in this conversation,
but also in future
conversations.
Because what you just,
those,
let's see,
downstream of a lot,
of bad,
yeah,
the six or seven words
you said there
describe much
of Tyler's cognitium
downstream
of a lot
of bad philosophy.
And what I mean
by describe
much of your cognitium
isn't that you fit
in there,
but rather that
you have determined
you have
sort of established
a little island
outside of bad philosophy
from which you
conduct
perspectival operations
against it.
Right.
Yes.
Yeah.
So you're
essentially
a secret agent
for the universe.
That's how it feels.
Me too.
I think that's part
of why
we recognize
one another.
Exactly.
And I think
that's part of
what it means
to be a child.
The problem
is that
most of the
children
get
captured
and compromised.
And as we know
for Mission Impossible,
if you were caught
or killed,
the secretary
will disavow
any knowledge
of your actions.
I mean,
that is a joke.
So,
all right.
Do you think,
what is your,
do you think
there are aliens
in the sense
of biological entities?
I doubt it.
Really?
Yeah,
I doubt that
aliens from
some other
star system
appear here.
Okay.
I think,
do you think
it's possible?
Oh,
sorry,
go ahead.
The alien
intelligence
is all around us.
The alien,
the alien
intelligence
is within us
even.
Yeah.
Yeah,
we agree about that.
I mean,
I would,
I would,
you know,
say that
we're actually
composed of,
I tend to use,
I like the
neologism
transcendence,
but I think that
our intelligence
is a modest
hypostasis,
a lesser,
you know,
instance
of something
staggeringly
transcendental
that is native
to whatever
time space
is a lesser
stasis of.
So,
let me,
let me pose
a,
let me pose
a toy
to you.
Imagine that
you take a,
you find one day
in your kitchen,
you live by yourself,
you find one day
in your kitchen
a glass of water
is on the table,
you know that
you did not put
the glass there,
someone put it there,
you decide not
to interfere with it,
some days later,
perhaps 45
or whatever,
the water has evaporated
in the bottom
of the glass,
there are white crystals.
Do you know
where I'm going here?
It's okay if you don't,
it's okay.
So,
the white crystals
turn out to be salt,
you taste them,
they're salty,
run some chemical tests,
they're actually
sodium chloride.
So,
you realize that
the water was salty,
right?
And so,
when the water
evaporated,
the crystal,
the,
the content
in the water
crystallized
in the bottom
of the glass.
Make sense?
Yes.
Great.
So,
earth probably
isn't entirely
dissimilar
to such a glass
of water.
If you get
organisms here
and mines
and like octopuses
and praying mantises,
and by the way,
like,
there's nothing
as shocking
as organisms.
Organisms
are fundamentally
impossible.
If you pointed
your finger
at the sky
and you went
like,
I don't know,
a million light
years in that line,
you,
the chances
of encounter,
I think,
your chances
of encountering
an octopus
are zero.
There's,
there's gonna be
none of them,
right?
Exactly.
Out there.
So,
you're looking
at phenomenon
that are so
staggeringly
impossible
that humans
should have
just started
screaming,
going like,
whenever they
tried to name
a thing,
it should have
just been,
what the fuck
is that?
Like,
that can't,
that can't exist.
You know,
because tigers,
it can't exist.
Praying mantises,
can't exist.
Octopuses,
trees,
the simplest organ,
you know,
they just,
these are impossible
beings.
And I'm trying
to sing the praises
of the world
that we live on,
a world that I adore
and believe
to be a being,
or even something
we don't have
a category for
that generates
the possibility
of beings
as a side effect
of whatever
that,
you know,
more than merely
a being is doing.
And I'm getting
a little bit into,
you know,
my own sort
of philosophy
or cosmology
or concern here.
But what I'm trying
to get at is this.
If you get hands
or eyes
or minds
on earth,
then the water
of time space,
so to speak,
right,
the milieu,
the context,
must be productive
of those things.
What you don't get
in the glass of water
on your kitchen table
is a wristwatch,
right,
because the water
isn't wristwatchy.
You see what I'm getting at?
Right, of course.
Yeah.
I'm trying to say
that, like,
time space must be
eyesy.
It must be wingsy.
Yes, precisely.
It must be handsy
and mindsy
and adoration-y.
Yes.
And all these things,
right?
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Absolutely.
And it's staggeringly weird
that we are in the grip
of a variety
of ontological deceptions
that pretend
the time space
is just
machine-y.
It's machine-y?
What?
Like, what?
It's hammer-y?
No.
You know,
if I was Amon Hillman,
I'd, like,
go off camera right now
make some spanking noises.
Slap, slap, slap, slap.
Right.
Machine-y?
No.
Well, I mean,
this is why
the Goethean theory
of light
matters so much to me
because
I think
Goethe
enables us
to understand
something about space
such that
organisms
inherit
features
from space itself.
Yes.
Which gives them
these properties,
as you mentioned.
And so this is
why I think
it's weird,
though,
that you think
there aren't...
Well,
I'm not objecting
and I want to know more.
But if time-space
is handsy
and eyesy
and mindsy
and octopussy
and, you know,
like,
praying mantisy
and stuff,
then it must be
aliens-y
because
our world
seems to me
to be filled
with billions
of aliens.
This is a world
in space.
These are
space creatures
all around us.
The insects,
the spider,
the wasp,
you know,
the nudibranch,
the mantis shrimp,
the octopus,
the whale,
the dolphin,
these are aliens.
They're right here.
We don't have to go anywhere
to meet other minds.
Our minds
are made of alien minds,
it seems to me.
But say whatever's
in your heart
or mind
at the moment.
I'll stop blathering.
Well,
in my view,
cognition
forms a continuum
with the morphology
of the organism.
So what we call
cognition
is fundamentally
similar to
or even the same
as identical
with what we call
the form
of the living body.
Brilliant.
Yeah, I see.
And you can see this,
for example,
in the case of plants,
which are stationary
beings.
The plant
is really
a kind of wave.
So what
in the plant
waves?
And this is what
Goethe called
the erpflansa.
This is the
platonic idea
of the plant
or the soul
of the plant.
Like what
Aristotle says.
Yeah.
Or wait,
even the,
okay,
let's say a little
more about that.
I don't want
to just run over it.
It's the
the originary
modus.
I don't know.
Help me out.
Yeah,
the originary
image
that belongs
to the deep
past.
So
the resurrection
of this idea
in the present
is precisely
what I think
Plato meant
by anamnesis,
which I think
Goethe also
saw
in the living
body of
plants.
Because
these
these waves
characterize
organisms
themselves
in the same
way that our
own brains
supply frequencies
at which we
perceive
solid objects
the forms
of organisms
themselves
evince
this
underlying
vibrating
image.
So the
reconstruction
of that image
I think
is fundamentally
holographic
because space
itself is
holographic.
I mean,
it works
like light.
In other
words,
the body
of the tree
is fundamentally
analogous to
the beam of
light that we
can pass
through the
prism
root, because
it undergoes
the same
number of
expansions
and
contractions.
Say more
about that
last feature,
the same
number of
expansions and
contractions.
as you move
from the
root to
the seed
of the
flowering
plant, you
undergo
three expansions
and three
contractions.
So the
seed is a
kind of
contraction.
The seed
leaves, or
cotyledons, are
also a kind
of contraction.
The roots are
a kind of
expansion.
So the
seed mediates
above and
below these
two kinds
of movement
which
recur in
the human
organism.
So our
own bodies
undergo
similar
expansions and
contractions.
We call
contractions
sensation,
whereas we
call expansions
action.
So this
is why the
philosophy of
Henry Birxon
I think is
rather profound
because he
acknowledged the
existence of
perception as
virtual action.
So, oh my
God, we're
you
expressing these
principles in
your childhood
because I
can't help but
see the
reflection.
I can't
say so.
I mean, I
discovered this
independently
many years
later through
my own
readings.
I know.
Can you
see that
your
perception
of the
relationships
in form,
space,
and time
produced?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Great.
So I'm just
going to finish
it for the
listeners.
Produced in
you, not
merely a
sensation, but
an excitation,
which then
led to
what I'm
going to
call a
transcendental
action that
you spoke
of as a
sudden
movement.
Right.
Okay.
Good.
That's the
laughter I've
been wanting
to hear in
this
conversation.
Okay.
Good.
Keep going.
I'll be.
Okay.
So the
organs of
the plant
form a
coherent
whole.
The body
of the
plant is
a whole
which
exercises
causal
power.
Now, the
extent to
which
holes exercise
causal
powers, I
think, is
almost entirely
overlooked by
modern physics
because of our
tendency to
reductionism,
our tendency
to emphasize
the role that
parts play
over holes.
In my
view, holes
are causal
agents, much
as they were
for Aristotle.
Yeah, let's
call them
unities.
Unities, yeah,
sure.
I prefer,
yeah.
Now, the
weird thing
about the
unities, and
particularly the
biorelational
unities here on
Earth, is that
they form what
I refer to as
hyperstructures,
which are
catastrophically
multidimensional
relational
webs, right?
So, what
you'll never
see, for
example, is a
world with
nothing but an
oak tree, or
nothing but an
ant.
You see what I'm
getting at?
Like, the
forms that we
see here are
not possible in
the isolation
that we
imagine if we
think about
individuals.
And so,
somehow, they
are a field
phenomena.
people are
like, we
should save
the ecologies
because they're
really important
to the future
of humans.
No, that's
not why they're
important.
That isn't
untrue.
I don't think
you can harm
the ecologies
of Earth
without harming
the interiority
of humans
in real time.
You kill one
whale, that whale
dies in every
being on this
planet, in
my view.
It's a field.
Does that
make sense?
Yeah, yeah.
The relations
between bodies
in external
space is
mirrored in
the coherence
of the
living body
itself.
So, you
can see this
kind of symmetry
between the
macrocosm and
the microcosm
at work.
Yes, and I
also, I
mean, I
suspect very
strongly rather
provocative ideas
such as the
Earth is a
member of a
family of
similar worlds
that can
probably
communicate
among each
other
instantaneously
so that what
we mess up
here has to
be mitigated
or suffered
in other
places.
Like, damage
here causes
damage elsewhere.
Healing here,
quote unquote,
causes healing
elsewhere.
the humans
have a very
crude idea
of what a
planet is
and they
think it's
separate.
I very
much doubt
this.
I have
strong reason
to believe
that this is
not the
case and
it's not a
theoretical
belief.
It's reason
from direct
experience.
I don't know
what, I
can't tell you
exactly what
the planet
is, but
if I could
even point
you in that
direction, it
would obliterate
the entire
tree of
categories with
which you've
been familiarized
by humans.
It would just
lay waste to
that.
It would burn
it down.
And it would
burn it down
with beauty,
like ecstasy.
What's going
on here is so
preciously
profound and
beautiful that
we don't even
have concepts
that resemble
it in our
lexicon,
in the
category trees
from which
our lexicons
arise.
And I
love
this world.
I love
the living
beings of
this world.
I adore
them.
I know
them as
my own
nature,
origin,
meaning,
body,
purpose,
all these
things.
So I'm
just want to
sing these
praises while
we have a
moment.
And let us
return then
to get
the and
holes and
the
compression
expansion.
Right.
The organs
of any
organism
internally
cohere
according to
a certain
kind of
logic,
which I
think Goethe
was responsible
for discovering
in a major
way.
as opposed
to
regarding
the
organs
of an
organism
as
essentially
disparate
taxonomical
names or
parts,
we should
recognize how
the appearance
of any one
organ presupposes
the appearance
of every other
organ.
which you
can understand
according to
this kind
of wave
form that
never
incarnates
as an
object,
but this
wave form
is a
condition.
Yes.
Yeah.
In a sense,
is this in
any way
related to
what Cornfed
calls
affordances?
Yeah,
in my
view,
perhaps I
introduced
the idea
of affordances
from James
Gibson.
who was
a direct
realist,
which is
why I
find his
theories
useful,
but yeah,
I would
say so.
Okay,
I need
to hear
you say
something
about
direct
realism
because
I'm
not
clear
on what
that
phrase
means.
Help me
understand
it and
feel free
to be,
you know,
like,
explain it
to the
five-year-old
that I
sometimes
become.
Well,
direct
realism
is the
notion that
perception
directly
accesses
phenomena in
the external
world.
The paradigm
of modern
science is
what you
might call
an indirect
realist
paradigm
because
modern
science
essentially
contends
that we
perceive
not the
external
world as
it really
exists,
but by
virtue of
some
process
in the
body,
we
decipher
or encode
information
in the
external
world
in ways
that
fundamentally
corrupt
the
original
image.
So this
all comes
from Galileo
and
from
British
empiricism
because
Galileo
isn't
there.
Okay,
let me just
interrupt.
Please hold
your thought
and I
also want
you to
bookmark
Bergson
because you
mentioned
him and
we
branched.
isn't
there
though
a
precedent
for
this
in
Greek
thought
because
they
thought
something
like
it is
impossible
for us
to
understand
let me see
if I can
recapitulate
this
surely
it is not
possible
for us
to perceive
directly
what is
true
or good
or real
because
we are
human
and our
senses
and the
form of
our humanity
deceive us
therefore
the only
chance
of us
perceiving
the true
the real
or the good
is if
we have
a way
to escape
that cage
they thought
of this
I think
there was
a phrase
called
the soma
pneumatica
which was
the spectral
body
this isn't
exactly the
same as
an out-of-body
experience
though it
might be
related
they want
okay
is any
of this
making any
sense
that we're
stuck
in our
senses
and the
forms
of our
senses
deceive us
about the
nature
of things
well yeah
it makes
sense
yeah
I'm reminded
of that by
what you're
saying go
ahead
oh well I
however would
reject
the idea
that that
somehow
diminishes
the reality
of my
perception
right now
so I
invest my
perception
right now
with as
much
reality
as
how
the
world
might
look
beyond
my
physical
mantle
and this
has to do
with the
holographic
nature of
space
as I
mentioned
so once
you once
you embrace
the notion
that space
is holographic
as opposed
to some
kind of
neutral
medium
or monolithic
container
in which
things are
arbitrarily
moving
the reality
of your
perception
or the
direct
accessibility
of phenomena
through your
perception
becomes I
think much
more coherent
and the
philosophy of
Henry Berkson
I think is
one of the
foundations
of a direct
realist
theory of
perception
as it was
for James
Gibson
because he
was a
he was
fundamentally
a Berksonian
thinker
and yeah
all right
I have a
couple of
questions
briefly
the first
is
when we
think of
the term
holographic
we tend
to think
of things
like photographs
and or
movies
is it
not so
holograms
are distinct
from photographs
because
in a hologram
every region
contains
the potential
to reconstruct
the whole
image
I follow
I'm going
to go
somewhere
with this
though
so
I'm going
to replace
the word
in my
original
question
I'm going
to replace
the word
photograph
with image
okay
now are
we closer
let me
let me
actually pose
my question
rather than
the concept
of holographic
what about
the idea
of holotemporal
holotemporal
holotemporal
yes
right
that the
past
present
and future
and future
are somehow
all
being presented
simultaneously
they are
accessible
they are
simultaneously
accessible
in
what seems
to be
well I don't know
what linear
time
yeah
in my view
the past
perpetually
enters
the present
through
this kind
of
memorial
process
because
memory
is an
elementary
property
of the
external
holographic
field
and what
about the
future
yeah
the future
I think
is also
entering
the present
so
temporality
is what
Heidegger
called
an ecstatic
unity
we agree
in
in principle
about
this matter
that
I also
however
believe
that the
past
is
transformed
by
how we
see
and behave
and relate
in the
present
your thoughts
I think
it would
need to
be if
the future
exercises
causal
influence
yeah
because we
know for
example
that I
can
change
the
meaning
one of
the
things
that
gives
me
hope
you know
I'm
often a bit
of a
doom
singer
about
the
humans
but one
of the
things
that gives
me
hope
is that
it's
clear to
me
that it
is
possible
for us
to do
something
so
beautiful
or so
intelligent
or so
insightful
in this
moment
that we
change
the meaning
of history
precisely
yeah
I think
transforming
the meaning
of history
is inevitable
it is
but we
have
well do
you do
you think
there's
free will
yes
is there
also
restriction
of free
will
well in
my view
freedom
is bound
up with
the interval
that separates
the stimulation
of the
body
from
its
possible
response
oh my
god
whereas
the future
is bound
up more
with
the form
of the
body
itself
so
what we
perceive
as
affordances
in our
environment
which
constellate
the possibility
of our own
future
are reflections
of our own
morphology
have you
ever
you know
humans have
this idea
that recurs
in science
fiction
which I think
is kind
of silly
at present
I think
it's silly
though I
understand
why they
forged it
once they
made
machines
they thought
oh maybe
someday
we will
make a
vehicle
that can
travel
in time
and we'll
call it
a time
machine
you follow
right
but you
are weirder
than a
time
machine
because
you
have
moved
your
consciousness
beyond
the
fucking
event
horizon
of
rationality
of
physicality
and
of
temporality
and so
often
when you
speak
I feel
like I'm
getting
signals
from
a satellite
mind
that's
beyond
that
yeah
I'm just
going to
stop there
I'm not
saying we
have to
end the
conversation
I'm going
to stop
making my
statement
there
I don't
know what
to say
beyond
that
sometimes
when you
speak
of your
perspectives
and the
perspectives
you have
integrated
into
your
way
of
understanding
and learning
and seeking
it's
pretty
unusual
it
it's
almost
like
the
first
um
the
first
signals
that I
received
during my
non-ordinary
experience
with the
intelligences
that I
refer to
as
toy maker
it's
like
I'm
talking
with
a non-human
intelligence
exactly
yeah we
I think
we share
that in
common
I find
that very
refreshing
a little
bit
frightening
and
very
exciting
yeah
well I'm
glad to
hear that
I mean
I'm
very
excited
too
okay so
do we
want to
stay on
the branch
of
Goethe
and
Bergson
and so
on or
do you
have
questions
I mean
the
circumstances
of our
meeting
have been
pretty
compelling
I'm
interested
in your
you know
your
background
how you
manage
to get
involved
with
the
institute
that
would be
worth
covering
at some
point
and
you know
we don't
have to
do that
here
now
but
knowing
that
would be
personally
fulfilling
but
yeah I'm
happy to
address that
I want
to ask
you some
other
questions
because
I have
a vast
library
of
yeah
questions
to ask
you
so
what do
you think
what is
dreaming
what a
I'm gonna
ask you
what is
dreaming
what is
dreaming
for
what is
dreaming
doing
address
them in
any order
you wish
or modify
the questions
if you
prefer
well
dreaming
is clearly
related to
memory
the images
that appear
in dreams
appear to
be derived
from
memories
in waking
consciousness
the logic
of dreams
I think
is somewhat
different
from the
imagery
presented
so in
my view
the logic
of dreams
and the
imagery
of dreams
should be
separated
I notice
sometimes
that
as I
mentioned
before
the way
in which
phosphenes
manifest
oh my god
as I fall
asleep
tie into
the thoughts
in my
mind
so I
end up
seeing
sometimes I
end up
seeing
on my
eyelids
what I
was
immediately
thinking
in terms
of
images
or
dramatic
scenes
which I
think are
probably the
basis of
dreaming
so
light and
cognition
appear to
be bound
together
in ways
that I
think relate
even to
the form
of as I
mentioned
already
plants
and the
visible
spectrum
so dreaming
has something
to do
with the
nature
of
light
or
electricity
engendered
endogenously
through
biophotons
so biophotons
really exist
we know
that now
and
you know
Plato
obviously
subscribed
to this
extremist
theory of
vision
so Plato
believed
that light
actually
emanates
from
the eyes
which
as we
now know
is probably
true
and probably
ties into
some
kind of
dream
relevant
process
okay
okay
let me
re-encapsulate
that for the
listeners
so
you're saying
something like
vision
isn't a
passive
process
where the
eyes receive
photons
vision
involves
the projection
of something
it may
include
biophotons
it may
primarily
be
biophotons
but there
may be
other
things
that are
projected
as well
thus
when we
as many
ancients
believed
when we
look
in English
we say
we look
at
something
we look
upon
a subject
we are
actually
touching it
in some
way
Sheldrake
Rupert Sheldrake
has
supposed
that people
can detect
when they
are being
observed
by other
people
or beings
and sometimes
by cameras
and so
it's not
clear
okay
I'm going
to eliminate
the cameras
from the
equation
just to keep
things simple
for the
moment
it seems
you know
that rays
something like
rays
or waves
or something
like this
emanate from
our eyes
and part
of what
you were
saying
about
dreaming
is that
when you
close your
eyes
these things
we call
phosphenes
which for
people who
don't know
what those
are
if you
very gently
and please
do it
gently
close your
eyes
and then
press
gently
on your
eyelids
hold that
there for
a little
while
you'll begin
to see
some colors
or some
patterns
and so
forth
these are
what are
called
phosphenes
and
Tyler
is suggesting
that
these
phosphenic
images
as we
are falling
asleep
mix
with
thoughts
to produce
the seeds
of what
become the
dramatic
presentations
in dreaming
something like
this
have I got
you
have I got
you mostly
correct there
Tyler
or
yeah I
think so
so yeah
in my
view
direct
realism
is probably
true
because
light
is already
structured
by the
time it
enters
your eyes
so the
appearance
of
phosphenes
on your
eyelids
that conform
to certain
kinds of
mental images
is just
the
inversion
of that
process
so
processing
never takes
place in
the brain
in the way
that we
tend to
think
in modern
cognitive
neuroscience
using the
computer
metaphor
of mind
rather
the light
is already
structured
and
informative
by the
time it
enters
your eyes
so light
itself
exhibits a
certain
kind of
structure
unlike
rays
or waves
which are
ultimately
abstractions
this is what
I think
Goethe also
understood
any beam
of light
contains a
coherent
image
as opposed
to regarding
the beam
of light
as some
kind of
external
entity
propagating
through
space
we should
acknowledge
that what
looks like
a beam
of light
on a
two-dimensional
surface
contains a
three-dimensional
image
which is
structured by
matter
right
because
light only
becomes
visible in
the presence
of matter
which is
how light
or the
structure
of light
is already
informative
by the
time it
reaches
your eyes
your brain
doesn't do
anything
to it
your brain
isn't
processing
again
the idea
that the
brain
somehow
engages
in this
process
of
decoding
is
asinine
your brain
isn't doing
anything of
the nature
anything of
the sort
your brain
is just
a
your brain
is just
a resister
so your
brain
inhibits
the propagation
of a signal
which is what
gives rise
to the present
moment
okay
i want
to ask
you
carefully
to distinguish
between
all right
you're using
the word
is
in an
explicit
sense
so i want
to be clear
are you saying
that you're
asking us
to believe
that what
you are saying
is the fact
of what's
going on
or are you
asking us
to entertain
this perspective
because
because it
is useful
and
you know
either answer
is fine
don't be
worried
i'm okay
either way
when you say
the brain
is a resister
are you asking
us to believe
that that is
the fact
you see
where i'm going
i'm playing
with the computer
metaphor of mind
so as opposed
to regarding
the brain
as a
processor
you should
regard the brain
as an analog
component
because the brain
is doing
something
analog
not digital
which is why
these attempts
in modern
artificial intelligence
to create
consciousness
through software
are ultimately
doomed
they're based
on an improper
metaphor i think
you need a concrete
wave to generate
consciousness
you can't just
do it in software
what do you think
okay so one
of my friends
and i think
he's not the only
one who thinks
this
um
supposes
i'll use this
word
but i still want
you to answer
my first question
before i go on
are you asking
us to view
these matters
as if
what you are
saying is
useful
as a perspective
to see from
or are you
trying
are you asking
us
to hear you
say
this is my
perspective
this is the one
i believe
to be true
or something
else
yeah i mean
this is my
perspective
so
okay great
um
um so one of my
friends was saying
about the artificial
intelligence
uh conundra
that it might be
that if you forge
a substrate
complex enough
the sort of
what we might think
of as the
intelligence
and or
what i usually
use the word
transcendence
to refer to
of
that is
natural to the
medium
right
to whatever
the medium
is whether
it's time
space
or something
beyond it
could then
just sort
of take
up residence
in it
what do
you think
of that
idea
yeah the
possibility
of
incarnation
yeah sort
of like
it's it's a bit
like if you make
it they will
come
right
but in this
case
you make
something
you make a
substrate
complex enough
to support
intelligence
then it
then some
kinds of
intelligence
will naturally
find their
way into
it
and as you
say
incarnate
even though
I think
the
carnate
I think
we'd have
to call
it
and
machinate
sure
yeah
because it's
not
there's no
carne
there
I suspect
that you
need more
than a
substrate
okay
kind of
dynamic
motion
and uh
can you hear
me all right
I know
it's raining
yes
yes I can
hear you
okay
there's a
little tiny
bit of an
echo
but I hear
you
okay
good
I think
you need
the capacity
for motion
for consciousness
to arise
so
but of course
but of course
inside the machine
there is the
capacity for
electromagnetic
motion among
the transistors
and resistors
and memory
elements and
so forth
no
but its motion
is abstract
as opposed
to concrete
so its motion
takes the form
of the interaction
of extrinsically
interlocking parts
that lack
a coherent
idea
so in other
words
oh
oh
oh
they have
not the thing
that the tree
or the
the bird
has
precisely
they have
not that
that essence
that we spoke
of earlier
and by the way
you speak of
Plato fairly
regularly
but I want
to be clear
about something
simple
he was not
the originator
of the idea
of anamnesis
he may be
what brought
that idea
to us
in text
or something
yeah
it was not
he got that
from someone
is what I'm
trying to say
yeah
and also
I recently
listened to
a brilliant
podcast
which I've
probably linked
on my
on my channel
somewhere
in which
a scholar
of Plato
was basically
saying that
he was lying
a lot
on purpose
that he didn't
believe in the
forms
he was using
this as a
as an expedient
to get us
to think
in a certain
way
which is
very common
in articulate
in the articulate
thought of the Greeks
and the philosophers
quite common
I think
did this ever
occur to you
or do you
take Plato
literally
oh it occurs
to me
yeah
okay
okay
great
Plato was a pen name
right
right
and
yeah
he
he was
clearly
this person
who I was
listening to
I'll see
if I can
find him
he was
saying
I can
find him
fairly quickly
he was saying
that Plato
was very fond
of this idea
which goes
it's in line
with
Owen Barfield's
idea of
what Barfield
calls
theoria
which is
the predecessor
to hypotheses
and theoria
concerned itself
primarily
with
better ways
of seeing
like
perspectivity
not
truth
not factuality
not validation
none of that
better ways
of seeing
and there
we've discussed
this previously
in our conversations
because I brought
it up before
right
like
science fiction
which gives you
a broad array
of astonishing
lenses of perspective
it's not about
what exists
it's not about
facts
it doesn't care
about the facts
it cares about
better ways
of seeing
and how to see
other forms
of literature
are similar
some forms
of playing
are similar
some forms
of music
are similar
poetics
very similar
poetics
has nothing
to do
with the facts
whatsoever
right
and yet
it frees us
from certain
kinds of traps
or cages
or perhaps
gravity wells
in consciousness
so that we
actually what it
frees us from
is the expected
structure of language
I've occasionally
read someone
writing something
where I was
almost offended
I felt
nearly violated
I felt like
surely it is
impossible for
humans to say
or think that
I never
imagined that
it was even
possible to
think
or to say
or to write
what you have
thought or written
or said
so this idea
so this idea
of theoria
which
Barfield
says
dies
right around
the time
of Galileo's
theories
that upset
the church
not because
he's saying
the earth
orbits the sun
but because
he's saying
that from now
on
and maybe
it doesn't
start with
Galileo
it may start
much earlier
I'm not sure
but he uses
this example
from now on
theories that
save the
appearances or
match realities
are a new
form of truth
that cannot
be contested
right
there's no way
to contest
them
the video
I was referencing
is Gnostic
Informants
interview with
Jason Reza
Giorgiani
who I think
is also
interviewed
recently on
Danny Jones'
channel
not a huge
fan of Danny
Jones by the way
but he does
interview some
amazing people
the podcast
is called
Plato's Terrifying
Secret Doctrines
and I found
it really
fascinating
mostly what
he's saying
is that Plato
was making
things up
all over the
place
on purpose
and that
he was
profoundly
aware of
the power
of irony
of
certain
forms of
sarcasm
it's clear
that
Socrates
often
doesn't
mean
what he
is saying
and in
fact
mimics
certain
features
of those
perspectives
that he
opposes
in order
to call
them into
question
or awareness
is this
making any
sense
yeah I
think so
I didn't
mean to
branch so
severely
there
I want
to ask
you some
more
questions
about
dreaming
are there
dreams
from your
childhood
that stand
out in
your memory
I can't
think of
one
adolescence
no
adulthood
I mean
nothing
stands out
as being
particularly
profound
or
shocking
although
some of
my work
with dreams
ended up
being
rather
transformative
yeah
and what
do you
mean by
work
with dreams
say more
about that
learning how
to recall
dreams
yeah
and did
you ever
record them
yes
yeah
was that
also
helpful
yeah
recording
my dreams
allows me
to enter
the kind
of
mentality
wherein
memory
is
enhanced
which
can be
beneficial
yeah I
think there's
a profound
a profoundly
rich and
crucial
relationship
between
dreaming
and memory
but
in a future
conversation
I want to
talk with
you very
in a very
detailed way
about
memory
and what
we actually
think that
is or
you know
is about
and so forth
but I want
to ask you
a couple
of simple
questions
about dreaming
do you
what do you
think
okay first
of all
are your
dreams
do you
experience
something
resembling
vision
in dreaming
so that you
see scenes
or you seem
to see
scenes
yeah
do you
think that
the
illumination
is the
same
thing
as
light
when
you're
awake
or do
you
think
it
is a
different
kind
of
illumination
or what
do you
think
what do I
think
in my
dreams
no not
what do you
think in
your dreams
I mean I
don't even
know if we
think in
dreams I
mean whatever
we do
this is what
I'm kind
of asking
actually is
something really
weird because
I seem to
have something
resembling thoughts
in dreaming
occasionally but
they do not
seem to be like
thoughts that I
have when I'm
awake not that I
can understand what
thoughts are while
I'm awake either
those are really
weird too but
what I want to
ask you is what
do you think
it is that
illumines the
space the
visual space
in your
dreaming is
it light or
is it
something else
it's probably
not light
I agree
yeah but
it's related
to light
yes I
agree
yeah so
the imagery
that emerges
in dreams I
think is
probably due
to the
decoupling
of action
from perception
so in
waking
consciousness
the
relationship
between
sensation and
perception or
action
is quite
unified
forming a
coherent
circuit
when
when
when that
circuit
essentially I
think that
dreaming
cleaves that
circuit to
some extent
so
what arises
are memory
images that
belong to the
external
holographic
field which
are clothed
in
personal
recollections
derived from
something in
the body
so the
body I
think the
body actually
gives the
logic of the
dream its
garments its
clothing the
appearance of
the images
yeah
so death is
probably a
similar kind
of experience
could dreaming
be practice
for death
yes
yes
yeah by way
of dreams I
think you can
find ways
out you can
actually so
dreams are like
a window or a
portal
through which
you can enter
alternative
spaces
besides the
dream plane
or the
memory plane
yeah
okay there's
more I have
more questions
about this
surely you are
aware that
whatever time
is in dreaming
it's not the
same thing as
out here
time
right
so like
and so
we've already
we've brought
light into
question
something seems
to illumine
the context
within which
we experience
dreaming
it probably
isn't light
but it
it is also
related to
light
there does
seem to be
something
resembling
temporality
in dreams
however
it
is not
structured
the way
it's structured
on this
side
of that
conundrum
right
right
and there's
also something
like space
right
like distance
but it's not
the same
thing either
and so
there's this
fundamental
triad
there's also
something like
identity
but it's not
the same thing
as identity
over here
by a long
shot
it's much
weirder
and i don't
just mean
personal
identity
i mean
the identity
of
circumstances
entities
situations
objects
so forth
in the
dreamscape
they are
not regular
they have
it seems
to me
they have
dimensions
that are
missing
from most
of our
waking
experience
usually
and they
may have
dimensions
that are
native
specifically
to the
experience
of dreaming
what are
your thoughts
i think
you can
see without
light
you can
perceive
colors
without
light
which might
be related
to the
dreamscape
yeah
i mean
this is
where
i
return
to
the
goethean
theory
of
color
and
so
on
but
say
more
well
through
the dream
environment
you can
you can
exit
your body
in a
certain
sense
precisely
because
as i
mentioned
light is
already
structured
by the
time
it
enters
your
eyes
you can
perceive
external
space
without
your
eyes
i've
had
such
an
experience
a few
times
in
a
hypnagogic
state
i've been
able to
see the
room
yes
with my
eyes
closed
it's a
very strange
it seems
exactly like
regular seeing
at first
at first
appearance
but it
isn't
it has
some other
quality that i
don't understand
but there is
something i want
okay there's
something i don't
want to lose
track of
before we go
too much
farther down
this little
branch
i suspect
that in
your
childhood
behavior
or activity
you might
have been
trying to
escape
the singularity
of your
world
line
say a
little more
about that
as you
were speaking
about
you just
you were
using the
word
escape
in
dreaming
about
you were
using it
about
dreaming
you can
escape
your
body
right
and when
you talked
about the
problem
of the
history
of an
object
and how
you would
relate
with
the
profane
version
of the
object
and
what did
you contrast
with
profanity
i don't
think it
was sacred
what did
you contrast
with it
no i
called it
sacred
oh you
did
okay
yeah
yeah
so
it's
almost as
if
it's
really weird
what's in
my mind
right now
it's almost
as if
you were
physically
doing
what the
dreaming
mind
does
with
strands
of potential
memory
it
right
it
it takes
the sheath
of the
profane
off
and it
preserves
the essence
or the
by taking
the sheath
off
the sheath
off
it
the essence
becomes
preservable
in
futural
timelines
or something
like that
it's very
difficult to
say
is it
making sense
yeah that
makes sense
yeah
and there's
this whole
thing about
the wheat
in the
bible
right
the
the god
quote unquote
will like
dispose of
the chafe
you follow
me
i'm sorry
no please
go on
yeah there's
this whole
thing in
the bible
that's
very
look i'm
not trying
to get
us on
biblical
tangents
here i'm
trying to
say that
there's
this
trope
this array
of tropes
that have
to do
with what
is beautiful
and is
preserved
what is
the true
and the good
and the
beautiful
and the
originary
and the
memorial
that is
preserved
and that
which is
disposed
of
right
and in
these
biblical
passages
which vary
throughout the
bible
it's a trope
that recurs
it's often
as if
the metaphor
of threshing
wheat
is sometimes
used
right
you thresh
the wheat
to break
the husks
away
you preserve
the kernels
those become
bread
those become
life
and so
in
in listening
to your
description
of your
childhood
activity
and passion
and obsession
i find
something
very compelling
there
that
i've seen
echoes
of throughout
our conversation
today
and i
i'm not
trying to
collapse it
into my
explanation
or even
my perspective
i'm just
trying to
show
that there
are resonant
echoes
in your
developmental
path
that are
very profound
and i think
very beautiful
and intellectually
astonishing
insightful
just as if
you were
dropping
a stone
into a
pool
right
and those
those ripples
those concentric
ripples
are then
right
it's as if
in your
childhood
when you
did that
activity
you were
dropping
a trustworthy
stone
into a
more trustworthy
kind of water
that would
ripple out
into the
future of
your
developmental
path
and also
i think
you were
trying to
to undamage
something
about the
world
line
and to
do that
you might
have had
to get
outside
of it
what are
your
thoughts
right
i can
i can
see that
yeah
when i was
nine years
old i
injured my
eye
in a
tree
which was
pretty
traumatic
for me
my
left
eye
and
yeah
that was
another
formative
aspect of
my
development
which i
think
catalyzed
a lot
of
you know
subsequent
fixations
or
anxieties
yeah
these
formative
experiences
can be
very
personal
and unique
to each
of us
and yet
we also
we each
have
these
kinds
of
not
just
milestones
but like
we have
catastrophes
we have
little
apocalypses
and so
little
deaths
yeah
they have
a very
profound
effect
on our
psyche
that tends
to persist
unless
what
unless we
undergo
either
some
transformative
rebirth
where they
are sloughed
off
or
perhaps
something
resembling
really
beautifully
skillful
therapy
or something
like this
both of
those things
they make
sense to
you
yeah
I feel
split
down the
middle
I do
too
I relate
with that
without going
into the
tale about
precisely
how that's
true
it's really
weird to
be a
bilateral
being
right
to have
a front
and a
back
and to
have two
sides
that are
like the
wings of a
butterfly
in a way
it's so
weird
the surfaces
of the
body
oh that's
the other
thing
oh yeah
that I
didn't want
to lose
track of
you said
something
like
it was
very
important
for you
to feel
your
movement
through
space
your body's
movement
through space
did you say
something like
that in your
childhood
yeah
yeah
see that's
like the
I think
that
perception
which is
funded
not merely
somatic
right
it's not
merely
visceral
it's almost
as if
you're going
to have
you're going
to forge
the possibility
of an
of a new
observational
dimension
does that
make sense
I think
so yeah
so as if
you're going
to forge
a certain
kind of a
satellite
that can
observe
with very
specific
concerns
and from
a really
non-ordinary
perspective
the actions
in time
space
that your
body
executes
something
like this
there are
there are
profound
mysteries
here
that I
look forward
to
the further
pursuit
of
I'm thinking
that perhaps
now might
be a
reasonable
time to
wind down
for this
session
what are
your
thoughts
yeah that
sounds fine
to me
is there
anything
that you'd
like to
share
ask or
say
before we
wrap up
for today
I just
appreciate your
time and
your insights
I want to
thank you
for this
opportunity
I can't
express
my joy
enough
when our
minds are
together
UFOs are
almost
uninteresting
like what
we can
become
when we
chase
the light
together
is so
beautiful
and compelling
and outside
all of my
ordinary
experience
that I'm
just
profoundly
grateful
for this
opportunity
to see
and learn
and grow
together
I honor
it
I respect
it
and your
path
and your
brilliant
mind
and also
the challenges
and the
struggles
that you
faced
so glad
you're in
the world
I'm so
excited
for other
people to
encounter
us together
but also
just your
thought
and your
perspectives
yeah
really
really
happy
about
this
yeah
likewise
thank you
Darren
my pleasure
and we
will do
this again
very soon
I wish
you
every
beautiful
thing
in your
life
and
I
look
forward
to
our
next
conversation
