Hello, everybody. Welcome. I have just reattached my wind buffer to my wired Apple headset microphones, or microphone.
It's not particularly windy, but I'm sort of pleased with the simple solution of wrapping a cotton ball around the mic and securing it with a, um, there's probably a formal name for these objects, but a bread wire.
Right. Those little wires. But sometimes, um, close the bread package. Hmm. A lot of contrails in the sky today.
I suppose there are people who suspect that every time they see a contrail, they're seeing, uh, what? Chemtrails.
Um, pretty sure most of those contrails are just vapor, caused by vapor. Um, the engines heat the air, makes a vapor trail.
Well, there might be occasionally in some places, some things that aren't contrails, but I strongly suspect that people who spent their lives watching aircraft and contrails would alert us.
Um, I know this is a very controversial topic that borders on the conspiratorial, um, but there are other strange problems like, I guess, maybe my objection isn't as strong as I once thought.
But this often turns out to be the case. But one of my simple objections was, if somebody's spreading some kind of chemistry in the atmosphere itself, and they're doing that on purpose, it's going to affect them and their children and their children's children and so forth.
I suppose it could be that, um, they don't have any children and they don't care.
Oh, this is strange. This is the second bit of a carcass that I've seen today, and it's interesting because I almost never see bits of carcass and I walk here every day.
Is it just that today I'm noticing what I don't notice? Or is today a bit of carcass day? I just don't know. Um, they're rather disgusting. Little chunks of fleshy, bloody gristle and fur and things.
Um, certainly unappetizing.
I don't necessarily have a plan for this talk today. We'll see where it goes.
Um, I was thinking about some things.
Uh, various kinds of magical intent.
Um, the transactional kind where you trade something, uh, often, or sometimes, this is apparently whatever is referred to by one's soul, for some boon or benefit in the short term.
It seems like a wildly stupid idea to me. Hopefully I haven't accidentally done that myself.
Um, and the kind where you employ...
Wow, what is that sound?
Oh, it's a bird.
Oh, it's a baby bird.
It's a feed me sound. Oh, okay.
Um, there are two fundamental, uh, principles of something resembling our idea of magic.
Which, let's face it, it's, um, it's get or accomplish something without physically having to do the thing.
Or, you know, chase the thing or something.
Something like this.
So, in traditional Blackfoot knowledge, the language is problematical because what magic means in English is a broad array of things.
Or, actually, magic doesn't mean anything in any language.
It's just a word.
What actually happens with words is that we use them to mean things to each other in actual conversations.
Unless we're not having conversations and we're just saying things.
And this becomes very confusing very quickly because then the presumption that words have meanings begins to pervade.
We have to interpret the gap.
What gap?
The gap of no relationship.
No, no pre-existing context.
Random context.
And so forth.
There are ways in which that situation can become useful for us.
But only if we deal with it very insightfully, intelligently.
And what do I mean?
The randomization of language is a kind of a paramagical substrate.
And what am I trying to mean by magic?
Well, I'm not trying to mean illusionists' tricks.
Fascinating though they are.
And I'm not trying to mean the mere manipulation of the vulnerabilities in human thought and consciousness.
I'm trying to mean something more like perhaps what people usually very naively mean with the word manifesting.
An idea that I fundamentally mistrust.
Or maybe it's just the language that I mistrust.
Or maybe I'm ill-informed.
Which isn't as rare as I might like it to be.
Yes, I'm not, as my listeners know, a big fan of the secret.
Or the various cults that derive their central premises from such ideas.
At the same time, there is something to a kind of envisioning or dreaming of the future that is very powerful.
The question is, is it as trivially silly?
Like, what happens when you make that idea explicit is one of the questions.
Because there's a fundamental difference between peripheral vision and foveal vision.
Between explicit identity and potential identities.
And in that blur, there's something transcendentally momentous and powerful.
But if we make the blur explicit, irony often results.
Meaning, direct contradiction with stated purposes, goals, hopes, desires, intentions, cautions, and so forth.
And so, perhaps what actually bothers me about the manifesting cults.
Is that they're taking something that I suspect properly belongs to the peripheral.
And making it foveal.
Your foveal vision is the center, center vision.
It's what you use when you look at something.
Whereas your peripheral is what you use when you spread your gaze and take in the whole.
Right?
And as some of you know, that if you gaze at the night sky, when you look at stars, you can see the stars visible to your foveal vision.
When you look toward them.
I'm getting a little wet there.
If you spread your gaze, you will see stars that will literally disappear if you look at them.
And this is kind of what my concern is.
As well as a sort of ideological trivialization of destiny, dreaming, visioneering.
Mmm, yes, yes, yes.
The scent of the herbs.
Beautiful.
So, yeah, I'm getting somewhere near what sticks in my craw.
And the weird thing about this problem for me is that by explicitly pointing at what sticks in my craw, I, you know, this is part of the problem with thinking and part of the problem with language.
Once I think I have a sense of what might be going on, I tend to become kind of clingy about that.
And in that clinginess, well, you know, it's not always conflicted, but it's often produces significant conflict.
So, yeah.
Mmm, sage flower, scent, yum.
In Blackfoot, the two principles are similitude and contagion.
And they mix together.
They mate, they bond.
They form very powerful abilities, you might call them, as well as faculties.
I'm not going to lecture about that today.
So, these two principles are also found in other magical traditions, such as voodoo, hoodoo, various witching ways.
And perhaps also shamanism.
Resemblance is a way to understand similitude.
And similitude is a very sophisticated word that my friend Ryan First Diver uses.
Contagion is fairly obvious.
In a way, to refer to something directly in consciousness can often be a bit of a trap for us.
Whereas to suggest it, it's much more powerful and in a sense magical, by which I mean transcendentally potent.
Historically, women, females, are masters of indirect communication.
Suggestion, entrancement, which places consciousness into a sort of a flow state that can then be directed.
Or shaped, or both, redirected, and so forth.
Yesterday, at this spot, there was a young woman sitting on a log up above me and she was practicing playing a particular kind of flute that appeared to be made of wood or possibly bamboo.
I sat down, you know, without gazing directly at her because, once again, explicit attention produces problems.
Or, you know, it's occasionally appropriate.
Usually, if we're paying direct attention to something, it's often that we have the desire to capture, possess, or manipulate it.
And nobody really wants to be captured, possessed, or manipulated.
There's that explicitness in language again.
Of course, sometimes we do.
Or sometimes we partly want that.
Or an aspect of us desires this while other aspects of us flee from it.
This is the stormy cloud of what it's like to be human.
I've made it to the high view.
And there's that thing that looks a bit like Wardenclyffe Tower, but is actually the emergency public broadcasting speakers.
The peripheral and the foveal.
You know, dreaming consciousness largely corresponds to the former.
Waking consciousness to the latter.
Without being explicit, allow me to suggest that in the daytime, in bright sunlight,
the sunlight declares the color and identity of objects and situations.
What they are doing is obvious.
It's explicit, relatively explicit.
Whereas the moonlight, if it's there, or even the total darkness.
In total darkness, it's pure suggestivity.
Right?
You can't, you don't know where anything is.
You can tap your way along the path with a stick if you're lucky, or skillful, or practice that.
If you're very witchy, you can run in the darkness.
I've never known someone who can do that.
I can usually perambulate.
I've heard of people who can run in pitch darkness.
Having practiced a kind of a non-ordinary sensing array that is natural to humans and animals, but rarely...
Hmm, siren.
Terrible noise.
Dominates the entire oral sphere.
Hmm.
Thankfully, most situations are highly temporary.
Um...
The moonlight suggests rather than declares identities, and thus pareidolia...
I don't really...
I need to look up exactly how to pronounce that word.
Um...
But the, uh, imaginative experience of shapes and faces in, for example, the whorling bark of trees,
or the, um, the texture of the surface of the trail, um, or the clump of bushes that just happens to be in a shape that looks like a raccoon, and you can't at first tell it isn't.
Right?
So there's this dichotomy between suggestion and declaration.
It's very, uh, profound.
Um...
And similarly in dreaming, because in dreaming, things, beings, and situations, you know, we may later decide, oh, that was my brother, that was our house, that was this, that was that.
But in the actual dreaming experience, it's not really like that.
A house that's quite different from mine can be my house.
My sister can be a man.
Uh, all kinds of strange, um, what, amalgams of possible and actual form, identity, function, behavior ensue.
Usually when, I don't know, when those jays are making that noise, there's often a raptor nearby, but maybe not.
It doesn't sound as chiding.
It sounds more like, um...
Yeah, I think so, too.
Here I am, here I am, I'm over here.
Although that looks like a raptor tree to me.
That's, uh, Stellar's Jay.
Making the calls.
See, there's that thing, right, of explicit categorical identity.
So there are kinds of magic that don't really require trades, right?
They're not transactional.
And by magic, in this case, I mean the, hmm, the curation of time, space, and relationships.
In the hope of producing the resemblance of desired, uh, situations, transformations, relationships.
Without manipulating them directly, physically.
Although, some kinds of physical activities, such as ceremony and or ritual.
Whether they are formal or informal.
May be involved.
You know, one can envision, very formally by deciding, I'm going to sit in this place, which is powerful.
And envision.
But then, you know, think about, okay.
So, when you go to sleep, dreaming tends, for many of us, some of the time, to resemble breathing.
It just happens.
It happens, it's as if it happens to us.
And also within us.
Now, one can then form intentions around dreaming.
For example, the intention to dream about a specific thing.
Or the intention to, uh, the request that the dreaming aspect helps us better understand the situation.
Or experience a transformation of some kind.
Or gain what we think of as information about something that's otherwise difficult to know about.
Um, as if the dreaming mind has powers that are oracular and transcendentally seeing.
And I think, um, it does.
The dreaming mind is an array of faculties.
And also, some things we might think of as functions.
Um, meaning, it does stuff.
Important stuff.
Um, regenerating the organs.
Um, cleansing the metabolism.
Um, transforming the energetic, uh, situation in the body.
Um, what we might think of as spiritual energies or soul energies.
Or life energies or electromagnetic, subtle electromagnetic stuff.
Um, all of these things the dreaming mind is naturally skillful with.
And it does its job, much like our heart and lungs do, without much instruction.
But it can also be instructed or skillfully developed.
Much like our breathing.
Perhaps like our heart rate.
Certainly like our habits of thought.
So, we can have the formal intention to vision near futures.
Um, and there's, but I remember when I was younger, the informally visioneering futures.
And they, they, many of them came to fruition.
But there was a mix, right?
Like I formally wanted to play the guitar.
I formally wanted to be a graphic designer.
I formally wanted to publish texts.
Um, I formally wanted to, to be a good fisherman.
Even though I don't really eat fish.
Uh, I formally wanted to have an ass like Robert Wagner's.
That one sort of came true, which I think is ridiculous.
Although now I'm old and it doesn't matter much.
Um, I kind of, I formally wanted to be a secret agent.
I informally, now all the things I formally want, I also informally wanted.
I'm not sure why I have such a antipathy toward the formalization of certain kinds of things.
Um, perhaps I'm not really concerned about their formalization.
I'm concerned about the way that cults, uh, utilize formalizations of principles and wisdom.
Um, um, to capture and abuse people.
To disempower and blind them by giving them the wrapping paper instead of the gift.
Um, yeah, I don't like that.
Although, sometimes it can be very helpful, and this is hard to understand at first glance.
We'd like to have societies and situations that are so fundamentally enlightened that we just go,
we just climb the ladder together beautifully and successfully toward self-development,
mutual development, insight, skillfulness, awareness, wonder, awe, play, joy, comment, you know, humor, eros,
all these things we just, we just climb the ladder together and are constantly lifting each other above,
you know, positions previous or at least into harmonious balance,
where health and vitality and rejuvenation and, uh, resurrection are natural, um, features of the situation, right?
Of course, we all hope for this, but in our actual situation,
sometimes we may, it may be useful to fail, right?
Talked about this before, the power.
Or, imagine a situation where everything you do succeeds the first time.
And so it requires very little effort, and there's, it's going to be extremely difficult to improve, right?
To experience a gain in skillfulness or ability or function.
In order for that to happen, there has to be the possibility of making mistakes,
and perhaps of pain and suffering, confusion, ignorance, all these things.
So it can be very useful, at least in theory, to become enamored of a cult.
Um, I have, before, and, you know, we join the cult, we are enchanted by it.
It's very compelling because suddenly we have a belonging,
we have an experience of belonging that can be otherwise quite difficult to, um,
in our modern, in our common modern situations.
Worst, worst common denominator talk here, but in our common modern situations,
it can be very difficult to find a coherent groups that are doing something amazing and beautiful to belong with.
And so, um, this is part of why, even though education is a kind of a disaster,
it's also very, you wouldn't necessarily just want to get rid of schools.
Um, clearly, one might want to, uh, what, mediate, you know, positively mediate and transform, um, the existing institutions.
But the schools are very important because they give young people and the teachers and others, um, the experience of belonging together.
Uh, and so to the cults and so to the various, um, petals on the strange flower of fandom, right?
Musical groups, films, sports teams, um, also the usually lethally in more ways than one motivated, uh,
military, um, cohorts and such. Yes.
Hmm.
Belonging.
And obviously we get all kinds of pandering around this.
Social media panders to this desire to belong and delivers largely counterfeit representations, right?
We steal the real thing is stolen, ground up, compromised, essentially destroyed.
And then we are sold a broad array of ever less rich and powerful counterfeits.
This is the common thing that happens a lot in our modern culture.
Now, when we come together with and for each other and we forge intentional social contexts and cohorts,
pods, if you will, like a dolphin pod or a primate pod or a whale pod,
then we have both a kind of natural immunity to these gambits
and the capacity to lift each other out of them
or even to manipulate them from within.
And this is the rather covert version of the possibilities of our human sociality.
And this can be done in various different kinds of ways.
It can be done in rather serious ways.
And it can also be done in more or less playful or game-like ways.
And these two can actually merge so that you can have playful games
that actually transform or ameliorate the ersatz humanity and ersatz community,
ersatz spirituality,
that is so pervasive in our modern experience.
It's not the only thing going on.
And when we're alone, when we're isolated,
it may seem like the entire context is just violations.
And this is what leads people to terror, agony, self-harm, suicide,
what we think of as madness,
which, you know, if you...
Madness is a fairly natural result of the constant exposure
to the kinds of double, triple, quadruple, or, you know,
myriad sorts of binds, right,
where that emerge in our experience
of the broad array of competing anti-cultures,
anti-nations, anti-societies,
that dominate, you know, corporations
that dominate our modern experience and concern.
And they are terrible, but they're not the only thing going on.
And in order to, you know,
it's not just that we discover what's going on
when we begin to form intentional communal groups,
even if it's only for a short period of time.
See, this is the key.
We can get escape velocity immediately
from all of this in a small group
with a shared intention to do so.
And we can sustain that over time
and give it a heartbeat,
and that can even reproduce other little groups
that bubble in and prosper
even in the counterfeit nightmares
that they arise from and perhaps against
and out of the desire to
transcend these troubling situations.
So there are forms of magic
that don't require trades or soul-selling and so forth,
that are very powerful,
and some of them are profoundly virtuous.
They are not composed for the sake of vengeance.
This is a very dangerous motivation, generally speaking.
It leads to a lot of trouble in almost every case.
They are not war machines.
They are not for personal,
primarily for personal gain.
They may not be entirely selfless,
though they can be composed
under such circumstances.
but they are resistant to capture
by selfish, manipulative,
or warlike motivations.
And they can also be profoundly
protective,
healing,
calming,
nurturing, nourishing.
and these forms arise
from an ache
that I suspect we all come
to human incarnation with.
And it's an ache for
the...
It's an ache for the positive version of justice,
which is the dissolution
of injustices
and their replacements
with virtues.
Now again,
if once either of these ideas
become highly explicit,
there's going to be a lot of trouble.
It's going to be a lot of trouble.
Most of the time.
If you're explicitly concerned with virtue,
this tends to produce irony.
If you're explicitly concerned
with harm or vengeance or war,
you're going to have irony.
cleansing,
bathing,
smudging,
naturing,
grounding,
getting your feet,
your bare feet
on the surface of the ground.
Surrounding,
you know,
going into nature,
going into the living waters
of the river
or the ocean
or the lake
or the stream.
These are potent
and powerful precursors
to the formation
of the kinds of intentions
that naturally become,
that naturally influence
without dictating
futures
and transformations
of situations.
You know,
I was speaking with someone
maybe about a week
and a half ago
and I asked him
if he had ever prayed
and he said,
you know,
I don't think I ever really got
the impression
that something was listening.
and that's a very rational
response,
sensible.
Why should we engage
in activities
whose effectiveness
we have no way
to determine?
Well,
you know,
that's one perspective.
But I wonder
if it ever occurred
to him
that whether or not
someone was listening
or something
was listening,
the transformational
effects
could be profound
either way.
They could be profound
neither way.
They could be profound
both ways.
They could be profound
even if there was
no way to understand
how or why
they were,
in fact,
profound.
because
somehow
our
behavior
transforms
our potential
and the fact
or fiction
of our explanations
in many cases
either doesn't matter
or can be
very limiting.
So,
yeah,
those are things
to consider.
You know,
we,
I heard once
that some president,
perhaps it was
Bush,
inaugurated
a study
of prayer.
it's like
attempting
to study
I don't know
something
that cannot
be
cannot be
detected
by the methods
we would
ordinarily
presume.
presume
I heard
this morning
of an experiment
done to
establish
what's called
the Weissman
barrier
in biology
a feature
of biology
that is certainly
wrong
and yet
has been
canon
for a very
long time
in modern
in terms of
modern science
and the
experiment
was
absurdly
stupid
and yet
everyone
supposed
that it
was one
of the
greatest
biological
experiments
that had
ever been
done.
Well,
perhaps not
everyone.
It was very
common to
suppose this.
Yeah,
so
I had people
pray
for sick
people and
so on,
people who
knew them
and people
who didn't
and
apparently
the study
produced the
result that
the people
who were
prayed for
were actually
less likely,
slightly less
likely to
recover
than those
who were
not prayed
for.
Experiments
and rational
thought and
science are
very powerful
tools.
Their scope
though is
quite limited
compared to
that which
is.
You could
say that
which is the
case but
that's
different from
that which
is.
Their scope
is different
from reality.
The scope
of rational
thought is
similar in
its limitations
to the
scope of
the physical
manipulation
of objects.
I can
move hammers
all I want.
Much of
my experience
cannot be
reasonably
affected,
cannot be
properly
transformed
transformed or
successfully
transformed
by my
manipulation of
hammers.
And if I
should fall
under the
delusion
that my
capacity to
manipulate
hammers
is the only
way for me
to achieve
true and
valid
belief
conceptual
or procedural
insight,
understanding,
then I'm
going to be
in a really
bad situation.
one imagines
someone that
is a boat
right but
specializes in
the formation
of the
skeletal
precursors to
the hull
and they
think this is
the only
important thing,
the skeletal
precursors.
You can't have a
hull without
these, so
they only
build skeletal,
you know,
they only build
the frame
and the frame
doesn't float
and they
think that
they are an
expert and
that they know
everything about
boats because
they do the
most important
thing which is
produce the
frame.
My
presentation of
the metaphor
was a little
sketchy there
but I think
you get the
idea.
This is similar
to the
overvaluing of
rationals,
frameworks,
models,
explanations,
theory,
experiment
and so on.
When one
does, when
we do
experiments,
we
try very
desperately
to evict
most of
what's going
on from
the context
so that
we can
control
the
resulting
context
and its
variables
well enough
to acquire
deterministic
knowledge
of cause,
effect,
futural
transformations.
and this
is a very
compelling
method
but it
can also
be
blinding
in
tests
to
determine
whether
things like
telepathy
exist.
They do,
I assure
you.
I am as
sure of
telepathy as I
am of
breathing.
very few
if any
of the
experiments
took a
fundamental
feature of
telepathy into
the experimental
context.
What is this
feature?
Intimacy.
Deep
mutual
concern
and awareness
which is
naturally
productive
of
various
forms
of
non-ordinary
awareness
and sensing
of the
state
needs,
thought,
concern,
desires of
the other.
Natural
between
mothers
who adore
their
young
and newborn
children
children
though it's
not merely
a matter
of the
young
and the
newborns.
Natural
between
dogs and
cats
and their
human
companions,
probably
other pets,
natural
between
certain
insects
and
humans,
birds,
reptiles
even,
and so
forth.
But you
know we
hear,
well there's
no evidence
of it,
nobody's
written a
paper about
that,
there's
nothing in
the literature.
I remember
one day I
was here at
this lake
talking with
an ornithologist
and I
explained that
by careful
observation I
had determined
how to
sex,
how to
determine the
physical gender
of geese,
the snow
geese,
white cheeks,
the Canadian
geese,
Canada geese
I think they're
called,
which by the
way I'm pretty
sure isn't
named after
the country,
I think it's
named after a
man whose
last name was
Canada.
I think,
I think I heard
someone saying
this,
they might have
been having
their friend
on, but yeah,
I explained
by careful
observation over
time, because
this is a
quest I
undertook, I
realized the
geese can
tell for
sure, each
other's gender
by sight,
right, and if
they can tell,
we can tell,
but in the
literature it is
claimed that it
cannot be
determined, it
can be determined
by behavior, but
not by appearance,
and I didn't
believe that, so
I went on a
quest, it took
me a few
years, it
wasn't until I
met an old
goose couple,
an older
couple, which
is very uncommon
in nature,
because old
geese don't
survive in
nature, but
in cities they
can, and
then in them
the distinctions
were highlighted,
exaggerated, and
so I said to
this guy, I
was like, you
know, there
are ways to
visually determine
the gender of
these birds, and
he got very
upset, and
literally said
there's nothing in
the literature
about that, and
I was like, how
about we just
look at some
birds together,
and let's see if
we can do it,
nope, it's not
in the literature,
there's no
evidence, right,
we hear this all
the time, there's
no evidence of
faith, healing, no
evidence of God, no
evidence of angels,
demons, I mean, I
would argue that
Facebook and
Google are pretty
strong evidence of
demons, not to
mention, you
know, many other
bizarre features of
our modern world,
if you decide to
not look for
evidence, or if
you decide that
previous experiments
not done by you,
explain for all
eternity what
exists, what
doesn't, what it
does and doesn't
do, what it
can and cannot
do, then you
have become
theory-blinded,
right, because
in point of
fact, you know,
we speak and
think as if
that which has
previously been
established is
continuous and
permanent, when
there's no
evidence of any
permanent thing, and
continuity is
relative, right, it's
not concrete, it's
relative, and the
nature of time
itself can change, the
nature of light can
change, the nature of
perceivers can change,
does change, if you're
dreaming, you're
still perceiving, so
it's very important
to be able to
distinguish between,
you know, there
might be stuff that's
nonsensical in a
dangerous way that we
should avoid, we
should naturally avoid
believing it, right,
acting as if it's
true, on the
other hand, life
and thought, our
bodies, our
relationships as
human beings are
fundamentally
experimental, the
fact that there are
concrete realities
doesn't mean that
all previously
known exemplars of
fact are the
concrete foundation
of our existence, or
are reliable guides
to futurity.
You know, what
Nassim Nicholas
Taleb calls black
swans, which are
previously unknown
phenomena, happen all
the time.
The current models of
time-space and such
are all come from
black swans, totally
on it, no one
expected that
Einstein was going
to come along
and go like, you
know, I think
this distinction
between space and
time, while seems
very obvious and
intuitive, is wrong.
And then our
Connie Hamed and
others of his ilk
came along and
said, you know,
this perspective
that time-space is
and must be
fundamental to
all that's going
on, not only
is unlikely, but
can't be the
case.
Black swans
come into
our awareness
and obliterate
and obliterate
previously
dominant biases.
And when they
do so, they are
usually liberating.
We gain new
degrees of freedom,
insight, wonder,
play, ability,
function, and so on.
The findings of
science, theory, and
experiment are
provisional.
They will be
overturned.
It's not they might
be overturned.
They will be
overturned.
And so we
should recognize
that the terrain
ahead isn't
the ignorant,
you know,
I'm not even
sure what to say.
That's a word I'm
looking for.
the crippling
suppositional
certitude that,
oh, we've
already determined
what a goose is.
And now we
know.
Well, I doubt
it.
The fact is, we
don't know what
anything is.
We have highly
provisional toys,
and when we
exchange those for
wonder and
curiosity,
passion,
insight,
something inside
us begins to
die.
You know,
what we have
mostly as
moderns is not
knowledge, it's
representation.
And representation
in language and
concept is
deceptively
powerful.
and it is
this deception,
this, see
here, here is
magic, right?
Here is magic.
Here is
transcendental
influence by
which we can be
captured and
manipulated.
what we have is
what we have is
something that
replaces intimacy
with tokens,
words,
maps, models,
hypotheses.
because actual
knowledge is intimate
like kissing.
And if you
experience the
inflowing and
indwelling of this
knowledge, it will
not be like
thinking, it will be
like orgasm.
it will be like
kissing, it
will be like
death, it
will be like
birth.
Some of you may
notice a radical
transformation in
the vector of my
my locution
or elocution.
But yes, science
is powerful,
but it is not
the arbiter
of meaning,
identity,
purpose,
value,
fact,
truth.
And we see
this kind of
refraction away
from science
in many
domains of
our modern
social experience.
the problem
with that
particular
refraction is
that some
of that
is a
weaponized
psyop.
Nations
are experimenting
with how to
kill each
other's
populations
with
information.
And so
we have the
mixture of
the truth
of the
danger,
for example,
of the
COVID
vaccines.
with
the
intent
to
deceptively
harm
populations.
Right?
The
this is very
common,
unfortunately,
in our modern
situation.
all my
father's life,
he thought he
knew what a
tree was.
And then one
day at the
mirror pool here
in this garden
near where I'm
standing,
I accidentally
enchanted him.
And we sat on
this bench where
a woman is sitting
now.
And he
began to have
what might be
described as an
emergence event.
and he
turned to me and
he said,
we have to
leave,
I'm dying,
I'm going to
become this
tree.
And he
was quite,
he was
simultaneously,
um,
hello,
nice to see you
today.
Nice to see you
too.
He
was
simultaneously
alarmed and
ecstatic.
He had never
had an experience
like this,
drugs were not
involved.
He felt he
was becoming
the tree.
And I
tried to
calm him,
I told him
it'll be okay,
we can leave
if we must.
He said,
we have to go,
we have to leave.
And then a
squirrel climbed
up his leg
and up onto
his shoulder
and he said,
see,
see,
even the
squirrel knows
I am a
tree.
This is
intimacy.
And
trance can
produce the
potential for
modes of
intimacy that
thought must
extinguish.
Speech is
very similar.
I was talking
with someone the
other day about
their dreaming
experience and
gosh,
who was it?
I'm trying to
remember.
whoever it
was,
he said,
I don't
think I
remember
speaking in
a dream and
I was wildly
unsurprised.
I mean,
I was partially
surprised because
most of us
think,
that's the
key word,
we think,
that we
have the
experience of
having
conversation,
many of us
have this
memory of
an experience
resembling
conversation
in dreaming.
and that
part's true,
it resembles
conversation,
but as it
moves more
and more
explicitly toward
the semblance
of speaking,
the manifold
that supports
the dreaming
is collapsing.
the intimacy
is disappearing.
One way to
end an
experience is
to speak
about it.
Think of
two people
passionately
kissing,
and one
of them
then,
for whatever
bizarre reason
of dissociative
confusion,
decides that
the most
important thing
in this moment
is to say
something.
the speech
ends the
experience.
Language is
deceptively
weird in
that we
think it
gives us
the power
to communicate,
it does,
but primarily
in the layer
of representations,
which is not
the same
layer as
experience,
and certainly
not the same
layer as
intimacy.
Where in
this mess
is science?
Right?
Science is,
in our time
at least,
daimonic.
And when I
was a child,
I wanted to
become a
scientist because
it seemed
that these
were the
people who
best knew,
who had
the most
complete
knowledge of
things being
circumstances,
origins,
futures,
and so forth.
And machines
were very
fascinating to
me because
it was as
if in my
previous
incarnations
these things
didn't exist
and now
they do.
And they
seemed quite
impossible.
Not even
a thing like
a zipper.
It's just
impossible.
How much
more impossible
is a thing
like a mouse?
You know,
humans can
compose a
zipper.
They cannot
compose a
mouse.
So you
see, this
kind of
representational
knowledge is
extremely
dangerous because
it evicts
us from
what I
would call
transcendent
participation.
and that's
where our
actual
spirit,
our
capacity
to forge
purposes,
beautiful,
noble,
and true,
and to
embody and
enact them
together arises.
Not from
knowledge.
From
participatory
intimacy.
You know,
we,
because we
are embodied
humans,
eventually,
one way or
another,
most of
us,
the last
majority of
us,
have an
experience that
we call
orgasm.
And for
some of us,
this happens
in childhood,
and for
others,
it's in
our teens,
and for
some,
it might not
be even
until our
adulthood.
And there
are more
life phases
than those
ones as
well.
But there
are experiences
of intimacy
that make
what we
think of
as orgasm
seem trivial
in comparison.
And these
are four
modes of
intimacy
and everyone's
going like,
wait,
what did
he just
say?
That's
not true.
No,
it's true.
You can
have,
there's a
broad array
of experiences
that are
normally,
well,
they are
very successfully
inhibited in
us moderns.
And there's
a broad
array of
similar
modes of
cognition,
the use,
the use,
the sort
of,
the reformation
or the
formation
of modes
of awareness,
consciousness,
things that
resemble thought
and so forth
that are so
different from
everything we've
ever imagined
and yet are
natural to
our kind
of being,
our form,
our humanity,
our animality,
our organismality,
our beingness.
There are
modes of
intimacy
so ecstatic
that you would
never trade
them for an
orgasm.
And this is
part of why
we hear
some mystics
singing the
praises
of
what?
The
ascetic
path,
the path
of
not
indulgence,
of non-indulgence,
the path
of chastity
or temperance.
And,
you know,
dreaming
really is
very,
very profound.
And in
dreaming,
there can be
modes of
adoration
and eros
that are
vastly beyond
what we are
inclined to
usually experience
while awake
or beyond
what seems
accessible to
us while awake
in our
life phase,
in our
development.
But what I'm
trying to get
at here is
that this
thing we
call
orgasm,
it is
in a
sense
a
hmm
there's
different ways
to say
to say
this
it's a
repercussion
of
participatory
intimacy
that can
be
physically
produced
and
since
our
first
experiences
with it
are usually
catalyzed
by physical
sensations,
rhythms,
rhythmic,
pulsing,
rubbing,
so forth,
we should
understand
that that
is a
lesser
stasis,
a lesser
exemplar
of something
for which
there is
a forest
of super
positions
above that.
And when
I was a
child and
I was
fascinated
with science
what I
didn't
realize
is that
I had
no way
to understand
this,
although some
people tried
to say
something,
maybe this
is why
the problem
ensued.
There didn't
seem to be
anyone whose
knowledge was
deeper than
the knowledge
of scientists,
but the
knowledge of
the poets,
of the mystics,
of the
philosophers,
of the
adoring
ones,
this
knowledge
makes
the
powers of
science
shrivel.
Oh,
they are
still mechanically
powerful and
may in fact
snuff our
planet and
our people.
Yes,
they are
physically
very powerful,
but where
is the
intimacy?
it is that
participatory
intimacy that
we hunger
for and
when we
hope
not
for
justice,
but for
the
diminution,
the
transformative
composting
of
injustices,
it is this
participatory
intimacy
that we
know,
we sense
would
thereafter
obtain
and
become
the
water,
the
many
forms of
waters
in which
our
hearts
and
histories
and
futures
could
then
swim.
We
poor
moderns
have named
nearly everything
and thus
evicted
all the
named
features
and
beings
and
relationships
and
situations
from
much of
our
experience,
if not
all of
it.
Yeah.
We
have
representational
knowledge
knowledge,
miles
deep.
How
tragic
for us.
That is
the
Alexandrian
library of
the skeletal
remains of
what might
have been
understanding
and insight,
medicinal
awareness,
transformative
ecstatic
participation,
magic,
wonder,
play,
awe,
virtue.
Virtue.
I'm walking
in the
botanical gardens
here.
Even though
this is a place
curated by
my extremely
confused at the
group level
species,
the living
beings here.
They form
a
manifold
over
the
strange
dead inside
evictions
that otherwise
prevail as
cities
trees and
roads and
shops and
buildings and
so forth.
And they
are ecstatic.
If we could
change our
way of being
in time,
this ecstasy
would flow
into and
through
and around
and between
all the
aspects of
our being
in such
a way
as to
draw us
into
transcendent
visionary
awareness.
And I
don't say
this because
I know
it.
This isn't
knowledge.
I'm on the
verge of
experience.
I'm on the
verge of the
experience of
what I hear.
suggest.
We are not
distinct in
the ways
our common
thought
suppose
or create.
And there
are games
afoot.
There are
missions here
so beautiful
that the
entire
history of
language and
knowledge
has nothing
to do with
them.
There's no
thing you can
formally know
that's more
interesting than
the kiss of
your beloved.
The flavor
of that food
grown by your
grandmother in
her garden
on endless
afternoons
as she
toiled
to make
the foods
the families
would consume
together
mostly in
distracted
confusion.
Especially
once
the
invention of
televisions
began to
become
dominant.
And think
for a moment
of what the
television is
replacing.
There's a
reason that
thing is so
compelling,
was so
compelling.
There's a
reason why we
have these
screens.
They are
counterfeiting
something and
if you think
just a little
bit you will
see what they
are counterfeiting
and what it
is, is
something
resembling
group
dreaming,
group
telepathy,
group
organized,
group
missioneering,
organized
group
anamnesis.
And this
is what we
must reach
for together
if we are
to retrieve
the faculties,
the
ecstasies,
the beauty
of our
origins and
natures and
potentials.
and that's
a mission I
adore and
do believe
in.
And if my
humble speaking
can contribute
then I will
have lived
this day in
a way worthy
of my
ancestors and
their dreams,
my progeny
and their
dreams.
Which dreams
must not
be euthanized
by thought
and language
machine,
modernity,
war,
prisoneering,
commerce,
tokenization,
representation,
eviction.
Eviction.
There are many
ferns here.
I've always
loved the
forms of the
plants.
Insects are
impossible.
Animals,
the organisms
on this world
are fundamentally
impossible.
if we could
take off
the staggering
burdens of
representational
cognition,
ecstasy would
naturally arise
because
we ourselves
are and
are surrounded
by
infinite
manifolds of
impossibly
beautiful
wonder,
organism,
origin,
spirit,
purpose,
the superposition
from which
the concept
of beauty
is derived,
the living
bubble
of being,
history,
and future,
and purpose
that naturally
imbues up
from the soil
and down
from the sky
like trees
and rain,
ecstatic,
originary,
true,
vital.
Oh,
how I
adore
these
organisms
and how
confused
I mostly
am
when
deprived
of that
fundamental
participatory
intimacy
which is
true
recognition
and
the explosive
anamnesis.
Thank you
for joining
me.
I'm so
grateful
to have
this time.
Take a
moment to
like or
comment or
ask a
question or
share
something
personal.
in this
way you
will
help
my
humble
efforts
reach
more
people.
May your
ways be
beautiful,
your hearts
be light,
and your
relationships
exquisite.
thank you
for joining
me.
I look
forward
to
learning
together
again
very soon.
Bye-bye
for now.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
