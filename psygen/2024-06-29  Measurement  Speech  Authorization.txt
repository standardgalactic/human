Hello, everybody. Welcome.
Hmm. It's Friday, the 28th of June. Sometimes time seems to flutter by.
With uncharacteristic swiftness. It's a warm and breezy day here. I have lately been
walking with my son quite a bit. He's a rather insightful chap.
And problematically, too intelligent for his own well-being. Thankfully, at this phase of
his life, most of his intelligence has turned toward making humorous comments. And he is
very funny about this. We've had a few adventures lately. Mostly minor walking adventures.
But I noticed something that I might explore a bit here today.
Which is that one of the most common inspirations for human speech, catalysts for human speech,
which turns out to be measurement, and particularly differentials in which it is apparent that some
characteristic or quality has departed from expected norms. Which, if you think about it, is a very strange
strange motivation. Since, in fact, normalness is a fiction. And it's a fiction of the statistical mean or whatever, right?
Like the average over the curve or, you know, these kinds of things.
So, the fact that something, wow, it's really windy today, or it's quite hot. It's very cold.
That food smells good. It's just basically almost all of these, much of our comments and speech is initiated
by evaluative behavior that is, that emerges from the noticing of a departure from norms. And so,
it's quantitative. Oh, there's a lot of this. Oh, there's not very much of this. Oh, that man has a big beard.
Or, you know, other anatomical features can excite the linguistic urge.
And yet, you know, the intelligent listener will notice that my concern is self-generating.
Because it arises from noticing, quantitatively,
what the origins of many comments, assertions, declarations, objections, and so forth are.
Mostly, it's just humans arguing about the quantification of perspectival experience, sensorial experience.
And I find this very strange. The degree to which this relatively singular concern
is inclined to generate speaking, including the speaking I am now doing.
Because obviously, in case I haven't made it entirely clear, this is a quantif-, you know,
this perspective or this awareness arises from quantitative evaluations of what generally produces speech,
what most commonly produces speech, and so forth.
So that's what I mean by it's self-generating.
And I'm not sure exactly why I find this fascinating.
I think part of what I find fascinating about it is that I had not become aware of it previously.
It's so blatantly obvious, once one sees it, it's very difficult to unsee.
And maybe a lot of human relational behavior itself is fundamentally related to
forming an evaluative milieu, cognitively, relationally, behaviorally, historically, futurially, measurement.
State checking, of any kind, is measurement.
When we meet each other and we ask, how are you doing?
We are catalyzing measurement.
Now, of course, when we ask each other about states and so forth,
the expectation is that we will report on our state.
How are you feeling today?
What's on your mind?
Would you like to engage in some behavior or other?
What do you see?
What are you thinking?
Do you remember your dreams from last night or this morning?
What is your favorite ex, record, band, film, actor, actress, hero, historical personality, and so forth?
We ask each other often about affinities and antipathies,
which generate, you know, those are profoundly involved in selecting both the criteria and the focus of our measurement behavior.
If I, for some reason, feel something touch my clothing while I'm out, I will check to see what did it.
But where I was going is that I think we were inclined to expect that reportage, right, reporting on the results of state checking.
We think that what we're going to get is a relatively honest and or clear measurement or description of qualities or characteristics.
But problematically, consciousness is very strange stuff.
And its mode transforms when measurement is catalyzed, initiated, pursued.
And this is something that doctors probably very quickly learn.
That a person's reports of their feelings or health situations are very likely to transform under the observation of medical specialists.
You know, when we think about human sensitivity to observation, what we are actually thinking about is sensitivity to being measured.
Either the possibility of being measured, which is very commonly a part of our concern, awareness, transformation and so forth.
Or the results of being measured, which is really what the fundamental concern appears to orbit.
Now, you know, I started out by noticing that while talking with my son, I would often comment on things, situations, something I'm seeing, you know, experiencing.
Where, you know, that's a big one, that's a small one, there's less here than usual, there's more.
And it's, you know, it's the quantification of characteristics or qualities, it's measurement.
But think carefully about how fundamental measuring is to cognition, relation, behavior, condition, and so forth.
The behavior that we moderns call shopping is an evolution of a broad array of behaviors.
Actually, it's not an evolution, it's probably a devolution of a broad array of behaviors that probably began with hunting, scouting, gathering.
Gardening, overwatch, right, guarding.
In fact, what you will discover if you look carefully at the basic principle of measuring in cognition, you may discover that there isn't anything else going on.
In fact, the idea that something is going on is a result of a measurement.
The things we call senses are actually modes of measurement.
When we shop, we're trying to obtain things.
We make determinations about quality, price, and so forth.
And there's a lot of, there's some philosophical locutions around.
Oh, that would be really interesting if this is what I think it is.
It certainly looks like it might be.
I've been looking for shakuhachis in them.
It certainly is what I thought it might be.
Alright.
There are so many Yumu-X, who do these on mycket Küche
uche stories happen to me.
I see the M gramsh.
And there's no triangle here.
It's on my phone after having a conversation thrown at all over the table.
I want to follow theàng-X.
There's a conexion study programmed to findbeans, aren't knif real or Gothic.
Thank you these people.
We open everything for us.
You can't�� only.
But they're complicated, who do could気 has been.
Maybe they say that they are wild.
The Yanisa running as usual.
The Yanisa running as jeune in front of the�inde.
The Yanisa risingument.
The Yanisa running as natural disruptions.
Yes.
The Yanisa running as beautiful as mine is calledгуca.
specifically looking for root piece shakuhachi's which is what that man is playing i haven't seen
one played in probably 30 years in public or anywhere um i started looking for one a couple
days ago and now there's a man playing one are these related i have to use measurement to determine
this right our whole idea and once okay so then you have the problem of measuring measurement which
is essentially what i'm doing in this conversation i am folding the concept of measurement back upon
itself so as to reveal features that might that we might be some of us sometimes because in order to
determine whether something's always going on or sometimes going on you have to measure it you see
um yeah i hope you can see how incredibly problematical this is or at least um if not
problematical fundamental
in one sense there isn't anything else going on and i'm not intending to even approach the concept
of the meaning of measurement in what we might think of as transphysical systems
i.e quantum mechanics and so forth
the whole there really isn't anything else going on but what is it that's going on and why
is measurement so fundamental
you know when we ask questions like which is kind of absurd we we need to ask a better question than
if a tree falls in the forest is there a sound and the reason we need a better question is because
do we mean
does the phenomenon that humans point at with the word english word sound occur or not that's one question
um
but another question is
more related to the language without a human there you don't have the human idea of sound
so clearly the human thing
isn't happening
uh
now
i'm pretty sure the first question is the one that was intended by bishop berkeley or whoever it was that
originally posed
that particular question but berkeley certainly wasn't the first to consider the problem
not by a long shot
the greeks must surely
have gone far beyond such relatively trivial considerations
in their attempts to understand the nature of
existence
consciousness
being
incarnation
souls
humans
animals
nature
nature and so forth
so forth
measurement
the other night
we were out with my close friend
for his birthday
um
no that's not true
hmm
i think it was the day before his birthday
and we were at an indian restaurant in my neighborhood
and he was asking us kind of interviewee questions
he had three questions about he had three questions that he was posing
one was what is your favorite book one was what is the book that most profoundly influenced
you and one was if you could cause a single book to be read by everyone
uh what what book might you select these are very interesting questions and please feel free to address these questions in the comments
i would be very grateful if you would do so
um log in you know make a comment answer the three questions
what is your favorite book
what is the book that most deeply influenced you or changed your life
and what book
might you
ask everyone to recommend
now we should all be aware that
rarely are such measurements as explicit as we imagine
when we are children if someone asks us what is our favorite ice cream flavor
we are likely to immediately answer with a single flavor of ice cream
uh mine no longer exists
um there's actually a group dedicated to this on facebook
it is
baskin robbins mandarin chocolate
i don't necessarily like oranges and chocolate
but and my actual favorite ice cream cone is a combination of two baskin and robbins flavors
mandarin chocolate and daiquiri
this is the kind of measuring information
that corporations companies and advertisers are desperate
to collect on us because
information like this can be used to psychographize us
and if you want a good understanding of the dangers of psychography
you could read a book called lexicon
can't recall the author's name at the moment
recent book sci-fi
excellent
um
metaphoric
uh
you know tangential highlighting of the dangers of
psychography
which is the classification of humans
by tendencies, inclinations, vulnerabilities, desires, antipathies
uh
reactivities
uh
reactivities
and
affinities
uh
however uh
determining favorites is much more difficult if we become sophisticated
um
because we
we generally become aware that
set and setting, circumstance, recent history
potential nearby future futures
all of these dramatically trans affect and transform
our
um
not just our state
but our
manifold of potential
uh
self
efflorescence
efflorescence
developmental
um
um
transformations
uh
likely near neighbors
to present
and nearby future
potentials
and so forth
and so forth
so
you know
humans
tend
to be
in
a multi-flowing
way
that doesn't much resemble a state
and this is why it's very difficult
for
doctors
and psychotherapists
and so on
to
it's very delicate to try to understand what's going on
with a human who is presenting to you
um
because you
it's
it's effectively impossible to subtract your own influence
this is why some therapists
um
particularly
particularly
Lacanians
might simply have the person just start speaking
and say nothing whatsoever during the entire session
effectively acting as a
a statue
right
um
um
um
similarly in science the goal is to subtract one's influence over the experimental situation
in a sense
in trying to ensure a kind of anti-measurement but eventually we of course discover that
when things are small enough
it's impossible to
to subtract
the influence imposed by observation
um
and what is meant by small enough well in this case it's the Planck length but
the smallness
the smallness
occurs long before the Planck length
if you really wanted to understand for example whether it was possible
to have um telepathic
or cognitive
you know
non-ordinary cognitive influence over living beings or situations
you might start with gnats
ants
house flies
creatures whose
complete locality
occurs at a scale
far simpler
and tinier
and tinier and faster
than yours
it turns out that small
usually equals fast
though you can flip the measuring protocols
if you want
so that small equals slow in some unique ways and large equals fast
but generally speaking
smaller is faster
what do I mean by that
um
well
you're probably not aware of
trillions of transformations per second
or per trillionth of a second
happening in your metabolism
at your scale
a meaningful event
has to have a fairly long temporal arc
for you to become aware of it consciously
conscious awareness is probably overrated
our cells
are doing unimaginable numbers
of
I don't know if we could say intentional
but successful
metabolic transformations per second
um
and when I say unimaginable I mean it
uh
to track the transformations of a single cell over a single second
as I understand it would require more computing power than the entire history of human thought and computation
combined
um
so they're fast
right
insects tend to have very short lifespans
smaller creatures live faster
if a lifespan is the measure of a temporality
then
we can see
for example
that the 24 hour lifespan of say a mayfly
is radically different from
the
70
now seem to be probably 50 or less year lifespan of a human
average human
average of course
um
and then you know we get to the problem of generalizations
averaging means and so forth
and so forth
uh
so
we have this word in English the word remarkable
which
we might understand to mean
catalytic
of
remarking
or
are these passion fruit
are they
i don't know
very spiky
see there's that thing i'm quantified like these are very spiky
uh
so remarkable
essentially means to depart from the ordinary
in such a fashion
as to initiate speech
speaking
declaration
all these things
right
so
variance
right turns out to be really fundamentally important
to everything about being human
thought
speaking consciousness awareness and so forth
now notice how these features of cognition
and thought undergo
the most radical forms of transformation
within the experiences that we call dreaming
meaning
and not entirely dissimilarly but very differently
under the effects of various modes of intoxication
i think few of us really take seriously
this
uh
the toxic phoneme in intoxication
we forget
we forget
because we are not particularly
um
historically minded
the
relative
origin
that
uh
that brings
these drugs
we call them
that
differentiates them from poisons
now most
pharmacologists know
that drugs are poisons
and what makes them medicinal
isn't some quality in the substance per se
as much as it is a combination
of qualities in the substance
and titration
which is
um
use the
uh
the measurement
of the amount of the substance
introduced to the body
the body
over a specific span
of time
by limiting the amount
you may get
euphoria
medicinal properties
healing properties
or comfort
you know
there's various kinds of properties
right
sedative
stimulant
lots of others
we could
use the whole list
it's not really necessary
but what determines
the sort of the qualities
experienced by the
quote patient
unquote
is both
the characteristics of the substance
and the characteristics
emergent
from
titrating the substance
over time
limiting
the amount
introduced to the body
over time
substances
if you don't limit the amount
over time
what you end up getting
is death
why are the botanical gardens
closed today?
it's Friday
let's find out
and by the way
you can see that
I had no plan really to go into the botanical gardens
but
are they actually closed in midday in June?
don't see anyone in there
closed due to coyote activity?
coyote activity?
okay that's absurd
that's absurd
that doesn't
I very much doubt that the gardens are closed due to coyote activity
I think the gardens are closed because they intend to assassinate coyotes
murder them
probably the children and the mothers
and the mothers
and yeah
there's no way that the gardens are closed due to coyote activity
they're closed due to human activity
against coyotes
almost certainly
you see language itself is an act of measuring
right?
what they're saying is there's too much coyote activity
but in fact what's really going on is that the human reactivity
has risen to such a
a frenzy
that
a community
you know
asset
which some people have traveled thousands of miles
to see on this day
today
in history
it's closed
there's zero danger
to humans from coyotes
let's be very clear about this
none
no danger whatsoever
coyotes know to stay away from humans
the problem is more
one of management
and or
you know
the coyotes are not supposed to be being observed
is the problem actually
and if coyotes are
frequently observed
then the humans collapse into
a bizarre
omnicidal frenzy
in which coyotes have to be killed
according to some
I don't know
what?
according to what?
well this is where the problem ensues
so
we were out the other night
with my
my roommate Michael
very brilliant
creative
young man
he's a mod on rufos
on reddit
and also on rcollapse
and built the wikis
for both of those
as well as the websites of jacques valet
and others
when I asked him what his favorite
or I don't know if it was his favorite book
maybe his favorite book
he said
dun dun dun
a book called
the most dangerous superstition
and I thought
that's a fascinating title
I wonder what the most dangerous superstition turns out to be
and by the way you can see the
the measuring
there
right?
because first you ask what's your favorite
right?
so there's some measuring going on
you go over the whole history of books that
come to mind in the moment
and then you select one that stands out a lot
somehow
and you
reiterate
the language
of its title
which is a pretty weird thing to do
when you think about it
because it doesn't
help you understand what the
content really is
it might
maybe help you understand a little bit
of what the topic is
so the most dangerous superstition
turns out to orbit
and I haven't read this book yet
though I think it's very much worth reading
and I strongly recommend it to anyone interested
it turns out to be that there's anything resembling authority
now that is a mind blowing
that is a mind blowing indication
very mind blowing
because everything that we moderns do
is profoundly mediated
by the supposition
or the response to the possibility of
or the direct experience of authority
or the direct experience of authority
even our own minds
they function by a series of steps
a series of steps
in which
authorization
is taking place
a cascade of authorization sequences
is really what
cognition becomes
it isn't like that when we are children
something very different is going on
it isn't like that when we are dreaming
something very different is going on
but while we are adults
this is most of what is going on
that we call
thinking
let that sit for a minute
in your consciousness
what are your thoughts
perhaps
five years ago
I have a single event
on my calendar
one
it's only one
everywhere on my phone
just one
I mean maybe I've put one or two
on there briefly since then
there's a single event on my calendar
which is
one afternoon
at this precise time
3 p.m.
five six seven years ago
I was walking
in the concourse
where I am now between the two museums
and
I went to one of the two remaining tunnels
here there used to be three
or actually
yeah there used to be three
were there four?
no
no no
there were three
one of them has disappeared into a parking garage
thankfully
two more remain
there's actually a third one
in front of one of the two that remains
or further toward what the
the north
but yeah in one of these tunnels
there was a
a man who had set up with his
tablet
on a music stand
and he was singing a cappella
ancient music
and it was one of the most beautiful things
I have ever heard in my life
I used to sing some things similar to what he was singing very long ago
I went into the tunnel where I do sometimes sing myself
very unskillfully compared to him
if comparisons
right are the important thing
because if comparisons are the important thing
we're not going to make music
we're not going to learn to drive a car
we're not going to learn to ride a bike
we're not going to learn at all because there's always going to be people
who are excellent at what we are mediocre at if we can do the thing at all
so yeah there's a calendar item
3pm Friday
which relates to this event
who knows how long ago
to remind myself to go back there and see
if he was there
again
as I am doing now
I have only done it maybe two or three times since then
but the item remains on my calendar
we are the most beautiful
we are the most beautiful
Yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
yes
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
Oh
He is not here.
I have never seen him again.
Often when I've met someone arbitrarily
who had a profound effect on me,
I deeply regretted, almost immediately,
not getting their contact info, right?
Like, can I, can we just be in touch?
Because you're doing something that's beyond,
it's right, it's outside the normal measurements,
and it really is affecting me,
and I feel a resonance with that.
I feel the gravity, the gravity pull.
I want to do this, I want to know this.
I want to be this together with you.
And so often, you know, we just meet,
there's some sort of a, what communication arises between us,
and then we depart.
And there's something beautiful about the transience of such situations and relationships.
Very beautiful.
But it's too easy for us moderns for our lives to become a kind of a desert of meaningful roles and activities, relations and behaviors.
And so it's important sometimes to not merely appreciate the moment but reach out across the gulf and recognize beauty and developmental momentum and efflorescence and joy, wonder, awe, play.
And make a connection that lasts,
however temporally limited our human lifespans may be,
at least in this one body.
Time, calendars, schedules, all measurings.
But what I was talking about earlier was authorization.
And the book that Michael recommended is a complex assault on the idea that there's anything resembling extrinsic authority,
which is, of course, the origin of the desire for,
the origin of the motivations for surveillance,
surveillance,
prison-earing,
war,
religion,
politics,
and so forth.
Right?
All of these are authorization gambits.
And it turns out that human cognition spins on a single axis and it is this axis.
If the point on which the gyroscope is spinning is authorization,
then the circumference of its spin element is measurement.
So these two fundamental principles will pay profound dividends
should we become willing and curious in our explorations of their nature's features
and particularly how we can modulate them or even suspend them.
Because the suspension of either of these two things,
authorization,
right,
which is sort of the idea of rebellion,
but rebellion tends to collapse ironically on its own
origins by
explicitly opposing something,
right,
which isn't actually freedom from it.
If you explicitly oppose something,
and let's face it,
there's some good things to explicitly oppose.
Right?
It's not like,
we should never do this.
But we should be very aware that when we explicitly oppose something,
for example,
the anti-war movement,
right,
it doesn't really have the effect that we thought it would
in most cases.
And in fact,
we're sort of making war on the idea of war and so on.
So,
there's the problematical potential for ironic inversion
when we explicitly oppose things.
That's,
again,
doesn't mean there's no useful,
you know,
if I see somebody hitting their child in the face,
I'm going to try to get in the way,
well,
I'm going to try to intervene somehow.
You know?
That was a dumb example,
but it does happen,
or even just hitting their child at all.
I try not to police other people's behavior,
but in some cases,
there are situations in which
I will begin to
depart from the principles of non-interference.
many of those cases are cases in which I feel triggered,
and thus become reactive.
And some of those cases,
like the other day,
my son and I were walking,
and there was a couple young men
sitting on a bench,
and clearly one of them was a graphic artist,
and he'd been drawing in his notebook.
And I just stopped,
and I said,
can I?
Is it okay if I just look at that for a moment?
That's amazing.
That's beautiful, man.
What you're doing there is just exquisitely beautiful.
Right?
And he was very excited.
You know,
it was good,
right?
If he had said no,
and had sort of retracted or pulled away,
I'd have honored that.
But I wanted to see and praise
and be excited together with him about his art,
which is one of the reasons I live in this ridiculous,
nonsensical city.
For the sake of art.
To what do we object?
I certainly object to the noise of that machine.
That sounds like a terrifying version of a lawnmower.
And I'm attracted,
inversely,
to the music of the bird song.
And the beauty of this old tree and its companions.
That I have long adored.
Here in Shakespeare Garden.
Where I learned my Tai Chi form.
From Paul Taylor and Guylain.
The Italian day.
The scent.
In this.
Hole.
In the cedar tree.
This portal.
This living portal.
This new portal.
I am affine.
To it.
To this scent.
And indeed this tree.
I may return one more time to that tunnel.
I am affine.
To it.
To this scent.
And indeed this tree.
I am affine.
To it.
To this scent.
And indeed this tree.
peace.
I may return one more time to that tunnel.
In case by some strange quirk of fate the man is there singing.
And I could introduce myself.
and understand where he studies and what he studies and with whom he sings and for whom he sings.
Measurement, authorization, perspective, intention, motivation.
Beauty.
