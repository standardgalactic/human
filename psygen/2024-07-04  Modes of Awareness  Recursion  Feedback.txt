Hello, everybody. Welcome.
I had a dream.
I've had many dreams.
Even some visions, occasionally.
I know the difference.
Which, I can't say that I'm a visionary.
But I've had a couple of visions.
And I definitely know the difference between that and a dream.
A vision, for me, anyway, my experience of them,
they happen during a very specific time
in which my mind was in an unusual array of ways.
And both times, it was in the daytime.
And suddenly, out of nowhere, I had to lie down.
And the moment I lay down,
in a kind of dreaming experience
that's unusually, what?
Local.
Very local.
Feels like it's right here.
And then I see, I see
features of the people who are coming to my home.
In one case, a doctor.
I should have understood those symbols.
In one case, a doctor who I'd never seen before.
And in another case, a helper.
In both cases, I saw, effectively,
specific features of their situation in life
that I could not have otherwise possibly have known
that were accurate.
I don't, I'm not saying this to take any credit.
This is not the kind of thing I could reproduce at will.
It's not like I have a skill, necessarily,
or I have a gift.
It's more like,
under conditions,
under unusual conditions,
where the stakes are very high
and consciousness is still somewhat coherent.
Right?
So it's like a high-stress situation, perhaps.
Other forms of sensing
arise
in our direct experience.
And yes, of course,
it's a problem.
Why is it a problem?
Because most of the time,
we're in an ordinary mode of mind.
which, let's be really clear,
is mostly shut down.
Right?
If you have 70 senses,
in your ordinary mode of mind,
you've got four.
Maybe six.
In your ordinary mode of mind,
you'll see from one perspective,
one array of values,
one or maybe two purposes at most.
In a non-ordinary situation,
it's almost the opposite.
You'll see,
for seven reasons,
from five perspectives,
19 purposes,
you don't have to know what each one is,
either.
You just naturally have an increased dimensionality.
And how is that increased dimensionality expressed?
It's expressed symbolically.
Right?
So,
the,
the doctor
was depicted as a short man
with a cast on his left forearm,
a shaggy dog
behind a curtain
in a small room.
The doctor was,
turned out to be unusually short.
Maybe,
hmm,
four, eight, four, nine.
He did not have a cast on his left arm,
but at home,
it turned out,
he had,
in fact,
a shaggy dog
that was often in his office,
which is a small room
behind a curtain
in his home.
Now,
of course,
you're listening to this
in the future of my experience,
and there's no,
I can't provide evidence
that what I
experienced in my visionary
trance
is what I am saying it is.
This is my honest recollection
about that event.
There were a couple of other features,
and because it's so long ago,
I can't remember.
It was a very similar situation
with the helper
in which I accurately described
her partner
and knew symbolically
some things about him
that were definitely pertinent
to the degree that she laughed
and thought,
like,
that's hilarious.
How could anyone know this?
Because she understood
the symbols as well.
One of them was
a very shiny bowler hat.
But I cannot recall
why she thought
that was perfect
and important
so long time ago.
So,
you know,
we have a reasonable concern
about what we call delusions.
And we have a reasonable concern
about insanity.
The way we make sense
of our own identity
and its relationship
to the world
is actually a fairly delicate
arrangement
of inhibitions.
And this delicate arrangement
of inhibitions
gets forged
half intentionally,
you know,
half accidentally.
Of course,
you know,
it's not a 50-50 thing,
but partly,
yeah,
partly intentionally,
partly accidentally.
Partly for coping,
partly for play,
partly for compliance,
partly to
fulfill various narratives
or expectations.
Yeah,
this interface
of self and world
and self to self,
self to world,
and world to self.
This interface
is very complicated.
We have a thing
called a private,
we could call
a private face,
which is
what we see
to ourselves
if we really look
carefully,
openly.
And then we have
various layers
of other faces.
closest companions,
you know,
closest companions,
parents,
more distant companions,
but close,
and so forth,
on out to strangers
and then on out
to possible strangers
and out from there
to the world itself
or some nation
or some cohort
or religion,
a political party,
some faction
of humans
that share
who knows
what strange
biases,
imperatives,
predilections,
insanities,
fictions,
beliefs,
faiths,
sciences,
who knows,
right?
But you can see
how complex it is
because,
for example,
if we're
at all interested
in science,
then we have a face
that faces science
inside us,
right?
Where we see
ourselves
from a scientific face.
If we have a face
that knows a little bit
about medicine,
then that face
faces us inwardly.
We decide,
like,
am I sick?
Do I have a fever?
Right?
We're using a very special
aspect of consciousness
when we do this
and we're collapsing
the entire range
of consciousness
into one of its
possible modes,
right?
The mode of
doctor,
am I sick?
Which we have
modeled.
How have we
modeled this?
By seeing
doctors
portrayed,
perhaps by being
cared for
by them,
by being
cared for
by parents
or other elders,
possibly by being
cared for
by siblings,
possibly by caring
for siblings,
friends,
elders,
in situations
where there's
trouble,
right?
So,
you know,
when people are
saying,
like,
hmm,
I wonder what
consciousness is,
I wonder if
they're fucking
thinking about
consciousness.
What are they
thinking about?
They're not
thinking about
consciousness
because that
stuff is so
complex.
It's the thing
they're asking
the question with,
right?
So,
if we have a
science-facing self
and a medicine-facing
self and a
psychology-facing
self and a
myth-facing
self,
all these
inside us,
right?
And never mind
what we face
outside and
what we can
at least
imagine as
cohorts that
might observe
and evaluate
us.
They might
ignore us.
They might,
yeah,
this is the
stuff.
That is the
stuff that
stung me
when I was
little.
I wonder
if it's
a nettle
huh,
just touched
this plant
and it
stung me.
I wonder
what that
is.
So,
think about
how sophisticated
your persona
is.
It's ordinarily
in a superposition
of states,
we might say,
transferring a
metaphor from
quantum mechanics,
right?
It's not this or
that.
It's not you
or not you,
right?
It's in a
superposition
of states.
And then
something
acquires your
attention and
it begins to
collapse to
say,
towards say,
you know,
two or three
of them at
the same
time.
Comedian,
athlete,
you know,
physical,
keep walking,
right?
Race car
driver,
avoid that
wreck.
naturalist,
what's that
plant,
animal,
bird,
insect,
et cetera.
That stung
me good.
See,
it's really,
okay,
now look at
what just
happened,
all right?
I started
talking about
playing the
doctor.
And what's
the next thing
that happened?
I got stung
by a plant.
And that's
actually what
took place.
So I'm
sitting here,
part of my
finger is
stinging.
It's a
little bit
blotchier than
it probably
should be.
It doesn't
look like a
rash yet.
And I'm
collapsing
my faculties
toward
checking the
severity of
the situation,
right?
I'm evaluating
how, okay,
is this,
you know,
how severe
is this?
Does it need
attention?
Am I okay?
Is it going
to bubble
up into
little pustules
like when I
was a kid
and was
playing in
this stuff
one day
with my
friend Mark?
But anyway,
my point
is,
within us,
to some
degree,
to a unique
degree,
and to
different
degrees in
different
situations
and times
of our
lives,
we become,
we collapse
the manifold
of our
identity,
intelligence,
awareness,
consciousness,
emotion,
sensation,
and then
as it
collapses
and becomes
highly
structured
and specialized,
an action
ensues,
right?
I lift
my finger
and carefully
examine the
place where
it stings,
for example,
or I
formulate this
sentence that
I am speaking
right now.
Do you see
how pervasive
this little
toy is?
So we're
doing this
all the time,
but we don't
think that way.
We think,
well, I know
who Darren
is.
He's a
coherent
array of
habits that
I'm well
familiar with.
In fact,
to be
entirely honest,
no one,
with the
possible exception
of divine
beings or so
forth,
no one is
as familiar
with Darren
as I am.
I am the
one who
experiences
Darren and
also enacts
him.
So I would
think I know
everything that's
going on,
but I don't
because I
think I'm
one guy,
and there's
nothing like
that going
on.
You know,
if you
painted a
label on
a blurry
waterfall
of states,
right?
You just
paint a,
you know,
you sculpt
some word
in steel,
cold.
You put it
behind the
waterfall.
Okay.
The waterfall
may indeed
be cool.
It might
even be
cold.
But that
doesn't help
anyone.
And that's
kind of what
we do.
We think,
you know,
I am a
me.
It's not
untrue,
and it's
most of our
experience.
but what
happens
when
enough of
the me
disappears
that the
more than
merely me
can arise,
signal,
dance,
express itself,
see,
know,
feel,
show,
right?
What happens
then?
The more
than merely
me.
Well,
here's a
couple things
that happen.
Art,
medicine,
science,
heroism,
war,
sports,
music,
dance,
you know,
speech,
sex,
rescue,
all kinds
of things
happen.
from the
more than
merely
me.
And so
normally,
you know,
we like
our normalcy
because it's,
it feels safe
and predictable
and comfortable.
We think,
oh,
I know
what's going
on,
quote,
unquote.
Good luck
with that.
That's a
convenient
fiction.
If anything
serious
happened,
whether it
was seriously
beautiful,
seriously
puzzling,
or seriously
violent,
you would
quickly realize
that the
mind with
which you're
comfortable
is almost
useless
and more
like a
prison.
than a
sanctuary.
Because
sanctuary,
and yeah,
I'm thinking
about Logan's
run right
here,
straight up.
Sanctuary
exists,
but it's
not a
place.
It's a
way of
being
human,
facing
ourselves
with others
facing us,
facing others,
facing the
world with the
world facing us,
facing the
sky with the
sky facing us.
It's a way
of
authentically
opening the
valves,
so to speak,
on the
puzzle box
space in
which our
awareness,
consciousness,
identity,
expectations,
emotions,
sensations,
are usually
trapped.
And that
box necessarily
represents,
I don't know,
like fucking
two hundredths of
our nature and
natural ability,
our needs,
our senses,
our faculties,
our ways of
seeing and
knowing and
learning,
growing,
playing,
healing,
remembering.
That last one
might be the
most important.
I had a
dream that I
was in a
prison where
my friend,
a friend of
mine is in
prison.
And then I
woke up and
it seemed
like,
ah, well,
you know, it
wasn't too
tough in the
prison situation.
Things were
okay in there
actually.
It wasn't a
lot of danger,
bad people,
or anything
like that.
It was just
very constrained.
A couple
times in the
dream I got
a little bit
nervous.
And then I
woke up and
thought, oh,
I'm not in a
prison.
That's nice.
I didn't
actually think
that.
I just
thought, hmm,
I can
remember the
dream.
Actually, that's
what I actually
thought.
I was excited
because I
could remember
features of
the dream.
And then
I listened
to a
podcast.
Well, various
things happened,
but I ended
up walking
around listening
to a podcast
called Third
Eye Drops.
And it was
something like
the ancients
knew how to
escape the
simulation.
Now,
I want
to kind
of blur
that word
simulation
because it
conjures
computational
contexts
and
structures.
I want to
blur that
word.
What do I
want to
call it?
It's not
actually a
simulation.
It's a
well, I
don't know
what it
is, first
of all.
But my
experience of
it resembles
a complex
array of
obfuscating
lenses that
when reality
shines through
them, lead
to lesser
stases or
hypostases.
things that
don't present
things that
are merely
illusory.
They're not
merely
illusory.
Nor are
they necessarily
a simulation
like a
machine would
make.
Even if they
were, they'd
have to be
simulations of
something.
Of something.
simulation is
the wrong
word.
We need a
much better
word.
Hypostasis
isn't bad.
How can
we illustrate
what a
hypostasis is?
It's an
actual metaphor.
Come on,
universe.
Universe.
non-internet.
There's a
mountain in
the world,
and there's a
representation of
the mountain on
the map, and
then there's
the representation
of the
intersection
between the
mountain on
the map and
the mountain
in our mind,
right?
So,
actually, the
last one is
the intersection
is between the
mountain in the
world, the
mountain on
the map, and
the mountain
in our mind.
That's a
specific
intersection.
So, the mountain on the map is a hypostasis.
The mountain in the mind is a very strange thing indeed.
And it's not merely a hypostasis.
It makes use of both features.
The hypostasis, which is probably the universe.
I mean, the hypostasis looks crazy. It's a tunnel.
It's got, like, origin, universe, galaxies, solar systems, this solar system, this star, this Earth, this moon,
then, you know, planetary topology local to Earth,
then the actual planetary topologies of Earth at this moment and whatever in a timeline.
I mean, yeah, the hypostasis is very complex.
The problem is, it's almost always useful to have new dimensions in which one can see, sense, know, learn, test, play, reflect, understand,
understand,
metaphorize, to metaphorize.
It's always, it's often good to have more dimensions, but you need coherent,
we need coherent introduction of dimensions, which is something dreaming usually does to some degree.
And some forms of cognitive or intellectual or philosophical pursuit are similar.
The podcast I was listening to on Third Eye Drops was revealing some unusually discussed information about Plato's allegory of the cave in, I think, the Republic.
And the host had some interesting stuff to share.
But what the host was saying, which is something most people who know about the cave allegory are at least familiar with,
is that we're trapped in a kind of a reduced dimensionality sensorium.
And the dimensionality isn't, it's not an inescapable situation, the problem is that compared to what we're used to seeing,
what's actually going on is terrifyingly profound, beautiful, momentous, and so forth.
So we tend to stay tethered up in the packaged goods version of existence.
And no one would say they would want that.
I wouldn't say I want that.
By the way, my finger is fine.
I've got a doctor coming back online for a moment.
I'm just checking in on my finger that got stung.
Consciousness collapsing to one of its modes.
Well, what if we could collapse consciousness into three to five modes at the same time instead of one?
That's what children do.
That's what brilliant humans do.
That's probably what gods do.
Pretty sure if there are aliens, they're doing it.
Spirit beings, yeah, they're up to that for sure.
Trees, probably doing that.
Fish, bet they're doing it.
You know, the sky, pure doing of that.
The sky is like, yeah, I'm stars and galaxies and black holes and quasars.
Nebula, star birth nurseries, neutron stars, Jupiter's.
So there's like, yeah, not like one thing.
I mean, it's obviously time space is a meta position, superposition over the whole category of identities we have around here.
And the problem is really that you don't want.
Okay.
Once you start being presented with symbolic information, unless you have a coherent sort of what?
I guess I'm going to call it, I'm going to be kind of clinical.
Unless your observation body is coherent, you're going to go nuts.
And the symbols themselves are not always coherent.
You know, like the whole situation, you're talking about an interface between, I don't know, a whole bunch of stuff.
The history of life on Earth, minds, the between of the self and the world and the universe and the sky and so forth, that between.
And where these two things overlap, and let's face it, they're the same thing.
So if they're overlapping, what's happening?
They're folding back on each other, right?
So if your consciousness is focused out into the world, what it's doing is it's focused, it's folding back onto its own origin.
Can you see that?
When you're doing the naturalist thing and you're watching the dolphins or whatever, you're folding back your awareness right onto your own origin.
And this produces feedback in awareness, like bubbling waves, right?
Like a sort of a place where a wave meets a wave kind of thing.
So you see the flowers and you think, oh, it's beautiful, right?
It's a recursion.
You're seeing, I mean, you're seeing like nine different things at least, probably a billion or endless numbers, infinite things.
But light is the reason you're able to see it all.
So you're seeing light, right?
And you're also seeing with light.
So you are the light, seeing the light, seeing the flowers.
The flowers, the flowers are, you know, sensing the light reflecting off you.
They don't have to have eyes.
They have, you know, cellular hyper structure.
So do the trees.
The flowers are probably fast.
The trees are a little slower.
Everything senses everything in light and, you know, electromagnetism and so forth.
You know, some materials, materialists will argue, well, though, the effects of the sensing are so tiny.
I know, but the problem is that when things get really tiny, they get really weird.
So let's, you know, keep both things in mind and not just say like, well, the effects are, you know, vanishingly small.
You know, vanishingly small turns out to be, whoops, superpositions.
You know, whoops, black holes or whatever.
Anyway, so you have this problem of not going nuts or of going nuts and then trying to sort of tune the three or four different dials you need to tune to produce coherent feedback, right?
From that recursive interaction at the, at the membrane of the interface, at the boundary of the interface and whatever you think of as the interface, right?
Whether it's your physical vision or the surface of your skin or the energy, the electromagnetic boundaries put out by the fields your body produces as a complex cellular hyper structure.
However, minute those fields might seem to our measuring machines.
So guess what?
There's a feature of consciousness like the doctor or the philosopher, which isn't merely the psychologist, though the psychologist is probably involved if we're doing this well.
Perhaps the counselor and the therapist and the priest and the seer woman and the saint and the witch and so forth, they are, they are in us and they can face ourselves from within us, right?
They are in us, all those things, because it's not just what you've seen portrayed in your life, though that may have colored what's in you.
It's what you brought to human birth in the lineage of, you know, your particular 873,421 ancestors or, you know, and nurture, right?
What you grew, the context you grew up in and nature herself, the library that's beyond your ancestors that you draw your being from, this world and so forth.
This world would produce all of the different modes of awareness that we humans are, you know, know of and speak of in our catalog of, you know, madman, author, philosopher, child, father, mother, grandmother, grandfather, hunter, warrior, athlete, dramatist, poet, actress, singer, musician, magician, wizard, witch, shaman.
Scientist, naturalist, psychologist, mathematician, engineer, all of these things, the world naturally produces all these things.
So all these things, they are, the world is more than them.
The world is the hyperstasis of these modes, right?
The world is the hyperstasis of these modes, right?
And all these modes are in us.
Few of us will experience the broad array of them.
And we'll probably, many of us at least, we will have a experience of some we don't like.
The patient, you know, the injured one, the victim, the target, scapegoat.
The rejected one, the criminal, the bad person, the outcast, the insane person, the broken person.
All these things.
All these things.
We will have, we will have some experience of that array.
And it will change in different times in our lives.
Hopefully, we don't just get stuck in one or two, especially if they're very dark.
So, it's funny.
The people next to me are talking about a very similar topic.
The dog is simultaneously trying to get at the geese and sneezing, which is its body trying
to interrupt it being triggered by the geese.
It's having two conflicting, two very strong conflicting triggers at the same time.
One, sort of more, a little more psycho-emotional, but very physical.
Eat the goose.
Chase the goose.
Get the goose.
And the other one, don't kill the animal.
Don't run away from the human.
Don't become, you know, you don't need to kill the animal.
Or something.
Who knows what's in there?
I mean, but it's making it sneeze, right?
And dogs often sneeze to interrupt triggers.
Or so I've heard.
So, of all the kinds of modes that we can have inside us, there's one that oversees the coherence
of the entire system.
And that one's job is to determine if we've gone batshit crazy or if we're having actual
a trustworthy non-ordinary experience.
Because most forms of crazy resemble or feel like non-ordinary experience.
And it's hard not to trust them because it's our experience.
So, we use the thing we see with.
We see because of the thing we see with.
The thing we see with casts a sort of a light on our experience.
And that light is interpretive.
And when it's coherent, non-ordinary sensing, very natural to human beings.
When it's incoherent, or there's a lot of stress, or there's a lot of pain, or there's
an overarching narrative, or one is being negatively evaluated by others, which is a stress, of course.
Then the coherence breaks down.
There's all kinds of things that can break the coherence down.
Sometimes the coherence never forms.
And sometimes we can sort of adjust the dials, right?
Like, imagine you have something a bit like an equalizer on a stereo or piece of musical gear,
or recording device, right?
You've got an equalizer with say, who knows what, twelve bands or something.
We could say six for ease.
Most of them have three, right?
Treble, mid, and bass.
So you could equalize the forces of flow in awareness, in the mind, in the inner eye with
which you interpret, with which you are both facing yourself and facing the world, and with
which the world is facing you.
You know, it's not an accident that one of the most commonly produced images...
Well, that's not true.
A very commonly produced image and a trope of schizophrenia, which is probably an outdated term
term at this point and far too broad to effectively discuss states of awareness.
Simply a single eye looking, right?
A single eye, a picture of a single eye.
They draw this commonly.
And all of us do.
I mean, many of us have.
I certainly have drawn, when I was little, just a single eye, you know,
in the middle of a pyramid or triangle or whatever, right?
We even have some structure resembling that on our money, I think.
At least the one dollar bill, maybe.
But yeah, this is a thing to be observed from without, evaluatively observed, or observed
from without by a disembodied thing, right?
Like a machine, or a robot, or a camera, or Facebook, or Google, or Sears, whatever.
You know, whatever corporation is interested in getting inside your little identity structure,
and dragging some loyalty out of you.
Momentary or long term.
Hmm.
It really is as if we're in a sea of demons trying to get us to worship them.
And money is the, if one of the, you know, substitutes for worship.
Money is the worship commodity around here.
Anyway, my point is just that there's a feature of the mind that looks at consciousness's structure, features, activity, results,
and decides, am I okay, or not, right?
Am I still, um, in my, quote, right mind, unquote.
And now we've looped back, and we're going to start producing feedback against the first topic.
Which is, okay, when you look out at the world, it's a wave hitting a wave.
Right?
It's the world as a wave.
The world is waving.
It's making light, bodies, animals, humans, food, all these things, right?
And you are the world, and you're looking back at the world.
So where those two things intersect, there's going to be feedback.
That roiling wave phenomenon.
You're going to have the same thing happen if you look at consciousness with consciousness.
It's going to produce feedback.
Just like, um, an electric guitar is, you know, when you take the, the pickups and put them near the speaker,
it's going to start squealing unless, you know, there's mechanisms to stop it or whatever.
When humans who've long been separated first, uh, are reunited and they, and they have,
they hold each other in esteem and are happy.
You'll hear them laughing and raising their voices and the tone of their voices.
Feedback, right?
When they're departing just as those people were, same thing.
Bye!
Raise your voice.
Wave your hands.
It's feedback.
It's a wave.
Literally wave your hands.
I mean...
So, when you look at consciousness with consciousness, it's going to produce feedback.
Now you really have a problem because you're trying to determine,
you've got one aspect of consciousness, the sort of, um, overseer in a way.
Not in a bad sense.
The one who checks to see if you're okay, mainly.
So you've got this overseer dude or chick or whatever, um, looking at the flow of consciousness
and remarking on it, analyzing it, um, testing it, checking it.
Well, that's going to produce feedback right away.
You're going to have a lot of trouble with that.
Now, most of the time it works fairly well because its job isn't too tough.
With ordinary consciousness, it's not too hard to do a state check and come away with a green light.
Right?
But once you start having non-ordinary experiences of consciousness, unless you have practice and you know something about a strange way in which awareness and consciousness resemble a kind of a living water.
If you know something about that, you've got a better shot.
Um, if you don't, what will happen is the shapes in the waves in the shapes in the feedback will overwhelm you.
You will identify with them.
You'll take them seriously.
You'll take them literally.
You'll take them hyper-connectively or sync, you know, synchromistically.
And that's when you're going to get into trouble.
Now, there are kind of, uh,
There's a sort of a pareidolia, right?
Which is the inclination to see figures in flowing, changing shapes like the grain in wood or the bark on a tree or the, um,
color differentials in quartz, the inclusions in quartz.
Those things form the suggestions of shapes.
And when consciousness examines consciousness and produces feedback, it's like this, right?
It does this.
And, you know, that is, that, that interaction, if it decoheres just a little bit,
will slip toward paranoia or megalomania or both.
And some other, you know, um, mania, paranoia, megalomania, hyper-creativity.
How much did you get people when you bought it?
Uh, 360?
No, no, no.
Come on.
No.
400 for one.
There are many different modes of madness.
And there's a whole range of this kind of phenomenon in consciousness that isn't bad or malignant.
It won't get you killed.
It won't get you killed.
I've seen it in a number of people.
They're in, uh, a sort of, uh, what we might think of as a manic state.
Um, but there's, uh, there's authentic, something resembling authentic prophetic awareness.
And this is a huge problem because you can have both things going on.
You can have, um, the person is in the grip of a series of narratives and they're having authentic prophetic awareness at the same time.
They have escaped the prison outside the prison world of ordinary mind.
They're not merely batshit crazy and they're learning.
They're sort of like a bird on its first flight.
They're learning how to see with the seven other eyes of the self and the soul.
It doesn't have to be seven.
I'm just using that like nine, 13, whatever you like.
The many other eyes of the soul.
And, uh, normally what happens among the ordinary humans is the ordinary humans just shut them down.
Um, they don't know how to relate with that at all.
They have no protocols for that.
So they just shut them down.
This usually ends in hospitalization, um, drugging.
Um, self-harm, accident, all kinds of things.
So we want, most of us, we want some degree of non-ordinary, we want to get a little bit out of the prison and we don't want to go insane.
Well, if you're going to go to, right, if you're a person who's lived in the desert your entire life and you decide like, I really want to go swim in the ocean.
You don't just go jump, you know, from an airplane into the open sea.
You talk to, you learn about the ocean, you learn about the water, you learn about currents and how to solve various problems that will certainly arise when you encounter the actual ocean.
Um, that'll throw you around sink, you trap, you drown, you eat, you learn about these things, right?
And it's the same with consciousness.
Uh, over time, you will naturally, as long as you don't go completely nuts or burn your mind with either drugs or trauma or both.
Um, and those things can burn patterns into the flow that are not helpful, uh, and can be lethally terrible.
Um, you can sort of crack the membrane in such a way that the crack tends to persist over time.
Um, with drugs, with trauma, sometimes just with probably DNA, heredity, maybe nature and nurture toxins are also trauma.
Okay, I've heard you talk to your religion.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I forgot about this.
So, it's dangerous terrain and...
Um...
I'm just going to focus this and throw you on the side, you know?
And so if you are not, like, here, then you need...
I mean, I've been out for you so many times.
So, you know, it's not the kind of thing where you want to just go messing about with it.
And this is mostly what happens with young people and with older people.
Um, they mess about rather unskillfully, uh, using drugs and, um, adventurism and so forth.
Huge problem.
Um, dreaming is the near-at-hand doorway to probably everything you can hope for in terms of getting outside the prison.
It natural...
It's a natural deprisoning, uh, uh, process, right?
And it's a living process that happens to most of us with great regularity.
It's rich.
It, um...
It, um...
It de-collapses the mode of identity and consciousness.
Uh...
It's very profound.
And that is another self-facing aspect of awareness, right?
The dreaming aspect.
It doesn't face the world.
Well, maybe it does in a way.
Maybe it mirrors the world rather than facing it.
But it's self-facing inwardly.
It mirrors the world rather than facing it.
But it's self-facing inwardly.
It's self-facing inwardly.
It's very profound.
It's very profound.
It's very profound.
And that is another self-facing aspect of awareness, right?
The dreaming aspect.
It doesn't face the world.
Well, maybe it does in a way.
Maybe it mirrors the world rather than facing it.
But it's self-facing inwardly.
But we can achieve something not dissimilar in what we think of as ordinary consciousness
as well.
And to some degree, by talking of these matters, by considering them in consciousness, in our
awareness, we are already beginning to... to step just a little bit outside the prison
of ordinary thought without going all the way to madness, you see?
And then talking about some of the dangers that are... that we may encounter when we...
when we depart the extremely stultifying predictability, normalcy of our habitual state of mind.
...and we're playing the violin.
If we move from one of the specific modes of self-facing awareness, consciousness, intention,
purpose, one of the forms, even if I move away from the darren form just toward the human
or the organismal or the being or the planet or the sky or the tree, if I move away, then
the field becomes rich, very rich inside it.
With ways of seeing that aren't trapped like my mind often is.
It's when I am shrunk down to darren and I'm worried about my worries and identity seems
concrete, explicit, given by circumstances, structured, compelling, continuous.
Patrick McGowan's old TV series, highly experimental, called The Prisoner.
It's hilarious.
This old TV series is kind of about this problem.
It's the problem of folding consciousness or awareness back upon its origins.
And look, this is what physicists do.
This is what philosophers do.
This is what children do.
Mothers are doing this.
The sky is doing this.
The world is doing this.
This is the doing of all things.
They're doing this.
They're being this process.
Well, we can get trapped in a backwater, so to speak, of the labyrinth of feedback that
results from recursion in the between of consciousness and being.
And if we direct consciousness at itself, which is effectively what we usually mean when
we say the words meditation, is kind of what we mean.
We mean to become observant of kind of the surface of the water of the mind from above it, right?
And long observation of that will give us the skills, naturally, to not lose our way
if we should suddenly find ourselves outside the prison or if the prison should start to
dissolve, so to speak.
We won't panic.
We'll remember, ah, yes, this is just the dissolution of the walls.
It's always interesting.
It's very commonly like this.
These features are familiar from what I've experienced in just observing my own mind and how it transforms
from a modal thing to its potential state, state of potential, and even the potential
can half fade into origin.
And some will say, why are you saying half?
And I'll say, because I said half.
Yeah, so you have origin potential and just tiny little bubbles of structure on the surface
fade away.
Now, perhaps, no more symbols either, enlightenment, the living light in awareness of its own origin
and nature.
But to get there, you know, I've not got there.
I've walked in that direction some.
Although I've learned a little tiny bit about the water and the eddies and the currents and
the character of the situation.
We are born to see outside the prison.
We start from outside the prison and we walk into it and build it up on purpose as we are
instructed to do by our peers, parents, culture, history, language, thrisps of various kinds, isms.
And then, because we are so familiar with it, we get married to it, we get stuck in it.
The spider's web is supposed to extend its sensorium and world line.
If our minds were like this, they would, they do naturally, but our minds can become a trap
in that we get stuck on features of the web that we made and we confuse those features
with ourselves, our identity or our situation and so forth.
I am home.
I will rest.
Thank you for joining me.
I wish you a very beautiful way and day and dreams, seeing.
I look forward to learning together again sometime soon.
Bye-bye for now.
Bye-bye for now.
Bye-bye for now.
Bye-bye for now.
Bye-bye for now.
