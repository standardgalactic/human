hello everybody welcome especially want to thank those of you who are new to my
channel and giving me a little bit of attention I work pretty hard to produce
quality content I'm not here to blow my own horn or parade around like I'm
something special what I'm interested in is learning how to see better together
trying to understand what the actual potentials of our human nature are how
those were lost how we might recover them together so this is what you're
going to find me exploring and some of the older material you're gonna you're
gonna see like a radical difference in the depth and the level of inspiration
in some of my older material because back in the days when I was younger and the
experiences that forged my mind were more fresh there's some very profound stuff
back there you'll find a little bit of mania back there too but if you you
know if you don't find a little bit of mania you're probably looking in the
wrong place because our actual nature as human beings is so staggering that if
exposure to it doesn't light you up you're probably mostly dead inside or
you're just you know you've been turned into some kind of a conceptual and
sensorial zombie by the ceaseless impoverishments of our common anti-cultures
and ridiculous domineering paradigms so yeah I encourage you to do the
archaeology go back in time especially to the the historical epoch in my channel
where you'll see the same image looks sort of like a little satellite right and
there's some kind of a code word those are the early days and some of that stuff I
think you'll find very at least in at the very least entertaining if not
astonishing and inspiring so yeah I'm so glad to have some new subscribers I think
a lot of that is probably due to my some of it's due to interviews with Lee Gerard
Barlow I'm gonna be doing another interview with on this coming Wednesday
super excited about that and then also Alan Steinfeld and Henrietta Weeks who I
should be having another interview with on Monday or Tuesday of the coming week
um I'm working on getting some other interview subjects which I'll keep quiet for
the moment I also think you know some of the new people are here because of my
discussion of Amon Hillman who certainly a maniac but a rather interesting one I've got an essay
about him coming out shortly on my medium channel you can find me there if you just
look look for Darren Stevenson on medium I think my channel is called at organelle I've got that if I
remember that correctly so yeah please take a moment to ask a question like if you if
you do in fact like the content like it share it anything that helps me grow my
audience is very powerful and its ability to empower me to continue this work and
I'm profoundly thankful to to my mediums excuse me my patreon supporters I do have
a patreon you want to throw me a dollar every month that means a lot because if
there's a few of you that do that that adds up quickly so you know that's twelve dollars a year
I also have a a PayPal account you can make a direct donation if you care to I very rarely solicit
patronage but it's extremely helpful for me
even though you know what I actually earn from patronage is about these days around 140 dollars a
month pretty minimal and I pay out some patronage to others whose work is important to me
as well so yeah take a moment ask a question share an experience and insight share your thoughts
like or you know how dislike the video share it whatever you feel comfortable doing grateful that
you're all here and then I'm still vertical after all these years I can walk around and still physically
able-bodied and somewhat able-minded
I've been listening over the past couple days to
something I very rarely pay any attention to Joe Rogan
um but I was curious to see his interview with David Grush former top-level intelligence officer with the United States military whistleblower on the topic of UFOs I learned quite a bit
uh of you know I've been following Grush since approximately May of last year and I've written a long essay on the history of the UFO phenomenon
in the United States it's on my Medium channel there's actually a couple essays of related topic there I've been following UFOs since I was six or seven years old so you're talking
you know late 60s late 1960s long before this was a cult phenomenon though it always had a bit of the uh
uh perhaps both the stigma and the shining of the non-ordinary about it um yeah when I was a kid I read chariots of the gods by von Donakin fascinated by Egyptology read the Egyptian book of the dead when I was 11
um I was a voracious reader as a child and
uh I don't know if I'm if I still qualify because I'm not doing a lot of reading these days but
I have a huge library and an active bookshelf
um
so I've been fascinated by this since I was a child
uh I think the
the inspiration of my fascination is relatively simple
there must be actually intelligent other beings in the universe
and
those of you who know my work
know that I very commonly
argue
that there's actually intelligent other beings all around us
um
because their mode doesn't match ours
our species generally doesn't recognize them
and science is
only kind of starting
not that science is one thing
it's not
um
but
there are people within science who are well aware
that we are surrounded not merely by intelligences but by transcendence
this doesn't have language or models to talk about it yet
um
um
so
yeah I think
you know if what we mean by intelligence is
builds machines
then we're the only one
around here
uh
the only local one here
that seems to be doing this
apparently
we are apparently the only local one
um
that's a pretty dumb idea of intelligence because
without
the complex necessary social intelligence
the capacity to build machines
will get everything dead right quick
so
that doesn't look like intelligence to me
that looks like
uh
a specific mode of cognition
that's extremely dangerous
and not actually intelligent at all
any species that offloads their evolutionary momentum
into machine building
who's gonna snuff themselves and their environment in short order
so that just doesn't look intelligent to me
and I
I longed
to meet other beings
who were actually intelligent
um
partly because
I believed that the universe would produce such beings
and partly because
they might give us the keys to save our world
and
if not our worlds
our world
at least our minds
now I have a variety of topics on my mind
today
and I'm not sure which of them I'm gonna get to
I'm gonna start here
I'm gonna bookmark a couple things
so frame collapse
I'm gonna call frame collapse
and um
multiple worlds
but not
the uh
not the physics theory
so
I've been listening
to
Joe Rogan's interviews
um
over the past couple days
first with David Grush
who I think is a person of
high integrity
and
true patriotic
spirit
and what I mean by true patriotic spirit
is a very rare kind of thing
believes in the origins and purposes
that underlie
our
nation's formative
urgencies
and
is willing to risk
everything
to
preserve
protect
and
develop those
um
there are probably
far better urgencies
we're running a nation on an operating system written in the seventeen hundreds
um
we think we're intelligent
that's not intelligent
and in fact at the level of we
the level of our
collectives
our species is idiotic
um
catastrophically ignorant
um
easily
captured and mis-motivated
um
inclined to continue
with devastatingly
stupid orientations
activities agendas and so forth
so
there's very little intelligence about
the dominant
features
of human beings
in our time
human beings as a group
individual humans it's easy to find shining examples of brilliance
collectives
very uncommon
why is this so this is a question we should deeply preserve
pursue
and I suggest transform
actually the area we were had big boulders that have been sort of
down
hmm
so the Grush interview was quite interesting I learned a number of new things
I've probably heard six interviews with him maybe seven
um
you know people may say whatever they like about him
uh
personally I consider him a modern hero
he is certainly the
the flag bearer
the ring bearer
of
the movement for disclosure
in our time
disclosure being
the revelation
of what our government
quote unquote
I mean that's presuming it even belongs to us
which is
sort of a ridiculous
supposition
it's not our government
it's a government
it's the government that
is associated
with us
but has its entirely own
it should be very obvious
um
existence agendas
its motivations
and they are not ours
right
so
yeah I mean that
that should come as a revelation
the American government is not ours
it's not going to become ours
it's a separate entity
um
a dumpster fire of competing
highly aggressive
well defended thrisps
which are
dead inside processes
that capture groups of humans
and deploy them for the furtherance
of non-human agendas
by non-human agendas
I don't mean alien agendas
I mean
uh
agendas born
in the absence of our humanity
in the collective
active
behavioral cognition
of our species
right
three of the very lethal
uh
modes of this
are
commerce
war
um
and ideology
right
so
yeah this is not
our government
this is the government
associated with where we live
um
it was never really our government
it didn't
when we were born it wasn't ours
when we will die it won't be ours
it won't belong to our children
it didn't belong to our ancestors
you should understand this very clearly
the idea that we have a government
is insane
there's no chance of that being true
that's a lethal fiction that we operate under the aegis of
daily
to our grave detriment
but uh
Grush came forward and said
this government
here
has and has long had
direct knowledge of non-human intelligences
in time space
visiting earth
with objects
material objects
things that we would call technology
we have recovered
or
have been given
instances of these technologies
including things we would call vehicles
um
there are
a number
at least
ten
and possibly as many as thirty
vehicles
there are a broad array of objects
of a
semi
or meta-technological nature
that this government
is and has long been in possession of
there is intelligence about this matter
this government is in possession of
and there is no oversight
in other words you have a breakaway civilization
inside this government
that is no longer
merely human
they are no longer modern humans
they are not us
and what I mean by a breakaway civilization
is a civilization in possession of artifacts and or technologies
that are advanced so far beyond anything we can even conceive of
that they qualify as a different species
right
if you can imagine
a group of humans capable
with computers and capable of using them
during say the civil war era
this is what we are talking about
same physical species not the same technological species
and technological species
now
Grush isn't saying
there is a breakaway civilization
but let's be clear
these topics
are classified above
at levels above
weapons of mass destruction
nuclear power nuclear weapons and so forth
this is the most secret
of secret things
and the reason that it's the most secret of secret things
is fairly simple
it comprises the Holy Grail
of asymmetric advantage over any conceivable
terrestrial enemy
and strangely
ironically
lethally and devastatingly
at the group level
our species
is absolutely married
being married
to war commerce
prison earring
ideology
and self devastation
at the individual level
nothing like that is going on
at the collective level
the kind of animal that we are
is absolutely captivated
by what I call thrisps
which are essentially artifacts
artifacts
that form
in our group
in the dimension of human group cognition
when that dimension
of group identity
relation
memory
commitment orientation
purpose
is evacuated
and
when we depart from that
thrisps
are the result
you could imagine something like cancer
you could imagine something like cancer
you could imagine something like
the difference between
the untouched Amazon rainforest
and
dead cities
right
imagine cities that just
build themselves with robots
they're dead inside
there's nothing in there
it's a good analogy for thrisps right
so the
the dead cities
eat
the living rainforest
create
lethal
dead structure
whose primary purpose
is simply the production of further
dead structure
in this case rather than in the Amazon rainforest
it's in
the network of minds
comprised
by human beings
and
the other living networks
that we humans draw
our origin
purpose
spirit
and dreaming from
which would be all the living beings of earth
and in fact
beings far beyond the earth
beings who are not merely material
so Grush
you know was being persecuted
he was tasked with determining if such
black projects exist
exist
that are oriented to
hide
and reverse engineer
retrieve non-human technologies
he discovered there were in fact such black projects
and then
he started being persecuted
not surprisingly
and threatened
and so forth
so he went directly to the inspector general
of the intelligence community
the intelligence community
and
you know
dumped data
about this history
the history of this situation
mainly so that he could be
in some way protected
from reprisal
but also because
what's going on is illegal
right
it's
a violation of our
of the concept of the constitutional government
democracy
and so forth
because what you
what we apparently have here
or what exists here
whether we have it or not
is
a relatively modest group
of humans within
the US military
that are operating
without oversight
and are
essentially stealing funds
from other projects
and then hiding
that extortion
that extortion
so
you know
this has been going on now for
well
look
people been trying to
bring this to light
for probably more than 50 years
in our nation
in this nation
and mostly failing
and suffering
murder
threat
derision
the
obliteration of their
social
or personal
or occasional
identities
histories
potentials
and so forth
so Grosh
you know
in some ways
he's
he's Frodo
he's the ring bearer
he's the one
on whose shoulders
this is landed
and I really don't care
what anyone has to say
there's no way this guy was motivated
by self-interest
if he was motivated by self-interest
he would maintain his clearances
and continue to ascend
the essentially endless ladder
of privilege and pay
in the top branches of the United States military
the United States military
are you kidding me
right
like you know
someone thinks like
oh he's trying to make money
there's no money in this for him
he's trying to stay alive
trying to keep his family alive
and he's trying to reveal
in a way that can't be rolled back
a series of catastrophic
agendas
and situations
within the government of the United States
in the closed stacks
so to speak
of the libraries of our government
government
so
you know that was an interesting interview
I knew most of what
Grush spoke of there
and he's limited in what he can speak of
because he has to have
he has to have a thing called Dobster clearance
and he has to have
he has to completely
fail
to violate
that
so he can say what he
has been authorized
no he can say what he hasn't been forbidden
from saying
but if he veers much from that
they're going to come for him
and there's a lot of people hoping that he's going to do that
right
because they're just
they just want him to veer a tiny bit
from the way he crosses one of those T's
or dots one of those I's
in what he's sharing
and
they'll arrest him
or silence him
or revoke his clearances
or you know whatever
whatever steps can be taken at the official
logistical
and legal level
to get that
to get that guy off the playing board
he's a big thorn
in the side of many
the side of many
so then
today I was listening to
Rogan interviewing George Knapp
who's
you know been at this for
what is this
you know he's been a pro-disclosure
someone working for disclosure for like 36 years
long long time
and
also Jeremy Corbell
also Jeremy Corbell
who
is a little more recent
in his
commitment to the
to the mission
and again what's you know what's the mission
it's
there's a there's a it's layered right
layer one
tell human beings we're not alone
we know for a fact
that we're not alone
in the universe
there's no chance
of that being true
and we've known this for a long long time
there are other intelligences
it's not entirely clear that they're merely biological
the way we are
I am also aware that there are other
forms of intelligence
there are field intelligences that are probably the origin of our minds
without which we wouldn't have consciousness or anything like it
and
there seems to be
a ladder
of forms of intelligence
each of which contribute
something to both
the ladder
and the orders above and below them
so for example
around here
the
the plants and the microorganisms
are profoundly advanced
intelligences
physicalizations
platforms if you will
that contribute
up and down scale
to the possibility
of the existence
of
our minds
the minds of animals
we think
we think
who knows what we think
at the collective level
we're relatively stupid because we are
easily captured by
ideological
what?
inhibitions? nonsense?
so like reductionism and materialism
have dominated
our species
our species
at the collective level for a very long time
well, a long modern time
I don't know
a couple, three, four hundred years or something maybe
and those two ideologies are blinding
stupefying
and mechanizing
you can imagine
bless you
you can imagine
some sort of comic book scenario
right?
where like
a human
lives in a caged
off area
or in a box
and outside it
there are trillions of forms
and modes of other intelligences
but in its backyard
it only sees
you know a few examples
of other beings
that it can convince itself
aren't intelligent because they don't make machines
let me just be really clear about something
any cell in your body
outperforms
the entire history and future
of human forged machines
three billion times per second
there's nothing
there's no need for anything resembling machines
none
nature's billions of light years beyond anything resembling
the necessity of mechanization
all of the things we think we need machines for
we don't need machines for those things
and since we're developing only machines
we've lost access to the meta technologies that are implicit in nature
and these include the ability to travel anywhere instantaneously
to not merely touch other minds telepathically but forge networks of them
anything you can instantaneous healing
probably resurrection of the dead
anything you can possibly imagine
with the exception of war
or the need for commerce or prisons or anything like this
the actual situation that we're in
bears no resemblance
bears no resemblance
to our common suppositions and the ideologies that dominate
our
common layer
of thought
supposition expectation
cosmology
science
so forth
if you're alone
you're going to need machines
if you belong to the families
the time space is the standing wave body for
you will never need a machine
and so some people say well then why are there UFOs and so forth
yeah well
you might not need machines
it doesn't mean you'll never forge them
there's a difference though between
there's a difference though between
the difference between intelligences that forge machines and intelligences that are dominated by
them is that the latter are quickly snuffed
by their own
by the results of their own defection
from life
it's not a problem to forge the occasional machine
having a couple of automobiles isn't a big deal
having billions of them competing with the anciently preserved
ecologies of our world
that's a deadly deal
so there are
you know
throughout time space
biological and
parabiological
peoples
who
do
forge something
at least vaguely resembling machines
presuming that
the things that we have
the things in the possession of our government
are that kind of thing
right
or a machine
and you know probably part of the reason why we
why our government has been unable to
properly reverse engineer these things is that they're not merely machines
they involve principles
that we have no analog for
they are
you know
if they are piloted
they're not piloted
mechanically
most likely they're piloted by consciousness
so now you need
so in order for our government to do anything with these we need humans
humans
who have the capacity to touch objects with consciousness
and manipulate them that way
they don't have levers and wheels and things inside them
many of them are probably single objects
right have no parts
there's no parts
they might have features
but not parts
so today I was listening to Korbel and Knapp talk about
kind of the history and
a bit more in depth
from outside of Grush's experience
what's been going on with him
and that's been quite fascinating
I learned a lot from that conversation
this is some downstream
intelligence
you know from after the time when our
this government forged
some
some documentation
some documentation
and
what do you call this
some legal structure
around the topic
for fiscal
twenty twenty four
appropriation of military budgets
there's
legislature
legislation
that um
wow
there's some other intelligence right there
there's legislation
that orbits the disclosure
of these
situations
and that authorizes
congress and the house
to go after
uh
factions within
this government
and within the private commercial sector
that have been involved in this situation
it sort of gives them a sort of truth and reconciliation
I'm not talking about
the halo video game level
of course I kind of am
um
where uh
you know
come forward let us know
we'll relieve you of responsibility
don't let us know
we'll come for you
kind of thing
um
so that was gutted
my understanding is that the legislation was gutted to some degree
and there are particular people in the government
um
the gentleman whose
donors include
Raytheon
Lockheed, Boeing
etc
and whose
district includes
Wright-Patterson
Air Force Base
which is historically
um
infamous
in this
fiasco
um
can't recall their names at the moment
not too hard to find them
it's a couple of people that have shut down
the
the public hearings and so forth
couple of
what senators or congressmen
um
these guys are idiots
they are
they're people with
historical records of catastrophic misdeeds
um
they're shills
straight up shills
uh... so
that's been going on
since last year
there have been some hearings
at least
at least two
uh... one major one
where Grosh
David Fravor
and another
uh... you know ace pilot ace fighter pilot
and another pilot what
Ryan
Graves maybe
I'm not trying to remember all the names at the moment
um...
where these folks all testified
about this
this matter
um...
in
you know to the degree
that it
would become
futurally impossible
to make ridiculous claims
like there's nothing there
these are not cases
um... these are just crazy people
which you know this is what's been going on to hide the phenomena
on purpose
they lit up crazy people on purpose
and then pointed at them and laughed publicly
for the past fifty years
to
produce a smokescreen
about the topic
in the public eye
so the first layer
is to reveal to the public
that we're not alone
we're not the only game
in town
in time
in space
even around here
we're not
we never have been
um...
and
the second layer is that
this has long been being hidden
primarily because
it's like i said
the holy grail of asymmetric war advantage
or asymmetric commercial advantage
or asymmetric slavery
enslaving advantage
and at the group level
are completely disoriented species
captured by thrisps
highly motivated
in these three areas
enslave
imprison
slaughter
um... commit on the side
kill everything
you can
turn that into products
stack up representations
of that value in banks
concentrate
the value in
0.02%
of the living human population
for one lifetime
burn down the future
obliterate the historical past
lie
like there's no tomorrow
um...
rape the children
burn the mothers
you know just like
demons
straight up demons
right
so yeah these are the motivating forces
that are arrayed against us
and people are concerned about
which president wins
well of course there is some concern
there's good reasons for that concern
but
at this point
at this late point
you know
if
this is kind of a ridiculous analogy
but
if human civilization
if we metaphorically
analogize human civilization
as the construction
and preservation
of the
giant double penis
with no testicles
that used to dwell in New York
right
the twin towers
then
what's going on right now
is that
the charges have been detonated
inside
the structure of the building
the charges have been detonated
the things are falling
you know
the planes have crashed
the charges detonated
the things are falling
and we're arguing about
you know
who gets to stand on the top floor
while the thing collapses
it's
a catastrophic
disorientation
of
our human potential
and nature
history
and future
watching the
sickly
sewage
sewage rich froth
bubbling on the surface of
our present moment in human history
history
is terrifying
and demoralizing
for all of us
we are not
our families
our histories
our lineages
and
when I say those words
I mean
the living places
we arose
in and for
our families
include the sky
the moon
the sun
the mountain
the forest
the river
the desert
the ocean
the animals
the plants
the insects
all of the water creatures
these are our families
they are being put to the torch
in our lifetimes
for
the sake
of
disorientations
too absurd
to imagine
let alone pursue
and yet
this is where
quote
we
unquote are
and it seems
that we are
incapable
hi
that seeming is wrong
it's not true
it seems that we are incapable of forming
anything that could
we don't need to fight against what's happening
that's that's one misconception
any kind of war is going to lead to more war
the planet and we are too delicate at this point for war
uh
so this is one of the other layers right
the layers
the third layer is the lie
that there's a government that represents us
it doesn't
never did
let me be really clear
we have been alive for x number of years
the government is older than us
it's a structured
array of lethal fictions we inherit at birth
it's bullshit
it's deadly
the fact that you have the better version of cancer
than the other people on the planet
that will not fucking help you
ever
if we're to have anything resembling our humanity
we have to forge something worth living in and for together
and
this will not be a set of structured agreements
it will be a set of relational prodigies
ways of playing at being human together
that are so beautiful
restorative
medicinal
developmentally profound and amazing
that no one's willing to be left out
that
direction
is open
is open
that door is open
everything in the history and future of life on this world
wants
the humans to become uncaptured
so there are ways
of starting on a small scale
three to five people
that quickly become extremely
effective and profound and contagious and don't involve war
that's where hope
that's one of the directions in which hope is alive for this planet
that's where hope
that's one of the directions in which hope is alive for this planet
alright so
let's see here
by the way that
that little vocal move that I made there
was
that's
that's my father's voice
that's not mine
that's my dad
my dad's voice
that was one of his
vocal idiosyncrasies
I just recognized it
playing in me
you know we think we are individuals
it's insane
what I am is
is like
imagine a billion thread lines
of history and relation
from every part of nature in the sky
and these billion thread lines have a kind of a
a bubbling forefront
a wave front
in time space
that's what I am
I'm not Darren
I'm not merely human
that's what we are
and if we don't have access to that because of some fiction
where I think I'm Darren or Darren's important or any of that kind of thing
it's not that I'm not
it's that
letting the aspect of me that thinks that's important drive the car is insane
because there's
you know
nine billion forms of intelligence supporting me
that if I would just let them synthesize and symphonize together
if I would just let them orchestrate
there's no chance logic can outperform that
there's no chance rationality
conceptual thought
even
what we think of as mathematics
there's no chance
of those useful artifacts outperforming their origins
if their origins are free
to fuse and synergize
and see and learn and grow
and
anamnese
together
to un-forget
together
you know there is something weird going on here
on earth
which I don't think is universal
which is a kind of a forgetting
metaphorized in the Greek myth of the river left
in which we are dipped between lives
so that we forget all that came before
an anamnese is the reversal of that tragedy
in us
you know some portion of the question
surrounding the existence of what we think of as UFOs and alien life
probably a good portion of that question
has to do with our own origin as a species
because let's be really clear
I'm
I'm not an expert
but
listening to many experts
the chances that we evolved here on earth
by mere mechanical accident
as reductionist materialism supposes
in my view
chance of that
.00000000001
or less
and you know roll the dice
how many times you have to roll the dice to come up with that
right well trillions and trillions and trillions of times
and finally you get that result
so
yeah there is no chance that we just evolve mechanically
do do humans look like a natural result of evolutionary processes on earth to you?
is that what we look like to you?
because look around
there is precisely one representational cognitive on this planet
one
there is exactly one animal
which is supposed to be amazing
capable of completely defecting from all relationships into mechanism
into commodity into war
into attacking the reflection of its absence in the mirror of biorelational progeny
that's a weird fucking accident
something went horribly sideways for that to occur
I have precisely zero
suspicion
that humans evolved
without
without being
without the direct intervention
influence or engineering
of other intelligences
and indeed
you know
our religions directly or indirectly
and as insane as many of them are
and I don't mean insane in the good way
I mean insane in the broken way
most of them
if they don't directly say that this is what has taken place
they imply
something similar
something similar
that we were
intentionally
engineered
we were made
and there appear to be a number of stories that's very specifically
at least if we listen to
to
maniacs
half brilliant maniacs like Randall Carlson
but specifically
detail
something that sounds an awful lot like
the careful genetic evolution
genetic engineering of our species
in what
Sumerian
tablets
which I guess there are
many thousands
now
I'm not using those as evidence
I think you can just look at the situation
right
here on earth
look around at the rest of nature and look at us
do we look like the same thing
because we don't to me
I mean when I see automobiles
I'm seeing something that doesn't belong in nature
at all
and you know there are people who will say well you know
nature is really weird like anything
you know it's the encompassing super container
so anything that appears in nature is natural
yes from one perspective that's absolutely true
from a conceptual perspective nature is the super container for all that is
so it's the same thing as saying everything
so you can't then from that perspective there's nothing that's unnatural
but from the perspective of biorelational intelligence
there's nothing that I can understand about nature that on a living planet would produce
omnicidal maniacs like modern homo sapiens
machines
and this is a question I've chased for a long time
okay so
are
you know
is what
we have this word
the word is artificial
and what we mean by that usually
we can mean different things with it
depending on who's talking and where
words don't have meanings we use them to mean things to each other
but what is generally meant is
human engineered
and
this word
we use
to divide
to distinguish
between
what a world without humans would naturally produce
and what humans as we know ourselves produce
artificial
so
it looks to me like our species is a strange example of defection
from nature that I want to highlight and emphasize and pay very careful attention to
because the history and future of life on earth may very well depend on making this specific distinction
right
our ability to make this distinction intelligently
with awareness
understanding
insight
recognition
of the face of origin face of living beings
and the difference between that face
and the face of our species at the group level
because that's a staggering difference
it's the difference
between
sunrise
and the detonation
of a nuclear weapon
if you can't see that difference
my God
what can you see
you are blind
you are blind in a way that will just generate further blindnesses
in order to justify the blindnesses that have gone
you know
unopposed thus far
that sound
is the opposite
of
omnicidal fury
that's the sound
not of speech
but of anciently originating
and conserved
intelligence
transcendence
origin
so beautiful
so true
so true
absolutely authentic
that's a signal whose content you can absolutely trust
and whose content may be so profound
who knows what's in there
right
who knows what's in that signal
that's a signal towards transcendence
that's a signal towards
the resurrection of the possibilities of intelligence
there's no
defection
there's no
defection
there's no deception
there's no agenda
ma'am i think you dropped one of your bags back there
oh thank you
certainly
you see
you see when i began to speak with the older woman
in the beginning of my speech she had to go through a series of phases
communication phases
where she evaluated
signal
for
a variety of features
right
is the signal deceptive
is the signal predatory
is the signal opportunistic
and as i was speaking she was doing these evaluations
i could see her doing them
she did not meet my eyes
this is what is known as signal intelligence
and it's fundamental to having minds
that
have boundaries
right
it's fundamental to us and them ism
so she had to go through a cascade of evaluations
and after the first ones i mentioned
then came things like is the signal useful
is it intelligent
is it
operationally
coherent
does it matter
is it important
is it significant
right sign-ificent
all these things
now
this is what's going on every time we speak
or encounter information
we're doing the same cascade
the problem is that
the orienting
gatekeeping intelligences or features
what i would call sentinels in consciousness
can be captured
they can be overwhelmed
and social media is made
of the tactics that overwhelm these sentinels
so is commercial media
even private media has to compete
right so people like bankski
employ coding strategies
that produce the desire to replicate the signal
the signal
or
ok
nap in the interview with rogan
Knapp, in the interview with Rogan.
Actually, I'm going to go back to Grush.
Grush was talking about his specialization in forms of intelligence
and technological, weaponized technology that fall under the aegis of cyber war.
And what he was saying was that part of the current landscape
or the landscape when this was current for him
was something we could call attribution obfuscation.
So an event occurs, let's say you obliterate the power grid of a nation.
That's a tactically effective military advantage.
And, but another part of the, if your goal is to fuck people up or kill them
or obliterate the coherence of their, you know, structured relationships,
then there's other layers, right?
Like you can obfuscate who did it or you can plant evidence
that makes it look like it came from so-and-so
when actually it came from thus-and-such.
And you can also, there's all kinds of sort of signal intelligence aspects of war.
And, I mean, you can, one can easily cause an enemy to obliterate themselves for you
with the right kinds of obfuscation technology and attribution error.
I'm not going to detail a variety of scenarios to you,
but imagine that the United States, you know,
thinks that Russia has launched nukes at it.
In fact, there are no nukes flying.
The U.S. responds as though nukes are flying and ends up gone.
Yeah.
I mean, that's a really crudely modeled toy of a situation
where you take down large portions of the United States.
Yeah, let's, let's look at a better one.
Let's say you can take down immediately large portions of the United States energy grid
and then attribute it to a foreign actor that had no involvement.
You can take out both enemies at the same time, right?
The United States will take out, try to take out their perceived enemy.
Meanwhile, that perceived enemy had no knowledge
or functional relationship to the event and so forth.
So these are SIGINT, the weaponization of SIGINT
and identity in conflict, right?
Weaponizing identity in conflict.
So we've come a long way here.
I think what Gresh was talking about in his concerns about cyber war
was that the United States is developing technologies
that are uncontrollably powerful,
particularly with the advent of what we call,
what we're referring to as artificial intelligence.
And so are other nations.
And that's going to lead to a race to the bottom
of weaponized computational technologies.
Rogan seems to think we're a,
we are a meat caterpillar
engineered to produce a mechanical butterfly.
I've got to say, like Rogan's cosmological speculations
are among the least interesting things
I've ever had the misfortune of listening to,
even if they are relatively sophisticated
just because of his position, right?
His position is integrative, right?
He's standing over a vast array
of intelligent and amazing and insightful human beings.
He's the linchpin that links all those together.
So that's a highly privileged position.
And actually an intelligent person
would go for a position like that
very intentionally.
Not entirely dissimilar to Alan Steinfeld's position
in the UFO, paranormal, non-ordinary,
near-death community,
you know, shamanism and so forth communities.
That's the sign of a very advanced intelligence
to get into the between of all those minds.
So before I'm about to come to a place
where there's a lot more noise, unfortunately,
but I'm going to talk briefly about
the ideas that were in my mind
when I first began this recording.
So many of you have heard the term synchronicity
and it's hard to know exactly what this means.
Once again, we use terms to mean things to each other
rather than them just having a meaning
as we might otherwise suppose.
Outside of a meaningful conversation,
terms don't have much of a meaning.
They just have denotations.
Right?
But synchronicity is commonly taken to mean
something resembling
a meaningful
or benevolent
or
dangerous
array,
a cascade
of what we would think of as coincidences.
The other afternoon
I was in my basement
and
I was thinking about a text
I had sent three days ago
to a friend
in which it was clear
we had
the
tempo of the communication
had been broken, right?
So we were texting back and forth
every few minutes
and then
I texted him
and nothing came back.
So two or three days later
I was in my basement
and I was taking out the garbage
and I thought
for a moment
I brought to mind
the sequence of that conversation
when I went back up the stairs
and looked at my phone
he had responded.
And that's not a mere coincidence
that's
what I would call
an incidence
of
you know
communicative telepathy
which I've had enough
experiences of
to know
what that feels like
what it looks like
and the difference between that
like one of my
one of my frenemies
likes to say
yeah
you just think it's telepathy
because you're not counting
the times it failed.
Well here's the number of times
it failed.
Never.
Because the thing that he's calling
a failure
doesn't look the same
or feel the same
as the thing that actually succeeds.
But yeah
imagine that you're
driving through a city
and every time you come
too light
it's green
for like half an hour.
There's an example.
Now it's possible
that you just happen
to be in the right place
at the right time
but not over 50
you know stoplights.
Not likely.
So synchronicity
usually is used to mean
a sequence of
non-ordinary coincidences
and often there is
something like this
that happens
around
the
event horizon
of a non-ordinary
the emergence
of non-ordinary
awareness
intelligence
or experience
in a human
or a small group
of them
sometimes a large group
mostly a small group
though
and there's a related
phenomenon
that we don't usually
talk about
and someone said
for example
to me
this morning
that
my posts
on Facebook
had often
they felt
had often
had a peculiar
resonance
with what was
going on
in their life
around the time
that they found
that they encountered
these posts
and this brought
to mind
something I discovered
fairly recently
I was probably
aware of the
principle before
I didn't have
any reasonable
way to talk
about it
so
here's how
it works
if you set up
and this is what
can breed
madness
mania
paranoia
megalomania
grandiosity
schizogenic
perfusion
of conceptual
linkages
of symbols
in experience
but it can also
breed insight
the others
are more common
but insight
is possible
so what it is
is if you set up
in consciousness
a set of symbols
or persons
or situations
that you're constantly
paying attention
to
in
in such a way
that it feels
like
or may indeed
be true
that your future
or your well-being
or the well-being
of your family
or loved ones
depends upon
changes
having a clear
understanding
of changes
in these
persons
situations
and so forth
we all do this
we set up these
sort of
monuments
in
consciousness
that our
lives and minds
orbit
and when we do
that
we're setting
the
what the character
of the frame
yeah
setting the character
of the frame
so
sometimes
we can allow
the character
of the frame
to be set
for us
by external symbols
for example
I just walked
past
a
book kiosk
in my neighborhood
now suppose
that I took
the titles
of those books
as precognitively
predictive
of what I should
pay attention
to in consciousness
right
so I'm going to
replace whatever
framing I might
have previously
had
with the titles
of those books
and then I'm going
to proceed
through the rest
of my day
perhaps
I could go back
and read
those titles
right now
just to give
you an example
I think
I don't need to
I can do
something simpler
I'm going to
take the
sequence of
letters and
symbols on
this license plate
8Z
HY640
and the one
that follows it
8RXZ
199
right
now if I
keep reading
the license plates
what's going
to happen
I'm going
to notice
correspondences
and even
if I don't
if I don't
replace the
ones I have
like I have
some right
is my heart
doing okay
how's my house
not my roommate
otherwise known
as let's talk
UFOs
on Reddit
who I love
my bank
accounts
the people
with whom
I'm in
fairly regular
contact
the one
or two
people
who either
depend on me
or I depend
those beings
are all
significant
we call
them
anchors
in my
consciousness
right
so if you
replace those
anchors
with something
or you add
a new anchor
and it becomes
very interesting
to you
perhaps a love
interest
or
someone you're
afraid of
someone you feel
is
somebody
who someone
has
a reason
to feel
is
conspiring
to harm
them
perhaps
physically
relationally
vocationally
or especially
magically
you can see
that what tends
to happen
is if
you set up
the frame
then reality
warps in
consciousness
toward the
things you've
set up
as anchors
right
so
this produces
the semblance
of synchronicity
and it's not
actually that there
isn't any
it's just that
it's not
necessarily
particularly
non-ordinary
consciousness
orients itself
with anchors
this is well
known in
NLP
right
neurolinguistic
programming
hypnosis
circles
magicians
know this
illusionists
know it
Darren Brown
is a
brilliant
provocateur
who utilizes
this
to astonish
ordinary
humans
and to
manipulate
them
it must
be a very
lonely
and perhaps
grandiose
life
although I
don't know
what Darren
Brown's life
is like
it's very
difficult for
me to
imagine
I do know
or at least
I have heard
that the
castle that
he owns
is filled
has many
instances
of
stuff
called
what is
that
stuff
called
not
stuffed
animals
but
preserved
carefully
embalmed
creatures
yeah
the word
almost
came
to me
a book
has just
arrived
do I
take this
as
significant
it's
Paul
L.
Ward's
selected
writings
which I
found the
book cover
for
in my
room
but could
not locate
the volume
for
yeah I
can't
I just
my
hippocampus
is failing
to find
the word
it's on
the edge
of my
tongue
and I'm
sure
it'll
come
to me
so
we
create
the
anchors
that our
sentinels
our
watchers
pay
attention
to
and
then
we
interpret
reality
according
to
transformations
in the
field
in between
the
anchors
so
this is
likely
to look
metaphysically
significant
if
somebody
for
example
if
someone
is
paying
inordinate
attention
to my
posts
and the
time
and the
day
on which
they
occur
it's
very
likely
that
there
will
be
two
effects
one
an
interpretive
effect
where
they
will
feel
that
I'm
precognitive
or in
some way
influencing
their
situation
and the
second one
more like
the latter
that I
may be
predictively
aware
or
actively
magically
so to
speak
transforming
their
situation
and
this
is
what
I
what
I
want
to
highlight
is
frame
collapse
so
we
should
be
aware
both
we
should
be
aware
okay
this
is a
power
for those
of us
who
understand
it
it's
not
a
power
to
manipulate
other
human
beings
that's
a
malignant
use
of
power
it's
a
power
to
transform
situations
if we
understand
it
clearly
it's
a
power
to
transform
our
own
minds
our
futures
our
destinies
our
memories
our
dreaming
our
relationships
it's
this
kind
of
a
power
so
we
should
but
it's
also
a
danger
right
it's
a
danger
in
that
we
may
think
we're
having
metaphysical
insight
or
experience
when
actually
what
is
happening
is
our
consciousness
is
responding
to
the
peculiar
way
we
have
set
up
that's
interesting
that's
familiar
to me
I wonder
if this
book is
around
the
peculiar
way
we
have
set
up
the
anchors
in
concern
right
in
interest
and in
awareness
that's
okay
books
it's
a
little
bit
old
but
it's
all
right
with
me
I
have
my
Paul
L.
Ward
book
that I
have
long
had
the
cover
to
but
can't
find
the
book
for
by the
way
I
love
me
some
Paul
L.
Ward
of course
in
translation
I
guess
all
right
so
pay
attention
to the
possibilities
not
merely
a
frame
collapse
but a
frame
establishment
if we
can
select
really
good
anchors
we're
going
to get
a
completely
different
mode
of
awareness
possibilities
of learning
intelligence
sensitivity
you know
possibilities
of fulfilling
the purposes
for which
we establish
sentinels
in the
first
place
especially
if we
do this
together
right
because
these
potentials
are radically
magnified
in even
small
groups
of
highly
motivated
highly
relationally
motivated
individual
quote
individual
humans
and then
I'm just
going to
touch
on the
second
topic
the
multiple
world
topic
before I
wrap up
for today
so
yes of course
there's this
multiple world
theory in
physics
whatever
who cares
I doubt
it
I very
very much
doubt it
I think
that theory
will
either be
overturned
or be
shown to
have been
extremely
partial
in other
words
what you
get are
tiny
little
paracandidate
universes
most of
which never
persist
or only
partially
emerge
but I
think
the
theory is
a
misunderstanding
of something
fundamental
about
nature
and
time
space
I
strongly
suspect
that
anyway
so yeah
what I
want to
talk
about
is
different
what I
want to
talk
about
is
that
there
are
billions
of
worlds
right
here
we
think
the
world
matches
up
with
our
usually
extremely
limited
experience
and
awareness
of it
we
think
we
know
what
the
world
is
what
humans
are
what's
being
done
what
isn't
being
done
who's
doing
it
who
isn't
doing
it
what's
possible
what
isn't
what's
historically
accurate
what
isn't
what's
futurially
accessible
what
isn't
all these
things
we think
we know
them
based on
the
incredibly
narrow
little slice
of reality
that we get
exposed to
most of
us
and some
of us
have realized
through
experiments
and so
forth
that
wow
if we
step
outside
that
slice
things
get
really
astonishingly
diverse
and
interesting
right
so
for
example
I
have
never
traveled
my
little
slice
of
reality
is
super
tiny
as far
as my
human
stuff
goes
nature
bit
different
than most
humans
time
space
different
from most
humans
because I've
had
contact
with
non-human
intelligences
and very
very few
humans
who claim
that
have had
anything
resembling
coherent
contact
with
NHI
but my
little slice
of life
if I were
to determine
what the
world is
based on
what media
reaches me
and blah
blah
blah
blah
blah
you know
I'd be
thinking
about the
world
from the
perspective
of less
than
I don't know
a millionth
of a percent
of it
so what I
want
to make
clear
is that
what's actually
going on
the world
is billions
of worlds
there are
worlds
of human
life
so far
beyond
anything
you've
ever
imagined
that they
might as
well be
other
universes
and they're
all around
us
ordinarily
what limits
us
to some
degree
the two
primary
limiting
factors
in our
world
are
proximity
and
wealth
wealth
doesn't
totally
liberate
you
in fact
it can
trap
you
in many
ways
if you
start
out
with it
especially
but
you know
my
a close
friend
has lived
a life
of
not
entire
impoverishment
but relative
poverty
and
he
lives
in a
place
where
you know
it seems
like his
prospects
are very
limited
recent
events
have
demonstrated
to him
that they
might be
far less
limited
than he'd
ever
imagined
and that
there might
even be
a couple
of avenues
to what
you know
could qualify
as space
flight
for him
in terms
of his
lived
experience
of being
human
on earth
so
what I'm
trying to
get at
is like
there are
groups of
people
and people
who are
so profoundly
advanced
and fascinating
and alive
intelligent
and confusing
brilliant
and so forth
that are
nothing like
what we think
the world
is like
this is a
world of a
billion worlds
people who
travel
eventually get
some kind
of a taste
of this
I have never
done that
I know
from having
been above
I know
from having
what the
overview
effect
that space
travelers
have
experienced
which happened
to William
Shatner
and many
of the
astronauts
right
they see
oh my
god
this is a
tiny little
droplet
of water
in a vast
immensity
unimaginable
so what I
want you to
understand
is do not
ever think
that your
capacities
are limited
to what
you've
experienced
thus far
if you
can achieve
find a way
to achieve
meaningful
coherent
escape
velocity
from the
tiny little
slice of
life
that you
become
habituated
to
and that
is familiar
to you
and may
feel safe
even if
it's
miserable
outside
that
there is
a billion
universes
right here
on this
planet
the continents
are different
worlds
think about
history
right
think about
what was
going on
in what
we call
Peru
when Egypt
was thriving
what was
going on
in China
when Egypt
was thriving
what was
going on
in Antarctica
before it
was frozen
there are
many worlds
right here
and there are
billions of
unique
human worlds
indeed
every little
shop or
home that
you enter
is like a
womb
or a
universe
it's
unique
it's
profound
it's
a
completely
different
way of
life
so
I may
pursue
this
topic
further
in
upcoming
recordings
I'm only
giving it
a provisional
sort of
tail
end
glance
before I
wrap up
here for
today
but as
always I'm
so grateful
to have
this time
with you
so thankful
for those of
you who pay
attention to
my recordings
and particularly
those of you
who support
them
like them
share them
ask questions
leave comments
and so forth
since that's
if you're
getting some
value here
remember that
I don't
allow advertising
which would be
really ironic
if I did
so I can't
there's no way
so it's your
support
that I depend
on
and I'm just
so grateful
to have this
time together
and I'm really
looking forward
to our next
adventures
in
awareness
and amnesis
and mutual
wonder
thank you for
joining me
I look forward
to learning
together
again
very soon
may your ways
be blessed
and beautiful
and may your
dreams be profound
and rich
as your
relationships
bye bye
for now
