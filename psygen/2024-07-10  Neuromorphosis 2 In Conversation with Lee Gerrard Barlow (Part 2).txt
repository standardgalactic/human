great to see you again Lee I'm so happy great to see you again Darren
um I'm really excited there's so much to cover we'll probably we'll be sort of continuing along
the lines that we established in our previous conversation uh yeah and let's see here so
part of where we left off we were talking a little bit about um how it's possible
a process that resembles the Caterpillar going into a Prisolis right where where where you can
sort of liquefy the structure of history in the self and then reforge it maybe without some of the
uh impediments right that it was um perhaps uh carrying historically and struggling with
yeah and we can return to therapy um I just want to sort of bookmark that idea
but there's a so there's a there's a span in your story previously that I'd like to revisit
it which is the span between your walk and when you begin to uh
enter
the learning process that um I think starts with NLP goes to hypnosis goes to mesmerism
and then circles back maybe to the walk and the events during it right okay yeah okay so maybe
if you can help prompt me because I'll be coming up with a lot of uh a lot of things here which will
be quite freeform but um so we spoke about in the previous interview or conversation I prefer to put it
really that we did um there was the coast to coast walk that I mentioned uh and the particular section
called the like wake walk which uh which was particularly important uh that's where I had my
what I'll call my Milky Way experience where I had the experience of connecting the heavens and the earth
through my through my physical body it was a very visceral uh experience um
and after this walk as I mentioned uh returning back to London where I was living at the time
so like I say this was around 1990 um I ended up having I was catapulted into a into a kind of
what they would call in the alchemical tradition kind of like a nigredo state
so I felt a bit a little bit like everything was disintegrating like um like I'd been ripped open
and my psychic skin was really raw and bare I was able to sense everything around me
the vibrations of all of the people around me um but in an uncomfortable way when I returned from
doing that walk which was a very joyous experience uh it was you know an incredibly joyous experience
doing that walk like I say returning to the city returning to London at that time very very difficult
now the important thing is is that during during that time
like I say it was almost like entering into a type of depressive state
but it also felt like I had terrible flu so it was all it was almost like a physical state
as well um but as I was coming out of this uh I started to come out of this
um due to a series of dreams that I started to have
this is where dreams become really important in this whole scenario we're speaking about
so I started to have lots of dreams and in in this in these dreams
dreams I think I touched on this in the previous part but I didn't go into great detail
in these dreams I um there was a specific hill that was in these dreams
and it was very very characteristic so it was the kind of thing that stuck in my head and it was a
recurring dream as well and from the top of the hill um I looked down the hill and there was some cornfields
and there was a river flowing through the cornfields and I even could see because of the dreams because
my encounters with a particular figure in these dreams that I found um there was a boat
and it was on a river and this river was within the cornfield that I could see down in the sloping valley
in the vale seen from this particular hill
and inside this boat was a goddess-like figure
a feminine figure
and every time I got into the boat with her
we would go for a ride
and every night we would go a little further
and this this ride down the river
was going from the from the vision of the hill from the view of the hill looking down the river flowed
left to the left
so I got into the boat
with her and every time I woke up
I felt an immense surge of healing energy
so I was this dream I noticed was beginning to act as a as a as a kind of medicine
it was healing me every single night every night that I had the dream
I was looking forwards to actually being back there again
and sure enough every now and again it kept coming back
and this dream would just heal me a little bit more
and this is what got me out of whatever it was I was I was in at the time
do you have any impression about
how did you think about the woman the boat and the river
but particularly the woman about her identity
did you was it a matter of concern to you
weirdly no
I just knew that she represented some kind of
divine feminine force
that she was
somehow a personification of nature
that I was meeting in this boat
and
and that's
that's all that really concerned me
can you describe her
from your recollection
I mean maybe she doesn't have a specific appearance
but what do you recall
well I do recall that she had long hair
I do recall that she had a long dress
I think it was white
if I remember
I don't I don't have full recollection of that
but
the dream mind is
a wooden rowing boat
I remember that
yeah I mean the dreaming mind isn't as concerned with what we might think of as particulars
okay
doesn't need them
but it was a cornfield
that that I find significant
the fact that it was a cornfield
yes
and
this takes place looking down from Knapp Hill
right
that's right
that's right
but I didn't know it was called Knapp Hill
I see
now
I've mentioned this to you obviously in private
but the thing is
is I had no idea
who this person was
I had no idea
where this place was
it was a dream
but you see
in 1994
in the summer
I think it was the summer of 1994
there was a couple of friends of mine
I used to work on markets
in London
I used to sell
old 50s rock and roll
collectible records
and 60s psychedelic stuff
and things like that
and a couple of my friends there
I got chatting with them
on the stall
and they just said to me
let's
they knew I had a van
so they were
and we had similar interests
we discovered
and they said
should we take a trip out to the west country
would you take us
and I said sure
you know
I'd love to do that
so
we got in the van
and went looking for crop circles
so this is in the summer of 1994
and whereabouts are you
when you're
on this journey
yeah
you mean in terms of
geography
where are you going
geography
right
okay
so we got in the car
in the van
and we drove out of London
and went over to
over to
the area of Avebury
which is
you know
a really amazing place
for those who've never been there
look it up
it's in Wiltshire
which is in the west country
and
we were looking around
for all of these crop circles
and we found one or two that day
around
around Avebury
around
sort of in that vicinity
in the fields around
drive out of London
to Avebury
and you find
crop circles
just out there
without even knowing
where you're going
there's no
there's no internet
right
you're not like
no there was no internet
no internet
you're just adventuring out
in your van
and you come across
crop circles
and I find that
kind of surprising
but I'm listening
please continue
well
as the story
actually goes
is the fact that
we actually
basically all three of us
agreed that
all of the crop circles
we found that day
I think it was two or three
we saw
were kind of just
fake
okay
and it was kind of
crop circle
season
right
okay
I follow
yeah
yeah
so
there were
supposedly
some around
or so they'd heard
which is what spurred them on
to want to go
and do the
you know
do the trip
so we went out there
and all day
we were looking
for these things
we found
two or three
like I say
and
but we weren't convinced
they seemed a bit
scrappy
and a bit
kind of
you know
like
maybe some teenagers
had knocked it up
overnight
you know
sort of thing
so
we sort of
were
everyone was a bit
disappointed
we'd had a great trip out
but everyone was really tired
and it was the end of the day
we'd been traipsing around
all day
through these
fields
and cornfields
and stuff
and I just got
this thought
as a driver
thought
oh
how about
taking a different route
let's
let's go
just take a
random route off
and go up
through another
through another route
another way
instead of going
the main roads home
let's go off
some
some other way
so we did this
and I didn't really know
the area
apart from maybe
a couple of the main routes
around there
and all of a sudden
like
as we were going through
all of these
open plains
I suddenly saw
the way the road
swooped up
to the right
there was a
there was a track
a path
coming away from the road
and as soon as I saw this
I had this
immense impetus
this impulse
to just
stop the car
and get out
and walk up that track
so I did
and of course
they were really
really tired
and they were
they were complaining
it's like
oh we've not found anything
you've been walking all day
we're really really tired
and we were supposed to be
on the way home
so I
said
you can wait here
and so they did
they waited in the van
and I
traipsed on up the track
so I got out
got out of the van
traipsed up the track
and went to the top
of this track
the top of the hill
so when I got
when I got to the top
I
I
stood there
and looked
down across the hill
lo and behold
I was absolutely
transfixed
by the fact that
what I had in front of me
was exactly what I'd seen
in my dreams
at least
five years earlier
so back in
like I say
coming from the coast to coast
back in 1990
so about
four or five years earlier
I'd seen this
very very place
in my dreams
you can't ignore that
when that happens
you're there
looking at the scene
and lo and behold
there is the
there is the valley
there is the river
snaking through
exactly the same place
hmm
ah
and while this is in my mind
right now
I must mention this
just in case
it's not completed
it's only about
a month ago
I think just before
our interview
the last interview
we had
that I met
a lady
through a mutual friend
around here
where I live
and
she actually revealed
what I understand
to be the actual
name
of this particular
goddess
that I'd
that I'd come across
okay
this is the thing
I was having
for capacity
right
I sensed
like
she is someone
who is she
I'm listening
yeah
please
right
now
I feel it's maybe
not the right
circumstance
to reveal that name
okay
I understand that
yeah
and such things
there are some things
that it is important
to keep private
yeah
and also to not
speak about
that's right
and I honor
and you can feel
that viscerally
you can feel
don't speak of it
yes yes
good
yes I honor this
and understand
yeah
but please continue
I'm with you
in actual fact
all I've mentioned
up till this point
including the fact
that there was
this feminine figure
it was a goddess figure
it was there in the boat
it was revealed in a dream
these parts
until very recently
I've had a
do not speak about it
oh wow
okay
so what
it's only now
I'm beginning to speak about it
wow
so do you have any sense
of what the change
what change
that made you feel
more comfortable
to speak of it
that's an interesting question
in my
in my physical body
my body is telling
telling me
it's okay to mention it
it's a visceral sensation
there's a stop feeling
when you know
that something
yes
is not the time
to speak about it
yes it's funny
that you say that
because
you know
we have this
colloquialism
in English
what we call
the still
small voice
right
right
and also
I think
though I'm not an expert
on this topic
Socrates'
daimon
yeah
what it primarily
did was just say no
yeah
didn't tell him
what to do
it didn't have
they didn't have
conversations
at least not
in the records
that we have
the one thing
that we know
about it
is it tells him
just don't
this is
don't do this
or
it might say
you made a mistake
right
yeah
yeah
and so
there's this
interesting
in my own
experience
with this
a couple times
in my life
I heard
it tell me
it
whatever it is
right
don't
just
like
no
yeah
and not
and there
I've had other
experiences
of
you know
sort of a
daimonic
intelligence
or whatever
but I
I honor
that
and I
want to
just mention
that
I have a
close friend
who works
with neurodivergent
people
yeah
and her
prime
one of her
primary
areas of
expertise
is a
process
called
positive
disintegration
okay
and when
you were
talking about
what took
place
when you
returned
to London
it has
the earmarks
of this
process
right
and she
talks about
it as
in a variety
of senses
but it's
it's quite
fascinating
because she
says that
it's a
it's a
it's a
somatic
array
it's an
array of
somatic
intelligences
and you
talk about
feeling that
you had
the flu
but you
also talk
about having
these extra
sensitivities
where you
can feel
people's
energy
and things
like this
right
yeah
yeah
but it
sort of
has the
earmarks
of this
process
I
recognize
from my
recent
discussion
with her
a similarity
there
okay so
you've
you met
a woman
somewhat
recently
she revealed
to you
and I
presume that
when she
revealed this
it was
resonant
you were
like
or how
did you
feel
yeah
actually
I was
absolutely
gobsmacked
because
the very
moment
that
and the
odd thing
is
the fact
that I
was describing
this
specific
place
also
caused
a huge
reaction
and huge
explosion
for her
also
because
she said
I can't
believe
the
synchronicity
of what
you're
describing
to me
she said
it was
literally
just last
night
for the
very
first
time
that I
was
earmarking
that
very
place
you're
telling
me
about
to
actually
go and
visit
it
and
then
she
revealed
to me
the
actual
name
of
this
particular
goddess
figure
so it
was
kind
of
like
a
mutual
explosive
amazing
sort
of
cross
flow
of
information
and
yes
I
definitely
feel
it's
not
the
right
time
to
talk
about
the
name
I'm
not
saying
that
for
the
sake
of
theory
to
be
this
is
trivial
what
we're
doing
here
is
beautiful
and
profound
for
me
but
this
is
not
the
place
for
this
kind
of
I
just
honor
the
fact
that
there's
some
things
we
shouldn't
speak
openly
and
particularly
publicly
or
even
on
recordings
about
yeah
okay
so
I
mean
I
just
have
a
couple
questions
about
this
how
did
you
come
across
this
person
how
long
have
you
known
them
what
was
the
tell
me
something
about
that
that's
the
peculiar
thing
I
I'd
never
well
actually
funnily
enough
I'd
I'd
seen
this
person
a couple
of
times
and
you
know
there'd
been
an
acknowledgement
like
I was
recognized
and so
on
but
there'd
been
no
interaction
and
there's
been
no
interaction
since
either
it was
purely
just
on this
day
I was
there to
meet
someone
else
entirely
and it
happened
to be
one of
these
talks
over
a
coffee
table
that
ended
up
sort
of
spilling
out
and
oddly
you know
somehow
probably
because of
the company
I was in
the conversation
turned in
that direction
and
and
and just
strangely
these
hugely
important
missing
fragments
of
information
that
I'd
been
hanging
on
waiting
for
these
extra
pieces
to arrive
for years
and this
very much
touches on
something
central to
my own
personal
attitude
towards
receiving
gnosis
or
you know
how it
happens
with
dreams
with
actual
encounters
whenever you
receive
anything
what seems
to be
significant
at the
time
I take
quite a
detached
approach
to it
I don't
let myself
get
over
attached
or
overexcited
by
anything
which
seems
significant
what I
tend to
do
is I
tend to
sort of
earmark
the events
or earmark
these things
and put
them
on the
shelf
so to
speak
to let
them
hang
around
because I
have
absolute
faith
or
certainty
in one
way or
another
that
these
things
will be
answered
or I
will
understand
their
true
significance
even if
I have
to wait
years
for it
to happen
and this
was a
really good
example
of what
I'm saying
because I
take life
as one
whole
if you
like
so there
are things
that we
might be
experiencing
now
in our
esoteric
internal
experiences
in our
dreams
in our
personal
revelations
of any
kind
or
synchronicities
significant
synchronicity
which I
have no
doubt
we will
find the
answers to
20 years
from now
I have
full faith
of that
there's no
rush about
this
so
it's
it's
really
interesting
to hear
you say
this
because
I trust
the wisdom
of the
intelligences
in you
that have
this sense
of
no need
to get
super excited
about this
put this
on the
shelf
let it
let it
sort of
I don't know
what the word
is right
be enriched
by time
or
you know
sort of like
age
let it age
yeah
right
and then
in time
it will
become clear
the thing
that I find
funny about
that is
I'm
completely
the opposite
and it
gets me
in trouble
I get
super excited
right
and so
I can
become so
excited
and enchanted
that I get
very spun
up
and then
various things
it doesn't
always lead
to disaster
but sometimes
it does
right
I'm
I'm
disoriented
by my
by the
excitement
and the
enchantment
and when
one is
disoriented
you know
yeah
untoward
events may
occur
okay
so
there's a
number of
threads here
and I have
them fairly
well organized
in my
mind
you mentioned
in private
conversation
earlier
yeah
the
like
wake
walk
why don't
you tell
the audience
a little bit
about the
definitions
of those
two terms
and what
they came
to mean
for you
right
okay
so
like I
said
back in
1990
I
undertook
the
like
wake
walk
which
was
part
of
the
coast
to
coast
walk
so
I'll
just
recap
very
quickly
from
what
I
explained
a little
bit
of
in
the
previous
part
no
we
did
England
is
a bit
like
a
hand
the
coast
to
coast
walk
of
course
goes
directly
from
the
east
to
the
west
coast
name
the
starting
and ending
places
if you
don't
mind
yeah
so
on the
west
coast
would
sorry
on the
west
coast
which
would be
if this
was the
hand
of
England
you know
this is
Scotland
up here
this is
Northumbria
and
here
here
here
is
the
Pennine
ridge
running
down
the
middle
the
lake
district
over
on
the
west
is
sort
of
where
we
started
so
it's
kind
of
like
from
the
west
coast
over
to
the
east
coast
of
course
this
would
be
Cornwall
London
somewhere
over
here
the
Cornwall
is
a bit
like
where
the
thumb
is
so
you
would
travel
across
starting
starting
well
in this
instance
I started
from
the
west
coast
going
to
the
east
yes
but
what
is
the
place
where
you
started
the
name
if
you
don't
know
it's
St
B's
Head
great
thank
you
St
B's
Head
so
going
from
St
B's
Head
and
then
going
across
the
Lake
District
crossing
the
Pennine
Ridge
which
was
very
peculiar
I've
just
remembered
I
may
as
well
say
these
things
as
they're
coming
into
my
mind
couple
on
the
top
of
the
Pennine
watershed
really
boggy
watershed
in
mist
a
really
old
couple
who
were
happening
to
walk
this
particular
stretch
of
the
Pennine
Ridge
and
so
I
kind
of
started
chatting
to
them
in
the
middle
of
mist
in
the
middle
of
nowhere
and
I
thought
this
is
interesting
this
lady
I
said
to
the
lady
old
gent
old
lady
I
said
to
the
older
lady
I
said
your
accent
sounds
quite
familiar
like it
sounds like
it's from
where I
grew up
which is
a place
called
Akworth
which I
grew up
in as
a small
child
which is
an old
oak grove
originally
it was
part of
an old
druidic
oak grove
up on
a moortop
and she
said
oh yeah
I come
from a
place
near
to
Leeds
because
don't
forget
this is
the
Pennine
Ridge
here
it's
sort
of
on
the
way
to
it's
almost
closer
to
Manchester
really
at this
particular
point
so she
could have
been from
anywhere up
north
but I
said
no
she
identified
her
accent
she
said
no
I'm
from
closer
to
Pontefract
Wakefield
outside
of
Leeds
I said
oh
so
am
I
so
am
I
she said
well
do you
know
a place
called
Aqueth
I said
well
yes
it's
the
village
I
grew up
in
and she
goes
oh
really
she said
well
I lived
on
Mortop
in
Aqueth
I said
well
that's
interesting
because
I lived
on Mortop
in
Aqueth
as well
and
it turned
out
she said
oh
well
you know
that big
house
near to
the roundabout
there's
a
it used
to be
called
it's
now
called
the
Elm
Tree
restaurant
well
that was
my house
when I
was a
child
I said
well
my house
is literally
joined onto
your house
it's part
it's the
coach house
that belonged
to your
house
she goes
oh
the coach
house
I said
yes
so she
was
she was
literally
my next
door
neighbour
her house
was
literally
physically
joined
onto
the house
I grew
up in
surely
it has
occurred
to you
that this
might not
be an
ordinary
couple
it has
while I was
actually
speaking to
you now
it
it kind
of started
to dawn
upon me
I was
beginning to
think I was
describing the
mist and
everything
and I was
thinking to
myself
hmm
yeah because
what she's
saying in
a way
is
in code
right
in a way
that wouldn't
necessarily
reveal it
she's saying
you and I
have been
associated
our entire
lives
right
which is the
kind of thing
that for
example the
moon might
say
yes
you were to
meet the
moon
yes
and it's
very common
in
I'm not
making any
claims about
what took
place with
you
right
sure
I'm just
noticing
that
it's common
in indigenous
stories
for a
very elderly
couple
to appear
oh
right
and
I didn't
know this
yes
yes
very very
elderly
couple
appears
and they
may appear
frail or
weak
and they
often look
quite old
and it's
it's very
strange to
find an
elderly couple
out in the
middle of
wherever you
were
like wandering
around in
the mist
I mean
yeah
yeah
you know
where
what are
they doing
like I know
what you're
doing and
you're a
young guy
and you're
you know
you're on
a quest
yeah
and since
you're on
a quest
and you
encounter an
elderly couple
but in
many cases
it's not
clear to the
people at
the time
that the
elderly couple
represent the
sun and the
moon
but they
often do
right
and it's
it's quite
often that
the sun
may give
a gift
or the
moon may
give
knowledge
but yeah
it's
I just
can't help
but notice
the strange
uh
uh
like it's
not metaphor
there's another
word for it
that I don't
know what it
is
but the
um
analogy
shape
likeness
uh-huh
in what
she's saying
oh you
go through
a series
of steps
right
oh you
sound like
oh yes
you you
know do
you know
this you
know and
then and
then it
just traverses
to we've
been there
the whole
time like
we've been
together the
whole time
in in the
strange way
right our
origins are
linked up
right so
that's very
profound and
I'm grateful
to hear that
story I'm
glad we
glad you
came across
it please
continue
yeah uh a
couple of other
things have just
dawned on me
because you've
pointed this
out and
that's the
wonderful thing
about doing
these sessions
with you is
that you know
all of these
new parts of
insight suddenly
spring up while
I'm in the
middle of speaking
to you um
so the
Pennine Ridge
is quite
literally I
mean it's
known as the
backbone of
England but
what's
significant
about this
from the
west to
the east
is that
it's the
threshold
between
them
so this
watershed
was quite
literally
the the
the barrier
the physical
barrier
that divides
Yorkshire
from Lancashire
so you've
heard of
the war of
the roses
the red
rose and
the white
rose
but they're
quite literally
divided by
these two
sides and
what's what
suddenly came
upon me
uh is the
fact that the
old man was
from Lancashire
and she was
from Yorkshire
which was
where I was
from
so so you
literally had
a Yorkshire
man and a
Yorkshire woman
and a
Lancashire man
on this
particular
threshold
between the
two halves
of the walk
yeah this
curiouser and
curiouser
yeah yeah
yeah
yeah
beautiful
interesting
interesting
it's wonderful
to have these
conversations
uh just to
document this
stuff as well
you know
because
this is the
thing you
know when
we um
it's often
helpful to
have a
companion
to lead
us along
and help
with the
the sort
of uh the
sequencing
right but
when you
begin to
recover
I'll just
mention this
very briefly
so yeah
my roommate
recently came
to me and
said you know
totally up to
you if you
want to do
this but
let's talk
if you want
let's record
like a life
history thing
you know
okay so we
started doing
this not for
public sharing
or anything
for like my
own use
and you
know all
those things
started lighting
up because
you're you're
resurrecting these
moments and
they link they
start to link
together and
the whole map
starts to light
up and that
brings to mind
perspectives you
hadn't you know
perhaps you haven't
seen before um
so let's not get
too uh sidetracked
by that please
please continue
so you come
across the couple
go ahead
yeah yeah I
came across the
the couple um
and it was on
this particular
threshold area
um I mentioned
it was a
watershed as
well so
basically all
of the rivers
flow flow
down from
this place
over the
pennine ridge
itself so
so it's it's
a source of
rivers and
lakes
um so
where was I
going with
this so
uh after
this point of
course you
cross over
and then you're
going into
east yorkshire
into the
east part of
the country
and into
yorkshire
and then it's
from there
that you pick
up after
after a very
small area
i think it's
called appleby
westmoreland
remember we
we walked
through a place
called appleby
in westmoreland
um and you go
through there
that was a very
beautiful area
it's almost like a
very edenic
very very edenic
kind of feel
very lush and
green and
full of apple
blossoms and
apple trees
um and
and that was
an interesting
place as well
um because
that had that
had some
resonance later
but i won't
talk about that
now um
and then you
join on to the
beginning of the
like wake walk
so i think you
mentioned a little
earlier tell
everyone about
the like wake
walk itself
yeah the meanings
of the words
and how you
yeah so the
like wake
walk um
like l y k e
so the like
is the corpse
itself but
another interpretation
is the double
that which is
a like to
you that which
is like you
but if you're
departed
and if
you're if
you're departed
so in like in
the egyptian uh
cosmology to
call it that
you have the
cat or the
mummy the
mumia the
body the
corpse the
like and
then above
that you
have the
car and
the car is
like the
ghost body
so the the
the more
closer to the
ghost body
if you like
so it's the
habitual body
um in
kabbalistic
terminology they
would call it
like the
nefesh the
animal soul
that which
hangs around
the body or
hangs around
the corpse
so if you
were say for
example the
like from
the point of
view of the
nefesh or
from the
point of view
of the car
you would be
separated
from your
physical body
but close
to it
so the
like is
your double
your doppelganger
in some sense
and the
wake is
like in
in irish
you know
in irish
ceremonies when
you have
somebody who's
passed over
they hold
a wake
so the
wake is
is the
celebration
of the
person's
life
and you
usually have
a good
old
knees up
you know
around the
grave of
the
person
it's
quite often
with the
person
physically
present
there in
the room
so that's
the traditional
irish style
of having
a wake
celebration
of the
person's
life
now
this is
the like
wake walk
it covers
40 miles
and this
40 mile
expanse
which 40
miles in
itself is
obviously
heavily
symbolic
as well
because it's
all the
number 40
is always
linked with
passages
of moving
from one
state
to another
like 40
days and
40 nights
in the
biblical
symbolism
you have
you have
quite often
in quite a
lot of
Tibetan
Buddhist
internal
work they
have like
40 day
passages
through dark
through darkness
or should
we say
a 40
day and
40 night
passage
through darkness
just total
darkness
in some
of their
works
with five
days on
either side
right
as like
the lead
in
then you
have one
moon
and then
the string
out
yes
so you
get
similar
it's like
it's
it could
be understood
as a
lifespan
even
I'm with
you
please
continue
yeah
yeah
I think
I think
indeed
indeed
and
so
the
it was
on this
particular
part of
the walk
the
the like
wake
walk
over this
40 mile
expanse
which
that's
where I
saw them
where I
had my
Milky Way
experience
which was
incredibly
profound
incredibly
significant
for everything
that followed
say a little
bit about
the experience
again even
though I'm
sure you
have
previously
I did
but I
can go a
little more
into granular
detail this
time so
so it
was the
time of
year let's
see it
was the
beginning
of August
end of
August beginning
September
and this
point in
time was
deliberately
chosen
because it
wouldn't be
too searingly
hot so it
was the
end of
summer
coming into
autumn
so there
was the
weather was
kind of
quite
temperate
but I
do remember
the entire
walk up to
this point
had actually
been quite
bloody hot
actually
all through
the Lake
District
and so on
apart from
maybe some
misty and
rainy days
halfway through
on the
Pennine
Ridge
so going
on to
the
lightweight
walk
these
incredibly
blue
sonic
blue
sky
but the
lightweight
walk itself
passes through
this 40 mile
expanse known
as Winnie
Moor
now Winnie
Moor
is
actually in
old English
means the
wine red
moor
Winnie
wine red
so the
wine red
Winnie
Moor
so you're
passing
through the
Winnie
Moor
so it's
a form
of abyss
it's a
type of
abyssal
symbolism
and what
it actually
I've later
come to
understand
what I've
actually come
to understand
it means
is that
you're
actually
passing
through
the
menstruation
period
of the
goddess
beautiful
because the
track
takes you
through the
track of
death
so it's
very Scorpio
laden
it's very
very Scorpionic
Scorpio
symbolism
but it's
all wine
red
it's like
a menstruation
period
now this
is interesting
and it just
dawned on me
right now
as I'm
speaking
that perhaps
this is why
and where
the goddess
symbolism
came from
that led
me out
of the
dream
which is
really
amazing
how that's
just
dawned
on me
so
truly
you know
I mean
some
quite
revelatory
thoughts
come to
me
even
while
speaking
here
now
that's
so
beautiful
this is
what
I'm
hoping
for
yes
yeah
and
the
actual
the actual
track
is laden
with
marker
points
marker
posts
and those
marker
posts
are
actually
carved
I have
a book
with me
I'll
show you
some
pictures
I'll
try and
find
some
pictures
yes
the
marker
posts
themselves
are
ancient
pagan
standing
stones
which
mark
the
track
some
of
them
have
been
turned
into
some
of
them
have
been
turned
into
crosses
were
carved
into
Celtic
crosses
here
we
go
but
quite
a few
of them
are still
pagan
standing
stones
this
is
I
don't
know
if
you
can
see
yes
this
face
here
and
some
of
them
are
just
many
as
typical
many
years
so
over
the
40
mile
expanse
the
way
you
find
your
way
is
by
spotting
these
stones
on
the
hill
ridges
as
you're
walking
along
the
track
and
all
of
the
heather
the
reason
why
it's
the
wine
red
more
is
because
all
of
the
heather
goes
sonic
purple
red
so
with
the
blue
sky
and
the
sonic
purple
red
the
weather
had
been
very
much
like
this
clear
blue
sonic
purple
red
and
these
standing
stones
marking
the
way
along
the
way
and
some
of
them
are
actually
goddess
stones
as
well
one
of
them
is
called
Fat
Betty
so
there
we
have
it
that's
actually
the
destination
of
where
it
goes
raven
scar
right
so
that's
where
you
actually
stop
raven
scar
and
the
actual
emblem
for
the
walking
for
the
light
way
is
a
candle
inside
interestingly
I
decided
to
light
a
candle
before
I
actually
started
this
interview
beautiful
so
there you
go
a little
bit more
information
there for
you
but it
came across
to me
very much
that the
wine red
more
is actually
the menstruation
of the
goddess
yes
that's
crucially
beautiful
we can
return
to this
topic
but I
want to
keep on
the thread
that we're
on
and I'm
trying to
carefully
track that
to describe
a little
bit more
about the
experience
so I'm
just going
to say
something
briefly
sure
there was
a phase
before my
own experience
where I
used to
practice
a sort
of a
Tai Chi
Chi
Gong
practice
actually
where
basically
my teacher
had taught
us
to gather
up the
energy
from the
earth
bring it
up into
the
body
distribute
it up
into the
sky
right
into the
universe
and then
draw the
universal
energy
back down
into our
body
and down
into the
earth
right
so you
basically
just
you
lean
over
you
pick up
the
energy
bent
over
you
draw it
up
into
your
bodies
with
an
in
breath
you
you know
you send
it up
with an
out
breath
you draw
it back
with an
in
breath
you send
it down
with an
out
breath
yeah
and i added
to that
practice
that i was
drawing
the love
of the
planet
all together
all the
animals
all the
living places
all the
histories
that love
into the
energy
and then
you know
sort of
like
many branches
of a tree
sending that
love out
into the
universe
literally saying
like we
love you
we remember
you
we adore
you
and then
the same
thing back
right
we love
you
we remember
you
we adore
you
back into
the earth
i used to
do this
all the
time
without
having any
complex
intellection
about it
right
and when
you talked
about your
experience with
the milky way
i was reminded
of this
this practice
right
so please
share whatever
comes to mind
about the
experience
yeah
so um
it had been
really hot
i remember
during that
day
um
and there
was a
i put up
the tent
in the middle
of this
moor
and i chose
to put the
tent
uh
in a field
at the side
of an inn
so it was
like a
pub
an inn
in the middle
of nowhere
um
and i went
into the
pub
and uh
in those
days i
hardly used
to drink
at all
i used
to have
like lime
and soda
something like
that you
know like
i wasn't
even drinking
i went
into the
pub
and uh
had a
couple of
these lime
and sodas
or whatever
and came
back out
to the
tent
and i was
shocked
to find
that after
the sun
had gone
down
that there
was a
there was
a light
frost
on the
ground
because the
moors out
there were
very exposed
and uh
there was a
couple of
other things
i learned
uh at that
time as
well which
taught me
some really
interesting
things to
do with
the action
of of
the sun
upon the
earth
and interacting
with the
earth and
the waters
um which
actually led
me to some
really really
quite
amazing
understandings
of of the
the entire
process of
nature
you i was
going to use
the word
it taught
me quite a
lot of
the secrets
of alchemy
but that
sounds really
that sounds
really uh
grandiose
but i don't
think we have
to be too
afraid of
that it
truly did
and and
i'll explain
a little more
of that
later but
that day
the frost
was on the
ground
or that
evening the
frost was on
the ground
the temperature
had dropped
quite quite a
lot and
um and
because it
was so
cold and
because the
sky was so
clear and
because there
was no light
pollution
whatsoever i
looked at the
frost crunch
crunch crunch
feet on the
floor crunch
crunch crunch
so my attention
was diverted
down by the
crunching and
then i lifted
my head up i
wanted to just
instinctively wanted
to know what
was right above
me so crunching
feet
lifted up
the head
my my the
trajectory of
my vision
literally caught
from the very
moment my head
was lifted
the whole path
of the milky
way just shot
up in front of
me and above
me all the
way behind me
and it felt
like the entire
thing from from
right above me
right through my
feet just like
the two things
just collided and
like like a huge
bang and this
intense visceral
feeling of
absolute
connectivity
like an
explosion coming
from within the
core of me
reaching out
forever
everything met
in that moment
so there was
something really
really special
about it
it was like
yoga in the
true sense of
the word
true union
so beautiful
yeah it was it
was it really
was very
touching for
some reason to
hear this story
yeah
please continue
it it ever
since that time
i've not been
able to
comprehend
anything as
separate
what a gift
what a what a
healing
inversion
yeah it also
comes with a
great price
though it
seems
um because
the
although that's
a although
that's a huge
understanding
in and of
itself
and like you
say uh could
be seen to be
a gift
it's it's uh
i think the i
think the buddists
would have called
it
you know it
leads to the
vision of
universal sorrow
oh
in the sense
that although
you you
understand the
pure joy
that's behind
everything
you can see
and sense
and this is what
led me to that
sorrow when i
came back to
the city
there was this
understanding that
everyone is so
disconnected from
that reality
that such great
pain and
suffering
results
because
of the lack
of understanding
of the
connectivity
and i
understood that
all healing
is rooted in
bringing people
back to that
sense of
connectivity
yes and
thus in
some sense
perhaps you
will understand
i'd be surprised
if you didn't
what i mean
when i say
i'll try
i'll have a go
i doubt
you'll have
any trouble
many of my
closest friends
these are
people who i
would call
bridge
bridge souls
right they
join
they join
two ordinarily
disparate
it's funny i'm
looking at my
reflection it's
backwards so
i'm missing
the wrong
yeah
yeah they
join um
two ordinarily
disparate
uh
peoples
places
histories
futures
so for
example one
of my
friends um
brian first
diver he's a
blackfoot beaver
man and
he's so
uh in in
the blackfoot
uh traditional
in their in
their traditional
life the
beaver man is
the central
ceremonial
all this all
the other
societies orbit
the beaver
uh bundle
tradition and
so he's and
he's half uh
you know he's
half caucasian
too so so he
joins like the
colonizers and
the blackfoot
people he
also uh
takes care of
rattlesnakes
there so they
are protected
there so he
joins the
snake people to
the to the
regular people
he's like this
bridge between
five or six
different things
i just use him
as an example
because he's a
great example
of this but
many of my
close friends
are like this
they're they're
the between
right and even
when you're
telling the story
you're saying
like the the
sky came down
and the earth
and they you
know they
joined right
yeah so
it's a it
but but say
more about
was it painful
for you
in in what
time what
respect
right um
you say
that um
you weren't
able to see
things as
separate and
i say oh
that's a gift
and you say
yes but
there's a
price
yes it
seems there
is a price
did the
price have
bite
in you
yeah it
can do
it can do
because because
sometimes um
you know if
sometimes you
you can't
uh it's
it's quite
it's quite
difficult to
sometimes see
uh the
the disconnection
the the lack
of connectivity
i think is
the the way
to put it
with with
certain individuals
that you know
it's quite painful
to see the lack
of connectivity
that they actually
have and
there's nothing
you can
there's nothing
you can do
the only thing
you can do
is do things
in an incredibly
subtle way
to help coax
people towards
this um
experience or
this understanding
so that brings
up a topic
that i think
you'll
that i think
is relevant
here yeah
particularly
uh and as
it relates
to human
communication
in general
yes
um
the difference
but the
common difference
between men
and women
yeah
uh
and hypnosis
nlp
perhaps mesmerism
but certainly
the idea
of suggestion
which is something
this is a topic
we didn't properly
explore previously
one of my bookmarks
so
um
i've noticed
i've always
uh tended
to emulate
girls
when i was in
elementary school
they were the
high performers
they could do
seven things
the boys could do
two
i emulated
the girls
right
um
and i learned
very quickly
that that was
a much faster
path to progress
in general
uh and the
women are
masters of
indirection
generally speaking
right
they can suggest
very subtly
something
they're very
cautious about
making direct
statements
because they can
then be held
to task for
it later
and they've
been
historically
subjected
to masculine
inquisition
every
like
a billion
times
per lifetime
right
every woman
right
um
masculine
in
in
inquisition
um
you know
so
uh
where am i
going with
this
um
i myself
have realized
we spoke
briefly of this
in the last
interview
that there are
problems with
declarative
statements
and what you
were saying
was
essentially
what you
can do
has to be
very subtle
by which i
think you
mean indirect
and suggestive
rather than
the typical
masculine thing
is just to go
like well of
course you
just do
this
right
you just
tell them
here's the
problem
here's the
solution
right
the guy
you know
uh
what
brings out
his toolbox
you know
when
and and
often
doesn't
there's no
subtlety
whatsoever
and and
there's also
no
sensitivity
to the
other
person's
sort of
where they
are in
the process
what might
be appropriate
at this
moment
or in
the in
the phase
of the
process
that they're
in
yeah
yeah
so yeah
please
anything
comes to
mind
about
this
well
once again
um
i mean
there's two
things
obviously
there's the
therapeutic
approaches
there's the
actual
use of
these
things
for
for
therapy
within a
therapeutic
setting
um
which is
one thing
and then
there's the
things that
we encounter
and uh
the things
we experience
in daily
everyday
life
in terms
of how
we
um
what we
see
around
us
uh
the types
of
interactions
you see
amongst
people
you know
friends
that you
may have
and so
on
and so
on
um
and just
generally
um
i mean
like you
say
you've
studied
language
patterns
and so
on
and so
forth
it's
it's
amazing
how
i think
i think
nlp
just to
talk about
that for
a moment
that really
highlighted
um
you know
the old
saying the
map is
not the
territory
uh
it's
it's
it's
kind of
what i'm
talking about
that disconnect
that some
individuals have
between
what's going
on in
their own
minds
and how
they choose
to communicate
those ideas
and um
and such
things
simple things
as the
art of
conversation
and so
on
you know
it seems
i don't
i don't know
if i'm right
or wrong
by saying
this but
i've
i've noticed
a marked
increase
i'd be
interested in
your opinion
on this
a marked
increase
in a
kind of
almost a
fragmentation
of the
ability to
communicate
in a
meaningful
manner
in a
way
whereby
individuals
can
actually
have
meaningful
conversations
where people
have the
ability to
listen
and have
the ability
to speak
and be
heard
these
this cross
flow
this dance
which seemed
to be so
much part
of everyday
life
seems to be
becoming
rarer and
rarer i
would say
in the
last
three or
four years
and i
don't know
if there's
a breakdown
experiencing
this
yeah there's
there's some
kind of a
you know my
friend was
using the
phrase
positive
disintegration
right
but i'm not
sure it's
positive
there's
certainly a
disintegration
going on
and i
would
you know
we can
talk about
this
i'm
careful
i want
to be
careful
to preserve
the threads
yes
i
so one
of the
things i pay
attention to
is a
neologism
that occurred
to me
at the
beginning
of my
experience
of
whatever
it was
i
the experience
was
where i
imagined
the network
of human
minds
as an
as a
place
as a
physical
environment
and
i call
that the
human
cognizant
there are
cognizant all
around us
that feed
into ours
um
but
the human
cognizant is
undergoing a
series of
what look like
catastrophic
fragmentations
yeah
and that's
being reflected
in
um
dissonance
in human
communication
and particularly
in our
perceptions
related
i mean
this is
kind of
a running
joke
at the
moment
but in
our
perceptions
related to
identity
right
someone is
what
something is
why
its
function
um
and i was
talking with
a friend
last night
and we
often have
very playful
revelatory
conversations
and i
suggested to
him
that without
us knowing
it
over the
past few
years
the world
is no
longer the
world
like it's a
completely
different thing
now
it looks the
same on the
outside
it seems to be
we all think
it's the same
thing but it's
not that thing
anymore
it's a different
thing
and so we
were we
were sort
of playfully
um
i was suggesting
that we
could experiment
by sending
signals to the
world like
pinging it
like in a
submarine
right when
you ping
another
submarine
you could
ping the
world and
see what
it brings
back so
that you
could get
a sense
of what
whatever it
has become
or what it
is becoming
yeah well i
think that
that's to
some extent
what we're
what we're
kind of doing
now is
yes yes
i think that
part of the
thing that's
certainly driving
me on to
speak about
these things
and maybe
driving you
on to speak
about these
things is
because it's
it feels like
an important
time to to
speak of these
things in a
way where one
hopes uh
others are
going to be
uh giving us
some feedback
with regards to
what's going
on yes drawn
into the
conversation and
fascinated and
curious and and
have a sense of
wonder and
exploration with
us
absolutely
yes yeah
as if maybe
we are um
what uh
uh i can't
find quite
find the
word it's
it's strange
because in a
way you
can i i
imagine
something actually
this i don't
know why but
it's bringing
it makes me
feel tearful
i imagine
two magicians
not that i'm
claiming to be
one or that
you claim to
be one but
but i imagine
two magicians
playfully getting
together on
stage
and embodying
the curiosity
and passion
and life
paths of
the audience
without the
magicians
themselves
knowing it
right and
and then
engaging in
this play
on the
stage that
enlightens the
magicians as
the avatars of
the audience
something like
this right
and what
yeah
what a
beautiful
like ecstatic
figure
yeah absolutely
and i i feel
that we're at
a very very
interesting time
most definitely
certainly a
very very
interesting time
because i think
i i'm not sure
if i remember
if i actually
said this to
you last time
or whether i
said it to
you in private
on another
occasion but
i really feel
like we're
at we're at
a really really
important point
in terms of
this communication
we're speaking
about yes
communicating ideas
there's something
really quite
important about
this type of
work you know
sharing these
things that we're
doing right now
otherwise i
wouldn't be here
you know i'm
sure you wouldn't
be here either
doing what you're
doing if if you
didn't feel this
this same
almost a duty
to be speaking
at least
that's an
urgency
urgency
literally it's
an emerge
and see
right it's
an emerge
and see
right
emergency
right yes
yes
and yes it
is it does
seem very
urgent and
very there
are many
people who
are they
are dying
inside they're
they're completely
lost you know
and i'm not
entirely i'm
free of that
myself right
i think all of
us are to some
extent um you
know experiencing
the hardships
of the age
that we're
living within
that's for
sure yes
i think many
would be very
would possibly be
foolish to say
they're not but
at the same
time i think it's
a really really
a really incredibly
hopeful time
and a time
where um
some some
incredible new
points of there's
a type of
regeneration that
seems to be taking
place at the
moment um and
and i feel a
new opening
for these
types of
explorations in
a way that i've
never quite seen
to this extent
before no i i
really do i
really feel like
we're we're on
uh without
claiming to be
in any sense uh
you know grandiose or
an expert on these
subjects i just say
very happy to be
part of opening
the conversation
yes i agree and
i don't um i
mean one of the
things that i'm i'm
learning more about
though it's been
clear to me as an
artist for a long
time is that
personal identity is
kind of a trap
right so the the
yes i understand
obviously i have some
concern about
darren and his
life and his
whatever right um
his opportunities and
so forth uh but
it's much more
fascinating the
layers above
darren and
beneath darren
yeah yeah
to travel there
together right
yeah yeah um
you know something
very strange is
going on i made a
recording recently
where i where i
said um i think
the recording's just
called 2024 is not
a year
this like there's
no more of
whatever the hell
was going on
before
has been thrown
up into this
suspended sort
of cloud storm
state and nobody
understands what the
hell is going on
anymore or if they
do it's just because
they're clinging to
the teddy bear of
their previous
suppositions about
the world like
desperately but
yeah it really is
something profound
because on the one
hand there's all
these new
opportunities and on
the other hand
there's this
catastrophic and
agonic you know
dissolution and
pain and death
um so yeah i don't
want to use the
trope from shakespeare
so i'll just suggest
that without saying
it
um okay so there's so
much more and by the
way how are we doing
on time i'm fine but
i want to i'm okay i'm
okay for for time at
the moment as well yeah
i think i'm excited to
continue
um so uh
okay so what happened
that night the frost
you look up
the thing the whole
thing yeah yeah as i
explained
and so what was you
feeling at that moment
what was i feeling uh
as i say just just this
incredible energetic
connectivity
and and uh i felt like i
was touching eternity
quite literally like
touching eternity
and that experience
strangely
i had um
i kind of
discovered how to
switch it back on at
will
oh beautiful
um but this came much
later
but whenever i did switch
it on at will
it reminded me immediately
of that moment once
again you know so
like immediate
recognition
of of that experience
so that what i'm
referring to
is and this
touches on the courses
that i do and things
like this back here in
in england i do them
elsewhere occasionally if
people ask me as well but
um one of the very
important a little bit
about those
yeah yeah so like i i do
um every year i try to
do one maybe two
uh courses in
usually they're advertised
as mesmerism fascination
presence
and i mean this is how you
and i connected
yeah good i think i said on
part part one of this that
it was about
about nine years ago or so
that we actually first
connected but i think it was
more than that it was
actually i think it was more
like 12 actually i started
doing i started doing uh
those courses about 12
years ago now
um
mesmerism fascination and
presence so obviously
the the thing i do
sort of every year is hold
these courses um mesmerism
is a
for those who don't know
is a type of hypnosis it's
an earlier type of hypnosis
more of a non-verbal form of
hypnosis
um
and it was popularized by
france-antan mesmer
hence the term mesmerism
so
pardon when was he active
yeah so this was sort of in
the in the 1700s so mid
1700s
and uh
and it was just prior to the
french revolution actually he
was around just prior to the
french revolution doing a lot
of his work um he was
connected with some quite
interesting people i don't
know if you know this but he
was he had his um a thing
called the glass harmonica which
was a an actual instrument yes i
know about this instrument please
continue
and the and the the classical piece
of music uh moonlight sonata was
written
for this instrument
yeah so what this is is it's a
series of rings glass yeah um it's
like a it's like a plate with a with
a ring around the edge of the plate
tube sort of and these are put on a
spindle and it's a
it's a cone
yes perhaps there are uh either
pedals or keys
pedals yeah pedals and then and
then a little tray of water to dip
your fingertips in that you can
actually rub onto oh wow okay
yeah so the spindle spins and you
get the sound that's like what you
get when you circle a crystal bell or
a glass
precisely precisely yes
profoundly um non-ordinary sound
absolutely it's it's like a
harmonic
it's it's almost like being able to
play an instrument that only
produces harmonics
which themselves are kind of a
magical thing
absolutely and so and so like i say
moonlight sonata was composed with
this instrument in mind
then and then uh benjamin franklin
actually gifted this instrument he had
one made
and gifted it to mesmer oh wow yeah
there's there's one on display in
london actually there's there's a
franklin museum i think in london and
there's a an example of it there
i've never seen one have you seen one
yeah yeah like i say there there's
actually been one uh there's one on
display there in london
well there was some years ago it's
been a long long time since i've seen
it but it was
there was actually a model of it
i don't want to branch but i'm
curious have you ever been in a
place where one is being played
i haven't heard one being played i
have to say no
no but you have heard recordings of
them
oh yes for sure yeah yeah me too i
remember
this and just being blown away and
thinking like i must find a way to
have one of these
when i first heard it yeah well the
thing is is the actual tones
themselves uh mesmer believed that
the tones themselves catapulted the
individuals who heard them because of
the tones actually activated certain
states or trans states in themselves
yeah the tones themselves activated some
of these states so uh so that's
interesting yes i have um a sort of
peculiar personal sensitivity to
anything that produces a non-ordinary
effect
or you know like in in terms of uh
stephen king's book like the shining
yeah there's certain features or facets
of reality
they don't it's not like a visual shine
there's like a spiritual shine to them
they resonate they ring right you you can
tell like oh here's one of the hidden
keys yeah and two very obvious features
of this for me that were apparent in
childhood were spiders and they make
what they're making of webs right just
watch them make what is going on there
there's some that's you could study just
that one thing and it would lead you
everywhere you needed to go right it's
like
a master key to every library hidden in an
organism yes and then similarly another
place where a similar key is hidden a
living key is in the praying mantises
ah yes i've noticed you're particularly
keen on mantises
um but uh let's not branch too far so
what were met what were the precursors
that led mesmer to his discoveries do you
think right okay so when mesmer was um
i think when mesmer's career was just
beginning when he was first he was first
introduced
to the concept of magnetism from a priest i
forget the name of the priest
fair enough
um but he introduced him the concept of
uh magnetism and he utilized actual
magnets
wow uh on different points of the body
uh-huh
uh some esoteric priests have actually
done this and used
use this therapy in in different ways but
of course you and i both know that the
power isn't necessarily in the magnets is
it no great okay please continue yeah so
so mesmer himself um
you know quickly junked the use of the
magnets
and uh
sort of really concentrated more on the
natural ability that we all have
as individuals so he called it animal
magnetism because of the fact that the
animal animal kingdom
uh exhibits this force in in in abundance
but we humans
kind of don't seem to believe we have it
but clearly we do
and certain individuals seem to have had
it in historical epochs perhaps more than
others
and there are famous examples of this
and so you know some people they they
thought of it as charisma or something
like this um which itself you know the
word charisma relates to the golden
anointing
so uh so so this force is something all
individuals have at different levels so
it's a natural ability natural ability i
would suggest that um if you wanted to
see a clear example of it
that's commonly accessible
the gaze of infants
oh yes
right oh yes yes yes
absolutely this i think they're actually
surprised i think the infants can be
surprised when it fails
right right because they know they seem to
know that it works
but yes match gaze with an infant
or a very young child
and you will see directly an example of the
kind of thing i think you're talking about
and i would also suggest
that praying mantises are doing something very
similar right there's a reason why a creature
this big can terrify a grizzly bear
right right and send it screaming for the
woods
you know right right it's not an accident and
it's not just a visual display
yeah yeah
please continue yeah yeah yeah so um so
basically uh where was i going with this
um well you said that certain people were
clearly
more still
animal magnetism the humans don't
necessarily believe they have it but we
do and some
people either have sort of a greater
capacity and or develop it
right yeah so so it's something that
is is there in abundance in the animal
kingdom i was talking about the example of
snakes on the previous part we were doing
you know and and basically it's not just
not just the vision not just the the gaze
that they exert
but it's also everything else it's the
actual awareness of the physicality of
their existence
in this present moment so this is where we
link back to the milky way experience
because the key component is the physical
presence
the key component that empowers all of those
other techniques is the physical moment by
moment awareness of
your existence or of each one of our
existence
so by contacting that we generate
through the conscious awareness of our
physical existence we generate a kind of
a field
and we and we switch it on
so that experience that i had with the
heavens and the earth and me sandwiched or
hit between them
was very much a moment where
the crunching of the feet the stars above my
head
me between the biting of the chill of the air on
what had been a really hot day
yeah
it's like a rod ringing
yes yes and it's it's the origin world
and the physical earth
yes eating and sort of mating and
resonating
yeah yes absolutely absolutely so i was
talking about the alchemical components of
this
and uh of course the actual earth that i was
walking upon at that particular point in
the path was pure peat
jet black peat
so the moorlands
have the blackest peat i've ever seen in my
life
and like i say even at certain other points
like the pennine ridge
you'd be walking on the peat
on that particular part of the walk you'd be
walking upon the peat
and the black soil of the peat which the
egyptians used to call chem by the way
so chem k-h-e-m so the black comes from
which kemet comes from
so it was the actual residue cast up from
the nile over and over again would would
bring all of this fertile peat onto the
surface or the silt
so that would be the thing that would give
the fertility and bring the fertility to
the land
and of course the like almost like a
menstrual
exudate of the river
yes yes yes yes yes exactly this exactly
there exactly this
so you have the nile delta
with this
you say you know with this exudate coming
out and fertilizing all of the land around
it oh my god we're starting to get all egyptian
again here
yeah
about this fragmentation
and of course the fragmentation and the whole art of healing
is to bring back together that which is scattered
so the body of osiris of course represents like all the shamanic myths you know the body is scattered
to the four winds so to speak and isis was the one that
got the separation from the land turned herself into the hawk
looked down upon the land and discovered the fragments scattered across the land and brought
them back together again to actually make the first mummy which was the resurrection of osiris
from the world of the dead
it strikes me that the eye of toth is actually related to the eye of the kestrel
right little hawk the desert right which you can't really see it but this uh
this image is an image a very complex magical image of kestrel
inside the frame behind you yes yes um
it also implies rising above the human or even the temporal
right into the what might uh what uh almond hillman calls the aonic life right right right
the life outside of time is not just outside of location in space it's outside of location in time
and from there you can find all the pieces yeah so to speak and again now here again we have this
concept of the bridge being absolutely right the bridge being who becomes sort of a linchpin
above all of these fragments linking them together and then perhaps drawing them back down into
a being a situation a place the healing please continue well the exactly one of my big questions today
um was basically okay so what is healing anyway in its truest sense you know we we can have some fairly
simple examples like oh you know you want to heal um bad eyesight you want to heal um i don't know a
throat condition or something like that we've got these small examples of healing but of course the the
healing we're we're speaking of really when we're speaking of sacred healing is we're talking about like
it's an overused term but you know making something bringing the holism bringing the the bringing
something back to a sense of holiness there is also a feature of anamnesis
you're right yes forgetting which you know uh not everyone knows this but the word lethal
that comes from the river lefe right between our lives and there's there's a bunch of sort of
narratological arcs around why we here on earth forget our previous uh incarnations or uh perhaps
uh embodiments um so yes there's an unforgetting aspect because it's weird you know it's almost as if
in some of us in some features of our lives we specifically bury some part of us
that is fragmented by a situation and then we enact a drama uh personally a personal drama
i have done this right it's embarrassing but i i know i'm aware of it we humans are sometimes
embarrassing it's true so i will enact a drama about the part of myself that i
dissociated from and and hid from and the drama is very mythic right yeah yeah often uh in transactional
analysis there's a concept of life scripts yeah right which which are coping mechanisms often uh established
in childhood that are useful sort of fairy tale ish right but when they are not conscious in our adult
lives when when they're no longer really necessary and we have the capacity to negotiate and work with
what's actually going on it's it's helpful for us to make conscious this life script this mythic story
that we've been playing out and um perhaps rewrite it right yeah and and and the the thing is of course
you know if if we go into the much much bigger wider wider picture you know um i mean i've i've said and
this leads on to a lot of the things i was going to say about the the hill that i was talking about
it all points to and leads to many uh details which confirmed for me in various ways the threads the
connective threads to actually weave me back to my previous incarnations so to speak oh wow and and this
is where this becomes really important and this is where i gain this peace and faith for want of a better word um
of this
process that whenever i receive any of these pieces whenever i receive any of these fragments
i don't worry about chasing them because i know i absolutely know that all i have to do is wait
because there's going to be a time where like i said with the the individual that i met over a
coffee table who told me the name i knew with certainty i wasn't even looking for it i knew with certainty
that this was the name and i knew at that moment that all i have to do is call on that name
and i didn't chase it
and all these little fragments that i've parked on the shelf and just book note to them bookmarked them
put them on the shelf and waited what it is is it's all the fragments
that i know that i it as long as i keep myself open to all of these possibilities that or everything
that is that belongs to my trajectory my journey through time and eternity
is all going to come to me i i don't think the purpose of our of our current incarnation
is necessarily to to chase after all of these missing fragments
but they play a really important part and they will come to us anyway so sometimes i might wake up
and be woken up by a repeat i will be repeating to myself a specific set of words or a specific word
and sometimes it's not even it's in a language i don't even know what it is
the important thing is is that i remember it i write it down and it sticks with me the other
important thing about these things is because they're explained later and sometimes that each
one of these phrases and words are like a key that opens up a whole insight into another area
but sometimes it it takes five seven years before i get the next part
so i'm just i'm just sharing with you how for me these these things work
these little these little fragments which seem to belong to a
i'm sort of lost for words but like a kind of fragmenting fragments of like a weaving tapestry
that belongs to many other incarnations that have existed from times before so there's a um
there's a what a figure that perhaps might be useful or helpful here yeah i call it the starry blanket
and one can imagine that over time many lives
they are sewing in a sense in the sense of like needlework they're sewing a sort of a celestial blanket
with acts of beauty and intelligence and courage and rescue and healing and that our souls are actually
drawn from stars in this blanket many of them right so their soul isn't one thing it's like a set of
connections between historical beings and places and moments and such and then as we live we are adding to
this blanket right and it might seem fragmentary from down here where this there's this star and that
star and the moon and that planet and so forth but from up there it's not fragmentary right no no it's
fragmentary because of our relationship with linear time i think primarily that's right that's right
absolutely right uh yeah because of our relationship with linear time but this is the thing that that you
doubt this is yes yes you learn to doubt right and that's why you do you're not concerned with
urgencies when you find the fragment you place it on the shelf you know linear time is an illusion
that's it so over you'll you will traverse the illusion of linear time and the integration will
naturally that's it that's it i couldn't i couldn't have put it better myself so
but you've put into words what i kind of viscerally feel because it is a feeling you know it's it's a
feeling that that there is no need to uh you know there is no need to to to be too concerned about it
although like we said earlier there is a certain there is a feeling of of a sense of urgency right now
in in some of the things we're discussing and communicating and sharing
uh i understand your point of view on that um but for for me personally in relation to these experiences
um it comes across to me personally in in very much a way where it's like right okay okay i'm just
getting another little little bit of confirmation of my want of a better word
yeah i mean uh connection is not essentially it's more your um identity as in eternity yeah yeah like
you and eternity are the same thing even though there's the milky way and there's lee it's true
for all of us yes yes it is but you and it's so profound because um when like in our conversation
now you have two disparate sort of wanderers right and they both had these long paths but when they come
together there's this profound uh conversation um
which is a kind of a musical composition the language the spoken language of which is in a sense
the least important thing even though it's the uh it's it's the the glass harmonica of our souls
yeah sort of resonating back and forth yes yes um i want to return something you were speaking about
earlier unless there's something urgently in that you need to share right now no no please please go
ahead okay so what is the gaze um yeah we've been taught and i'm sure you'll you'll have some things to
add here but i want to introduce this topic we've been taught that that what we see is passive right
that our eyes are receptors for light that all that's happening in vision is that we receive the
reflected light of things around us and the brain organizes that into a uh a sort of a picture
in consciousness right it flips it over on the back of the retina we know
we have the scientific explanation of the mechanics of of human vision um but for most of human history
none of that was what was being understood the greeks were absolutely aware uh and i can't explain the
complexities of their awareness and understanding of this fact but that that the eyes project
it's participatory just as in just as when you speak my ear rings and i hear something very similar
is happening with vision it is kind of a a speaking of energies into the world which then
harass and touch in their various intentional ways the flower or the cloud or the bog and then this returns
the the the the sort of resonance of how we reached out to touch and the purposes for which we reached
out to touch affect the world and this effect returns to us as vision now yes yes say one more
thing before i i hand this over to you because i'm desperately curious about what you think about these
things um i've had the experience of waking up in my bed looking around my room seeing how things are
laid out my girlfriend next to me on the bed the shape of her hair on the pillow and so forth
and then realizing that my eyes are closed yeah yeah and opening my eyes and having nothing effectively
change except a feature of the feeling of the origin of the seeing yes yes so it's very clear to me that
it is possible to see without eyes yes now i'll hand this over to you and whatever yeah i'd love to
yes yes well if if we refer back to part one of the conversation we had last time we were talking
about the sun you know and we were talking about where is the sun you know we can point to it in the
sky and all of this sort of stuff and yeah there's the sun and the rest of it but like we were talking
about seeing the sun in the in dreams feeling the sun upon your skin in dreams and so on uh and where
is the sun in a dream you know it's like where is it where is the sun you actually see where is it
you know where is it the whole also the whole notion of uh the heliocentric theory and the geocentric
theory um you know is the earth in the center does one go around the other or is it the other going
around the other well yes both are true and so we're back to that uh old quandary again and what
you've just been describing is i'll bring your attention to a very strong symbol that many may be
aware of or may have seen and that's the image of um some of the images of akhenaten so you have uh that
famous image of akhenaten sometimes with the art and itself the sun his version of ra or the the solar
god the artan with its various rays with hands on the end each ray has has got a hand oh yes yes yes
the sun and then the rays the rays with ray has like a hand hand on the end yeah it's sort of like
like this or something right if i remember correctly yeah that's right so it's it's a splayed it's a sun
with the display of of different rays and each ray has got a hand on the end of each ray um and sometimes
you see i've seen images uh of akhenaten and nefertiti with rays coming literally coming out of their eyes
like similar you know like rays jutting out of their eyes so
this touches on a lot of the things you're speaking about uh in in regards to
there is the manifest and does the manifestation come from within out is it that
light which go reaches out into space only forms images when it has something you know when it has
something to bounce off in the same way as the sun sends out rays to say for example the moon and the
moon gives the reflection of the light um everything we see from the old perspective you were mentioning the
greeks but also the egyptians there was this notion that everything that we can see everything that
was was projected from within out so to speak you have an image here yes that's it of nefertiti and
akhenaten and uh the yeah so you have the the arton with all of the rays coming out and you can't see it too
well but on the ends of those rays you have uh each one of the rays has got a hand on the end
yeah and she's got a child in her lap that's right yeah that's right very peculiar yes very profound
um absolutely these things okay so i didn't mean to interrupt so so with with the gaze itself
all of these things you're talking about come into play the gaze is not a uh if if the one who is
practicing can truly step inside this this way that you've just described this particular perspective
for want of a better word if you if if the practitioner can step inside that
and then experience that then there is the opportunity for that to take place
oh there's so much here um the recipient would be the passive one
yes but it's also resembles the relation where uh okay this is just something that's occurring to me
if the practitioner becomes the point of origin not the sun as hypostasis but the origin of why there
is a sun right right and then the the um the patient so to speak becomes sort of like the earth
or something illumined or the moon yes exactly precisely uh illumined by that and so this ancient
originary role uh uh not not a play but a role embodiment yeah occurs sort of naturally
and in a way magnetically yes yes because of the ancientness of these roles yes please continue
well yes i mean i mean what you were saying about uh you know one being literally like a sun the other
being like a moon you're you're you literally create that polarity between the practitioner and this and the subject
there has to be that polarity created and it has to be something which is done in a very i i keep using the
word in a very visceral manner so when an animal is exuding this force uh like a snake for example
um or a lion or something like this or some other beast it's actually um it's it's actually doing it
usually with the intention of it being almost like it's going to catch its prey so to speak it has to find
a way to in a sense i'm trying i'm not very very good at finding words today but in a sense it literally
the plummets that uh that the recipient into a complete trance just for a moment often and it's
that uh that state that the recipient falls into that the hunter so to speak uses to its advantage
okay i want to say a few things here briefly so um in nature those of us who are sensitive to
sentience consciousness awareness intelligence particularly
yeah we'll see different forms of intelligences embodied in nature for example right in the eyes
of cow it's not the same as looking in the eyes of a raccoon or it's not the same as looking in the eye
of a praying mantis it's not the same as looking in the eye of a cat a snake's eye is a very particular
thing but one of the best examples of what you're talking about is utilized because it's it's really
obviously a human can easily see it on film is what a cuttlefish does when it is hypnotizing shrimp
i see pulses of colorful light traversing the skin of the cuttlefish in an increasing frequency and you
see the shrimp actually start to just sort of float off and then you know and then it grabs it right
and for the praying mantis what it does is this kind of thing um it will weave slowly
that's it and then very rapidly and then strike that's it just like a snake it's very similar in
there are forms of martial art that are not dissimilar that's right in martial art the goal is to
hide the um it's to hide the build-up right you don't want the build-up to be seen uh so that so
the build-up becomes internal right like you say visceral please continue yeah this is right and uh
when when the individual is practicing with fascination techniques the gaze techniques um it's very subtle
so this is something obviously if i was working with someone directly and teaching them teaching
them exactly how to do this there is a certain way to do it and so often you have to demonstrate
it on the person you're trying to teach of course you know you have to demonstrate it directly to them
so that they actually grasp what it is you're actually doing once they've been on the sort of recipient
end of it then it's my job to actually get that individual to replicate that effectively so i would
then coach that individual in into how to actually replicate that properly um and and teach them all
the little tips on what to look for precisely what to look for to know that it's being done properly and
that's that's the important thing is is teaching them exactly what to look for because there are
certain certain signs um that it's being done properly unmistakable you might say uh-huh it's um
it's different from hypnosis but there are signs also in the client in hypnosis yes yeah this is very
true often you can see the pulse in someone's neck you can see it slow you can see the relaxation of
the facial muscles you can detect the the shoulders may drop slightly the breathing changes these are
hard to see over a camera but when you're in person with someone they're relatively easy to see i'm sure
um there are different signs for the mesmeric for the success of mesmerism but there's another
principle i want to speak briefly about here and before i continue i just want to say
i think that sometimes when people are listening to me speaking
they may have the impression that i'm reading from the book of what i already know
uh right because this is what it is common for us to think when people speak
they that they are saying things they already know they have known before and in our conversation
much of what is taking place is not that it is something very strange is happening where
my awareness it feels like is touching a non-verbal mirror in you right then i am able to somehow
coalesce it's like the thing we were talking about with seeing i can yes or less the reflection
and then i can begin to articulate what i am feeling or seeing which is not something i have known before
or articulated before right before so this is what is so beautiful and exciting part of what is so
beautiful or exciting for me as well as the anam noetic uh reweaving of histories and and potentials and seeing
the thing i wanted to mention is that um again my friend ryan first diver who you know certainly
doesn't consider himself a magician but the path of a blackfoot ceremonial person is involved with
uh something they don't have the concept for magic there's lots of words in english they don't even have
a concept for it and their treatment of identity is so different from ours that the idea of concrete
identity basically doesn't exist so you see a person it's not necessarily that person right they don't
just presume oh it's that person because you could be coming from the sun or you could be coming from the
land or you could be coming from another tribe so your identity is in how you relate rather than in
your visage and you know your name badge or whatever as it is in the west right we just see joe we think
oh that's joe you know i was taught to not think that way uh and during my experience i was taught to
very carefully participatorially establish our identities together rather than presume them
but um there's two principles that i think are relevant perhaps to hypnosis and maybe mesmerism and
one is similitude the resemblance right resembling uh when you say like i get them to uh emulate
me right that's the similitude principle right well there is it can never be truly emulated because it's
such an infinitely um variable and minuscule actual thing that takes place but yes
you're on the right track and it's definitely there is definitely a similitude and
and there is something it's something you can replicate yeah it's not emulation that leads to
success it's emulation that gives that maybe communicates the form and then the form has to be
embodied it's yes i think that that is successful or not um but then the other uh principle which i think is
quite trippy is contagion well i was going to actually use the word transmission actually
fair enough because because there's the there's the the principle of transmission
is something that's very real when you're working with uh the type of thing that i'm talking about
because it's it's something which is uh which is coursing through you and it's it's almost
connecting to a field of uh connecting to a field of information that exists out there beyond us so if
it's coming through me and i know how to actually and i successfully or you know enable this to be
transmitted to the individual that i'm working with then it's by the very nature of this energetic field
starting to connect one will connect to that continuum which links through all of my own experiences
somehow and it actually is transmitted to the individual who who i'm working with yes so
when you say this continuum so to speak yeah it's almost as if um not just your history
but the lineages that feed in your history yes go into the other person and as a seed sort of and
begin to light up and expand and i'm not trying to couch our discussion in terms of um concepts from
for example traditional blackfoot ceremony but crucially in uh their way of life they have this
uh concept that uh is more primordial than the other two that i was just using which are similitude
and contagion and obviously those are english words it's transfer right you be um you know in english we
might call it initiation but it's much more intimate than this it's literally both
uh something being placed into you and also you being drawn into a lineage history
that you now become a fit a family member of so to speak yeah so so uh we can bring this analogy to
say for example um when somebody is uh in in in certain types of tradition where you have say for
example the laying on of hands as an actual transmission uh it's similar to this there is
something that is transmitted through time from lots of different individuals who have existed physically
but maybe don't exist physically anymore however they're present in you at the moment that you
transmit to the next person yes you in the future when you're no longer this incarnate in the normal sense
will be transmitted through your you know the connection you had you you have added to that
continuum of energy amplified it in some measure and then and then that's all added to what's passed
down to the to the future generations yes there is a type of transmission that that would speaking of
here and initiation as you say uh it's all these are all relevant terms maybe not always satisfactorial
satisfactory words but you know i think the concepts are easily understood i just want to share a couple
of other things briefly yeah when i began to study tai chi i studied it before with it with a teacher
and then i lost my form and there's a whole adventure behind that but i've i found these uh
five older men who were practicing every morning and they began to teach me yeah and i was very passionate
about this right and pretty soon within about three months about three months in i started having dreams
i had three or four of them in which a group of older asian men would come and they would just straight
up tell me you know we've heard that you know we've heard about you and we're here to check you out
yeah i want to see like who are you you know what are you for real you you know are you the kind of
person we would want to join the family you know this kind of thing and thankfully in those cases uh it
worked out well um for me but there was a similar thing that happened when i experienced a transfer
from blackfoot culture where and it was much more profound and like primordial and there were there
were like hundreds of men warriors and and um uh ceremonial elders and stuff that came there was this
quest there were all these amazing features um that were nothing like a regular dream right yes
very obviously um uh something's going on here so i just i just wanted to share that because it might
help people to understand what is meant by joining a lineage or being introduced or having a transmission
right it really is to become a part of a of a of a lineage and a family um and to be checked out
right to be sort of you know tested like are you are you for real you want to sell this what do you
want you know actually often there's a question when you meet uh a non-ordinary being or intelligence
they may praise you right they'll sort of they may sort of build you up and say oh yeah you're
really cool we like you blah blah blah and so we're going to give you a gift and what do you want
okay i'm sorry because they're they're really trying to figure out are you um are you selfish
yeah right right are you selfish is really kind of the question and by the way that question leads
to a ladder of other questions yes half the first question right i think but yes please continue
and how how are we doing how are we doing on time how are you
um i think i can do maybe maybe about another 10 minutes or something like that more or less
uh on this occasion um so i'm just trying to work out where where we were because
so really um
to me all i'm trying to find a way to sort of conclude it uh on this on this occasion so
yeah i mean we can have we could hopefully we'll have further exploration yeah well well you know
like i say uh when when i've got the ability to make it coincide with everything i've got going on
here i'm very very happy to do that that's a mile yes yeah great so so um to sort of try and pull this
together at the moment it's more a thing of like you know where is all of this going you know what
what is um all of this giving to us you know it's it seems as if there is a there is a question hanging
um we experience these things uh i'm sure there are many many many others uh similar to ourselves
who've been having these experiences and it's been feeding into the work that we're doing and uh reflecting
itself back in the work that we're doing um certainly we can we can very likely even identify
what we believe our roles and our duty is in this incarnation with regards to how we pass this
on to people and what you what utility it has as well you know for the benefit of others
um but there is a big question which is hanging there all the time and that that is
where is this all ultimately leading to you know this is this is the question for me
or at least the question which i'm going to leave hanging in the air perhaps
now of course it would probably be foolish for us to to conclusively answer anything of the kind
and i think we've touched on that previously you know sometimes there's no point in you know it's
it's not right to kill the to kill that question yes um but it's uh it's it's certainly something which is
worth putting out there even if it's for our own personal um work in our conversations so far
we have rung we have sounded bells along a trajectory right and those those ringing notes
they naturally coalesce over time yes right in the same way that you were speaking about
the recovered fragments and how it's not you allow them to be
sort of uh preserved without constant attention and inquiry yeah exactly yes um and and also the concept
of suggestion and indirect communication is very profound so for me our conversation sounds these
notes that ring in the between of our conversations and i'm sure will ring in the audience
in a very that's my heart yes that's very very generative and fertilizing way like that
like the peat like like the menstruational you know uh intensity of the blue sky and the sonic purple
yeah the red purple yeah i have uh so much faith in you and your way and your path you as a being who
who has um a noble purpose you know you you have great charisma but you're not like a personality
you know in the way of someone who's uh self-aggrandizing right and so i'm i'm just so
grateful for this opportunity to learn and and see with you every time we may have it yeah and and darian
uh similarly with with yourself you know um you the way you the way you lay things out in terms of
how your your own summaries and descriptions are incredibly incredibly illuminating on the spot you
know for me it's not even like i'm sure i'll maybe if i listen to this interview in the future i'll have
further revelations but in the midst of actually being here talking about these things
there's been a great deal of actual living you know things kick-starting like coming to life
in my own understanding right there on the spot as as we saw earlier today um and that in itself you
know is is it's incredibly inspiring and uh there's something about the way that you're um presenting these
things to me or or reflecting them back to me in some instances which is incredibly illuminating for
me so it's it's there's something very fruitful about the way i feel where we're interacting on these
matters it's um profoundly the same for me it's almost as if uh the light of my history and awareness
and the light of your history and awareness they meet somewhere and then there's there's like there's like
a group of figures who speak back to us from the the the intersection right it's so beautiful and i'm
i'm just so grateful and humbled uh i can't wait to me too and and i'm also curiously aware of the fact that
there is something i i feel there is something in in your own experiences and background and in
and in mind that somehow relates to something beyond us which we've not quite yet been able to quite
fathom or grasp but there's a it feels like there's a reason why this connection came together so just
oh absolutely it's so healing for me yeah inspiring um and it's so insightful i've seen i've learned so
much i mean it sounds like i'm talking and blah blah i get it but i've learned so much um every
time we come together and it really is humbling because it's not like uh oh what is it's not like
it's about what darren knows or anything like that something very um magical uh sort of mysterious and
alive and i i just want to honor that and and you and your work i'm so grateful and i can't wait for the
next time yeah well well um hopefully when you're when you're over here uh in the uk i mean i'm you
know we i don't think we can miss the chance to try to you know to pull that together uh to meet up
and um and do something uh go to some of these sacred sites um have a look around i just want to extend
the invitation you ever want to come here you've got a spot you know i don't know have you ever been to
california i've never been well actually i think when i was 10 years old i did but that was when i
was 10 years old i it was actually florida not california no yeah sorry yeah it's like well we'll
talk about this offline but um i'm there and uh yeah i'm just so excited and thank you so much lee
it's brilliant to have a chance to speak with you and learn together so absolutely until our next
adventure absolutely yes yes may your path be blessed and beautiful yours too sir
bye-bye for now bye-bye
