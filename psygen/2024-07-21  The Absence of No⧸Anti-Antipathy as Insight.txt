Hello, everybody. Welcome. It's a lustry Saturday here in San Francisco. I'm out for a walk, as I often am.
I'm enjoying the outside of the box that nature comprises. I remember when I first came here, I thought about the park.
Well, that's not really nature. The humans made that stuff. It used to all be sand dunes. It's like your backyard garden. It's artificial.
I lifted my nose in the general direction of Golden Gate Park and snubbed it a little bit.
But then I saw the majesty of the cypresses and the pines.
And then eventually, being a bit of an organic druid, born that way rather than trained,
I had experiences that affirmed in me the sense that wherever the living beings are, there you will find nature.
And, you know, some of us become conservators of the spirit of the living places and we carry that spirit into representational culture,
into cities, into the places where the humans, having been tragically deprived of their origins and faculties and ways of being,
to practice fictions that resemble what they lost but cannot return it to their experience.
And so, it's an experience that resembles eating food that doesn't satiate your body's need for nourishment or drinking.
Try to imagine drinking something that just makes you thirstier every time you drink it.
Of course, we have experiences of some such things. We call them addictions.
They may temporarily satiate a need or perhaps they occlude an impoverishment or hunger briefly.
Thus, soothing or calming us.
But then with each iteration of the use of the substance, along with the occlusion of the impoverishment it covers over,
comes the inception of the temporal recursion of the need for the substance, right?
You don't necessarily want a cigarette right after smoking one.
But within 15 to 30, 40 minutes, if you're well addicted, you will. Again.
And the longer that you wait, the more insistent that desire will become.
For many of us, once addicted.
It's not a law. It's a principle.
But some of us carry the spirit of the living places.
And similarly, we carry the spirit of origin,
which is ordinarily associated with religion or the divine.
We carry that into the cities and essentially the graveyards of our souls,
our meaningful relationships, our identities.
It's not surprising that couples have difficulty remaining together in contexts that are nearly entirely counterfeited
and forgeries of what would otherwise be natural to us humans,
which is mutual concern, rescue, healing, mutually rewarding endeavors, play, creativity, divination, oracular sensing, rejuvenation, revitalization, celebration.
These are the things. These are the branches on the real, the authentic tree of our humanity.
I was reading something so ridiculous.
I think it was by a guy named Bill Connors. I'm not sure.
I would like to name him just because what he, what I saw was so absurd.
And perhaps, you know, perhaps it's not Bill's fault.
Perhaps someone's quoting him.
But in order to have quoted him, he must have somewhere presented publicly the idea.
And what he was doing was, by the way, what I'm doing right here is almost as ironic because I'm defaming someone,
which is a misuse of my virtues and a misuse of my capacity for speech.
Nonetheless, it can be exemplary to demonstrate such misuse, particularly if it's engaged in consciously.
There's weird ways that irony can be inverted, and this is one of them, to consciously demonstrate a misuse of one of our faculties might, in fact, invert it.
In any case, Bill was railing against what he called performative charity.
There were like, you know, twelve paragraphs of Bill railing against performative charity, saying, you know, don't do this.
You know, if you're going to be charitable, be charitable in secret.
Which is a reasonably virtuous concept.
The problem is that once you start railing against performative charity in public, you're exemplifying performative virtue.
And once you have the concern about performativeness, you can see how quickly and easily this becomes very ironic.
Because you're simply talking about the difference between consciously engaging in virtue and unconsciously engaging in virtue.
And Bill is saying that real virtue is unconscious.
Well, is it really, Bill? Is that really true?
Because that would mean that every desire to have ever written a book or perform a public piece of music,
that would mean that the entire scope of performative humanity is somehow wrong.
Is that true? Does that sound right to you? Think about it.
Now, there are certainly performances we'd be better off without.
And there's some kinds of fakery and forgery that we would certainly be better off without.
But does that mean that the entire domain of the emulation of virtue or skill in public is bad?
No, I can't imagine it could be.
In fact, humans being unimaginably sensitive to observation will naturally learn a broad array of display behaviors.
And in fact, asking for aid from another being, calling out for help in a crisis.
These are display behaviors.
Shall we indict them for their possible performative nature?
Well, what is meant by performative here?
I suppose that the fundamental sense is action engaged in specifically to receive the acclaim, praise, or rewards.
Right?
It means fake virtue, fake goodness of the kind that we regularly see rising to the top of the froth on the internet.
As what we refer to generally.
There are exceptions here.
I don't want to categorize everyone.
But as influencers.
And to some degree, what we could call digital creators.
Even though I myself fall into that category.
Certainly not an influencer.
Not yet.
So what we mean are people who are fishing for attention, essentially.
Right?
And we all do that to some degree, I think.
In ways unique to each of us and our situations.
If we didn't fish for attention, we might never get any.
If, you know, unless we are members of a community that is active and vital, alive.
And, you know, in common, mutual flesh presence.
Right?
Meat presence.
Together.
We see each other's faces.
We hear each other's voices.
Not digital representations of them.
We smell each other's bodies and hair and breath.
And we, uh, we are animals together.
So I thought Bill's, you know, twelve paragraph tirade against performative charity was profoundly ironic.
And, you know, this is the problem with the whole complex, well, the whole, most of the complex that surrounds wokeness.
Quote, unquote.
Yes, of course, we should be educated about each other's uniqueness.
About each other's historical and present day suffering.
About injustice.
But let's, let's take that in a direction that brings us together.
Because if we take it in a direction that's primed for indictment.
And judgment.
And cancellation and so forth.
So we're not, we're not, we're not to speak of certain matters.
We not belonging to certain groups shall be, shall remain, uh, our concerns, perspectives, knowledge, history, opinions, desires, and so forth, shall remain unheard.
Shall be silenced.
So, for example, as a man I have nothing to say about women.
Because I don't have a womb.
Well, I was a womb.
A womb is where I came from.
So, something is wrong with the idea, uh, that as a man I have nothing to contribute to the conversation.
And those of you who know me, personally, and have had, you know, conversations with me on these topics, are well aware that I have insights about the nature of being a woman, female.
Female.
That are extremely uncommon, even among women.
And some of which are profound.
Similarly, women, who have carefully observed and been fascinated by men, are naturally, will naturally have insights about us that I would not want silenced because they don't have testicles.
But, um, the complex of wokeness is filled with a contagious potential for indictment.
And, to the degree that we expend our vitality and energy and interest there, it will be lost in forward progressive momentum.
And, um, prison earring is a shitty investment of human potential.
Punishing the past?
Dumb idea.
Mostly.
With very few exceptions.
In my view.
And, by all means, correct me.
You know, if you've got what it takes, step up, we'll have a, we'll have a chat.
But, what I'm actually here to talk about today is a tangential but related topic.
In a recent conversation with a close friend who, at three years old, asked her mother, what does nothing look like?
And her mother first said, it's blackness.
Which, yeah, I can see all the problems that arise from what I've just said in the minds of those who would transfer the topic to ethnicity, for example.
Um, she protested, no, no, that's something.
Blackness is something.
And then her mother said, well, it's, it's whiteness.
And she protested again, no, no, that's something.
What does nothing, what is the appearance of nothing?
She didn't use the word appearance, she said, what does it look like?
And her mother said, I don't know.
Now that answer is quite profound.
But as we were speaking, and I've had this conversation with her a few times,
and our minds are quickened by each other's locality in a way that usually leads to inspiration and discovery and wonder and play and all of the beautiful features
that enliven, revitalize and give birth to our intelligences.
And I said, perhaps the likeness of nothing is no likeness whatsoever.
Perhaps it is the absence of a likeness that allows the possibility of consciousness at all, of awareness at all.
Right?
Right?
What if what it looks like, what if what nothing looks like is, quote, not looking, unquote.
Right?
Because, think about a mirror.
Its entire capacity depends upon the absence of pre-existing figures in it.
Right?
And what if thought, awareness and intelligence are similar?
They are unique modal expressions, modal exemplars of the possibilities, the urgencies, the gravities of non-containment.
Right?
Of non-likeness.
When we watch, we listen to music or we watch a film or a show, right?
It begins with us not being the musicians, not being the actors, not being the story.
Right?
It all starts with not-ness.
And this is very astonishing because we rarely consider this.
When we think about consciousness we think it's something.
But what if it is an array of potentials that arise from the absencing of many potential, many features, many characteristics, one of which is unity.
Right?
Because if everything is truly all one, then there is no difference, there appears to be no differentiating characteristics to anything because all characteristics belong to one, indissoluble.
I mean, you hear noises like this in the Pledge of Allegiance and stuff in America.
One nation under God.
One.
Right?
Oneness.
Oneness.
So, something very profound here about non-likeness and my brilliant friend, who I love.
She was making these doublest, these sort of double negations, like, that resemble something like,
um, to see what seeing is, you must not see the unseen, all of the unseen things that comprise the context of which seeing becomes the possibility of the fulfillment,
the unique fulfillment of. It's very difficult to rephrase what she said, because her unique skill with complex layered negations,
which I would argue is a fundamentally feminine skill, perhaps the first words of my sister and I are indicative of something profound about being men and women.
And mine were, I go. A woman could certainly have the same phrase as her first phrase, but my sisters were, no.
It's that simple. Nope. And negation turns out to be absolutely imperatively fundamental to any kind of affirmation or positive statement, including the possibility of vision.
Light requires darkness. Vision requires blindness. Speech requires muteness, silence.
So, to music. Dance emerges from stillness. Think about John Cage in terms of music, the silent artist, artist who illustrated the profundity of silence and its relationship to music.
Like, you know, I don't remember the exact number, but I think he had a piece that was called something like 33 and a third.
And there was a grand piano on the stage, came out and sat at it for 33 and a third minutes, did nothing.
Now imagine what was going on in the audience, because it was definitely creating an effect, right?
It just wasn't, it just wasn't, it was the total defiance of the expectation of music that became itself a kind of a meta music, right?
A meta musical thing.
How profound this must have been for the first experiencers of it, and if they did not know what to expect for any sequential experiencers.
So when I say that negation is a primordial power of the feminine, we should pay close attention, right?
It's fundamental.
My friend also said, think about what happens when you begin a poem with O.
And I thought, does she mean the letter O?
Does she mean the word O-H?
Does she mean the word O, which can be different from the letter O?
And she said, you know, think of how that just is an invocation of almost absolute vulnerability.
And it blew me away to consider that, for I too, as a young poet, occasionally,
there's probably going to be some wind noise here, which is ironic and beautiful.
But I too occasionally was so deranged and or bold and or experimental as to just begin a poem with the letter O.
As a kind of a, as an exclamatory invitation.
Oh, how I saw, you know.
Oh, how I felt the first shards of dawn penetrating through the curtains of my soul in the morning.
Oh, and then I spoke of the vulnerability of encompassment to encompass, right?
Vaginally to encompass.
But not just vaginally, with the intelligence, with awareness, with consciousness,
with relationship to encompass, right?
To contain.
Oh, there's a problem?
Well, I shall contain the problem, right?
Which, in fact, the history of human reproduction and sexuality probably has a lot to do with the containment of a problem.
And what is the problem?
It's rigidity, right?
It's concreteness.
It's insistent, rhythmic penetration and so forth.
Yes, encompassment.
But not just to encompass a problem, right?
Like, the child isn't a problem.
When encompassed by our loving embrace, the child is, we are both nurtured.
We are both revitalized, remembered to our origins.
We are, you know, there's embracing.
There's not just the more or less seemingly or superficially seeming explicit concept of sex,
which I would argue that humans are wildly confused about, generally speaking, in the moderns.
Perhaps more than any people in the history of our species.
Because we have made, we grow up in a situation where sexuality is a product, a commodity.
And it's often rendered very explicitly to us, particularly in the catastrophically tragic and unfortunate existence of what we refer to as pornography.
And some will say, oh, there was pornography long ago.
But, yeah, no, there wasn't, actually.
There's nothing like the possibility of the hell-making nightmare that is pornography today.
Vicious, tyrannical, horrifying.
Eros and porn are not the same thing.
So, our conversation continued, and she spoke about her desire as the absence of negation, which is very trippy.
Basically, what she said was that what guides her desire isn't the presence of desire, it's the absence of antipathy.
All right?
And that's just brilliant.
It's probably very common in all kinds of people, all kinds of people, but particularly women.
The absence of antipathy must be quite rare.
Especially because, you know, if you have constant approaches by idiotic males, or even by sophisticated males, or you have males mimicking sophistication, and so forth.
So, yeah, the absence of antipathy, what she called the absence of no, is amazingly profound, and could be a really useful guide to being human.
All right?
Just follow the absence of no.
Because, you know, then we spoke of the daimons, right?
And Socrates' daimon, which is storied to have never said any positive thing, but only told Socrates what not to do, when something was wrong or should not be done, or something wrong had been done.
And spoke rarely, and only when Socrates was in a kind of a fugue state, he was epileptic.
He had a specific kind of epilepsy, we think.
So, yes, these things are extremely important.
Someone just walked by with a phone on their arm, and the name of the person they were talking to was displayed on the phone, which I thought was kind of unsubtle.
So, yes, the still small voice, right, which a few times in my life has just said, no.
And often this is the only thing it will say, no.
At one time I was about to change lanes, and it was just, don't.
And it was like someone who wasn't me spoke in my ear, and I looked, and again, I had checked carefully.
I had turned my head over my right shoulder, as my father taught me, before changing lanes to my right.
There was nothing there, there was nothing in my rear view.
I turned again after hearing, stop, is what it actually said, I think.
And there was a car in my blind spot that I would have veered right into, had I not heeded that.
There was another time when it advised me not to kiss a girl who was with me, and I ignored that to my grave peril.
And to staggering future consequence.
So, the absence of no is the absence of the advisor's negations, right, the sort of soul voices negations, and that's a very profound thing.
So, we might think of it as the opposite of true north on the compass, by which north becomes meaningful, right?
Because without that opposite of north, what is the use of knowing north?
It doesn't help you.
You know, if north is in any old direction, again, it doesn't help you.
I'm watching people walk their dogs, the intrepidness of the dog in a world of humans.
It would be like, imagine that, I mean, just take the concept and translate it to,
you're a leashed human on a world of aliens that are vastly more advanced than humans.
And you adore them, and they adore you, but you come from a completely other world than theirs, right?
Yeah, the intrepidness, the angelic nature of the dogs.
Which, by the way, are mostly, dogs are mostly about yes, right?
I always say yes to any, get excited, pretend to be excited, the dog becomes very excited, right?
Just look excited, the dog doesn't care, why are you excited?
They're just happy, oh, you're excited?
I'm excited too, let's be excited together, right?
Try that with the cat, see how that works, you know?
The cat, I mean, think about that, try that with the cat sometimes, get really excited,
see what happens with the cat.
The cat will look at you like you're broken in the mind, right?
It'll just look at you like, what the fuck has gone wrong in your three-neuron Petri dish
that you call a brain?
Yeah, the cats are brilliantly, you know.
Look, the, the what, okay, the, um, the distinctions between the gender stereotypes.
Sorry, I didn't mean to make so much dust.
The distinctions that we, the gender stereotypes can be draconian and stupidifying.
That's true, they can be.
Does that mean they only are?
Right?
It's the same problem with the idea of performative charity.
Is it only bad?
If you take a picture of yourself giving the money to the holy, to the, excuse me, the
holy person, the homeless person, for example, um, is that, is that, that was the example
that this guy gave, Bill, whoever the hell he is.
Um, is it only bad?
No.
Some of the features of the stereotypical qualities of gender are extremely important to have
in consciousness because gender is a holotype, a holophore, a fundamental basis for the understanding
of differentiation in identity matrices, right?
So, are you going to throw that away?
That's a dumb idea.
You might be, you know, it's like, well, I don't, these boats don't need hulls, we just
need oars, you know, all you need is a couple of oars and you're fine, never mind that hull
thing.
That's just a stereotype, that hull, right?
Airplanes don't need a fuselage, they just, it's just wings, that's all, just wings.
You know, with some engines on the wings, you're fine.
Nothing in the middle of them, nothing in there.
But my friend actually said something so amazing that really blew my mind because it had never
occurred to me and there were, we had so many of these little highlights where we were wandering
around together in our conversation and marveling at each other's unique intelligences and ways
of seeing and feeling and knowing and so forth.
And one of the things she said about her question was that it was like her question about nothing,
right?
She imagined transparency on top of transparency, like what she called clear on clear.
And later when we were talking about the absence of no, she said something very profound which was
that every time a man has kissed me, I felt no, no, no, no, no, no.
And I don't know exactly what she meant, but, by a man, I think, yeah, it's very complicated.
But apparent what she said was that the absence, right, the negation of a gender stereotype is
the direction of yes in her.
It's the direction of no knows, right?
It's an anti-knowing, anti-no-ing.
And so what she was saying was really profound because it had never occurred to me in my life
that the presence of a gender stereotype could mean the defection from relation, right?
Because now instead of relating with the person we're with, the being who's before and with us,
we're relating with them through a set of frames that are traps, and so we might pay more attention
to the frame than our partner.
In other words, we could be cheating on our partner with the frame of a gender stereotype,
and that was an absolutely mind-blowing proposition.
Nothing even vaguely similar to that had ever occurred to me, except that I saw inside the relationship
of some friends who I sometimes counsel, I saw the potential to cheat on one's partner,
not with another human being, but with one's history of traumatic experiences,
so that we defect from the relationship not to kiss somebody else, but to kiss something else, right?
Which is our historical investment in our personal traumatic history and problems and relationships and so forth, right?
So it became clear to me that one could, quote,
cheat in a relationship not with a person, but with a framework, and that blew my mind.
And what my friend here is saying is something very similar, except the framework is much more fundamental.
It's not the history of my personal trauma or relationships or fears or vulnerabilities.
It's the history of my masculinity and my identification with that, right?
I identify as a man, which is true, I do.
And so any threat to that, and I'll, you know, I'll defect right now, right?
Without consideration for the bond.
Goodbye, right?
Threaten my masculinity, I'm out of here.
Or threaten my relationship with it, right?
Threaten my identity as a masculine being.
Now, it doesn't mean I will leave a relationship at the slightest hint of a threat to my virility or masculine identity or anything.
In fact, quite the opposite.
I'm relatively well known to be an effeminate male.
I'm not merely effeminate.
I'm sort of an in-between, a bridge person, right?
Between the two stereotypes.
But I wouldn't toss those stereotypes.
At the same time, it was fascinating to hear my friend opine on the problem of there being a frame,
and how that's a trap, and how dangerous it is, and how it doesn't feel right, or it doesn't feel safe.
And that's brilliant.
Oh my God, what an insightful, articulate observation of being, right?
And she didn't just say, you know, a man is a bad, or a woman is a bad.
She was like, no, the existence of any of those frames is a problem.
I don't trust it.
It doesn't feel right.
In the intimate, you know, in the context of an intimate situation.
And, yeah, that was just mind-blowingly profound.
But it gets even more interesting.
So then we started talking about frameworks in consciousness,
and we went back to the original question of nothing.
What is the likeness of nothing whatsoever?
And the clear on clear is actually a description of what feels safe for my friend
in the domain of gender identity, right?
No gender identity on this side, no gender identity on that side, safe.
Interesting, attractive, feels good, feels the right kind of vulnerable, right?
That clear on clear, much like her concept of the appearance of nothing.
But then we were, you know...
Yeah, that person started to turn into a street that isn't a street.
How often I've been that person in my mind.
I tried to turn onto a one-way street in the wrong direction.
Or something that isn't a street that appeared to be one for a moment.
So, you know, I have this slogan that I like.
And I'm not a huge fan of slogans, but this one might be very important in our time.
And the slogan is simply, no more presidents.
We've had enough of this.
This is a bad fucking idea, especially around here.
And if that isn't obvious, given the candidates, I don't know what obvious means.
But, given the context of our conversation, my friend and I,
I suddenly blurted out, no more references.
And she's like, what do you mean?
And I said, just suspend the urge to make the gesture of reference in consciousness.
And she was like, oh, right.
And that became a mind-blowing exploration because
if you start from the position of the ability to suspend the urge to reference in consciousness,
which is to collapse consciousness toward the observation and evaluation of identities, right?
If you suspend that urge, you have absolute freedom to the degree you can suspend that urge.
And as long as you suspend that urge, all of your liberties are intact.
The moment that you start to collapse it, or if you don't have the ability to suspend that,
if you don't begin at the top of the cone, so to speak, with the suspension of the urge to reference, right?
And you start at the bottom, which is trapped in the urge to reference, to discern identities, to evaluate, to judge them,
then you are truly trapped.
It's a mess.
You are very unlikely to rise up that cone.
It's conceivable, right?
For example, at the moment, I am suggesting it in language, I'm suggesting it conceptually, right?
The suspension of the urge to reference in consciousness.
Actually, the urge to make the gesture of referencing, which is very similar to the gesture of pointing, right?
An urge that in Blackfoot culture is traditionally frowned upon.
You don't point.
It's not simply because it's rude.
It is penetrative, energetically penetrative.
But also, it creates a problem.
It creates a variety of problems.
If the gaze is a projection from the eyes into the world,
it encourages the penetrative version of the gaze,
rather than the gravidic, right?
Rather than drawing toward one,
or shedding light equally on all things.
She spoke of the difference between lantern consciousness and spotlight consciousness,
which is very important.
My friend did.
And a crucial feature of our conversation.
Because the spotlight consciousness really resembles a knife.
Whereas the lantern consciousness really resembles water.
Right?
Just flowing, encompassing, lifting all boats with one tide, so to speak.
Rather than singling one boat out for lifting and sinking all others.
So all of these ideas are profound.
But the crazy thing that happened was,
I have been a student of Zen since I was about 24.
So, that's 46 years.
I don't always sit.
But I do go through long phases of regular sitting.
And I was a serious Zen student for many years.
As those of you who know my videos probably are aware.
I began my practice with John Tarrant Roshi,
Dharma heir of Robert Aitken Roshi.
Who might be a Dharma heir of Suzuki Roshi,
but I don't remember Robert Aitken's teacher.
And then, when I came to the city,
I studied here with Joe Bobro for quite some time.
And I have a lot of reverence for Aitken and Tarrant.
And I'll not say much beyond that.
So why is this relevant?
Well, often the first koan one is given in Rinzai Zen tradition,
although California Diamond Sangha,
Tarrant Roshi's school, I think,
is not purely Rinzai.
It's sort of a mix of Rinzai and Soto traditions,
if I understand it correctly, intellectually,
which is really the opposite of understanding in the first place.
But one is often given a koan,
and quite frequently this koan.
It's a meditation point.
It's like a one,
it's a thing to focus the mind upon.
Some people think of a koan as a question
that has to be answered.
It's not entirely true.
It's not completely wrong,
but it's also just incorrect.
It's a perspective from outside Zen.
And it's because the teacher will request...
You know, the student,
the teacher will often ask in Dokusan,
which is a private interview
that occurs during the sitting practice,
the teacher will inquire of the student,
you know, what's going on?
Are you...
Have you gotten anywhere, so to speak?
What's happening?
Who are you?
Where did you come from?
What are you doing here?
And effectively,
the teacher is inquiring into progress
specifically with the koan,
which in many cases is mu, right?
Mo...
It's more like what John Tarrant would say
to emulate him.
But it's...
You know, it's a public case
in Japanese
or Chinese.
Chao Chu,
the old Buddha,
was with three monks.
They were walking along a path.
The monks came across a dog.
They're up ahead of him.
And the monks began arguing
about whether or not the dog
has a Buddha nature
because in their culture,
a dog is a disgusting
sort of vermin-ridden thing
to be avoided
and understood as reprehensible
and so forth,
which is a fairly bizarre idea
when you think about dogs.
How did this idea come about?
What the hell convinced people
what is because it seems servile?
What could possibly be the cause
of reviling the nobility
of the creatures that we call canines?
That's never really occurred
to me before.
But, um...
In any case,
in their culture,
you know,
the people eat dogs,
I guess, maybe,
or they just kill them
and they think they're...
Maybe they, uh...
Maybe they're not domesticated,
right?
So,
they rove in packs
and kill the farm animals
and so forth.
Who knows what the cause
of their hatred
of the animal is,
but the monks are arguing,
you know,
the Buddha's clearly said
all beings have true nature,
they have intrinsic Buddha nature.
All beings,
meaning, you know,
ants and elephants
and rabbits
and whales
and dogs
and all of them.
And so the monks are arguing,
yeah, surely this disgusting animal
has or does not have
Buddha nature.
So,
Chowchoo or Joshu
in Japanese
comes along
and sees the monks arguing
and they turn to him
and say,
you know,
tell us,
does the dog have
Buddha nature or not?
And Joshu says,
moo.
Or, you know,
oh.
Or even what those people
are saying over there.
Ah!
Which would be
a very interesting answer,
actually.
And one of the monks
awakens to his true nature
when he hears Joshu say,
moo,
which is essentially
the equivalent of no.
How could it be?
Right?
But how could it be
that the dog
does not have Buddha nature?
The Buddha was lying
about all beings
having Buddha nature,
right?
But in fact,
what it turns out
is that what Joshu
is saying no to
isn't necessarily
the question.
It's
the motivation
of the question,
which is the
urge
to make
the gesture
of reference
in consciousness
and then
to engage
in evaluations
and thus
be trapped
in the endless
prison
of frames
of identity
and meaning
and value
from which
there is no escape.
Ten thousand
lifetimes you can live
as a human being
and not escape
this fundamental trap
because you will
simply not discover
the power
of suspending
the urge
of reference
and how liberating
that is.
And from within
the trap,
if you make
the urge
of reference
and you follow
that urge
from within
the trap,
it will just
trap you more
thoroughly
every time
you make a move.
There are
disciplines,
logics,
there's a broad
array of different
kinds of logics
that are designed
to help you
with this trap.
You might
encounter ways
of knowing
like Korzybski's
non-Aristotelian
logics
or
null-A
or what is
called
general semantics
that could
conceivably
liberate you.
If you're
super lucky,
you might
encounter
Advaita Vedanta
or you might
encounter
Zen
or something,
right?
If you're
very lucky
and then you
pursue the hell
out of it
and you either
get super lucky
and you roll
like a 100
on the first
you know,
sometime in the
first week
of your practice
you just break
through.
It does happen
occasionally.
It's very rare
because what
usually happens
after that
is you just
get more
mired in
trouble the
harder you
try,
right?
And this
should be
obvious why
because
the one thing
you won't do
is suspend
the urge
to make
reference.
You're going
to try to
figure out
what Mu
means,
right?
Which is the
goal,
you think.
What is Mu?
That's what the
fucking teacher
asks you,
what is Mu?
So you think
it's a what?
Very similar
to the what
is the sound
of one hand
clapping.
Well,
that one hand
is the urge
to whatify
things and
it goes
what,
what,
what in
the air,
right?
So,
yeah,
very trippy.
She's,
everything we
had spoken
of suggested
to me
for the first
time in my
life.
No more
references,
right?
Never mind
no more
presidents,
no more
references,
no more
presidents of
consciousness,
right?
And it
is said
that if you
cut through
Mu,
it is as
if you
have cut
through
a roll
of cable,
right?
Or a
spool of
string or
thread.
It cuts
all the way
through all
the threads
at once
with a single
swipe,
right?
Slices right
through them
all.
And I
started looking
through the
book of
koans.
The
Mumon
Kaan,
right?
Which is
the primary
book of
koans in
our lineage,
the Mumon
Kaan.
What is
it?
The
barrier,
the
gateless
barrier,
right?
gateless
barrier,
it's
called.
And it
turns out
that if
you simply
suspend
the urge
to commit
the gesture
of reference
and consciousness,
it resolves
all koans.
I looked
at each
koan
and I
was
thinking
like,
what
happens
if you
suspend
the urge
reference?
Oops,
solved.
Why did
Bodhidharma
come from
the West?
Or not
come from
the West?
Does the
dog have
Buddha
nature or
not?
all these
things,
they are
immediately
solved
by the
suspension
of the
urge
to commit
the gesture
of reference
in consciousness.
Now,
this probably
won't cause
enlightenment
in my
listeners
to hear
this.
And this
is partly
why
the koans
exist.
Because you
could have
a 10,000
page book
where all
the pages
are blank
except the
middle page.
Right?
Page,
I don't
know,
4,999
or
5,001
or
which page
is the
middle?
This is the
same kind
of a problem.
Which page
is the
middle?
Is it the
middle of the
page in the
middle of the
book?
Do you count
the covers?
Does the
coverlet page
count?
Because it
doesn't have
a number.
All of these
questions that
we plague
ourselves with
as humans
all dissolve.
All of them
go away.
And you just
have liberation
if you suspend
the urge to
commit the
gesture of
reference.
Now,
hearing this
may help
you.
But this
is why
there's no
10,000 page
book within
the middle
of the
book,
right?
Wherever
that might
be,
is written.
Simply
suspend the
urge to
commit the
gesture of
reference in
consciousness
and you
will be
free.
And the
reason you
will be
free is
that from
that position,
if that's
your starting
position at
the point of
the cone of
identity,
right, from
the point of
the cone or
perhaps from
the point or
the ring or
perhaps from the
point and the
ring of the
cone, you can
then safely
commit the
gesture of
reference because
you will return
from that
activity to
non-identity,
right,
Korzybski's
solution,
non-identity.
A is not
equal to A.
One thing a
tree will never
be is a
tree.
A tree is a
word.
An actual
tree is the
infinite being,
infinite qualities.
Jesus.
Unlike that
horrifying
nightmare,
air of
noise.
So what
happens is
that if
your place of
your being is
outside the
trap, you
can then descend
safely into
the trap and
make reference
or not freely
because you
will always
dissolve back
into non-identity,
right.
This is what
Korzybski was
recommending.
He wasn't a
Zen master, he
was a logician
and a
mathematician
and an
engineer and
a spy in
the 30s.
such a
brilliant
mind.
He tried to
repair the
cognition of
humanity from
a problem at
its root.
And he
succeeded in
locating the
problem and he
succeeded in
formulating a
solution.
What he didn't
succeed at was in
making it
contagious.
he was a
liberator of
human minds and
he liberated
many of them in
his time but
his goal was to
bring liberation to
the world of
human beings, not
a few people.
And his book
Science and
Sanity, Science
and Sanity, is
the milestone of
his life work.
And the
pivotal feature of
that book, well
there's about 12
pivots.
They're fairly
simple, most of
them.
I won't explain
them here.
Others have done
this well.
it's not hard to
find.
But one of the
pivotal features is
a device that he
calls the structural
differential, with
which you physically
manipulate strings
and pegs to
understand the
problem of
identification and
the trap that it
comprises and how
it cannot be
true.
It is impossible
for it to be
true that what
you think about
something has
anything to do
with what the
thing you're
thinking about
is.
Because what
you think about
are reference.
And what you
think about are
actually tokens of
reference, with a
C on the end, and
what actually
exists are the
things they point
at, each of
which have
infinite qualities.
And so what
the humans do is
this thing called
exertion.
They exert
certain qualities
for attention,
promotion,
evaluation,
noticing, and so
forth.
And that
exertion is the
trap.
That's the
fingerprint of the
trap that we are
in as human
beings.
So I just got some
news.
Speaking of, you
know, this is the
thing, right?
So I'm going to do
the opposite of what
Bill was saying.
I'm going to
performatively explain
something, but my
son, some time
ago he called me
and he's like,
you know, my
buddy Reed, he's
recovering from
cancer and stuff,
and they canceled
his disability, and
they gave him a
bunch of forms and
shit, and he
can't fill them
out.
He's, you know,
he can't
understand the
forms, and he
doesn't understand
what's necessary or
why they canceled
his disability, and
he needs help.
So I went down
there, and over a
couple days, I got
all this documentation
together.
We filled out all
the forms.
Now this is like
five months ago
now or something,
right?
And I just came
across my friend,
and he's like,
dude, I went to
the bank on my
disability card.
I left 30 bucks
on it, and when I
went there yesterday,
there was $11,000
on my card, bro.
You got it done.
And I'm so happy,
right?
Never mind
stoicism.
We celebrate the
joys of the
people we love.
Stoicism is
valuable, reasonable,
useful, but we
still celebrate the
victories of the
people that we
love and care
about, especially
if they're struggling
and suffering, and
we can alleviate
some of that
somehow.
And yes, I get
the whole parable
about the farmer,
right?
This horse runs
away.
Everybody says,
oh, no, your
only horse is
gone.
How terrible.
And he says,
maybe.
A few days later,
the horse comes
back with five
other horses.
They all celebrate.
Oh, amazing.
Now you've got six
horses.
He's beautiful,
wonderful.
He says, maybe.
And it goes on
like this, right?
Switching back and
forth between
catastrophe and
joyful, you know,
abundance.
And of course,
this is true.
Okay, so back to
what I was talking
about.
So Korzybski
realized that there's
nothing you can
reference in
language.
Language is a
trap because
it depends on
exertion.
And the
results of
exertion are
deceptive.
Similar to the
problem with the
farmer.
So he tried to
get us out of
that trap.
He invented
non-Erestotelian
logic, null A,
also known as
general semantics.
But it was
too sophisticated
for common
consumption.
And some people
have tried to
resolve that since
then in various
ways.
No one's had
much luck.
it's relatively
difficult to
get the common
people to see
it.
In any case,
probably me
discussing this
will not
enlighten my
listeners.
But what it
will do is
establish the
compass.
It can give
you a direction
to travel toward
that is
trustworthy and
that you can
understand.
Like, I never
intellectually
understood.
I think I
now intellectually
understand the
resolution of
Mu, but I
haven't accomplished
it, I haven't
become that
resolution, which
is a non-verbal
experience, non-
intellectual
experience.
And yet, there
is at least the
possibility now.
And I love
having the
lighthouse, right,
on the ocean of
consciousness where
I can see the
trap.
From the
prison, you
can't escape, it's
very difficult to
escape from within
the prison.
From outside the
prison, you can
travel into the
prison and out of
it safely.
As long as your
identity, your
nature is felt and
established beyond
the prison of the
gestures of reference
and consciousness.
may we all
achieve liberation
and embody the
potential for the
virtues that are
natural to our
people and
ancestors and
world.
And may your
life be healed and
beautiful.
So grateful to
have this time
together today, and
I look forward to
learning and
growing and
discovering and
dreaming with you
all, together, with
and for each other, in
the future, sometime
soon.
Thank you for
joining me.
