Hello, everybody. Welcome. Some of you who've been following me are aware that over about
the past month and a half I've become interested in a very peculiar personality who we might
reasonably call a madman. I'm talking about Amon Hillman. And my initial recording about
him got more views than basically anything else I've made. And I'm not making videos about
him to chase views. I'm making videos about him. Because he's going to radically revise
ideas of historical situations that lead to the establishment of democracy in Greece and
Rome. The concept of democracy is born in the milieus he has expertly studied and which very,
very few other people have any idea about. And the reason that we have so little knowledge
and so little veracity to the knowledge we have. And this is why he's furious. He's pissed
that lies have long held the stage where the actual history of the development of what we
think of as, quote, the West has been hidden in what you could literally think of as rafts of
seething bullshit. Just straight up lying. Lying about history. Lying about origin. Lying about what what
was going on and what it meant. Lying about Christianity. Lying about Judaism. Lying about Islam. Lying. Just
massive swarming choruses of lying. And that's what we believe and think. And completely misconstrue our
own nature. The nature of history. And the origins of the societies that we tried and failed to establish in the
image of a democratic Athens or Greece. Now, I'm not extremely well educated about these matters. And
Hillman has been thoroughly blowing my mind. Yes, I'm aware he's nuts. That kind of doesn't matter. I don't
really care. And in fact, the peculiar kind of insanity that afflicts Hillman is recognizable to me. It's the
kind that afflicts prophets. It's a manis thigh. It's an oracular madness. And when he's talking, anyone who
knows, if there are even those who know, what he means when he uses this phrase, ionic.
What he means isn't an idea or a theory. It's not even a book or a literature. Though he obviously takes his
inspiration directly from primary sources. Not secondary sources, not theory. The closest thing we have to the
the closest thing we have to the first speech on things. But when he uses this word ionic, he uses it to
indicate an experience of death. And this doesn't necessarily mean that you die. He also uses it to mean
the particular experiences that arise from the Eleusinian mystery rites that he has become aware of through his
scholarship in ancient Greek.
And I want to be really clear, when Amun is reading ancient Greek, he's not reading it as a scholar. He's not merely reading it as a magician either. He's reading it as something we don't even have an idea about. He's reading it as a person who will draw from the fossilized remains.
He's reading it as a person who will draw from the fossilized remains of the beings and souls that are in that language the same way fossils are stratified in geological time.
He will resurrect those perspectives into his mind and become them, bring them to life, resurrect them as his own awareness, thought, concern, speaking.
His rhapsody, his rhapsody, his ecstasies of seeing beyond himself.
And he will straight up tell you that you don't need the complex kykion or the theriac, though you could perhaps use them if we could resurrect those rites.
These are polypharmaceutical, complex substances that are not mere pharmaceuticals the way that we think of them.
They come from the bodies of human beings.
They come from the bodies of human beings.
They are partly comprised of substances produced in specialized situations in human bodies.
And, you know, we have this idea modernly that you take a drug, it's like a, it's basically a powder, right?
And it changes something in your body.
So that illness can be influenced or amended or inhibited or evicted and so forth.
But long ago, it's very different.
It's impossible to know how they conceived of illness and medicine, but it certainly was not the way that we do.
Medicine was rebalancing a sort of a constellation of features in the body and the soul and the history and the future.
It was a rebalancing.
This is what is meant by antidote, I think.
And look, I'm going to make plenty of mistakes because I'm not, I'm still new to what, to the, the strange linguistic medicine that Hillman is composing with his own soul and mind.
He has become like those beings that produce medicine in their bloodstream and in their, in the secretions of their body.
But instead of producing it that way, I suspect he's using his mind, right?
He's using speech, he's using language to make that polypharmacon, that multi-drug, that superior to any specific drug, that superposition from which all drugs must arise.
Drugs must arise.
And he's not making drugs for fun.
He's making drugs to heal the world.
He's making drugs to reverse and to fight and to transform a situation that he can see because of his, his historical awareness is verging on apocalypse.
So what he's trying to do is prepare a kind of a vehicle that can carry some people through the crisis, the cataclysm or the cascade of crises and cataclysms.
And he will tell you directly that the ancient Greek is sufficient to carry you beyond your human life and to bring you into aeonic life and then back to humanity.
Now, there are so many things to discuss here, but I want to lay out a few foundations.
This stuff comes from what he's referring to when he uses the word Pulaskian, by which he means, I think, the originary cultures, the Scythian, probably young horsewomen who were capable of hunting men.
They were expert archers, they were lethal archers, their darts were poisoned and intoxicating.
They could paralyze the enemies by just touching them with something.
Now, I don't know, I'm drawing my understanding from a broad array of hints that Hillman's given.
In a fairly large variety of podcasts, his oeuvre is gigantic if you actually look at it, it's huge.
But I've been listening recently to Snappy and Neil and Hillman and others on Snappy's Drawing Down the Stars podcasts that are titled Occult Explorations.
And here there's a sort of grab bag, a really profound grab bag of amazing little gems that I'm going to try to collect into some essays over time.
And I want to talk about the milieu from which Hillman is drawing and what some of the principles of that milieu are.
The first is the primacy of the feminine, power of the virginal feminine.
And by virginal we don't just mean the idea that we have in English, right, which means the hymen is intact.
It's very complicated.
They were actually talking about the drum skins as the hymen of a primordial female god such as Athena in a podcast today.
And the causing that hymen to vibrate, right, that barrier, the barrier literally between worlds when you think about it, yeah?
Between inside and outside, between before and after, between life and death, between waking and sleeping,
between hunger and satiation, between eros and antipathy, right, this barrier.
Also, they spoke of the skin of the nurse that protects you in the ionic world.
That skin is Alethea's skin and it paralyzes enemies, freezes them solid, turned into stone.
These are not merely concepts, nor are they merely symbols.
These are superior to concepts and symbols, right?
These are things from which the possibilities of concepts and symbols derive their potential existence, right?
They are primordial matters that the humans once understood.
So, Aman is speaking of a place and a time where the Amazons and the witches, the feminine magi, female magi,
and the young girls who were trained in the arts of dance, polypharmacoi, murder, hunting, soldiery, right?
These women were indomitable.
And the cultures of men orbited them, depended on them, relied upon them, could not exist without them.
The women were revered.
They struck terror into the hearts of men.
Men were not seen as superior, but catastrophically inferior.
Absolutely dependent on the women.
Which is probably why you see, in our time, this bizarre and otherwise inexplicable denigration.
This denigration of the feminine, right?
Subjugation of the feminine.
That's where the power actually lives.
That's where it comes from.
That's the origin of the possibility of power.
Now, so we have this entirely different world in which specific young women are prepared for a role, a ritual role, a ceremonial role,
that is both psychopompic, right?
Right?
They stand at the gateway to the divine, to origin, to knowledge, to gnosis, to anamnesis.
They're the gatekeepers of memory.
They're the gatekeepers of possibility, the gatekeepers of power, the gatekeepers of healing, the gatekeepers of birth and death, the oracles, the prophets, the messiahs.
These women are luciferic.
And the whole concept of the dawn bringer and lucifer comes from these feminine star pairs.
Gosh, who are the twins?
I can't remember now.
It's important.
Perhaps it'll come back to me.
Dawn bringers, light bringers, right?
So the original Lucifer was not a man, not masculine.
I will find the right name from the ancient texts.
It might be Aletheia or the word that leads to Eleusinian.
I cannot remember.
They were the dawn stars, which, by the way, are firmly implicated in the enlightenment of both Jesus and the Buddha.
The dawn bringer, right?
Venus and or Jupiter in terms of what's in the sky, right?
All right.
So there were these.
The whole idea of messianism begins with females, not males.
Heroes, females.
I mean, even in English, there is the onomatopoetic idea that the hero is literally her, oh.
Or she says, oh.
Or, oh.
Or she's having an orgasm, right?
Right?
It's her orgasm.
The man who brings her to orgasm.
Who brings the earth to orgasm.
By the stimulation, not of her sexual urge, of her urges for justice.
For beauty.
For truth.
For rebalancing.
For the antidote to the origin of wrongdoing.
And fundamentally, the antidote to greed, selfishness, tyranny, lying.
The antidote to everything our civilization, quote unquote.
The antidote to everything our society is founded on.
The rebalancing that gives answer to eons, epochs of torture and torment and needless war,
stupidity, horrification, horror-ification of nature.
Right?
Lying.
Sadism.
A sadistic orientation toward life and women and motherhood and children and beauty and virtue.
Right?
This must be answered.
And those who answer this, they cause her, oh.
They cause her orgasm.
And that orgasm is both a cleansing menses and an anamnesis.
Right?
It's a casting off of all that has become decrepit.
Right?
Within the body, within the spirit, within the emotional sheaths, within the dreaming body.
All of this gets cast off.
Right?
And often it's cast off by catastrophe.
Yeah?
Apocalypse.
So, Amun sees a world where these women, various women, Medea particularly, origin of medicine,
medicine in her body.
A master of the use of venoms of insects, snakes, dusts, plants, dyes, substances.
And clearly, there are specific features of serums produced by the bodies.
So, in this case, according to specific Greek texts, the women learn to introduce the venoms
of serpents into their bloodstreams.
They make scratches on their skin.
They wrap bandages around those scratches that are infused with complex polypharmacopia, including venoms of snakes.
And they learned this changes their body in ways, that their body substances, vaginal secretions, breast secretions, sweat, earwax, spit, mucus, secretions of the anus.
All of these things become magically imbued with power, right?
And these women are masters of the use of these drugs.
They are the original doctors and healers, sorcerers, witches.
They are power incarnate, and they are terrifying.
They have found locks of hair.
Our archaeologists have found locks of hair infused with scopolamine and etura, among other substances.
Purple dyes, right?
Amun talks about the burning purple, and also the introduction of various drugs through and around the eyes, nose, and mouth,
including, clearly, substances produced from the human anus, right?
From the rectal area in humans.
And he specifically cites the use of serums from prepubescent male and female children.
This is perhaps the most controversial idea.
Because he's speaking of substances that have to do, or that are emergent from, the glands and genitalia of children.
Of a certain age, right?
Of a certain range of ages.
And not by killing the children and extracting things from them.
Though that may have had a role somewhere in there.
No, mostly it's serum produced from the breasts of prepubescent girls.
The penises of prepubescent boys.
Perhaps the vaginas and anuses of these young people.
Particular substances they, their bodies naturally produce.
That are utilized in theriac and kykyon.
The, um, and specifically the drugs that are administered in the right, in the mystery rites.
To produce death.
Or the transformation of the soul.
Where the soul is drawn beyond its ordinary human limitations.
Into the ionic universe outside of time.
Where the chorus lives.
The chorus out there is the model of democracy.
Right?
It's the voices of the many dead.
The voices of the yet unborn.
In one voice.
It's all voices as one voice.
Or all voices as a small, as a small group of voices.
Singing.
Anamnesis.
Singing the truth.
Singing justice.
Singing healing.
Singing unforgetting.
All right.
Hillman.
Describes various specializations of women.
The Meduzai.
The Meduzai.
Who were warrior, priestess, huntresses.
They hunted warriors.
They hunted men.
Their dreads were filled with different intoxicants.
As if their head had become a pharmacy.
They were midwives.
They were the most expert midwives.
Because they could modulate the humors of the body of the birth giving mother.
They had sedatives.
They had coagulants.
They had anticoagulants.
They had drugs that inhibited bleeding.
They had paralytics.
They had psychedelics.
But the psychedelics were not primarily for recreation.
They were for visioneering in a very specific array of anciently sacred contexts.
That involved the concept of liberation from slavery.
These were liberating beings.
They could liberate you from the inhibitions of your everyday human masculinity or femininity.
Very easily.
By administering drugs.
By administering drugs.
By administering drugs.
They guarded the temples.
Byмотри.
fox
By lawyer.
Orص
de Langley.
These are important prepar aliens and physical storms.
They guarded the temples.
temples. These were the origins of beings like Mnemosyne, the Mayanads, the mad prophetess
young women who slaughtered heroes, the sirens, Hypatia, Hecate, Joan of Arc in her way, the women.
One thing Alman's got absolutely correct is the precedence of the feminine. I mean, us
moderns, we are catastrophically confused and we think that physical prowess is power
or that physical prowess belongs to the masculine. Wildly untrue.
Even though, commonly, the masculine musculature is profoundly overdeveloped compared to the
musculature of women. But anyone who's studied history knows that that apparent imbalance
is deceptive because those male bodies are literally born from, they start out as organs
in a female body. They start out as women. Women produce men.
Hillman isn't making this stuff up. It's not theory. He doesn't give a shit about ideas. He doesn't
care about them at all. He doesn't care about biblical scholarship or the academy. He is by his own
admission a ronin, a masterless samurai. Let me tell you what he cares about. He cares about the ancient
Greek sources. And their capacity to carry as a vehicle the intelligences of the dead and to resurrect
them before us. To bring them to life. The ancient language can bring the intelligences of our
ancestors and of these branches of history can resurrect them in our own minds because they are
in the language in like living fossils in the layered geological strata, right, of
of the mystery of actual history. The living mystery of history. He also knows something that I have long known
that is very difficult. You can tell this to modern humans but they don't usually get it. They won't
really understand you. You can tell them that the minds of the ancients were nothing like ours.
They did not see the same things we see
when we look at a tree or an animal or a plant or the sky or the stars. Their minds were not like ours.
They weren't merely pre-representational. They were capable of making representations in consciousness.
They were capable of having concepts. What they probably weren't capable of...
One of the things that makes them unlike us is that they could not
lose their participation
into abstract reference with tokens like we do when we say the word tree.
And for them, spelling was fundamentally transcendental.
It was entrancing. It was magical. It was powerful. It was new.
The idea of spelling is where we get this word spells from. And again, you can say these things to moderns.
They will not understand you. They will hear the words. They will not understand what you're saying.
They will not have the realization. Oh! Oh, you mean S-E-A.
But today, the ocean starts with a snake. It begins with a snake that cuts through the chaos,
leading to the energetic emergence of firstness in the Aleph, in the Alpha, in the Primordial.
So, they won't get it. You have to read them the poems of the spelling.
Right? Because it's the same thing with S-E-E.
It's the bipolar wave form the snake makes in the sand in the sky.
The snake makes that same wave form in origin.
Right? Leviathan makes that wave form in origin.
And thus, the possibility of emergence arises.
And this leads to emotion.
The movement of energy caused by seeing.
S-E-E. This is spelling.
It's not casting spells, you see.
It's an amnoetic understanding coming to you in the language.
This is what Hillman's attempting to say, and nobody can understand it.
I mean, there's people around him who revere his enthusiasm, which is profound, right?
He's actually enthusiastic.
And some people mistake this like, oh, he's on drugs.
He's like doing meth.
They're out of their fucking minds.
They have no idea what they're looking at.
These are like people who...
These are like people who've seen the Wright Brothers plane, right?
And they think they know what airplanes are and are for
because they saw that Wright Brothers sort of biplane gliding thing.
These are people who've built those, right?
They've built those and they think they're geniuses and magi because they built one of those.
And they see a UFO and they're like, that's not even a thing.
What is that?
That's just like someone on drugs.
No, it's the opposite.
They're on drugs.
They're on the drugs of certainty of lies, right?
They're certain about shit that isn't true.
They're absolutely certain about shit that isn't true.
And they think that flies.
They think that's what flight is, is to be certain about shit that cannot be true.
And Amun comes along, he's like, look, I don't know, but here's what's in the language.
Here's what the ancients left us to point in a direction of the mystery of history that is alive
with the minds and souls of the beings who brought it.
They brought this history, this mysterious living strands of the spirit, the genius loci of places
and times in history.
And what Amun has done, which is insane, is he's become a stage upon which those forces
resurrect their intelligences right before your eyes and no one can understand it.
And so some people are freaking out and they think he's nuts.
They think all kinds of things or they just adore him and they think he's very entertaining,
which is, you know, true.
He's nuts, true.
He's entertaining.
Yes, he is.
He's a maniac.
Yep, he's a maniac, right?
But one of the things he's trying to say is that not only were the ancients, these women,
warrior, priestess, pharmacologists, doctors, sages, magi, spirit travelers, right?
These women could travel, they could OBE at will and they could lead other people to OBE,
right?
To get out of the body right now, right?
Touch you, you're out of the body.
That power, right?
The gatekeeping power between the world of the ordinary and the world of the non-ordinary,
what we usually call or think, we may think of as the supernatural.
They were the arbiters of that distinction.
With the touch of their fingertip, you would go unconscious.
They were power walking, right?
You can imagine like the power of something absurd, say the power of a nuclear weapons detonation,
walking around in a 14-year-old young woman, archeress, mistress of snakes,
mistress of venoms and antidotes.
That's the kind of thing he's talking about.
He worships it.
He's in love.
He's madly in love.
And he will tell you straight up, not only were they not afraid of psychosis, they used it.
They used the focused power of psychotic mania to achieve aeonic liberation.
And that is the origin of the possibility of democracy.
Think about it.
Ah, I love it, he would say.
Ah, beautiful, beautiful.
Just as I've said this, I find on the ground the dried body of a newt.
Yeah, the dried body of a newt, I find it.
Magic.
Sign of magic.
Little worm.
Almost a snake.
All right.
And it wasn't just the snakes that had venoms.
It was mollusks.
It was mucus.
Mycenae, literally named after the mushroom, that slime on the mushroom.
Right?
They knew about all these matters.
They understood the linkage between lubrication and psychedelia.
Lubrication and orgasm.
Lubrication and power.
Lubris.
Lubrisia.
So many things to learn here.
Such amazing mystery.
And by that, I mean history.
When Hillman says, history isn't, it's not a fucking story.
It's not a story, bruh.
It's a question.
It's a question you bring to life.
You bring the question to life.
Like an angel in your soul.
And you chase the light of that question.
Until the answers are resurrected in your own body.
In the substance of you.
He might say.
If he were bold enough.
I mean, one of the great things about him is that he does hold back.
But he's incredibly bold.
He doesn't give a shit about anything that anyone's going to think.
And he also has an incredible disdain for commercial behavior.
Anybody who's making money, writing books, blah, blah, blah, doesn't give a shit about those people.
And in fact, he will straight up tell you that that is what keeps the lying, the layers of abject bullshit history in place.
It's all these people who write books and have academic careers to protect.
And want to maintain their authority and their position.
And he despises these people.
He loves to piss them off.
He's like, nothing's better than pissing those people off.
That's his favorite fucking pastime.
And it's because when he began to discover these features of ancient life.
Probably particularly in the works of Galen.
Which nearly nobody paid any attention to.
And he wrote about them in his dissertation.
His advisor said, yeah, well, you've got to take out all that stuff about drugs.
Like, wait a minute, what?
Why?
Oh, well, because the Romans wouldn't have done that.
And you've got to try to imagine his brain exploding in his head when he hears this.
Absolutely just losing his shit.
Because he's just been reading exactly about what the ancients were specifically doing.
Fascinated by, motivated by, interested in the origins of the possibility of the university.
The origins of the possibility of democracy.
Came from the use of drugs.
And these people were saying, well, yeah, those, you know, the archaic virtue of the ancients
couldn't have sustained contact with this kind of intoxicatory, revelatory, sexual, you know, provocative partying.
Meanwhile, he knows exactly the opposite is true.
He knows it.
He doesn't know it from thinking or supposition or theory.
He knows it from having read thousands of pages of ancient Greek.
And you can say, well, he's just reading one guy and he's kind of transferring.
Uh, yeah, except there's 19 guys.
Yeah, sure, he reads a lot of Galen and Nonis and stuff.
Yes, yes.
But, uh, Aeschylus and, you know, 15 other ancient fragments, all kinds of shit.
So, the chances that he's confused and the scholars have it right, pretty much zero.
Nobody's read what he's read.
And he's not the kind of guy, he does have an agenda, right?
It's true, he has an agenda.
He might claim he doesn't, but he does.
His agenda is to obliterate the lying bullshit of the academy, the Bible scholars, religious scholars, and so forth.
All of whom are attempting to preserve a lie as the central narrative of the history of religion and Western thought, philosophy, and so forth.
All this stuff begins with the mystery religions, the mysteries, the Eleusinian mysteries, and the, uh, the rite or the rites where the female psychopomp administers a polyintoxicant that effectively kills you.
Um, and then before you actually physically die, she resurrects you with an antidote.
So that you return to life unafraid of death and knowing the secret of, the secrets of being and origin and anamnesis.
And you become the living representative, the living inaction of those virtues here on earth.
Uh, the blindness of the statue of justice, right, is what is represented here.
Ionic clear sight.
Perfect ionic clear sight.
Imagine that, um, you know, I once had the intuition that an angel is a being that never moves.
It never moves.
And since it never moves, all movement is relative to it.
And since all movement is relative to it, all of movement is its body.
All of movement is its mind.
All of movement is its memory.
It causes all of movement by a form of multidimensional absolute stillness.
A stillness that becomes more absolute in more dimensions each moment.
A burgeoning stillness, right, a burgeoning stillness, exploding, recursively self-generating stillnesses within the angel.
Now imagine that your mind is drawn up from your body into origin.
To the point of the cone of all being, dwelling in that point from which all being radiates, all intelligence radiates, all transcendence radiates, all energy radiates, all birth and death radiates, all gendering radiates.
All knowledge, all wisdom, all wisdom, all healing, all medicine, the living library of infinite vastness.
You become it.
And the chorus of the dead and the unborn is all around you, right?
This is what the idea of the democracy comes from, is this chorus.
The voices of the many, having been lifted above their ordinary human concerns of selfishness and greed and nonsense and power, political affiliation, all of religion, academia, all these things, right?
They're lifted up all beyond that to represent virtue itself.
What is virtue itself?
What is that virtue?
What is it?
What is virtue?
So, the idea is to be freed of all human concern and entrapment so that first clear seeing ensues, which children have, because they are not yet encumbered.
Children often have many features of clear sight, what I'll call, you know, I'm coining a word here, this clear sight word.
So do mothers, though, because mothers are seeing for their children and some fathers, too, and some grandmothers and some grandfathers.
They're seeing for the children, for the sake of the children.
When you see for the sake of the children, when you see for the sake of the mothers, the grandmothers, the unborn mothers, the future mothers, then you will see clearly, much clearer in any case.
So Hillman is a very strange thing, and the people who are critical of him, they have no idea what he's up to.
It's not even really worth listening to them.
If you want academic knowledge, if you want conceptual knowledge, then you can go ahead and listen to those people, because that's what their game is.
That's what they're there for.
They're there for that.
Hillman is not there for that.
Hillman is there to act.
Hillman is there for that.
Yes, I see you.
Hillman is there for that.
Again, these people are going to have no idea what Hillman is or what he's up to, what he's
doing, what his goals are, because they have nothing to do with the goals of scholarship
or academia, except in the fact that, like them, he studies.
They think, oh, he studies, we study, therefore we're supposed to be the same bird, he's supposed
to act like we do.
No?
Wildly untrue.
Hillman would say, no, you've got this backwards.
You are not supposed to act like you're acting.
You guys are lying.
You're preserving a broad system of narratological bullshittery that has been dominating the academy
and civilization and is about to be obliterated by justice.
That's what he thinks.
And he may be right.
I mean, it's hard to imagine that he's not got that right.
It's just a matter of, like, well, how much time before the obliteration happens.
The reason Hillman is teaching ancient Greek is that he is become the Theriac.
He's going to give as if his mind is Medea's breast, as if his speech is the milk from her tits,
is the secretions of her colpoi.
He is giving.
When he says, I'm going to give you this, I'm going to give you this, this is what he means.
He is conveying the liquid intoxicants and antidotes with his speech.
He is an ecstatic, mantic prophet.
He's not trying to tell you, he doesn't give a shit about his name or the future or any of that.
He is a human being.
He has an ego and stuff, right?
But what he's committed to is virtue.
And he knows, he will also tell you that these priestesses,
there was a necessity which was the purgation of the polis, the purgation of the choir.
They would cleanse the choir by yelling at it and accusing it and whipping it and beating it, right?
And the play that he was giving that got him fired from his academic position, typically stupidly, right?
He was trying to do, you know, he was sacrificed in a very similar way to how Socrates was sacrificed.
And for very similar purposes.
Thankfully, they didn't actually murder him.
They just murdered his academic career.
Which was a good thing.
Because if they hadn't, he might have become enchanted by it, right?
And we wouldn't have the Amun-Hilman that we have before us today.
Anyway, and by the way, even when he was back there at the university,
and this is really important, because, you know, Amun's detractors.
And look, I think Dan McClellan is an amazing scholar.
I love listening to him.
I love hearing him tear down bullshit on the internet.
Who's that other guy?
One of Dan's friends who was on Gnostic Informant's podcast.
I can't recall his name.
In any case,
These guys,
they
are
athletic supporters of the academy.
You know,
what Hillman was doing,
Okay, here's the thing.
Hillman,
did Dan McClellan ever clean the toilets at his university?
Just, you know,
ask him sometime.
Were you willing to go in there and clean the toilets?
Was that other guy who likes to criticize Hillman,
anyone who likes to criticize Hillman,
did they go to the academy?
Did they go there
and go
janitorially clean up the bathrooms?
The thing that was least desirable to do?
To work in the stink,
in the mess that nobody wants to touch?
Because that's what Hillman was doing.
He wasn't just teaching ancient Greek
to a fascinated
and aroused student body.
He was cleaning the toilets himself at night.
He was willing to do the things that nobody would do.
He believed in the possibility of education
in a way that was
maniacal and brilliant.
So those guys didn't clean the toilets.
They just sat up at the podium,
you know,
prospering from the attention
of the masses
and
infecting
the masses
with
the well-articulated
narratives
that
the lying
layers
of historical
narrative
depend on
for their survival,
for their reproduction,
for their contagion,
for their sustenance,
like dead churches
whose pillars
are falsehoods.
You know,
anyone who believes in virtue
wants truth.
So what they're going to want to do
is, you know,
if we've got a narrative about history
or ancient peoples
or the origins
of religions
or even language
or technology,
then we want what's,
we want the best stuff we can get.
We don't,
what we don't want
is to go
to fucking
the mall
and buy some
off-the-shelf
composite
conglomerate
bullshit
that prevails
not because
it has
veritas
or gravitas
actually it has gravitas
not because it's veritable
it has no veracity
it prevails
because it mimics
veracity
skillfully enough
to be hyper-contagious
and thus be preserved
above all truth.
It's the difference
between porn
and the first kiss
of romance.
This is the difference.
And weirdly,
you know,
I don't know,
I can't speak for Amman,
but what he's saying
is that
historical,
intellectual,
and philosophical
and philosophical
historical,
intellectual,
philosophical
and religious
pornography
is detestable.
He hates it.
He wants to be a living knife
that cuts through it
and he is the avatar
of those feminine intelligences.
They are alive in him.
When he was making
the play,
Medea,
he was teaching
the actors
how to purge
the audience,
right,
using this alabastrum,
but also he had
this riding crop
and the lead actress
who was brilliant,
he knew that she needed
to know
what exactly
had been going on
back in the day.
So he
basically got down
on stage
and had her
whip him.
Now,
you can think
anything you like
about that.
You can think
like he's
perverted,
right,
he's enacting
his erotic fantasies
with his students.
You could think,
you know,
strange,
of don't stand
so close
by the police,
right,
and you might
not be entirely
wrong with those
thoughts,
but let me tell you
what's actually
going on
because it isn't
fucking that,
right,
that's the
puerile interpretation.
What's actually
going on
is magical.
He is partly
invoking
the ancients,
bringing them
back to life,
resurrecting them.
When he puts
that crop
in the hand
of the actress
who will play
Medea,
he wants
to know,
he wants her
to physically
know
what it was
like to be
Medea,
and he wants
to be
subjugated.
He's willing
to serve
that intelligence.
He trusts
that intelligence.
when she
strikes him
with that
crop,
it's ringing
a historical
bell
that rises
up through
the fucking
epochs
and lands
in her heart
and comes
to life.
She will be
transformed
forever.
He will be
transformed
forever.
This is what
he means by
history
and mystery,
not
bullshit
narratives
written 12,000
times
and reproduced
over and over
again
in the lying
mouths of
academicians
who seek
the acclaim
and the funding
of
the features
of those
structures
that preserve
blasphemy
and call it
holy.
Now he tells
us,
you can tell,
one of the
things you
can easily
see about
Hillman
is that
he understands
the origins
of democracy
and he
believes
in democracy.
He believes
in educating
the polis,
right?
Because without
an educated
polis,
population,
there's no
chance of you
having a democracy.
And what does
education mean?
There's the voice
of the polis
right there.
the chorus,
the chorus,
you see?
Chorus.
What does
education mean?
Well,
it partly
means
having seen
beyond
all systems,
all politics,
all narratives,
all stories,
all greed,
all structures
that attract
mundane human
concern,
inaction,
awareness.
He is the
opposite of a
thrisp,
right?
He is the
opposite of a
dead process,
Hillman,
a dead process
that captures
whole cohorts
of humans
and then goes
about enacting
atrocity and
claiming it to
be virtuous.
Google,
Twitter,
Facebook,
Instagram,
Pinterest,
TikTok,
all this shit,
YouTube.
He's the
opposite.
Yeah,
I get that
YouTube brings
you the video
that you're
listening to
right now,
but it's just
because I
couldn't reach
you without
YouTube.
How would
you find me?
Like,
maybe if I
wrote a book
or something
you could
find me.
Maybe,
maybe.
But yeah,
he's like
cutting through
the fucking
mauldom
of the
academia
and the
university,
which is
the absolute
abomination
of that,
is staggering.
That's the
place where
you're supposed
to go to
gain the
capacity for
anamnesis,
for insight,
for wonder,
for awe,
for participatory
exaltation
beyond
everything you've
been crammed
into as a
human being.
You are so
much more
than the
dried husk
of the
humanity you've
been sold,
and almond
wants to bring
that lubricant,
that hallucinogenic,
intoxicating,
exalting lubricant
back into
your spirit
and revive you
from the
wrong kind
of death,
right?
You can see
that human
culture is
the malignant
opposite
of the
death-inducing
intoxicants
that the
oracular
priestwomen
would introduce
into your
mouth and
your eyes
and your
orifices
and your
bloodstream,
right?
That communion
which would
reawaken you.
This is the
opposite kind
of a death,
right?
Where we're
given false
intoxicants,
counterfeit
drugs that
aren't real
and rights
that aren't
real.
The march
of politics,
the march
of monotheism,
the march
of the
fucking
academy.
Peer
review itself
isn't a bad
idea in
science,
but the
implementation
of the
journals is
a money-making
proposition.
Poisoned
science,
right?
Fake
intoxicants,
bullshit,
lying.
The
preservation
of false
gatekeepers
between us
and discovery,
anamnesis,
recognition,
remembering.
So Amon is,
you know,
he's a fucking,
he's a human
hypodermic needle.
He's,
except that he's
divinely
encompassed,
right?
The muses
sit around
this man
as if in
an amphitheater
casting
lightning bolts
into his
heart,
right?
And causing
him spasmodically
to emit
the nectar
that resurrects
the muses
in his
listeners.
You know,
it's modern,
we think,
oh yeah,
the muses,
you know,
what does that
even mean?
Okay,
well,
you go to
the museum,
right?
What is that
for you?
Don't you
realize
there's a
living version
of that?
There's a
living version
that's not
about exhibits.
The museum
is where
the muses
are gathered
to adore,
to enthuse,
to catalyze,
to inspire
the most
profound
of the
beauties
of the
arts
and the
sciences,
the true
arts and
sciences,
music,
poetry,
oration,
lovemaking,
origin,
anamnesis,
the muses
are gathered
around
and they
are dancing
and their
dance
inspires
the beings
who listen
to them,
the children
and the
young adults
and the
adults
and the
elderly
people
who make
art
and who
make art
truly in
their soul.
The best
of them
are never
known by
humans
because their
art is not
consumed
by humans,
it's consumed
by angels.
The angels
gather around
their art
in awe
and say,
ah,
yes,
this is
worth it.
Finally,
a being
has done
something so
beautiful
that it
will live
and become
immortal,
not among
the humans,
in the
body of
origin.
This
is what
Hillman is
talking about.
You see,
Hillman hasn't
read about
ionic life.
Any scholar
could read about
ionic life and
have ideas.
That's not what's
going on at all.
Hillman died.
He died.
Right?
He's seen
the ionic
and I know
because I have
also seen it.
I know the
muses are real
because they
gather around
me when I
make.
And I don't
make for my
sake,
I make for
theirs.
The museum
is the
living library
of the
sublime
excellences
in all
of time
and space.
And it
is alive.
There are
no dead
exhibits.
There are
no frames.
there are
no signatures.
It is
a gift.
It is the
origin of
inspiration
to beings
all throughout
time space.
You know,
this idea
of the
chorus.
I mean,
it might be
the most
primordial idea
you could
possibly have.
Okay,
look,
it is not
as if there is
a list of
primordial ideas
and one is
at the top.
It is a matter
of your concern
determines what is
at the top of
the list.
The way we
think,
this sort of
one thing
mind or
what is the
most X,
you know,
what is the
most X,
instead of
what is the
most excellent,
which means
exceptional,
not in the
sense of being
the best
or the top
or the highest
in the sense
of being
beyond
categorization,
the superposition,
right,
achieving superposition
while still
holding form,
yeah?
This is what the
humans reach for
in our arts,
in our sports,
in our,
we should be
reaching forward
in our political
systems,
we've abjectly
failed there,
that whole thing
has been captured,
our societal
systems,
and Hillman
wants a
resurrection
of a
rete,
of excellence,
in human
social
milieu,
right,
milieus,
contexts,
he wants that,
he's starving
for it because
the muses
want that,
the mothers
want that,
the grandmothers
want that,
everybody wants
that,
right?
That's the thing
everybody wants,
every child is
born in some
way aching
to reform
the monumental
malignant
lies of the
cultures that
presently exist.
No culture
was ever
perfect,
but similarly,
no culture
that's ever
existed before
us had the
absolute
absolute
potential for
19 kinds
of perfection
per minute
just being
cruci-
just ruinated
by greed
and commerce
and power
and the
preservation
of lies
and so forth,
right?
we're like
swimming in
okay,
socio-relationally
we are like
our species
has become
like organisms
that live
in a sewage
dump
that radioactive
and fucking
commercial waste
is globbed
into
a billion times
per picosecond
by every
you know
when Zappa
wrote
that song
that has
the lyrics
it's the
slime
oozing out
of your
TV set
right?
that's what
he was talking
about
that ideological
sewage
informational
sewage
that we
like some
kind of
disgusting
yet you know
half holy
annelid
some worm
were like
squirming around
in this stuff
you know
if only we
were as good
as worms
and we could
compost it
into something
beneficial to life
but that's not
what's happening
what's happening
is the opposite
life is being
ground up
and spit out
in dead
histories
dead futures
dead mothers
dead children
it's just being
ruined
for the sake
of
fictions
lies
corporations
political systems
that suck
that literally
suck
right?
literally
vampiric
they eat
children
and spit out
the dead
remains
and build
their palaces
of power
on the
graveyards
of the
forgotten
and the
enslaved
and that
just has to
fucking stop
right?
Hillman hates
that stuff
he's not a
pervert
he wants
a revision
to the
foundations
of power
just like
every child
wants
and you know
when we're
children
we direct
our
our urges
for virtue
and truth
aletheia
we direct
them at our
primarily at our
parents
and the school
system
because that's
the first
those are the
first authorities
we encounter
and it's not
misguided
it's natural
but
it's not our
parents fault
though they
should dip
themselves
in the
resurrecting
virtue
of anamnesis
and dreaming
and excellence
and wash
clean their
histories
and narratives
and thoughts
and biases
and opinions
and perspectives
and concepts
and namings
they should
have
that resurrection
and the
child
knows
if not
consciously
subconsciously
that
they are
the vehicle
of that
they have
come fresh
from origin
to remind
the adults
to
anamnoeticize
them
to
anamnoesize
them
to cleanse
them of
the lies
and
the
lethal
allegiances
that the
adults
have in
them
like hooks
like hooks
that penetrate
their skin
you know
in the
in the
sun dances
where the
indigenous
Americans
they
they put
bone hooks
through their
bodies
that link
them to
a central
pillar
a pole
that's
that kind
of
cleansing
that
reminds
them
of
origin
that's
the
purgation
that
Hillman
is talking
about
as a
necessity
for the
possibility
of
democracy
you can't
have
democracy
with an
uneducated
polis
you can't
have
democracy
with an
unpurged
polis
you have
to have
deep and
profound
education
and purging
cleansing
not
murder
not
not the
kind of
cleansing
that we
associate
with
I mean
I don't
know
what he
would suggest
but
he doesn't
seem to
me
to be
you know
the kind
of a
prophet
that's like
yeah let
blood fill
the gutters
let's purge
ourselves
of all
of these
seething
lying
political
politically
greedy
I'm
remembering
remembering
a phrase
from
from a
poet
a poet
friend
but I
can't
quite
recover
it
yeah
Hillman
I don't
think
Hillman
is
suggesting
any
kind
of
you know
genocidal
cleansing
I don't
think so
I don't
know his
mind
maybe he
realizes
that
in
cataclysm
in the
resurrections
that
the cataclysm
brings
there are
naturally
you know
tyrants
are destroyed
right
he talks
a lot
about this
and how
the current
situation
lends itself
to the
historical
resemblance
and echo
that
established
tyrants
over
Athens
and Greece
and before
that
in other
places
the
Pulaskian
situation
perhaps
and how
these
tyrants
were
eventually
destroyed
right
he does
talk some
about that
but I don't
know what his
mind is
what I'm
trying to say
however is
that
the
purgation
is a part
of the
rite
that he
speaks of
this mystery
rite
whereby
one
is
devastated
by the
wise
gnosis
the
the
nectars
of gnosis
in the
women
the
oracles
priestesses
the magi
women
that bring
you to
the edge
of death
cause you
there to
hover
and then
resurrect you
so that you
are liberated
and now
you represent
the chorus
the many
voices
the one
voice
comprised
of the
many
voices
and
the thing
that connects
the voices
is virtuous
concern
virtuous
historical
memory
virtuous
medicinal
knowledge
virtuous
intellect
virtuous
poesis
virtuous
rhapsody
these are
the things
these are
the features
of existence
that are
valuable
and worth
protecting
and preserving
this is what
Amen is
concerned about
people think
that because
he talks
about
things
that they
find
disgusting
or perverse
or
anathema
right
that he
is
the
that he
is suggesting
that these
things are
virtuous
that's not
what's going
on
in fact
quite the
opposite
Hillman is
a clear
minded
classicist
who's looking
at what the
primary texts
tell us
about the
priorities
of the
ancient life
where the
language of
Greek
originated
the language
that other
historical
languages
emulate
or pretend
to be
superior
to
or
prior
priority
right
see that
word
priority
it doesn't
mean above
it means
before
so for
example
you know
he mocks
the people
perhaps somewhat
confusedly but
at the same
time in a
valid way
he mocks
the people
that
celebrate
Hebrew
because he's
like look
talking about
language that
had 8000
distinct
terms at
the time
some kind
of an
Old Testament
was composed
like in the
Old Testament
in the Torah
there's 8000
unique words
Greek has a
couple of
hundred thousand
and you can
coin words
in Greek
I'm not
trying to
pun with
I don't
know how
to pronounce
it because
I've never
heard it
properly
pronounced
K-O-I-N-E
He's saying
nah the
Greek looks
like it
has priority
to him
now of
course he's
a Greek
scholar so
naturally he
might say
that but
he does
have a
point
right the
Greek went
around obliterating
other languages
and replacing
them in a
way that
resembles the
tragic capacity
of English to
destroy languages
in our present
time
the chorus
yeah that
might be the
most important
idea because
what you
don't want
is a bunch
of individuals
seeing for
themselves and
their line and
their children
and their
you know
just them
right the
selfish seeing
you want the
seeing for all
beings you want
the seeing outside
of time you
want clear
sight you want
the seeing for
the sake of the
virtues for the
sake of wisdom
and truth
nobility and
justice not
justice as
punishment
justice as
antidote to
malignancy
right
justice as
rebalancing
justice as
healing
not
justice as
vengeance
so you
know
Hillman's
going to
go on being
wildly
misunderstood
and I'm
not claiming
that you
know history
is going to
remember him
who knows
perhaps his
voice will be
completely lost
it doesn't
I don't think
Hillman himself
cares about that
what he's
concerned with
is wonder
and virtue
and anamnesis
like true
remembering
resurrection
clear sight
and
particularly the
resurrection of
the intelligences
and the
geniuses
the prodigies
that lived in
the ancient
world in
the women
and the
children
the grandmothers
of the
Duzai
Medea
Hecate
Hypatia
he's
he's a
metafeminist
you don't
hear him
singing the
praises of
men
he is
constantly
singing the
praises of
women
he's in
love with
them
he adores
them
he is
their
protector
he speaks
for them
it's not
Hillman up
there speaking
the muses
surround him
and rack
him with
their whips
and he
thus
enthused
enlightens
us
it's beautiful
I love it
beautiful
gorgeous
thank you
for joining
me
so glad
to have
this time
together
and to
clarify
why I
am
interested
in
Hillman's
mania
much love
to you
and yours
may we
pull
the veils
from our
sleeping
eyes
and achieve
the blindness
that leads
to virtue
and wonder
and amnesis
and awe
together
with and
for each
other
and the
history
and future
of all
beings
take a

I look
forward to
