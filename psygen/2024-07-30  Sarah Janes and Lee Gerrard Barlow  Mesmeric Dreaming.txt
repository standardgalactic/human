so so if i could ask you to mute yourselves for the time being that would be handy not you lee
obviously
so lee and i have known each other for many years now i can't remember when the first
time i ever met you lee it would have been um did i come on i came on your esoteric occult
tour of the egyptian galleries at the british museum but i can't remember now whether that
was before or after you did an explorers club for me in st leonard's i in my mind i remember that i
came and did the explorers club first okay oh you did mesmer you did mesmerism at the cave gallery
i remember that was a legendary a legendary event yes so that would have been about 2012 or something
like that uh probably yes yeah so lee and i have kind of kept in touch over the years and our
interests are obviously very similar we're both um interested in the mysteries in um ancient magic
ancient religion and we've just been discussed discussing the mysteries of lfc now and we've
both spent a lot of time in greece and uh as lee was just saying we seem to go to the same places
all the time but miss each other by uh not very long period so um lee would you like to introduce
yourself and tell everyone what you're up to these days and what you have been up to until these days
all right okay so um let's see so i've been working hard at these sort of working with the mysteries in
one way or another whether it's um working with inner traditions or whether it's working in a way where
i have some aspects of it that i can teach in the external world for about the last 25 years or more
i would say more now um i in a nutshell what i'll say is i got interested in um nlp in hypnosis um
um but as i was describing in a recent interview with one of our mutual friends here darren um i
actually did an interview with him recently and uh he asked me where did do you think this all really
started um i said well basically it started after i'd gone for a walk and i did a very very long walk
and discovered by doing that walk by interacting with the land by just doing simple things like waking
up going to sleep walking sleeping every day under the sun and the moon and the stars
managed to start to form a relationship with uh what i might call the magnetic field the magnetic
field that surrounds my whole body and actually is sort of to some extent fed into by the earth and then
to some extent you interact with it with your own magnetic field back to the earth
um that actually doing this walk um made made it very clear to me that you reach certain states of
trance quite naturally by doing things like walking in a rhythmic pace breathing in a rhythmic pace
it can transport you into some quite unusual places and some quite healing places as well
um i got more and more interested in how these trance states could be used so i formally uh started
training in nlp and hypnosis um and then got involved with working magnetically uh about
oh gosh i'm starting to lose track now still probably about
uh about 2010 around about that time 2009 uh 2010 uh started getting involved in working magnetically
but to some extent this was the thing um i was already doing that um i was i was discovering that
i already had some kind of an ability to work magnetically especially with other people
um uh so yeah i i just got more and more involved in doing it as a as a as a profession
and how did that lead you to say for example your tours of the british museum which i think are kind
of like cult now like everyone knows you from these tours yeah well um i was living close to the british
museum uh for about eight years and i was regularly going in there every other day and just spending
time sitting around some of the uh some of the statues and some of the figures and started to notice
very similar to a lot of the other stuff that i've just described to you start to notice that some
of these objects had quite distinct and characteristic magnetic qualities which um ebb and flow with the
lunar cycles um so i kind of got a bit obsessed with going in there and checking all of these things out
and it wasn't just that i was able to stand in front of some of these things and they would literally
depart information impart information to me on on various different levels i was never interested in
the uh archaeological history of these things i was more interested in the way that the symbolism itself
just unfolds um if you if you can come into contact with these figures another thing i noticed was the
fact that a lot of these figures seem to be um carved in stone for perpetuity um so that we can actually
access some of the forms that they're making so for example some of the some of the stances that you
find them in like the stunts of pitar and so on so they're almost like saying do as we do try out
give it a go you know try out what we're doing and uh if you do you'll be pleasantly surprised
especially if you're working with present moment awareness in the process there's one object that i
remember you pointing out on our tour the libation bowl of hathor and that's something that i've become
quite obsessed with uh myself and i i remember the quality of it is amazing it's something i always go and
spend time with when i'm there and then um it has a kind of slightly throwaway descriptive tag which
a lot of the objects in the british museum do have because they haven't been updated very regularly
and one of the things that i realized about it recently because i learned um i started to learn
hieroglyphs during lockdown and i got very interested i mean you were my inspiration for starting to
properly study hieroglyphs because i found that tour of the british museum so eye-opening and i saw
everything very differently after that and i was desperate to be able to read some of the inscriptions
but understanding the kind of the essence of some of say like the um determinatives or some of the
like literal symbolic hieroglyphs that don't necessarily have a phonetic meaning
already revealed quite a lot but the hathor's libation bowl um is such a beautiful perfectly made
thing and it came to my mind recently because during explorers egyptology one of my lectures was on
mirrors the history of mirrors and uh we had an egyptologist joanne backhouse talk about mirrors
and symbolism of mirrors in ancient egypt and what strikes me about that libation bowl now is that
it's the glyph of this the solar disk it has a smaller circle in the center so i had an idea that
this could have been used and it could at least have had a double function of being a water mirror
because if it was filled with some sort of liquid i mean it says it's a libation bulb but that kind
of doesn't really mean anything it's just um an example of some sort of furniture but um i contacted
the british museum and i said something about the possibility that this could ever be used as a water
mural could be used for divination and the the curator there said that the egyptians didn't practice
hydromancy they didn't practice uh divination using water or oil or anything like that which
is kind of crazy because i'd also had a lecture from another egyptologist that was all about water
divination and the fact that obviously they did practice every conceivable form of divination
in egypt so it's very interesting how you get you know i've always been impressed and i think it's a
great thing that the british museum let people do that off-piste weird tours of the british museum and
that is free for everyone to go to you know despite the fact that they've obviously nicked most of their
stuff or paid a pittance for most of the stuff that they have in there the fact that it's free
is it's one saving grace i would say because it's certainly you know growing up in a working class
family i went i was in museums and art galleries all the time in london as a kid and it was like the
best education i ever had so um uh i always just remember you really pointing out hatha's bowl and the
fact that it had this like amazing feeling and resonance and every time i would go i would like
stand by it and and try to feel its energy somehow but is that something that you think reacts with
moon cycles as well absolutely absolutely i've tested it out um on numerous occasions um
going there on uh new moons going there on full moons and um and you definitely get a different level
of uh vibration coming from that bowl uh on those occasions i usually find it strongest at the new
moon uh less strong funnily enough at the full moon that's that's how i discovered and there was another
one i i don't know if you remember but there's another libation bowl quite similar to it and it
always in compare in comparison it always felt incredibly dead like there was just no nothing coming
from that bowl at all and it obviously isn't as perfect as the other one either it's uh it's quite
it's quite sort of misshapen and kind of a bit battered i think the one up by the offering tables
yeah the one the one up near the offering tables yes but that one like i was saying it it always felt
really dead i have to say in the last uh in the last year it seems to be coming back to life or it seems
that's interesting i was gonna go to the british museum a couple of days ago but the queue was the
biggest queue i've ever seen in my life the only time when i haven't gone because the queue's been
so big but i would have been waiting outside for like two hours in the rain um but i'll be interested
to try that out next time i see it i mean i think it's really interesting because we're so used to
things being made quickly and easily here it really hit me how the extra effort that's required to put
that small circle on the inside turns it into a glyph for the sun and in ancient egypt mirrors
were a symbol of rebirth they're often shown in postpartum scenes for example and they have this
relationship with dreams as well because dreams are often represented as being in this kind of
mirror realm and so it speaks a little to me also of an ancient egyptian concept of sort of
transmigration of the soul that a new soul is coming into life yeah so i mean the thing you
described about it being like a water mirror was actually was actually what i got myself when i
went there many many years ago like to the actual place i remember seeing like a group of a group of
in in a meditative vision that i had while standing there which happened happened to me with quite a
few of those um objects that particular one i know this uh you know to this this may sound a little
a little a little sort of out there to some people but um because it was a hathor mirror a hathor bowl
i actually um saw a group of priestesses using it to divine the life of a newborn baby washing the
afterbirth of a newborn baby so it was actually used as different divination with candlelight uh or oil
lamp you know lights uh in water actually looking at that between state divining uh the the the where
the where the childhood come from and where it may be going to that's interesting i have a similar idea
with regards to um the relationship that it probably had with birth because because that's a symbol that
you see in most postpartum scenes and hathor's obviously associated with protecting women in
labor and and things like this as well so these things are very difficult to talk about i mean like
um when when uh say for example we're describing some of the hieroglyphs um you know we look at
them and they're just two-dimensional but there's a certain state of mind that you that we need to get
ourselves into where we begin to see them beyond the two-dimensional representations uh because that's
actually what a lot of these things are trying to get at yeah i've thought a lot about this once i
when i started to learn hieroglyphs my sort of interest in the mysteries and my ideas about learning
to kind of embody or perceive these ancient perceptions shifted a lot because i think there is
something about a hieroglyphic writing system that has a almost holographic quality to it because
once you fully understand one glyph or you you know you approach understanding one glyph it presents
this kind of multi-dimensional view of everything and one of the things that i've considered is because
hieroglyphs are obviously representing real things of the world those people that were literate
in hieroglyphs would have seen configurations of certain real things in the world which would mean
the world was talking to them which could be absolutely of god so that's like an amazingly different
way of seeing the world before we came online lee and i were chatting about uh the ancient greek
language and the more i learn about and the more i study the sleep temples and the ancient greek religion
the more i recognize that the ancient greek language itself is fundamental to perceiving these things in
the way that they're meant to be perceived and maria marigou who's a researcher and author that i'm
working with in greece has spent her life studying like deep etymological studies of ancient greek texts
and she describes it as a cosmic codex that enables you to conjure up magic and to change reality and to
see things as they truly are and i think the more i was just said to lee that hanging out with a lot of
greek speakers and people that are really into ancient greek study makes me feel like english is german
because it seems too basic and too simple and the greek language seems to somehow express
the essence of things in a more effective way somehow i think because we obviously have so many
greek words in english um it's like getting to the source getting to the root of everything by
understanding the terms for things absolutely um just just while i'm thinking of this um are you aware
of the original greek theta what it looked like um i'm not sure what does the original greek theta look
like you're going to be pleasantly surprised this is what the original greek theta theta was
oh amazing right so if you then take the numerical uh numerical value of theta which is nine
but then you spell the word theta you end up with the same amount exactly the same value as elios
of course elios is the sun so the greek word theta takes you straight directly to the actual value of
elios itself of which it was the original glyph of wow yeah you spoke about how the greek letters
had numerical values and they were symbols to represent numerical values so that gives greek
this extra layer of complexity and it basically is the fabric of the universe and that's how maria
describes it she she's very um passionate about the ancient greek language well i mean like for example
i mean a lot of people you know know about uh kabbalah and uh the hebrew kabbalah and things like this
um and and and they even use terms like um gematria well gematria for a start is is a greek word so
gematria is literally related to the idea of the geometry the metric metric the measurement of gaia
so the gaia metria or the geometric so the whole idea is is that we've got here specific as as you say
there a matrix which is made from the numerical values of words and of course the ancient priests
used to know and the priestesses and all of the ancient um uh ancient uh hierarchies of
the priestly castes would basically utilize uh that whenever the formula of a god would change they
would change its spelling because its spelling would then reflect what they were trying to describe and
a classic example of that is is mithras so they changed the mithras from 360 and then stuck uh a
letter eta in there but is it eta eta yeah which equals five and then it became uh then it became mithras
with 365 to describe the new understanding of the 365 days that they were now willing to actually espouse to
um to the general public which uh originally in egypt that was the five forbidden days i do believe
wow um how do you think that hypnotism mesmerism magnetism fits into the practices at sleep temples
in the ancient world like i'll be interested to hear more about your idea about sleep temples in egypt as
well for example because imhotep often gets credited with being uh well he's synchronized with asclepius
um in some of the sleep temples in egypt but i was wondering what you made of that well i think i think a
lot of the feeling and the a lot of the feeling is that it has actually a lot of that tradition of the
sleep temples did derive from egypt to me um a lot of the rites and rituals that surround
uh the books of the dead to me are actually it seems quite clear to me
and of course these things cannot be proven but it's certainly something which you can
you can gain your own understanding of um by by actually going through uh sorry there's somebody
outside uh staring into into my car which is very it's very strange yeah so um anyway yeah so you've
got the you've got the whole thing with uh the way the temples are set up and of course if you've been to
egypt and you've been into the great pyramids and you've been into a lot of the other temples there's
a distinct feeling that these places were used not just for funerary rites by any stretch of the
imagination they were used very much as an initiatic chambers and um and i very much feel that uh that
some of these places were used for preparations in a similar way to the asclepian temple to the abaton
um i mean of course there's been a lot said about him imhotep in this regard as well well it seems
like imhotep is a divine physician and i think it's always interested me that he also has this role of
divine scribe because the relationship between uh magic medicine and writing is always so important in
ancient egypt and um imhotep is syncretized with asclepius like officially in the greco-roman
period and then in um in somewhere like the sanctuary of asclepius epidavros for example you
have the sanctuary of the egyptian gods there where you have syncretization between apollo a gear and
um asclepius and a gear isis uh horus and osiris yeah so there's something about the resurrection
which is another interesting thing to get onto because there's this close relationship in egypt and
in greece between uh death and sleep and i think the hypnotic trance state is this
this liminal space where death and and um sleep can be coerced in in some way so i wonder how you use
um hypnosis to influence the sleep process the dream content things like this well really i mean um
the point is i mean in if you're talking about the hypnagogic stuff uh being used to access
the hypnosis aspects of awareness that are not not usually accessed um we can begin to find answers to
questions so it can be used therapeutically in that way so we can begin to obviously like a good like
good meditation you can get into a very similar state um where you can access answers to questions
in a in a way that you just quite simply normally never would um and they can just pop pop straight
up into your mind or in a very clear and lucid way or they can come up in the form of a feeling or in
the form of an image there's many many multifarious ways that uh that these things can present themselves
to you um also another thing that i lead people to pay attention to is is also the feeling uh that
people get also to understand where they feel it because the of course the body registers things in
many different areas many different ways um so it's it's it's um all of this at the end of the day
when i'm using these things purely therapeutically it's just to help the client with a with an
immediate issue that they're dealing with um but i i also work in a much more sort of um initiatic way
as well and that's really the bit of my work that i can see taking place to the end of my life because
there's as you said at the beginning of this interview uh i think before some of some before
everybody joined us you you can never really see that ending it when we're navigating the path of
the soul basically that's what we're doing just navigating the path of the soul and um finding the
best way under the guidance of certain deities like higia obviously we want a very healthy process
we we also need uh apollo brings us you know harmony and and peace um so we want to invoke
these ideas or at least bring through petition bring these um qualities into our journey
while whenever we're opening a new door well i think there's something really useful and intelligent
about having a deity as a i think of it as almost being like a psychic target it gives you something
to direct your energy and your attention to you know and i think we you know there was this there's
this ancient idea that statues can really contain the living essence of a god or goddess and i love that
idea and i think that that perhaps is conjured up by human attention you know if we give form if we give
shape to these these ideas and these qualities of nature or these forces of nature and we sculpt them
into physical forms especially human tangible physical forms then we can we can direct our energy and
our attention and our love and adoration to them and they then a bit like a tulpa like uh you know
they can come alive and they can then have influence we've created something in the imagination that then
has a life and volition of its own so and you know this is why i think quite enough in ancient times
very often the ancient religions or people that practiced in ancient religions had this appreciation
that these things could be transferred these essences could be transferred from um osiris to mithras for
example or from dionysus to jesus and i think we spoke before we came online about one of the things
that attracts me so much to greece is i think the essence of nature worship is still preserved in greek
orthodoxy to some extent obviously greek orthodoxy isn't perfect but neither was paganism and uh maria
marigou did mention something to me about how the the hierophants the people who initiated people at the
mysteries of lfc for example they took the when the sites were being smashed up and and um demolished
by early christian fanatics they they were continuing to initiate people in plato's academy
and they preserved those rights and then because they had a high status in society they were able to
insert those rights and those rituals and those religions or those those um rituals into greek
orthodoxy so for example easter in greece is such a big deal it has this real kind of dionysian sense
and so many of the chapels especially the rural chapels and churches are um dedicated to the virgin
mary and very often that they have like special uh qualities of the virgin mary so it'd be like the
painless sleep or meaning the death the assumption of the virgin and so they're often still associated
with things like dream incubation as well i think the biggest um or the one of the earliest churches
in greece was actually built within the sanctuary of asclepius and it became famous for uh dream
miracles because there was always these overlapping of religions and cults kind of being aware that they
were essentially saying the same thing and so you could swap one face of a god for another and yeah
no one really um batted an eyelid so um i think that that's something that greased to me that current
of um ecstasy and nature adoring is still there and i think for me that is the biggest sense i get
spending time in elefcena as well actually is that uh if you ever go during springtime i'm sure you've been
at springtime when all the wild flowers are coming out yeah this sense that for rural agrarian
populations the emergence of spring would have just been ecstatic it's like orgiastic nature and
if you feel that you're part of the cycle of nature you feel orgiastic they call it the sacred
orgies as well and i think it's more than just um uh about sex it's about like the sex of the world
the sex of the cosmos and that there's a current that human beings are able to tap into and become
ecstatic yeah and and that's interesting using that word that word orgy um i mean the the actual
meaning of that word as well means the work the work the working the orgia is the is the is the
actual working itself so the working of nature or the great work again it's another one of those um
references um yeah so the uh the thing of the um how how to use this um is a very interesting question
because i like i say initiatically i like to use these things um to incubate the next phase of a question
uh which is interesting you know the word quest you're on the quest you're asking the question
it's you're setting out on the quest you're you're positing the question and uh of course like when we
read the tarot or when we do any kind of divination we usually have some form of a question that we need an
answer to but if you're actually uh working the sacred work you obviously need um you need answers
to certain or usually directives in some way or some kind of hint as to what you need to be looking
at next or what you need to be paying more attention to or the the stricture of rights themselves actually
allow you to pay attention uh to say for example i'll just give you a an off-the-cuff example here
but if say for example you light a certain amount of candles and you know that those candles represent
certain principles and you do a meditation with those particular candles if you know how a certain
candle is behaving then that candle can obviously give you the clue as to what it is that you're what
what's what you're being told while you're doing the meditation so if one of the candles for example
goes very very dim and very very small or is very very wavery and the rest of them are very still and
strong and you know the significance of that particular candle then you'll you're you're doing
divination immediately in the process of um of working with the strictures of a right for example um so
but then of course taking the dreaming you're saying the dreaming it can take on another level
where whereby when you go into some of the deeper works where you're completely deprived of
any light whatsoever that you actually begin to dream with your eyes open of course because you're
looking straight into the uh into the dark and when you're doing this then uh then of course you
can you can form dialogues while while apparently still awake with things which come to say for example
visit you or you can start speak you can begin to start seeing something emerging um these things
are very difficult to talk about well you're in the right place you can begin to get an idea of what
good yeah so this is basically in my understanding this is precisely what they were doing in the in the
abaton because they were the the particular area of the abaton they were prepping people for uh for a period
of time almost like in a hospital bed type situation where they would uh immerse them um in tasks like
reading about a particular deity immersing themselves in the literature of that particular deity immersing
themselves in uh repetitive types forms of prayer or whatever um and i get a very strong feeling that
this was all done on lunar cycles in strict accordance with lunar cycles and one of the uh one of the most
powerful lunar cycles of all is the lunar cycle between um between libra right through to capricorn
um that particular quadrant uh or should i say that those those four forming a nice uh inside the 360
degrees of a zodiac they're forming a nice 90 degree angle those four from libra to capricorn is where all of
the initiatic stuff happens and through time and history um that's very much being the case because
of course you have the epiphania epiphania in the capricorn well that's interesting because doesn't
that also correspond with orpheus as a constellation as well because he is he that's the representation of
asclepius in the heavens absolutely absolutely there you go absolutely that and of course you get the
you get the judgment in the libra and you get the resurrection uh or the birth of the light in capricorn
you know you mentioned um meditating on some of the objects in the british museum and i had a similar
situation because i spend a lot of time at the sanctuary of asclepius when i take my retreat
guests there so as i was saying to you before we started it's like it feels like home to me now i'm
there so often always having a little lie down in the avaton and what i love about it is that the staff
the the whistleblowers are pretty much only orientated around the theater and a bit in the museum but once
you get into the bigger wider sanctuary because the theater was a huge important part of treatment in
the asclepia because theater was seen as divine it was an art of dionysus and dionysus is a god of kind
of purging and ecstasy and you could go through a process of catharsis by watching an emotional um
drama being played out in this theater and you have to think of theaters i think as temples as shrines
like something divine transformative happens in them so but when tourists get dropped off at the
sanctuary of asclepius now they just get dropped off at the great theater they might spend 10 or 20
minutes in the museum and then that's it and then there's this whole vast sanctuary um just beyond
that that is where the the bath houses were where the various temples to different gods were and where
this um dormitory where people would go to sleep and have sacred sleep or divine dreams and so i've
been very interested in this idea of sacred sleep and enkimesis what it actually means and looking at
it entomology entomologically uh enkimesis means something like being put to sleep in a particular
place so there is the act of falling asleep or being put to place in a put to sleep in a particular
place and the place is important because obviously something is anticipated by sleeping in a particular
place yes i think this idea of divine dreaming and sacred sleep is something that's super ancient
that stone age people were doing they were sleeping yeah absolutely to contact the the the spirit of the
the earth and and it eventually became more and more complex and as we were saying when we were
talking beforehand um the entire sanctuary of asclepius which is a very sophisticated holistic
healing sanctuary and i don't think you can overstate how holistic it was it had libraries gymnasiums
but bath houses of every kind like great food uh there were diet regimens organized for people
and the divine dream was the kind of um culmination of all of this work done to get the body in a
healthy state as possible to receive this information from the god so i i slept on this as well and um
in my dream i was in the i was in the avaton and in my dream i had this understanding that there was
the avaton which was where they actually performed surgeries and where you only went if you were having
a surgery because obviously they were we know they were performing actual surgeries because we found
scalpels and needles and all of the kind of gen genuine surgeon gear that you would associate with
actual surgeries and operations and there were records of surgeries happening even sex changes and
things like this so um the avaton in my dream was where they they did all these secret things the
physicians were actually performing these physical operations that the ordinary members of the public the
ordinary pilgrims weren't to see so the avaton means a place that no one can go into it's like the sacred
inner sanctum but it means you can't tread there you no one can tread there you can't step foot upon
in this sacred place and then the enki materion is the place where you would go to sleep and have your
divine dreams of asclepius and uh one of the people i've been talking to is a classicist and philologist was
saying that he thinks enki messes describes this idea of sacred sleep describes um sleep the kind
of quality of sleep that you have when you are put under anesthetic and it's the groggy uh visions
and hallucinations that you have as you're waking up and they're almost certainly using anesthetics in
the asclepia i would say because um the use of things like mandrake dine dial now poison right
us has been well known since the ancient near east so but in my dream let's get back to that uh one of the
things that we shouldn't rule out or shouldn't forget about when we think about the sanctuary
of asclepius is that these serpents were allowed to roam freely around and they were considered to
be the animal form of the god serpents and dogs were the animal form of asclepius and um in my dream
uh the serpents were trained serpents and they could smell you and they could smell where there were wounds
or diseases on you and in most of the imagery that you see from the sanctuaries the serpents do look
very friendly they look very tame and they're all over you and i could i was having this experience
as being a dream pilgrim of that time that that attention that you're receiving from the serpents
gives them this extra sense of consciousness awareness of divinity because they're interested
in me they wouldn't a snake would normally be scared of a human but these snakes are all over you
and smelling you and snakes do have extraordinary um olfactory capabilities even more so than dogs they
have this thing called a jacobson's organ on the roof of their mouth so they they're breathing in
um like complex smells and are able to identify billions of different smells and so i think it
would be quite sensible that you would have trained serpents i mean there was an extra bit of my dream
you're talking about there was an extra bit of your dream where um the priests in my dream were feeding
the serpents slithers of organs that they'd cut out of some of their patients if that was real but
in the dream it was saying that this was somehow uh transmuting the illness of the patient and
making it good and whole by being absorbed by the god but anyway i think it's really um interesting to
sleep and dream on these things and i always when if there's something i'm puzzling over or i have
a query about these practices in ancient times that's my favorite activity to do because like you say we
never really know but it's interesting to try to access ideas in altered states and dreams are the
perfect place to do this especially absolutely and and i do feel that um you know being being inspired by
a vision while sitting looking at a piece of art or sitting looking at a statue or sitting looking at
a particular carving or a place even even purely natural places natural settings um these these
are not not to be passed by these are not experiences to be passed by they're no less meaningful than the
the the things you would get in actual what you might call actual dream what you might what people
think of as ordinary dream state where we have a lot of symbolism taking place there's a lot of things
that can come to us like like for example standing at the um the hathor bowl for example and uh the
things that i that came to me there many other places um yeah they're not things to be just uh taken
lightly uh they're they're by themselves they're they there's a lot of symbolism there a lot of really
useful symbolism that tells you a lot so i really like what you've just said about the snakes definitely
well i think there's also something about great art you know this idea of being struck by the muse in
ancient greece as well i find very interesting and my muse my patron goddess is menemosini and i think
because she's the mother of all of the muses and she's described as a personification of divine
remembrance she's kind of a psychopomp in the orphic tradition and she to me is the personification of
lucidity because she's remembering yourself in the in the great dream and there's a kind of
inspiration and ecstasy that comes to you in a dream that i think menemosini is the muse of she's
the muse of that kind of inspiration which we've kind of ironically forgotten about so uh the fact that
she was such an important goddess as well in the sleep temple traditions quite often is significant i think
and she also represents this you know her her opposite is lethe the goddess of oblivion the
goddess of forgetting and i think there's something to be said though like hypnosis is a great example of
this relationship between lethe and menemosini i think because if you look at the oracle of trophonius
for example it was this uh last resort oracle that people would visit uh if they had a problem or they
wanted to know something but there's something interesting for me about the fact that to drink
the waters of oblivion first and there's something that reminds me of hypnosis in that especially if
you're you're practicing hypnosis in order to absolutely feel someone of a phobia they need to
forget their patterns and their programming before and remember like that divine source and the the divine
nature of their being right yeah absolutely and so and so in a similar way to isis and the function of
isis in the remembering of osiris you know that's the namazani type of view as well you know it's like
that's the function of the goddess um piecing back that which is scattered you know gathering it all back
together again which is forming a holism again which is which is the very meaning of the healing that takes
place so by actually forming that by bringing the healing that's necessary the trajectory of the soul
remembers where it's from and that's the point is that we we are fragmented uh humanity the state of
ordinary humanity is generally fragmented and in great pain as a result of the forgetting
and the fragmentation um is actually another way to look at it is the fact that it's yeah it's this
state of blindness that the majority of the human race are in while they're desperately trying to
remember their uh their divine source yeah i guess i mean the mysteries of elefcena are often described as
you know dying before you die and releasing that fear of death and there are some initiatory qualities
definitely within the sanctuary i think the the sacred sleep the divine dreaming itself is a form
of initiation and if you look at so the the kind of companion sometimes described as the son of
asclepius is tell us for us and he is bringer of fulfillment and he represents completion of the cure
and it is like you say this return to wholeness this perfecting of the human organism and the human
soul and i guess that that this is what's missing from the nhs really isn't it this concept
they could do with thinking in a much more holistic way like i think that um understanding that beauty
can have a healing effect is so important and when you do visit the site say the sanctuary of asclepius
and any of these asclepius because there were so many there's like 400 in the ancient greek world like
across um europe there's even a sleep temple in england in uh gloucestershire that there's this
appreciation for beauty and these sites were always chosen because they had a lot of natural beauty they
had natural water there was this uh hellenic understanding of feng shui i think you know that
these things have an effect and you look at some of the structures at the sanctuary of asclepius as
well for example the simeli the the great tholos that was built they're the most expensive building
ever built in the peloponnese is exquisitely built like it's extremely beautiful and i think like you
say beauty and inspiration and appreciating great art is connecting somehow to this divine resonance because
those great works of art or those great um efforts of incredible craftsmanship they were made by
inspired people and when inspired people make things you feel in your body and soul and that can
heal you and um so i think you know music is obviously very important and the arts were very
important in the sanctuary of asclepia there would have been great art competitions and drama competitions and
the the mysteries of elefcena incorporated asclepius into the greater mysteries they had the feast of
asclepius day so it was recognized that some your sick self died basically in the yeah and yourself was
reborn right yes exactly and and that's uh like we were saying you know the apollonian type of invocation to
to bring that energy in is to is to re-harmonize and and to bring temperance back into the being and
that's uh that's basically you know re-establishing the principle of mart in the old egyptian uh
theology so yeah bringing that back again you know interesting you mentioned mark and i think there's
also something about when you create because the impression the feeling that i get when i go to the
sanctuary of asclepius is that it's a divine um enclosure it's a sacred precinct it's encircled by
the sacred grove and there's something about once you pass through that sacred grove you're in divine
territory and everything there is perfect and in ancient times you can imagine that everything was
perfect the buildings were perfect the waterways were perfect the water was perfectly clear and pure
there was harmonious music playing there were uh therapeutic there were treatments to get you back to
full health um and there's something about that that reminds me of that i think it was like a
experiment in addiction where you put rats into an environment that's enriched and full of beautiful
things and nice food and healthy things and uh entertaining games and they will give up being
addicted to crack or whatever the scientists have put them on because that's what scientists do
and you know i think it's true that if you're in a beautiful harmonious environment you become more
beautiful and harmonious and i think that ancient people understood that and perhaps that comes from
this uh less egotistical individualistic way of seeing the world because if you place any organism
into a beautiful environment then you tend to calibrate somehow to that environment because there's
always interaction and conversation and communication happening between the different organisms and the
organizational forces in that space so i think that that is something that ancient greeks were
consciously trying to do when they were creating these healing sanctuaries i couldn't agree more i couldn't
agree more yeah there's definitely that sense of it um yeah definitely that sense of it yeah and another
thing another thing another thing as well is um at uh alephsis um when i was there the last time it was so
clear to me that when you see all of the different elements of the space you know you've got the cave of
hades you've got the uh the colicron is it colicron the well i don't know how you say the colicron well
where uh where you had demeter um and persephone uh and then you've got uh the telesterion over there
and everything everything in the immediate zone is literally no more than you know a minute's walk
from each each place so there's this incredible feeling that there was just a huge psychodrama
that would have happened in that immediate space and all of those spaces were used by actual people
going through those um reenacting those those myths basically yeah i think it's one of my favorite
archaeological sites there because one thing that i think is really interesting that i noticed they
haven't done in a lot of the um archaeological sites is they've maintained the sacred way so the
way that you enter the archaeological site is along the original sacred way amazing sense of entering it
so when you enter the asclepia you enter it in a completely wrong place but there's something about
elefcena that you enter it on the same the right way pilgrim would have done and i love that and you
you get this immediate sense like you know where you're going like the flow through the space is
incredible yeah yeah absolutely absolutely so yeah um all of these all of these places still have
a hell of a lot to give to us that's absolutely for certain and how do you think you know does
mesmer claim that mesmerism is deriving from ancient egyptian practices of magnetism
well no i don't think mesmer claimed that um but in my opinion from seeing plenty of evidence of uh
egyptian you know the centers there was a very strong um emphasis upon actual centers within the human body
which are there within certain glowing disks which are placed in certain statues or in the say for
example the body of newt often has these centers there's also another image that i have where you
have isis ziris and horus and they're all um in a line and they're do they're doing the usual egyptian
uh postures but those egyptian postures we we think of them often as like oh there there is the priest you
know doing a or the priestess doing uh an act of worship but it's very often overlooked that they're
actually in the magnetic in the posture of magnetic transmission you know it's it's it's really clear
to me also when you see them uh magnetizing the specific centers in the body in some of these images
it becomes even more clear you know they're working with very specific centers in some of these images
well i think the west in exact for example like peter kingsley talks a lot about um there being uh
a tradition not unlike indian sages transmitting wisdom that happened for hellenic philosophers but that
it kind of got lost and there's a tradition where healing really is similar to what we might look at
when we look at shamanic healing actually looks very similar to shamanic healing and that there
was an idea of chakras or energy centers within the body in ancient greece but that those things because
they're represented different um don't get recognized as being chakras or don't get recognized
i mean even with um egyptian concepts of the heart is quite interesting because the heart is seen as
the seat of the soul it encloses the car and the bar it's where the intellect resides even and i think
the ancient egyptian word translates as something like skull awful they knew that the brain did stuff
they knew that the brain was important and if anyone had a brain injury they knew that they couldn't do
certain things because they had a brain injury but they didn't see it as being like the seat of
emotions or the seat of inspiration and ideas or love they saw the heart as as being more important
there and then you have um this concept of union as well in uh in ancient egypt this the you know the
smart tower uh hieroglyph that shows the heart and windpipe uh entwined and and there's this i guess
like there's a concept in egypt similarly as there is in greece of this ideal person you know this
harmonized person usually a man but there's a harm there's a sense of like a harmony of um the the
forces within a person and usually the ideal man is humble it's the same in egypt as it is in greece
that the ideal man is a humble person and that he has his tempers in check and the that can be achieved
it seems like it's achieved through some form of meditation or some form of uh non-ordinary
prac you know practice of an exercise in consciousness yeah absolutely yes yes well again
once once again it's um it's very much about consciousness itself and conscious awareness
um i think we we just got a uh a message yeah i'm gonna um ask anyone if they want any questions at
this point as well yes that might be quite good uh lucerne said are there any written sources where
we can read up on the sleep temples and possibly even the connection with mesmer
um right okay um to my knowledge um i haven't come across any external satisfactory materials where
we can learn about the actual sleep temples other than it mentioned scattered throughout a few a few
different books there have been books written on hypnosis um i can't remember unfortunately can't
remember the name of those at the moment uh where the asclepian sleep temples are mentioned
and also uh this connection we're talking about with imhatep so i'm pretty sure if you do a google
search or something on on the internet you'll come across which books feature this material quite easily
yeah sorry there's a few books on sleep temples that jill renberg wrote a kind of exhaustive
tome that costs about 500 uh quid but you can get a pdf of it online and that looks at evidence
across the greco-roman world for any sleep temple ever um where dreams may come i can send out anyone
who wants to know like a reading list of anything that relates to dream temples because i've tried to
find everything but i as far as i'm aware as well there's nothing that links mesmer and sleep temple
practices no um i think i think the most uh interesting thing is um is the fact that through
the pythagorean tradition uh mesmer is more closely related to the pythagorean tradition than people think
so um so you have the um the whole idea of the harmony in fact his his own society was called the
society of harmony so he was working with that whole idea of harmonization with the apollonian
principles and uh and and actually to to a large extent um the pythagorean tradition also
had connections with the therapeutae yeah so they they were very very closely linked
uh never mind the fact that actually pythagoras was supposed to have brought the knowledge from
egypt originally as well um stephan asked the uk sleep temple is in lidney park yes lidney park in
gloucestershire dedicated to the god nodans that's it was worked on by uh tessa and mortimer wheeler were
the archaeologists working on it and they were assisted by tolkien who used it as inspiration for
writing lord of the rings yeah that's right it's on like a private estate that is only open for a couple
of weeks out of the year for a rhododendron festival lidney park estate uh what darren says what is the
most important single practice we can implement to learn to sense magnetic energy and or experience
waking dream experiences and where can we learn about this okay so um i myself do specialist courses in
precisely these techniques um the the next one i have on is on the let me see the 25th to the 30th of
october this year that will be taking place in glastonbury and if you go to www.arkana therapies.com
so that's all one word arkana therapies.com uh you'll see more information about that course
and how to book onto it um so with with regards to these techniques it's very much um based in the uh
uh i'll just answer that question seeing as it's popped up yes i still do british museum tools you can
go on arkana events.com and you can book onto those um yeah so as i was saying the the the actual uh
way you actually enter into this energy is through present moment awareness so we do a lot of training
in present moment awareness and once that we've actually started charging and supercharging the
energy it's then very easy to start using it so that's uh that's very much what it is and also we can
find that it has a great um amplifying effect upon our relationship to other things in the natural
landscape and with other bodies other bodies of any kind other people animals trees rocks springs
and so on you know this reminds me a little bit of actually i remember one of our early interactions
i was reading knowledge of the higher wells by rudolph steiner oh yes yes uh one of the exercises in
that and this reminds me a lot of what you're saying about energy emanating from things is to
identify the energy that are coming from living and dead things and you become sensitive to yes
things that are dead and things that are living or have a charge and it becomes very strong after a
while and i was trying to explain to someone what the sense is because you just do this practice where
you sit with something say a plant that's very obviously alive and a plant that's very obviously
dead and you feel the difference in the energetic field of it and then you become more sensitive to
it and you're able to like walk down a street for example one of the things i noticed was that
um if you're walking down a street where some people have gardens and some people have drives
it's like alive alive alive dead dead dead alive alive and you you the feeling is like um it's a
sensation but i would describe the sense as being quite close to hearing it's like really it's an
interesting because he talks as well about cultivating your sensory your organs of sensory perception
which i found really interesting so and he talks about um you know the more you cultivate these
organs the more you're able to see these different spiritual realms i love the way that steiner writes
about these things i mean his he was a real uh visionary i think in terms of he had this absolute sense of
how to communicate these things to people and and exactly what he wanted to say
do you think that um the experience of sensing magnetism is that something similar to that very
much very very much yes and uh like i say from doing certain exercises um you can begin to come into
direct contact with that very very quickly so it's uh it's something that i kind of i'm quite i'm quite
directive with people when we do courses and i make sure i keep an eye on every single person
so that um i can keep giving them the necessary prods that they need to to stay completely conscious
of what's happening to them in all the time so we just keep driving that process until eventually
you begin to you begin to feel it will says how can hypnosis best be used to enhance one's lucid dream
practice right well um there's the famous famous uh castanadas find your hands in a dream um technique
now of course i mean you can reinforce with uh with what i call traditional hypnosis which is usually
involving non not non-verbal but verbal suggestions such as uh tonight i will find my hands in a dream
tonight i will find my hands in a dream it will be easy and natural for me to do so and um you know
you just basically make suggestions before you go to bed you might even just sit sit there on a park
bench one day when you've got a few relaxing minutes to yourself and just take a few deep breaths and just
repeat to yourself um tonight i will find my hands in a dream in the beginning when i was doing lucid dreaming
i found this to be the most simple straightforward really super simple method um it took a little
while maybe a couple of weeks but as soon as i as soon as i literally found my hands in the dream i you
know so i will find my hands in the dream i will look at my hands and when i see my hands i will know
that i am dreaming and i will say to myself i know that i am dreaming
once that you've done that i'll give you one example of a time when that happened to me
um i was grabbing hold of a rock i was grabbing hold of a very very hard bristly rock it seemed
like some sort of bubbly volcanic rock with lots of sharp edges so it was even going as far as to say
i'm really making it so obvious that this material underneath your hands is like painful for you to
hold and as i was doing it i'm actually looking at my hands gripping the rock and i'm actually properly
beginning to observe my hands and then as a result of that you start to look around you and you can
change colors you can start to mess around with like different parameters of colors and sizes of things
and once that you're on that trajectory if you can keep that going then you can enter into
some really really quite fun spaces i think we're always kind of hypnotizing ourselves in terms of
uh programming our dream content it's about making conscious decisions about what you want in there
have a lot of people come to my dream things that watch loads of horror movies and then they're like
oh i don't know i have nightmares all the time but you know the more the things that i always i always say
watch um holy mountain jodorowsky's holy mountain of course of course yes it's a psycho magic quest
through the major arcana and you it's just perfect dream fodder it's so graphic so colorful so visually
like um uh extraordinary that you just can't help but process that you in your dreams and i have thought
that you know a lot of these psycho dramas that would have happened at lfc or at the sanctuary of
asclepius may have been processed most deeply in the dream state because that is the dream food the
experiences that we have in our everyday waking life the statues of the gods can come alive in our
dreams and they will come alive in our dreams because if we're seeing serpents writhing around
on the floor we're likely to incorporate them into our dreams at some point and one of the um
i mean i use uh i use a form of sleep hypnosis a guided hypnagogic meditation when i take people to
the sanctuary of asclepius to imagine themselves in that place in ancient times and to try to seed
hypnagogia with some of these symbols and images and ideas of the god and obviously it works very
effectively if you're actually there but um i think that one of the things that is really good as a
practice is that learning to expand extend and become more aware of hypnagogia so that you can
you can navigate it and find yourself in a dream proper without ever really losing consciousness
like i always describe it like alice falling down the hole in falling down the rabbit hole in alice in
wonderland like you're kind of drifting through hypnagogia and the dream is the corridor at the bottom of
the tunnel and um one of the things that i think works really well as well and and it's something
that i think was incorporated into a lot of ancient oracles is any um sounds of nature that form this
kind of background from which um you can start to hear murmurings and sounds like running trickling
water oh yes good you can start to hear oracles if you listen to trickling water or you listen to some
kind of hubbubby noise in the background there's something about it that seems to provoke um it's
a bit like a kind of audio version of pareidolia when you start to see faces in things you start to
hear voices sometimes when i do yoga nidra and i use a recording to do yoga nidra the voice in the
recording turns into like a dream dialogue and i'm conscious of the fact that there's this yoga nidra
audio track that i'm listening to but there's also this dream dialogue that's happening simultaneously
and it's like my brain is making new forms out of this background material absolutely very very good
to you uh you mentioned about uh making things out of say for example uh there's one really interesting
event that happened to me a couple of years ago i was actually it was about three years ago i was
actually in germany and uh i was literally out in the bavarian mountains just decided to do a little
bit of divination on a map where would be a really important place to go where is a where is where is
a particular place that will act like a bit of a portal you know that we can start to access something
so did a little bit of divination over the map and lo and behold this one place kept the the
pendulum kept getting drawn to this one place and then uh selected the part because it was a paper map
and then went into google earth and got closer and closer and found the actual place that it was pointing
to was a place um called calder brunnen calder brunnen which meant which means in german means um cold spring
and i thought all right so it's actually landed on a cold spring so uh in reality going to this
particular place and then walking up through these through these mountain tracks got completely lost
i didn't know but then the pendulum said out of these forks this way so went this way um and ended
up coming across this strange little sort of stack of bricks in the middle of a absolutely perfectly
natural place where a stack of bricks looked completely out of place but it was a well cover
on on on the side of a really steep tall bavarian mountain and um and i i could sit on the top of
this well and you could hear the waters underneath and the sunlight was uh the wind was blowing in the
trees and it gave you that sort of dappled uh breezy light over your eyelids and then you had all of the the
sound of the wells in stereo and as you sat there it sounded started to sound like chime bars and then
it turned into these amazing amazing visions of like literally like uh double helixes in in golden
and fiery golden light you know and then the sounds were in stereo it starts to sound like an angelic choir
wow so it really was quite an incredible place and um there was another peculiar thing that happened at
that particular point where for a period of at least um an hour afterwards it felt like the world
like it felt like the world was upside down somehow yeah i mean it's it's interesting to me like how
easy it can be to access these altered states especially if you take away the distractions of
modern life i think that one issue so many people have is addiction to devices or looking at their phones
or feeling like they're a slave to their clock or their calendar and you know healing occurs when
you're removed from these environments like i always joke with the people that come on my retreats
they're held in the healing lands of asclepius and it's amazing how people will recover from things
that have played to them for ages and i think the biggest part of it is just removing them from a noisy
distracting world and like you know yourself epidavros is incredibly quiet incredibly still
and i have thought as well because it's uh you know greece is quite volcanic and i think in these
countries where you feel volcanic energies pulses in the earth much greater sense of the earth as being
a living being totally the sense of the you know the the tide coming in and out as being a breath and a pulse
and it's so much it's so much more tangible in those volcanic places and i think this is part of
the reason why so much philosophy and so much wisdom comes from these countries that are volcanic is
because they have this much more first-hand experience of the earth being a living being
that was sustaining them through heat through water through life yeah
uh right sam says there are many occult schools where the practitioner beams some sort of astral
influence into someone's aura is there anything that make anything that makes mesmerism unique in this
regard like how might it differ from say something like shakti pap that's quite you know like this guru
transmission well i mean what you're doing here really if you're doing mesmerism proper is you're actually
you're actually first of all you're in yourself working with the principles of harmonization so you you work
on the harmonization of the self energetically and once that you've actually you're able to reach that
state in the self as you as you work with the other you begin to become very sensitive to what needs
balancing and what needs adjusting in the other person you're not beaming an astral influence
into the other person you're literally forming a lemnis gap between the other and you're actually
forming an ability to form a harmonization or bring the other the other individual into a greater sense
of present moment awareness which of itself is a is a sense of healing because we we're actually
disconnected from ourselves most of the time or we're too much in our minds or too much in our thoughts
not actually grounded and rooted in the body receiving the information that the body gives to
us uh you know so because it may sound trite to say but the body speaks to us all the time
you know and we need to we need to spend more time listening to it you know we live in a world where
we would rather override what the body's telling us than to listen to it and do what's appropriate for
example you know we we push ourselves too hard often and so what we're doing is we're um we're
harmonizing the other we're not we're not necessarily transmitting something into them although that can
be done you know you can use it that way you can implant things in another person if you want to work
that way but mesmerism proper just that isn't what it is so how do you experience say for example a
treatment on someone do you have any kind of is there any visual phenomena is it a feel is it a felt
sense how do you experience it well actually uh there's one really good example of uh one particular
individual uh who came to one of my courses once who i was sitting in the break i think it was after
the first day of the course beginning and we were sitting drinking a cup of tea together and as i was
speaking to him um i i knew virtually nothing about his work nothing about his background anything like
this and suddenly started to feel a kind of pricking sensation down towards the left hand side of my
throat at the base of my neck um and i said to him and it just gave me the immediate impression that i
have to say to him look um sorry to have to stop you here but i'm getting this pricking sensation at the
bottom of my neck and he just looked at me and said that's incredible he said i've been trying to work on
that particular point and i'm an acupuncturist and i've been working on that particular point for
years trying to get it right and he got like some sort of um throat problem that he'd been working on
as well and uh other other forms of uh emotional blockage that he'd been working on and uh during
that particular session we we worked on it really really quickly and got it all cleared out so in answer
to that question sometimes you get very very strong physiological sensations that tell you exactly
what's happening like for example you in yourself you may get like a very very strong sense of tension
in your solar plexus that tells you that you have to rebalance that within yourself and then send it out
to the other and then get that so that it forms part of the lemniscat again and you you actually get like
that energy flowing between the two and it becomes like a pulse so it's kind of like a like a feedback
mirroring system in some sense that if you were to you know by being in their physical presence you
start to experience their sensations and by yes taking them on you can transmute them somehow yes yes and
and i know that a lot of people in a lot of other healing therapies would say oh my gosh you know you're
going to be taking on a lot of the other person's problems you're going to be taking on a lot of the
other person's uh imbalances and so on um and of course you can if you wish uh you know do all the
traditional cleansing uh methods um but a practitioner that's really been working for a long time and has
actually been working very hard and very sufficiently on their work um working with present moment
awareness that itself is like is actually the harmonizing element and can actually override any
needs to do any of those cleansing exercises
that's amazing really interesting do these things tend to have like knock-on effects to sleep quality and
dream quality because i imagine that they they may do yes yes and this is interesting this is
interesting this has been a constant source of fascination uh for me and also something which
i deliberately on occasions work in a different way because there are times when i um there are times
when i deliberately want to enter the dream world more than i do at other times and there are times
when i know that the dream the dream world is not necessarily the place that's going to get me where
what i need for that particular uh point in time either so what i mean is like for example if you're
working a lot with present moment awareness it tends to evaporate your dreams
dreams because when you're when you're working a lot with dreams you tend to you tend to be going
more into the emotions and your emotional responses to things and then your internal visions grow
and uh your connection to these internal visions grow um and it tends to be very emotional because it's
very linked to the lunar body it's very linked to of course the lunar body has different levels
but it's it's linked to the lunar body especially to the emotional part of the lunar body which is the
vegetative aspect of the self when you're dealing with present moment awareness you're actually going
more into the electrical bioelectrical field than you are into the magnetic lunar field
so the lunar field tends to be more of the magnetic aspect linked of course to the car
and um to some extent as well uh on its lower level linked to the uh the animal body or the nefesh as
they say as they call it in the cabala
so sometimes you need to come into contact with that sometimes it's absolutely necessary on other
occasions it's uh it's appropriate depending on what kind of work you're doing to evaporate it
so this is where it becomes quite alchemical because sometimes you're trying to you know
you're trying to work in a more wet way sometimes you're trying to work in a more dry way
great uh does anyone else have any questions we've been going on for a while now so um
thank you so much lee by the way it's been brilliant it's been so nice to chat to you again
yeah well i feel i oddly feel like i'm only just getting jack i know we should well let me know when
you're going to do a british museum thing because i'll be up for coming and then also come and see
me in my peach bungalow in greece as well i'd love to see you in epidavros it'd be amazing yes of course
course of course yes great okay oh darian fantastic thank you um so uh thank you sarah my pleasure as
always great okay well um i've recorded this so i will uh share it with you lee and share it with
anyone else that wants to view it but thank you so much we touched on loads of different subjects there
and we went into some areas that i wasn't anticipating we would go but never mind oh that's
good okay thank you so much it was brilliant bye now cheers bye bye everyone
