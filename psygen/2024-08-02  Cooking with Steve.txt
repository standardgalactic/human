What are we having for dinner Steve at three o'clock in the morning? What are we having?
What's on the menu?
Folet mignon and some old frozen fries.
Okay, let's take a look at these fries. Oh yeah, this is the shit, people.
Look at this. We're talking goldmine here.
This stuff has probably been in the freezer for, you know, 12 or 13 years.
You can see that it's dehydrated, right, because it's got ice crystals all over the surface.
That's how you tell, by the way, if things are dehydrated.
Okay, and we got some filet mignons here, but they're pretty, you know, they got like no label and shit on them, right?
This could be from Russia. This could be from China. You have no idea where the fuck this came from.
You follow me? All right, so we're going to have filet mignon, and we're going to what? Fry the french fries?
Is that true?
Yes, sir.
In oil? In actual oil, or how are you going to fry them?
I'm going to fry them in olive oil, like they should be.
Olive oil? Wow, okay.
Now, olive oil has a low burn point.
Well, I don't have any peanut oil, so we're going to work with it.
What about vegetable oil?
What about butter?
I mean, lots of shit gets fried in butter.
You want to burn?
You don't have to burn the butter to fry the potatoes.
No, you don't.
No, you don't.
I know it's Stockton and everything, but there's a much broader array of possibilities there.
So, what kind of spices are going to go onto the fillets when you finally manage to get them out of the package?
And I'm really curious how you're going to avoid getting blood all over everything, because those packages are full of blood.
Have you got a plan for that?
No, I really haven't thought it through.
Okay.
You've got a lot of pressure going on.
Yeah, well, you're on camera here, bro.
Turn that fucking thing off.
It's three o'clock in the morning, and who knows who's watching you?
It could be the world.
Nobody's watching.
Here, let's have a look in the fridge.
Okay, we got some pudding, some bread.
What do we got?
Chocolate milk.
There you go.
Celery.
What are you doing with those puddings?
That shit right around.
I'm going to hand one to you to give to Julie.
She's asleep.
I'm not going to wake her up.
We got some, what is that?
Italian dressing, Worcestershire sauce, steak sauce, Tabasco, mustard, pickled, carrots.
Why are you recording my fridge?
Because people want to know.
Like, the world needs to know exactly what goes on in the house of other people.
Yeah, that's why social media is, like, going nuts.
All right, we got here some pickled ginger.
Okay, I'm kind of into that shit.
That shit's good.
Chicken base.
What's this crap?
Oh, some serious Mediterranean butter.
We got some lemon juice, some vinegar, eggs.
By the way, these are cage-free eggs, people.
Just want you to know, cage-free.
Trying to be good people.
Trying to be humans.
Why are you fucking kidding me?
Oh, he's saving space.
He's doing the safe-saving.
What are you smoking?
The safe, excuse me, the space-saving algorithm here by pulling the puddings out of their boxes.
All right, so what kind of spices are going to go on the, by the way, you're burning your pan there.
Is that hot enough?
I think the pan is burning.
No, I don't think it's burning.
I think it's just right.
What kind of spices are going to go on the filet mignon?
Well, here.
Lard?
Oh, my God, really?
By the way, there's a nearby city called Manteca, which is literally just named Lard.
There's literally a city in the central San Joaquin Valley that is called Lard.
Now, why would you use Lard instead of butter?
Because I would just straight up use butter.
Well, because Lard is from the beef cow.
Okay.
You just do it.
So you got a beef?
Is that what you're trying to tell me?
Well, we're doing steak, right?
We're doing steak?
Uh-huh.
Are we doing steak or no?
Yes, we are.
Okay.
Well, so we got some Lard.
So we got some fat.
Same stuff.
This is what this is.
Very simple.
I see.
So there's a correspondence here.
No, it's not correspondence.
It's called Lard.
You know, and back in the old days, we used to call it Lard.
You know, it's just.
No shit.
It was just.
You don't say.
You know, it's funny.
It's kind of like Crisco.
It is kind of like Crisco.
Only this is the real thing.
Yeah, I know.
That's the kind of shit that.
Not Crisco.
That I avoid like the plague, but I'm all ready to learn something new here.
Yeah, you're not going to eat this.
I might not.
No, you're not.
But I'm going to enjoy the process of creating it.
Because.
What are you doing there?
You're trying to.
Trying to get that off.
Get that last piece off the spatula.
That's right.
I got you.
You got it.
Look at that golden light in the liquefied lard.
Mantica.
Mantica.
Don't be confused here, people.
We're going to mantica together.
Are you going to be okay with eating lard with your filet mignon?
I generally wouldn't choose to do so, but when in Greece.
So is that a yes or no?
When in Rome, do as the Romans do.
That's a yes.
That's a yes.
Yeah, it is.
But, you know, I said first when in Greece, because of all the grease you put in that pan.
Very good.
All right.
I'm on the ball here.
No, you're not.
No, yes, I am.
Drunker than a scuck.
I ain't even modestly drunk, bro.
Bullshit.
Be careful with those scissors.
I don't want more blood than's already in the package.
Now, this is my drink, which I've been nursing for like three hours, so I'm not very drunk.
Yeah.
Three minutes.
Okay, so we're opening up these highly suspect packages of meat.
They have no labels on them whatsoever, so you actually have no idea where they came from.
Do you know where these came from, Steve?
Yeah, I do.
Because, like, if you buy something important, you want to know, like, who brought it to you.
So where did these come from?
These came from QVC.
Holy shit.
Really?
Yeah.
These are QVC meats?
QVC meats.
Oh my fucking God.
I can't believe.
I can't believe you'd even deigned.
I mean, I don't know why you would.
This is a terrifying moment, bro.
I have so much trust in you that I'm going to eat a QVC meat, because otherwise, I would never do that.
Then don't do it.
No, I'm going to, you know.
No, always.
If you have faith, I'm going to share your faith.
No problem.
Watch out.
You're getting blood all over the place there, dude.
Yeah, so what?
Well, you don't want to get on, like, the carpet and stuff.
No, I don't care.
Okay.
I guess that's part of the ritual, right?
The blood?
Yeah.
The blood you need with the better.
There you go.
But what are we going to do with all this?
Come on.
Simple.
We're going to put some good stuff on it.
Good stuff?
What kind of good stuff are we going to put on it?
Here you go.
Here's my favorite.
That's my favorite.
Prime rib and roast seasoning.
Carl's.
Carl's.
Copy.
I'm with you.
I wondered what you were going to put on there.
Yeah.
Just some stuff.
Let's get a good close-up here.
Stuff.
Hang on.
Huh?
Having, like, a social media moment together.
Yeah, no shit.
This will be on YouTube tomorrow.
Please, no.
Well, don't bury it, bro.
Who's cooking this?
You or me?
You.
Then shut the fuck up.
I got you, bro.
You won't have to give me that instruction twice.
Jesus Christ.
Jesus?
Jesus Christ.
Jesus.
Why did you only spice one side?
I don't care what day you were born on.
What, what, why did you only spice one side, bro?
One side yet.
Ah, capisce.
So now he's stirring the disgusting grease.
The lard.
The lard.
The manteca.
The manteca.
Yeah, manteca.
Hear that?
And the stakes are down, people.
Wow, this is the signature moment that everything has been leading out to this moment.
Are you even watching?
Everything has been leading up to this moment.
You, Hassel.
You're so fucked up.
This is the moment the stakes are down.
This is like the moment that they ignite the rocket that goes into space.
This is the whole purpose of everything that happened before.
Except, I don't know what's happening with these fries over here, right?
They're still all frozen and crystallized and shit.
So I don't know, man.
I don't know if he's got the synchronization to pull this off.
We're going first.
Yep.
So he's adjusting his strategy now.
He thinks that, um...
I'm under pressure.
He thinks he's going to...
First of all, he doesn't realize that we're both going to become absolutely world famous from this.
But look at what he's doing here, right?
He has 100,000 hits.
We're going to get 300,000, 500,000, 600,000 hits.
He's taking filet mignons, right?
And taking them off the heat.
And he thinks he's going to have enough time.
Salute.
Salute.
Wait.
Salute.
He thinks he's going to have enough time that he can actually fry potatoes before the filet mignons become catastrophically overdone.
And we all know, ladies and gentlemen, that this is a physical impossibility.
No, that's easy.
He has set himself a task that no French chef would ever attempt without a parachute.
He's going to fry the potatoes in olive oil.
He's going to fry the potatoes in olive oil.
Oh, that's pretty, uh...
That's pretty sweet looking in there.
That's the real shit there, bro.
Oh, he's got an electronic pepper grinder.
Radar activated, dude.
Yeah.
Radar activated, dude.
That's the good shit.
Oh, some sea salt here.
This is very important.
Woo-hoo!
Wow, that's some good shit there.
Meanwhile, the steaks are frying.
He still thinks he can pull this off.
I think the hubris and arrogance of such an idea is almost unimaginable.
Oh, he's now about to commit a culinary sin, which is to use powdered garlic.
Disgusting.
But maybe he can make this work.
I think it's at least plausible that something could happen with these fries.
Something could happen with these fries that isn't just completely inedible.
This is Zoe, by the way.
Hi, Zoe.
What are you doing, little girl?
Zoe is a love muffin of the house, so everyone knows.
It's a really important character in this home.
She is the love muffin.
Extraordinary.
Look at this face.
Oh, my God.
She doesn't actually want to lie down on the cold floor.
Okay, more radar-activated pepper.
Very important.
And it's starting to smell kind of good in here, I gotta say.
Wow, he actually flipped those in the pan by hand.
That was some good shit.
Especially considering that he's like 17 Coors beers in.
Fifteen.
Oh, excuse me, sir.
Yes, fifteen.
I don't know what he thinks he's going to do with this ciabatta over here, but he took
it out of the refrigerator and made a gesture with it as if it were significant.
It's probably been in the refrigerator already for 17 or more days.
It's almost completely unedible, but it could be 17 or more months.
He's got a plan for this shit, people.
And, you know, it's going to probably...
Oh, he's got it in plastic.
Okay, so that shit's still actually bread.
Unlike the other Italian roll that went into the trash can earlier.
Here's the bloody plate that the steak was on.
Now, if I know my friend, what he's going to do is, after he's cooked these steaks, he's
going to plop them right back onto this plate with the fresh blood on it.
You'd know your friend well.
Last time he made his bison burgers, we had the raw meat on a bison burger plate.
He plopped those fuckers on the barbecue, and when they were done, he tried to put them
on the bloody plate that he put them on the barbecue from.
But, you know, rednecks, they really cook like crazy.
Whoops.
Okay, I fumbled, I fully fumbled, and knocked my drink over.
And that's the act of a person who's fairly intoxicated.
Oh, so.
Obviously.
But I didn't spill my whole drink.
Only half?
Yeah, maybe about two-thirds.
Whoops.
Well, I, I, it's indelicate when it happens at a neighbor's house when you're a guest.
It is indelicate.
It's indelicate, dude.
You're a rotten bastard.
You don't want to be spilling their booze all over there.
Yeah, rotten bastard.
Okay, look at this.
Wait, it's got better.
Look.
What?
Here, look at me.
I'm a fucking idiot, right?
Look at my, look at my purse.
See that?
I've captured my mask.
You lost it?
No.
I captured my mask on the handle of this, and I was all fucking crazy.
Yeah, it's fucked up.
Okay, he has just flipped the stakes, but the case is still going.
I got to say, so far, as far as I can tell, he might be able to pull this off.
Get the fuck out of the way.
I thought it was impossible in the beginning.
I'm out of the way, bro.
I'm spectating.
Now, we're going to spice the other sides with this secret redneck recipe.
This is the best redneck stuff you've ever had.
Carl's.
Carl's.
Carl's prime rib seasoning.
I got some other shit in here, by the way.
Oh, don't go there.
There's a fucking peanut butter jar full of cayenne pepper in there.
Yeah, there it is.
You know what I'm talking about, people?
I'm not talking about fucking rib.
He's got like a two-pound peanut butter jar of cayenne pepper in there,
but hasn't put anything on the fries yet that will heat them up.
Will he change our minds?
Oh, he's going to flip that shit.
It's a serious shit, man, right here.
Drunk Cooking, Friday night, 3 a.m. at Steve's.
You are with us.
How about some?
He sliced up this ciabatta, but he hasn't got it in the oven yet.
The crowd is holding their breath.
He's pulling out the butter.
Apparently, he's not going to put lard on the bread,
which is very surprising and unexpected.
Mmm.
Look at those thick slices of bread, people.
He's going to slather those fuckers with some butter
and put them in the goddamn oven.
Will you stop?
I might just fucking stop.
Okay, I'll stop here.
No, don't stop.
Just stop.
Just fucking stop.
Wait, you can't make up your mind whether I should stop or not?
No, no, just stop.
Actually stop?
I don't think you're even fucking doing it.
I full am on doing this, and I will put this on my YouTube channel tomorrow.
I straight up will.
Don't you dare.
I totally will, bro.
I tell you what.
No name.
Look, the names have been changed to protect the year.
You're going to take a beating.
I don't know when the last time you got your ass kicked.
See, now physical, ladies and gentlemen,
the situation has just escalated to the threat of actual physical violence.
If this makes the internet, you're going to take a fucking beating.
I guarantee you, you prick.
Okay, I'm actually going to shake the potatoes up a little bit here.
This is going to have a roll in the thing.
You never stop because I'm in sidelined.
Okay, bro.
I just wanted you all to know that the steaks look pretty good.
The potatoes are smelling pretty great.
There is still a tub of lard on the side of the oven,
which is making me very nervous.
But Steve is an amazing cook,
and he has pulled off the impossible.
He has completed the potatoes.
There was room for my life like this.
He has completed the potatoes
while still preserving the juiciness
and not yet completed status of the filet and yaw.
Ladies and gentlemen,
a big hand for my friend Steve.
His last name will be omitted.
Thank you and good night.
I'm going to communicate to you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
