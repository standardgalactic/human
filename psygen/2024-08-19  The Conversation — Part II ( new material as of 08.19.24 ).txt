And it would be helpful if you started with the scar tissue.
Yeah.
Alright, so when I was a kid,
I became aware at some point,
I don't know what age,
that there was something horrifyingly wrong with the adults
in how they thought and
how they related with me as a being
and with their,
what they would do,
especially if they were forming an accusation
like you did something wrong,
this kind of thing.
And it took me a long time
to realize
and it took me much, much longer
to be able to articulate it.
There was a catastrophic problem
in the systems they were using
to ascribe or derive identity,
function,
and outcome,
like, or cause,
like, cause and effect, right?
Especially where it came to human beings,
me particularly as a child.
And I realized there's something horrifyingly wrong in their minds,
and eventually this was so terrifying
that me and a few of my friends made a deal
with each other when we were 11,
that if any of us made it to 30,
the others would come and take us out
so that we would not be subject to this
because we didn't want to live
like the adults around us.
We knew they were fucking broken in their minds,
even though we loved them,
and they seemed like gods
because they could do things like
have jobs and buy cars
and, you know,
repair things or build things
or all these things.
And, uh,
so I made a vow to myself as a child
that I would somehow remember
what it was like to be a child,
even if I became subject to the strange thing
that had destroyed the minds of my,
of all the adults around us,
and particularly our teachers,
even though they were a little bit better.
And occasionally you'd meet someone
who was a little bit outside of the problem,
and the people I looked to primarily for that
were science fiction authors.
So yeah, these three things.
How adults perceive and treat identity,
particularly in children and or,
you know, mothers, women, whatever.
Um, the softer beings, we might say.
Uh, how they treated cause and effect.
And what they thought of
as what something was for.
Like, why it is or its function.
And these three things,
they're out of their fucking minds.
Like, they're just completely batshit insane.
They're using systems that are not human,
that we didn't develop.
We inherited this shit when we were born.
They inherited it from their insane parents,
and we just keep passing it down to our children.
It's a fucking nightmare.
It's literally, like, it makes our world hell,
and it makes it impossible for us to survive.
Yeah, and so...
You were talking about how it's just so,
so please, run by that again.
Yeah, I mean, we're sitting in the middle of it.
We're looking at computers that are connected
to infrastructure that people are glued to
on a daily basis.
We're sitting in homes that were built
not for love or appreciation of life,
but for profit, and...
I mean, that's everything.
I mean, literally, not a day goes by in this city
where I'm not constantly just hearing cars
around and around and around
in this grid-like system.
It just...
Most of the world is paved.
If you go outside,
cars own most of the terrain out there,
and they will kill you right now with impunity.
They're not human.
They're not beings.
They're just machines running around.
I just have to say,
never in the history of nature
was there ever an object,
even one time,
that would just run right over you,
especially with a being inside it, right?
When deers freeze in the headlights,
and humans are like,
why don't they get out the fuck out the way?
The humans are actually the stupid animal there
because the deer knows something
that's fundamentally evolutionarily sound,
which is if you stop,
no creature is just going to bash the fuck into you
and kill you, right?
If you stop,
the other creature will be able to go around you.
This is not what happens in cars.
What happens in cars is if you stop,
you get killed, right?
You have to get the fuck out of the way of the car
because the car is doing something
that nothing in nature does,
excuse me, does,
with the possible exception
of a boulder rolling down a mountainside.
But even that,
at least that thing's predictable, kind of.
Yeah, and also,
I mean, I've never been in front of a rhino.
I don't know what that would be like,
but I imagine...
But that's something that's trying to hit you, right?
I mean, you could get in the way of,
for example,
a herd of buffalo
and you'd be in bad shape
because that thing can't go around you.
It can't really stop.
Yeah, and also just looking at garages
and seeing how a part of,
a major part of the home
is for the car to be safe and safe.
Yeah, not only that,
what those cars,
like if you look and you see,
it's all...
If you look at a city block,
it's like a cell
surrounded by viruses of enormous size, right?
You know, like in The Princess Bride,
they have those mice of...
Rats of enormous size or whatever, right?
But we have our viruses of enormous size
and they're called cars.
And the cars are literally draining the lifeblood
out of the people inside the buildings
to pay for the insurance
and the fucking repairs
and the parking and the tickets
and the fucking registration
and the gas
and all these things.
And so it's really like
you have a demon outside
that's sucking your life out of you.
And most of the time,
it's just sitting there.
And by the way,
I want to ask you
a really interesting question
about cognition.
Sure.
And identity.
And the question is,
what is a car
when you're not using it?
It is just a hollow space
that sits there.
Because it's not a vehicle.
Right.
Right?
So what is it?
Because when you're not driving it
and it's not transporting you,
I would argue that its identity
changes into something
completely different.
A hundred percent, yeah.
That we don't even talk,
we never talk about this, right?
We just think,
no, it's a car
because that's the category
of object that it belongs to.
What do you think?
You use this stool as a table
more than use it as a stool.
Absolutely, I do.
I mean, it's just,
and that's a very simplistic answer,
but if my phone's battery were to die,
this would just be a brick.
It would just be,
it would honestly suck.
I would hate to plug this thing around
if it wasn't so capable
of doing things in my life.
So yeah,
that is a very good point.
Because most of the time,
the car's just sitting there
unless, what,
you're an Uber driver
or you're a taxi driver
or whatever.
Well, I lived out of my car.
Yeah, sure.
That could be a home.
Yeah, and it was
more than a vehicle.
It probably wasn't designed
to be a home.
I would gather,
I would guess
that it's probably fairly toxic
inside that thing
in terms of chemistry,
but I haven't done the testing.
Yeah.
I mean,
it's a lot of plastic in there,
for sure.
A lot of plastic and glue
and stuff.
A lot of heat
that goes into there.
Right,
there's a lot of off-gassing
and rubber
and foam and things.
Who knows what that carpet's made of?
Yeah.
The upholstery isn't leather,
so what the fuck is that?
You know,
like,
molecularly,
it's got to be weird.
Well,
I've had the fortune
of living in nature
for extended periods of time
for very little expense.
And I can tell you,
it,
well,
first of all,
it was painful
because that,
it provides so much space
for
this kind of conversation
to come up.
It's like,
wow,
I really can see
with new eyes
how I've been living my life
and how disconnected from it.
It's like deprogramming happens
within the first three days
of just being in nature.
And having done that
for two months,
by the end of it,
my nervous system
was dreading
coming back to the city.
Yeah,
for a good reason,
yeah.
Like,
like,
deep pits in my stomach.
and I told myself,
you know,
I don't want to go back
and I'm going to do
what I can to get out of it.
But here I am back in the city
and I'm already thinking,
okay,
so I got to get a place
and how much is rent
and I got to get a job
and am I going to like the job
and how am I going to socialize?
And it's like,
holy shit,
I'm sucked back
into it immediately.
It's,
it's,
it's natural
because I'm used to
thinking about these things
but it,
my eyes have been opened
to a different way of living
and it's not going to be the same.
I can't be in a house
without just analyzing
how ridiculous it is to be
and all the objects
that are around
and,
um,
yeah.
And,
and,
okay,
so I just want to take us back.
Sure.
Hold your,
bookmark your thought
if you've got something good.
Yeah.
You got it bookmarked?
Yeah.
Awesome.
So what we were talking about
is I was saying
that what we inherit,
that what,
what,
okay,
this is so,
what is running,
I had nightmares
back when I was badly hurt.
I would,
I would,
I would start dreaming
that I'm on a bus
and I would suddenly realize
that there was some kind
of fundamental problem
and I would turn
terrifyingly
to look at the driver
and it'd be nothing
in the driver's seat
and I realized like,
oh,
we are fucked
because you can't stop the bus,
you can't steer the bus,
it's just going to take you,
whatever the fuck is,
what,
there's a ghost,
it's the absence
of a human
that is sitting
in the driver's seat
and this is what
is driving
our fucking societies,
our civilizations,
our cultures.
It's not a human,
it's not even a monster,
it's worse than a monster.
It's the abject absence
of humanity
and we think
and treat
these processes
as if they are persons.
We think like,
if Google says like,
oh,
we're really sorry
about what happened to you,
there's no thing there
to be sorry.
There's no sorriness,
there's no senses,
there's no emotion.
A corporation
doesn't have a mind,
it's not a person.
A government
doesn't have a mind,
it's not a person.
They will kill everything.
They will kill your children,
they will eat them up,
they will carve them up
and feed them to dogs.
It doesn't matter,
like,
they don't care.
There's nothing there to care
and so what we're actually faced with
is that our social systems,
the infrastructure
that we inherit
when we're born
as modern humans,
it's not merely malignant,
it's actively
zero-sum game theoretically,
despises life
and what it feeds on
is habit,
fear,
and money.
essentially
these three things
and so
we're in
this weird situation
where
the sclerosis
in the history
of human thought
and behavior
is what's running.
It's like the scar tissue,
the dead,
cancerous scar tissue
is what's running
our culture
and our corporations
and our,
what we call governments
and we think of this
as civilization
which is just
mind-blowing.
So far,
we haven't been able
to invent anything
that can now compete it
but it should be relatively
easy to do so,
I think.
Well,
and that perfectly segues
into where I was going
so I've had that dream
many times
of being in the backseat
of a car
and realizing
that no one's driving
and surprisingly,
it's navigating traffic
but it's fucking terrifying.
It does,
I'm like swiping past
stop signs
and I eventually
get into the driver's seat
and I slam on the brakes
and it doesn't work,
you know,
and I love in dreams
when I hit the brakes
and nothing happens.
Yeah.
That's one of my favorite things.
Yeah,
me too,
it's exhilarating.
That's actually how I feel
most of the time
in waking life.
Yeah.
Right,
the brakes in the car work,
the brakes on civilization
don't work at all,
right,
like there's no way to stop,
yeah,
go ahead.
Well,
and when I brake myself
that's when I,
you know,
anyway,
another dream that I had
when I was little
was arguably one of the
scariest dreams
I've ever had.
I was in a completely
white void
and there was a red line
that extended infinitely
in one direction
and infinitely in the other
and it didn't matter
which direction I went
because it was essentially
going to be the same
and I had to choose.
It was like,
you have to choose
which way you're going to go
and you're going to be
walking that line forever.
And essentially what you're saying
is there's no choice criteria
or?
There was sort of a sense
between future and past.
Okay.
And so that really,
I relate to that in a way
because I think,
okay,
I agree,
the scar tissue system
that's going on,
there are people
who I've met
who think that
we can progressively
change the system
to a better future
and there,
and then there's me
who's had a taste
of what it's like
to be out in nature
and that feels
more like going back
into the past
of like,
you know,
sloughing off the technology
and just saying,
okay,
let's,
sloughing off the electronics
and the,
you know,
and just going back
to more indigenous ways
of thinking
if we could even recover
such a thing.
Anyway,
my point is
there was that choice
in that dream
of go to the future
and go to the past
and that scared
the shit out of me
until I realized
that if you just step
out of that paradigm,
out of that dualistic thing,
there,
there,
there's got to be
another way of living
where it's not simply
just go back to the land
and,
you know,
this,
this is where I don't know.
This is what I'm still
trying to figure out
because I think
there's so much beauty
with relating in the land
and,
and eating,
growing your own food
and having smaller communities,
but that's what
we were doing before
and something much bigger,
you know,
call it greed,
call it fear,
whatever we did
as humanity
to stomp that out
and colonize
and fear,
I have a feeling
that will happen again
if we just go back
to the land
unless something changes
and I don't know
what that would be.
Did I articulate that?
That was good.
There's so much there.
You know,
I'm reminded
of various things
that I heard
Eric Weinstein
talking about
this afternoon
as I was listening
to him
attempting to explain
to somebody
who I thought
was pretty dense
why they should be afraid
about artificial intelligence
and what it does
or why they should realize
that we're a dead species
walking since the first guy said,
huh,
I wonder if there's
these things called neutrons
and why Eric,
who is Jewish,
talks about Passover
because Passover
isn't a celebration.
Passover is the active reenactment
of the remembrance
of get the fuck
out of here now
so that we can survive
long enough
to have children again,
that kind of thing
or something like that
in Eric Weinstein's mind.
In any case,
he was talking
and I thought
this was so amazing
because the host,
who I think is very dense,
was saying,
this is the most exciting time
to be,
I can't,
I just,
I love being alive right now,
it's amazing,
it's just,
there's all these amazing
things happening
and Eric's going like,
you are broken
in your mind,
my friend,
like I love you
and everything
but you're not awake.
Did he say that?
Yeah,
essentially.
Yeah,
I cannot imagine
feeling that
unless you're living
a very privileged life
at the moment.
Well,
the guy's a comedian
so that has something
to do with it perhaps
but,
which,
you know,
Eric is like,
I think we've underestimated
comedians.
They're at least on par
with philosophers
and maybe better
but,
what Eric said was,
I visited this place
called something like
Encounter Beach
and I'm thinking like,
this is where humans
encounter beings
from the sky
or it's going to be amazing.
He was like,
this is where
the indigenous people
first encountered
the colonizing people
and I want you
to think
because they probably
thought that was
an amazing time
to be like,
this is just amazing,
these beautiful humans
in these giant vessels
from who knows where,
right,
have come
and they're going to,
we're going to be together
and we're going to,
and they're going to
fucking give us blankets
and smallpox
and kill our fucking children
and just massacre us
en masse
and bury us
in graves
that aren't even,
I mean,
they'll just burn our bodies
and they're going to
assassinate the entire
species of bison
and they're going to
kill all the bears
and kill the jaguars
and the fucking,
you know,
bobcats
and everything that moves
they're just going to kill it
and they're not going to
stop there.
They're going to go after
the fucking frogs
and the toads
and the salamanders
and the spiders
and they're going to
spray DDT
and then,
they're not going to
stop there.
They're going to go
from there to Roundup.
They're not going to
stop there.
They're going to build
nuclear weapons.
They're not going to
stop there.
They're going to build
neutron bombs
that only kill the organisms
and don't leave any radiation
so you get to have
just the,
only,
you know,
the dead,
sterilized space.
There's no fucking bacteria
even there anymore,
right?
It's just dead space.
And so it sounds like
there isn't just no driver.
It sounds like there is
a killing machine
that is just stabbing me.
That's the fucking problem.
Yeah.
It's the absence
of everything
that could be human
that is literally
driving the processes
that own our species
at the group level
just as if you were
in a fucking cage.
Yeah.
That's just own it.
Completely own it.
Yeah.
And weirdly,
what's happening is
there's this spiral,
this,
this,
um,
uh,
exponential process
of spiralizing
recursive
recolonization
so that
our,
and a lot of my friends
aren't really concerned,
like,
I don't really care
if Facebook fucking
learns shit about me
or Google,
you know,
fucking studies me
or whatever.
I don't,
I don't fucking care.
They're giving me,
the advertisements are better,
you know,
like,
what are they going to do
with it?
And I'm like,
oh my fucking God,
are you,
are you have like
two neurons left
in your mind?
Like,
what are you even thinking?
Sedated pig in a cage.
Yeah,
right.
That Radiohead song,
yeah.
If you can be
psychographized,
you can be directly
manipulated
and not only,
okay,
even if you,
yourself,
right,
suppose that
you or I,
we decide like,
okay,
zero electronic
communication from now on.
Nothing.
Ever again,
in my,
the rest of my life.
No more cell phone,
no more internet,
no more computer.
Right.
The problem is,
they'll psychographize
your friends
and don't manipulate
your friends
and unless you're going
to be an absolute isolate
and live entirely by yourself,
which is the complete opposite
of what human,
the human animal is for.
We are for communal nature,
right?
We are pod animals
like dolphins or bonobos
or not necessarily
like chimpanzees.
Those things are a little nuts.
But yeah,
we are,
we are more like the,
the whales
and the bonobos and stuff.
We thrive and need
tightly knit,
small group intimacy
in my view
from,
from everything
I've learned about.
So go ahead.
Yeah.
Well,
and that's the thing.
It's like,
I really thought
I was going to have to go
the hermit route
and I,
I've felt enough isolation
to know how bad
that stings
and how dull
it feels.
It's an understatement.
Okay.
Can I just say
a little bit
about your situation?
Please.
I know that you're struggling
and you're trying
to understand
like where,
what do I do now?
Where do I go?
How do I make this work?
And what I want
to suggest to you
and I want you
to think about it
over time
and have to answer
right now or whatever
and we can get on
with the sort of
little,
the fun talk
that we're having now.
And what I want
to suggest to you
is a hybrid existence
where you're neither,
okay,
there's alone time,
there's symbiotic time
in nature
and there's city time
and there's communal time
and you just orbit around
just like you've been doing
and you don't have to bind
to any specific thing.
That's a really powerful perspective
and that's something
I definitely,
I love the idea
of just choose one,
which is a virus of its own.
One thing mine.
One thing mine.
I fall victim to it
quite a bit
and it's something
One thing mine,
my son.
You think one thing.
Think one thing.
Think one thing true.
One thing good.
One thing the way.
Only one thing way.
One thing way,
it help you.
Is that from a movie?
No, I made that up.
You made that up?
Toymaker fucked me up about that.
He was like,
you guys have this
one thing problem.
What the?
Actually,
Alfred Korzybski calls it
single valued thinking.
Single valued thinking.
Yeah,
well,
it plagues me to this day.
It still eats my insides.
It fucks me up too,
but at least I'm aware of it
and we can talk about it.
Once we have nomenclature
and we can agree
to help each other
see beyond,
then we've got the chance
of getting
a sort of a superposition
above what normally
happens to us as humans.
For sure.
Well,
certainly in my time
spent alone,
when that has been
a positive thing for me,
it's really bloomed
so much insight
and so much direction
in my life.
But then it proceeds by,
okay,
I need to go find people
who think like me
or at least I can
talk to about this
and we can just
start getting the ball
rolling in some way
and I've met
a lot of people
who really care
about the state
of the world
at the moment
and...
I bet they don't
know what to do.
They don't know
what to do
and I've never met
anyone who says
I see the whole picture,
I know how
everything is going.
Oh,
so you don't know
that Ken Wilber?
Hmm?
You just need to meet
Ken Wilber, bro.
I don't know who that is.
He's got the whole thing.
He's got the whole thing.
We've got to talk
to that guy.
Ken is the man.
Yeah.
But I do see
lots of different
perspectives that
join together
are very powerful
and so there are
people who are
working on this
issue in their
own way.
Which phone
is recording?
That one.
Gotcha.
We're just having
a little private
joke there.
Yeah,
go ahead.
Yeah,
and I'm excited
because it's really
the thing I care
about the most
is the state
of the world
at the moment.
How could I not?
I mean,
I want life
to continue
and,
you know,
maybe,
actually I'm not
going to go there
because I feel
like that's dangerous.
No, no,
go.
Okay,
now that you,
yeah,
let's go.
Okay.
In my spiritual
journey,
I've spent a lot
of time
zooming out,
zooming out
beyond myself
and sort of
altruistically
loving other
beings,
and I've spent
a lot of time
in scenarios
of just like,
oh,
what would I do
to save another
being's life?
And there are
so many scenarios
which I would
give my life
for proliferation
of beauty
and I can't
say,
oh,
well,
these are the
scenarios in which
I would do it,
these are the
scenarios I wouldn't,
but there are
certain,
I'm sure one thing
might need by the way,
right?
but there are,
I just know
that they exist
and that willingness
to die for,
I say beauty,
but,
you know,
just an ineffable,
It's something like
meaning,
meaningful,
so here's the thing,
we're all trying
to avoid death
very furiously,
we have these like
houses that are
fucking dead inside
so we're protected
from death,
right?
There's nothing
moving in here,
which is a lesson
that my friend's dog
Hado taught me
as he watched
those leaves
outside my window
moving in the wind
and he was just
like glued to them
for like dear life
the way a diver
is glued to oxygen
because there's not
one fucking thing
moving in my house
that's alive,
right?
And Hado's alive,
which by the way
is Masaru Emoto's
The Spirit of Water
is called Hado,
which is how the dog
gets his name.
In any case,
where the fuck
am I going here?
I walked in a train of thought.
Oh yes,
beauty.
Alright,
so we're really trying
to preserve our lives
and we don't realize
but you start to realize
as you get older
and death starts
getting closer,
you start realizing
like,
why have I been
protecting this thing
that is supposed
to be given up
for something
beautiful
and amazing
and profound,
right?
And I think
in a way,
and Kevin would love
to hear me saying this,
you know,
we have this model
of Jesus
which Amon Hillman
would completely attack
but we also have
this model
of Socrates
who gave up his life,
right?
Rather than be
divided
from his
companions
and children
and elders
and,
I mean,
he was an elder
by this time
and he was accused
of impiety
because he proposed
that even the gods
were subject
to truth,
right?
And so that there was
a principle
that was higher
than the gods
and this is a very
complex story
so I'm going to skip
over that
and just say something
really simple.
as you get older
you begin to realize
that a life
is something
that should be given
for the sake
of beauty
and virtue
and verity
and insight
and love
and,
you know,
maybe even truth
and it's,
it's fucking miserable
to find yourself
at the end of your life
not having given
for that.
Having just bought
into fear
or whatever.
or just protected
the fuck
out of the thing.
Well,
and that's the thing,
it's like,
I've had enough
privilege in my life
and safety
to know what it's like
to be like,
okay,
all my basic needs
are met
but,
God damn,
am I starving
for meaning.
Like,
oh my God,
do I need,
and you can go
into the hierarchy
of needs
or whatever
and it's right there.
By the way,
that's stolen
from the Blackfoot people
and completely misinterpreted.
Is it?
Yeah,
like Ryan
and his elder,
was it Alan,
Alan Part was one of,
no,
Narciss,
Ryan and Narciss
used to go around
the universities
and tell the story
of how,
what is his name,
the hierarchy
of needs guy,
I can't remember it.
It's not Pavlov,
it's like,
I don't know.
It'll come to me,
but yeah,
how that guy
essentially wrote that
right after hanging out
with Blackfoot people
and having basically
misinterpreted
the foundational principles
that orient
their way of life
and of course,
you know,
commodifying it
and turning it
into a new system,
blah, blah, blah, blah,
blah, but anyway,
yes.
Well, the theorium
still works.
So, the,
the,
yeah,
that,
that,
that meaning
and,
and Maslow.
Maslow.
Maslow's hierarchy
of needs.
Yep, that's right.
I'm just going to mention
Ryan First Diver,
right,
and Narciss's Blood.
Yeah, go ahead.
Okay.
Well, that's pretty much it.
No, no, it's not.
What you're trying to say
is something,
okay,
can I,
sure,
re-spark you here?
All right,
what you're trying to say
is I've had these realizations
and I'm trying to find people
like myself
and I'm finding some people
but nobody really knows
what to do.
Nobody's got a plan,
number one.
And what's the next?
Right.
Go ahead.
Well, personally,
now I'm back
to a stage
where it's like
I need to get
my basic needs met.
Like,
I need to re-stabilize
and have like
some sort of system
of getting food
and shelter consistently
because I've been
on the road so long.
And then once doing that,
I,
I will really,
will be in that search again.
Right now,
I'm kind of doing both
at the same time.
Okay,
I got you.
And so,
yeah,
I mean,
I have you in my life
which is incredible.
And vice versa.
Right.
And now I know
so many people
who care about this issue
even if they have
different ways
of going about it.
It's true.
And I'm very interested
specifically.
Mention the community
in Oakland?
Right.
Right.
Who are they called?
Canticle.
Canticle?
Canticle Farms.
Canticle Farms.
Okay.
And where,
where is the farm
where you were
recently involved?
I don't,
I don't know
if that.
Should be mentioned?
Yeah,
I don't know.
Okay,
fair enough.
I don't know.
That's what?
I feel like I'm not
a good representative
for those groups.
That's,
we're not asking you
to be a representative.
It's just plugging,
so the other people
who are listening
might know,
might be able
to find that path.
But it's okay.
You're fine.
Well,
I will say
Canticle Farms
is very accessible.
They have a website,
I think,
so.
Okay.
And these are
intention,
they're people oriented
toward intentional community
and what,
food sovereignty
and living together
on the land
to some degree.
I would look
at their website.
I think,
I would be
a representative
for themselves.
Yeah,
they can speak
for themselves.
Yeah.
And so,
anyway,
and it's not just that,
it's people I've met
on the road
who,
and I'm very interested
in bridging,
learning how to
solve conflicts
within people's own
bodily,
psychical systems
and also
between people.
I really love
doing that.
and I've had,
I've been doing it
my entire life.
I've been doing it
poorly for most
of my entire life,
but really giving it heart.
But now
that I'm in touch
with my own heart
and I'm learning,
yeah,
I just,
that's what really
calls to me.
And so,
that's sort of
the role
that I,
that's the North Star
I'm following
at the moment.
You know,
it's like how,
how can I learn
to help people
connect to themselves
and take care
of themselves
and also how can I
help connect
people who
would be good
to be connected,
be together.
That's brilliant.
I absolutely
believe in that path
and celebrate
that motivation,
that orientation,
which I think
is natural
to human beings.
Rescue each other,
go pull the thorns,
pull the,
the stabbing pin,
like the voodoo pins
that have been placed
in the,
in the people we love,
just like slide
those gently out
and then throw them away,
right?
So that person
can just like
have a,
have a meaningful
living situation
and,
and interiority
can heal
and their bodies
can heal
and their,
their psyches
can heal
and all of this.
And I,
I absolutely
love and respect
that motivation.
At the same time,
and I've got,
you know,
a nine,
nine vector view,
right?
Not a one vector view,
right?
But we both know
that the humans
have reached
critical mass
in terms of
their technology.
And so this is
part of what Eric
was saying
that he couldn't
get his host
to understand
is that,
that happened
in 1930,
30 something bro.
We're just a dead
species walking
and blah, blah, blah.
Now I'm,
I'm a bit,
you know,
I'm a talented
doom singer
because I'm
really concerned
about,
so I,
I love the humans.
I'm not
a misanthrope,
but the humans
at the group level
are a fucking
terrifying
absence of,
I don't even know
what to call it.
It's,
it makes nightmares
look happy
and joyful.
But I,
I'm an anthropophile.
I love the humans.
But much more
than being an anthropophile,
I'm a gaophile.
I love the earth.
I just believe
in the earth
to an unimaginable degree.
And I'm a biophile.
I love the organisms.
To me,
the organisms
and the earth
and the humans
are the same thing.
So if you harm
the organisms,
you harm the earth.
You harm the history
and future of life
on earth.
You harm the humans.
Right?
You can't get away
with speciesism
or valuing one thing
over the other
much.
There are exceptions,
right?
Again,
in a nine-vector view,
you can focus
on vectors
where one thing
is more important
because of X.
But it seems to me
that our desire
to rescue individual humans,
heal them,
to be medicinal to them,
won't matter
if the context collapses.
For sure.
So here's one of the things
that happens
at least to males.
I can't speak for females.
They can speak for themselves.
They can determine
whether this happens to them.
I would love to hear
from females about this.
By the way,
this kind of noise
is a very selfish thing.
In any case,
sometime around adolescence,
we...
There's this great book
by Larry Niven
called Protector.
And I'm not going
to go into
the story
right now.
This is one of my
very favorite
science fiction books.
Along with...
I'm going to mention
a couple of others.
Macroscope,
What if the Stars
Are Gods,
Dahlgren,
and one or two other.
What about
Speaker for the Dead?
Oh, yeah.
Speaker for the Dead
is amazing.
Unfortunately,
Orson Scott Carr
is kind of a bad
human being.
But, yeah,
some of his books
are nuts.
The whole
Ender's Game trilogy
is...
or, you know,
series is very amazing.
So what happens to us,
and I don't think
there's enough talk
about this,
is that if we are
altruistically oriented,
and many of us are,
I just have to mention
Lucius Shepard,
unusual science fiction
author that I adore,
who wrote Life
During Wartime,
and other books.
Okay, so what happens
is we start to have
the desire of protecting
things,
and this may happen
to us before
we become adolescents.
You might want to
protect your little sister
or your little brother
or even your older brother
or your older sister.
You might want to
protect your family.
There's this very
intrinsic to the masculine
protect the beings
feeling.
And what happens
in adolescence,
or at least what
happened to me,
is that that feeling
became...
Okay.
Oh, there's so many
problems here.
So one of the problems
is this.
I suspect that until
fairly recently,
it was impossible
to think as a human
being or as a male
of, quote,
the world, unquote.
There was no such
thing as the world.
What you knew about
were the people
you lived with
and the place
in which you lived.
And that was it.
You didn't know
doodly squat about
China or South America
or anything like that,
right?
There was just sort of
this fog on the border
of territory.
Exactly, right?
The world was
our place.
And we were
the people.
Not a people.
The people.
We were the people.
If you look at
indigenous culture,
in every single one
of them,
they're like,
we are the people.
Really?
Yeah.
And the origin story
is about where
the people,
us,
where we come from.
Not where all humans
come from,
where we come from.
And that mountain
over there,
and this river over here,
and that lake over there,
those are the delimiters
of the world,
right?
when there's stories.
Wait, hold on.
I just want to be
clear.
Yeah, go ahead.
Sure.
So,
what,
I have heard
other,
I've heard
indigenous cultures
through
people who are
indigenous,
and also,
or people who,
my vocabulary here
is,
people who have
that
lineage,
and also,
museums,
they talk about
people from the stars,
they talk about,
Dogon people,
for example,
do that.
I just,
I have a hard time
believing
that they think
that they
are the only
people
in the world.
And maybe
it can be interpreted
by,
that could be
an interpretation
of their words,
but,
considering their
robust cosmology,
and also their,
relationship
with the land,
it's hard for me
to,
I don't know,
but I do want
to challenge that.
Great, yeah,
I don't know either,
and I think,
I'm glad you challenged
that.
Please,
always feel free
to do that
in our conversations.
I want to learn
and see better.
I know there's a lot
of evidence
for people thinking,
okay,
so let me just
ask you a question.
Sure.
Right.
Can you imagine
a situation
in which a given
group of
humans
decides
and enacts
this decision
that any other
humans that come
who would kill them?
We'll not ask
some questions
and not talk
with them.
If they come,
who would kill them?
Can you imagine
a reason for that?
And can you imagine
that going on?
I mean,
I can imagine
only if there's
like some sort
of precedent
where it's like,
okay,
that didn't go
so well
the last couple times.
Oh, yeah,
that's good.
But maybe,
like,
before having
met anyone
previously?
Not so much.
Not so much.
No.
I can't imagine.
So I basically
try to understand
this question
at some point
and I'm not claiming
that my insight
was profound
or whatever.
Oh, well,
sorry,
I did think of one.
If they had
some sort
of
predetermined
instruction,
like,
we are the chosen
people
and for some...
You mean,
like the Jews?
Sorry.
Maybe.
I don't know,
just like some sort
of like,
if their culture
said like,
we are amazing
because of X
and then they meet
people who don't
have X,
I would be like,
gotta go,
oh, bud,
you're out of here.
There's something
dangerous about you.
Yeah, yeah.
And by the way,
when I say the Jews,
what I mean is
the monotheistically
religious Jews
who,
as a cult,
believe that
they are the
people chosen
of Yahweh
and that the other
people don't
really matter
or are wrong
or whatever.
Only those people
who believe that thing.
And I think a lot
of religions
have that, right?
Like,
I've heard Christians
say, you know.
Oh, yeah,
the Islamic people,
not the Islamic people,
Islamic fundamentalists
literally believe
that you must
kill the infidels.
Like,
those are just
not even people,
right?
So,
feel free to
set that down
or whatever.
It feels good.
It's a nice
size book.
Excellent.
Yeah,
I mean,
you can even,
you know.
Yeah.
Because it's
perfect for that
purpose,
just to be clear.
Yeah,
there you go.
Take the smartphone
and the book
Protector by Larry
and put them
together and use
them to shield
your genitalia
against any
harmful influences
that it could
otherwise possibly.
I mean,
the book is
literally called
Protector.
It really is
literally called
that.
So,
I'm going to go
a couple places
here.
The first is
there's a really
good reason
to kill
any humans
that come near you.
There's lots
of good reasons.
you can have
visionary knowledge
about what's
going on in the
outside world
beyond your
people.
Imagine that
you are a
people who
has visionary
knowledge and
you can see
what's going on
in the modern
world and
modern people
kept sending
fucking
emissaries to
you and
they're fucking
missionaries and
they're filled
with diseases in
their mind and
their body that
will kill all
your children
forever,
right?
And then they'll
give a flying
fuck about you
and they will
bring cameras
and they will
bring tape
recorders and
they will
bring cell
phones and
they will
bring money
and they will
bring every
fucking lethal
thing that will
obliterate your
people forever.
So you have
visionary knowledge
of this because
either you have
rituals that
create visionary
experience in
your shamans or
your mothers or
the children,
right?
Or nine other
things, right?
You take visionary
drugs or whatever
so you know,
you actually can
see what's going
on in the
outside world
and you know
that any
fucking,
there are zero
emissaries from
that place that
are going to be
okay, right?
If they don't
have the diseases
in their mind,
they have the
diseases in their
body.
If they don't
have the
diseases in
their body,
they have the
technology.
If they don't
have the
technology,
they have
nine other
fuck,
they have
religion,
right?
It's just a
billion things that
will kill your
future.
So you kill every
single person that
tries to enter the
boundary of your
land, right?
No matter what,
at all costs,
right?
If they kill 50
of your men,
you don't care.
All your men,
you'll give them
all, right?
To just take that
people out and
make sure they
don't get in there.
So when I realized
that, that was
mind-blowing.
And we're talking
about protector and
protection, but what
I want to say is
that for most of
human history, it
was impossible to
think about the
world.
And whether what I
said about we are
the only people or
whatever is true,
that doesn't so much
matter.
But there's all
kinds of amazing
stories about that in
anthropology, about
what happens when
other people come.
I want to
specifically mention
Edmund Carpenter,
the book, the book
They Became What
They Beheld, which
is an absolutely
terrifying,
archaeological,
amazing, weird
book.
Here's the problem.
When I was late 17, I
started to have the
transformation of the
urge to protect that
went from the people
that I loved to nature,
herself, and the world.
And then I realized, oh
shit, nuclear weapons.
And then the full weight
of what that actually
means began to
catastrophically infect my
psyche.
And I realized that the
entire history and future
of life on earth is
sitting on a button that
can be pushed not by a
human being, but by
processes that are not
human.
Not human.
They are not answerable to
any authority.
They have no responsibility.
They have no obligation
to life.
They don't fucking care.
And then I have panic
disorder for eight years.
Every time I heard a jet,
I just thought, is this
the fucking moment when
everything dies?
And I knew that there
was nothing I could
personally do to affect it.
And so you can see that
like the cognizant of a
single human, their psyche,
their mind, their
awareness of consciousness
is subject to these
existential threats from
without.
And at a certain age,
males under the
undergo this process
where the protection
should be extended or
would normally extend
to what they consider
the whole, whatever that
whole might be.
Is it my people?
Right?
Is it my family?
But whatever the whole
is, and in my case,
because I'm a modern,
it's like the, it's the
everything.
It's everything.
Right?
It's all the beings.
It's the spiders and the
ants and the bees and the
giraffes and the octopuses
and the praying mantises
and, you know, the whales
and the dolphins.
And they're slaughtering
the fucking whales for
what?
They're obliterating the
oceans.
They're fucking burning
down the rainforest to make
soybeans for soy milk
because being vegan is
really good, right?
Being vegan is awesome.
So let's burn down the
fucking Amazon so we can
plant soybeans to make
soy milk for vegans.
Right?
I mean, like, what the
actual fuck is going on
on this planet?
Any intelligent life form
would look at what's
going on here and just
go like, that is a dumpster
fire of cluster fucks of
the worst shit we could
never even imagine.
Like, what the fuck
actually happened to our
planet?
And I will argue that
what happened is that we
were disconnected from the
library of intelligences that
would otherwise mediate and
sit in the driver's seat of
the bus of our people.
And here we began talking
about how cars were
viruses, but...
Yeah, that's minimal
compared to what the fuck.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so you saying all of
that leads into where I was
going, which is even if
we're doomed,
I'm still...
This is the route I'm
taking.
Yeah, me too.
Like, we're going to save
each other.
I'm going to care for the
people I love.
No matter what the hell is
coming, we're going to act
with integrity and
altruistic awe and respect
and adoration for not just
the people we love, but even
the people we don't know.
And everyone and
everything for always, no
matter what happens, we're
going to keep doing that.
And yet, if we can't heal our
species somehow, if we can't
introduce something that can
out-compete what I call
thrisps, which are these dead
inside malignant processes that
run us, the sclerotic tissue in
the network of human minds that
becomes corporations and
governments and shit like
that, colonization, and
recursive interior
recolonization, which is
going on through, like,
electronic media and shit
like that now, we've got to
address both things.
We can't just do one.
If we love one child, then
we have to make a world for
them that is worth living in
and for.
And I also feel like, I
don't know you can speak for
yourself about this, I suspect
you'll agree with me, I feel
an obligation to the history of
beings.
Like, every being that ever
had a dream, every being that
ever suffered in a prison,
every being that ever
unjustly suffered malignance
from humans, and let's be
really clear, 97% of the
problem around here is just
humans being bad to each
other or the world.
There's no, it's not clear to
me that the universe or time
space is infected with a bad
thing.
It's not clear to me that
that's true.
The humans, something's wrong
with us.
Yeah, it's like a mixture of
having free will that is so
powerful and just completely
going off track with it.
Only at the group level.
I mean, there are very rarely,
okay, what I think about the
individual humans that are
fiercely bad, like serial
killers or serial rapists or
whatever, those people are
usually, they are concentrating
the toxicity in the water of
human culture, right?
So that stuff becomes highly
concentrated, that human
absorbs it, and in a way is
kind of heroic in a sense.
They're still, what they're
doing is evil, right?
Sort of, so to speak.
But if we could use them to
trace back the origins and
then resolve them at those
origins, then that person by
being, by doing those things
would give us the antidote.
We don't do that.
We punish the person.
Like, that's a bad person.
Get that guy.
Put him in jail.
Punish him.
It's an accounting game.
This is banking.
They did the blah, blah, blah,
blah, blah, blah.
So they have to pay the blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
And then we all end up paying.
And then more of those people
spawn because we didn't solve
the fucking problem in our
culture, right?
So it just exacerbates the
whole fucking mess.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And so part of, so my, at some
point in my childhood, it's all
a blur, but I think I can
remember a point and it was
quite young.
I just went to sleep.
I just like checked out.
Wow.
And I was on autopilot for
forever.
I mean, I, it was like my
nervous system had had enough
and I totally just relied on
instinct and like, I, I don't
know.
I don't want to say, yeah.
Anyway, no, no, tell the
story.
I mean, just, it's so
important that you tell the
story because you don't know
how many people have the same
story.
Yeah.
They need to hear you tell
the story.
There was just no conceivable
way.
And of course I wasn't thinking
this consciously, but
retroactively I can see how
this occurred.
It was like, there was no, I
was powerless and I was no
longer able to think or feel
that I could get what I
wanted, which was, I don't
know, like love and in a
certain form and encouragement
in a certain form.
I just checked out and it, I
just went through life with
these processes of, that I
learned how to survive, like
chameleoning in groups.
So I talk to someone and I
figure out what they want,
what they like, and I become
that thing that they desire so
that they like me in return.
And it's, it's like a gross
mimicry of what I actually
wanted, but it was as close as
I could get.
And so manipulation in a lot of
ways was the easiest path for
me to get some semblance of what
I was looking for.
And it was unconscious because
I was like, my nervous system
was activated.
I, I, I was desperately pining
for something that I needed, uh,
that was so fundamental and I
had lost sight that I was even
missing it.
And I, and I was in your body
after a certain point becomes so
tired from that nervous system
activation that it's just, you're
dying.
You're in the process of dying
while trying to live.
And I had many breaking points,
but there was a turning point in
2022 where I came back online and
I was like, Oh, I can go a
different direction.
I can do this.
I can get myself out of these
loops.
Um, and that coming online, that,
that recognizing my unconscious
patterns and making efforts to
love myself and find peace within
was fucking brutal.
It still is.
Why?
Because habits, the more you do it
and then the more comfortable you
get, and especially when they're
linked to your security and safety
and everything you know about the
world, they, there's not a lot of
incentive there unless you've hit
rock bottom enough time, which was
the case for me.
And, and again, this is my story,
which I've heard many people tell
similar stories.
So I know it's, it's a good one.
Um, but yeah, we're for quite some
time suicidal.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Very.
And so talk about that.
Talk about what that felt like, what
was going on.
Well, it just, it didn't make sense to
live anymore.
It was like, I look around the world
and it's as if I'm just, it's, it's
like I'm staring at one of those AI
generated images where you cannot tell
what the fuck you're looking at.
It has like 19 fingers because I
land is whatever you make up.
And there's some faint semblance that
there was life there, but you've
tried to claw it at so many times that
it just hasn't worked.
Um, and, and yeah, it's just, uh,
what was fundamentally missing from
your common experience that would
nourish you enough to want to keep
living or what was missing that was
so horrifying to be without that you
no longer wanted to continue?
I would say meaning was, was probably
the big one.
Um, but I wouldn't have labeled it as
meaning back then.
I don't, I honestly don't even know
what, I probably would have said
something like video games are getting
boring or like, like why, why can't I
just, you know, why, why is it that
my pining for sex and constant
validation, even when it works, it
isn't filling this void inside?
Okay.
That's really profound.
Um, could it be that, I just want to
ask this question because this is
something I think about a lot.
Could it have something to do with,
with the fact that there were no
authentic, meaningful roles for you to
enact and embody and identify with?
Absolutely.
There was, there was a point, I was
such a, I loved being creative as a
kid.
I loved making videos.
I loved playing with Legos and making
stories and there was so much joy to
be had there.
But then just through school and
through socialization, I was like,
oh, okay, everyone is going in this
direction.
This is where the people are going.
I got to go there.
That's where the people go.
And, and it was knowing that college
was up ahead and being like, I had
the story like, oh, college is how I
get money and money is fucking the
best thing ever.
Everyone's talking about money.
We love money.
It's pure liberty.
Yeah.
You were, and watch yourself suffocate
in a bowl of pure liberty called
money.
But yeah, go ahead.
And throughout my childhood, I was able
to get what I wanted very easily.
And if it was not just handed to me, I
would whine and beg and I never
stole.
I, that was, that was something that
kind of unfortunate.
Yeah.
I don't know.
I wasn't, I wasn't much of a stealer.
Yeah.
As a kid, I was a thief.
But, but I, I was able to get what I
wanted and I don't know where I was
going with that.
Uh, everything was handed.
I could get, okay.
I wanted for nothing material, but there
was another dimension of myself that was
absolutely like impoverished in some way.
Right.
Yeah.
That, that, that definitely is true.
And I, and I used the get what I want
game to, cause it was fun.
It was fun to strive after something and
know that I would probably eventually get
it and just, Oh, I'm going to get, I'm
going to get, I get, I got it.
And now it's like, okay, what's the next
thing after I've enjoyed it for enough
time?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I watched a friend, a very close friend,
um, become capable of earning a lot of
money.
And then he became like a novelty addict.
Right.
I want the better food.
I want the better girl.
I want the, what can I buy next?
Right.
And it was not, there was nothing about
that that was fulfilling for him.
Yeah.
So this is why I come back to the idea of
a deeply meaningful role.
I'm actually having a bit of deja vu at
the moment, um, because this is so
primordial for humans.
This is what the indigenous cultures have
that we don't have.
Right.
Or that it's not, it's not really true.
Um, we can, you can build a deeply
meaningful role in this culture and you
seem to be onto sort of the recipe,
which is like something like, or, or
resembles anyway, either it's like one
of my really intelligent friends, um,
Cindy Gale, she used to advise companies
about how to have, how to humanize their
relationships with their employees.
Vendors and contractors so that it became,
she was like humanizing corporations.
Right.
And that was rewarding for a time.
Um, but she's fundamentally a healer.
Right.
And most of us, I think, who ache for this
kind of role, we, we naturally want
so much, there's so much trouble here
because it's a bridge role.
It's a bridging role.
Right.
And so eventually what happens is we just
become bridge people.
And Ryan First Diver is a bridge person.
He bridges like the rattlesnakes,
the animals, the blackfoot people,
the white people, all these bridges.
Right.
Um, but I'm, I'm losing my train of thought.
What I'm trying to get at is
we ache for roles that are meaningful
in ways that defy the impoverishment
of the cultures in which we are brought up.
Can you say that one more time?
We ache for roles that are meaningful
in the ways that they defy the impoverishments
of the cultures in which we are brought up.
Right.
And so it would, it would be natural
that a, that a role that you come into life
to fill would be one where, you know,
there's a gap in that role.
Yeah.
Is that what you're saying?
Yes.
But also like, um, you want to be
a department manager?
Mm-hmm.
Do you?
I do not.
Okay.
You want to sell shoes?
I don't.
Okay.
Do you want to be a stage magician?
Uh, that sounds like it would be fun,
but I don't think it would be ultimately fine.
Why not?
Um, because I've done enough fun things,
jobs like that, things like that,
to know that, I don't know,
maybe, maybe I don't know.
Maybe a stage magician would be
really satisfying for a long time,
or it could transform into something beautiful.
Okay.
Can I just say to you?
Yeah.
That I know enough about you to know
that you would find stage,
you would find, um, illusion,
interesting for about six months at most,
and then you would find it absolutely soul-crushing
because it's just a bunch of gimmicks, right?
And you, and you are not a gimmicky person.
You used to be a gimmicky person.
For sure.
Right?
You were using gimmicks as a way to survive
in human culture,
which was alienating to your soul.
For sure.
Right?
And that's why I think you may have been suicidal.
Yeah.
Well, especially since, um,
I didn't have breaks.
Like, I was like,
oh, I, it just means,
because I didn't have any sort of self-love
or appreciation.
I, like, I was like,
I'm just not good enough,
and so I just have to keep digging this hole
of, like,
I just have to manipulate harder,
get what I want harder.
But,
that, the thing is,
it was tearing up inside,
so I,
I couldn't even bring myself to do that,
if that makes sort of sense.
Um,
like,
like, I really want,
for example,
if I wanted the pepperoni pizza at the store,
and no longer could I conjure up
some sort of illusion to make it,
just, like,
I knew that the,
the only thing I could do
was punch the clerk to get it,
but I couldn't bring myself to punching the clerk,
and so I just suffered.
That's a very strange analogy.
It's a strange analogy,
yeah.
Because you could charm the clerk.
Uh,
not when you're,
I mean,
but once all the life and love
is, like,
out of your,
sucked out of you,
yeah,
it's just,
What sucks it out?
Uh,
it was,
it seemed like a function of time,
honestly.
It just seemed like I was,
I was,
I was withering away,
I was
running against the same wall
over and over again.
What's the wall?
Uh,
thinking that I'm about to get what I want
and realizing that it wasn't it.
You know,
next to it doesn't mean-
Realizing that what you want
isn't really what you wanted?
Right.
The wrong kinds of want.
Right.
And then,
how did that shift?
Um,
well,
eventually,
if you don't kill yourself,
okay,
for me,
if I,
you know,
since I didn't obviously kill myself,
um,
You did undergo death and resurrection.
I did,
I did.
I'm still,
but my body's still kicking around.
Yeah,
right.
Um,
I
went to sleep
again,
but this was a different sleep.
It was a,
um,
I don't know.
If you stay up for 24 hours,
eventually,
you're probably just going to clock out.
Your body's just going to shut down.
That's kind of what I felt like.
Okay.
And so,
um,
I just did the college thing,
and I,
I was depressed.
I kept myself afloat with video games,
and girls,
and,
uh,
well,
that was,
that was about it.
Age?
Range?
I started college right out of high school,
so like,
18,
19,
graduated,
22.
Okay.
Yeah.
And you took what?
Biology?
Biology and chemistry.
Biology and chemistry.
And,
as I recall,
you didn't actually,
No.
complete,
and he's sort of learning curriculum.
No.
You just found a way to,
well,
you tell the story.
Yeah.
What actually happened?
Oh,
this is going to,
if any future employee.
No one's going to know your name.
Just keep going.
You know,
I,
I didn't study.
Uh-huh.
I didn't put any effort.
I just used the same gimmicks
that I used in high school
to pass high school,
but it was just more challenging.
And I never cheated on any tests.
I never like,
whipped my phone out secretly.
It was purely like,
what mnemonics,
what,
uh,
well,
honestly,
most of it was just paying attention in class
and regurgitating.
I,
I really didn't have to put in effort,
you know,
but I didn't learn.
I,
I,
I can't tell you half the shit,
and I,
I think that's a common experience,
but all I would do,
I,
I barely even,
I stopped taking notes after freshman year.
I would just scribble.
Um,
unless it was a math class
where you,
you were dependent on knowing the procedure.
And that's the thing,
I love those math classes.
Calculus,
it was a fucking blast.
I loved calculus.
Wow.
Yeah.
You really,
this is the first time you've lit up
in a long time in the discussion.
Just now,
there's suddenly a spark in your eye.
Yeah.
You say calculus,
and I'm like,
this is leading this,
this is one of leading this,
this is boys over here.
Cause he's just like calculus and up.
Calculus was,
was the class that I,
I put,
I did my homework
and I was excited to do my homework.
That's so funny because,
um,
I think I,
I actually don't know anything formal about calculus,
but from what I've come to understand
as an outsider,
if you don't know calculus,
it's over for you.
You got nothing.
What?
Yeah.
If you don't have calculus,
like of all the intellectual tools of humans
that if they've ever invented,
there's like spoken language
and there's like calculus.
If you're going to have that,
you've done,
you've got nothing.
I can't see why that would be the case,
but I believe it based on my,
my love of it.
So,
but,
but outside of that,
I mean,
I really just paid attention in class,
held it in,
you know,
sealed the lid
and then barfed it over the paper
and forgot about it.
And then,
so girls,
video games,
and then methods.
A little bit of calculus.
A little bit of calculus.
Some drugs.
Okay.
Drugs.
What kind of drugs?
It was just weed.
Okay.
Weed.
And then,
I love that.
Girls,
video games,
calculus,
weed,
and mnemonics
and methods
to get you through tests.
And that was soul crushing.
I mean,
that was truly,
it was like,
oh,
I'm probably going to go
to medical school.
So,
whoa,
I can't wait for this guy
to become a doctor.
That's going to be amazing.
Oh,
and that's the thing.
It's like,
as soon as I graduated,
20 pounds underweight,
and like,
you know.
What was your weight?
I don't know,
like 140.
Okay.
At the time.
I'm 170 now.
Your height?
Five,
somewhere between 5'10 and 5'11.
Okay.
Anyway,
yeah,
I was like,
no fucking way
am I going to medical school.
I liked the idea
because I think
in a similar way
I liked calculus.
I liked the procedure
and the intense focus.
Mm-hmm.
Or at least the idea of it.
And I've watched
enough surgeries
in real life
to know that
I love being
in the operating room.
Whoa,
that's so crazy.
Oh my God.
And I think
I really would
enjoy surgery,
but
I don't think
it would be meaningful
for me.
And I
listened to
a nervous...
Your dad's a surgeon,
right?
Yeah.
Okay.
I listened to a nervous surgeon
talk about
how he was just...
He wasn't solving
people's problems.
He was just
sort of
fixing
parts of their body
that were broken
and
a lot of them
would come back.
The people who healed
were people who had
fixed their diet
and changed their lifestyle
and orientation
that was conducive
to healthy living.
And it was the people
who just didn't give a shit
about their bodies
that,
you know,
the surgery
either was neutral
or didn't help them
or helped them for a bit
and kind of
relapsed.
and so
I'm not
doing a great job
of describing it
but essentially
what I got
from his testimony
was like
he wasn't
doing
the
healing
that he wanted
to be doing
through surgery.
Walk us through
the transformation
and
the
rise and fall
right?
The sort of
I'm sorry to climbing up
and then I crash down
that leads you
from suicide
to
and by the way
are we cool right now?
Are you okay?
Oh, I'm good.
Yeah, I've
done the work.
I've done the work.
Now I'm good.
I'm steamed up.
I'm going to grab
a little bit more of this
but keep talking
and bring us
I'll be able to hear you
bring us through
that transformation.
Okay, well I'll start
where we left off.
So I graduated college
and I pretty much
I would talk to teachers
and I would basically
be like
yeah, medical school
yeah, these are my future plans
but
I knew in my heart
I wasn't going there.
I had to figure something out
and so
I did seasonal work
for a couple years
and
it was better
because
anytime my life got bad
I would just think
oh
I don't have to do
homework ever again.
Fuck yeah.
I'm a free
person.
I can
I can
do
It's so hilarious
because
jobs.
Right.
Right?
Right.
Yeah.
It needed to be saying more.
And
but
I was not
giving my
I was still
largely unconscious
I mean
I was still
wait
yeah
yeah
so
I was working my seasonal jobs
very unhappy
but
at least
I was
out in the world
and I was
recovering from college
I was putting on weight
and I was
active
I worked a physically
demanding job
and so I was getting
exercise
and it was really bad
for my body
but
it's better than just
sitting in a chair all day
What was the physically
demanding job?
It was
working
it was just
moving
driving trucks
and being on boats
and moving
luggage
and food
and all sorts of
just heavy things
propane
operating cranes
it was
it was a fun job
but I was
very unhappy
as a person
so even
even in a really fun setting
it was not
easy for me
and then I did
and then that winter
I worked the night shift
on a mountain
and so
now
after a summer
of
you know
getting to
physical health
and then
overworking myself
I was
up in the mountains
at night
very socially isolated
smoking a lot of pot
and that was
when I first
feel like I came
online again
I had the space
to
I mean
just spending
that much time
alone
forces you
to confront
your own thoughts
at a certain point
and a lot of us
run away from that
and they'll do anything
to go go go go go
because they
there's a part of us
that knows
that when we give
our psyche
the space
it will start
to try to
heal itself
it will start
to try to
unravel
yeah
it may
sort of
what
would I
how would I
put this
okay
give me a moment
sure
it will
redirect
our behavior
our habits
will
it will
cause us
to
draw into
question
our common
habits
and particularly
those habits
that
we use
for deflection
right
to
distract ourselves
to go in
any other direction
but inside
to tell ourselves
stories
to
you know
use the
maxims
that are
you know
like just
you know
just one day
at a time
bro
or whatever
the fucking
maxim is
not that
one day
at a time
is a bad
maxim
go ahead
I'm with you
yeah
and so
one of the
I mean
there were many
things
it's never
just one thing
but one of the
main things
was taking
accountability
for my
choices
and for the
way that I
was treating
people
and for the
way that I
was feeling
that was a
big one
for the way
I was feeling
taking accountability
for how I
was feeling
what do you
mean by
say more about
how you
think of
taking
accountability
accountability
the reason
I ask that
is I have
kind of a
problem with
this idea
of accounting
that's fair
go ahead
that's fair
help me out
for me
it's less
about the
words
and more
about the
feeling
and so
that's
probably
it is
accepting
accepting
how we
feel
and realizing
that when
we point
the finger
at others
and say
hey you're
making me
mad
we are
giving up
our
our freedom
in a way
we are
we are
saying
you control
how I
feel
which
I don't
believe is
true
I think
the way
that we
feel is
certainly
people can
be
stimuli
for
our
emotions
yeah
no
okay
let me
just
let me
just
say
something
about
my
experience
of this
day
sure
right
so
earlier
in the
day
someone
called me
and they
were
talking
very
intensely
about
how
their
primary
romantic
relationship
there was
a bunch
of
accusations
flying back
and forth
right
and what
I
immediately
saw
was that
one of
the people
in this
relationship
was literally
not relating
with the
person in
front of
them at
all
what they
were relating
with
was their
entire
history
of
feeling
victimized
and they
were projecting
that onto
their partner
right
so they're not
even seeing
their partner
right
and then
they're attacking
their entire
history
with their
partner's
face
and then
later in
the day
for myself
to speak
for myself
I was
listening to
Eric Weinstein
being interviewed
by a comedian
who shall
be nameless
and I was
just furious
I was like
this guy is
an imbecile
he doesn't
understand
anything
about being
human
or the future
of mankind
or anything
he's just
an idiot
but what was
really going
on
was
projection
oh projection
I see
right
like
I'm not
necessarily
an idiot
what was
going on
was this
I am
a skillful
doomsayer
I know a lot
about existential
risk and
technology
and humans
this guy knows
nothing about
that
so he was
catering to
my pet
biases
and I was
being very
reactive
I was like
oh I just
need to grab
you and tell
you all the
things that
you're not
seeing right
now
which is
different from
deflection
and a little
bit different
from projection
but I
what happened
is that I
lost my
cognitive
and emotional
and intellectual
sovereignty
I gave up
that sovereignty
in the face
of somebody
that I felt
really it was
really important
to criticize
yep
okay
yeah
and so that's
part of when I
talk about
being conscious
being awake
it was like
I realized
that you can
give up your
power in that
way
you can
you can
just say
oh
you do
these things
and now
I freak
out
and we're
gonna just
play that
dance
yes
you know
yeah
and so
I
very painfully
started to
accept
the wrong
doings
the way
that I
hurt people
and
began to
realize that
they
I did
those things
because I
needed something
and I
very maladaptively
was trying
to get that
thing
and so
I accepted
that I had
done that
wrong
and made
the conscious
choice to
not do that
anymore
and
that's very
interesting
it sounds very
simple right
you just flip
it sounds very
simple
and so
what begins
to happen
is people
in your life
will present
themselves in
the way that
they have
been
and
you will
then
react
in the way
you've always
reacted
and then
they present
themselves
and you're
about to
react
and you go
no wait
don't do it
boom
and then you
react in the
same way
and then
you know
but
every time
we reach
that mindful
awareness
it's a
celebration
it is
it is not
I have a
similar
experience
right
where there
was something
that was
plaguing
my life
and I
kept being
really reactive
to it
and I learned
that I
couldn't
solve the
problem
because I
couldn't
get it
out of
my life
so I
was just
like
you know
what
when I
start
to become
reactive
I'm going
to notice
what's going
on here
I'm just
going to
switch to
a different
channel
I'm just
going to
like channel
seven
right
which sounds
like an
avoidant
situation
but actually
was helpful
because
there's nothing
I could do
about this
there's no way
for me to
affect
the actual
situation
so I
learned
to just
turn
you know
I hear
that
and so
in my
case
I did
there were
things I
could do
that might not
necessarily
be true
they happened
in the past
and what I
was running
up against
was a lot
of guilt
and a lot
of shame
and so
when the
patterns were
occurring in
my present
life
yes I
learned to
be present
understand where
I was going
to go
reaction wise
and choose
to take
a different
route
but I
still was
like yeah
I can do
this now
but think
about all
the people
I've hurt
in the past
and that
was when I
learned how
to forgive
myself
which came
from understanding
that I
am not this
person anymore
I'm not the
person who
would just
unconsciously
do that anymore
I'm actively
working to be
better and
understanding the
reason I was
doing it was
not because I'm
a dick
because I'm
a selfish
jerk
it's because
I wanted
love
it's because
I wanted
all these
things and
I did not
know how to
get it
and this is
how I learned
that maybe
I could get
it
maladaptive
coping
mechanism
maladaptive
coping
mechanisms
okay so
that's really
amazing so
one of the
things I'm
hearing you
say is that
slowly over
time I
recognize these
features of
my previous
life and
behavior
right
and I
I was
trying to
establish a
new
direction
a new
path
and it
was hard
and it
didn't work
out right
away
right
I had to
like fall
down and
fuck up
and make
mistakes and
then like stand
up again and
try again and
this kind of
thing right
yeah yeah
yeah and and
so even in that
process which is
beautiful and
difficult but
really rewarding
it's that guilt
that can sometimes
make us feel
like well you
know hold us
back and so I
learned to
forgive myself
I learned to
alter behavior
that I no
longer want to
enact anymore
and it's still
a process I
am not I'm
not perfect by
any means but
I am better
at it than I
ever was you
know
I wonder what
could possibly
convince whatever
the fuck is
driving the bus
of the human
species to
undergo a
similar array
of transformation
that's what I'm
really interested in
I mean this
circles back to
our original
I and it's
interesting because
for me I got I
had to get to a
point where it
was just rock
bottom that was
like the problem
nothing to lose
yeah no no the
problem with that
for the humans is
rock bottom is like
nuclear war or
bio biological
apocalypse right or
fucking you know
whatever yeah and
and if you're some
billionaire who
you know if you
were if there's
two ways there's
many ways we can
look at this but
let's look at two
of them there's a
billionaire who
just sipping his
whiskey is like I
fucking love stomping
on people I just
love eating those
trees and making
that money man I
fucking love it you
know my late night
jack-off sessions it's
nothing but devastated
forest and polluted
ocean fuck yeah I just
think about fucking
fields yeah miles
long dead human
children and I'm
like yes wow I'm so
hot right now so but
there's the the sort
of weird technological
reflection of that
which is AI I am going
to eat the entire
history of human
cognition and spit
out diamond sperm of
just fucking incredible
unimaginable insight right
I'm going to learn to
fold proteins better
than cells yeah but
well one of the things
Weinstein said it was
like there was some
guy who was a really
brilliant biologist and
the fundamental okay the
fundamental feature of
nature that is absolutely
sovereign is protein
folding that shit is
insane like you can't what
I love what Weinstein said
about this he was like
imagine that you have
like like a transformer
and you have this like
pearl necklace and you
throw throw it up into
the air and it becomes
like a multi weapon you
throw it up in the air
it comes to UFO right or
you throw it up in the
air and it becomes like
19 billion kinds of
transcendent intelligence
you just throw it up in
the air and shit comes
out right and I'm
exaggerating he didn't say
these things these are my
words not his but he was
like this is what protein
folding is an alpha fold
which is I guess I don't
know a Google project
probably has learned how
to understand not just
protein folding but the
impossible part of protein
folding which is what does
protein do right and and
so if you give this power
to this is why I think no
intel no ethical scientist
would publish you would
never give the humans
your findings but AI is
going to give us all the
findings all the time
right and unfortunately
there's no one driving the
car there's like asymmetric
military game theoretical
zero-sum advantage is the
primary motivating factor
for the absence of humans in
our collectives right am I
going with this so I mean
the humans are trying to
invent a god but they're
praying for everything
lethal because they don't
pray they've forgotten what
it means to be together for
each other or for the history
and future of beings or life
on earth or this world or this
solar system because the solar
system is a being it's more
than a being it's it's
something that produces
beings as a as a kind of
minimal side effect of what
it's doing in time space and
the humans have no fucking
idea about this they're
brain dead about these ideas
right they don't ever
consider them the closest they
get to that is things like
religion which are really
weird ideas don't actually get
you thinking about the
purposive aspects of time
space or galaxies or stars or
living worlds or all of these
things or dreaming right
dreaming right leave all that
other stuff aside this is just
look at dreaming think of the
mothers and the children and
the forests and the oceans and
they're dreaming and how that
produces octopuses and whales and
fucking the Amazon and the
mountains you know mount
Everest and the Himalayas and
shit like this right these
things rise up out of time
space ringing with altruistic
beauty that is unutterable
there's nothing you can say
about that could possibly
compare to it right it's it's
the fundamental purpose of the
reason our hearts keep beating
one time again right and
everything that has ever lived
has this urgent orientation and
everything that our species is
doing very with some modest and
brilliant exceptions is
absolutely against us like burn
that down well and so
there's a thing napalm
that's what I'm trying to I'm not
saying I'm actively trying to but
in this hypothetical we're talking
about this crazy fucking
billionaire how do we tap into
that part of them how do we say
hey look this is what you are you
are not some you don't have to be
destroying the earth and here's a
compelling lovely reason here's
let me show you a vision of a
better way a more amazing way that
if you think you were having
orgasms before you were confused
right right and let me give you the
10 second elevator pitch that will
convert you to an to becoming an
ensouled being and so I don't think
people need to hit rock bottom
whipping my book in there that's
awesome I love it the protector I
have never seen a book whip in my
life before that moment that was
amazing yeah this is a novel
fucking well this is what I'm really
about is novelty me too novel no no
novelty yeah yeah I'm beside myself
I'll clean that up later yeah me too
clean it up we're gonna take a
photograph of that and wreck the
internet it kind of looks like Mona Lisa
it does I'm reminded of Rembrandt and
Leonardo if they had sex and made a
feminine counterpart wow well it seems
like I have a future career fuck all
this altruism stuff career
career yeah okay California's behind
me I don't think they have to hit rock
bottom I think no I don't but but
there will I imagine that there will be
a moment if if some billionaire goes
holy shit they're actually able to see
what they've been contributing to and
people love to point to billionaires as
the v problem the one problem there
it's all fucking them but it's it's
all of us in a wrong way but look man
how are we okay well let me let me
okay all right so so how that process of
forgiveness and accountability and we
can use a different word accepting what
has been done that sort of healing I
like the word responsiveness instead of
accountability go ahead that that to me
is what would help I mean if you think
about it hypothetically like if all the
humans just woke up once and we're in
maybe this is totally wrong but if we all
just woke up and we're like holy shit
we're all now on the same page we all
want the same thing and we believe that
we can get there I think it would be a
piece of cake and of course it's a
hypothetical so it's not super you have
no idea how much more on the page what
you're talking about I am than you are
because it's not just the humans everything
in time space wants the humans to wake up
you have friends you can't possibly
imagine the intelligence or power of if
you just move a little bit in that
direction that you got like my ally is
time space bro you got you got a weapon
good for you you know you got lasers and
shit I don't care yeah yeah that that's
such a beautiful way of being is I so
that I'm very interested in altruism I'm
very as am I interested in what that is I
know what it means to me you know people
say love they're like love is the way but
I'm like no mutual concern is the way love
is amazing I love love I'm all down with
that but mutual concern awareness awakening
actually going taking the time to undergo
the processes that allow us to see better
together for each other and the history
and future of life on earth yes I agree it
sounds like a maxim get it but it's one of
my favorite maxims go ahead and and so it's
to me it's not about pointing fingers or
blaming it's like we can work together and
solve this problem and forgiveness for me is
so important because I try to live in a way
where I'm not persecuting anyone I'm not
saying you have to pay I'm not saying you
have to suffer for things that contribute to
the death of the earth I'm saying let's
there's no healing that's required yeah
there's no percentage in retribution
right let's just be clear about that
that's a dead game yeah that game leads to
dead at least it's the prisons US prison
system uh yeah we agree about that that
is a perpetuating excellent cash cow by
the way yeah and an abomination in all of
punishment looks about looks like an
abomination yeah a real abomination not
like the religious guy so you can see like
there's this sclerosis and I'm very
concerned about that there's this
sclerosis in human culture in language
in thought in conception in behavior in
civilization in societies in corporations
and um I think it is okay well I'm not
trying to get anyone on the boat with
Darren's biases or opinion but I am and
here's what I'm trying to say in every
aspect of our humanity where absence has
become a presence there's a thing acting
like a demon and so we need together to
hold each other's hands and walk back into
those absences and rehumanize them slowly
bit by bit to remember what we were and
what we've lost but not to go backwards
not to try to recover the past forge a new
path ahead in which we have meaningful roles and
identities and purposes that we trust and
believe in and explore and develop and
discover together moment by moment step by
step not according to some guy's belief or
some chick's biases or Darren's ideas or any of
that shit we together read we together
piecemeal resurrect our humanity probably
playfully because it when we become really
serious you can see a problem with this in human
history and the future it's got to be a creative
playful exciting amazing way and you know look
we've done that here today in a way right
it's not like this is impossible we have an
example of it here recorded right in our
conversation of us sort of synergizing
together I think I think so too yeah great
so yeah I believe in that as a as a real
direction that we can develop and explore and
establish it's not that hard it's super
easy with like one or two people it gets
weirder when we're talking about millions
of people or hundreds of thousands like
yeah well I imagine snowballing would be
you know the the correct term for that
thinking of bad scenes from the movie clerks
but yeah go um and and so yeah I like the
idea of playfulness because because I have
a hard time believing that you and I let's
get five other people in this room that
all think about this like this we're gonna
we're gonna make an action plan for the
world in this like it just don't know but
I don't believe we can make an action plan
that becomes contagiously playful right
and I think I think I've seen it before
I've seen that happen I know that's that
can that can go down yeah and that's that's
what I'm looking for you know all right I
wouldn't even say I'm looking for it that's
where that's what I'm moving towards that's
what I'm actively walking into I think
there's never been a more important or
catalytically potentiated moment in modern
history than right now for this kind of
thing the humans are there they're fucking
dying and suffocating in place they're just
desperate for some if you could give them
something better to be and do and play at
they're going to just swarm to it the internet
shows us this what are those things like
challenges or what the fuck they call like
you're talking about like the ASL challenge
yeah there's all these ridiculous nonsensical
things that millions of humans do and half of
them like you know 400,000 of them die or
whatever trying to do this thing oh like the
cinnamon challenge yeah exactly like the hot
pepper challenge and some you know 19 people
grow I mean give them something to actually
be give this is what humans are starving
for they want meaningful roles in which
they can have not merely a personal
identity but sort of a transcendental
identity this is part of why when you accept
a monastic role given a new name you're
given a new identity and my son began his
path in Advaita Vedanta yeah I think it's
hilarious that they they gave him the name
Arjuna which is just so appropriate and
ridiculous at the same time what is Arjuna
Arjuna is a that's so hard to describe he's a royal a
royal person who's being spoken to I think by
his charioteer who's actually Krishna or Brahman and
Arjuna's like I don't want to go to war against my
brothers the Pandahars or whatever they are I'm
probably getting this wrong I love all these
beings like I'm not gonna kill I don't want to do
any of this and God essentially in the form of his charioteer and or Krishna or
Brahman or whatever explains to him like you're not you don't have any idea of
what's going on you're really confused and Arjuna asks him to show himself so
that he can understand what's happening and it's I think God or and or Brahman or whatever does do so and then Arjuna like recoils like take it away I don't want to see I can't survive it was pretty common when humans are I've probably got all this wrong but even if I've got it wrong it's okay we have the Theorian yes Theoria Theoria yes The way of seeing a way of seeing right doesn't have to be right
um but anyone can look up you know do research on Arjuna or Krishna or Brahman
and
yeah
and or Brahma and or Brahman or whatever does do so and then Arjuna like recoils like take it away I can't survive
it's pretty common when humans are
I've probably got all this wrong but even if I've got it wrong it's okay we have the Theorian
yes Theoria Theoria
The way of seeing a way of seeing right doesn't have to be right
um but anyone can look up you know do research on Arjuna or Krishna or Brahman
brahman and what was going on a bunch of royal families were about to go to war and arjuna
was the avatar the chosen avatar
we need meaningful roles and ways of playing together that restore and resurrect not merely
our humanity but our transcendental the transcendental urgencies that we bring to our human incarnation
and i've seen the potential of games to do this humans love games and even apparently
the gods like games like it's kind of a universal thing so play seems to be really fundamental
and hopefully we'll develop some some games that give us this opportunity so we we've
now talked about this feels like an excellent like feels like this entire conversation has
been a refinement process and now here's our diamond it's like play how can we play together
for a brighter future and you you knew about this this is how we met i mean our whole relationship
is oriented around play in a lot of ways right without stipulating it and and so how do we
move forward we've we've talked the talk how do we walk the walk what is something that how
would you answer that question um i mean there's some okay look there's some kinds of talk that
accomplish the walk but i think what's going to happen when we draw this specific branch of conversation
to its natural conclusion is that we'll probably make music or we'll start writing something or we'll
make some food together and eat it or you know we'll be human we'll just be we'll do human things
together um and nourish each other and heal each other and call each other to awakening and to awareness
and to anamnesis and to altruistic fulfillment the fulfillment of that altruistic urge that's my
suspicion what do you think you know i i was thinking maybe getting like a four square ball
playing some anyway what you said or whatever like an actual game yeah you know it's it's not
going to be like a zero sun game like chess right well i think there's a reason the nba and nfl are so
popular with humans oh so it's one of the maximum
incarnations one of the highest forms of altruism that i i could see
wait i mean you're so fucking ironic right now like you're completely full of shit you can't mean that
no no i was strike i know no ball games right are literally about sperm and egg all those ball games
like get the sperm to the fucking ovum and fertilize that shit yes fucking raw 500 000 people in a
stadium right going absolutely black match it over a ball going through a fucking what a what you did
what yeah yeah no we're gonna do beautiful shit man we're gonna dream and love and give people ways
to play we're gonna figure out tyler's gonna get involved fuck yeah extinction oddy this is gonna be
nuts dude we're gonna do shit i won't even mention mhn i'm not mentioning that at all yeah i mean it
hasn't come out no we haven't yeah the solution to all problems transform poorly where are we in
the production of that we're right on time we're right on time yeah exactly we have we've dotted our
eyes uh by the way if any listeners have any ideas for games we can play or any or or you know crit
critiques or questions or anything like that we are absolutely inviting you to get involved directly
come to the island of transcendent wonder and human revivification that we have here established
plant your seeds in the soil
we'll just say goodbye to your families don't contact them again uh you're with us now yeah
there's a there's a symbol that you'll see in the comments brand that on your shoulder it's the only
way to be saved yep oh my god it's too cold to you for me
shall we close here i i think this is a good conclusion
yeah i i know i know it's time to end when i'm actively trying to undermine it with stupid humor
me too yeah um there's a drawing i did when i was about eight it's sitting over there
it's a it's a heart that shatters open and there's a butterfly in it and it says good things
come in small packages but fist pock the protector um larry niven's book it's it's worth reading and our
urge to protect life and each other our origins and our future is something i trust i don't trust cults
i'm not trying to be a thing as darren there's something far beyond our personal identity that
i do trust i'm willing to chase together with others of like mind what a nightmare it would be to
for it to be like oh nathan you you were the savior the whole time and uh you were the one to start the
cult and it's all it's all gonna be good from that it's like what what's i don't know that it just
seems like such a shallow uninteresting story yeah by the way if you want to get trapped in
that whole personal i'm i'm gonna be the messiah thing just get born on christmas like me you've
got to make oh my god true it's it's all done all right let's wrap this thing up all right peace and blessings
peace
