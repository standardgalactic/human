Hello, everybody. Welcome. So grateful to be alive and have a body and be a mortal
subject to the possibilities of death and or suffering.
The Buddhists would have us believe that this is the most privileged position in the continuum
of existence as beings, because the gods and the angels and so forth, they are largely
immune to suffering, so they will never awaken. Though it's not a law, it's a principle, right?
Just as there are peculiar humans who are born with the intent to awaken from the strange
library of impoverishments of consciousness and awareness and sensing and developmental
opportunity that plague us as humans. There are children sometimes who are born who immediately
set out on the task of awakening, to liberate themselves from the cycles of, well, often
one says birth and death, but actually it's not birth. None of the things we say are right,
if you can imagine that. Yes, it's much better to not say anything, because as I have often
remarked, the longer I keep talking, the more lying I'm likely to be doing. There's a way
in which particularly the declarative aspects of speech are very dangerous. If we have any concern
for virtue and or veracity, truthfulness. It's not as if there is a the truth. Truth is a direction, not a destination.
Although, if the scope of our concern is limited enough, it can become a binary thing, right? Is true or not?
In any case, I'm very grateful to have this time today and to be out walking in nature with the trees
and the animals and the birds and the young Asian girl who's trying to rescue the crawdad from the
walking path, but the crawdad is very adept at defending itself from being picked up and so she's not sure what
to do and then I come along and I know how to handle the crawdad, hopefully without hurting it and
we all get lucky because the crawdad goes back in the water instead of getting crushed and or eaten
on the path and thus may contribute to future generations of crawdads and fulfill
the promise of the previous generations of crawdads, which in fact aren't even crawdads.
Crayfish they are an instance of the nature and character
and purposive spirit of time-space and the origins of time-space. So in a way that crawdad is the entire universe
universe. All of history and the future localized in one being.
An illusion that the being is separate from other beings.
An illusion. A very trenchant and compelling illusion.
The crawdad looks separate from me. I seem not to be able to know its mind or its senses. I seem not to be able to.
But you see, our cognition, what traps us really is this bizarre expenditure of energy
that is required to preserve the vast, the Alexandrian library of fictions, most of which are lethal,
that we are taught to believe, and to obey, and to subserve, and to promulgate, and to insist upon, and to defend,
and to take offense over, and to complicate in consciousness
from childhood onward. And these are fictions of identity, purpose, origin, function, nature, character,
properties, qualities, characteristics.
I like this one red-haired jogger guy. He's always having an interesting conversation
when I see him, which seems insightful and rich with the possibility of awareness and learning.
He was asking his companion in the conversation whether they feel capable and oriented
to do something other than direct anger at someone in their life.
That's a very powerful question.
Ah, so yes, these illusions, these figments in concept and category and language,
and some languages are much worse than others, ergo, some languages are much better than others.
Hillman will tell us that the ancient Greek is excellent, and I agree.
But languages which preserve the gendering of nouns are also very useful,
and those with which dispose of this feature lose a dimension.
It doesn't matter whether an orange is actually masculine or feminine.
What matters is that the dimension of gender not be divided away and thrown away, right?
In a similar way, we have thrown away the dimension of time, so that we think
that things are continuously one thing, or continuously have one status, or continuously are one person.
A known person, a known person, an entity whose qualities and stati are knowable and known and static, and this is never the case, never.
But language inclines us to treat identity this way, and thus to treat our own identity this way in thought.
And it sets up a very complicated system of banking, accounting, and accusations, threats,
countermeasures, measures, strategies, protocols, games, lethal games.
And whether or not we as individuals believe those games, our cultures and our civilizations and our societies and our nations,
they function according to these fictions that are lethal in that it is impossible for them to have sense.
It is impossible for them to be sane, coherent, aware, trustworthy, compassionate, joyful, playful, developmentally robust,
sustainable, meaning they don't kill themselves, right?
They don't just wipe themselves off the face of the earth every 50 or 100 years,
along with most, if not everything else they can possibly assault.
So we live in this cloud of these fictions.
But, and I think it's important to recognize that.
Today, however, I am beginning with gratitude.
I'm starting out grateful for the opportunity to learn and explore.
And I know it probably sounds like I'm lecturing when I make these recordings.
It's not untrue that I am.
But I'm not merely lecturing because I'm not just reading from the book of things I've known before.
Using my concerns, I'm orienting in the possibility space
of linguistic and intellectual consciousness, logic, insight, thought,
in an attempt to move toward liberation of some kind.
Now, there are different kinds, right?
There are the kinds that put assess, put, they put the kibosh on thought and speech all together.
And they rest in the before
of thinking and speaking.
And most of these are very trustworthy.
They're very profound.
However, if I were just to make a 90-minute recording of nothing,
I doubt my engagement would prosper.
So, in the playground of speaking and listening,
I like to play games
that lead us toward understanding, insight, awareness,
and liberation from some of the traps
that we are otherwise ordinarily subject to.
And, in fact, inclined to preserve
and to entrench together because this is the habit on offer.
This is what is rewarded
and practiced by many of our relational
peers and companions and authorities and so forth.
So, let's do something else together for a bit, shall we?
I have a few ideas in mind.
I'm not sure which one to pursue, but I'm going to go naturally
along some paths
that emerged in an earlier conversation
with my friend, Mr. N,
who I am very grateful to have in my life
and who I met through another friend
who I first had conversations with when he was in Portugal, Mr. R.
Yes, Mr. N is a friend of Mr. R.
And now they are both friends of mine.
And in our conversation this morning,
Mr. N described an extremely peculiar situation
in which he saw a group of,
I don't know if he explicitly denoted their gender,
but I suspect they were either all or mostly male.
And what he described was something I've never heard of
and had no idea could even possibly exist.
So, apparently, at some point in his recent travels,
he saw a group of people, perhaps mostly men,
in strange Orthodox-looking black clothing.
He thought that perhaps they were Amish people
or possibly some sect of Orthodox Jews
and they were riding special bicycles
that travel on train tracks.
And I mentioned to him
that this reminded me of the kind of thing that happens in dreams
where the dreaming aspect of consciousness becomes concerned
that you're going to shatter the dream
by asking some kind of question,
usually about what's going on, quote-unquote, or identity.
Because these sorts of explicit questions
are antithetical to the dreaming aspect
and tend to cause the collapse of the dreaming manifold,
which I think of as a bubble of many bubbles.
And the dreaming manifold likes to keep adding bubbles.
The waking manifold likes to keep throwing them away
to get to what something is, who something is.
Thus, the trenchant Zen question of
what is the sound of one hand clapping?
Yes, it literally is the mind clapping,
what, what, what, what,
against the no hand of the nature of actual identity.
What-ness is the sound of one hand clapping,
but it's also the hilarious on a monopoetic
or poic, on a monopoic pun,
because if you were to try to clap with one hand,
you might imagine that if you were a gnat
or a very small creature, you would hear this
what, what, what, what, what, what,
as the one hand tries to clap against nothing.
Which, when, what, where?
Which, when, what, where?
Why, who, and how are the seven ions of Quest?
The seven-fingered hand of the questioning mind.
Except that I would argue that maybe it's a six-fingered hand
and how is the palm or possibly even the wrist.
How is different from the other ones.
But the other ones are often very deceptive.
So, I argued that sometimes in dreaming,
my son brought this up the other day, he was like,
you know how in a dream if you ask why is,
this is my favorite little dream trope,
I imagine the situation in which I'm being,
I'm terrified and I'm fleeing inside a medieval castle,
part of which has no walls and is sort of outside
while still being a building.
I'm fleeing because a three-inch tall pink tyrannosaur is chasing me
and I think that that thing is basically the
the fruit of evil.
Because in a dream, things can be really weird that way, right?
You can see something and it can be a completely,
you can feel it to be a completely different thing
than it appears to be, thus
a door can be a letter from your friend or,
you know, it doesn't matter.
In any case, I imagine that I'm fleeing
a three-inch tall pink tyrannosaur through
a medieval castle, part of which has no walls
and suddenly I wonder like, wait,
what is going on here?
Now in that moment, the dream begins to enter a superposition
in a way, or a subposition, depending on how you view it.
And I call this moment, I have a special word I made up for it,
I call it a granch.
It's a branch that usually has three primary prongs.
I'll order them collapse to un-collapse.
So the first prong is,
oh, I can't be being chased by a three-inch tall pink tyrannosaur
through a medieval castle that was missing its walls,
but yet it's somehow indoors and it's night, but there's no stars or, you know, whatever.
That can't be happening.
I must be dreaming.
Boom, I wake up.
All right.
So that's one of the branches of the granch.
The second, the third branch, excuse me, the second branch is
the dream does this thing called backfilling, I call it backfilling,
which is it constructs a pleasantly plausible history, a sort of a,
what is the word?
It constructs a pleasantly plausible figure in memory that satisfies the need for an explanation,
but is probably very flimsy in terms of what the waking mind would make of it if someone said that.
If someone offered to backfill that, that way.
And so it's like, oh, yesterday was your birthday and at 9am the pink tyrannosaur rose from the shadows
as it always does and began to pursue you and you crossed the field of lollipops and entered the
mechanical banking apparatus from which you emerged into the medieval castle in your attempt to evade the
tyrannosaur, you know, this kind of thing.
It's very much a construct, but it matches, it sort of, it blurs the pointy ends of the branches
of the question that you forged in such a way that you forget the question and just go on dreaming,
which is what your dreaming mind would really like to do, because waking up is literally the apocalypse.
The whole universe will end.
Even if you're being chased by a tyrannosaur, it's better than waking up.
So the dream will backfill.
And then the third possibility is the gentle intrusion of the understanding that you're dreaming.
And when that intrusion is gentle, it doesn't collapse the dreaming manifold and you get,
you land somewhere in the continuum of lucidity that goes all the way from barely lucid,
the dream becomes stranger and more vivid,
to very lucid, I'm having an out of body experience or astral travel,
to extremely lucid, I'm actually having a full-on visionary event.
And those last two things can be switched around between the middle and the end of the continuum.
It's not clear which things are where in the continuum.
There's just a lot of different potential
topologies that can emerge from the onset of lucidity.
But the backfilling thing is really interesting. What my son said was,
you know, you believe the backfilling of dreaming, the universe ends, the entire universe ends,
and you wake up, boom, and you're in waking consciousness.
And you think you know what things are, where you are, who you are, what has happened,
what the history is, what the future may hold. But why do you think that you're not just backfilling?
Why do you believe that your waking mind doesn't use the same principle
to establish in consciousness an explanatory framework for what happened before you awoke?
And this is a very, very beautiful question. Very profound.
It doesn't matter whether the question is...
Actually, the question is so important that it doesn't matter whether your waking mind does this
or not. It certainly does, is doing some of this, for sure.
The question is liberating. And it's liberating because it draws into question, into quest-ing
ions. Travel particles, transmission particles, exploration particles, discovery particles, ions.
Quest ions. It draws into quest ions the otherwise certain blindness that you call your personal history.
And anything that draws that deeply into question, intelligently, is your friend.
Because that personal history is burdensome, terrifying, compelling,
and will cause you to misbehave if you believe it. Not just with others, but to yourself. You'll misbehave with yourself.
And what do I mean by misbehave? I mean think, act, see, and pretend as if things that can't be true are the most important things
and have to be defended and preserved and enshrined and made statues of in the psyche and the unconscious and the subconscious
and adored and defended instead of living beings, actual relationships, developmental efflorescence,
flowering, right, growth, all of the things, virtue, insight, creativity, play, wonder, joy, ecstasy,
recognition, remembering, remembering, dreaming, learning, seeing, all of the beauty,
all of the virtues, will be sacrificed on the altar of fake suppositions, declarations, identifications, and behaviors.
And no one would ever choose that for even a moment unless they had become completely captivated
in a hall of delusional mirrors established and sustained by tradition and a kind of a marriage
to entrapment, prison-earing, impoverishment, victimization of the self and other.
There's no, there's almost no fiction as compelling as I am a victim for the psyche and for the subconscious.
So we have to be really, really cautious about that particular branch of possibility, I think.
I've seen people obliterate love relationships,
attack their liberators, attack those who adore them,
in order to subserve a figment in their psyche or subconscious or unconscious or all three or more
that presents them as the disabled victim of the trauma in their history.
That, and therefore, there's nothing they have to be responsible for, ever.
There's no, they don't have to take responsibility for any failure.
And successes are impossible because other people.
This is a very trenchant array of fictions
that can destroy entire lineages of humans,
not just a single lifetime.
Whole lineages can collapse under the weight of this fiction.
But what my son was saying was that,
how do you know that your waking mind isn't just backfilling all those things?
Your dreaming mind does it and you believe it when you believe it, right?
It works when it works.
When it doesn't, fine.
But it works a lot.
So why do you think your waking mind isn't doing something very similar
but much more trenchant, much more tangible in consciousness?
And that's a brilliant question.
You know, when Mr. N told me about the bicycle riding black-suited humans
that we might imagine had beards and perhaps curly sideburns
and strange accoutrements
and these bizarre claw-wheeled bicycles
that rode on railroad tracks,
I thought to myself and I thought out loud to Mr. N,
wow, what if, you know, that sounds like the fingerprint
of the non-ordinary right there.
That sounds like what your dreaming mind might do to hide
the, or your, excuse me,
what your waking mind might do to hide the sudden intrusion,
the sudden catastrophic intrusion
of an actual non-ordinary situation
where, for example,
angels and demons are mating together
right in front of you
and you're waking my nose
that the whole structure of your identity
won't survive that.
Like, that's a bridge too far.
Up with that,
we will not put,
in the words of Winston Churchill.
And so,
you can imagine that we must experience situations,
this is the first time I've ever had this thought today,
in which the waking mind realizes,
oh shit,
this is an apocalypse moment for reality.
I'm going to fill in the blanks in consciousness
in such a way that we can continue to go on
with the fictions
of the real waking world
in awareness and consciousness
so that they don't just suddenly collapse
into phantasmagoria,
dreaming,
psychedelia,
the real psychedelia,
not the kind caused by drugs,
the actual kind,
the fundamental kind,
where the mind becomes
enraptured with its own processes
in such a way
that produces
a string theoretical
feed, you know,
yarn ball of feedback loops
that make Alice in Wonderland
look like
an extremely sober transaction
at the
window of the bank teller
on a Monday afternoon
where you deposit $25
and get a little receipt.
Right.
So,
there are situations
we must imagine
in which,
just like the dreaming mind
struggles to backfill
so that the dream is not destroyed,
the dream mind
actually isn't afraid
you're going to become lucid.
It's afraid of what I would call
the dream assassin,
which is a faculty
or a property
of the difference
between
the orchestration
of dreaming awareness
and the orchestration
of waking awareness.
That difference,
if it intrudes
at a sharp angle
it collapses
the dreaming manifold
and you awaken.
That's apocalypse
for the dreaming mind
and the dreaming mind
undergoes that apocalypse
every time you wake up.
Whereas,
the waking mind
doesn't undergo
that apocalypse.
It goes to sleep
but due
to the long
historical
instructuring
of waking mind
memory
very different
from dreaming mind
memory
when it wakes up
it just puts
the same costume
back on
and continues
with the historical
fiction
of personal
social
communal
linguistic
categorical
ideological
political
religious identity.
it just continues
with its
ontological
Halloween
costume
that it always wore.
I am Darren.
What happened
to me yesterday
happened to the same
guy that's standing
right here
in case that's
impossible
there's no chance
of that.
All of these
fictions,
right?
So
what
this brings us
to a syllogism
to the
development
of a syllogism
what is it
that is
to the
waking mind
as the
sudden
imposition
of a
question
or situation
that collapses
the dreaming
manifold
is to the
dreaming mind.
What
X
is to the
waking mind
as the
Y
that ends
dreaming
is to the
dreaming mind.
Now of course
one obvious
answer is
death
but that's
not the
one I'm
looking for
because that's
actually much
more mysterious
and profound
than we
suspect.
We think of it
as just the
end of
everything
or whatever
we may think
of it in a
million different
ways
most of that's
just thinking
unless
the question
has been
answered
in an
Oman Hillman-esque
theater
of
Kaikion
or Theriac
and the
mysteries
and Medea
and the
Medusai
and the
initiation
into death
into the
Aeonic
life
and then
the resurrection
from that
yeah
beautiful
gorgeous
I love it
those are
his
sort of
the
hillmonic
imprimatur
those three
words
beautiful
gorgeous
oh god
love it
yeah
alright
but let's
not lose
our thread
here
while I'm
entertaining
myself
so you
can see
one of the
things I
would say
is that
one of the
primary
one of the
primary forces
of the trap
that we face
in our
waking
existence
is the
transfer of
the expectation
of the
physical
locational
and structural
continuity
of physical
objects
onto their
nature
identity
character
origin
meaning
and purpose
we do
this in
consciousness
we transfer
the
expectation
that my
back at
home
my door
frame
to my
bedroom
is still
in the
exact
condition
it was
when I
left
and I
can
reasonably
expect it
to be
in that
condition
when I
return
we
transfer
that
certainty
onto
all
features
of
ontological
existence
when there
is no
justification
to do
so
and
actually
that
is a
catastrophic
error
in fact
it's a
cascade
of
catastrophic
errors
catastrophic
to what
catastrophic
to
understanding
to
liberation
to
insight
to play
to joy
to ecstasy
to healing
to wonder
to awe
to communion
to recognition
to memory
to
resurrection
of
that which
of
the
essential
the
essentiality
of our
being
together
yeah
so
I also
have often
wondered
what kind
of a
granch
like structure
in waking
consciousness
might lead
to the
waking
consciousness
version
of lucidity
what does
it mean
to be
lucidly
awake
everybody's
fascinated
by lucid
dreaming
I hear
very few
people
if not
no one
other than
me
there are
certainly
others
who are
concerned
with it
I just
don't know
of them
I don't
hear anyone
talking about
lucid
waking
it's funny
the other
day
I was
walking
with my
friend
Nathan
and
we saw
this very
bougie
looking
automobile
that I
had not
seen
before
and
the brand
name
on the
back
of it
was
lucid
yes
I agree
yes
yes
and
well
I guess
so
think
carefully
about what
I said
before
what
is it
what is
that X
such that
it represents
to waking
consciousness
the X
or the Y
that represents
the intrusion
into dreaming
consciousness
of that
which will
bring the
end of
dreaming
what is
that
what is
that
and I'm
going to
argue
that one
realistic
and useful
answer
is
what we
call
a vision
there
were
situations
in a
certain
phase
of my
life
where I
was
in a
very
vulnerable
situation
where
under
certain
circumstances
which I
will not
hear
detail
my
body
would
become
unable
to remain
awake
I would
be forced
into
sudden
sleep
as if
everything
in my
body
was running
away
from me
all the
energy
that keeps
me upright
was running
away from
me
I would
collapse
onto the
couch
and the
moment I
hit the
couch
I would
be in
a vision
and the
vision
would
show me
it was
prophetic
it was
accurately
prophetic
it would
show me
very near
term
features
and
characteristics
of
beings
and
situations
that would
very shortly
arise
such as
someone
say there
is someone
coming to
my house
to assist
me with
a task
right
I would
learn
things about
their
family
their
home
their
history
I'd
be shown
these
things
in
symbols
and it
was not
like a
dream
it was
ultra
vivid
ultra
vivid
in
dimensions
that
aren't
merely
color
shape
or
aesthetic
it's
as if
the
aesthetic
dimension
of the
vision
becomes
a kind
of
meta
information
that
can be
read
by an
aspect
of
our
intelligence
that we
don't
even
know
exists
but is
highly
associated
with
aesthetic
senses
of
style
character
color
shape
form
the
senses
that
attract
us
to
another
human
or
that
attract
us
to
food
or
that
disgust
us
and
affinity
affinity
and
antipathy
these
senses
and
I
would
learn
impossible
things
and
then
I
would
be
able
to
test
those
things
when
I
awoke
from
the
vision
so
one
of
the
answers
to
what
is
to
waking
consciousness
as
the
end
of
dreaming
is
to
dreaming
as
the
intrusion
of
momenta
that
will
bring
the
dreaming
quickly
to
an
end
thus
forging
the
apocalypse
of
that
dream
cycle
what
are
the
similar
features
in
our
waking
experience
and
what
occurred
to
me
when
my
friend
Mr.
N
told
me
of
the
prodigy
he
had
seen
this
is
often
this
word
used
to
be
used
to
refer
not
just
to
a
genius
in
a
person
or
an
amazing
skillful
person
but
rather
what
an
event
a
startling
unexpectedly
profound
moment
in
sensory
experience
where
something
wildly
unexpected
occurs
there
is
a
creature
often
called
a
potato
bug
also
known
as
a
Jerusalem
cricket
it is
crossing
the
trail
I've
never
seen
one
in
the
wild
here
and
I've
very
rarely
seen
them
outside
at
daylight
I don't
know
you know
it's
funny
when I'm
making
recordings
sometimes
I become
I'm
rather
concerned
that
there are
some
things
that are
so
profound
that
your
capacity
to
record
them
or
write
them
down
can be
destroyed
right
come on
dude
you can't
stay on
the trail
little
creature
you're
gonna get
squished
by the
humans
you're
right in
the road
let's
go
let's
go
come on
right
okay
you're
not
gonna
go
I'm
gonna
have
to
get
you
off
the
trail
women
cannot
see
what
it
is
that
has
fascinated
me
on
the
ground
and
in
fact
I
lost
track
of
it
myself
for
a
moment
there
I'm
just
trying
to
make
sure
the
little
Jerusalem
cricket
doesn't
get
squished
by
the
human
feats
which
are
very
clumsy
and
big
and
that
little
cricket
is
very
small
I
don't
know
why
I
suddenly
switched
into
southern
accent
I
can't
find
the
cricket
no more
save
it
I
think
I'm
trying
to
save
it
so
damn
small
it's
disappeared
into
the
terrain
yeah
I
can't
find
it
don't
see
it
right
there
it
is
it's
moving
around
now
movement
differentiates
it from
the
background
in a
useful
way
I
think
most
birds
would really
like to
eat one
of these
because they
got some
juicy stuff
on their
abdomen
okay
well that
thing
looks
safe
now
so
my
friend
Mr.
N
told me
of the
prodigy
that he
had
witnessed
I
thought
to
myself
you
know
that
sounds
like
your
waking
mind
just
covering
up
some
catastrophic
effulgence
of
non
ordinary
like
like a
volcanic
explosion
of
magmic
non
ordinariness
right in
front of
you
and
I
think
it
it just
made
you see
like maybe
your waking
mind
just decided
Mr.
N
your
your
identity
and your
worldview
and the
entire
history
of your
psyche
and your
ego
won't
survive
if I
let you
see
unshielded
that which
is emerging
before you
in
your locale
in your
situation
ingenious
loci
so
I'm going
to paint
some figures
on it
that you
will find
puzzling
but will
not wreck
you
I'm just
going to
paint some
figures
paint
some
orthodox
people
on bicycles
that ride
on railroad
tracks in
the middle
of the
afternoon
with their
little strange
costumes
and things
you might
actually be
seeing people
from
1627
in 2024
you won't
know
you won't
you're going
to be puzzled
but at least
will
buffer
your
delicate
consciousness
and identity
from
from the
explosive
destabilizing
effects
of the
non-ordinary
event
in which
you've become
embroiled
and I'd
like to
think
that our
excursions
are a
similar
kind
of
non-ordinary
event
and I
do
some
work
to buffer
you
against
the
emanations
of the
more than
merely human
perspectives
that I
apply
in
thought
concern
language
speech
so in
a way
when I'm
asking you
what is
the
thing
that is
to
waking
consciousness
as the
intrusion
of the
momenta
that
bring the
dream
apocalypse
is to
dreaming
consciousness
this
is that
thing
we
have
become
that
here
together
right
now
and that's
an amazing
gift
it's a
very
difficult
thing
to
buy
and by
the way
that's
what people
are trying
to buy
when they
go to see
a comedian
or when they
go to see
a philosopher
if they
ever do
that
or when
they go
to see
a rock
band
or when
they go
to see
a magician
right
what are they
actually buying
okay
they're buying
the sudden
intrusion
the safe
and survivable
intrusion
of a
non-ordinary
into their
waking world
awareness
right
they're getting
they don't want
to be destroyed
they don't want
to be driven
mad
but they want
novelty
they want to
experience novelty
because they're
they're suffocating
in the prisons
of dead
knowledge
that our
cultures
and habits
and bizarre
situations
as moderns
create
sustain
nurture
and feed
at all
costs
at every
other cost
right
the humans
will destroy
everything
just to keep
those prisons
and war games
going on
google
facebook
russia
china
united states
south america
drug kingpins
mafias
the russians
cartels
italians
the billionaires
the illuminati
all those
ridiculous
bizarre
figurations
that represent
the absence
of human
intelligence
insight
awareness
memory
virtue
veracity
compassion
that represent
the opposite
of the dreams
of every being
that ever drew
breath on this
planet
those things
are eating
the past
and the future
and everything
they can possibly
get
they're largely
mechanical
tentacles
on
well that's
another answer
that'll
that'll ruin
your waking
mind pretty
good too
right
there's a thing
that is the
opposite of
visionary insight
that is a kind
of a living
death
right
sort of a
zombification
or the result
of having been
bitten by a
vampire
and the vampire
doesn't have to be
dracula
it can be
facebook
it can be
the united states
government
it can be
the court system
it can be
city council
it can be
wokest
legions
of
victim
hearing
revolutionaries
it can be
me
it can be
anything
it can be
an idea
it can be
a concept
it can be
christianity
it can be
islam
and christianity
can also be
the key to the
cage and so
can islam
they're not
just one thing
even though
in many cases
the fictions on
which they are
founded are
thick and
often lethal
so what else
so what else can
mess up the
waking mind
well
in a sense
this thing
we call
insanity
which is a
very broad
catch-all term
not particularly
useful
that thing's
really dangerous
it's also
part and parcel
of prodigy
inspiration
and creativity
getting outside
the cage
is where
art
comes from
and insight
and discovery
even scientific
discoveries like
the amplituahedron
and
hamiltonians
and
gadelian
incompleteness
and the square
root of negative
one
complex numbers
and
you know
eric weinstein
who says
the square root
is the psychedelic
of math
and if you look
on my medium page
you'll see a little
dissertation by him
on this topic
which is well worth
having a peek at
mathematics
the weird thing
about science
is that when it's
when it's done
really well
and weinstein
would argue
that even when
it's done
poorly in the
right way
it becomes
better than
psychedelic drugs
it will introduce
you to features
of the real
that are so
astonishing
that psychedelics
are boringly
trivial
in comparison
the results
of psychedelics
are boringly
trivial in comparison
if we mean
by psychedelics
psychedelic drugs
my frenemy
Dr. B
someone who
probably doesn't
want me to
name him
based on his
associations
with very
famous people
he
will say
things like
if you really
want to have
your mind blown
forget about
making stuff up
in dreams
and visions
and things
just pay very
careful attention
to what we've
discovered
using the
the toolboxes
of logic
math
science
and our
thirst
for
true
knowledge
right
which
which we
might call
justified
true belief
but there are
other more
sophisticated ways
to think of it
and what he's
actually saying
is
the wildest stories
of religion
and metaphysics
and psychedelia
and art
are like romper room
compared to the actual
strangeness
of for example
the amplituahedron
or
gedelian
incompleteness
or
romanian
geometry
the geometric
algebras
grothendikes
inclusion
of the mathematician
and the math
all of these things
there's a
there's a universe
of staggering
science fictiony
endless
infinite weirdness
that's vastly more
strange than
all of metaphysics
if only
we would
entertain
it in consciousness
so there's another
answer
to what is
to the waking mind
as the intrusion
of the momenta
that lead to the end
of dreaming
is
are to the dreaming
mind
now
obviously
psychedelic drugs
are one answer
they're not one of my
favorite answers
for lots of reasons
people are referring
to these as medicines
these days
that's not entirely
wrong
but it's very dangerous
for moderns
because they're
misguided in their
application of these
medicines
if they're guided
at all
mostly
mostly
there's exceptions
you know
Hillman talks
about the venoms
of snakes
reptiles
amphibians
insects
poisons
from plants
various kinds
of dusts
dyes
and things
all of these
are historically
profound
catalysts
for the
forcible
transformation
the forcible
and often
sudden
transformation
of waking
consciousness
into something
bordering on
either dreaming
or death
or both
oh yeah
there's the
woman
who
and then
we have
the broad
endless
library
of
destabilizations
of waking
consciousness
that we think
of as
insanity
the word
sane
means clean
just to be
clear
etymologically
so essentially
it means
uncleanliness
and you might
imagine it
as a situation
in which
the inputs
to thought
consciousness
concern
and purpose
in awareness
the mouth
if you will
of the mind
becomes connected
to its own
genitalia
and or
anus
and so
the output
the stuff
that you want
to get rid
of
hygienically
or metabolically
in terms of
cognitive metabolism
right
that stuff
you want
to get rid
of is being
reintroduced
directly
into
what
awareness
thought
concern
and purpose
imagining
figuration
exertion
meaning what
you choose
to pay
attention to
the little
bits
of the
possibility
space
that you
choose
to pay
attention
to
is
exertion
the out
the stuff
that you'd
be trying
to get
rid of
that you
could think
of as
poop
cognitive
poop
or
imaginal
poop
these things
get reintroduced
as food
or
orienting
new
grist
for the
mill of
the mind
so to speak
and that
creates a
feedback loop
and most
forms of
insanity
quote unquote
in fact
actually the
nature of
consciousness
is just a
feedback
situation
recursive
reintroduction
of
stimuli
so
all of
these things
yes
insanity
psychosis
delusion
most of
us have
had the
experience
of becoming
so focused
on one
possible
future
situation
or outcome
that
we are
essentially
unavailable
to our
own
life
mind
relationships
situation
home
overthinking
is
a word
we use
to describe
this
most of
us are
familiar
with it
under a
situation
of
high
stress
or fear
or injury
or all
three
including
isolation
because
isolation
is a
kind of
injury
for most
of us
a lot
of the
time
not
always
certain
features
of our
cognition
can get
spun up
and sort
of feed
on their
own
output
right
produce
feedback
loop
like the
kind of
thing that
happens
when a
guitar
player
puts
his
the
pickups
on his
electric
guitar
near
the
amplifier
high
which
is
producing
which
is
producing
the
music
amplifying
the
sound
of the
instrument
that's
being
played
so the
input
and the
output
create
a
recursive
loop
that
quickly
arcs
toward
infinities
of output
and one
might imagine
explodes
in fact
an explosion
is really
an explosion
of any
kind
including
the really
dangerous
kinds
like
the
nuclear
ones
are
they are
iterative
wave
like
expressions
of
a focused
phenomenon
having
overcome
the
boundary
condition
under
which
it
remains
stable
think
carefully
about
that
because
our
consciousness
is also
wave
like
and there
are
situations
that can
overcome
the boundary
conditions
under which
it remains
stable
and it
has
defenses
against
that
and it
will bring
those
defenses
into
play
backfilling
and dreaming
is one
of them
sustain
the dream
not at
all costs
right
the dreaming
mind
isn't like
the waking
mind
in this
case
the dreaming
mind
isn't
as
what we
call
severe
and fervent
and
urgently
motivated
to continue
its dominance
of the situation
the way the waking
mind is
thus
you know
if your dreaming
mind was like
that your dreaming
memories would
literally be a
second identity
and the concept
of superman
and of superheroes
and all of these
things
these are symbolic
representations
of the dreaming
mind's
willingness
to not
dominate
the situation
even though
its powers
are vastly
monumental
outweigh
the powers
of the waking
world
intelligence
faculties
in fact
those waking
world
intelligence
faculties
depend
in their
basis
on
assets
nurtured
established
and
intelligently
and
structured
by the
dreaming
mind
there would
be no
waking
mind
if there
was no
dreaming
and the
waking
mind
thinks
well
you don't
need that
dreaming
thing
I like
to make
machines
and war
things
and fuck
shit up
and blow
things up
and put
bullets
and bales
and stuff
put things
together
I'm the
maker of
things
I'm the
one that
counts
well it
wouldn't
exist at
all
if it
wasn't for
the
liquid
cloud
like
fluid
basis
the
emotional
beautiful
childlike
wonder
and
anciently
conserved
intelligences
that are
liquid
and flowing
and belong
to the
other aspects
of our
awareness
and consciousness
not just the
dreaming mind
the before
of both
the before
of the
division
between
them
is a
thing
that's
very
difficult
to point
at
but is
has
primacy
here
so
yes
I think
now it's
entirely
possible
that someone
who's
listening
will either
know or do
some research
and find out
that there
are strangely
garbed
people
who ride
weird
boaters
weird
excuse me
bicycles
on things
resembling
train tracks
in some
part of
the
eastern
seaboard
of the
United
States
in the
afternoon
and they'll
come back
and go
oh yeah
you know
those are
just
blah-bity-blahs
those are
the
visitors
or the
that-it-ers
these people
who do
this
and they'll
think
unfortunately
because their
waking mind
is dominating
them
that they've
solved the
mystery
and there
are no
such
situations
where the
waking mind
has to
scramble
to produce
an illusion
to try
to keep
the entire
structure
of your
identity
and ontological
framework
and categorical
lexicon
from being
irrevocably
and permanently
violated
forever
and yet
if we
were truly
aware
encountering
any organism
would have
this effect
upon us
immediately
because there's
nothing
that's not
ordinarily
astonishing
as the
living being
in time
space
infinitely
astonishing
wave
after wave
of
unjustifiable
novel
astonishment
we call it
a bluebird
a praying
mantis
a mouse
the rattlesnake
oak tree
the mountain
the star
the moon
the sun
all of these
phenomena
are exactly
the thing
that would
obliterate
the lethal
library of
fictions
that
suppose
our human
intellectual
ontological
and epistemological
supremacy
these would be
completely
destroyed
by actually
attending
the existence
of an
ant
or a
mouse
of course
nobody wants
those things
destroyed
well that's not
true
some of us
do
and that's
why some
of you
are listening
ah
okay
where are we
going here
there's a
path
I'm using
a compass
to find my
way through
the possibility
space
I want you
to ask
yourself
what
on the
compass
that Darren
is using
today
and in his
previous videos
what represents
true north
because it's not
merely truth
though that's
important
it's not merely
virtue though
that's important
maybe there's no
single thing that
represents true north
maybe what represents
true north
for Darren
in his orienteering
orienteering activity
is a
hyperstructure
of originary
concerns
that orient
the nature of
existence
and beings
and minds
themselves
but imagine
if you will
a phenomena
so dangerous
that it
threatens to
obliterate
the
the
interior
catholic
church
right
it threatens
to obliterate
the pope
it threatens
to obliterate
the cathedral
in Rome
whose name
for some reason
evades me
at the moment
maybe
maybe my
maybe my
waking mind
is protecting
this
asset
from attack
it threatens
to obliterate
imagine that
you see
something that
there's no way
your identity
or your
understanding
of reality
your entire
value system
your belief
in the continuity
and comprehensibility
of human experience
the whole
representation
the layer
of consciousness
in which
representational
cognition
reigns
supreme
if you encounter
something that
threatens that
whole substrate
that whole layer
thus also
threatening your
identity
in everything
you've ever
thought or
believed
in every
justification
for every
action
that you
ever attempted
to justify
with an
argument
or an
evaluation
or an
analysis
or math
if something
showed up
in your
experience
that had
the potential
to violate
all of that
what would
you do
how would
you respond
would you
cleave
interiorly
to all
you've known
before
all you
have believed
the
philosophical
and ideological
and relational
and evaluative
foundations
of your
normality
your normalcy
your
domestication
or would
you instead
arch your
neck
in the
direction of
liberty
and raise
your brow
toward the
light on the
horizon of
consciousness
that represents
a
catastrophic
infinite
cascade
of jail
breaking
liberations
the effect
and
sequelae
of which
the repercussions
of which
are unknown
you know
all too well
the familiarity
of the cages
in which
your waking
mind
has traversed
it's
has
circumambulated
its little
prison cell
over and over
again and
reassured itself
of the
position
of every
bar and
every lock
and every
system
that therein
traps you
and thus
traps your
ancestors
and thus
traps your
progeny
and thus
traps the
universe
and how
belovedly
familiar
are these
cages
to us
the cage
of Darren
his history
his personal
history
his knowledge
his accomplishments
his failures
his creations
the things
he takes
credit for
the things
he prosecutes
others for
i don't want
you to think
the waking
mind is a
bad
being
it's not
it's just
very problematical
for us
because it
it's largely
in service
to what
to the
prisonering
aspects
of human
culture
language
behavior
tradition
gatekeeping
all these
things
would you
arch your
would you
arch your
neck toward
liberty
would you
really
and if you
think there's
no phenomena
that does
this
just understand
that every
sunset does
this
i mean there's
very simple
phenomena that
do this all
the time
but
an earthquake
will mess
you up
for sure
solar eclipse
thunderstorm
mess you
up
your waking
mind can
readjust to
those presuming
you mostly
survive them
a volcanic
eruption
will rock
your boat
but there
are phenomena
that we
don't really
have
the phenomena
that actually
mess up
our
okay the
phenomena that
attack the
bases of
our lexicons
that we use
to determine
the categorical
identities
of beings
and situations
and characteristics
and values
and directions
and temporality
time especially
these things
are delicate
in humans
minds
and cultures
and anything
that attacks
them can
destroy
our minds
it can destroy
the possibility
of having
minds
at all
that's something
that i'm going
to get to
in a minute
though because
i want to
i just want to
reel back
the line
a little
bit
presuming i
can continue
this very
dangerous
tightrope
walking game
i'm playing
in my own
consciousness
right now
in an attempt
to chart
a course
that leads
outside the
prisons
the categories
okay
so we have
this topic
which used
to be called
ufos
and is now
referred to
as the
phenomenon
the phenomenon
i always get
those two
confused
it's really
fun to
confuse them
i can't
i just can't
quite remember
i think
phenomena
is singular
and phenomenon
is plural
but it could
be the other
way around
i just can't
really tell
i love when
humans are
having really
animated
conversations
together
i love animation
i mean
animation's
ecstatically
wonderful
to be human
is astonishing
even in
relatively
dark
circumstances
it is
amazing
i know
you want
to touch
that animal
but it
won't be
happy
like
i could
give you
a peanut
and you
could attract
it but
it won't
go well
okay
that guy
was funny
because he
knew
he was
he was
edge walking
right
he wanted
the attention
of the squirrel
but he also
knew that
the fulfillment
of his
of his play
would be
disastrous
now that
there
that weird
situation
where
you're in
the liminal
space
where you're
inviting
apocalypse
and you're
edge walking
toward it
but you
don't intend
to invoke
it
and you're
carefully
avoiding the
invocation
the moves
that will
cause
the collapse
that becomes
unavoidable
which is what
i'm doing
here
because i'm
doing the
same damn
thing i'm
talking about
i used to
have a
neologism
to point
at this
behavior
where
what you
are saying
becomes
the
inaction
of
what you
are
speaking
about
there's a
way of
speaking
i'm
doing it
here
where you
accomplish
the thing
you're
describing
the things
you are
saying
become
the
accomplishment
of that
which you
are
describing
so we
have this
thing
we used
to call
it
probably
the first
thing it
was called
in modern
times and
it was
called
other things
long ago
was
flying
saucers
think very
carefully about
the words
that are being
used here
flying
saucers
that
later
became
ufos
unidentified
flying
objects
which
further
transformed
now you
can see
what's
going on
here
waves
of
experience
are
impacting
on the
core
of our
lexicons
right
the
foundations
of
identity
and
consciousness
the
core
the
root
of the
possibility
of having
a lexicon
at all
and that
becomes
UAP
unidentified
aerial
phenomena
or
unidentified
anomalous
phenomena
phenomena
phenomenon
can't remember
I'll get it
I'll learn
again later
and then
that
simply
because
of how
robust
and complex
what's
going on
is
turns out
to involve
things like
telepathy
UFOs
near death
experiences
a broad
array of
psychic
phenomena
such as
telekinesis
synchronicity
high
strangeness
of various
kinds
things in
the sky
that aren't
stars
aren't
spaceships
aren't
all they
are is
they're
like
they're
like the
standing
violations
of the
possibility
of
categorization
think about
that
okay now
anything that
does that
draws the
entire category
tree into
question
and anything
that draws the
entire category
tree into
question
can be
weaponized
and has
been
weaponized
and is
being
weaponized
we'll get
to that
later
anything
anything that
so there
are these
root ideas
that are
concepts
and the
possibility of
forming a
coherent tree
of identity
is rooted in
and if you
mess that up
humans
go nuts
now there
are ways of
messing that up
that lead to
enlightenment
not just
insanity
Alfred
Korzybski
with his
non-Aristotelian
logic was
trying to
invent a
coherent way
to compromise
the basis
of identity
hilariously
to protect it
from the
kinds of
compromise
it must
otherwise
continuously
be subject
to
hilarious
I'm going
to compromise
the basis
of identity
in such a
way
that we
acquire
immunity
to the
entire
library of
compromises
that must
otherwise
ensue
this is a
truly heroic
intention
a brilliant
intention
from a
half-mad
genius
who must
have really
adored the
world and
humans
even though
some of
what he
said was
complete
nonsense
so
the
non-Aristotelian
assertion
the
Aristotelian
assertion
first is
A equals
A
a tree
is a
tree
it is
never
not
a tree
Korzybski
said
no a
tree
is never
a tree
whatever
tree
might be
it can't
be this
word
tree
it can't
be the
concept
tree
it can't
be the
category
tree
whatever
it is
is something
far
beyond
anything
that we
can
possibly
encapsulate
in cognitive
behavior
that is
trustworthy
and veritable
there are
exceptions
there's a
sort of
a yes
but
version
of general
semantics
but what
Korzybski is
trying to do
is to get us
to see
through
the terrifying
prison
of categorical
identity
and its
lies
because
because all
events
or
reference
or
nominata
right
the
event
the stuff
that language
points our
attention toward
if I say
there is a
dog
the dog
the actual
event
that I'm
pointing at
with the word
dog
the situation
I'm pointing
at
circumstances
I'm pointing
at
are never
static
and they have
infinite qualities
and they have
infinite associations
and infinite
relationships
so how can we
snip that off
and go
oh no
it's a dog
and then think
we're right
that rectitude
that desire
for cognitive
and categorical
rectitude
what is that
is really
dangerous to
anyone who's
trying to be
actually intelligent
or to become
intelligent
you don't want
to throw the
whole system
away
that just
leads to
incoherence
you need to
navigate within
the system
in a way
that both
recognizes
its
frail
and fictional
foundations
and yet
can make
moves within
that
that are
trustworthy
useful
lead to
insight
liberation
development
play
growth
ecstasis
ecstasis
wonder
discovery
and so forth
so you can
play
in the
field of the
fictions
as long as
you don't
take them
very seriously
once you
realize that
their foundations
are confused
or baseless
you can then
play freely
with them
without being
trapped
by them
or in them
depending on
the degree
to which
you have
truly
understood
their
baselessness
and established
that baselessness
in your
awareness
the UFO
phenomenon
is a
reality
violating
phenomenon
it violates
the entire
what we call
the phenomenon
right
violates the
entire library
of human
lexical
referent
objects
tokens
it
throws
the
whole
kit
and caboodle
into
cataclysmic
spasms
of failure
right
like
imagine
imagine
if our
understanding
of identity
were to have
an epileptic
fit
that's what
the UFO
phenomenon
does
and this
is what
I'm
suggesting
Mr. N's
mind
might have
been working
very
diligently
to
counteract
the effects
of
unconsciousness
under
a
situation
where
the
foundations
of conscious
coherence
are at
risk
the waking
mind
will
backfill
it
will
make
stuff
up
and it
will
paint
over
reality
and try
to get
us to
see
something
that
might
be
puzzling
but won't
obliterate
the entire
history of our
identity
thought about
identity
nature
meaning
humans
animals
the sky
the sky
the earth
the world
dreaming
all these
things
they all
are linked
together
and as long
as they're
very limited
in what
they mean
each of
these words
we feel
safe
we know
what to
expect
we don't
have to
become
we don't
have to
overthink
it
we don't
become
hyper
vigilant
etc
so
this is
what the
humans
have been
practicing
and it's
as lethal
as it is
effective
it's also
unfortunate
because our
actual nature
is utterly
transcendental
to these
concepts of
category and
identity
completely
transcendental
to them
to the
degree that
quantum
physics is
transcendental
to
I don't
know
a photograph
of a light
switch
I guess
they both
partake of
a similar
phenomenon
but yeah
I mean
this is just
not the same
thing at all
we are not
what we think
of as human
what we
actually are
is so
radically
self-transcending
that it's
unencapsulable
it would
obliterate
everything we've
ever thought
or believed
all of religion
all of science
all of language
it would just
lay
smoldering
rubble
is all
that would
be left
of those
things
human ways
of knowing
obliterated
so
this is
part of
what we're
trying to
protect
ourselves
from
with
language
and
concepts
and
predictable
static
identity
things
negative
heter
code

2020
a child was frozen in a pose a theatrical pose frozen calling out to his father who was taking
a picture of a statue do you understand what i'm talking about think carefully about what i just
said and the child's making this call bah bah his father's photographing a statue the child is
frozen in space in a theatrical pose calling to his father what a beautiful example of the motivations
of human cognition and everything i've spoken of today with one exception the weaponization let me
be clear if you were to see for example something that isn't supposed to exist an angel a god a
diamond a daemon a deva a jinn a ufo the dead your mind would try to paint it over in such a way
as to protect you from the repercussions of having seen the unseeable that which must not be
why must it not be it must not be because the regime of the supremacy of the categories and language in
waking consciousness must never be violated by anything that exists that supremacy
must be maintained at all costs including the cost of apocalypse and that supremacy is what will
destroy our world and every living thing on it because our collectives are oriented by a similar fictional supremacy
and they will defend it against everything alive they will see organisms as the absolute enemy
because of their novelty and their transcendentalness to those lexicons to those categories to those names
this aspect of the what the gilchrist might call the emissary that has become
a ronin that is trying to overcome its master
imagine the finger that attempts to dominate and destroy the sovereignty of the body it's the same kind of
problem in cognition and in consciousness so this is what we're facing this is where we are as humans
in this terrible
quad you know multi-polar trap as uh schmachtenberger daniel schmachtenberger so brilliantly describes it a
multi-polar trap
it's not merely bipolar right if it were bipolar we might be able we'd have a shot at resolving it
no it keeps adding new polarities as we attempt to resolve it it's it's um
it is uh
what is that dragon
that has so many heads
and just keeps breeding heads
if you cut one off to grow there
um is it no it's not the gorgon that's a medusa
you know what i mean
again my mind is because of what i'm trying to do with it i'm trying to
i'm trying to use the faculties of my mind against yeah in service of the path
that grants us liberty from from the traps that language itself naturally forges simply by speaking
um the hydra
yeah this is the problem
you can't cut the heads off you have to deal with this problem in a different way
a multi-polar trap can't be dealt with
by attacking one or two heads or something it just doesn't work
all right so
we've seen amazing vistas here today
the thing i want you to understand is that if you were to see in the sky a thing that is transcendental
to human categories what would what do you suppose your mind would do do you think you
would see what is there no you will not see what is there in fact it might be impossible to see what is there
and the humans are going to try to tell you that it's this or that it's an invading force from
time space it's demons it's they're going to try to fit it into the existing categories
but what it is is
a ladder that leads beyond the possibility of the supremacy of the categories in which we believe
right it is an escape hatch
what eric weinstein might call a panic room where the universe comes down taps you on the shoulder and
says little children
the toys you have been playing with
are too primitive to carry you forward to your next developmental phase
leave them aside let us show you new ones that's what it is
and that always happens in a developmental arc
often when this occurs what the beings involved do is they ironically turn around and look back
toward history and turn to salt so it's in the biblical story right
where sodom is being destroyed and lot is leaving with his wife and they were told not to not to look back
it's like these two adults their little daughter she's pushing her carriage they've got their little
dog they're walking across the street it's just astoundingly gorgeous it's like the whole universe
vulnerably expressed in a in a localization
of fragility and love and continuity and hope and faith and danger and
it's so beautiful uh yeah so this phenomenon
is pointing at the inadequacy of our categories when you hear people trying to cram it into some existing
category i think lou alisando recently said that uh
that there's every sign from this that an invasion is imminent what a load of
bullshit my god no wonder people mistrust lou that's one of the dumbest things i've ever heard
if that happens you can be sure that's a human psyop
in an in a last-ditch attempt to maintain the supremacy of the war categories
that have crippled and obliterated our people our history and our future
for you know billions of human lifetimes because there's a there's eight billion humans right now
so people go like what do you mean billions of lifetimes there's only there's only been a few
million lifetimes no wrong in 10 years there's eight billion lifetimes right now i mean
over a hundred years now well actually let's let's let's shrink the the scope a little bit more
appropriate over 60 years say from uh 1970 i don't know 80 90 2000 10 20 it's 50 1960 to now let's say
there are billions of humans have had lifetimes right billions of human lifetimes can happen in a
hundred years follow so for billions of human lifetimes we've been tortured and terrified by war
and commerce and colonization and progress and technology but but have abject failure to
establish anything resembling an intelligent human society and you got people like eliza elizana
telling you like you know those things in the sky hey they seem to portend an invasion of some kind
yeah and well it ain't a military invasion let me tell you that much and whatever might be existing
in time space is probably a lot less dangerous than anything you've encountered as just being a human
being because human beings individually and in small cohorts are amazing and beautiful and lovely
but in large groups or societies or nations where they've been captured by these lethal processes that
i sometimes call thrisps but you can just call um corporate
they're the deadliest thing you can possibly find and there's nothing in space-time as deadly as that
so don't be afraid of the sky be afraid of the zombie roboticized humans that are obeying nonsense
in language and culture and obliterating the planet and each other and those beautiful families like the one
that i saw for the sake of fictions in language or for the sake of the superiority of a cons of a conceptual
framework of identity and value that is terrifying that is terrifying but the phenomena
is the lighthouse that leads beyond the possibilities of the categories we've come to trust
and this leads me to the tail end of my of my exploration today which is the weaponization
of the human capacity
to derive identity at all
you see it turns out that in terms of military advantage if you can go after
i'm going to back up and say one thing before i leave the topic of the ufos
if you were to see something that you can't see your mind will paint it over with something that might
be puzzling but you can survive it clowns in silver suits were in the trees
you know as the days go by there's there's a ufo encounter story where the first parts of the first few
phases of the story are very weird and don't make sense right but as the story progresses
it becomes more and more like space travelers or time travelers or space time travelers or
multi-dimensional travelers interacting with a human family at a farmhouse
and so what will happen is that if you're allowed time your mind will paint over it less right it will
backfill less and less and less over time because it's buffering you from the sudden shock of
interdimensional beings are trying to interact with you right now in your front yard
or you know also if beings from outside time are trying to interact with you you have to understand
that what's going on there is a collapse of time space it's not just beings from it's not just
weirdos from another dimension are here no no no it's two dimensions of reality are meeting and warping
together that messes up time it messes up the possibility of identity it messes up physics it messes
shit up it it it does not sustain the previously sustainable sovereignties of thought expectation
identity form none of that all that stuff goes out the window right so we have to think carefully about
this in thinking about how the humans are responding to unidentified anomalous phenomena
uh i love that unidentified right we're basically straight up saying like we can't categorize
it anomalous can't it's like saying can't categorize can't categorize phenomena
or even we can't categorize uncategorizable phenomena
um and you know the the sort of um
the uh the magistrates of identity are saying well there's no evidence that it's weird
it's just things we don't have enough data about if we had enough data they'd fall into the categories
we expect them to balloons and venus and marsh gas and uh you know virtual drone things and led lights
uh you know it's an ai artifact in our minds blah blah blah okay great good luck
um that's bullshit that's true for you know some 70 percent of
maybe the commonly reported stuff it's not true for the rest of it there's a whole branch of reality
that doesn't fit in the category lexicon at all and it it violates that lexicon it violates everything we
think and the reason it violates everything we think is that most of what we think is puerile
it's childish um it has nothing to do with the nature of what's going on our nature nature's nature
the meaning of the sky the nature of origin intelligence minds nothing to do with any of that
right nothing it's made up to shield us from that
um
i've got to walk away from the music for a moment and i'm in a i'm in an echoing
tunnel imagine that you're in a universe and your bones are lighter than toothpicks and the slightest
breeze of reality will blow you up into the sky so what do you do you hide behind shields
you make shields in language and concept and category and you hide behind them to protect you
from that weird wind that will suck you up into the great mystery of the sky and this is what the
humans have been doing at least since the relationships with the sky intelligences were broken
and also with the dead right not just the sky intelligences but with the dead and with the
sky intelligences both of these things got broken the humans went nuts and they started making shields
and hiding behind them
yeah poor humans all right so here's the other problem
when faced with phenomena that you can't
um structure in consciousness your waking mind is going to protect you from it and it's going to do
that by painting over it so that you will literally see something that isn't there
because if you were to see what is there
quote unquote it would drive you mad
what does madness mean well it depends but it's not going to be good for you in most cases because
you're not prepared to go outside the well-trodden pathways of your cognitive and categorical history
um all right now what if there were cultures on earth humans groups of them that want to drive you
mad how might they do that well one of the ways they would do that
is they would weaponize this potential that i've been talking about to face you with things that you
can't know what they are there was a phase in 2022 when regularly in the news feed on the mobile version
of facebook there would be advertisements for objects and this is a sliding horizontal bar with maybe
12 sequential objects left to right
and you can slide the bar and you see a new object and these are objects that are for sale
well not only could i not tell what those objects were
i couldn't tell what kind of object they were and i'm a technician so i couldn't tell like is this an
object that fixes cars is it a computer thing what is it i couldn't tell what they were i was
facebook was attempting to sell me objects whose categories are indiscernible they cannot be derived
i have photographs of objects like this screenshots that i've taken but here's what i want to get at
if another country wanted to destroy the united states um they wouldn't have to do it by attacking us
also we are economic partners so they have to make sure that like we have to buy their products and
they have to buy products from us and so forth we're sort of economically linked so what they might do
instead is just undermine our capacity to understand phenomena at all right to make sense of the world
and one and since what what americans do a lot is shop one of the best ways to do that would be to
give us an experience of shopping that is so incoherent and um insurmountably endlessly diverse
that
the foundations of our capacity to derive identity will warp and once that happens
all kinds of things happen in a sequence
a cascade of cognitive disasters ensues where we can't make sense of anything
and this is why i've said 20 recently in another video 2024 is not a year because the foundations of
the faculties that we use to derive and understand identity and continuity in identity and meaning
and sequences of events and time all of these things have been intentionally
ambiguated in and weaponized on purpose as a military endeavor by the structures presently
in game theoretical combat on the world stage
and to say we're in trouble is the grossest kind of understatement
um it's as if the apocalypse already happened and we're a dead species walking and we just can't figure
it out that doesn't mean there's no hope or that there's nothing we can do
um there's all kinds of amazing things you can do even in an absolute disaster as human beings
and as beings and as minds and part of what we can do is to understand the situation that we're in
and how and gain insight into it together but i mean if you go to amazon you try to buy a pair of socks
socks or a light bulb or a fork or a pot or a pan or anything what you're going to see
in most cases is a barrage of chinese products
um please don't try to accuse me of racism this has nothing to do with a preference for some ethnicity
or anything like that what i'm trying to say is that the chinese as a military power
have figured out that the primary activity that powerful americans engage in is shopping
and so what they've done is they've created a barrage of incoherent shopping experiences
that foundationally
cause us to begin hallucinating in our categorical expectations
of meaningful
of meaningful identity of objects
it is impossible to find a simple solution to a shopping problem on amazon in 2024
temu
isn't a shopping platform it's a weapon
it's a weapon look at it try to understand this is a military device
and what it attacks is the possibility of a coherent commercial transaction
where you desire a product you go to buy it the process succeeds you're charged you get a receipt you
go home that process has been drawn into a psyop like phantasmagoria
of both the impossibility of fulfillment and the promise
of
of what transcendental
meta fulfillment
the promise of transcendental metal fulfillment
coupled with the impossibility of simple fulfillment
is the recipe to rip the american mind to shred
to just destroy this nation and it will
that one thing that is a masterwork
of asymmetric military advantage
it takes the principle
of the uap
and applies it militarily
to consumerism
it will devastate america that one thing that one weapon
makes nukes unnecessary your air force won't help you your navy
trivial you got soldiers we don't care
we have markets we have tamu
we will become you
you will become us
i mean this is so psychologically dangerous
anything that attacks the capacity of a given people's ability
to determine whether there's a difference between something
to detect drift in a situation
if you can attack that thing
the capacity to detect drift
you can own that population militarily
you can own them ideologically
you don't have to win
see you don't have to get them waving chinese flags
you have to get them so confused that they can't wave an american flag
they can't wave any flag
and it's not that flag waving is the goal
what i'm trying to say is
humans have social ideological and intellectual
coherence with cohorts
and if you obliterate that
you can steal anything from them
their history their future
their ideology
you can just inject nonsense
into all the places that were previously structured
relatively coherently
even if they were structured by lethal fictions
you can replace those lethal fictions with delusions
and then you can just
anything you want is yours
they will no longer represent a threat to you or your agenda
they won't be able to form up any kind of resistance or concern
the incoherence in their social systems
will destroy them
so this is the weaponization of the possibility of that which
is to the waking mind
what the intrusion of the momenta
that presage the collapse of the dreaming manifold are to the dreaming mind
this is a dire situation
it's one form of a process i call frame collapse
we're going to talk more about that process in future
explorations
i don't want to leave you with the grim
the grim footprint
of a terrifying future but the humans are in a series of multi-polar traps
we're going to have to invent ways of being human together
that are so amazing liberating insightful inspiring and joyful to participate in
but nothing can outcompete them
that is well within our capacity
the challenges that we're facing will catalyze this
and given any kind of support whatsoever
i will spend my energy to ensure a future that looks like that
together with those of like mind and heart and intention
so it's not all grim apocalypse but
wow are we on 60 different cliffs at the same time
i love this world i love the humans
i know something of our origins and natures
their transcendental character
and they are beautiful and profound
they will not fall gently before
an assault
like those
our dissociated
societies are forging they will not fall before that but
i'm afraid a bit of a storm is coming your hearts
so for now
take a moment to comment share
if you have a little bit of money and you want to support my work
anything matters a dollar a month would be great
i have a patreon you can send me a one-time donation if you want
feel free to get in touch directly if you have questions or concerns or
leave questions in the channel
and i'll respond to them or just
tell me what you think you know
did you get something valuable here because i'm trying to give you gifts
and keys that will get us all out of cages
so if you have an idea about how i might do that more effectively or more beautifully
i'd love to hear from you
remember your origins remember your childhood remember the beauty of your
originary
imperatives
your dreaming
your altruistic heart
your heroic beauty
may your life and relationships be beautiful and healing adventurous and ecstatic
so grateful to have this time together
thank you for joining me
i look forward to learning together again
very soon
bye bye for now
