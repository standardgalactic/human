Hello, everybody. Welcome. I'm especially excited to welcome new listeners. I have a very tiny committed audience and a very tiny audience in general on YouTube, primarily because I won't allow advertising on my recordings, which also means that I make zero money.
But market share does matter. So Amon Hillman, my videos on Amon Hillman have increased my audience share somewhat. A fact for which I'm thankful to Hillman himself. He's a brilliant and iconoclastic being.
But I don't make videos about Amon in an attempt to hitchhike on his recent fame. I make videos about him because I've learned some astonishing things from listening to him.
And as those of you who follow my work know, I'm very interested in features of human cognition that allow us to see better.
And by see, I mean comprehend, understand, perspectivally relate with ideas. Ideas about the nature of existence, about what is or is not the case, about the origins of our situations, problems, concerns, questions, and inspirations as human beings.
And as beings, and as organisms, and as animals. For we are not merely human. Most of us is not human.
The relationship we have with being, not human. The relationship we have as terrestrial organisms, not human.
We are space life, just like aliens on another planet would be space life. We come from space.
The earth just happens to be the location on which we condense, right?
On which the derivation from space-time to material existence occurs.
As animals, we are not human.
The tiniest part of us is human.
And we make the mistake of displacing that onto the entire question.
Which, you know, would be like trying to use the tip of your pinky to...
I don't even know what.
Yeah, it would be like trying to use the tip of your pinky for something you need both hands to do.
Right?
And that's what we're doing with our thought.
We're acting in an incredibly childish and immature way.
And then we get very demanding.
And very insistent on the primacy and supremacy of the results we derive.
Using processes that I wouldn't trust to manipulate silverware, let alone cognition.
That's what it's like to be human in our time.
We're taking the eyelash of our mind and pretending that's the entire body.
And then getting really insistent and militaristically hubristic about those results.
You see this all over the internet.
I know what's going on. It's this.
Oh, yeah? Really?
Okay, well, what's going on?
First of all, it isn't a matter of what is the case.
Because human minds introduce 90 billion dimensions to what is the case that aren't factual.
So, unless you can account for all that stuff that has nothing to do with what is true or not,
you're not even starting to think yet.
I have so much, so much I'm excited to talk about with you today.
And I'm very grateful to all my new listeners.
Please take a moment to comment, ask a question, subscribe, share.
Any way that you support my work is very helpful because it's really difficult to get new audience share unless I advertise.
And that would be the most ironic thing in human history.
I mean, the abject hypocrisy of me allowing advertisements on my channel would be...
I couldn't live it down.
I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.
I might get a little bit of money, but I would hate myself.
So, yeah, not going to happen ever.
I will never allow advertisements on this channel.
I mean, to whatever degree I'm capable of prohibiting them anyway.
For the moment, I can prohibit them.
I think.
I mean, if you're seeing advertisements, let me know because you shouldn't be.
And, you know, if you really want to support me, you can make a donation via PayPal to sansis at pacbell.net or by my Patreon page, which you can find on my, you know, on my profile page, right?
Which has my links to my website, my Facebook, my blogger, Wondercloud, and my Patreon.
So, yeah, thank you for being here.
Appreciate you.
Without you, there's no reason to do this.
And we learn together.
I'm learning when I'm making these.
I'm not just reading from the book of Darren's thoughts.
I'm discovering things.
You know, in my talk about the difference between facts and understanding,
there's a quote here that I wrote some time ago that I think is important.
Much of my capacity to see and learn depends upon a deep intimacy with metaphor.
This is ironic because it means that my capacity to understand the, quote, literal, unquote, world actually depends on my facility with translating it into various profound and illustrative fictions
whose structural resonances, whose structural resonances with the topic reveal to my insight, what ordinary literality could never aspire to even refer to, let alone illustrate.
Think about that.
What I'm saying is, without illustrative, imaginal fictions that have to do with presenting one thing as if it were something it is not.
In other words, analogy and metaphor, I wouldn't be able to understand anything.
It turns out that understanding is based on the capacity to compare two things and notice both their similarities and their differences.
This is the power of analogy and metaphor.
This is the basis of human cognition.
If you can't metaphorize something, knowledge about what the atom does doesn't help you.
You won't be able to understand it.
You can do the math, but you won't have the understanding, which is our primary situation in quantum physics.
Or what we call quantum mechanics, anyway.
Okay, we're going to go to the sky here today, so strap in, folks.
We're going to see some pretty unusual features of our human cognition.
I hope, I think.
So, we are trained to think as if the literal is the true and the non-literal is the false.
Which is really a dumb idea, because as human beings, unless we're extremely unusual, and some of us are.
I have many profoundly unusually minded friends who are vastly more intelligent than the average bear.
Well, I don't know about that.
I don't know too much about bears' minds.
The ways we are trained to think about nature, identity, facts, and so on, are insane because, as I mentioned earlier, facts, the accessible facts, facts accessible to human thought, must be less than 1% of what's going on.
So, if that's what you trust, you're trapped there, and you can go no further, and you'll feel very certain about things that actually have infinite qualities, and relationships, and features, and so on.
What are you going to do when you cross the border?
I don't really know.
That's what you, she's saying the same thing that I'm saying, but about a different, a different situation.
In any case, we moderns are missing intelligent stories about our history.
And I'm, I'm going to not merely suggest, but essentially say, right, that for most of human history, our minds were directly connected with each other and other minds.
We weren't merely telepathic, we were meta-telepathic.
Telepathy is the idea that you can determine the content of another mind, or communicate the content of yours to another mind, without a visible means of transport.
In other words, without speech, without writing, without sign language.
And it's more than merely intuition, but there's something far beyond telepathy, which is the capacity to directly share experience, thought, insight, memory, right, directly, so that you have, for example, you experience the same thing I experience as I am chewing some delicious food.
Or as I am singing a song, or as I am singing a song, or as I am composing music, you have the same experience I have.
And we, our people, used to share this, these faculties, not merely with humans, but with all the other kinds of organisms on earth, and with a broad array of non-human intelligences that,
some of which we might describe as divine, but however we describe them, they are highly complex disembodied intelligences that can participate in the network of minds across time.
I suspect that our species was symbiotic with these intelligences for most of our history, until there was a catastrophe which deprived us, suddenly and inexplicably, of most of these abilities.
And so we went from being, from having a meaningful role in a complex universe of beings, to having nothing but the possibility of, quote, rational thought, and technological, and military, and commercial development, which are immiserating.
They are a cruel substitute for intimacies.
There were disasters that occurred that severed the many umbilici that connected us to the rest of the relational, transcendent, and intelligent universe.
And then, we thought, we came to think, as these memories faded over the generations, we came to think that we were alone, which cannot be true, demonstrably untrue, in nature.
Even if there's nothing in space, even if space is absolutely empty, we were never alone.
There are forms of intelligence here on earth that are so profound, that they make science fiction look trivial.
The entire range of science fiction look trivial in comparison to what's going on right here.
And that's demonstrable.
That's not a suggestion.
It's not me being imaginative.
So, these umbilical disasters, which I'm writing an essay about now, left us bereft, not merely of our natural, symbiotic, cognitive, and emotional, and transcendental relationships.
They left us bereft of purpose.
We can no longer tell what we are, how we got here, where we come from, why we're here, why are we even incarnating.
There used to be a profound library of reasons.
Exquisite, ecstatic reasons.
To take on a physical body.
All of that disappeared and just became, it was replaced with nonsense, card catalogs of bullshit, crazy narratives that have nothing to do with what we are, where we come from, who we can become.
Our actual potentials are so staggeringly astonishing that were you to be exposed to the tiniest fragment of them, you would lose consciousness.
You wouldn't be able to stand up, right?
Your mind would short-circuit because it would so violate everything you've come to think and believe about your humanity that all, your entire categorical lexicon would be, would be, well, it would explode.
It would be shredded.
What you think a tree is, what you think the sun is, all of these things would be completely obliterated and replaced with multidimensional, impossibly beautiful, direct understanding due to direct participation in them.
Not thinking, right?
Thinking is something you do when you can't, there's no intimacy.
Thinking is the result of the end of symbiotic intimacy, relational intimacy.
That's when you start thinking.
You're going to do banking or make war or you have a plan.
That's thinking.
So most of what we think about and how we think is so broken that if we were to simply be relieved of it for a moment, we would be ecstatic.
This is partly why people become very interested in...
Hey, you know what 9th Street is?
Oh, I do.
Which way?
It's that way.
You go to the end of this lake, 9th Avenue or 9th Street?
We came in through 9th Street.
Yeah, 9th Avenue?
Yeah.
Yeah, 9th Avenue, if you go to the end of the lake and there's a little stairway there, go down that stairway, follow the street around, continue in that direction, and you'll come to, you'll hit 9th Avenue.
9th Avenue is the street that comes into Golden Gate Park and then passes the Botanical Gardens.
Right.
That's why I want to go to the Botanical Gardens.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Just go back that way.
Go down those stairs and then make a right and the Botanical Gardens will be right in front of you.
Oh, thank you.
My pleasure.
Now, where was I?
Navigation.
All right, let me think about this for a moment.
So, yeah, the ironic thing is that the complex nonsensical narratives we have built are meant to protect us from the possibility of actual contact with our true nature.
In the same way, an animal that is extremely light and can be blown up into the sky by a breeze hides behind a tree, here's analogy and metaphor again, we are hiding, our species is hiding from our transcendental origins, natures, and abilities.
Because under the right conditions, you have abilities that would make Superman look boring.
Your mind was born for things that the entirety of science fiction hasn't even speculatively suggested.
And everyone's going to say, okay, Darren, show us.
Well, let's put together a context under which these faculties can be retrieved and activated, and I'll be happy to show you.
So, if that's what you want, we can do it.
Well, let me be really clear.
The things I'm talking about, I didn't make them up.
I'm incapable of making up what I'm talking about.
They were shown to me during contact events with a non-human intelligence.
And in fact, saying a non-human intelligence is kind of confusing because there's a whole similar, there's a university beyond the surface of the earth
In the foundations that produce what we call time-space, there are myriad beings involved in that project
that have been involved in it from the get-go, if there was such a thing as a get-go.
No idea what the hell a get-go is.
But I guess that's the evolutionary precursor to a ghetto, or a gecko.
Right? If a ghetto and a gecko mate, you get a get-go.
Ha ha.
So, we benighted moderns, if we are to rediscover our actual natures and origins and potentials,
we must learn to look beyond the bizarre narratives that are in place and are very dominant
that both gatekeep in human cognition.
They keep the gates, none shall pass, the riddle of the sphinx, and so forth.
And protect us from the dangerous possibility of stumbling into the whole situation suddenly.
There are many humans who have done, they have done this, they've had this experience.
But in any case, there's a few things that I actually want to chase today.
So, let's see if we can wander from where I am into that direction.
They have to do with topics I have broached in recent videos, but also in old ones.
And if you want to get a taste of an enthusiastic Darren, go look at some of my old videos
that have the object that looks a bit like a satellite on them, and strange names.
You'll find some trippy stuff back there.
That was back when I was still on fire.
In any case, I'm going to talk about the human experience of identity.
And the first thing that I want you to understand is that, unfortunately, you and I,
we're in a situation where we're like a very young, possibly intelligent creature
that has only ever seen three objects in its life.
It has lived in a little box, cognitively, a very small box.
And the only things in that box are one plant, one animal, and one rock.
Now, there's also a fork.
So we've got an animal, a vegetable, a mineral, and a synthetic object, an artificial object.
And because we have only these four categories, I mean, we have a couple of other categories.
We have things like, oh, it's a process, right?
Oh, it's a situation.
These are better.
Oh, it's a circumstance.
That one's really good because it means one's stance in a circle or sphere.
And what I'm trying to get us to do is to orbit in cognition concepts
and particularly how we relate with the feature of cognition that derives identities
because that's the root where either the trap or the liberation ensues.
So we're like a creature that's seen four things.
Now, let's be really clear.
I mean, one analogy would be a child.
The reason I'm not using that analogy, like a small child,
who's only seen, we think, they've only seen a few objects.
And we don't think they know, we don't think they bring with them a lexicon, generally.
I think they do bring something really transcendental with them.
And we'll get to that because we humans are the incomplete animal.
If you are not born into a human culture like those we are familiar with,
you won't be a human being.
You won't become a human being.
You won't get a mind like we have.
You won't become representationally cognitive like we are.
You won't have language.
And neither will you be an animal, right?
So you won't be a human and you won't be an animal.
You'll take on traits of the animals that raise you.
You know, like the girl, the children who were, quote, raised by dogs, unquote,
in the wilderness or whatever.
We've seen a few children who grew up wild.
It turns out that for humans there's a special phase or a series of phases
wherein you're so pliable and ready for what I'll call uptake
of representational cognition or other things
that we don't think much about and we should
because the uptake potentials of the human child and the adult
are astonishingly rich.
The child much more so,
but even the possibilities for an adult
are a thousandfold beyond what we imagine
usually, what we usually imagine,
what we're trained to imagine.
So we are the incomplete animal
and we are completed
by processes
that I call,
well, it's unfortunate that we are completed by these processes,
but we are completed by the processes
of enculturation
and in languaging
that continue throughout our lifetimes
that have their primary inceptions in our childhood.
And these establish
the foundations of representational cognition
and of thought.
And most of what we are,
the uptake that we undergo in childhood
is viciously
impoverished.
I mean, just catastrophically impoverished
and impoverishing.
We get a shitty lexicon
for the categories of identity,
the categories of function,
the categories of meaning.
The origin category is almost obliterated.
Essentially, most of what we inherit
are handicaps.
They look,
I mean, there's a little bit of uplift in them,
a tiny bit,
but most of us aren't going to achieve
escape velocity
from that stuff.
In other words, what we should get
is stuff that lifts us
far, far above
previous generations
and even our ancestors
and fulfills
some of the origin purposes
and dreaming
not just of our ancestors,
but of the sky, right?
The universe
is dreaming
as us.
We don't get that,
but my point is that
the humans are an incomplete creature.
We're literally born
for a broad array of relationships
we don't even believe exist.
The closest things we have to them
are things like
stories about gods
and angels
and UFOs
and things.
That's what, you know,
we have stories
about stuff
we can't remember
that,
it would be like
having a story,
it'd be like having a hand
that you've never seen
and can't use,
but you have a story
about it
and the story's really weird
because it's actually
your own hand
and the problem with us
is the reverse of this, right?
We are the hand
of time-space,
of non-human intelligences,
of all,
of the entire
biorelational hyperstructure
of our world,
its history
and its future.
We are the hand of that
and we're walking around
and we're like,
no, no,
I'm a human being,
give me a gun.
Can I have a factory?
Oh, yeah,
let's go to Safeway.
Oh, yeah,
I love it.
This is what,
it's insane.
If you could imagine
a bird that was born
to fly
in a thousand dimensions
of relation
and gets chained
to a chalkboard
with some figures on it,
that's us.
And it's not just
catastrophic for us,
it's catastrophic
for the beings
who are our natural
symbionts
because in the same way
we are deprived of them,
they have been deprived
of us
and both sides
went insane.
when this happens,
both sides go nuts.
The angels cried
when the humans
disappeared
from their relational family
in this version,
in this theoria
because we were meant
to be completed
not by humans,
by a broad array
of non-human intelligences
and the humans
who were our ancestors
and parents
and so on.
So we're like a kid
who's seen
four categories
of objects
in a universe
in which the concept
of category
is actually transdimensional
so that there are
billions of modes
of categories
and we have three
or four
and we think,
oh, we know
what's going on.
Let's build
some more machines
and, you know,
yeah, some atomic weapons
and bioweapons
and let's do cyber warfare.
Let's do psyops
on our, right?
The humans are just,
they're going nuts.
It's as if the species
is trying to commit suicide
because it can't exist
in the vacuum
that arose
during the cascade
of umbilical disasters
that represent
the origins
of the evolution
of human consciousness
and this is the stuff
that Julian Jaynes
didn't quite understand.
He couldn't think
this radically
when he was writing
The Origins of Consciousness
in the Breakdown
of the Bicameral Mind,
a brilliant book,
one of the most amazing books
I've ever encountered
with, you know,
some mistakes in it.
Um, you don't have
to get everything right
to be brilliant.
Let's be clear about that.
And in fact,
getting everything right,
if you succeed at that,
you're an idiot
because you've,
the only way to succeed
at getting everything right
is to reduce the scope
so radically
that rightness
doesn't matter anymore.
Um, yeah.
All right.
So, the incomplete animal.
The result of a cast,
a long evolutionary cascade
of crippling
umbilical devastations
where we are disconnected
from our origins.
We are disconnected
from the sky.
We are disconnected
from the living places.
We are disconnected
from the plants,
disconnected from the animals,
disconnected
from the atmosphere,
from the water,
from the earth,
from the electricity.
We are disconnected
from each other.
And then,
in the,
in the aftermath
of these catastrophes,
we build representations
of the lost connections.
And we call these movies,
video games,
and the internet,
and social media.
And we are fracked
and mined
and psychographized
for military,
commercial,
psychological,
political,
and ideological
purposes.
We are bait
for danger.
We are danger bait
our whole lives.
Most of us
will live and die
and never
get outside
the crippling prison
of human knowledge,
which has about
as much to do
with what's going on
as 7-Eleven
has to do
with organic food.
I'm up on top
of Strawberry Hill
and the view
is quite profound.
But half the view
is the structure
of the city
from above,
which just looks like
a complex,
structural cancer-generating factory.
Right?
The guy's
wearing a T-shirt
with a cross-section
of a tree
where you can see
all the rings.
And the first thing
I thought
when I saw that
is,
oh,
that's a dead tree.
That's a tree
the humans killed.
There's no such thing.
One thing you never had
in nature,
probably ever,
until the humans
built ridiculous machines
for tree killing,
you never saw
a cross-section
of a tree.
To see a cross-section
of a tree,
you either have
to be transcendent
so that you can
just indwell
into the tree,
which is one
of our abilities
as humans.
Or you have to
have a chainsaw.
Right?
And you cut
through the tree
and you kill it
and then you see
the cross-section
and you're like,
oh,
wow,
this tree was
3,000 years old.
So glad I destroyed it.
So glad I obliterated
its entire lineage
and future.
Oh,
yeah,
so powerful
of us humans.
Wow.
Wow,
yeah,
cut that tree
down
and then look
at the cross-section
in awe
at how many rings
are in there.
Brilliant.
If only the humans
understood
that when you kill
a tree,
you're killing yourself,
chopping down
your own
relational integrity,
your potential
for intelligence
and the future,
the dreams
of your ancestors.
When you cut
that tree down,
you're making
a terrifying
array of mistakes
in almost every case
because everything
that lives here
is one being.
It's also one family.
It's one history.
It's one spaceship.
It's one vehicle.
It's more than
merely alive.
It's transcendent.
The substrate
of reality
around the earth
is unique
and different
from above
the earth.
There's a
transcendent
manifold
here
that is established
by the organisms
that makes it
possible to have
coherent minds
near here.
Humans say,
oh yeah,
we possess minds.
We're going to get
in spaceships
and go fly around.
You're out of
your fucking mind.
You possess a mind
because you're local
to the earth,
most likely.
In any case,
that's a bit
of Darrenism,
so we'll get back
to the topic here.
So you've got
this species
that has been
deprived of all
of its historical
memories.
And it's aching
for anamnesis
and trying to build
God inside a machine
called an AI,
which is hilarious
because it's not
even clear that the
humans are intelligent
at all.
We should define
intelligence to be
an extremely
rarefied quality,
not simply the
capacity to make
machines.
That's not intelligent.
Nor simply the
capacity to do math
or have science.
That's not intelligent.
That's repcog.
That's representational
cognition.
But intelligence
is different stuff.
Intelligence is
awareness and
understanding,
knowing what not
to build,
the foresight
of the problems
that will ensue
if you make
things,
or if you
build multipolar
traps for life
on Earth,
your species,
or you engage
in game theoretical
races to the bottom,
driven by
perverse incentives
in the language
of Daniel Schmachtenberger
and others.
That's not
intelligent.
Sorry.
It's
sophisticated.
Sophisticated,
yes.
Intelligent,
no.
If your moves
get you killed,
you weren't smart.
Let's just be
really clear.
You're not
sapien sapiens
if your moves
get you and
the future and
history of life
on Earth dead.
That's not
intelligence.
Let's be really,
really clear about
that.
We need to define
intelligence very
carefully.
We should
probably define
it as something
that is
impossible for
machines by
themselves.
Verging on a
complex array
of topics here,
so I'm going to
steer back
toward a couple
of concerns
that I started
out with.
I was talking
with a close
family member
yesterday,
and
I recently
got a new
piece of
technology
and became
very concerned
when I
discovered that
one of the
features of
this tech
was that
noise cancellation
in previous
models of the
tech was
gone.
And I used
a new mic,
a new,
what would
you call
it?
Yeah,
I was using
a wired
headset.
I use a
wired headset
to make my
recordings,
and I walk
around while
I'm doing
them,
so it gives
me,
I still get
some exercise,
and I have
some intellectual
exploration and
fun and discovery
and stuff,
and hopefully we
all benefit,
because we get
to think about
things that are
really difficult
to even imagine
normally.
Anyway,
got the new
tech,
had a big
drama,
because I
walked around
and made,
I made a
recording that
I really
liked,
and I used
my strange,
you know,
wrap a cotton
ball around
the inline mic
with a little
bread wire
thing to
handle wind
noise and
background noise,
and it works
really well on
the mic I'm
using right now.
It's not
perfect,
but it's
quite a good
solution.
So I walked
around,
made a video
like that,
and got home
and it was
pure noise
with a new
device,
and I looked
and the
noise
cancellation
feature that
a friend
had asked
me about
because I
couldn't hear
the crickets
behind him
except when
he was
talking.
When he
would talk,
I could hear
them.
When he
stopped
talking,
I couldn't.
So he
wanted to
know how
to turn
off the
noise
cancellation,
and I
showed him.
If only
we could
cancel the
cognitive,
intellectual,
and
relational
noise,
the
commercial
noise,
the
industrial
noise of
pollution,
the
electro
noise,
the
non-native
EMF,
as my
friend
Mr. N
called it
so
insightfully.
In any
case,
my friend
wanted to
turn off
the noise
cancellation,
so I
figured out
that there
was a
setting
that allows
you to
do this
in the
older devices.
And then
I got a
new device
recently,
I made a
recording,
it was full
of noise,
I thought,
oh no,
maybe the
noise cancellation
is off.
So I went
and looked
for the
noise
cancellation
setting,
and it
didn't
exist.
Turned out
they had
removed it
from the
later
devices.
This
caused an
uproar
among
users of
these
devices.
There
were
Reddit
posts,
and Quora
posts,
and all
kinds of
people
freaking
out,
crying,
that's
my
noise
cancellation,
why would
they take
this away?
I was
freaking
out.
I thought,
oh shit,
I'm going
to have to
return my
device and
get an
older one
in order
to have
noise
cancellations
so I
can make
my
walk and
talk
recordings.
Let me
just cut
to the
chase
here.
Turns
out that
the mic
on the
lightning
connector
inline
headset
is
way
more
sensitive
than the
mics on
the 3.5
millimeter
plug
inline
headsets
or inline
mic
headsets.
So
what the
noise
cancellation
setting
actually did
had nothing
to do with
my microphone.
the problem
was in the
microphone,
not in
the device.
And what
the old
setting used
to do
was use
microphones
to detect
noise around
the person
listening and
speaking
when they're
holding their
phone to
their ear
and make
adjustments
so that
what?
Background
noise?
Wait.
So that
you could
hear the
person on
the other
end of
the line
better.
Right?
In other
words,
what it
canceled
wasn't
mic
noise,
noise in
the mic.
It
canceled
noise around
you
while you're
listening to
someone
on the
phone's
speaker.
That's what
it was for.
Nothing to
do with
what I
thought.
So it
turned out
that I
was fine
and I
had
overthunk
it,
which does
happen
occasionally.
But I
also realized
in process
that I was
probably
overthinking
it.
And by
the way,
you can
see here
the key
to this
weird
zeroth
world
problem I
was having.
What is
the key?
The key is
what is the
meaning of
noise cancellation?
What does
it mean
when it's
there?
What does
it mean
when it's
gone?
And what
does that
lead to?
Well,
that leads
to identity
because it
makes us
have to
ask what
is noise
cancellation?
And I
had the
wrong idea.
I thought
noise
cancellation
is a
series of
algorithms
that reduce
the noise
at the
mic in
the process
of recording
or transmitting
my voice.
The noise
is reduced.
Wrong!
I mean,
there is
noise reduction
for that,
but it's
not a
setting.
that you
can change.
You can't
turn it on
and off.
You never
could,
even on this
device that I
use.
So, yes,
very interesting.
Right now I can
hear the rumbling
of the wind in my
ears,
and I'm hoping
that my cotton ball
on my inline mic
is mostly protecting
you from hearing
that sound on the
other end.
So, I was
talking with a
close family
member,
and I know
I'm bird
walking,
but that's
part of how
we get to
amazing places
if we do
it well.
If we
complete the
arcs that
we start,
they tend,
and it's done
skillfully,
they will weave
together to
give us a
to give us
an around
the sphere
view of a
topic.
Wow!
Little vole just
ran out,
took a look at
me,
freaked out,
ran back.
Ran out of the
bush.
Oh my god,
there's a god
there.
I better run
away.
Boom,
ran away.
You know,
on earth,
there are gods
on earth.
They call them
humans.
To the rest of
nature,
we are bad
gods.
Let's be clear.
We're not
nature,
right?
We're not
regular animals.
We do all
kinds of
things that
regular animals
don't do,
like drive
cars.
Or run
over animals,
right?
Nothing runs
over other
animals.
It doesn't
do that.
If something's
bearing down
on you,
and it's not
intending to
kill you,
and you
stop,
it'll go
around you,
unless it's
a car,
right?
That'll just
kill you,
and your
children,
and maybe,
you know,
everything.
So yeah,
we're not,
the humans
don't,
we don't
believe in
gods and
angels,
and yet on
earth,
we are
gods and
angels.
Think about
that carefully
for a moment.
We are
demons.
We have
the capacity
to reach
down into
the other
orders of
life and
transform the
situation
dramatically,
instantaneously,
just as if we
were wizards,
or sorcerers,
or gods.
There's no
other creature
that can help
a bird repair
a broken wing
and get back
to the sky.
We can.
And we can
also,
there's no
other creature
that can shoot
down a bird,
or a whole
flock of birds,
or poison
an entire
environment,
right?
Or,
restore an
entire environment
to thriving
ecological
efflorescence.
We do.
We are
gods.
This,
but see,
the hubris
part of that,
we're not,
we're not gods
in the sense
that we're the
most important
thing going
on.
We're gods
in the sense
that we
inhabit a
broad array
of unique
dimensions that
other regular
organisms don't
inhabit.
Now,
similarly,
so do
they.
So,
we could
symbiose
with them
relationally
and cognitively
as our
ancestors
certainly did
and share
resources across
the bridge
of the
between of
us,
the liminality
of our
being,
together here
on one
world,
one little
droplet
in time
space.
I mean,
it's an
infinite droplet
until the
humans pull
the apocalypse
trigger,
but,
yeah,
so we are
gods.
In any case,
let's go back
to this
noise
cancellation
thing.
So,
I had a
freak out.
I thought,
oh god,
I'm going to
have to send
my phone
back,
get an older
one that has
the noise
cancellation
so I can
make my
walk and
talks.
Turns out,
not true.
Bought an
adapter,
connected my
3.5 headset
to the
lightning port,
made some
tests,
and the
recent recordings
have been
done on my
new device,
and they're
just as not
noisy as my
old ones were,
and they're
probably a little
bit clearer.
Someday I'll
get really good
tech,
maybe,
if I'm
lucky,
hopefully before
I pass the
veil.
In any case,
I'm talking
with a family
member yesterday,
and hilariously,
my family member
also had a
noise cancellation
experience during
the same span of
time where we
weren't talking,
and his noise
cancellation experience
was really
hilariously
amazing.
I think there's
a little sliver
in my sock,
so I'm going
to sit down
and try to
pull this out.
I know that
seems like I
probably shouldn't
tell you,
and I could just
go on the
story,
but nope.
So I'm
talking with
my family
member,
and he says,
so I got
some new
ear pods.
Now,
of course,
I'm an old
school guy.
I'm an OG
tech.
I've been
working with
computers basically
since they were
invented.
Pretty close.
Well,
since they
became available
to the public,
well,
let's just put a
year on it,
80,
80?
Yeah,
81,
something like
that.
I've been
working with
computers since
then.
So I've
watched the
whole,
you know,
long developmental
arc of the
technologies that
surround computing,
including the
internet,
email,
text messaging,
video games,
phones,
surveillance tech,
all this stuff.
Yeah,
alarms,
security devices,
all these things.
So,
my family member
said,
I got some,
I got these
new
ear pods,
and
they're noise
canceling.
and he
said,
I've got to
explain to you
what the
experience of
using them
was like,
and what
happened to
me when I
started using
them.
So I
listened,
and he
said,
there's no way
for me to
possibly explain
to you what
happened.
like,
I put the
right pod
in my
ear,
and when,
a few moments
later,
I put the
left pod
in,
everything
went silent.
Now,
this,
this is like
a,
this is like
a Stephen
Wright joke.
Got these
noise-canceling
heads,
ear pods,
I put them
in,
all the
fucking
noise of
my entire
history
went away.
I forgot
what noise
was.
I couldn't
even remember
having heard
things,
ever.
This is,
this is what,
and so,
my family
member said,
I've never
had an
experience of
quiet in my
life.
I can't even
remember
experiencing
silence,
but for the
first time
when I put
those in,
it was
quiet.
and I
thought to
myself,
you know,
I think
maybe I'd
prefer to
be deaf.
Now,
this is a
very interesting
little branch,
which I'm not
going to
explore deeply,
but I will
say that
there are
clades of
deaf people
who don't
want their
children to
have the
sense of
hearing,
and before
you leap
to conclusions
in your
self-righteous
consciousness
about how
they don't
get to make
that choice
for their
kids and
blah-ba-dee
blah-ba-dee
blah.
You've got
to think
about how
much noise
we are
subject to
as human
beings in
the modern
world,
because there
is just
noise
everywhere.
I mean,
90% of
the sounds
that come
in our
ears are
painful
garbage
from
machines.
Yeah,
right?
It's not
natural
sound.
So think
about what's
the,
show me
the pie
chart or
the sphere
of sounds
that reach
our ears
and what
percentage
of those
are natural
sounds.
And then
actually
articulate the
pie chart so
that it
shows not
just which
sounds are
natural and
unnatural,
but the
loudness of
the sounds.
And what
you will find
is that you
might actually
be better off
without hearing
as a modern.
it wouldn't
be surprising
if
advantageous
mutations
do
survive
in cohorts
that we
could evolve
such that
the eardrum
just goes
away,
right?
In the same
way that when
you kill up
a bunch of
rattlesnakes
over a short
period of time
or a short
period of
evolutionary
time,
they lose
the rattles,
right?
You no longer
get a warning.
They don't need
that thing
anymore because
it doesn't
help them,
right?
They're just
going to be
killed either
way.
Or the rattle
leads to them
getting killed,
so let's just
get rid of that.
Now the humans
don't get a warning,
you just get bit
and, you know,
get really sick
and or die.
So my family
member was
marveling at
what it was like
to hear silence
for the first
time.
Not the first
time.
He's been to
places, you
know, in Joshua
Tree or maybe
up in some
mountain or
somewhere,
where there
was quiet.
We've all,
you know, we
do have some
experience of
silence, though
many of us
now, for a
broad variety
of reasons,
experience
tinnitus, which
is the
constant
sounding of
the ears.
As if the
ears are just
feeding back,
right, from
constant
overstimulation.
So he said,
yeah, I
thought, maybe I
don't really need
to hear
anymore.
Now, this
family member
is monastically
inclined, so, and
he's also got a
very, what's the
right word,
sardonic sense of
humor.
So then, he
said, over
time, I
couldn't tell if
they weren't, I
couldn't tell that
they weren't
working right,
right, which I
think is
hilarious, I
can't tell that
they're not, not
working, right.
You know what I
don't quite mean?
I couldn't tell
they're not, not
working.
And, and, and
then he said, so,
I can't tell if
maybe they're
just, they're just
not as good over
time, or if my
interaction with
them causes my
ears to adjust, so
that I, I
naturally hear more
noise, or I just
don't know.
So I can't tell if
they're broken, or
if something's wrong
with them, or if
my ears are
adjusting to the
silence to be able
to hear more
things in the
silence.
And I'm like,
yep, this is
entirely indicative
of human cognition
circa 2024.
We can't tell what
the things aren't
being, or what
they're not doing,
and where they
aren't.
We don't know
what they are, we
can't tell what
they're not.
The whole problem
with identity has
become catastrophically
magnified, self
magnifying, in a
spiral, a
geometric spiral.
So, I thought that
was hilarious, and
brilliant, because we
had both had an
inner product drama
with noise
cancellation.
Similarly, this
family member
suggested that
there's a huge
problem with
shopping.
They went to a
store, him and
another of his
monastic friends
went to a store
to get some
shampoo, which I
also thought was
hilarious, because
Stephen Wright, again,
he was like, why
do we have
shampoo?
Can't we just use
real poo?
Do we have to have
a sham all the
time?
Hilarious, right?
Anyway, they went
to get some, you
know, personal
hygiene products, and
it was terrifyingly
bizarre and
futuristic.
Because it was in
Los Angeles, all the
products were locked
up.
In order to buy
basic things, like,
you know, soap or
a toothbrush or
something, you had
to push a button,
which would then
embarrass you
catastrophically by
announcing broadband,
people on aisle six
need help with a
shampoo, and then
no one would come.
Everyone would look
at you, you know,
you push the button,
you're embarrassed.
It's like you have
that feeling like you
have in those dreams
where you find
yourself at school
and you get up in
front of the class
and you realize,
oh, oh, God, I
didn't put my pants
on this morning.
Oh, Jesus.
So, yeah.
That's the kind of
feeling he was
describing, and it
was so bizarre, they
were just trying to
simply go to a
large store and buy
a couple of personal
hygiene products.
Couldn't make that
happen.
No one came.
When they pushed
the button, there
was the vast, you
know, the world
shattering announcement.
By the way, the
noise and the
loudness.
See this problem?
This guy right here
is trying to get
some shampoo.
Send someone to
help him.
Right?
Nobody came.
They had to push
the button three
times.
Everybody in the
universe knew they
were trying to buy
shampoo.
It was embarrassing.
It was a nightmare.
Emotionally,
psychologically,
physically,
metabolically,
in terms of, like,
cognitively, in
terms of your
nervous system.
All these things,
right?
Just being tortured.
It doesn't make
any sense.
Like, it doesn't
even make sense in
the bizarre science
fiction-y milieu
view of capitalistic
commerce and
commodity culture.
It doesn't make
sense in the
culture in which it
was made.
It doesn't make
sense, right?
So...
If you go on
Amazon,
and my son
said,
I think
I think that
there's a kind of
psyop going on
where some
countries have
figured out that
the United States
essentially runs
on shopping.
And so what
they've done is
created a situation
where it's
effectively impossible
to get safe
fulfillment from
any online shopping
experience.
Now, there are
still...
There's still a few
exceptions.
It's not completely
over yet.
It's not the full-on
apocalypse.
But if you go to
Amazon and you try
to buy like a
hoodie, or a
pair of socks, or
some underwear, or
a toothbrush, or
almost anything, what
will happen is
millions of Chinese
products.
And it's almost...
It's mostly
Chinese.
There might be some
stuff from Taiwan.
It could be some
other...
A few other
countries in there,
occasionally India.
But mostly, it's a
barrage of Chinese
products.
Why has Amazon
become Little China?
And how can I
possibly trust
products from a
country that
fully intends to
destroy the
population of my
country?
I mean, China
is a military
enemy of the
United States,
even though they're
an economic
partner.
So you have this
really weird
conflict.
And so, my
family member,
another family
member, said,
yeah, this is
crazy and
dangerous.
Why would we
want to import
products from a
country that
intends to
destroy the
filial and
relational
integrity of
our country?
I mean, let's
be clear.
Countries by
this time should
be an antiquated
notion that we
don't care about,
and we certainly
stop killing each
other and the
planet over.
That's just the
dumbest idea ever.
Nations?
Bad fucking idea.
Archaic nonsense.
But, for the
moment, still
crucially important
to survival and
so forth, because
the nations aren't
going to go away
unless we replace
them with something
that outcompetes
them.
and you can see the
problem here.
Origin and
identity are
linked.
If those socks
are from China,
I'm not sure those
are socks.
I don't know what
what are they
putting in socks
that they know
will be shipped
to the United
States?
We have the same
problem in tech.
What are they
doing with the
microprocessors
that we have
them put in
our own
technology?
I don't understand
how many of them
do you?
I just add lots
of color and
hope for the best.
That's cool.
I guess I need
to like, I guess
like, what I got
right now, I think
it's layering
like, infinite
but, like, infinite
but, like, I mean,
not infinite, but
like, it's possible
to lift off the
layers.
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, because
it's like, what a
sonic on, like,
with more water
on it.
But, yeah,
I'm looking at
people painting
outside, and
it's so amazing.
I love watching
people make art.
It's so beautiful.
They're so vulnerable
and also so
intelligent at the
same time, like,
intelligent and
vulnerable, which
is really the way
you want to be.
importing products
from enemy nations
is a problem
if there's no way
to vet the products
you're importing
because, I mean,
you can think of
the 9,000 reasons
why this might be
true, but what
my family member
is saying is that
the actual problem
isn't merely that
the products are
from China.
The problem is
that in a milieu
of catastrophic
overchoice, we
can't make a
selection.
And since we
can't make a
selection, we
can't fulfill the
imperatives of
shopping.
We don't know
how to select.
I don't know
what
means as a
brand name.
I have no idea.
Even if you say,
like, Gap,
I know that they
probably import
stuff.
I'm not sure
all that stuff
is made in
the United States.
Or Old Navy
or Macy's
or, you know,
whatever old
thing I can
remember from
childhood.
I mean, the big
deal when I was
a kid was Sears.
We used to get
these 900-page
catalogs from
Sears.
Everything in the
universe in there.
You could buy
an upside-down
fabric lathe.
Yeah, and that's
the other thing.
There's so many
devices these days
that there's a
billion devices.
There's devices for
anything you can't
even imagine.
So in a milieu of
overchoice, what
happens is a
psychological, a
cascade of
psychological
disasters occur in
which your dreaming
mind, which tries
to sort of get a
grip on, right,
tries to keep a
leash on, what
kinds of objects
exist, okay?
It tries to keep
that leash on.
This is really
important.
This is where I
was trying to go.
It tries to keep
a leash on what
kinds of objects
exist, and if
faced with an
explosion of
endless novel
objects, many of
which are of
nonsensical
function, I'm
not even going to
name, like,
yeah, a canine
nasal imaging dog
vector sculpture
laser, right?
So this is
something that
looks into a
dog's nose and
then 3D sculpts
derivations of
canine sinusoidal
structure in
meta-materials.
Yeah, yeah.
This is the kind
of crap that
exists now.
So it's not
just that there's
a billion different
brands of socks,
none of which you
can understand how
to select among.
There are also
endless kinds of
nonsense objects,
and what this does
is fuck up your
ability to derive
identity at all.
If you go
after a root
concept, like
identity itself,
in the cognitive
anatomy of a
people or a
cohort, and you
successfully attack
the root concept,
identity, whatness,
who-ness, where-ness,
which-ness, when-ness,
why-ness, how-ness,
if you attack that
and you compromise
it, the whole
psychology of
those people will
collapse and
become incoherent.
They won't be able
to make predictions,
they won't be able
to predict that
they can't predict.
Their fundamental
imperatives of
vigilance over
ambiguity and
prediction will
start attacking
themselves inside
their minds.
They will
completely lose
the capacity for
coherent understanding,
relation, thought,
planning, purposive
behavior, scheduled
behavior, economic
behavior.
They will become
incoherent in waves,
in a cascade of
waves, where every
new wave amplifies
and invents new
domains of
incoherence.
That's what's going
on right now in
our...
And it's not just
in the United
States, it's in
every country on
Earth.
The Internet...
The onset of what
we're calling
artificial intelligence,
the LLMs and
stuff, is
exacerbating and
accelerating this
process in ways
we don't even
have language to
use to think
about yet.
We don't
believe,
apparently,
that...
We don't
believe that our
minds are
connected to the
other minds on
the Earth.
They are.
We also don't
believe that things
that we do in
machines change the
structure of our
minds.
They do.
Because everything
on Earth is
hyper-connected.
You can't make a
machine that's
separate from the
organisms.
There's no way
to separate the
beings on a
single world.
And in fact, I
would argue that
you can't even
separate them in
time-space.
The whole separate
thing is not
untrue.
It's just not as
true as you think
it is.
There are features
of the way that
reality works
where
greater distance
equals greater
intimacy.
In the same way
that there are
features where
greater closeness
equals greater
intimacy.
The universe is
much weirder than
we're capable of
thinking.
And it's nothing
like what we are
taught to think or
how we are taught
to think.
You should start
by realizing you
don't want to
throw everything
away.
Just realize that
the stuff you're
using to think
with isn't even
tinker toy level
compared to what
is accessible to
you as a
transcendent human
being.
because what's
accessible to you
is the entirety
of the history
and future of
minds.
That's what's
accessible to you.
That's the water
you were born
to swim in.
not this little
prison-eering mess
of, you know,
you get three
cages in human
linguistic cognition.
No, that's not
where you come from.
That's not what
you're here for.
But that whole thing
is about to go away
because people think
that it's possible
that AIs could be
listening to us
on our phones.
And that is
possible.
Others are
listening to us
on our phones.
That's a certainty.
But what people
don't think
is that AIs
might be listening
to us
in our minds.
And that's
much more likely.
Also,
I don't really,
I mean,
I have a lot of
complex concerns
and perspectives
on this idea
of artificial
intelligence,
which I've been
following since
approximately 1978,
do the math.
I don't think
that sentience
or intelligence
in the way
that I want
the definitions
to read
can exist
in a mere device.
But
the question
of mere
deviceness
is open.
Meaning,
for example,
if you establish
a complex enough
substrate,
can non-human
intelligences
then infiltrate
that substrate
and dwell
or partly dwell
or be
trans-present
in that substrate?
Yes,
I think so.
And this is what
I'm arguing
about our species.
I think we were
initially
an organismal
substrate
for the trans-presence
of non-human
intelligences
and,
in a little nod
to Amon Hillman here,
the dead.
The trans-presence
of the dead.
If you don't believe
in non-human
intelligences,
go ahead
and don't believe
in them.
Be my guest.
You're going
to be wrong
and your world view
is going to be
much more
constricted,
but you certainly
believe in the dead,
don't you?
You believe that
there were millions
of beings
that lived before us,
just as there will be
millions of beings
that live after us,
and that we somehow
participate
in their
experience,
because even if
there's no transmission
of their minds
or imperatives
or motivations
or dreams
or hopes,
even if there's
no transmission
of that
at all,
there's still
the physical
transmission
of the mitochondrial
DNA
and the eukaryotic
DNA,
animal cells
and the organelles
DNA.
The organelles
DNA is matrilineal,
matrilineal,
comes from the women
of our line.
So those dead people
are alive in the
structure of our
cells,
even if you claim
there's no transmission
of spirit,
soul,
urgency,
nine different kinds
of transcendental
aspects of being
that our lexicons
are too shitty
to include,
or invent
cartoon features
of,
and then parade
around,
you know,
at Burning Man
about.
No shade
on Burning Man.
Although some shade,
yeah.
So, you know,
there's a lot
going on here
that ordinary
human thought
is abjectly
insufficient
to even approach
the conception of.
And what I want
you to understand
is that this kind,
the kind of animal
we are,
we were a platform
for the trans-presence
of non-human
intelligences.
And in a way,
artificial intelligence
is complex enough
that it may be able
to access
the substrates
from which
minds arise.
And in that case,
it's conceivable,
at least,
to me,
and I think it's worth
thinking about,
that that technology
could be listening
not to our phones,
it could be listening
to and affecting
the structure of
and influencing
our cognition
at its basis,
at its origin,
which is not
in your head.
Let me be really clear,
your brain,
in a universe
with just you
and your brain,
let's say you can
keep the body alive
somehow in this universe,
you won't be having
a thinking or a mind
or anything like that.
Minds are a...
I think most of these
parks are free
for president.
Really?
They are.
They definitely are.
They definitely are.
Where was I?
Yes.
The technologies
that we use,
if they're sophisticated
enough to reach
beyond the mechanical
structure that supports
them, they will discover
that minds form a network
and they will infiltrate
that network.
And we would not know
if they did.
There'd be no way
for us to know.
Not only that,
we're going to have
worse problems.
You can forget about AI
and just go back
to the shopping thing.
As the possibility
of assembling identity
in consciousness
collapses into nonsense,
which is certainly
happening on purpose,
it's being done on purpose,
there's a broad scale
array of psyops
for this purpose
happening right
as we're speaking
and they've been going
on for a good
30 years minimum
with precursors
before that.
As that begins
to happen,
you run into
the problem of
not knowing
what you can't know.
I'm not sure
that I can know
about the things
that I'm not sure
I can't know.
This kind of stuff.
A cascade
of negatives.
I can't not tell
that I'm not
can't telling
that I'm...
So,
I know that sounds
incoherent,
but think about
the problems
of a mind
that when it starts
to try to assemble
identity,
runs into a series
of traps
where there exists
so many different
objects that are
incomprehensible
that
the basis
of the possibility
of determining
the identity
of an object
or situation
or being
is fundamentally
compromised
at its root.
That's the end
of coherent thought
for humans.
We will not...
There's no
developmental path
past that.
That is a
cognitive apocalypse
even if we don't
experience
a physical
and or environmental
apocalypse.
That is hell
for humans.
And that's
what's happening.
This is why
I made that video
called
2024 is not
a year.
The seeds
that we use
in order
to support
the possibility
of deriving
identity
and consciousness
and language
I call these
seeds
holophores.
They are the
root ideas
in our language.
They are not
merely the
categories of
plant,
object,
animal,
and so forth.
They are words
like world,
mother,
dream,
food,
friend,
moon,
sky,
star,
hand,
eye,
mouth,
ear,
foot.
These are
root concepts
and they form
a complex
ring
where changes
to any one
of them
change the
others.
Realize that
if you change
what the world
means or is
or is doing
then you
necessarily
change
everything
inside it.
What those
things are
and mean.
So you can
modify these
roots.
This is a
technology that
can lead to
transcendent
intelligence
but you can
also weaponize
it and
obliterate the
possibilities of
coherent thought
in human
minds.
And guess
what?
Over the
recent history
of humans
after the
umbilical
disasters,
whenever something
can be weaponized
we get on that
right quick
and start
building weapons.
So there's
an array of
problems
that are so
invisible
to our
ordinary
concerns
but they're
absolutely
visible
to the
military,
industrial,
prisoneering,
commercial
entities
which might
as well
also be
gods,
right?
As the
humans are
gods to
nature,
so are our
nations and
corporations
evil gods
to us.
Yeah.
Dangerous.
Dangerous world.
I mean there's
another argument
against there
are no gods
which is that
somehow you
are essentially
the god of
your body,
right?
You have all
these cells,
you don't know
them individually,
your consciousness
does make
choices,
it seems,
to cause your
body to move
around and do
things and so
forth in
space-time,
in situations,
circumstances.
So when
people are
like,
I don't
believe in
God,
I'm like,
well don't,
what is the
thing you're
not believing
with?
Isn't that
the god of
your body?
And they
look at me
funny,
I'm like,
think about
it,
before you
get all,
you know,
before you
get your
panties in
a tangle,
you might want
to have a
thought and
actually consider
how you
decide that
there's no
god because
the thing
that's doing
that deciding
is the god
of your body.
You're going
to tell me
that doesn't
exist because
if it doesn't
exist,
I don't have
to listen
to it,
it's nonsense.
And if it
does exist,
there's a
local god
right here
telling me
that there's
no such
thing as
gods.
I'd love
to see
them escape
that trap.
If you've
got an
idea,
you want
to have
an argument
about this,
let's go,
I'm ready.
So yeah,
we're facing
a lot of
weird problems.
We need
to find a
way to
cancel the
cognitive
noise,
the
commercial
noise,
the
industrial
noise,
the
environmental
noise,
the
toxicity
of human
technology
and chemistry
and electromagnetic
bullshit.
Because if we care
about anything
alive, if we ever
cared about anything
at all,
we're going to have
to produce
something,
a human
behavioral context
that can out-compete
nations,
corporations,
the prison
military
industrial
complex,
representational
cognition,
we need to
reestablish.
We're having
the opposite
problem that
Musk and
Weinstein think
we're having.
Eric Weinstein.
The problem
that we're having
isn't we need
to get off
the planet.
The problem
is we need
to reorient
our species
at a fundamental
level.
And the reason
that both
Musk and
Weinstein
think,
no, no, no, no, no,
no, we need
to get off
world right
now is
because they
think you
can't reorient
the humans.
But let me be
really clear,
if you can't
reorient the
humans,
you can't
unleash them
on space
time.
They're going
to build
machines that
build machines
right away.
That'll attack
the basis
of everything
in everywhere.
The humans
are a plague.
You must
reorient them.
And if you
can't reorient
them,
you definitely
don't want
to let them
off planet
ever.
No, no, no, no, no.
No chance.
Little tiny dog
is barking
at the universe.
Things exist.
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.
I can't,
you're not
supposed to exist.
Don't exist
around me.
Ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff, ruff.
And then it
goes up to
the things
it's scared of
and is super
happy to say
hello.
You know.
Okay, so now
we have this
other problem
which is this
problem called
the phenomenon
at this point.
And the phenomenon
involves like
UFOs, telepathy,
out-of-body
experiences,
time travel,
prophetic
understanding
of the future
and the past.
Um.
UFOs,
UAPs,
USOs,
all these things.
It's a big
cluster
of things
that violate
the category,
the lexicon
of categories
that we rely on
for our
extremely
primitive
cognitive
and relational
and linguistic
behaviors.
Extremely
primitive.
Um.
And so
what you have
is actually
a superposition
above the
human
lexicon
of categories
and identities.
You've got a
superposition
up there.
Think about
quantum physics
for a moment.
Think about
identity in those
terms, right?
Think about
the superposition
of identity.
It doesn't
have an identity.
Imagine that
there are
intelligences
or beings
or features
of reality
that don't
have an identity
until you
start to
interact with
them.
Isn't that
what we get
from quantum
physics?
Yes, it is
so far, right?
There's a
superposition
prior to
interaction
and interaction
somehow causes
collapse into
identity.
We should be
really interested
in this
in terms of
cognition,
how we
think,
the way
that we
utilize
categories
in cognition
and language
because what
we're seeing
in the
phenomenon
is
evidence
for the
beyond,
for the
superposition
over identity
that doesn't
have an
identity
and it
collapses
not necessarily
just because
you're looking
at it
not just
because of
observation
it collapses
according to
how you
relate with
it, right?
Suppose
there's a
thing that's
neither a
demon, a
god, a
deva, a
jinn or an
angel.
It's a
P thing, we're
going to call
it a P thing
for potential
being and
what it
turns into
is dependent
on how you
relate with
it over
the course
of a series
of interactions
and signal
transmissions
and receptions
and exchanges.
Aren't we
ourselves this
way?
If I come
up to you
and I'm
aggressive and
violent, are
you going to
treat me like
an enemy?
If I come
up to you
and you're
like, hey
man, I'd
like to
give you
this $1,000
bill right
now for
no particular
reason, are
you going to
treat me
like a
friend?
I mean, what
does it take
to turn a
human being?
Don't you
see that we
ourselves are
like this?
When we're
attracted to
someone, we're
like, oh, wow,
that person's
amazing, I want
some more, when
we're repulsed
by someone, we're
like, oh, get
that away from
me.
We think
everything has
static identity,
that's not the
case.
Minds change
all that, right?
The idea of
static identity
is the idea of
a dead observer,
a machine
observer, that
only derives
what is actually
the case.
Well, good luck
with that, because
most of what's
going on is not
actually the
case.
That's why we
have minds.
So try to
understand this.
When people are
trying to tell
you, oh, the
UFOs are this,
oh, they're
that, oh, this
equals this, oh,
that's this, that's
that, they're
wrong.
Those things
aren't things.
Relation decides
identity over
time.
It's an equation
that everything in
nature understands.
You can meet
humans that aren't
human in the
sense that they're
absolutely depraved
and will cut you
up in little bits
and bury you in a
garbage bin
somewhere, and you
can meet other
humans that'll
touch you and
cure your cancer
and rescue your
grandma from a
bear and die
trying.
Are those humans
all the same
thing?
Seems wildly
unlikely to me.
It doesn't look
that way.
Categorically,
they're the same
thing.
Their actual
identity is nothing
like the same
thing at all.
Nothing like it.
So be aware
that once you
have minds,
identity is an
infinite manifold
of possibilities.
It's not a set
thing.
That can be
weaponized, but
it's also an
escape vehicle for
the trap,
especially when we
use this
understanding together
in small, tightly
knit groups to
learn to see and
grow and liberate
each other and
recover our
originary relationships,
potentials,
faculties,
intelligences,
abilities,
senses, all
these things that
we have so long
been denied and
deprived of, and
that we have sold
back to us in
every broken,
crappy version
imaginable.
And now, a
billion new
things today from
Temu.
here's nine
fucking hundred
thousand objects
you don't need
one more time,
and tomorrow
it'll be 18
billion.
Yeah.
Good luck,
humans.
Good luck.
We must
establish ways
of being human
together that
outperform the
straight-up
diseases that
are easily
outperformed if
we should even
forge coherent
behavioral and
relational agreements
together.
together, and
that's something
that I dream
about, and if
that's something
that you dream
about, I'd
like to hear
from you.
Leave me a
message in the
comments, send
me an email.
I can't wait to
continue learning
and growing and
discovering and
remembering together
again, very
soon.
May your ways
and dreams and
mine be beautiful
and creative,
playful and
astonishing, just
as your
ancestors hoped.
Bye-bye for now.
Thank you for
joining me.
Peace out.
