hello everybody
welcome
what a wonderful thing it is to be able to speak and hear and see and touch and taste and smell
and feel and remember not just remember in the sense of bring to mind that which was previously experienced thought known spoken done but to remember in the sense of to be
brought back into communal awareness, unity, recognition, priority
one of my friends was quoting a very strange
somewhat megalomaniacal yet brilliant man
a man I've never much trusted to be entirely clear
but this doesn't mean, I've often spoken about how I don't go to a restaurant and order everything on the menu
this is a quote that I caught from Eric Weinstein
maybe he, maybe he originated that comparison, that metaphor, that analogy but it's a really good one
in any case
my friend was quoting, excuse me, quoting Alistair Crowley
and he said
I am divided for the sake of love
think carefully about this matter
because the existence
of distinct beings and moments and situations
and purposes
thank God
it's so funny what I heard someone saying right then
you know
imagine
imagine
imagine that we were all having exactly the same life
exactly the same experience
exactly the same
responses, thoughts, concerns
and there was no diversity whatsoever
in our humanity
or even in our location
if you could have
if you had a choice of just being one
being
or being able to
sort of
divide yourself into five
let's say
and let's say you could not merely divide yourself into five
distinct bodies
but each one of them could be
unique
so that they looked different
and perhaps
three of them were women
and two of them were men
or
two of them were men
and
two of them were women
and one was
what we would call non-binary
people would say
no, no
let me call five of them non-binary
okay, yeah
do whatever you like
but
and then
suppose further that you could send them into different times
right
so in the morning you divide
into these five
beings
and then suppose that
further
okay, you could send them into different times
anytime
you wanted
to live
that day
and then at night
they would come back together
and become you
and all of their experiences
their unique experiences
would be shared
and you would be the position above
their distinctions
right
you would be
the moon position
above the world
of their experiences
they would all be you
you would forget your unity
while you were separately in them
in the daytime
but then in the evening
after supper
when they all
come back together as you
the profundity
of their unique
experience
would enrich
your consciousness
and your intelligence
and your creativity
and your playfulness
and your concern
and your memory
now further imagine
that you can split
not merely into five different humans
but five of any kind of being
any organism
any being
one of you could be an angel
one
a dragonfly
one
a living world
one
a star
one
a human
now you cannot be sure
that this is not how it is
because we could be unaware
of the divisions that happen
just before we awaken
and think
that we are the same person
we were yesterday
and will be again
tomorrow
we are easily deceived
by structures
in consciousness
expectations
senses
feelings
we are not only deceived
by them
but we are easily deceived
when we are deceived
many of us have heard
people say
or write things
that imply
that all the beings
are you
and when I
when I speak of
remembering
as being
re
unified
you should understand
something about the
etymology
of the English word
religion
now I don't know
by heart
its origins
and most
etymologies
trace origins
back to
proto-indo-european
which
Amon Hillman
says
is a British
conspiracy theory
I think
that's a hilariously
courageous
and possibly
brilliant thing
to say
but
this word
religion
it means
something
it means
okay
do you
understand
the word
ligament
right
the ligament
if I understand
this correctly
the ligaments
in our
they sort of
mean alignment
see we have
the same
fragment
the same
perhaps phoneme
here
L-I-G-N
align
L-I-G
lig
ligament
religion
this
lign√©
it's a
it's a
strand
that
connects
like
like
the result
of
careful
sewing
where
two things
become
unified
by the
thread
that
interpenetrates
them both
in a
pattern
and
this
re-lig
it means
to
re-
connect
you know
in
Mary Shelley's
unimaginably
brilliant
work
Frankenstein
my god
what
was she
nineteen
or something
when she
wrote this
Jesus
Christ
that
woman
I suspect
Pierce Burns
Shelley's
lover
at the
time
or around
then
they were
lovers
when she
writes
Frankenstein
she imagines
the
surgeon
the
magus
the
wizard
the
sorcerer
robbing
graves
and
assembling
a man
from the
salvaged
parts
of a
number of
dead
bodies
and
with
equal
genius
Mel
Brooks
with
equal
but
divergent
genius
Mel
Brooks
creates
the
film
Young
Frankenstein
which
is
maybe
the
greatest
comedic
film
of my
lifetime
I'm
willing
to
nominate
it
by the
way
nomin
to
nominate
basically
means
to name
this
nomin
it comes
from a
fragment
nim
like
paranim
antonym
homonym
anto being
opposite
para
being
similar
homo
being
the same
I think
homonym
I might
have that
one wrong
it probably
means like
homo
probably
means like
likeness
which
I don't
know if
there's
even a
word
paranim
this is
a word
I thought
I invented
but we
can never
be sure
we've
invented
a word
in fact
suppose our
mind was
never
distinct
you didn't
invent
your
the only
thing
you didn't
invent
English
with which
you know
the thing
you use
to name
and point
at stuff
in thought
sometimes
and speech
no no
that's
that's an
inheritance
from
homo
sapiens
sapiens
varietal
you know
british
americanus
or something
right
like
there's a
lineage
there
so
although
we might
imagine
our mind
to be
unique
and personal
in fact
the stuff
we use
to forge
it
is
communal
so this
religion
idea
it means
to sew
back
together
that which
had been
disparate
had been
parted
and
fascinatingly
I don't
know if
this is
actually
explored
in
frankenstein
the book
I'm
I doubt
I've ever
read that
book
actually
I've seen
so many
renditions
of the
story
one sting
was particularly
fascinating
in its
time
but perhaps
because
the quote
monster
was
I think
in that
version
female
and beautiful
but you
can imagine
that
okay
think
carefully
about the
metaphor
in a new
way
right
let's
cast
let's
cast
this
frankensteinian
monster
in a
little bit
of a
different
light
so the
light I'm
going to
shine on
this
monster
we're
going to
imagine
that
the
limbs
and the
chunks
of the
limbs
are each
from
different
humans
and we
could imagine
them as
some male
some female
etc
imagine it
however you
wish
but
if we
sew
together
the limbs
of dead
bodies
to produce
a single
human
body
form
anyway
a kind
of a
golem
in a
way
but
then what
we would
have
is something
like the
figure I
presented at
first
and it was
not my
intention to
introduce
frankenstein
later
in case that
seems very
artful of
me
I can't
really take
credit for
that because
it's an
accident
of my
wandering
concerns
but if we
weave
together
the limbs
and organs
of a
number of
dead people
to produce
a unified
body
which we
might
then imagine
to acquire
a soul
and become
a mind
is that
not similar
to how we
are
inside us
because
how many
dead people
does it
take
to turn
on
how many
dead people
does it
take to
screw in
the light
bulb of
a human
soul
and one
of the
answers
is all
of them
but there
are many
answers
not just
one
I have
one photograph
of my
great
grandfather
aged
approximately
19
his
resemblance
to my
son
is
startling
my
grandmother
must have
thought
how could
it be
how could
it be
how could
it be
I was
watching
something
very
profound
there's a
sprinkler
spraying water
into the
sunlight
and it
looked like
a rain
of stars
looked like
a
disaster
like the
stars were
falling in
the daylight
like shooting
stars of
light
but then
when it
hit me
it was
cold
and wet
not bright
and warm
like the
light
reflected
in the
in the
water
streaming
across
space
from the
sprinkler
there's
another
metaphor
there
which
is
many
droplets
of
being
condensing
to
forge
a
human
or a
blue
jay
or a
sage
plant
or a
mountain
or tree
many
droplets
plants
we are
not like
frankenstein
in that
chunks of
other
beings
are
sewn
together
to create
us
it's
much
more
elegant
than
that
the
streams
of
human
urgency
and
form
of
dreaming
and
motivation
of
hope
of
desperation
of loss
of fear
of trial
and tribulation
these are
woven
together
we come
to birth
to bring
these
myriad
factors
into
communion
and
solution
and
re-solution
and
re-cognition
and
remembering
how ironic
then
that the
foundation
of that
process
is
lethal
in the
sense
of the
river
lethe
in which
we are
said
to be
dipped
between
lives
thus
forgetting
all
previous
existences
this
of course
presumes
that the
human soul
is singular
a fact
I am
inclined
to both
be willing
to entertain
but also
to doubt
suppose
that all
past lives
are your
life and
all future
lives are
your life
but they
are uniquely
your life
so they
are also
uniquely
the life
of your
mother
your neighbor
your neighbor
your enemy
the oak tree
the salmon
the bear
the elk
the school
of fish
the coral
reef
the plankton
the whale
and what
you would
find if you
went looking
for your
previous life
is not
necessarily
your previous
life
but it
might appear
to be this
it might feel
this way
too
it is
the nearest
neighbor
in the
cloud of
constellations
of souls
that lives
are derived
from
you can
see it
as a single
soul
you can
see it
as a
constellation
of soul
like
elements
persisting
and transforming
being added
to and
subtracted
from and
transformed
and developed
over time
have at least
these two
views
and a
third and a
fourth that
are more
insightful than
me
remembering
so yes
we must
undergo
the great
forgetting
and this
happens to
us in a
single
lifetime
because
we forget
most of
us what
it was
like
to be
a child
to be
new
once more
or perhaps
for the
first time
to the
human
form
and to
the
possibilities
of that
form
its
nervous
system
its
capacities
for
development
uniqueness
expression
play
resurrection
of the
ancestors
who each
contributed
their genes
and spirits
and urgencies
to
our
conception
it's
funny
isn't it
that we
call
put my
windscreen
on here
quite breezy
up here
we call
the
processes
that
originate
thought
the
same
word
in
english
that
we
call
the
processes
that
originate
an
embryo
the
same
word
in
religion
for the
processes
that
originate
a
messiah
conception
conception
conception
conception
there's
some
italians
here
i wonder
if they
know that
i'm italian
probably not
a look at
my nose
would tell
the tale
you see
lineage
and ligament
it binds
us together
we recognize
people
of our
own
lineage
our
own
ethnicity
we have
a special
bond
with those
people
now
truly we
have a
special
bond
with all
beings
all
organisms
all animals
all humans
all
ethnicities
these are
all our
people
my people
are people
all of
the different
peoples
that are
my people
so i want
to present
another
figure
imagine
that
when you
fall asleep
you become
all of the
beings
in all
of time
the gods
the angels
the stars
the planets
the mountains
the forests
the animals
the plants
on all the
worlds
you become
all of them
you fall
asleep
no longer
are you
singular
you are all
the beings
in all
of time
you are the
being
who dwells
in unity
within what i
will call
the living
waters
the feminine
principle
of pure
undifferentiated
potential
as you fall
asleep
your singularity
disappears
with you
and as you
dream
you dream
with the
mind
of all
beings
but from a
unique position
in that
hyper structure
your position
right
so your
singularity
still
your uniqueness
your individuality
still has an
effect
it's still
part of the
equation
because you
leap into
the communal
pool
of all
beings
becoming
being
resurrected
from your
individuality
being
religion
reunified
frankenstein
frankenstein
yes
from
the moment
and place
and history
and position
that you
last held
here
and so you
enter the
water of
being
and you
become the
entire
water
and then
you dream
and then
when you
awaken
you collapse
back into
apparently
physically
distinct
selfness
the self
word is
really hilarious
I think of it
as a snake
elf
snake elf
of course
what elf
means
isn't merely
that beautiful
vision
from Tolkien
it's something
truly profound
that that
vision
points toward
but does not
capture
that was
very strange
what just
happened
there
is that a
mouse
because it
sounded
like a
lizard
possibly even
the one
creature I
nearly never
see here
snake
yes so
imagine that
as you fall
asleep
you become
all beings
from a unique
position within
the hyper
structure
and as you
awaken
you are
again
apparently
but only
apparently
distinct
individuated
and you
forget
having been
all beings
it's very
difficult to
remember having
been all the
beings
with what
mind will you
remember that
not the mind
of your waking
self
that's the mind
that remembers
you being
distinct
its memory
is for
distinction
unless that
memory is
trained
to other
purposes
by ardent
desire
and practice
and adoration
and if
anything
if anything
has
gravitas
in
becoming
that
with which
we entrust
the training
of memory
do you know
what this is
yeah it's
sagebrush
smells amazing
doesn't it
yeah it's
awesome to
see you
rubbing it
I love to
get that
smell on my
skin
it's flowering
this one
yeah
if anything
is worthy
of sovereignty
over the
training of
imagination
and memory
it's reverence
it's adoration
it's wonder
it's awe
if we use
these to
train
our minds
our bodies
to practice
in the
aura of
we will
transcend
the traps
of our
mundanity
we will
transcend
them
and then
like a
climber
who's
achieved
a high
position
we can
reach down
and pull
our children
and our
ancestors
and the
future
of our
people
out of the
traps
they've
lain so
long
encumbered
by
to remember
to have
senses
take a
moment and
look at
your body
at its
form
look at
your hand
open your
hand and
look at it
on the
inside
and see
the astonishing
profundity
of that
evolutionary
development
and inheritance
that you've
acquired
as a human
being
flex your
fingers
move them
in a
in a
sequence
imagine
caressing
one
whom you
adore
or
the keys
of a
piano
or
sculpting
an
immortal
form
in stone
or clay
or
drawing
with them
reaching
into the
soil
planting
a tree
imagine
rescuing
an
injured
animal
with those
hands
imagine
carefully
artfully
setting
the broken
bone
of an
animal
so that
it will
not
perish
or be
crippled
imagine
writing
something
so beautiful
that a
thousand
souls
in the
future
will be
lifted
from the
poverty
of their
despair
imagine
your
hand
and just
as amazing
your eye
and more
primordial
and brilliant
your mouth
and tongue
and nose
your ears
with which
you receive
what I
craft
with my
voice
but it
is not
my voice
that is
crafting
this
it is
the voices
of my
ancestors
having been
unified
by my
ardent
desire
to fulfill
their urgent
dreams
their hopes
what they
worked their
entire lives
in the
hope
of achieving
of transmitting
to their
children
their children's
children
this is
true
religion
my voice
is the
local voice
in time
and the
waking
world
but it
is not
my voice
it does
not belong
to me
the least
interesting
aspect of
my voice
is when
I
darinize
it
ah these
machines
they're a
plague
I despise
them
one day
there will
be none
here
I don't
know if
they are
intrinsically
a plague
and I
benefit
from their
existence
just as
you do
without
without
machines
I'd not
be making
these
recordings
and we
would be
unacquainted
you and
I
our lineages
would remain
unligne
ununified
not woven
together
so it's
so it's
not that
they have
no
virtues
it's
just
that
the
humans
have
no
idea
what
not
to
do
with
them
so they
do
every
possible
thing
and most
of those
things
are
horrific
once
I was
shown
you know
you can
be shown
a thousand
years of
experience
from a
million
me
over
the
span
of four
seconds
your mind
is capable
of receiving
transmissions
of information
that are
nothing like
the strangely
slow
absurd
chunking
poverties
we call
communication
but once
I was
shown
the histories
of many
living worlds
at once
perhaps
thousands
of them
in an
image
that was
fraught
with emotion
and I
saw how
many of
them
perished
before they
had time
to produce
something as
sophisticated
as the wing
of a bird
or the eye
of a human
or an octopus
or a whale
or a
hummingbird
or a
praying mantis
or a
dragon
fly
even a
house
fly
most worlds
don't last
long
they don't
there's a
there's a sort
of a tempo
there's a
there's a number
of variables
right
how old
is the
star
how young
is the
star
how stable
is the
star
how old
is the
planet
how young
is the
planet
how stable
is it
in its
orbit
does it
encounter
impact
ites
you have
to have
a lot
of things
go right
for a living
planet
to prosper
long and
stably
enough
to produce
eyes made
of living
water
hands
feet
wings
tentacles
photophores
the coloring
cells on
the skins
of cephalopods
whose name
somewhat
escapes me
all these
adaptations
these are
the
imprimatur
of a
long
and stable
planet
where physical
memory
is rich
with innovation
and sustained
transmission
of evolutionary
adaptations
our world
is such a
world
and as such
is so precious
to call it
priceless
is an insult
the concept
of price
is meaningless
without a world
like this one
to remember
there are kinds
of memory
that are so
profound
that they
unify
the branches
into which
human knowledge
has been
divided
so that
any thought
you have
is relevant
in music
art
perspective
math
physics
dance
linguistics
semantics
archaeology
history
all these
things
one
reunified
in consciousness
these are
the kinds
of thoughts
our minds
were made
for
how few
of us
will ever
taste them
perhaps
we get
the
a hint
a hint
of them
in
certain
kinds
of experiences
dreaming
more than a few
hints in there
some forms
or modes
of trance
some forms
or modes
of ecstasy
and perhaps
some
intoxicants
incline us
in this
direction
particularly
if
our purposes
in becoming
in taking
the intoxicants
are thus
inclined
to
anamnesis
and
religion
not the
thing
that the
humans
do
and call
this
no
the
actual
stuff
remembering
drawing
back
into
communal
unity
that
which was
previously
made
distinct
now
there are
other
models
of this
the
genji
lamp
is my
favorite
you can
find that
historically
in my
videos
it's a
very
powerful
model
but I
wanted
today
to
treat
a bit
of this
topic
in my
own
attempt
to
remember
and to
become
an
amnoetic
in my
thought
concern
and speech
as
as always
I am
grateful
for this
time
together
for your
attention
for the
fact that
our world
fragile
and beautiful
as she
is
still
exists
the humans
have not yet
drawn it
into
apocalyptic
crisis
or at
least
if they
have
those
catastrophes
are hidden
in a
million
different
branches
that have
not yet
unified
into a
world
ending
disaster
may your
ways and
minds be
beautiful
and blessed
may your
dreams be
rich
and fluorescent
I look
forward to
learning
and exploring
together
again
very soon
thank you
for joining
me
bye bye
for now
