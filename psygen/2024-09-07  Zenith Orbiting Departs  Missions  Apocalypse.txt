hello everybody welcome so much appreciation for those of you who take
the time to listen and explore with me so much gratitude to all of you who
accompany me on these little journeys together
I want to acknowledge the passing of one of my very dearest friends Eric Landeros
on Facebook known as Zenith Orbiting this is one of the one of my very dearest friends we've been
friends for about 10 years Eric was a brilliant human being extremely heartful loving honest
had incredible integrity he would always resist when humans were playing the kinds of games that
go after the lowest hanging fruit he would just naturally not go there with others
which sometimes puzzled them
I loved him like my own family like my son he was a brilliant artist and
um a very skillful tattoo artist also a brilliant musician
and um one of the kindest and gentlest and most profoundly aware humans I've ever come across in
my life I will miss him
extremely
he listened to a lot of my recordings
we met through Facebook we became fast friends
we often talked every day or every other day
we would share about our dreams and lives and he had a fabulous sense of humor it was very fun
to entertain him with little comedy routines and jokes and he would
he was very good at playing playing back you know at hitting the ball back right over the net
so we had a lot of laughter I have I have some notes from some of our conversations where the laughter turned into insight
honestly Eric was like an angel
and he was such a light in my life that uh quite frankly
it's very difficult to understand how to just keep going without him
he had recently gotten a job at Old Navy in LA where he lived he lived in Pacoima
um he introduced me recently to the show Severance
which was really fascinating I love the theme we were working on learning the theme
together how to play it um and he also he would occasionally send me videos
he sent me um raised by wolves Ridley Scott's one of Ridley Scott's recent endeavors that is uh
quite trippy I'm still I'm still watching it he and I both had an extreme fondness for the character known as mother
in that show um he was like just wait till you see what happens Darren
I was like yeah I I mean how can you not love her she's
she's vengeance you know vengeance on a heartstring
and he was like yeah mother for president and we both laughed
he was really into motorcycles
and um
he had a custom scooter
that he worked on all the time and was very careful to always cover up
with a lot of tarps at night so that people wouldn't deface it or
try to steal pieces of it it was a kind of a low rider thing it's very cool
um
um I think what I'm going to do is uh when I finish this video which I'm going to dedicate to him
I'm gonna uh put put a couple of photos of him and his bike on on the the accompanying screen
um
he was a guitar player very very talented really unique kind of multi-strumming style
um he really liked
uh
Asian culture but particularly um
I think uh Korean culture
and
liked some k-pop bands really he had he had an incredible sense of aesthetics
very aesthetically sensitive extremely relationally sensitive
highly sensitive person soft and beautiful
in contradiction to his superficial appearance
in in images that he took he would often
appear to be scowling and look look like a tough guy covered in tattoos
a very futuristic very blade runner-y aesthetic
but he as an actual friend was
steadfast and loyal and brilliant
again just such integrity in that young man
I'll miss him
apparently on his way home from work on the night of august 9th
a drunk man in an SUV
crossed the center line and killed him on his scooter
this is as much as I've been able to determine
um I didn't find out until about a month later we often didn't talk for
there were times when there was a significant span between our calls
and his new job had kept him very busy he had mentioned in a recent text
the last message that he sent me was a photograph of a strangely colored cloud
that he thought was very peculiar
this was a couple days before he passed away maybe three days before
I have had some contact from him in dreaming
which was very reassuring
immediately after finding out about his death at night
we had we had some conversations
late in the night in my dreams and they were reassuring
I could tell it was him because his characteristic sense of humor was evident
and he was aware of what had occurred
Eric was a bit of a foodie
he enjoyed
well-prepared meals
and he was complaining in our conversation that uh
they don't have any restaurants over there so
this is you know it's it's kind of a problem
i'm gonna miss him really a lot
so let's all have a thought for my friend
and wish him
a beautiful and powerful
journey
and that whatever resources or
relationships he needs for that journey
will be
generously furnished to him
all of you who listen to me have known his mind if you have known mine
because within
my life
he was a constant inspiration i was always
always thinking about him
so yeah what you've when you've heard from me
you know this this is sort of one of the topics i wanted to talk about
we think we have individual minds
and the more we're isolated from others the more that can become true
which might be part of the machinations
of our cultures that keep us isolated
and want us to think that we are alone
and that our mind is a possession
that exists in a kind of a head sack or you know skull box or something
it's not impossible to produce
a situation in which that is functionally true
but it's not our nature our nature is to form minds together
like what i would call
i'm not trying to steal burroughs's
um
burroughs and i think burroughs and geisen wrote a book together called the third mind
but the third mind
is the mind that arises between us especially when we agree together
that we have a beautiful or noble or playful or heroic
purpose that we agree to pursue very single hilarious single-mindedly
when that's our orient or orienting intention humans are born we're pot animals we're born for
um
impossible missions right that's why that that idea is so compelling you know
aliens probably have a riddle
what animal makes millions of films about impossible missions but rarely goes on them
ha ha ha ha homo sapiens sapiens on earth right endless films about forming a small
highly skillful committed team willing to risk their lives to solve a problem that's afflicting
the planet or you know the children or the mothers or everybody
um
to whatever degree we're willing to do this
we've got a library of how-to books in film
that we could crib from and improve upon together
and that's something i deeply believe in
perhaps more now more than ever i think when i was a little younger
i was like darren you know you got to be a bit more conservative uh you sure you want to lead people
into the the mouth of the monster on a you know on a mission that may well fail get some of them hurt
um you don't want to be like a cult leader or anything right i'm like no no i don't want to do that
on the other hand
the safety of our boxes
is intoxicating and deadening
and draws us into
a habitual
kind of
situational cowardice
which isn't like actively cowardly
but isn't actively heroic either and so becomes cowardly sort of by default
right i gotta what use is it protecting something that perhaps you were born to give away anyway
right and this is why we have
the military the military captures
and not just the men of course historically in modern times it was mostly men
i'm in hillman will tell you some stuff about those uh pelaskians and their women
archers and horsewomen and crazy brilliant medusai and all that stuff but but for most of
our history the men are what gets captured and
uh
what gets captured is our willingness to give up our lives for something astonishing beautiful because
wow how miserable is it to die in a box having carefully preserved
your safety and your physical body and perhaps your wealth
well all around you the potentials of our
our world of organisms of beings here of our humanity
of our prowess and skillfulness and nobility and intelligence
and fierceness and creativity
and hopes for
reconciliation for rebalancing
for justice not as vengeance but as the establishment of a way worth living together
are dying on the vine
or being shredded and sold back to us in
and broad travesties of
films and novels about lives we'll never lead
together
so
you know we should have a thought
thought about the difference between
the kind of slavery
that looks pretty shiny because you know you can buy nice stuff and your house is so pretty inside
your car is very clean
everything's hygienic
those boxes are filled with swarming rectangles
that lull you
into a false sense of success
when you weren't really doing anything worth succeeding at
and look i'm not speaking to you i'm talking about myself
right
this isn't me pointing the finger at others
i couldn't say these things if i didn't know them firsthand
and frankly i'm scared of pain
and my human life is fragile
but at this late
you know stage of the game
i don't want to get to the end of my life which could come tomorrow
and realize like oh i should have bet i should have bet the whole damn thing
on one or two beautiful moves
that would have been worthy
now we men
are much more inclined
to this wager and this is what is captured
by the military sports teams
to some degree
rock bands
um
music you know musical bands
uh
credence and led zeppelin and
who's i thinking of
oh god
yeah
i'm gonna i'm gonna make the suggestion without naming them so that you can you can have the
the joy of um
using your own memory but
uh sweet home alabama free bird right this band
um
you know acdc
uh
we men
are born ready
to go on missions watch young boys playing and you can say well they're just being scripted by their culture
it's not untrue
but their culture is also riding the intrinsic
uh predilections
of those young boys
all right
um
capturing those predilections
all right those boys want to go on missions they want adventure
and um i'm not claiming the girls don't by the way nothing like that
um
but the
i'm gonna get in some trouble here but i'm willing to
you know
people some people may make claims
about and i'm willing to listen we can have a talk anytime they want
that there's not really such a thing
as a female or a male um i'll never believe that
i'm willing to entertain that perspective
for sure i'm even willing to champion that perspective right
i'm just not going to subscribe
in my route
for reasons that are hard to elucidate but have to do with
um
i want both versions of the principle right i want the non-binary principle
and i want the binary principle i don't want to throw one away for the other
and for me
be you know
however i may have come to this to being how i am as a human and someone who thinks about things
um the principles of the concepts the super categories of the masculine and the feminine
are important there aren't two genders that make children
there's just one that's a real thing in in my view
and the women you know they make children in their bodies
all of the men were organs in their bodies before they were anything at all
so in a sense you could say we all start out female
it's the if you will master gender
because without that gender there ain't no genders
so you know you can make up any noises or arguments you like
but um the women generally speaking and there are many beautiful exceptions
have been librarians and doctors healers dreamers visionaries oracles
in some cases warriors
mothers they make food from their own body they feed from their own body their children this is
noble if anything is noble it's got to be this
and so
it's not that they're not adventurous
it's that the kinds of adventure they are generally with all exceptions noted well suited for
the people that they are in the world are different from the strange and often militaristic adventures of men
and let's be clear in many indigenous cultures not all primarily the men were hunters as i understand it
and you know new information may come where where i have to give give up this illusion
the men went out they went forth um and they brought the
they brought
the rewards of their often dangerous
adventuring back to the village of the tribes
primary place
uh nomadic or not and um and so the men were over many many generations evolutionarily
imbued
with the proclivity
to go forth
to take risks to go on the missions
um
to die to be injured to come home
empty-handed often or not come home
but but often to like bring home the uh
i'm not going to use the proverbial meat here
um but you you know which one i mean
and so you know we are born with this urge
not so much of course to preserve our life and protect
uh the tribe
the beloveds
even if there are other men
um the children
the ancestors the home
the place
the living place
protect
nourish
right bring assets back
which in large-scale cultures is probably the origin of what we think of as colonization
right just go out there and obliterate some stuff and bring back the goods
but um
what i'm trying to get at is that we were born
expecting to be involved in heroic missions together
and our cultures capture this urge
they counterfeit it
they enslave us and they sell it back to us
at ever-increasing prices
um
see the hoverfly population here
sorry i'm talking to someone who's near me
the thing i wanted to show them is not continuing
so um just give me a moment people occasionally you're going to hear a very high-pitched
peep sound you'll notice this as we're walking around
that will cue you in that a male hummingbird is doing this very crazy thing which is actually
related to what i'm talking about right it's going to fly straight up in the air very slowly
and then it's going to do this diving it's going to make this beep and then it's going to do this
diving j thing that's just nuts right and it just happened there but we'll see it again
i'll draw your attention to it later so you can
participate in that amazing stuff
you know we can pretend that there's no such thing as gender specialization what you're going
to find and if you look in the actual biology is differences in brain structure muscle mass bone mass
um uh particularly diff like i think um women and left-handers generally have a little more corpus
callosum men if i remember right i could be getting this wrong you you can look this stuff up to correct
me or but men have a little more uh superficial gray matter if i remember right so women and left-handers
more more connective okay it's weird to call that tissue connective um it's not the hippocampus it's
the um corpus callosum yeah more corpus callosum that isn't just connective tissue that corpus callosum
that's also tissue that distinguishes the two hemispheres and keeps signals from propagating across them
right um and i might even have this backwards it might be that
no no i'm pretty sure it's women have more connective tissue
see that magenta did you see him yeah watch watch his spot because if that sunlight hits him
you're gonna see like this bright flash of magenta which i think is so trippy given our conversations
um there's all kinds of physical differences not the least of which is the difference between a womb
with ovaries a vagina and a penis with testicles
these are not the same thing folks sorry to you know uh interrupt your fantasies
you're often surgically you know fantasies that without surgery would be pretty hard to support
uh there are two different genders and yes nature is rarely explicit she you know she's gonna she's
gonna blur the she's gonna blur the terrain somewhere in there um usefully right with anomalous
intersex creatures and so forth and of course there's plenty of features of nature where both of the
sexes are evinced in a single organism um hermaphroditic stuff but as far as us mammals go
uh you know we're primarily a two-pronged gender species
and there is really weird stuff we probably shouldn't be called mammals we should be
my my friend um dr dr b was saying the other day that we probably shouldn't be called mammals we
should have been called placentals we were discussing a recent paper that pointed out specific
transformations in a retro transposon that were appear to be causally related to
autistic and or schizophreniform
cohorts of humans cohorts that we we might clinically describe this way
um actual humans will vary from all descriptions there's a problem where um
in in people with this specific
trait or array of traits and he
dr b said that uh
uh it was likely that this little span of our of our human genome is one of the spans from which we
got big brains in the first place but there's a problem where
novelty that might normally produce dopamine and thus um interest
uh curiosity
under under circumstances where this specific these specific traits or genes
are different perhaps these retro transposons i could actually name them it's the sushi ishi
i think sushi ishi if i remember right i can't it's hard to remember it's very complicated
um when this
retro transposon undergoes a specific structural change what happens for some of us is that novelty produces
um
adrenaline we uh we find novelty threatening and so then we need an explanation
right if if you're subject to overthinking or you know someone who is in the face of novelty we want
those of us with this i'm not claiming i have it but um
lots of my unusually minded friends probably do
when when faced with novelty we experience fight or flight ish
fight flight freeze stuff and um the three f's
and then we form we may be inclined to form elaborate very elaborate explanatory frameworks my
my friend ms f may find this interesting given her work with neurodivergent people
who are among my favorite people to befriend and
hang out with if you happen to be one of those welcome to the clan welcome just want to say hello
so glad to have you here yeah beautiful love it fantastic
uh i'm gonna just make another little nod here um
i got you know some about about two months ago i worked really hard on an essay which i'm gonna be
expanding over time or may write a second one about the
uh unique prodigy genius
um
the the the mantic and the mantic manis manis thigh
amen hillman and there's some deep mysteries with this guy no doubt about it deep mysteries i'm
hoping to delve into some of those soon but i wrote this essay called amen hillman is unstoppable
and a few nights ago i got a message from my friend tim
in the uk with a link to a video because he and i have been talking since i discovered
amen we discovered amen about the same time actually
uh without in without telling each other
and we wrote back and forth like hey have you seen this guy and um he's become quite a phenomenon
yeah i got a message from my friend tim with just a link to one of amon's videos i think it's called
hebrew etymology
and when i watched it uh you know i worked really hard on this essay a couple months ago
called amon hillman is unstoppable and um see how my friend sent me a link in the beginning of
amon's video he sings the praises of my essay very very beautifully and kindly and generously and
passionately which is precisely what i was hoping might happen
uh and he particularly points out what i have to say
about his muse which is fundamentally crucial to his entire endeavor so yeah that was a very
exciting moment a lot of celebration among me and my friends around that and hopefully i'll be
doing an interview with amon very soon which i'm super excited about that's going to be so much fun
i'm hoping to do two or three actually we'll see what happens you know amon is somebody who has a
mission right and he's looking for people he's not exactly actively recruiting but it's not dissimilar right he uh
he knows that something is afoot
he knows that our world is right on the verge of change and the reason that he knows that
is
having read a lot of old greek text
he recognizes
the portents
literally the portents
the portents
and he can smell
he can smell the scent
on the tide of time
and he knows
that in our time
we will probably most of us are going to live long enough
to see our world cast into chaos
probably war
hopefully not war
because frankly
i don't
i love the humans i think they're amazing and beautiful
i'm i'm an anthropophile as i've said many times
i can't stand what the species does at the species register i think we're completely captured by
bullshit and
lethal problems with representational cognition
and just to be clear about why i think that happened really briefly
i think it happened when
the companions our minds were meant to symbiose with disappeared
due to some catastrophes
probably terrestrially and also
temporally
in terms of the solar family changes in the sun changes in
the planetary system changes in the milieu through which the sun
pulls the solar system over time
all these things
and possibly some things that i haven't named here but
what happened when when those
anciently conserved relationships disappeared
is i think two things happened
one
is
we went insane
and started becoming
primitively representational right
howdy
collapsing relationships into tokens and trading them which is going to
devastate everything that's beautiful and true and good
and i think the other side might have gone insane too i think the angels might have
you know
been miserable without bodies and avatars with which to experience physical reality i think
both sides of the family had problems and one of the most intriguing
possibilities is that what we think of as ufos
could be the
you know we became technological and started building machines they became meta-technological
and started building ways to embody themselves having never previously been
embodied except through us and other animals and other ecologies and perhaps other living worlds right
imagine the difference we build machines they build beings
right down here suffering and on with no way to understand why our companions for whom
that we are like um they are like the water to the fish of our minds they're like the living water
to the fish of our minds and we are like the fish
to the living water of their minds right and so when these two are divided by something
an array of catastrophes possibly a war i like not to think that but
we're divided then both of us start developing in a weird direction that we didn't previously have
to develop because we were together and we could provide to each other
the uh
the missing necessities
you know what it is yeah can't see any bones in this one though it's it's old that one's old i mean
i think it's old it's all fur there's no bone that's uncommon um so yeah like uh
imagine that um parents can no longer have children and children can no longer have parents
but the parents still exist and the children still exist and so the children try to invent parents
which let's just call that artificial intelligence and the parents try to invent children let's just
call those aliens you see where i'm going here how crazy amazing this idea is this is the kind of
thought we need to pursue together if we're going to try to understand what it can mean to be human
and what's going on in our universe especially around this planet especially right now at our time
in history what an astonishing idea the parents having been deprived of children start making
ufos filled with chilled child looking like weird you know the children of angels so to speak
and the humans start trying to invent gods
right which look like missiles and wheels that spin and uh gears and artificial intelligence and
things like this yeah but the humans also go insane and start having war in any case amin can tell
that bad things are coming on the on the near-term horizon and he knows what happens what the humans
usually do when this happens tyrants rise tyrant killers rise
the the fragrance of apocalypse gets into the nostrils of the people and they start acting kind of
crazy you can see evidence of this very clearly in what's going on in the middle east
um in the soviet union and ukraine and china and philippines north and south korea um you know you pick any
i mean spin the dial as far as the united states is concerned the weird problem with the united states
is we're like the petri dish for psyops for the rest of the world so what's going on here is
we're attacking ourselves right we don't we don't i'm sure we've got some external enemies that we're
pointing the guns at and stuff right like we've got um we've got ships dealing with uh
trouble from the syrian uh gosh i can't remember the syrian no it's maybe not from syria it's
some naval some naval some naval going on down in in um one of the gulfs i think we've got some ships
over there and you know our ships are ready to deal with uh i guess our ships i mean i don't even know
what i'm talking about um ships from the american navy are also in the uh in the area of the middle east
in case for example iran attacks israel all you can see right the the pot is bubbling all over the
place the little bubbles of apocalypse are bubbling up everywhere and since one of the um topics that
i'm orbiting here in this walk and talk is impossible missions what you can see right now is that the
humans under certain circumstances they get spun up and they go looking for a tyrant
or a messiah or a tyrant killer to organize them into a unit that then acquires the capacity for
heroism unfortunately this usually gets counterfeited and sold back to the humans
humans they get captured by some kind of stupidity um or rageful ignoramus that uh
you know i could name a couple of them floating around right now netanyahu trump putin
whoever's running china definitely whoever's running uh north korea
uh um forgive me if i've left out your favorite hated tyrannical idiot um or you know have picked one
of the opposite side than the ones you like to pick but yeah anyway the point is um under these
circumstances bad things you know the portents point toward not just an apocalypse but a cascade of
apocalyptic um rivulets that soon become a creek and then a stream and then a river
so what i'm suggesting instead is something a bit i think more interesting that we form small
tightly knit groups of highly creative and intelligent people we go around having the adventures we were
born to have together rescuing each other solving problems in our world um pulling down the ramparts
of tyranny and commercial domination that currently prevail over our lives futures history and children
pull that stuff down gently most of the time probably don't need bombs and guns
we can just do something so beautiful and amazing that nobody wants to be left out and we can do that in
small tightly knit groups that we can form improvisationally on the spur of the moment you can form
enact the mission and disperse and then reform a new group enact the mission and disperse nature
does this all day long this is where i learned this protocol from just from watching how nature deals with
the mission and disperse nature with danger tyrants catastrophe disaster she's brilliant at this just
brilliant she makes little tightly knit groups of perfectly performing
heroes overcomes the problem and then disperses and when she disperses the reproductive
seeds of future missions go flying into the wind like the seeds of the dandelion and those seeds land in human
hearts and cause them to take up
acts of great beauty intelligence integrity honesty and emotional
coherence
the opposite of what we do in war what is the opposite of of a bomb people let's form one and find out
i've had enough bombs the first bomb i ever saw go off was one too many in my life
the first time i ever saw a gun
fire a bullet was one too many times the first time i saw science dissect a living creature was one
too many times
there's a future for us that's very different from what we've been living and imagining
and it's within our grasp but nobody's going to bring it to us on you know in a shopping cart
it's not going to come from amazon folks we've got to step up to the table together with noble intention
with the orientation to understand and become what virtue really means together for each other
and the history and future of life on this world
you know every one of our ancestors dreamt that we would do this every one of our children asks this of us
that don't ask us to be republicans or democrats or join an army what they're asking for is liberation
a return to the possibilities of our human potentials
the chance to explore and enact and embody those potentials together in a way that we would all be
proud of in a way that would make the sun proud the moon proud the planet would would be
crying with joy if the humans could just inch toward virtue together instead of defecting at the
at the species register in every possible way and then keep just like keep inventing new ways to defect
per moment via social media or computation or weapons development or you know you name it
i'm hoping that it won't come to war and the main reason i'm hoping it is as i was saying earlier i'm
an anthropophile i love the humans i know i know they are like children who have been um enslaved right it's
a it's a reverse pinocchio problem right in pinocchio a puppet wants to become a real boy but our problem is
that we've been puppeteered we are real um children but we've been turned into marionettes by forces we
don't understand the origin or nature of and most of us will not have a chance to achieve those
understandings in our lifetime unless someone comes who can bring us keys
i have an unfinished essay that those of you who like this idea might might find interesting called
um the potemkin village and the reverse pinocchio gambit a potemkin village is a place where you um
you basically build an empty village and you move people in and then you just frack them
right facebook much internet much google much twitter much instagram much pinterest much tick tock much
temu much amazon much you see we're surrounded we're not we're not living in one potemkin village
potemkin villages are invading our lives in new forms every few months and re-fracking the remnants of
what the last villages didn't manage to compromise yet we can't continue this way folks we got to do
something other than this please so i hope it won't be war for a lot of reasons people saying like i
know i've heard some people say there's too many humans okay well i don't know how many humans is too
many i really don't i'm not sure but what i do know are two things that are relatively simple one the
amount of devastation we have to level to the remnants of the anciently conserved ecologies
the air the soil the oceans the forests the living beings animals
the sky our ancestors our children the amount of damage that we have to do
to keep a city like mine running for 30 minutes is unimaginable and it's growing exponentially
that can't go on right and so the humans aren't going to stop doing that i mean i can't imagine
them stopping something's going to have to stop them from doing that and the earth will eventually
stop them it just takes her a while to notice things because for her a minute is you know like
400 000 years so the humans have been misbehaving for like a tenth of a second
but the damage they've done is unimaginable she's going to put the kibosh on that folks one way or
another and she'd probably use the humans to do it right you don't have to think that the earth is a
person but there's no way she's not a more than merely intelligent hyper structure of relationships
anciently conserved she will act to protect her own well-being and i promise you something else she has
friends just friends just like you do just like i do companions in time space intelligences other
planets other stars things we don't even have categories for and if she says ow those things come running
so the humans are about to undergo a series of very rude awakenings
things in my perspective um i don't want them to be punished but we can't keep doing the city thing
and the war thing and the you know um commercial economy thing that's just not going to fly anymore
folks that's that stuff's going to get torn down one way or another it doesn't matter if there are
gods or if the earth's intelligent if if not we'll tear it down ourselves so there's that but i actually
care about the anciently conserved ecologies and war is too expensive for them so you know we need
something we need an answer other than you know nuclear war or uh bioweapons and things and the other
thing i know is there's too many fucking objects i'm not sure how many humans is too many but it's
blatantly obvious to me that uh the number of ketchup packets that's too many is a hundred the number of
cars that's too many is a thousand same with ships and all those things right all those things that destroy
the ecologies in order to sustain what we call a way of life but it's actually a way of death
and i know um brilliant minds like derek jensen would agree with me even though i
rather accidentally long ago offended him and his folks but yeah that's that's someone who i really
respect and admire the work of and i strongly encourage those of you who have not encountered
his work to read a language older than words which is a very important book for me
and also his books on the prison system which is something i despise and think is just a standing
atrocity so you know it's my hope that and i'm going to try and make this happen i'm not just going
to be all talk it's my hope that we will find a way to assemble small highly motivated creative groups of
humans um who will train themselves on easily accomplished missions at first um to prepare for
the possibility of missions that approach the impossible in the future i really like the um tactic
suggested by uh god who is that guy he probably didn't invent it either he's a super tony robbins
right um i remember joe mcmonegal uh remote viewer 001 for the united states government as far as i know
talking about um having figured out how to train marksmen really quickly you start out by putting the
the bullseye right at the end of the pistol and and so they succeed every time they pull the trigger and
then you just keep moving it farther away instead of starting with something that's really hard you
start with something that's really easy and then you just um walk toward skillfulness piecemeal
and you can train humans much faster this way we've got xcia agents we have manuals
we can learn how to capture and restructure representational contexts
like instantaneously improvisationally playfully for the purposes that actually matter instead of for
the purposes of devastating the past the future ourselves each other and our potentials and that's
the direction which we're going to go in the question for sure like there's no no two ways about it
the question is will we go um will we go in with inspiration and creatively while we are still
while we still have great liberty and luxury or will we be forced in that direction by absolute disaster
catastrophe and death i'd prefer the first one myself i'm pretty sure you would too
so let's start walking in that direction together to whatever degree we feel comfortable with each
other and you know let's push the boundary of our comfort as well we're not here to sustain the
safety and the comfort of a life unlived and die in our boxes like hamsters
perhaps a life is actually something
that we came here to give away to causes that are noble and true and brilliant
and that principle is what gets captured by milit by the military sports teams religion ideology
war commerce corporations
if i may be so blunt fuck those things it's time to put the end to that crap and actually be human
together with and for each other and the history and future of all beings and particularly those
beings local to this world that i adore and was born on
i'm really grateful to have this time together
i wish you all a beautiful moment forgive me if i've been a little bit uh
it's the right word if i've been um soap boxing a little bit here but i think these are worthy
uh worthy inspirations and motivations and orientations to pursue remind each other of
to join and elaborate and maybe even do a little recruitment here together you know find three people
four people four people um create a uh
create a little pot of humans
and
i suggest an odd number three five seven select an easily achievable mission carry it out debrief learn
what you can learn develop fix the mistakes go again
crib tactics from intelligence agents green berets ballerinas brilliant science fiction authors
make a circle of teachers of six different kinds and create a lens
that unifies those intelligences and allows you to
to harvest the potentials and methods and insights and motivations
the heroism
bring that into your bodies into your relationships into your life into your behavior
into your motivations let's become human again together
i wish you a beautiful way may your dreams lives and relationships be amazing
