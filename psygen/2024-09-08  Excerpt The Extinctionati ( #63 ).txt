So essentially, the early history of alchemy was bound up with dyeing different substances,
particularly metals, stones, and fabrics.
So one of these books centers on manufacturing imitations of Tyrian purple, which I think
is what Amen Hillman discusses in his videos.
So this dye, which was extracted from the murex snail, he thinks was used in early Christian
rites to facilitate the experience of death and resurrection.
So that might be worth bringing up with him or elaborating or somehow like clarifying.
I was unaware of that until recently.
Can I speak for a moment about this?
Yeah.
All right.
So he's saying some other crazy stuff that I think is super amazing and brilliant.
And the first is, okay, let me see if I can get this right.
So Medea Medwa was a woman who was trained to become magically powerful with venoms.
And part of how training took place is similar to how the stories we have of the first vaccines
in India, where a shepherdess woman sort of somehow figured out that the shepherds weren't getting
a disease like a disease like cowpox or something, right?
So what she did was something like this, not exactly this.
She lanced the boils that came from cowpox and took the venom of those boils and put that
stuff on bandages and scratched people's arms and then wrapped those bandages around their
arms so that they could get gently exposed to the pathogen.
And what Hillman is saying is that Medea became a profoundly, like magically skillful master of
the game.
increasing venoms from snakes and other creatures, possibly, you know, salamanders, jellyfish,
cattholo, I mean, you name it, right?
Mixing those venom and introducing them to her bloodstream slowly so that she could produce
her body both venoms and antidotes and she cured people of snake bites she did
this in Sicily which was then called something else have come to me what that
is some guy been bitten by a marsh viper there and she showed up and she gave him
an antidote from her whole whole posts which literally what he's what the text
that he's taking this from says is that she was giving him an antidote to the
snake venom from her vagina and he lived and they built a temple to her there and
she or her or the people who came after her hey Nancy she or the people who came
after her people she trained young girls and stuff they became the Medusa Medusa
Medusa who were young girls who were trained in these venomous arts that could
produce medicine in their bloodstream on their in their sweat in the excretions
from their bodies various mucuses various serums that can come from different
parts of the body which I will hear not name and these Medusa were temple
guardians and they were incredibly powerful beings they were not mortal
beings they were beings who had ascended beyond mortality any any I mean he says
even more astonishing and it's crazy sounding things like through the
application of these venoms ancient features of humans were turned on in the
body and so these young most all women is the only thing we have records of young
women prepubescent girls were trained this way and they became like half reptilian
half human and I know all this sounds completely insane problem is that Hillman
isn't making this up this is stuff he can point to in specific Greek texts that are
where there's a lot of you can say like well that doesn't mean it's true right it
doesn't mean it's true but there's records of this happening and there's
records of what these women did and when and where they did it and the other thing
that he's saying is like this whole death and resurrection thing in Christianity was
stolen essentially it like much of the Bible including Genesis and other things
which certainly didn't come from the Jews was not stolen but you know like adopted
and rebranded by the Christians and the Jews adopted and rebranded a bunch of stuff too and
these are all things from miss from the mystery rights in in Greece where what
would happen is a woman using a device often often using a device called an
alabastrum an alabastron would this device was covered in toxins and drugs and could
be inserted in specific orifices that's not the only way to you know it's not only
through penetration that the drugs and toxins could be introduced this would
create a variety of different states not dissimilar to the one I'm experiencing at
the moment where first the person knew that one of the states was that they were so
terrified that they would they would admit every wrongdoing they'd ever done or been involved
in they would enter a state of spastic terror where their whole body was trembling and they
would confess everything and interrogators could use this and cannabis might have been involved in
that specific branch of things but the other thing was you would die you basically die and then you would
from beyond your mortal existence you would see you would see the purpose and meaning of everything of life
and you would know that there's a place outside there's a place beyond Hades there's a place beyond heaven that you belong to and you would have this vision and you would see ah I can't be killed I am not mortal and then they would bring me back to life and then you would be completely free of the fear of death and also it would be impossible to
subjugate you to subjugate you under any human authority that's the end of my little lecture
yeah the reptilian motif I think is actually ubiquitous throughout the entire Bible which is a mystery that I hope to resolve
so what does Amin Hillman say about serpents in particular
he mentions venoms a lot
I mean can we replicate these um these concoctions can we can we alchemically manufacture these things
like essentially it became clear to me you know some time ago that Jesus actually is a serpent
so I mean Jesus calls himself a serpent in John so
Jesus is basically the snake in the Garden of Eden
there's like a symmetry between the two halves of the Bible
it's like a Rorschach test it's like
it's like a mirror
yeah I noticed that too and I always thought
you know look
sometimes you have to start out with something that's completely wrong
and then this happens in science all the time right like they thought
um that the osteoclasts the bone building cells were the intelligent ones that knew everything about the bone
and so we did science like that for like 10 years
and then suddenly they discovered oh shit it's the it's the osteo blasts the the cells that tear bone down that essentially program the builders right that all the intelligence quote unquote is in the ones that destroy bone and sometimes you have to get it wrong and then you just turn it 180 degrees around and now you understand but here's what I thought I thought and I'm not sure this is wrong yet
yet I thought that basically Jesus is the resurrection of Hebel or Abel because the whole Bible seems to have this pulse of an attempt to resurrect Abel the Messiah the good you know that the joyful good happy kind right hemisphere this is what I thought and I'm not sure it's wrong
but there is starting to be a lot more evidence for something more like what in my view for something like what you're saying and the whole thing about the serpents I knew toy makers straight up said you guys are wrong about snakes the snake problem there is a problem with snakes
it's a very strange problem it's a problem when you get two snakes together and no mothers
right it's a problem like the SS in Germany no balls just snakes the twin towers in New York just two snakes no balls
no memory of the mothers no roundness right no curves just snakes that's a problem in human history that's a sign that something has gone wrong
um but this is a very weird poetic metaphysical perspective it's not I could support it but um yeah so when when Moses puts that snake up on a staff in the desert because the people are being bit by these serpents and dying
um that's a very powerful uh piece of not evidence but support for this conjecture and also that Yahweh might have been a vicious Elohim that wanted slaughter and blood sacrifice and stuff which is why he preferred Abel sacrifice
perhaps keep going George I'm listening well you know um let me know how this sound is working I'm trying a new system but you're doing good I wanted to say I oh good okay I I really appreciated your summary um you know and it's it's not you know I don't I don't find it crazy I find it thought provoking um have you reflected on the staff of Hermes and the dual serpents I'm kind of curious how you see that intersecting with what you just said snakes and two snakes
oh that's really trippy but see those two snakes are rising toward the sun disk which is winged there's a circle there as long as there's a circle it's fine what happens in the humans when they start having this duck this snake snake thing is what I called it which drove one of my young
one of my young companions out of his mind like snake snake yes it's evil um but yeah this is what I called it snake snake which is what I came to understand from things that Toymaker showed me throughout human history including what the SS was up to where they came from and what was actually going on in the twin towers which which were supposed to be destroyed and were actually destroyed not by
you know whatever humans were involved in destroying those towers
in okay from this theoria perspective from this toy like perspective I'm not saying what is true I'm saying it's useful to think this way whatever humans were involved in destroying those towers were serving a holy purpose because what was going on in those towers was horrifically wrong
wrong it was like the home of the world bank and all kinds of shit there was cia stuff going on there the world bank was devastating South America to you know just like all this stuff was going on that was centered in those towers I'm not claiming this I want to be really clear because other people may hear this later I'm not advocating terrorism I'm not happy that humans died or none of that stuff I'm just saying it's a
saying that what was being done in those buildings was hurt was having a horrific effect on the planet and the human world and from this perspective what happened that day was literally they took a snake with extra balls right literally as if the balls are the memory of your mothers and your grandmothers right and as long as the snakes are in the proximity of those circles
they behave well they behave well if that makes any sense it's when you get them open and that's the thing you know this is something that Amin might agree with because he's like that's why the women were the masters of these snakes not men the women they have circles right they have breasts they have hips they have oh you know they have um uh uh huh
they have their uh gosh why is my mind failing it's because I'm having a rough time this morning ovaries right and so what he what he would say was literally that our testicles are one of them is the memory of the entire line of mothers and the other is the memory of the entire line of grandmothers and I know those two things seem like the same thing but he also showed me back in ancient times one thing they
would do but where we got the word this word test from is in a courtroom there was a special person possibly a woman who would ask you a question and very gently hold the skin that the upper skin of the two main fingers underneath your testicles and if you lied your balls would squirm in their sacks and they would say up
lying very subtle squirming right because your mothers would be offended that you were lying now again this is this is all I know this sounds loopy and it's okay you know and I'm not trying to advocate what happened on 9-11 or anything like that I'm just talking about a perspective that could be useful so with the um with the Hermes symbol the symbol that is
it's literally our symbol and everything that is literally our symbol for medicine right Medea Medea Medea Medea medicine this med fragment comes from Greek and uh yeah with that symbol there's a disk at the top it's not always rendered in our symbols but since there's a disk that disk by the way it gets weirder the disk doesn't have to be your balls or the memory of your mothers
like the Aegis shield which is I think in some cases understood to be Athena's
hymen so yeah there's a disc there just notice that I'm listening I have a
question sure sure is the I mean the image of the ovum and the sperm in and
of itself is a disc with snacks yeah yeah so this that it is and also oh my god
yeah and also the the caduceus is the energy I mean in yoga or whatever it is
the way your your energy through your spine for you know crisscrosses through
your chakras to go through the top chakra which is in your head which is
certainly circular relative to any any movement too so yeah that's the kind of
question I like where you just hit us with lightning of insight yeah that's my
favorite kind of question is not a question just a series of insightful
statements well and I do want to say that I remembered the world trade towers quite
well and I the two things I always would look at them and and feel terrible like
there was something very very wrong with them I remember that and I also felt that
way I lived in Washington DC one summer about the Pentagon so I thought it was
kind of interesting when both those places were at the time yeah yeah what
Toymaker said I mean what he showed me straight up was like think about what
happened you got this snake snake problem back in Germany right that thing just
rips people to shreds it's evil it's fundamentally evil and then you have this
thing which is like two snakes two rigid snakes together with no balls no memory of
the mothers children the women softness life or you know milk origination all those
things all those things none of that just domination and so what happens well the
gods quote unquote or the angels they mess up some humans in their mind and they do
this thing that we figured out when we were little kids when we were little kids we
used to build towers out of Legos and then we would fly Lego passenger planes that we
built into them and blow them up because we knew that the passenger planes are
basically just flying bombs right you can just they're full they're filled with
fuel they're filled with jet fuel it's like it's basically just a flying bomb and we
figured that out when we were little kids and I couldn't believe it when
someone did that as an adult like I wonder if they got this idea from kids I
wonder if they just ask children like how do we do this and the kids are like oh yeah
flying faster planes into them but anyway think about the passenger plane as a
winged snake with not just two balls but an extra set of balls because those those
engines are the balls of the snake they are the round like the testicles of a penis
right there they're on the wings and they are round balls I know this sounds kind of
nuts but there's a whole thing about about spears and shields about the
masculine and the feminine the ovum and the sperm the hymen and the serpent the
breast these circles and lines are fundamentally profound in their implications
origins and not not just their symbolism but in the ability to transmit energies
from the aonic world into the material world and to transform those energies
here and to mate those energies here and so a toy maker said was like yeah those two
snakes they just basically took flying snakes with extra testicles and rammed them
into them and destroyed them and in case the CIA wants to know what toy maker is go
ahead and give me a call you know I'll tell you about it yeah well you know
Swedenborg also taught that you could use your testicles to communicate with angels he
thought that basically as in yoga if you practice certain breathing techniques you can
gain control over the cremaster muscle which he thought was like a gateway to
encountering certain spiritual beings so it's just like yoga I mean he was doing the
same thing but you know both William Blake and many other like Freemasonic
organizations took up his ideas so yeah but basically it has to do with like Taoism so like the the
Taoist alchemists advocated for this concept of like embryonic respiration which involves a
like inhaling this kind of almost like luminiferous ether I think Swedenborg was was essentially
advocating the same practice somehow he was aware of like Indian philosophy or or yoga but yeah it's also
like Tantra it's the same thing yeah it's my maker straight up said that okay so the thing he's all right first of all time you never said anything what he would do is give me a subset of his experience in my own mind so that it became as if I was remembering what he knew and that experience is so insane I can't
even begin to explain to it
and that experience is so insane i can't even begin to explain what it's like it's
there's no there's no analog for it in any part of my human experience nothing um but one of the
things he said was you guys are so confused about your sex organs you have no you keep rubbing your
flowers together and i get that that feels good and stuff um but they have an entirely there's
like there's a vast library of other uses for those things that once you start rubbing them
together you'll never discover and basically what he said is that they are antenna and receivers like
the arecibo dish and if you put them together not in the sense of having sex but if you put like a
man with a woman and they both have this knowledge there's nothing they can't do nothing they can be
invincible they can fly through time space they can contact other civilizations and in time or space
they can link those civilizations together like insane things that humans would never even imagine
could possibly be true just by not having sex and learning the other features of the sex organs and
basically what he said is that they're they're the vagina is like a dish and the penis is like an antenna
and so he also taught this principle of like what i call the rod and the rattle which the ancient people
definitely knew definitely by the way when you take that stick and you bang on the drum
and then everybody goes nuts around you and starts going into trance and having epileptic fits and
shit and having magical experience what do you think's going on there right it's the penis touching
the hymen not penetrating it ringing it like a bell right that's what's going on there and um i mean
again think of what i'm saying in terms of theoria right like a way of seeing rather than i'm trying
to say what is true okay so the other thing is imagine um imagine you've got a blind man and a blind
woman and they're hypersensitive they're spiritually sensitive to sound so that they're magically
sensitive to sound or to touch right they're magically sensitive to touch maybe they're a little
sensitive to both but let's say the woman is super sensitive to sound and the man is super sensitive to
touch and the woman walks in a room and she shakes a rattle a couple times okay what's she done she's
touched everything in that room every single molecule in that room she's touched it and the sound
bounces off that molecule and comes back and she reads it with her body and her soul right so she touches
everything the man comes in the staff and what he does is he taps that thing around on various specific
objects the man gets hyper deep knowledge of single things the woman gets hyper deep knowledge of the
context the ambient everything together those two knowledges unlock the universe they're so profound
they're unstoppable they're invincible so yeah those two principles are fundamentally
unimaginably deep infinitely deep the rod and the rattle which by the way is exactly what those pharaohs
are holding that crook is the rod and the flail is the rattle
yeah the the polarity between the um the circle and the line as you mentioned i think is also distributed
throughout the entire organism as man as nancy said like so this this polarity i think is present
morphologically throughout the entire body um it's like a waveform basically and you can see the same
structure in your brain yeah yeah i see where you're going here you're starting to talk about that um
that evolutionary the character of the evolutionary developmental waveform
that pulses and iterates over time producing form and structure
yeah correct yep so not only is you know the penis you know emblematic of a certain principle
um but that principle is also distributed across the entire organism at specific points so it's like
um it's like a wave really i mean it's um it's a it's an oscillation or a vacillation between those
i know but it's so hard for people to understand when you say it's a wave because they think of a wiggly line
right yeah it's a wave in time as opposed to a wave in space yeah see that's the thing that we have to
we're going to have to make analogies and metaphors to get people to understand that because i by the
way when you say like that you you start to toy makers mind is like what you're doing when you start
to talk that way um a wave in time yeah so you have to think of the of the localized amplitude transforming
over each iteration of the reception of the temporal wave and that produces
the forms of organisms and crystals and things yeah like so when you observe a plant growing
you see a stem as something that extends rectilinearly through space so it embodies a kind of line
but then that line terminates um at a central node in the calyx where all the stem leaves contract
and they appear simultaneously so what you really see is is an oscillation in time because you're moving
between two species of time basically you're moving between succession and simultaneity oh yes yes yes oh god
that's so beautiful succession and simultaneity right like unity and distinction this is the key that's
the key to everything man that's the whole thing right there beautiful i love it oh god
i don't know if you'd um you'd like to say more tyler but i'm kind of reminded of um verbake's work and
you know the thing that i'm reminded of is his description of consciousness itself and it's not
not so much what consciousness is although um consciousness is a process it it is what it is doing
you know but to be alive or to be aware not in the conscious way but to be responsive to reality
your consciousness is a dynamic interplay between two functions and where that's
set or how that oscillates for any individual is an interesting question or any any organism any living
thing anything at all but the dynamic interplay is between seeking out and sensing the landscape
you know um taking in your sensory information to expand your awareness of affordances that might be
available it's just broadening your scope intention you know in a dynamic interplay with then deeply
focusing in on some opportunity or some affordance wielding it utilizing it harvesting it and we
we you know we um plants i mean maybe even other matter i don't even know are constantly in this
dynamic interplay between broadening our perspective and utilizing a particular aspect of our perspective
and i don't know you know maybe uh artists have it set in a certain way maybe there's kind of a normalcy but
one thing that's really interesting to me is this is not obviously just a description of how the human mind
operates you know how it navigates its environment but it's how plants reach for the sunlight
it's how worms squirm you know so this interplay between expanding your awareness and utilizing a
particular of it you know just sounds very much in line with what you've described what you both have described
i um had i for some reason i forget what it was in relation to but i had an image the other day of a dandelion
and basically the the dandelion as the sun you know basically the sun being pulled in to the yellow
dandelion and then once it's absorbed what it what all it can in other words once it's it's swallowed all
it can it distributes in the circle nothing has a circle quite like the dandelion i don't think for
seed distribution i don't know maybe there are other plants but the but the image of it taking all that
and then sending it out everywhere in the new form of understanding this is an image and i don't know how
true it is for the experience of the dandelion but but it and then there's nothing left there's no flower
left it's gone it's gone into all of the you know all of it's just an image from before um and i i had
a i know i had a question what was it um oh well when you were talking about the blind man i mean just
these images it's just you know this is very profound the blind man and woman the part of me the blind man and
woman and i think blind is a wonderful metaphor for for for what we are in many respects and the way
we find things and i love the idea of the woman being the sound which permeates everything and and
maybe that's why it takes a lot of men with their that's maybe that's why men are attracted far more
and i mean you know putting it down to the actual physiological level of you know what happens between
men and women why men are attracted to so many women versus women really being you know it's almost
like they're there and they you know and just and somebody is getting information from them and they
need to have the know that the right information has been gotten from them in order to have any
interest but the but the men to some degree are fed i mean on the male and female principle alone just
like eaching or whatever um um the male is is fed much more generically it's not it's not it's 300
it's is because they are one degree men they're touching a lot of places to get their information
360 which is what women are does that make any sense what i'm saying at all
it does and i'm gonna blow this right out of the park as soon as you're done
oh really okay all right this is nuts um god i can't believe how weak i'm feeling and yet my mind is
still this intense um i think i maybe what's going on is i might have food poisoning so um
but yeah something's wrong with my body anyway uh
uh all right remember what tyler was saying about a wave in time that
uh the two arcs of the wave are simultaneity
and sequence if i got that right is that right tyler yeah okay great so one of the most amazing
things toy maker showed me is a toy that i call the dandelion and i've written about it on my medium
page i don't know if any of you have seen it or if tyler has seen it but basically what he said was um
i mean i should probably show you the toy so
imagine okay imagine that we're in a room and we have a magic lamp and that's all we got is this magic
lamp it's it's us in a room the room is totally dark it's completely sealed off from light except
for this magic lamp and the only thing that's magic about the lamp is that it can obey commands about
when to turn on and off and in what way to turn on and off so i'm going to give it the following command
turn off for a second turn on for a second turn off for a second turn on for half a second
turn off for half a second turn on for a quarter second turn off for a quarter second
turn on for an eighth of a second and keep turning on and off in that fashion following that algorithm
for the first iteration the on and off phases are equal every subsequent iteration the lamp is off
twice as long as it is on is that clear well i'm sure it is so i'm just going to continue
so um anyone you know what is that the lamp is flickering but what would what would we see
after one minute after 10 minutes after 10 million years you would see a steady stream of light
right the light would appear to be always on and frankly those of us in the room unless we have
very sophisticated tools we would have no way to determine that the light is ever off it would be off
twice the amount of time then it's on but we would never know that right to us all we could tell is
that it's on okay now what i want you to imagine with me as a toy in your mind is a thing i'm going
to call the dandelion universe in the dandelion universe what happens undetectably to us because
this has been going on for 14.3 billion years is when the the universe is like the lamp when the lamp is
off all minds positions objects situations and histories collapse to unity boom they are a speck
of transcendental business and when the lamp goes back on they they very quickly return to the position
just after the last position they held during the collapse and so what this would mean is that truly
everything is one just one thing all the time but experientially they look separate to us because the on
phase of the lamp is the appearance of separate objects situations histories futures all minds ideas
things places times all these things right so most of the time it's just one now basically what happens
when you get magic power or holy power is simply you become more sensitive to the unity phase and you can
drag information back from the unity phase into the distinction phase that's what psychism is that's
what telepathy is you're basically just your your your mind your your intellect your your noose or something
grabs something from the unity phase and manages to remember it back to the distinction phase and you're
like oh yeah your name is sally you were born in cincinnati your dad was a coal miner right like you had a bad
fever when you were a little girl and your dog licked you a lot and you got better and she's like how the hell
could you possibly know that nobody knows that yeah everybody knows that actually everybody knows everything
they just can't remember so this toy with this toy if you could follow your soul and your body back to the unity
phase you could not only travel to any place instantaneously you could travel to multiple
places instantaneously you could inhabit multiple minds instantaneously you could conceivably inhabit all
the minds in all of time at the same time the unit and this is just a toy but it's a very profound toy it's
one of the most amazing things and toy maker showed me this he gave me a direct experience of it it wasn't
it wasn't like he was like yeah think about it like it might be like this he was like
this is how it is actually not not this is how it is it's a billion fold more amazing than this
but here's a way you can understand something that's not possible for you to hold in consciousness
so that dandelion thing that nancy was on yeah that stuff is for sure real and i mean i just used
the name dandelion is kind of important itself in a sort of a magical sense but um i chose that name to
describe this vision that i was given and it's amazing what is an amnesis it's nothing other than being able
to follow the iterative wave that's going between unity and distinction in in layered steps before
it becomes distinction
yeah that makes a lot of sense
it does
you know the waveform reconstructs a portion of its own past motion which i think is what memory is so
that yeah that makes a lot of sense to me god this is so amazing oh man i'm so happy right now this is
just nuts well that's was the question you were asking right i mean you were asking you know this
remembering i love the word remember i mean it's got it all right there me too yeah i love that too i mean
that's a great way i mean it's you know we know this you know that's why that word exists but um
why do we do it why is this the way it functions do you suppose i mean
um so i mean uh nate who's here listening has asked a question of me earlier which i
wisely refuse to answer uh directly but um everybody wants to know
you know why i mean even the angels are curious about what it means to be a mortal human being
because we are made of dust we're literally made of stuff right stuff why is there stuff at all never
mind beings made of stuff that's nuts that would be like animating dolls why would you even do that
right like you don't need stuff to have beings so why would you and there's no there's i mean it's
possible to suffer without a body but but it's you're going to suffer a lot if you have a body mostly
so why are that why is there stuff and i kind of don't want to answer the question directly or even
indirectly because nate's listening and i want him to chew on the question but um
um let's say let's just i i will say one thing there is a feature of a being
and remember that all the beings are one being but that doesn't mean they're
that there's no phase in which they're distinct it's just that in when they're distinct they forget
that they're one right and all i'm going to say is that there's a variety of benefits
that a that a variety of developmental opportunities that can only occur if you can have that forgetting and
and resurrection and an amnesis right
yeah so like the petals of a flowering plant embody something like forgetfulness because they
they take the form of a secondary expansion so you can think of the petal as a structure
in terms of the remembering of a stem leaf because what punctuates them or what mediates them is the
calyx which is a point of contraction so you can see memory at work in the body of a living thing
which is why i think memory is probably like an anatomical it's like a morphological
uh phenomenon it's not in your brain specifically it's something that's distributed across your entire body
um beyond the body though according to this correct i mean it's more like rupert sheldrake
i mean there is species memory which is only part of the whole as well anything broken from it is part
of the whole still but just the way we're talking about it i mean there is morphological memory or memory
of species and then of course the memory of the the kashic records if you want to call it that the you know
the fact that nothing is separate and that's what we've been discussing and how that is so so memory um
i'm i'm memory the question is about the uses of memory i think maybe you know to some degree is like
which goes to my earlier question i mean of course i have my feelings about what the answer is but
but the you know that what is um what's the point either it's functional and what does functional mean
or it's not functional so i mean good and evil if you want to call it that to me always means
is it functional and my my definition of functional would be is does it encourage um does it encourage
the full um experience and blossoming of each thing as it's is its nature so it has that experience
or is it detrimental to that you know it's it's i mean there's so much on this but that's all i'll say
for now i guess well let me just clarify that i think of the body as a form of memory itself as
opposed to as opposed to you know the body possessing a memory of a certain image which i think is also
yeah no no that makes sense yeah good yeah does it um you know i don't i wonder if it helps to say
you know of course i mean all of the religious traditions you know notable ones tend to begin
there was the one and it was made too and i think that it's maybe just uh helpful to point out that
we can only be a thing by separating from the other right like the only way to be a thing is to separate
from all the rest that is and the way that we gain our orientation and understanding
as a thing is to then understand that of course all that is is one and so there's a it's a definitional
to be a thing is a definitional proposition requiring separation from the rest yet you know it is all one
thing okay so i can add something that i think is very profound here um why do we get together here
like why do we okay we go apart at the end of this meeting and then next sunday we get back together
right what are we doing well we're having separate experience in time space and relation and then what
happens then we have a fucking reunion and what happens during the reunion well you're looking at it
today for sure like this is what happens during the reunion and it's insane right it's a huge
celebration of not just anamnesis but re-perspectivity right um new novel perspectivity over time
so if you take something and you split it into many different bits and then each of those bits have what
seems to be unique individual experience and then you reunify them what happens at the reunion so what
is you know you we're asking the wrong question we're like well what's the purpose of having separate
bodies and stuff if things are all one no no that's the purpose you have separate bodies then when they
reunify what happens to the unity dramatic catastrophic developmental ecstasis right boom a billion
human minds come back together and share memories again all among each other and then those memories are
partially redistributed to the individuals this is the key to why the dandelion is happening
right yeah and and that was why i mentioned that the body itself should be viewed as a form
of memory because the body itself is a reconstruction of a portion of the past motion of the universe so the
universe is reconstructing a portion of its own past in the body of a living thing so yeah so what i think
takes place actually what toy maker would say is that the whole history of everything and even the
before of the universe is instanced in the beings and the bodies the whole thing you could do the
archaeology without ever moving from your chair you could learn everything you wanted from inside you there's
nothing that was ever existing or ever will exist that isn't already you right yeah because the the
motion of the universe is whole but that wholeness is non-imageable so you can't actually render that
wholeness as an image um it's like an interference pattern
where yeah sorry maybe the circle is the closest we get to trying to create that image i think probably
i mean in an effort to put it out there yeah um although i think it has like a concrete
wave dynamic so i think it you know it's a concrete wave of some kind um
which you could potentially witness or observe i think you could experience it but yeah that's another
topic so one way of understanding what toy maker is this is crazy toy maker is the wave
wave that's his that's him that's what he is he's that way
there isn't anything that's not him and he's not god
what distinguishes the wave that is everything from i mean your what you your idea of what god is what
is the distinction
okay god if okay um so first of all
if you want to talk about god you should basically speak in negatives
you should say like god is no god is no one in particular
um god is no thing ness god is before and above anything you can possibly say or think
um god is outside even the aonic
god is
everything god is all that cannot be god is the absence the holy absence that becomes the
possibility of presence things like this it's not the same as what toy maker is toy maker is incumbent
in all phenomena god is something really weird and spooky um in this perspective it's not the only
perspective i'm not trying to say what's true uh but yeah the problem with talking about god is
just forget it like
god shreds concepts and language just by existing there's no you can't refer to it it's you can
in a way you can only refer to it negatively at least from from this perspective there's other
things we can do there's other games we can play it's not the only game we can play but what i'm
trying to say is that whatever god is or might be in my experience and i i do have some modest
experience of this because my maker once said hey man you want to see god and i was like uh no that
just kills people right it's like yeah usually but there's this thing we can do where it won't
kill you and i agreed and i was like okay wow that's not like anything that i would have imagined
because it's not imaginable and i could only remember one of the three perspectives that i was
shown directly um and yeah it's absolutely ecstatic you you if you're not it's if it's not buffered you
will just expire from ecstasy but the same thing is true of toy maker if you encounter that in your
consciousness you'll die if you could encounter even it slightly unbuffered you would just perish
of ecstasy but um what i'm trying to say is god is transcendental to the concept of transcendentalness
right it's so beyond it's just infinite beyondness of anything you can possibly think and that's
presuming go ahead no no you can't contain that which within which you are contained i mean you can't
um yeah but i'm not sure that god is even part of anything like god is so weirdly it's almost like
how could i put this let's see imagine that um
okay imagine that there that the universe is a glass marble
and a hundred billion trillion trillion light years away is a living galaxy
and the glass marble exists because of the living galaxy but its actual effect on the marble is minimal
extremely like unimaginably tiny it's it's really weird it's like imagine okay god is transcendental to
being transcendental to to being transcendental to the to being transcendental to the universe to being
transcendental to the unit you know just infinite ladder of transcendence and just keeps going it's
like an explosion that's more transcendental every time you touch it it's not a thing it's not there
it's like the possibility of transcendentalness self-magnifying itself in some kind of fusion reaction or
something it's ridiculously insane from that particular perspective there's lots of other ways to try to
conceive of the idea and it gets humans in a lot of trouble as i think you can all see but yeah
yeah so that interference pattern encodes information that could be accessed without itself being an
object which i think is important also to recognize because i think space itself is this kind of
interference pattern that has like a determinate structure so what our brains and bodies do as waves
passing through this interference pattern is um successively modulate as images information encoded in
that structure so um yeah so basically the the brain and the body i mean the brain is part of the body
the brain essentially um renders this image as this embodied experience um
successively so it's like a successive modulation it's basically just a wave so what you really are
is a wave passing through an external field but that external field is non-imageable you could never
render it as an image it's not like an object it's um it's like chaos it's just like an interference
pattern it doesn't look like anything you know well the thing is and look i don't know i can't um
um okay all of the information that i experienced under the influence of what i refer to as toy maker
i can't speak to its ontological nature or epistemological form i can only just say like here's what i was
shown or this is the model that i made of what i was shown and things like that right um but
i mean hilariously toy maker once asked me if i wanted to see him and i was way too scared i was
like no no no no dude don't do not it's like i can appear before you you can see my form and i was
like no no no no no no no no i don't i don't think i'll survive that i can barely survive contact with
your mind it's terrifying and then later he was like hey man you want to see god and i was like
well that just means i'm just asking me if i want to die right he's like no i can shield you and blah
blah blah i was like okay yeah let's go which is so weird like my mind is so stupid sometimes i don't
even understand it but um and i'm not claiming that what i saw was god i'm just talking about
the experiences that i had but there was a thing that can be seen and basically what he said was
what he communicated to me was there are three perspectives from which you can observe god
in your as as the being you are one is the feminine one is the gender neutral and the other is the
masculine and he showed me them in that order and i could not remember the feminine or the neutral but i do
recall the masculine and it strongly resembles something young described having seen in a pond in a field
which was this being this shining luminous being made of tendrils within which were like living stars
and it was it was it was sort of cephalopod except it didn't have a head it was many of these arcing
tendrils like the prominences of the suns and they were filled with these shining luminescent interacting
star things that i understood to be the souls of beings and the angels and all the beings
all of the moments of all of the beings are interacting in that in some kind of a flow state
or a transcendental state in that form that i saw that's what i remember as best as i can describe it
and the only representation i've ever seen in human images that is reminiscent of it
that occurs in a movie called brainstorm with christopher walken where they learn how to record
to figure out how to record human experience on a tape and then one of the researchers
who's who's having a stroke records her death there's an image they show there and it it's vaguely similar
to what i saw and did you pass through those images in that order from the feminine to the masculine
as i recall yes right well i mentioned um successive modulation so i mean that makes sense to me so you
had to successively modulate the image you had to pass through a series of of vistas essentially
is that is that accurate yes yes yes except i can remember absolutely nothing about the first two
nothing at all only that that i did them that's all i remember that's really fascinating
yeah it's i could say a lot about that uh by all means unless someone else has something let
let it make make with the yeah yeah make with the insight bro give us the purple
yeah so i mean the entity still has a wave structure although you can only experience
it in this modulated fashion like a wave so basically you yourself are a wave which is successively
modulated to some entity um yes yes yes but that entity itself as far as i can tell from your
description lacks any kind of image although it you know it is imageable if you pass through these
successive modulations you're you're basically you're gaining a panoply or a multiplicity of vistas
on the same object which i think is what's happening in general um so the resolution of the image is
changing according to this kind of expansive or contractive motion so it's like you're you're zooming in
or zooming out on the same transcendental object um but you can never see one or the other you have to
see both in this kind of successive fashion as i said um there there needs to be this kind of
primordial comparison for there to be anything like an image um yes yes there has to be an absence
there has to be a presence and then there has to be an iterative transformation
of the absence and the presence over time right yeah so so they really coexist so they're they're like
dual principles they they have equal status almost um yeah and which one is the feminine
well i think in my view the feminine would be more like the simultaneous form of time
whereas the masculine is more like the successive form of time oh we agree about that yeah yeah i agree
but in space it takes the form of a contraction so so the female form in space is more like a
contractive motion whereas the male form is more like an expansive motion
yeah that's what toy maker said he was like gravity feminine emission masculine okay right so not only
that i mean you probably know the etymological root of gravity right
i think so but you can remind me gravitas no it means filled with eggs bro
straight up filled oh nice interesting yeah yeah
every female child that was ever born has all those eggs just waiting in her ovaries yeah gravity
straight up right well in order for there to be a contractive motion there needs to be a center
and that center is what i mean by simultaneity so that's why i think they're connected but
yeah and you can see it in the form of the female body as well it's it's present there too
uh yeah say more about that please i'm i'm i'm all ears and other other organs too
i mean you can see it in the face and you can also see it in the body so
you know the female genitals are basically just contracted male genitals and vice versa
male genitals are expanded female genitals they form a kind of symmetry
um so you know like the testicles are basically just externalized ovaries so if you take ovaries
and you blow them out and you expand them you get you get you get a scrotum like so so there's a wave
motion present there as well um but the face i think also encodes the same information so you could
actually reconstruct the body from an understanding of the morphology of the head there's like a there's
an emanation there i think or there's an enclosure so like enough information is contained in the face
to reconstruct the body so that's what i think that's what i also mean by memory so there's like
a memory encoded or present in the form of the body itself um you know so on average sorry you talk to
that what why you say that what your what your understanding of that is what you observe yeah so if you take like
the male face the forehead is large the eyes are small the nose is large the cheekbones are small
and the the mandible is large so it's like it's it's oscillating back and forth as you move from top to
bottom which the body itself also reflects as you move from the shoulders to the breasts to the abdomen
down to the genitalia so um so basically males have large expanded genitals in the form of like you
know the penis and the testicles because of the because of their mandible it's because of their
their jaws um and some of this might actually be borne out in genetics as well because um um
genes typically encode information across you know disparate parts of the body
so i know that for example your genitals are connected to your ears genetically so if you change
the structure of your ears you'll also change something about your genitals and vice versa
so if natural selection is acting on a specific phenotypic trait it actually has more than one
genotypic effect so really the organism evolves as a coherent unit it's not as if like natural selection is
is isolating or individuating specific phenotypic traits and then privileging them
really these phenotypic traits they evolve as unities or holes which is why i think punctuated
equilibrium is is on the right track it's not like a gradualist paradigm like darwin thought
because darwin thought that like different traits in the organism are selected and then preferentially
modified but what really happens is that the the entire organism changes as a complete unit
um so there really are no intermediate you know missing links in the fossil record
basically speciation takes place very rapidly and and instantaneously effectively so um
anyway yeah so yeah i hope that makes sense um yeah it does i'm interesting just in terms of
speciation and you know the bible and everything and and what you know what has been written you know
in terms of this whole argument about you know evolution versus no god puts you here exactly
right where you are in terms of consciousness is always an interesting one and then i also wanted
to sort of just mention breathing um the inhale the inhalation and the exhalation and the inhalation
being the female contraction and absorb being all and the exhalation being the resultant expression
for the next what we're putting out there with our breath to be inhaled by everything and you know
and everyone so what the question i have is i don't know if this connects with it but the whole
i don't agree with that but the the neutral portion at the beginning of the breath before the breath is
taken and after the breath has has been let out there's a time between breathing and in other words
between manifestation of anything in particular and which is also a time i've found like in doing kundalini
yoga whatever years ago that when that the breathe you can get to a point where you're really not
breathing and you know you're not having the experience of either breathing in or breathing out
and in that space is when you're i'd say my experience has been that you're most connected
i was most connected um to the oneness if you want to call it that and i wondered if anybody
wanted to address that at all or sees that or has experienced that um themselves and what they think
lies in that spot in the in the scheme of all that we're talking about i'd like to say something
about that briefly and i'm interested to hear if anyone else has anything to say after me
uh because i really want to always come first in conversations yeah
you know my my my statement's the most important thing so everybody should come after me yeah um
that's my left hemisphere talking anyway when i was met when i when i first began to study zen
and i was trying to understand what the hell they were trying to get us to understand or see or have
an experience of i discovered there were two places in the breath cycle where i kind of almost disappeared
and one of them was at the bottom of the exhalation and that's the really deep one
and the other one was at the top of the inhalation and that one wasn't as deep
but it was also noticeable that's all i have to say about that
so you can actually rest
and look free divers are the people you want to talk to about this right because they take one breath
and then they go but um you can rest
when i was meditating regularly i found that i could rest at the exhalation
for you know 30 40 50. it seemed like i might be able to go forever without taking another breath
sometimes i'm not sure what was actually going on it's so weird almond hillman's weird nasally vocal
music has infected me somehow so so weird to hear that but um i uh i realized there were times when i
did not have to breathe and i wasn't holding my breath for at least 45 seconds and possibly a few
minutes i wasn't counting right because i was just resting in meditation but i'm not sure we have to breathe
like i i have a sense that the body can do some pretty crazy things with oxygen that we're just not
aware of and free divers are an example of that but i think yogis and gurus probably know stuff that
even free divers don't know so those are some of my thoughts does that match up with what you were
talking about nancy or did i misunderstand i think you're muted
yeah sorry thank you um okay yeah what i was saying is it it does to some degree um and there's a
physiological part to mention that i understand which is that um you actually don't need to breathe
as much as you think you do there's a lot of oxygen that's actually accumulated in your body
be which is like free divers i think it was something that i saw on some show about free
drivers or whatever um so that's just one thing but the other thing is i and and i and i had a similar
experience to you it's on the exhalation that um i mean the inhalation you've got the breath and
you're not taking a breath but you can exhale and it take it can be quite a while before you
have to inhale again but i guess i was talking about it more in terms of what the how that meaning
ties to what it is that or how that is reflective of what we were talking about in terms of male and
female and i mean you said that there were three things that were shown to you male and female
you didn't remember them all but the um but what you remembered was male but
there were two other states you were saying the toy maker showed you and i was wondering whether
you thought i guess that either the inhalation or i think the exhalation
was not some kind of a loop within those states because really the inhalation
of having breath and it is at the top of the at the top of the ticket you know when you breathe in
you're holding your breath but you still have that breath you may not you know release it yet
but you are filled you know with the breathing of and having everything in it you're you're
assimilating it or whatever and then and then you exhale which is part of the process of letting it go
but once you've let it go at that point which is you're saying at the at the base of the of the quad
quad square um you know what what do you think that equates to in terms of
what we're talking about maybe it's more triune in the sense there really is only inhalation exhalation
and no inhalation or exhalation i i don't know prior i i don't know i just wondered if you thought
it kind of fit with anything but i i don't have a horse in the race i just was curious if you if you
had thought of it relationally to what we're talking about that's all or anybody had
yeah i mean the motion i think can be gendered um
um morphologically which is my usual preoccupation but yeah i mean embryonic respiration was an ancient
taoist technique so the idea that you could engage in breathing without using your lungs was really an
ancient practice and it has a lot of um applications to yoga um there appears to have been some kind of
continuity between taoism and indian alchemy and yoga um yeah
which you know had a sexual component so you know like taoist alchemy had a sexual dimension because of
at least uh as far as i know um you know semen retention was one of the practices that a taoist was
expected to undergo as part of his own alchemical transmutation um but you know eastern alchemy was
certainly distinct from you know western alchemy in the sense that the taoists were mostly concerned
with achieving immortality um they were concerned with communing with immortal beings and and gods
whereas i think the western alchemical tradition was was differently founded um
um you know um um yeah but you know swedenborg goes into that too so
yeah but i think when i when i look at like a living organism i see its parts as expressions of what
you might call gender or this polarity between male and female but motion issues from that polarity
um when you deal with the equi primordial situation where the two principles are coexisting
that seems more like stasis to me it seems like inertia um which i think is also present in the body
so if you look at a living being you'll see not either one principle or another but you'll see both
simultaneously and that simultaneity gives rise to this like percept of an object something which has
an identity something which has some kind of inertial motion um something that can be identified right
so that's my my only yeah so you're basically i just to make sure i'm understanding correctly i mean
basically is it is it balance or inertia is it balanced before something needs to change
before there's the the something has grown swollen and and needs to either change into its opposite or
you have some kind of i mean is that what you're saying when you talk about i mean i know of course in
in all asian you know acupuncture and everything like that the organs are very much thought of in
in terms of male or female and you know and energetic flows as well so i just i mean
are you are you saying something which is basically says what is on some level what is is
as it's been manifested and therefore that's at that point where there is balance there's no movement
and that's the yeah the stasis of it well the body itself is balanced because the body itself is a
unity that reflects the surrounding universe so bodies exist and reflect the unity of the universe and as
a form of the universe um so if you were to you could basically understand what the universe is by
understanding everything about a single object or a single living being but what i think differs is
the the resolution so you can think of something like a tree as as an image of the entire universe
at a certain resolution which is modulated by your own body
you know so it's so your brain is a wave which is passing through an external field
um and that motion gives rise to a percept in space because space has a holographic structure
and this is what i think modern science or physics probably gets wrong because we tend to think that
darkness is merely the absence of light whereas i think that darkness actually has a determinate structure
it has um an informative nature it actually informs what manifests in space so
yeah so but they are coeval so light and darkness are are coeval they only emerge together because they
reveal an even deeper unity between them so so light isn't something and darkness isn't something they
both co-arise um and they both reflect this underlying uh wholeness which itself never manifests as an object or
incarnates as a being but right yeah it's a britain yeah it's it's what's beyond the beings and it's what
actually yeah darren was talking about it is on off i think and how we got there
okay so remember the dandelion thing
the dandelion thing where everything collapses to unity and then expands back to distinction
in the between of that process what you have is a highly sophisticated multi-dimensional tree like
structure um and that tree has to do with what i would call near neighbors and now we're getting into
that um starts to mirror certain branches of physics and particularly um okay
two concepts one from lee cronin and sarah walkers
a truly astonishing and possibly partly stolen version of complexity theory that is
insanely brilliant and also very weird so what they have a thing called
radar love no i'm kidding um they have a thing called
okay hang on
not smaller cronin it's some kind of a graph
um
some kind of a historical graph there's two words that are uh really important in in um
in cronin and walker's theory oh wow okay somebody's already noticed this
uh correlation between wolfram and cronin which is natural it's on i'm seeing it on r lex fred friedman
on uh causal graphs yep that's it and those things have to do with near neighbors so in um
in wolfram's computational model the name of which escapes me at the moment
um this principle is this principle is obviously present it's blatantly obvious that um there's a
there are paths through structure time and relation where where what i'm going to call intimacy but what he
would call proximity matters and it's the same thing is true with these causal uh historical causal graphs
in um assembly theory is what what cronin is calling their version of complexity theory
uh and by the way that assembly theory stuff is insanely amazing
but it may be totally wrong i've edited a page some some work from an another scientist
who's basically the only one out front refuting the claims of assembly theory uh what is his name
he's got like an 80 page essay on medium that i edited for him because it it really needed to be
edited and he agreed to have me do it um and he's claiming that a lot of the claims of assembly theory are
just bullshit um they're just it's like a sort of rock star thing where you make a bunch of claims
that sound really exciting but they they have uh cronin has ignored the entire history of of
complexity theory and basically just claimed to have invented all this when he certainly didn't
in any case what i'm really trying to get is there's a tree structure between what i'll call the
membrane of the dandelion which is total distinction and the core of the dandelion which is um singularity
reunion communion unity that tree structure is very trippy it has a lot of crazy qualities those qualities
have to do with the origins probably of magic alchemy philosophy geometry um i can't say a lot of very
useful specific things about them i'm just pointing at them like a monkey that's on fire going like that
thing that tree that tree over there that thing in the between of the blah blah blah yeah that's me
yeah yeah that makes a lot of sense to me too
um i tend not to think in terms of trees but i think i can see how that would work um
you know so for example like i tend to think of green as the appearance of cyan through yellow so i think
in terms of the composition or the relation or the proximity of different phenomena
you know but i tend not to render it as a tree um so in the same way that green arises as cyan through
yellow a petal is the appearance of a stem leaf through a sepal so it works in the same way it has
the same essentially holographic nature so i think in terms of media or composition which i think space is
providing because space is like facilitating these forms of communion um so the reason that they're
the reason that the colors of the rainbow exist i think is by virtue of space not by
virtue of anything in light itself it's not like what newton thought um so
so those those same properties are present in our own bodies like in your head and in your in your
abdomen like in your organs okay as spatial beings we're also articulating these principles yeah i agree
and and a tree isn't the only way to think about it by a long shot um there's like a graph isn't a tree
so yeah you don't have to think about it like a tree and yet at the same time
um you know we have these structures here called trees that are pretty insane to put it mildly and
probably uh are both holophoric and uniform at the same time meaning like they relate to all specific
things in a very peculiar way and they relate to everything at once in a very peculiar way at the same
time right yeah no i think the same way um but when i look at a tree i see a waveform you can i think
you can actually count the number of waves in the tree as a being i think it's probably three so there
are three so basically the tree folds into itself three times over the course of its life cycle
before it disappears so it's like you're looking at a wave that crashes into itself three times so it has
a certain number it's like um which i think probably reflects something beyond space but yeah that
number is curious to me about that sorry what's that about i could well could you speak about that
portion of it the tree and what about the three times it collapses into itself yeah so i mean if you look
at a seed a seed a seed is essentially a point of contraction from the fruit so the seed appears
within the fruit in the same way that um later over the course of its life cycle um the calyx or the
sepals contract from from the stem leaves so you can think of this in chronological order so what actually
takes place logically takes place logically over the course of time as you observe this being move
through space and grow um so the seed is basically a point of contraction the roots emerge from the
seed as well as the the the seed leaves which are called cotyledons the cotyledons also exhibit this
kind of contraction because they're centered on the same axial node and their resolution is much more diffuse
um than the later stem leaves so their appearance is much more um waxy they appear fuzzy they appear
ill-defined or poorly defined with respect to the later stem leaves which usually appear highly serrated
so you see this kind of serration that takes place as you move from the seed leaves to the more mature
stem leaves but the stem leaves they alternate back and forth um and their kind of staggering motion
along the stem i think is really a consequence of this kind of successive form of time characterized by
this expansion in space so when you have expansion in space like with the stem
you tend to exhibit or see this kind of succession or alternation um so what happens from there is a
subsequent contraction around the calyx where the sepals form the sepals are basically just contracted
stem leaves so if you take a stem leaf and you you collapse them around a common center you'll get a
calyx you'll get basically a sepal so really these organs are just articulations of the same fundamental
entity which itself you know never embodies itself it never incarnates as an object but from that point
of contraction in the calyx then you have this again this like secondary expansion in the form of
the petals which again are staggered they form a whorl what do you mean by it never contracts it never
becomes an object what does that mean so each organ or region of the plant body reflects
an entity which is outside space and time but which governs its motion through space and time
so basically this entity is absent and its absence is a kind of activity that stimulates motion in space
and time so the reason that the plant moves as it does uh the reason that the plant abides by its logic
it takes place by virtue of this transcendental being it's like uh it's really like a platonic idea
or a form which every region of the plant articulates it's it's just like what darren was talking about
when he had his experience of i think what he called god he had to pass through these like successively
modulated images that's what the plant is also doing the plant is providing you with this successively
modulated image in the form of its own organs or regions like if you if you look at the body of a
flower you'll see these different regions like what linnaeus categorized you know taxonomically we have these
taxonomic names for different parts of living things um so yeah the wave-like structure it
passes through these expansions and contractions which are never complete they're always incomplete
because they they they co-extend or they co-exist in the body there's never this like pure predominance
of one principle over another but the sexual organs in the gymnosperm or in the flowering plant are a
kind of contraction that move from the petals so basically the stamens and the pistils are like
petals that have been contracted again so basically if you take any region of a plant you could reconstruct
its entire body if you understood the waveform uh adequately enough um that's what i mean by a wave
in time i wonder if um you know if i might receive this maybe in another way you know open to hear how
you feel about it but maybe it also kind of approaches nancy's question um you know when i look at a tree
and what i mean you know when i physically with my eyeballs there's complexity to this but anyway
you know this is the simple version when i look at a tree am i looking at a tree i mean
you know what i'm looking at really is the the imprint you know the the what the form of the tree has
created you know the it's the residue of its of its actions you know and so as i look at this i have
this big beautiful ginkgo in my backyard and if you know about ginkgo's they're an ancient tree can you
talk up a little bit for some reason it's not that it's not that clear yeah let me know if that's any
better again i'm using a new mic um you know so when i look at a tree any better yeah yes it's better now
oh great yeah so when i when i look at this ginkgo in my backyard i mean i see what it's done
on this material plane you know but do i see its spirit you know do i see its essence because you
know one thing that i'm not seeing is its desire you know somehow in some way this tree it reaches
and it grows and it it is a happening you know it is a process continually evolving right and and what
it's done here the form that i that i look at is the residue of something that i'm not seeing
it's it's desire i guess is the way i'd say it and that's really interesting because i look at this
lumber or i look at these leaves and i'm not seeing the true nature of the tree which is this um
this becoming you know this essence manifesting itself right but you know if i also if i if i just
think oh trees want to grow you know it it loves the sun and incorporates it it loves the soil and
and builds upon it it loves the water and uses it and it brings these things together you know if i
look at the essence of the tree like what drives it to become what i'm not seeing the lumber i'm not
seeing its residue i'm not seeing the leaves these things are co-eval you know co-eval as um i think
uh tyler said they they co-arise and they're from a place that's beyond this matter which is interesting
but you know they they could not they could not be anything if they weren't also of this matter
and these two things relate to each other they depend on each other there they cannot be separated
there's always um you know the happening is a mix of what is and what could be you know so i don't
know if that's maybe another way to say it yeah i think so so the invisible underlies the visible
both in terms of material bodies in space and in terms of light i think light works similarly so the
essence of light actually is invisible so what we see as light isn't light itself it's actually an effect
of something which never incarnates so there's i think there's a symmetry there that needs to be seen
um and i just wanted to mention that you know the waveform in the plant that you perceive and that you
might come to know is also something that i think is wedded to your own existence so basically the reason
that you can perceive the waveform in space is because you yourself your brain is a kind of wave
so when you come to know an entity in space the distinction between those waves just collapses so
when you really know what a plant is you become plant-like because your your your brain as a wave
is simply harmonizing with the wave that exists in the external holographic field so i think that's what
knowledge is it has to do with this harmonization or synchronization between these waveforms in space
um like yeah um but there are three of them in the body of the plant or there are three transitions
because you have this primordial coupling between the seed and the cotyledons then you have another
coupling between the stem and the sepals you have another coupling between the petals
and the sexual organs and finally you have a coupling between the um sorry between the um
the fruit and the seed so there are these there are these three transitions that i think take place
which are each characterized by an expanding and contracting flow field so that that expanding
and contracting flow field is really a single motion it's like if you were to twist an object in space
like if you were to twist a cube in space you would see an expanding flow field and a contracting flow
field at the same time by virtue of the symmetry period of the cube so it has it has a symmetry
period of four because it it moves into itself four times per 360 degrees of rotation the plant is doing
the same thing but it's not in space it's taking place in time i think it's taking place in in
yeah some kind of holographic sense and that's what gives rise to these these forms that we
that we taxonomically classify but they're not actually distinct forms they're part of the same object
um so imagine that motion of being carried into yourself as you know you you can visualize this
spinning object that's what i think a plant really is and that's what you come to know when you see
the waveform but when you see the waveform your brain is also your your own wave is doing that
um that's what i think knowledge really is and that's why this like whole paradigm of like you know
scientific control systems and cybernetics it just totally misses the point of what knowledge is
um control is anathema to knowledge it really has no place in epistemology
um i mean the question is how can you know anything right and and in talking about
i guess what daryl was talking about um the um
the assembly theory and why it was being refuted um and and also about the triune nature of things
i think it's training nature talking about the membrane of the dandelion for example as a total
distinction which would be as observed that would be almost the unquestioned observation mode maybe
i'm not understanding this correctly but correct me as observed and then the tree itself being our ability
to understand the components of change through time swirling through time through through time and then
the core singularity is really this is the unification of us and of the observed too i think maybe
the core singularity um is the core singularity is the unity that occurs again in the realization
of the unity i mean of our own unity and of the unity of the tree and then anything it's almost like
a process more than anything else does that make sense or am i just not understanding
no i think so i i mean i would say that when you see a tree you really see something about yourself
in the same way that when you peer into the darkness of space you really see something about your own
nature you're actually looking at yourself in a certain sense um you're seeing your own wholeness
so your ability to grasp the external world is proportional to your own capacity for metacognition
and self-knowledge so they go together you need both which is why i think control is anathema to
knowledge it doesn't actually work it doesn't actually give you knowledge um yeah i hope i'm
understanding um your point though does that make sense or is am i missing something yeah it does i
think so i mean i think we're saying the same thing but i think that's also that maybe it's me just
projecting the i mean that is the journey with everything is that triune journey it's three it is
always three parts and that's what i often thought like the parable of the of the you know the garden
of eden was in the apple of knowledge i mean it's just like on one level there you are thinking
everything is what it is then you look at it more deeply and you see its parts and then you return to
the core singularity with that understanding of the oneness and also the parts and then of course
it starts again and again and again that's if that makes any sense
all right so i want to go back to something i was hearing corn fed talk about which is that when
we see the thing we're not seeing the thing we're seeing
it's almost like we're seeing
a structured
a temporal concrete sense
that hides the thing
when i look at the tree i'm exactly not seeing the church
everything that the tree truly is is hidden from me
its nature all kinds of things about the tree its desire its relationships its its loves its fears all
these things are hidden and i'm seeing a static image of like
it's like mistaking the shell for the hermit crab or something like this i want a better analogy than
that and it's the same when someone sees me they don't see me who sees me what could possibly see me
if i was understanding corn fed and his concerns i think these questions are super important to preserve
yeah really i like what you said i i think the analogy of the shell and the murmur crab is really
interesting let me you know maybe to say it in another way that approaches uh nancy's triune i think
i don't know who'd be wrong but this is to borrow an alan watts expression right
um and then you know just to say i think tyler's point about the connections
you know the the co-happenings of these relationships being the ultimate reality not
you know not the separate things i think is really important but i just want to put that aside for a
moment i think that's such a marvelous observation but you know just to kind of get at what this is
you know alan watts will use something like the tongue tasting itself
can the tongue taste itself you know we we are the tongue tasting itself and to just pull that apart
a little bit you know there's the tongue this apparatus it has these faculties i mean potentially
it just is you know it has a structure and then there's the tasting
which is an experience you know it's a it's a you know it's a it's a feeling it's it's not an
apparatus right to taste is it's not an apparatus the experience of tasting but then there's a thing
that happens in the middle there which is really interesting these two things that cannot exist
independently taste can't exist without a tongue and the tongue's function is to taste
you know they they can't exist independently somehow there's this bit of magic in there which is the
act you know the will that somehow bridges the gap and brings it you know all into all into some kind
of beautiful emergence that's exactly it's exactly it it's the will
yeah the tongue itself is a kind of tasting which is important to recognize and vice versa
tasting is a kind of tonguing they actually they co-arise right
you know sort of like i mean like i said green is a relation in the same way an organ is a relation
light itself white light is a relation darkness is a relation they're not they're not individuated
beings i mean we we use language to refer to individual things but uh physically i don't think
they're actually individuated they they have a similar co-extensive foundation
um so the universe i think probably evolves as a unit just like living things you know and it's
probably rapidly evolving so like in other words in the same way that the body of a living thing
undergoes rapid speciation the physical constants that govern phenomena in the universe themselves
probably undergo rapid change um seems likely to me um but i want to yeah i want to move away from
kantianism for sure you know this notion that what i see is some kind of representation or epiphenomenon
of a transcendental object which itself is unknowable i definitely want to move away from that
epistemology because i think that we can know beings uh but i think for that to be possible we need a more
coherent philosophy of time because what um yeah what i think what i think distinguishes beings is time
um as opposed to space and what we see when we peer into the external world is
uh what beings themselves are at certain scales of time so what i see as a tree really is a tree
at a specific scale of time which corresponds to something within my own organism or or existence
so in this so basically the tree reflects something about my own existence as i perceive it but what i
perceive is nevertheless real it really exists where it says it exists in external space um you know
whereas kant would say no what you see is maya it's some kind of illusion projected by your own categories
of understanding or something like that um yeah that view i certainly want to move away from um and
that's what i tend to mean by realism i think it's i think it's it's it's justifiable to say that what
we see really exists and it's not mere merely some kind of projection or um representation yeah
representationalism i really want to move away from because i think it's just an artifact of language
i don't think it's a physical yeah if you say that okay go ahead if you say that aren't you really
saying as well when we look at that tree you know of course our abilities to look at anything are
limited by the range that we're programmed to look at things through so in terms of looking just sign
you know at the tree obviously scientifically you can take a microscope and see something different
you know you can you can zoom in and you'll see you'll see the tree on different levels at a
particular moment in time you know you'll also have a feeling about the tree at that moment in time
which is probably i think more important to us in terms of our being and what it is we love
about the tree in our experience i think there's different levels of what seeing might mean but
i'm just throwing that in there so right yeah i think that i think that we could be radically different
in our morphological constitution what we see as a tree might differ radically between us but what we
what we see still exists as a tree that's something that i want to embrace so what actually distinguishes
those two percepts i think is simply a scale of time it has nothing to do with identity um got it and
that's yeah my own my own aversion to kantianism all right so look
this is a situation where i think we all have biases and we also often in our biases are
we are enacting very particular concerns
and i value those biases i have biases of my own um i think a lot about representations
and the problem of representations in consciousness
i think it's possible and i'm certainly willing to hear arguments against this from you tyler
that we might be better off preserving both concerns
um so that we we see both uh the perspective that eliminates the concern with the representation of the tree
and the perspective that preserves it um
and i'm going to introduce another weird toy which is just a sort of a i don't know how to call this
what is it it's uh it's a poetic insight i had one night while looking at some trees
um and the inside one like this imagine if like we're looking at these oak trees right and have these
like really complex branch structures because it's winter and all the the leaves i think are gone from
the tree right so you can see the whole the whole weird squiggly dome of the branch structure of the oak tree
and i turned to my friend i was like
what if every one of those branches
is the record of that tree reaching out toward another being or a bird or something passing by
trying to touch it but always by the time it got anywhere near where the bird or the being was the bird or the being was long gone
and so what you see in the canopy and the branch structure of the tree is actually the entire history of the tree's desire
that makes sense to me
i certainly would say um
there's all kinds of phenomena the tree reaches for
that's for sure
you know i i i wanted to chip in there too and i think that
we're probably all largely aware of this but i think it's so important
um of course you know the language we use
the concepts we employ
to try to come to any of this you know is uh it's a it's a total clusterfuck
yeah and so it's hard to hear you is there any way you can
yeah thank you i don't know if this is any better
um i'll switch to something after this
no it's completely
completely oh good okay yeah i guess a microphone close to my face
um you know the the just quickly what i wanted to say is that you know like i use kind of the
kantian way to describe the tree and at the same time too of course i totally agree with what tyler's
saying and in response to that and i think it's it's so important the nature of our discussion
to try to tackle reality i think like you know darren or perhaps was saying it evades scope entirely
you know it it is true from numerous perspectives simultaneously you know the thing that we're
trying to describe is um is true in so many ways and untrue in just as many ways and it's all these
things all together simultaneously and of course you know we have this convention of language like the
way that our minds have been patterns to think and communicate with each other and you know i i think
you know i've heard this from others like therein for example but i think it's just still having a
hard time still i don't know if other people but still having a little bit of a hard time hearing you
yeah and i i would just say that
of language is to take this multiplicity of realities like this the you know if if i'm
holding an object right like i get one perspective on it and i need to turn it and look at it in
another way and turn it again and look at it another way and like get below it or underneath
it to understand it as i think darren has said i need to get inside of it
and through its eyes you know i need to transcend the dynamic of looking all together in order to
understand it you know there's so many so many truths but but the problem with language of course
is that it it doesn't just flatten it this reality in the two dimensions it it you know draws it into a
single line and and what's worse it's a line of dissection and parts you know and so when describing
these things i think we all are speaking beyond the words and i think trying to take that in is
you know helpful to our conversation for what it's worth
