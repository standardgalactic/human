so excited to have this time to chat together I've since we've met through the unique channels
in which our relationship was established I've just been astonished by the the breadth and scope
of your philosophical and intellectual concerns so it's it's amazing just to have this chance to
hang out together and share some of the stuff so that others can perhaps benefit or enjoy a conversation
a recent conversation a couple people were very excited and they were like I just wish I had the
chance to engage in conversations like that so hopefully there's there's some vicarious distribution
of the spirit conversations so you and I this morning we had I gave a complex overview of recent
developments in what we might call the disclosure quote-unquote situation as it has transformed and
progressed particularly since the allegations of David Grush in approximately May or June of last
year and we talked about Grush's allegations Diana Walsh basulka dr. basulka we talked about some
Gary Nolan's concerns and comments we began with talking a little bit about Jacques Vall√©e and let's
see what else did we cover I talked a little about the implications of any branch of any group of humans
who might be in possession of alien or non-human artifacts vehicles or intelligence related to non-human
intelligences and then a little bit about the bill that I think partially passed I don't actually know
the status of that bill at the moment and a little bit about the the congressional hearings involving the
two fighter pilots and David Grush and you had some very important concerns about the entire affair if you
could you please take a moment and outline those concerns and how and so your thoughts on stopping yeah I mean most of that was news to me because I think I chose to remain ignorant of recent developments after my investigation of what happened in 2017
and what happened in 2017 the Pentagon videos right keep going I'm just gonna close this window so we get this car noise and more use now yeah so I mean my only concern is really with
counterintelligence you know and parsing what in the modern UFO disclosure movement
originates from what I would consider to be a genuinely scientific enterprise and what appears to be masquerading as something scientific under the guise of some kind of elaborate
some kind of some kind of elaborate continuity of operations plan of some kind which tends to be my default suspicion
mm-hmm yeah but I find that that helps me orient my perspective so yeah
you spoke a little bit earlier about concerns related to an apparatus for control of the humans the opposite the paradox out the paradox of disclosure as you saw it and also the
the problematical features of a structure in which the humans are constantly appealing to some kind of authority structure and or maybe an ersatz
religion in hope of a transcendent solution you know to to our prop to climate change and energy scarcity and ecological devastation and war and disease and so on
so yeah feel free to just again you know circle us around some of your concerns and insights around this
yeah I think I mean disclosure is somewhat self-contradictory in the sense that what I think would inevitably be disclosed is that our approach to the acquisition of scientific knowledge as well as the idea of some kind of
some kind of authoritative transmission of information would both be undermined I think so so the essence of disclosure would be the revelation that our approach to science itself is misguided so that that disclosure I think would be intrinsically liberating in the sense that yeah we need to forego this fixation on technological solutions
yeah so my only concern is that insofar as we believe in these authoritative transmissions of information we set ourselves up to be exploited or predicted or controlled given the given the complex catastrophes that might be in store for us imminently
yeah so I tend to suspect some kind of continuity of government or business operations beneath these uh sophisticated counterintelligence experiments which really seem to be what some of these accounts reveal um yeah so as soon as I began to suspect that I started to disconnect
from the topic from the topic from the topic and the news surrounding it and the hullabaloo
yeah because I felt like I was seeing the same kind of game enacted again and again so
yes once I felt like I understood the game plan I stopped like fixating on it you know
that was just my own choice well a self-protective choice obviously like um in order for us to have the
wherewithal and the psychological and intellectual hygiene necessary to pursue rich and deep concerns with insight understanding the reconciliation of what we consider to be valuable knowledge in the direction that removes the occlusions that our culture and society place there
right in order to be sort of athletically capable of such things we can't be hauling around the dross of misinformation disinformation
uh psyops conspiracy theories all of these things right but I want to go so I want to step through some of the features of what you have proposed here which I find astonishingly clarifying and clear-minded whether or not it is
it is what we should take to be the case it's profoundly important I think it's a perspective that had never occurred to me in such in such a clear way prior to our discussion and with which I was deeply impressed
so I'm going to try to paraphrase back to you some of my understanding
um paradoxically what when we hear this word disclosure what we think is what we are likely to think
hang on a moment
we're likely to think uh something resembling oh um now the organs of power in the government and the military are going to do us the incredible favor of coming clean to us about the history of their knowledge of interactions and the
with non-human intelligence UFOs recovered vehicles biologics reverse engineering
uh free energy um you know universal love uh you name it right like I think the last one's kind of a joke
so so yeah when we hear this phrase disclosure this is what we're thinking ah the authorities will finally give forth with the truth about the sky beings or the you know
um interdimensional travelers that have been interacting with us and and you are saying like not only would that not represent useful disclosure what actually needs to be disclosed is the incredible confusing obfuscating lies that have comprised our understandings about science nature existent and
existence ontology epistemology and so forth right like like an actual disclosure would free us from a long history of slave making
prison nearing agendas by 19 different factions among the humans who are you know impossible cahoots with other intelligences right like yeah there's a huge mess so so yeah feel free to uh elaborate correct or just talk about yeah like continuing to petition surrogate authority
yeah like continuing to petition surrogate authority figures is part of the problem beautiful right so i think disclosure would undermine that entire approach to um information or knowledge yeah so are you using disclosure in a person in a special personal meaning here just when you say disclosure would undermine do you mean the disclosure i was talking about or do you mean actual disclosure i mean i think what you are okay great yeah please continue about that then yeah show how would disclosure undermine that yeah i mean i mean i think what you are okay great yeah please continue about that then
so yeah so so yeah so so in my view i see technology mythology and language as being interconnected in our evolution and in our history which modern science reflects back in a certain sense um so disclosure i think would necessarily reveal that relationship
that's a lot of underpinnings of underpinnings of the structures of authority which we are used to both authorizing believing celebrating hoping for relief from hoping for rescue from and and so please continue part part of our predicament part of our enslavement i think is bound up with the fact that technology is a kind of concealment
of something technological is like intrinsically problematic for me so I
immediately become skeptical whenever I think about you know if only you know
this surrogate authority figure reveals some novel you know technological
artifact then you know all of our energy crises can be solved overnight yeah I
just I don't necessarily buy into that religious myth I mean it's it's a real
it's a religious narrative I think it's it's like it's a it's it's one of the
foundations of our entrapment yeah yeah I see so a broad array of obfuscating lies
right fictions that have long been promulgated curated purposefully curated
and developed to keep our species and the citizens and so on in this bizarre
situation of being beholden to authorities that have no authority actually have no
intrinsic authority they are fictional authorities with a fictional library of
prisoner in lies that they want us to swallow and so the idea that they like
trot out the UFOs and the aliens and and go like you know here's we are the
purveyors of the information about the non-human intelligences and now we're
going to validate your your the strange ideas and it's an attempt to seize control
right when the actual revelation is that their authority is illegitimate right
that's brilliant that's why it's oh my god that's why it's so ironic yeah Wow
that's incredible because I think many of us are are sitting around thinking oh this
will be the true revelation that will penetrate fictions and establish a new
vision of what it means to be human and what the sky beings or the not you know the
the ultra dimensionals and the the the ultra terrestrials possibly and the
underground bases on Mars and the gigantic underground structures in the United
States built by the devices you know produced by reverse engineering alien
technologies that you know which yeah I mean I'm laughing at these things but I
don't actually know the status of any of them there could be vast underground
labyrinths in a way not entirely dissimilar to what people like Steven Greer
proposes I don't know you know I have no idea what the military-industrial complex
has been up to over the past 60 years in in secrecy for example but it does seem if one
of the things that seems wildly unlikely is that any existing structure within the government
is sophisticated enough to be able to tell us what's going on right even if they had vehicles
and information and bodies and intelligence I just I find it wildly unlikely particularly given what
we've the stories we've heard about when they bring someone in to study something and what happens when
that goes on and those stories can can be highly curated themselves we don't know so if I understand you
correctly a you're extremely skeptical about the idea of a disclosure involving some technological
revelation right and that looks to you like a continuance of a long-standing operation a
continuance of a series of intentions on the parts of wildly untrustworthy features of our government and
society with which we would have we would have to be insane to take seriously and trust yes it would
be signing up for evisceration of our sanity and perhaps capacity to understand anything if we signed up
for that yes these are the least trustworthy people to be telling us narratives about anything at all let
alone the origins of time-space or organisms or you know intelligence or anything like that and so
anything that they trot out is necessarily not merely pre compromised but intentionally compromising with
very few if any exceptions and so an actual disclosure would have little to do with some sort of
technological revelation but might involve the peculiar the revelation of the peculiarly occlusive and deceptive and
disorienting fictions that have long ridden like sort of hitchhiked on what we call scientific endeavor but it's
actually a broad array of deceptively motivated and deceptively back narratized like we've got the wrong narrative about how these
things developed historically the domineering branches of these narratives are untrustworthy and confused in many cases
um particularly those cases that uh inspire us to expect um mechanistic materialistic reductionist
i'm sort of citing my own biases here so they're not playing these years um explanation of phenomenon cause and effect
effect the nature of things and so on and you've spoken previously and i'd love to hear more about this of
something related to what you have called a lost symbol right and it's it's sort of replacement by other
behaviors and things please right yeah please uh elucidate yeah well we can yeah certainly deal with that um
excellent yeah so in my interpretation of the history of technology
what we call utility derives from an even more arcane loss of something symbolic so this is why i mentioned
that technology mythology and language appear to be interwoven developments they actually
involve each other um and we can parse we can parse them but i think they really constitute a single
development within human evolution so the symbol precedes the utility of the object that we call
technological um but the eclipse of that symbol is what yields utility in history wow say okay help us
understand the structure of that perspective please yeah so i think in prehistory or in antiquity
human beings experienced their environment in terms of an all-pervading symbolic complex which
they attempted to embody in terms of certain icons or beings like fetishes or implements in other words
drawing down certain metaphysical principles or celestial intelligences
even in terms of like agriculture so you know we mentioned this before but
um agriculture arose in the context of this primeval symbolic dyad between the masculine and the feminine
principles within the process of birth uh death and potentially rebirth so
um so so so so an implement like the sickle is really an embodiment of a certain feminine power which is related to
the moon so the first sickles were actually constructed from the jaw bones of luminance like cattle or oryx
and so these people were basically grazing with this jaw bone over their environment um symbolically
reciting or recapitulating processes that they were observing in the natural world so perhaps singing
yeah singing singing right not speaking singing while they are doing this right again this yeah this kind
of symbol i think was bound up with the genesis of language in certain respects yeah holding the moon
symbolically using the moon which we could understand
okay there's so much here and i don't want to get lost but i'm just going to mention that
um in one of the blackfoot creation stories the moon
okay the sun and the moon are come to the earth and they are married here so they're they have a
hogan this is their hogan and they have seven children all boys and the sun and the children hunt
by day and the moon takes a lover um and in blackfoot culture the sun has a very adept sense of smell
this is the fundamental thing about the sun smells things and the lover is described as a what i would
call a prodigy in the sense of a prime primeval mystery a many-legged snake this is an english
translation a many-legged snake that lives in a hollow log and it has a scent the sun can smell it
now i have speculated that this could perhaps be bees right because a many-legged snake it's also clear
that um they're going to burn it the sun when they once they realize that the moon is like stepping out
on the sun the sun's going to kill the sun and the and the children are going to kill her lover and
have to burn it and they have to be very careful not to let a cinder get away a cinder which by the
way if you've ever been stung it feels like a cinder right you can go ow is something burning me right
especially if it's a hornet um so it the sun can smell the lover on her which i i suppose could possibly
be the smell of honey right and also what could be more appropriate the beehive is literally uh a
matriarchal society right it's the feminine intelligence that orchestrates and concentrates
the intelligences of the entire vegetal world and connects them all right and then produces this
incredible amazing substance called honey right and which is delicious and everyone wants some and
the bees produce far more than they could ever use so it's obvious that this is a symbol of
catastrophic abundance right of of uh so much abundance that it could not be used up right like
an infinite abundance just which is also very feminine now what happens is um when the moon
discovers that they've killed her lover she goes insane and becomes a sort of banshee-like presence
hunting them through the world and they are running away and the sun gives seven pouches seven is
probably very important but that's the number of the children this may in fact relate to the pleiades or
the dipper stars right these the seven number but also possibly the planets or maybe all three or
and something else we don't know about it gives them each a sort of a little um a little pouch and
there are various different things in the pouch one's a stick if you throw it down becomes a vast
force that's impenetrable another one's a rock if you throw it down becomes mountains that you can't get
across and there's various uh impediments that are given to the boys to try to impede the pursuing
banshee moon mother right and here's where things get interesting i think well the whole thing is
fascinating to me and important because it's it's way older than the stories were usually given i suspect
10 to 30 000 years old so compared to stuff we usually hear way older um so what happens is the
moon eventually catches up to them and the sun cuts off her leg and when he does that this somehow resolves
the the pursuit in the combat and they all end up in the sky and what the moon is doing as she's going
through the phases is she's regrowing and losing the leg over and over again in a cycle right so this
crescent right is literally like the cut or the cutting please continue oh okay yeah i mean that
makes perfect sense that's fascinating um i never knew that so um yeah so the sickle is of course a crescent
shape um and so you know the sickle was was really emblematic of death just like the scythe right with
the green paper right yeah yeah so by the way that's masculine plus feminine right you have the feminine
arc with the masculine rod and the combination of those kills yeah there's power i wanted to mention
as you were speaking too that you know i think the greek language contains seven vowels because of the
center right yeah yeah yeah also the vowel l this is the spirit sound these are the sounds of flow
right whereas the consonants are sounds of structure and so it's interesting also that in hebrew the
vowels are missing right they had to be supplied by a mind by living mind and were not written until the
masoretics started producing the uh the markings to indicate which vowels but think carefully about
how profound it is to have a language where the vowels have to be supplied by a living mind because
now you have you have the structure you have the dead part of the language which which are the you know
the consonants or whatever you want to call those and they have to be completed by a living mind they're
never they never have the whole dead thing written out and when you have to complete it by a living mind
surely as you're looking at the word you're thinking of some of the alternatives right what
if i use different what if i put different vowels here you're having a much more creative
and connotative and symbolic relationship with the formulation of the words the reading of the
words because if you're writing them you're going to be doing the same thing you're going to be
thinking like wow what if they think it means this oh what if it didn't mean that right and then
so you're really going to have a much richer manifold a sort of a cloud structure a possibility space
around the word that is profoundly different from what we have where the spelling is given for every
word always yeah but i think that was how language originally functioned in other words language was
originally a kind of vehicle whereby you could remember certain connections within the cosmos between
various phenomena so these symbols were bound together with with that process of recollection wow
yes anamnesis right or even active re-memorying right like like new memorying right the revision the
recollection the revision the revivification the resurrection all of these things and you know
spelling i mean what are we kidding like literally are you feel like oh that's an accident no that's not
accidental the idea of casting a spell and spelling are intimately interwoven in the origins of the
possibilities of writing which were in some cases detested by certain philosophers socrates among them
also if jesus existed never wrote anything many other mythic figures and messianic figures wrote nothing
that we know of ever of course we don't know whether they wrote or not but yeah so you can see how
technology is anathema to memory in a certain sense because the the originally symbolic gesture
um that was wedded to this object needed to be eclipsed for it to acquire what we call use
or utility wow okay say that again and say more about that articulate that further please that's powerful
yeah so over the course of the development of our language as with the development of our technology
we lose these originally cosmogonic connections within the symbols that i think were originally perceived
in our environment um they become these deadened structures whether you know technical objects or written
language yeah or generalizations within contemporary language which are these after images of
original symbols so so in other words the symbol functions by moving from the one to the many whereas
the process of generalization in our language moves from the many to the one so we think that concepts
encompass what different objects have in common so we think of like in platonism you know the everyday reading
of platonism is that the form of the chair is that which every chair somehow has in common but that
generalization i think is is mistaken what i think plato meant was something more like a symbol
just present in our environment wow okay even in the goethean sense sure yeah so sure yeah like what goethe
was observing in the metamorphosis of a living organism was the presence of this unity something symbolic that
assumed a manifold guise so okay so it's a it was originally a percept it was something that you could
see with your with your with your anatomy it was present within your waking vision yeah
yeah symbols weren't abstractions they were persons
so then it would be it would be as if there's a um
yeah language was originally a perceptive vehicle it was it was supposed to facilitate certain images
it still does in two degree yeah it's just it's very degraded i think um
okay so the the animal let us say the uh for example the salamander
is an exemplar of something meta to the salamander itself yes yeah which the salamander is
enacting acting out embodying bringing to life in forming right uh and so but
where then because certainly i don't think you suspect that the the concept of the place where
the platonic forms exist is real i don't think you think that way at all where does the the the
metaphor that the salamander is
being where is that thing i think at least in part it belongs to the past
yeah so i think it indwells the flow of time oh wow okay that's beautiful it indwells the flow of time
yeah so an organism i think is the reappearance of something that really belongs to the past
so a portion of the past reappears as a whole unit so the same process i think takes place within our
perception so that was why i was espousing direct realism some time ago um say more about direct
realism give us a little sketch of walnut shell version and so we can understand what you mean by
this phrase yeah so i mean direct realism is fairly straightforward um direct realism is simply the idea
that when you perceive your environment um there are two you know fundamental
beings you and your environment right as opposed to some third medium so modern science tends to approach
the act of perception in uh in the fashion of like indirect realism so the idea that some mediating
process separates your perception from the physical world direct realism would be the idea that there
is no third term there is no third entity that separates me or cleaves me from the world so it's more
participatory it's yeah it's i mean that's uh fascinating and confusing because it seems to me
from my experience of language and concepts that they they almost form the third medium that actually
divides me in my mind from you and the world and my experience and all these things and produces this
overlay or underlay or interlay of abstractions and uh uh what would i call them figures of identity and so
forth which are certainly confused possibly lethal in the sense of the causal of forgetting right um
but i can see how that's not necessarily the third thing i can you know imagine that that's not
necessarily a a third thing yeah right one of the there's so much here to explore um so
when you said something that resembles
the
that which is expressed as the salamander indwells in the past in the flow of time
say more help us understand what what it's like to indwell in the flow of time yeah so what i think
takes place in the development of the living system is the red integration or the recovery
or the reappearance of some portion of the past as a whole so what was once something like a part
reappears as something like a whole so i think in terms of these part whole relationships within what
we call the flow of time because i regard the flow of time as an indivisible motion so i think that
sort of like a wave like a wave like structure so could one imagine um
would it be mistaken in your view or confused to imagine just for the sake of visualization the flow of
time is something resembling a tube in which there are strands that elaborate and re-emerge
i think you're going to say no but say whatever you're going to say tubes yeah i'm just trying to
visualize something and i know it's gonna it's not going to work well right i'm expecting to fail
but um like a tunnel a complex array of tunnels and intersecting tubes one of which becomes salamanders in
the future presuming you know linearity and all of that except yeah we we both know that i think
we both at least strongly suspect if it's not true that we know that whatever time is doing it's not
a linear set of right it's doing something very crazy where it's like expanding i don't know expanding
to both the beginning of the past and the end of the future and then coming back to the moment and then
and then and then being expressed in the moment somehow and then transforming both the past and
the future when it expands again and something like that i don't even i have no idea how to
conceptualize it maybe you could help me yeah well i mean my perception of this environment um
i might claim is an integral whole so my my very perception of my surroundings itself is a kind of
whole unit that contains certain ratios or harmonies that themselves reflect these broader
cosmic holes so so in other words in the same way that my perception of my environment is an integral
whole integral holes appear as objects within my perception whether it's organisms or
a certain physical phenomena yeah books books kind of support the idea right because they weren't written
now the author is not here right so the past is re-emerging in the present and is is re-presenced
as the book in a way yeah so i basically you know reject the idea that time could be divided
into qualitatively homogeneous segments so once you reject the idea that time can be partitioned into
you know like immobile slices slices little boxes you know at least i come to the conclusion that what
manifests is always reflective of the past so the past never ceases to exist the past is something that
perpetually streams into the present so in a certain sense you might say that i only ever perceive
something which is already past i think that makes sense okay yeah but what appears as the present is
really just a portion of the past that instantiates itself as a whole so it works like memory i don't
think you that all makes sense to me but i don't think you actually mean the word portion do you
do you do you no right i just wanted to make sure because that's just that um you mean a feature or
something yeah a characteristic or a complex of relational situational structural elements
right that recur yeah please continue so in the body of a plant for example a stem leaf
itself is the reappearance of something that indwells the past which might look radically
unlike what i think the stem leaf looks like but then as you progress from the stem leaf to the supple
you can see how the stem leaf undergoes a certain logical transformation which provides the foundation
for the pedal so do you mean a logical transformation or a structural re-expression i see it as a logical
process a logical process you say more about like language sure same okay uh to help me understand how
what you mean by it being a logical process uh what does the word logical mean for you in that description
i'm not trying to put you on the spot just help me to see it means something like rational
so like in the pythagorean sense of ratio yeah so so the logos as a partitioning or rational principle
is what i mean um to relationally partition in such a fashion as to conserve and elaborate
features of both elements in the ratio yeah so the appearance of any phenomenon presupposes
that in which it stands in a relation in relation yes so it only ever exists as a relation which is
i think somewhat similar to process philosophy yeah but by that i mean something like ratio or logic
a structured relation between aspects or elements yes yeah don't even put words in your mouth by all
means correct me if i if i get it wrong the spatiality of a stem leaf reflects the spatiality of its
concomitant
neighbors basically so the so the spatial juxtaposition of the parts of the body of a flower is an integral whole
so the extent to which a stem leaf appears in space ultimately reflects the spatiality of other
components so that so by that i mean something that's what i mean by logical so you can actually
you can you can perform arithmetic by by looking at certain proportions of its body in the same way
that you can perform arithmetic by analyzing light
it it's i think it's it's it's quite a lot of this that's very dangerous thing to say i think
well that's how i think that's how i think arithmetic was originally done i know but it wasn't
yeah it wasn't it wasn't a graphical process i know your your mind is like a thing from another universe
and fascinating and informative to behold but i mean some of the perspectives you have are unlike
anything i've encountered anything even resembling and i've seen some you know unusual transformations
of intelligence and insight and perspective and concern um
yeah plato didn't believe in writing anything i mean that's not what plato meant by geometry
right by geometry plato meant something within optics he was talking about something within
light itself really say more yeah i mean don't leave us there sure yeah let's just you let the
ramp to the ship down now let's walk let's go up and board the ship please sure so i mean for the
ancient greeks geometry appears to have been a general theory of perception that was wedded to
extremitism or the idea that the eye emits light which now we think is
somewhat dubious we think you know we're enlightened but no i mean yeah that's very punny have you
please continue in the light right yeah i mean i've heard you say very astonishing things like that relate
to uh okay so first of all let's be very clear about something um whether or not we can determine
whether or not the eyes emit light it seems that we can determine that beings are sensitive to observation
even when they cannot see that they are being observed observation from behind and so forth and so
whether or not the eyes actually emit photons or something light waves it seems clear that the ancient
greek and probably they were not the only people to make this discovery we just happen to know about
them because they were writing a lot and they left records but um it seems very clear that the gaze
that would that are that are seeing um can have meant a broad array of different characters and it is as if
it is touching and or caressing or penetrating or tapping on things that we see they are affected by
being seen we are affected by seeing they are affected by being seen and so the one reasonable metaphor
is the metaphor of touching right our seeing touches in a sense that was how the ancient atomists thought
a vision yes perhaps play to itself yes um and you had said something i found very fascinating about
the possibility that um ancient people creating the things that we understand as cave paintings
might have been relating with something like feedback please continue it was today yeah i mean as far as i can
tell plato was simply transmitting or perpetuating a much more ancient spiritual discipline that potentially i
think you can find in paleolithic k bar yeah so um so what plato meant by geometry involved something like
becoming conscious of the extent to which your eyes emit light so that process of becoming conscious
was i think originally wedded to the acquisition of self-knowledge because
phosphenes essentially reveal three-dimensional projections of your own brain activity so by
meditating on phosphenes as far as i can tell plato was attempting to transmit this esoteric discipline
whereby you could acquire information about your own essence or your own anatomy at the very least origin nature
purposive uh you know um aura i don't know what the right word is purposive
nature this is one thing i can say but it's not just plato right not by a long shot no all right so
let's let's be clear humans have been aware of this long plato inherited this knowledge i mean he may have had um
some uh relatively novel and or personal and or unique insight but he had many teachers we must imagine
among them some extremely brilliant minds um and also although he has not spoken yet at length about it
and then it's something i hope to ask him about almond hillman has talked about this uh greek concept ops
from which i think we get ophthalmology and things which is the power of the gaze and the eye to
transfix to caress to transform to capture to instruct all of these things these are active powers of the
gaze they're not receptive right they're magical powers of the gaze that he refers to with this uh three
letter root oops i think it's oops not ops and clearly he is aware and utilizes some feature of this in his own
um relationships with people sure yeah yeah no i mean the connection between geometry and megalithic
constructions obviously perceived plato so right and the cave paintings by you know hundreds of thousands
fifty thousand years who knows what yeah yeah some cave work so my suspicion is that these megalithic
constructions were transplantations of the environment of the cave to the surface in order to bridge
this gap between this acoustic theory and this optical theory so there was this kind of process whereby
the cave was moved to the surface in order for the cave to interact with um stellar light or with
sunlight and sound and sound and sound yeah right okay here even for the pythagoreans acoustics was
originally wedded to geometry yeah as it was yeah as it is for us in theory particularly uh
the aspects of physics that have to do with with sound and frequency and so forth um
okay let's see here okay so again we find in the cave the reiteration of the principle of the womb
right the power of the womb as encompassing protective primordial magical metaphysical um both
yeah yeah you have birth you have like conception right birth life death and resurrection all happening in this
feminine cavity right this was chthonically feminine cavity in this case right uh which perhaps they imagined
space to be the super
help me out yeah well descending into the cave is analogous to rising into outer space right so those two
seemingly contrary motions are really one of the same so by by descending into the cave you're really becoming
an astronaut yeah so it's so amazing because yeah it should have been obvious i don't think it is obvious
to moderns it was certainly obvious to ingo swan that you didn't need a spaceship traveling space right
because he right went and looked at um at least in his book penetration he discusses uh getting the idea to
remote view jupiter which was laughed at by the project people until he threatened to leave and
they're like okay okay you know go ahead try this and then um as his claimed in his book anyway many of the
reports that he made about certain features of jupiter about 15 in a row all of them were later
validated by the observations of the voyager probe which was then en route or close to jupiter
um and uh was some some of the um remote observations he made were validated much later
uh by other by other means according to him um
yeah the universe would be a sad and tragic place if indeed to travel in it required machines
so would our you know so too our relationships are destroyed um now not only destroyed right like you
and i met by the ages of machines um but uh you know it's it's a sad and tragic situation when
our relational interactions are reduced to those that are can only you know can only be carried by machines
right because the richness of in person like in meat space presence is very profound number one number
two the kinds of intimacies that arise prosper are mutually curated and nurtured as two people who
adore each other are pulled apart over a distance roomie and his lover for example um what was the name
i can't remember naps what was his name i can't remember what he called his lover um or that man's name but uh
i myself have experienced very transcendental modes of intimacy due to the imposition of distance and
without the imposition of machines right so you know the mother who senses that her son is in trouble
just before he calls her right and uh tells her husband you know something's wrong where is thomas
you know and then she finds out that indeed there is there's some problem hopefully a resolvable one
um yes the intimacies okay this is a whole other topic which is that humans seem to suppose
but distance equals separation when in many cases there are many forms of distance and modes of relation over distance
where greater distance equals greater intimacy not lesser intimacy as we suppose and this brings us
back to something that i just want to tap on briefly from this morning when we were talking
we were looking at a very elaborate stone on the ground that's quite beautiful and probably worth
absolutely nothing i mean as a piece of garden sculpture it might be worth some money because
it's huge and colorful and hard to transport but we are trained to only value those things that are
culturally or commercially valued by humans so that if i were to find a large diamond i would get very
excited if i were to find a chunk of gold i would very get very excited but if we have actual
intelligent insight and that was active in our minds then we would understand we would be imbued i think
with an originary active sense of real value that is not based on representations or commodities
but is based on some sort of participatory sensing and intimacy with the environment history the future
the people that the organisms the sky right all of these things would combine to produce a kind of a
a system of value that we could actually trust because it's not based on abstractions or
bullshit or lies or fictions or authorities or war or commerce or money or you know whatever kind of
trafficking in occlusion that has become dominant and popular around here
yeah so anything you wish to add or yeah i mean our idea of measurement i think is
is flawed yeah that'd be putting it mildly yeah and certainly the measurement of like value what's
important right not only do we get that wrong a lot we're getting it wrong as a species in such a way
that could put an end to the history and future of this world yeah so that's a pretty big mistake you
it's basically can't make a bigger mistake you can end the entire you put an end to the entire history
and meaning of measurement right now right just put an end to it right there's no more of that around
here ever again if you make you know the wrong kinds of moves wrong kinds of measurements your values
are skewed enough but they get everybody killed yes right one of our presuppositions i think is that
space is easily computable we can easily subordinate space to some kind of common metric
not like distance right so we can superimpose graph paper upon our perception of space in some
you know easy fashion um yeah i totally reject that paradigm so okay so it's interesting when you say
things like that because what i hear is a kind of a a moral emotional aesthetic and intellectual
revulsion right like this is disgusting why are you people doing that wrong thing right and that's very
profound um i think it is moral yeah i think but it's also it's it's intellectually aesthetic and
philosophically aesthetic you know it's wrong you fundamentally sense like this this is a bad thing
you know right um and i'm capable of similar concerns and insights but i usually i usually admit
i have a little special box in which i keep the the things that i'm going to call this little box
the things the humans do right i have this little box and i recognize that the humans do these things and
i i validate them to the degree that the humans do them and they make machines with them and things
um but i don't hold them as fundamentally authoritative and i do disagree with a lot of the purposes for
which humans do any like humans qua are the species or the the collective you know monstrous
collectives of corporations the military industrial complex governments whatever you know just name
name the monsters and they're doing insane things with the findings of science and measurement
but yeah please continue about the problem with measurement and the graph the grid the three
dimensional graph paper that they put everywhere and it was like oh yeah there's a planet here so the
graph paper bends and that causes the light to bend right and so forth yeah i mean our fixation on
graph paper is really just bounded with our fixation on perimeter rising phenomena controlling phenomena the
rectangles domesticating phenomena yeah the rectangles yeah yeah like it's like swarming you know rectangles
so the bookshelves the books the carpet the bed the door the windows the squares in the windows the the
the camera we're filming this on the the video that will be produced by is all you know bounded with
angles yeah this kind of neurotic fix fixation on control and predictability grasping yes yes underpins
our whole concept of science and therefore scientific knowledge also ownership um which is the weirdest idea
one of the things i find hilarious is when i hear commentators saying things like um
you know those ufos are invading our airspace and i'm like wait a minute our airspace i understand that
concept in relation to like china right if china was to overfly our airspace or something but ufos
like what did what are people thinking like we own space we own chunks of space time that we have a right
to you know get really angry if anything goes through there like birds are invading our airspace we should
just shoot those down you know we're not in control of those birds we do shoot them down we burn them
down with wires conducting electricity for our machines and things by the millions per hour or something
yeah oh yeah yeah i read an article earlier um birds are starting wildfires by being caught on fire by
electrical wires and just flaming out and i mean those damn birds why why do they keep starting those
fires that way right no space i think is fundamentally um anisotropic so as opposed to regarding space as a
uniform medium like a container which would be totally neutral with respect to movement or you know how it
might be populated by objects i regard space as more of a plural phenomenon so as opposed to regarding
space as a monolithic container space i think actually changes as you progress through it or move through
it i mean i would go much further and say that um all the natural phenomena that we observe here
on earth that we participate with actually let me put that a different way and that we ourselves
are formed in with and from these are expressions of the nature character origin temperament and
uh perhaps even purposive spirit of time space yeah right precisely and and and so if there are other
worlds in time space naturally i do okay we probably differ in this i do sort of conceive of it as a
container okay so that i imagine that if very distantly there's another star or another planet with life
forms on it right it would be impossible for this planet to be entirely separate from that one these two
planets would be exchanging uh what i might think of as they'd be in a kind of a conversation that would
inform the structure character activity and behavior of the organisms so that in a sense
in the same way every island in the ocean is unique right yet they are all islands in the ocean and so
although you may find unique life forms on different islands
you find the same kind you find expressions of the same fundamental lexicon so to speak of life right
and so i like to think and in fact i i feel it's very likely that this is so but perhaps you just call
that a bias or belief that all of the forms we see here are indicative of the nature of time space
and life on other worlds in other words everything you can find in time space you can find right here
right yeah i agree with that it's not just some little floating speck in a vast morass of emptiness
and weirdness and nebulae and stuff that have nothing to do with us right we are the important thing
that stuff out there is just all unknown that's a bizarre idea um in an if you know the ancients if
they conceived of i'm fascinatedly curious to understand what it was like to walk out under the
living sky 50 000 years ago as a human and just look up and what did they participatorily perceive
there because it certainly wasn't anything like what we what we are mostly i think we're just living
in a catastrophic deprivation that's conceptual and bizarre mind-breaking occlusive heartbreaking
but yeah let's i've been blabbering on long enough i don't know that makes sense um
the actual goal of science i think is to uncover the unit of measurement that ought to be used in order to
fully comprehend a being or a phenomenon so implicit in the appearance of a being or a phenomenon is the
unit of measurement that ought to be used to render it intelligible wow so by applying this external
you know qualitatively homogeneous unit we actually eclipse or occlude or
uh conceal something which is truly essential which would be the actual object of scientific
investigation okay that's that's what i'm yes yes yes beautiful beautiful um i think that might be
confusing to some listeners because when when you say the um the unit of measurement
they're going to think you mean something like a number and you don't i mean something like what i
was called a form yeah so the form is the actual unit yeah yeah measurement and maybe even a symbol
yes that's right okay so this yeah i think i'm it's very difficult to move into the condominium of your
mind ridiculous uh metaphor there but the um the spatialization of your of your thought uh instantaneously
but i'm dragging myself slowly in that direction and i just want to ask you straight up which you know
may be a little bit of a cheating question here do you suppose perhaps that john d's that symbol
has anything to do with this topic i think so say more i mean i can only you know speak for my intuition
of course but from what i can gather john d was trying to elaborate a certain kind of cosmogony whereby
light descends into matter which i can understand in my own sense not hard for me to grasp that yeah
so i mean that that's still sort of also uh arthur young in his reflexive universe proposes a very
similar idea the guy who solved the mechanical problems resulting in usable helicopters which are
sort of a nightmare on earth but nonetheless a very significant engineering problem yeah please continue
i mean just the relationship between light and matter is something that preoccupies me
that's why i find john d of interest because he was um really a scholar of ancient greek geometry and
the greek language so i think he probably has some insight this book that you recently acquired uh what
sparked i i understand that there's a historical thread here that leads you to seek this book and to become
excited about uh finding it to talk about the book a little bit and you're interested in what you
have come to understand about it the monus hieroglyphica yes yeah so i mean the monus hieroglyphica
is simply a book that explains a symbol that john d constructed which appears to have been bound up with
the history of rosicrucianism so i think it recurs within the rosicrucian manifestos uh so my interest
in rosicrucianism is you know just generally related to my interest in the history of science and
mechanical philosophy uh people like francis bacon or john locke right because from my perspective modern
science actually arose in the context of attempting to communicate with angels if you actually look
at the history of you know why people like leibnitz were interested in developing theories of computation
or you know why john locke uh introduced this distinction between primary qualities and secondary
qualities in his theory of knowledge it was related to recovering the adamic language so
it was related to communicating with angels basically so the reason that we have computers
here today is really downstream from those rosicrucian developments so that's my answer say something
about what you imagine the adamic language to be um so what does this phrase mean for you how do you think
about it so when i think about you know the adamic language i think about what underpins this connection
that i mentioned between mythology technology and sound symbolism because if you look at the kabbalah
at least i see traces of sound symbolism oh yes you know the idea of using speech to influence material
creation like the goal you know for example so the creation of the golem in the kabbalah was really
connected connected to certain kinds of annunciations which themselves were connected to drawing down
astral influences from like celestial spheres which you can find corollaries to in greek philosophy i think so
yes as i was yeah sort of mentioned also incantation yes invocation evocation
um and vastly older uh things like the ikaros of the south american indigenous people and the
probably should be called something other than songs but the songs of
uh ancient indigenous peoples and even modern indigenous peoples you know there are songs that are still
enacted and these songs always accompany the activation
the direction the not the direction of forces and powers that are not human right and it's very interesting um
um in atza moitskan which is the morning uh speaking to
the beings and the world and history in the future is my way of saying it i'll take responsibility for that
it's the morning what we would think of as a ceremony a cleansing prayer something like this in in atza moitskan
um one does not request things one speaks them into factual existence there's no like please help me
nothing like that it's it's and it's not commandment either right if we were to describe it we would say
you command the in english you might say that but that's not i don't think that's what it is and also the songs
they do the thing you're talking about in time they draw the past into this moment and and
remake it here now changing this moment and the past and the future by this process of
relational intimacy acknowledgement recollection and amnesis active all these things active together
in this sort of manifold right that restructures the meaning and identity and relationships in this moment
and you know we have this word magic which is a very strange idea um compared to what i think our
distant ancestors knew experienced and were up to they weren't casting spells in the way that we think
about it at all um i don't even know what this casting idea comes from fishing or something i mean
uh but yeah so so these are some of the things that i think of and also the it's very important that in
in many um old and and still existing cultures there's these features that we would call initiation
but then blackfoot for example and i don't have any rights to speak about blackfoot just to be clear
i mean i'm talking about something that has become that i've become aware of through the auspices
of my friend right first diaper um but there's something called transfer which changes a person
introduces and connects them with the with that stream in time
and and and transforms their interiority and their i think it was their spirit or something
something new arises in them they become participatory in this long stream so to speak
and literally my experience anyway is that undergoing that process of transfer even a simple transfer
what happens is the beings along the whole timeline come to you and check you out right they're like
so this guy's joining our family okay let's see what what's going on with this guy in a vast
ceremonial thing that is inexplicably profound and beautiful uh and alive in a way that it's very
difficult for us to understand as moderns a living way right right oath
yeah i don't even know active and amnoetic
momenta right right something like this yeah i think language was originally that very process of
recollecting to recollect as you enunciate yes that's yeah yes very different because i mean obviously
what's what um aristotle i think was upset about is it aristotle maybe it was socrates i can't remember
one of them was complaining fiercely about writing and uh the complaint was something like
you know you're going to have people walking around with no experience of something
they're going to be talking about it as if they're masters of it there was no transfer of knowledge
from one human from one being to another the process of transfer gone now they just have a scroll
that they read and then they they ape mastery and expertise and intimacy and and so on and of course this
is in the context where you have like the rapsodes right you can come along and just directly
manipulate your emotions on purpose some beautifully but some nefariously too and then you have the sophists
which are even scarier right these are people who just uh manipulate the features of rhetoric and
language in such a way as to entrap or directly control or um enchant or blind or um successfully
weave fictions for the sake of you know power or money or law or whatever the master the sort of
retort the masters of the rhetorical uh catalog right um artful with speech but uncaring about truth
or virtue or relational integrity right just using the language um whatever whatever you have
yeah i mean sophistry is about winning yes exactly yeah winning okay which is about war yes and also
you know domination and you know you can always invent a better weapon right you can just keep
inventing a more powerful weapon once that's your goal yeah you can almost see though where writing
originated in these caves so yes yes um repetitions of of form tropes of form perhaps in light and
angry shadow yeah so essentially as the master marks his phosphenes or her phosphenes upon the wall
his or her student can absorb some of you know their power oh wow yeah yeah much like a mandala right so
so so the master through meditation projects an image of his own brain activity which you know he might observe
but which his student can also absorb so this kind of transmission i think was really at the basis of
perhaps writing wow so in other words they were reading each other uh like a mind melt it was some kind of
like transmission of yeah this these images were catalytic in that relationship yeah right uh they were
powerful charged they drew the minds together in a sense uh in a kind of visual agreement the the master
projects okay so let's be really clear as we didn't say this earlier master is having phosphenic
imagery inside the cave then records that imagery marks it okay and then others come and they receive
that imagery and it's imbued with power that transforms it's not just they see things
they're not just looking at like this like the way we do right right they're having a
a non-ordinary experience of the imposition of these images into some feature of their consciousness
that we may not even have right we may have been born bereft of this feature of mind and probably are
because the ancients were having experiences of consciousness we don't have i'm certain of this
and it wasn't just because they're making up right they're not just like oh they're superstitious
you know you can imagine um there's i think there was even a show about this you can imagine
in the future people are born blind and no one has any eyes and they read all this stuff about seeing
and stuff and they're like those people were just making there's no such thing seeing what you're
talking about like and then somebody's born they can see and starts to and they kill them and because
everything around their culture you know i think it was a show similar to this but you can imagine the
trope without the show right yeah and i think we are like that in terms of certainly our capacity to
participate in uh relation and experience and our capacity to you know we're really good at abstract
concepts making little maps and cutting things apart putting them back together in other forms
but that's a tragic impoverishment compared to immediate relational intimacy like mind sharing
not just telepathy but mutual the mutual formation of of mental space that we can both play and develop in
and this kind of thing right yeah um the cave paintings yes yes oh yeah so the theriomorphs
right these are not necessarily okay yeah say whatever you want to talk about the theory i want to hear
your perspective well one imagines that if you're having phosphenes okay oh okay so the other night
a couple nights ago i had a dream that i talked to you about right where i met this woman and what she
did was she explained she was a sort of a counselor therapist type very uh intuitively brilliant and she
would help people find their animals and and they were stored in their back right the animals were stored in
their back yeah um and wow so it's so tricky when you turn your head up slightly the blue window appears
in both of your oh yeah man that's nuts yeah that's just crazy um brilliant it because it's sort of like
what we're talking about right like there's a reflection on this pain and it's making me
feel something very different about what sort of a being is in front of me when i see that reflection
in the pain of the glasses um all right so we were speaking earlier and i said to you that
that the vision that toy maker made my mind to see of not just time space but that which is from which
time space arises as a sort of a a flowing intelligent intelligent fluid reflection of this origin space
right i'll call it origin which is outside of time um that the universe is basically a a universe
city and also a university and also a living library where the books read themselves to you
like they and this is what has happened to me i've had this experience like with the wasp right when it
dumped what i felt was the entire history of its people into my mind over the course of a few seconds
and and i and i i experienced that history as myself right i became that history it wasn't like
something was shown to me it was like i unforgot the entire history of the wasps since their inception
on this world as my own being and so you can imagine ancients having this experience regularly
and not thinking of themselves as humans at all what would they think of themselves as something we
can't imagine and whatever we've been told to think of ourselves as is most certainly wrong and
completely deprived of like i don't know 98 of what we are can be we're meant to be you know are for
and all these things so i'm sorry i'm getting a little bit excited but the catastrophic lying
bullshit impoverishment of you're a human being and you're glad and blah you know you manipulate devices
with your fingers guns buddy and you know computers and stuff um what i mean you might as well just like
snip off all our limbs and you know take them to the wall and then tell complex mechanical stories about
help me out please like i'm losing here but i just want to i'll finish up so
each of the beings and forms in the universe is is both a unique array of
forms of intelligence memory and relation i don't they are like i'll make i'll go ahead and use the
metaphor of living books okay but they're not books because they're not records they're transcendental
to the concept of book in 50 different ways but i'll go ahead and use that concept and so one of
the things i find fascinating about you is that you are doing the thing that the universe is being you
are like a living library a universe city which is also a university and i think there's something
truly noble about that and beautiful and profound um enchanting uh yeah all of these things and so
that's a lot of why i think it's really important for us to make recordings like this so that we can
both have the opportunity to explore each other's thought and concern and perception but also to
to read ourselves to the other beings and to read each other to the other into the other beings
and so what i think was happening is that the living world was reading itself into the ancients and
then they were they were enlightening the reading onto the cave walls and then the people were receiving
the enlightenment from the cave walls and being transformed and and being and now noisized right like
being un being actively imbued with waves iterative waves of unforgetting that echoed and expanded over
time like a heartbeat that's like beating in nine new ways every time it beats in their mind in their
in their spirit in their heart in their relationships in their relationships with the sky each other the earth a
stone the animal the plants the food um the shelter the predators the all of this thing yeah yeah
something like this yeah but we got lucky to be able to remember or see something even vaguely
similar to what we've managed here today i think yeah i think so i feel lucky finally yeah for sure
sure i'm very lucky um would you like to pause here shall we continue how are you feeling um i feel
fine i could keep going but let's keep going then well you can see in a paleolithic cave art certain
relationships between animals which i think is also highly significant um so like depictions of human
human beings tend to be wispy they tend to be ephemeral like ghosts which i think is important to consider
but between france and spain the most common pairing of animals is that between the horse
and the orcs or the bison uh basically the ruminant right um which appears to have reflected this
this primeval dyad between the masculine and feminine that agriculture preserved in this roundabout way
um so understanding that relationship i think is is illuminating because animals themselves were seen
as relations not simply as you know objects or you know beings in our everyday sense absolutely uh it's
i mean a long time ago now there's certain transformations of lexicon that
okay if you don't have them they're crippling right and if you can recorrect certain root ideas
in the lexicon it ends up correcting a whole array of other ideas so one of those root elements that i
call holophores um everything vehicle because there's like a ring of holophores right it's like world
animal mother friend dream food all these things right and and damage to any one of these
is inherited by all the others so as science and mechanism and uh uh reductionism as it rips our
lexicons to shreds and throw like eviscerates connotative aspects of root concepts like world
person mother dream food friend animal you know tree plant water ocean all these things if you damage one
of those the damage spreads around them and similarly if you repair any one of those that repair is
spread to all the others they're linked together in a sort of superstructure that we can't see
and then um the last i'm going to stop lecturing about that in a second but um
there's also this problem of what i call the super container which is the thing from which each of the
the holophores descends and then the lexicon is sort of inside the ring of the holophores so damage
to that damages every every element in the lexicon repairs to those things repair every element in the
lexicon and one of the earliest repairs that i ever experienced which might seem you know
a little bit trivial at first glance but wildly isn't is that the organisms are peoples
right when i first realized like oh those are peoples just like we are peoples the the whales are peoples
the bees are people the the mice they are people right um when i realized that it changed everything
i was capable of thinking right and and this is how repairs to holophores work this is a technology we
can actually enact it's not just some theory right you can do this you can change what tree means
and that will change everything for you in part because human language knowledge measurement science
all these things they're based on a tree structure right so you change what a tree means
you change the mapping structure you're using to orient yourself in language and conceptual space
yeah um and one of the you know one of the simplest transformations of tree that happened for me
and this is in my mid to late 20s i started trying to understand what are trees doing what are they
doing you know what are they being and so i started asking the trees and eventually it just emerged in my
mind that they were like drawing down the energies and intelligences of the sky
integrating and transforming them transmitting them into the earth drawing all the intelligences and
transformations of the earth up into themselves transmitting them into the sky right this sort of
you know unit bridging the two worlds without which you got nothing you got nothing right and this so i
realized oh they are beings they are people they are living antenna they are in touch with all of the
intelligences they integrate them they transform them they transmit them they gather them together
they transform them they transmit them and then once you have this idea you can sort of do the
same i mean you're not that different yourself okay just show you something kind of weird about
yourself for a moment you have these things we call feet right and mostly you keep them in darkness
don't you they're not just exposed to the light all the time at least not around here and you know
yeah that's for protecting your feet from damage and things like that especially in a technological space
but notice we kind of keep them dark as if they were underground right then we have this other thing
which like we reach up to the sky right with our with our hands open and we we call something into
ourselves and we transform it we eat the food we transform it the trees uh don't eat the light
but they transform the light so there are all these things and these are transformations of holophores
that i can directly easily demonstrate there's lots of others what's a dream what's a friend
mother all these things right where you can repair the lost associations and connotations
so that the complexity of the definition is fundamentally transformed into consciousness
in a way it's very unlikely to ever be undone right and that is a kind of a healing of the
linguistic semantic and psycho relation psycholinguistic features of our relationship
with language and concepts that i think is crucially important it's something i believe very deeply in
um but yeah the animals are peoples and so one of the ways to think of the humans it's not the only way
but i like it is we are the animal that can become the summation lens right for all the other beings
and this isn't because we're made special or because we are the dominant or best thing what it is
is is a sort of a gift right that is that is the the the the the privilege or inheritance of our of of the
entire biosphere lifting us up to this position to become perhaps its avatar and representative and i
think the ancients were aware of this and honored it and felt like humble and emotionally profound about
this gift and protected it and treasured it and knew it was precious and wouldn't give it up would rather
died and give then give up their felt sense of of of god where's the word of this
i can't find the word in my vocabulary this transmission right this gift this privilege this
thing they must fulfill i can't find the word
and so this is part of what the theriomorphs were about right we are all the we are all the people
we are the all people people right and maybe similarly they are the all people people too right they are the
animal heat like we are the the theriomorphs and they are the morio and they are the morio ants
right or something like this yeah i suspect as much yeah because i've heard um in black there's a
blackfoot story where uh in a certain critical situation one of the the sort of heroes i keep
using the word sword and i'll stop that one of the heroes um is taken to the city of the animal people
and this is the place where the animals
they are theriomorphs they are they are like humans with animal faces and heads and things
and they are people and there's something that the person is never supposed to do that they are warned
not this it's something like don't accept a gift don't accept a gift and they're going to try to give you
presents you mustn't accept the presence when you're there right you can't accept them there you can
accept them outside if they give you presents or something like this which is very important because
the animals give us gifts they make offerings to us and we can you know we can do something similar
um for them but yeah so what are uh what are your thoughts about the theriomorphs and the
the images that we see obviously many of the images in the cave paintings have to do with moons
like uh uh counting moons counting moon cycles they have to do with transfer moons transformation of
weather over moons transformation of um perhaps food sources and or animals over the moons
um they have to do with transformation moons and transformations of things in the sky
over the moons uh and often those are circular things or even spiraling things
because i've seen i don't i'm not trying to say all of these things are this but this is
not uncommonly seen in k paintings right well i mean i personally suspect that the horse was
was regarded as an embodiment of the sky or the wind whereas the ruminant like the bison was regarded as
an embodiment of the earth so there was this kind of interplay which you can see even in their so-called
symbols so there are 32 symbols that are found throughout caves between uh you know france and spain
um those symbols have been uh investigated by a number of people but they they seem to align
fairly well with what ian the gilchrist of all people um identifies in terms of like how split
brain patients render images with their hands wow okay um people who've undergone commiserotomy
yes and or people who have undergone the wada procedure which is no longer legal right where
you anesthetize one side of the brain yeah wow okay i'm with you so the so the horse bison pairing
is interesting because horses stand on one toe whereas bison stand on two toes wow so this kind of
pairing i think is significant because it it broadly aligns with these two classes of so-called
symbols in these caves which are either expanding or contracting which ian the gilchrist like i said
managed to map to the two hemispheres of the brain so um yeah so i have a lot of suspicions about that but
i'll leave it there i suppose like essentially i suspect that that writing originated in the context of this
this lateralization process or some kind of metacognition of that process
and there were these cosmic corollaries or environmental corollaries
one of the most profound things that ever occurred to me and it's not like i thought these things up on
my own i feel like they were given to me like they were impressed upon me rather than like oh these are
darren's inventions isn't he you know creatively imagined it's not what's going on at all sometimes
maybe but not this one so when the non-human intelligence was with me in the first time and
i was inquiring into the origins of language and writing it gave me this vision of like a primordial
creature just making a mark with its claw or its tooth on the tree and the realization that that would allow
the creature's spirit or intention to be encoded in light and cross time into other minds
so this is a mind transiting this is like a spaceship that uses light to cross the space between minds
right this mark the claw mark on the tree doesn't have to be a letter right tells every creature that
sees it something about who was here what did they mean what am i supposed to get you know like there's a
transmission that happens across the light across time across space across different bodies this is very
profound this is shocking right we we take these things for granted we just make marks on paper you
know it's no big deal wrong um those marks on paper connect minds that are dead minds to living minds
think about that right this is not trivial and similarly the the cave painting something similar
except we don't know how to receive the transmission anymore we for most of us i think have forgotten
yeah there must be those of us who haven't forgotten or have spent their life i think i i think
i read something about someone like this right who spent i think it was a man his entire life just
trying to trying to trying to learn to receive what had been what was being transmitted and had been
and the capacity for the reception of had been lost thoughts yeah well the the different symbols seem to
map fairly well to phosphine patterns so that seems like a pretty promising lead to me
um some kind of feedback mechanism yeah that that appears to have been the origin of right
as far as i can tell okay so let's be really clear what you're saying about that so that other people
can understand i think you once said that um under the influence of a certain substance
of your vision when you looked at it for example an object you're seeing it sort of contract and
expand right yeah and then and what did you come to surmise from that so yeah perception involves this
kind of dynamic equilibrium between filtration and feedback so perception is a kind of interplay between
two fundamentally distinct processes so what happens during meditation or during psychedelic experiences
is that you can become conscious through feedback of your own motor activity so you can become conscious
of something in your environment which is really part of your own anatomy so what you see is expansion and
contraction in your environment is really reflective of your own pupillary action for example so you see
externally something which is truly internal so i think it actually arises because ordinarily our
consciousness involves certain filters which are removed under you know special circumstances or inhibited
inhibited or transformed how they're filtering or what they're filtering yes right yeah or even the
frequency of the filtering over some you know span um presuming that spans exist so the activity of the eye
becomes perceptible to the eye itself right so you start seeing these patterns and shapes yes so a
common experience of people under the influence of psychedelics is that the the landscape starts to sort of breathe
right they call it breathing and that's often part of the onset of what's going to become a much more
more so much more intense uh transformation of the visual field um but that breathing is probably feedback
from the disinhibition of filters yeah right when when we when we first started uh measuring i don't know
actually i'm going to rephrase that um in some research that attempted to to do mris of people's brains
under the influence of i think psilocybin um many some neuroscientists were expecting that we would see
uh hyperactivation of various parts of the brain and if i understand the results correctly i may be wrong
we can look this up later what i recall is they were surprised to see
uh unexpectedly broad deactivation of certain parts of the brain now this also reveals a sort of a myth
about mris and brains and one of those myths is that you can take snapshots of a river and understand
what the river's doing right by just looking at these little snapshots yeah um which is kind of insane
and the other thing that i think is silly and typical i do i would do the same thing
obviously we would suppose that activation equals power right so you know those things that are
activated that's the stuff that matters right right when it turns out that as far as brains and nervous
systems go stuff that isn't active matters a lot too and actually you know i've heard you've probably
heard this dumb phrase that you know is old now and it's probably been mostly uh
dd referenced or whatever i don't know what the word i want is where like you know you're only using
10 of your brain right like yeah that's because if you were to use like 80 you'd explode you know like
i wouldn't be a good thing the 10 you're using is about the 10 you want active to not just be you know
dead or whatever there's this there's a bunch of weird tropes in in our human knowledge systems
that don't belong there that are often the result of mechanic the mechanization of the meaning of
features of activity relation circumstance character all these things right more is better power is
activation yeah you know like i'll just mention one of the other things so
obviously consciousness is very much an experience of a broad array of kinds of feedback first the other
thing i don't want to lose track of hopefully i won't see um inhibition of that produces unexpected
results inhibition of the filters that are usually in place right which is part of what happens what
this is what we're after with intoxication we're not necessarily after activation right or after is
could you just take could you just turn that filter down a little bit let me feel like oh wow i can
feel the way that thing is moving i feel like i'm moving inside the way that thing is moving right my
my emotions are doing the dance that the and when you and i look at like flowing water you know we
follow it we follow and then we look away and the the reality's working we're getting a feeling we're
getting a um a little bit of a taste of the what i would call the photic driving right which is the
iterative restructuring of our visual experience and neurons perhaps over time and then when we look
away it takes a while for them to adjust so this is things doing this right the walls doing this or
whatever after looking at the water moving um there's something i don't want to lose track of
the difference between sunlight and moonlight right because it seems to me that sunlight
the symbol in the sunlight or even the color or the shape in the sunlight is as if the sunlight declares
things to you right it is blatantly obvious where that is what it is its color and so forth whereas in
the moonlight thought the same thing now you have the inhibition of the explicit right and so that means
the suggestive that might be a dragon's face in the tree bark that looks like an animal over there
that's scary right and it's just a rock um is that a baby or you know like you can't tell what things
are and the color is in not there it's grayscale and so the pareidolia uh becomes vastly enhanced um
in the presence of darkness or moonlight which i think also is reminiscent of the difference between
the masculine capacity to declare directly to direct and the brilliant mystery of the indirection
of the feminine to suggest to lead by example to um inspire rather than to look like all of these things
right um the the men often right they they come face to face with each other women are more likely to sit
beside each other in general um there's all these little features of the differences between
what we might think of as being um somewhat idiosyncratically masculine and idiosyncratically feminine
but particularly with light and consciousness i just want to distinguish these two things sunlight is
intense it's declarative it tells you what stuff is moonlight doesn't do that it asks you how are
you going to relate with that you want to relate it could be this could be that what do you think
there's a there's a there's an invitational right whereas this is very much uh presentational
this is invitational right the the denotative versus the connotative the associative right the definition
versus the uh the connotation so you were talking about feedback and filters yes yeah please feel free
to continue in whatever direction feels right yeah i mean so like go to for example observed that
color only arises through the limitation of light so the idea of limitation i think is more generally
bound up with perception or qualia so i think that the idea of filtration is really
at the core of perception in ways which modern neuroscience generally overlooks because we
emphasize activation but i think activation really deadens perception uh if you if you accelerate some
process um within your brain i suspect that you perceive less not more so yeah you perceive more
by um inhibiting the propagation of the signal yeah i mean where it is so yeah whereas like endeavors like
neural link i think assume the opposite if we simply speed up like a computer some information processing then
it'll become a genius but i think you're actually gonna lose some you know some iq points there hmm
that's a more complex supposition because i know people who
i know different kind there are different kinds of people who can multi-process
in ways that are astonishingly profound i don't know if they're having intuitional super function or
emotional super function they're certainly having something like cognitive and or intellectual super
function and some of these are like high performing uniquely minded people who might uh acquire labels
related to autism or spectrum you know stuff but then there are also people who are for example yogi yogis
and gurus and things who can demonstrate ridiculous multi-processing of like doing six kind of math
problems at the same time while writing a poem and you know what dancing and do a bunch of multi-processing
things because the um in this case in the in the case of the yogi the yogi of the guru i suspect that
what's going on is the liberation of a bunch of energetic burdens that are ordinarily in place
so now they have new degrees of freedom that are uncommon for us you know ordinary folks right yeah
well the sensation of freedom i think is related to inhibition so the the inhibition of that signal
yeah so as you descend to the condition of a material object
the um the dislocation or the separation between cause and effect collapses so your perception
i think correspondingly diminishes so in other words if you if you speed up some process within your
nervous system you're more bound up to become more like a material object than to become a free conscious
agent yeah i mean this uh gives us some insight into the profound effulgences of experience relation
identity that occurred during dreaming because now suddenly the nervous system is in a very
erratically different state from what's going on while we're awake most of the time yeah and so you
have all this energy with which to i mean isn't it fascinating but given given the opportunity
the mind naturally creates universes which disappear upon awakening like that's pretty remarkable in my
view right um that this naturally goes on all the time and my tai chi teacher when i used to ask him
my old tai chi teacher casey mao i want to ask him about um his dreams because i was really curious what
does a tai chi you know what does a tai chi teacher dream about he said oh i don't dream and he seemed
to be disturbed by the question i was like what do you mean you have dreams like oh my dreaming stuff's
only for that's just for people whose chi isn't flowing properly like that's what happens when your
chi's all plugged up essentially right it's not flowing uh when you when you when your chi is flowing
naturally everything is always healing and being regenerated you'd say i don't necessarily believe
that or know that it's true i didn't trust it much at all when he first said it i thought this is a man
who doesn't understand dreaming probably understands tai chi with not dreaming but i don't know it's an
interesting possibility yeah um clearly the dreaming does regenerate it has does dreaming does a bunch of
things that aren't just the mind making up universes right it regenerates the organs it cleans the
blood all kinds of crazy stuff going on it restructures the foundations of memory perhaps it's a way of
actually repairing holophores right because it's it brings connotative symbol not not just symbolic but
meta symbolic identity relational meaning and so forth are reinvested in uh in the the the elements at
play in the dreamscape it seems to me yeah dreaming is clearly bound up with memory
i suspect that dreaming is related to what i mentioned in terms of filtration and feedback
their association or their separation we agree about this yeah i mean filtering can be thought of
as buffering it can also be thought of as inhibition right right yeah and let's be really clear if you
had no inhibition your chance to pick up that glass would be zero right right you just right you wouldn't
be able to move articulately movement requires both things successful articulation like crossing the space
and grasping and all these things involve both feedback and inhibition yeah right
we don't usually think of inhibition as power but the concept of power would be useless if there were
no no buffering no inhibition right you'd never be able to articulate the power in any way that was useful
however i want to hear more about the problem of utility as you brought it up earlier and how
something's been happening over the development of our species where in order to to um emphasize this
concept of utility we're we're being deprived of and mccrafts enslaved or broken in some way please say more
about this yeah um yeah i mean it might have something to do with trade mercantilism or money
like the evolution of money because money appears to have evolved from technical objects so yeah the
first forms of money were really just tools uh which were deliberately destroyed or tarnished
so for example like uh spearheads were used as forms of money in the ancient past
or broken fish hooks were used as forms of money
yeah so there appears to have been this process of ritually destroying certain like technical icons and
then using them as media of exchange uh so yeah money and technology are interwoven there
um but yeah the idea of denominating beings in terms of a single unit or metric is precisely
analogous to the issue of measurement that we discussed earlier it's the same kind of
mode of thinking it's you know the idea that we can subordinate the totality of our environment to a
single you know homogeneous unit which itself is devoid of value but because of its uh you know dearth of
qualities can be uh used to measure anything qualitative yeah that whole paradigm i think is
yeah it both underpins our concept of money and the technological infrastructure of our concept
of science so those in my view those two developments are are are together they belong together i'm reminded
of having heard a story perhaps in possibly in the dawn of everything where um
uh unlike our possibly your common suppositions about i mean look money is one of the worst ideas
that has ever been implemented on any planet anywhere around here i mean it's just devastating it's it's
the um it's the representation it's the collapsed representation of all forms of value
right so once you got that all those other things can't compete with it and they get ruined it just
breeds uh bad behavior basically yeah um it's the most it's one of the most perverse incentives you
could possibly have but um yeah well the idea of use at a deeper level i think is really
a matter of being controlled so it's the exact opposite of what we tend to think so you know
i think that i use a tool but really what happened is that i lost something and now i find myself being
used by some like infrastructure yeah that's i mean the automobile is a great example right you're being
used by the automobile you have to pay for the it has to occupy space the road occupies space all that space
is dead when the car isn't moving you it's not a car it's just there it's a thing you have to pay the
insurance you got to fill it with gas you have to make a spaceport you have to try to keep it safe and
protected and all these things right so the car and then the car uses your civilization to reproduce
itself at ever increasing costs over its evolutionary time that's costing the possible evolution and
preservation of vast arrays of organisms and beings not to mention the fact that it kills damn near
everything it touches without any sort of like relational integrity whatsoever just touch die
touch die all day long right i mean we used to drive back in the day when there were insects you know
before ddt you drive like 50 miles and there'd be squashed insects all over your car you know like
it's hundreds of them all the different kinds you could see them dead on the car now you drive your car
100 miles there's no insects two maybe none you know um it's weird it's terrifying like the thing just
kills by existing and so yeah we get used by our tools uh well similarly we think that we tend to think
that money is something that we need to require money somehow is substantial but really money is the
embodiment of debt money is the embodiment of something absent so the wealthiest people in our
civilization are those who actually dispense money who get rid of money so the wealthiest people in
our civilization are those who lend money they they don't want money they want to they want you to
have the money you're the one who's supposed to be in debt right so that's brilliant um yeah the irony
but uh what i was reading that i thought was very cool was that these i i can't remember exactly what
was going on but here's here's my presentation of it for its work there were these island cultures they
could get to each other but they it's a lot of trouble to get to each other and um so they
invented this game of trade where they would trade like shells or whatever let's say these little um
those little shells uh of the they're curved and they have a sort of comb-like structure on the bottom
i can't remember what they're called cowrie shells maybe they would gather up these cowrie shells
registered plentiful on the beaches it's not like you have to go hunt cowries or anything just gather
up the shells and then they would get together to trade them because it's really fun to hang out with
the neighboring island people you can make food and you know women use men exchange and children to play
together and stuff so they would they would do this trade thing not because they cared about the cowrie
shells but they need they wanted something the reason to like come together and and extend have this fun
right and have the culture exchange and that's a very charming vision of the possibilities of trade
that i think is um i i don't think that was invented i think i think they like talk to these people and
the people basically said like yeah we have this stuff that we trade but it's not because the stuff's
important we like like to get together you know have fun be human and share stories and learn things and
make stuff together and whatever so um it's not all bad this is this commodification thing but the money
is pretty much all bad it's just death you know it's it's blood and suffering and omnicide and ecocide um
represented right like condensed into this stuff that we
we track in banks and just terrifyingly stupid idea and no one would ever sign up for that if they
had if they felt they had any choice nobody would opt in these zero people it's just that you we acquire
the mores expectations behaviors and
uh impoverishments that are natural that are embedded in our time place and the people that
we are born in you know born with and come up with we we reiterate those fictions almost as if
almost like the opposite of the form of the salamander right that that arises again and again in time
echoing into the future this is the opposite of that this is a death from the future traveling like an
empty fossilized doom traveling backward into representational uh expression and an action
yeah yeah it's really trippy to think of it that way it's it's like the death inside time of the time
being i mean i do think of time as a being actually or transcendental to a being but not a thing and not
stuff myself it's a it's a body that is transcendent or something right for me right yeah the movement
within technology i think goes from the circle to the ray so settled life cities and technology all
cleave feedback loops and render them flat wow yeah basically we take natural cycles flatten them
and then call that economic value so yeah and i mentioned earlier how like you know in a city
you move but you stay stationary right right so basically your ship moves and you're frozen
right normally you would move and the would just sit there it's the inversion precisely like you were
saying yeah it's this temporal inversion of what would be a really a circle yeah what would be alive
actually yeah yeah it's an inversion of living yeah so the whole concept of waste is at the foundation
of what we call economic behavior but as soon as we move we call it waste we need to start working in a
frenzy to make up for the loss of the ship that we transported yeah whereas i mean the planet doesn't
need to do that right right yeah so yeah waste is really the yeah waste not value is the the
foundational concept of economics without without waste without cleaving these natural cycles there can
be nothing of economic value so so yeah i think you're i think you're quite right um seeing it as this
inversion makes a lot of sense it's death making death and death debt these are much closer than they seem
yeah right right um it's not an accident that resemblance the tokenization of value though is one of
the most terrifying things humans have ever done um it just leads to every kind of disaster and
colonizing rape and just ruination
so you know i'd like to think that throughout our conversation
without having intended to do so we've accidentally practiced the authentic disclosure
that we hinted at the possibility of in the beginning
what do you think aletheia ah aletheia yeah aletheia the unforgiving yeah the disclosure yes yes
disclosure all right the unclosing wow beautiful unconcealment yes
and the discovery i literally disc over why right this over why
i'm grateful hopefully these conversations will continue uh in a similar or related form in the near
future i appreciate you man
likewise love you love you too
peace for now
