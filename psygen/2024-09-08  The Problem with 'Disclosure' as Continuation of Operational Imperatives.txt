Go ahead. Start with disclosure would be self-undermining.
Well, yeah, I mean, the irony of disclosure is that disclosure would be self-undermining because what would eventually be disclosed
is that the very basis of our appeal to authority is fundamentally misguided.
So disclosure would be a liberating revelation in the sense that no one would need to hand down a piece of technology.
No one would need to hand down a piece of, you know, classified information.
Yeah, that would be the true essence of disclosure as a liberating development in humanity.
So, yeah, disclosure, I think, is actually something of a paradox or a contradiction.
Explain what would be handed down instead of a piece of technology or knowledge of non-human civilizations.
Point at it for me, please.
What do we need instead? Yeah, go ahead.
Yeah, so I think technology is basically a form of concealment.
Concealment. So technology always conceals something ontological.
So basically, our ontology is flawed.
We think of the distinction between nature and technology because of our civilization,
because of the eclipse of certain symbols in antiquity,
because we no longer think symbolically, we no longer think like original human beings.
So the recovery of our humanity, I think, as something disclosed,
would undermine the transmission of technology.
It would basically undermine the control system whereby we find ourselves anticipating technological developments.
But, yeah, when I look at the disclosure movement, I see the exact opposite tendency.
Describe it, yeah.
Yeah, I see this tendency to defer to some kind of authoritative transmission of information or objects, right?
So that control system, I think, is anathema to human liberation.
It's like, it's part and parcel of our civilization.
It's just another dimension of its own religiosity.
Like, yeah, so the idea that we might be given some kind of alien artifact
that could solve all of our problems, our energy problems, right?
Or the energy crisis, the coming energy crisis, climate change, or, you know, whatever rubric it happens to fall under.
Yeah, that's my, I think that's the origin of my skepticism.
Yeah, the idea of a technological fix.
Yeah.
What I think actually constitutes...
It's a slave collar.
Yeah.
Right?
It's a slave collar.
It's a complex slave collar.
It's very shiny.
Everyone wants to put it on.
Of course we want free energy, a scarcity-free society, the end of war, end of disease, all technologically accomplished.
Handed down to us by either the military-industrial complex and or aliens.
Yeah.
Right.
So maybe, you know, we couldn't, maybe we couldn't accept being lorded over by a bunch of, you know, military aristocrats.
But we can accept, you know, being lorded over by some extraterrestrial civilization.
Like, it's just a god.
It's just a god religion.
Uh-huh.
Right.
I see.
It's a slave religion.
Right, right.
So that's, that's the origin of my skepticism.
I suppose.
Because...
