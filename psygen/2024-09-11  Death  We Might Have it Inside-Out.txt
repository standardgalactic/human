all right well I guess I'll start with the what happened to me the other day
which was I was sitting for my normal hour this was in the morning and I went
to go sit and I got a massive rejection from my body not the usual type of like
uh you know I want to move around a bit but an actual like we're not doing this
this morning like you do not have the capacity to sit down for an hour and be
still there's something something going on and so I wasn't about to fight that
I think there's only so much rigorous you know technique can provide if your
body's fully rejecting you know the practice so I sat with that for a bit
kind of did some stretch stretches and allowed my body to move and I found
what was coming up was I was having a lot of questions about the technique that I
was using which is Vipassana meditation and what kind of questions um kind of
questioning the long-term effectiveness of the technique like am I going to
graduate from this am I just going to keep sitting doing this for my life like
how is this going to evolve and those questions were leaving me kind of
restless and I think when you doubt a technique and then you try to perform it
it definitely does not go well at least in my experience so I felt like I had to
reconcile sort of the questions that I was having like what am I interacting with
when I feel all this energy moving in my body what you know they talk about in
Vipassana like enlightenment like that's the final goal they basically say straight
up there's no they and when asking the teacher they don't even conceive that you
might like not have that goal which that was my experience and so I don't
necessarily strive to achieve enlightenment I don't even fully
understand what is being asked of someone if they are being you know told
to have that be the final goal and so those were questions I was having and as I
was kind of toiling around with them my eyes kept scanning over to this book on the
bookshelf called astral dynamics and after about the fourth time that my eye
caught it I was like okay I'm gonna pick it up and over the course of two days I've
read a little over a third of the book and almost every question that I've had
about my technique has been answered in some capacity and I'm excited to finish the
book and see where it goes but alongside meditation and alongside this book that
talks about the energy systems of the body and how to project that enemy energy
system in order to have a conscious out-of-body experience you know what are
the implications of this and this all has led me to questions about death like
most people in my life view death as a hard wall that they're scared of and you
know depending on the religion or lack of they have sort of ideas of what's
behind this hard wall of death but I in my experience with you know suicidal ideation
and really being interested in death just in general I've sort of developed this
relationship with thinking about it and as the years go on I don't fear it or at
least I'll say don't fear it as much there's certainly been times in my life
where I've thought that I conquered my fear of death and then realized that
there were deeper layers to of it that I was still clinging to it so I'm not
really trying to fool myself or anyone here by saying that I've conquered the
fear of death but as far as I can see at the moment it's not really something
that bothers me I test myself on that you know it's like I'm in this car like at
any moment I could die and I'm like yeah pretty surrendered to the idea of it
so there's something to it and so I you know maybe we can just start off with
that like why do we fear death I don't know how far we'll get in making progress
and actually knowing what the aftermath of death is you know is it even a wall
because everything's going to die so it's it's a very natural process it's not
like it's something to run from or prolong yourself at least not for you will
eventually succumb to it so yeah I'll leave it there
so much to explore here so as I recall shortly after you had these experiences
we had the Sunday extinctionati meeting right and this topic naturally arose
right but before I launch into some of the things we discussed there I want to
notice a couple of things perhaps you have the wrong idea about what you means
and I'm not just trying to be canny about language here you know like well what do we
mean by you're going to face it or whatever yeah of course that's one that's one possible
perspective mostly when people ask questions like that um they don't actually have something
to offer they're just trying to be kind of uh linguistically canny right depends on what
you mean by the you know um or was you know that's not what I'm trying to do here what I'm trying
to say is um see we have this problem that I think is very important to face which isn't merely death
when you get in bed at night you are going to come to an end you will end you come to an end
and it's not exactly the same as death because you've learned over time that you trust the fact
that you'll wake up in the morning it's not guaranteed that you'll wake up in the morning any more
than it's guaranteed that if you get in a car you'll be coming home later so even though we
believe you know we feel and probably act as if we can be assured that we will wake up frank truth
is we face the end of waking consciousness when we fall asleep it just goes away right and we have
this you know in the hindu tradition they have um the acronym a u m um which stands for things that
i don't exactly know but i know what the meanings are they are i think a is the waking mind u is
probably the dreaming mind i may have these two switched and m is deep dreamless sleep so deep
dreamless sleep is something that we all experience we have no recollection of it except that we may know
we have slept right but we don't remember having been deeply dreamlessly sleeping um so that's very
interesting and implies that actually we may be training for death while we're alive we may be
you know there's there's like the sort of um heartbeat thing that goes back and forth between waking
and waking has a broad continuum of states trance like states hyper awareness um overthinking hyper
vigilance uh zombie doubt you know i'm just um playing this video game for five hours reading
which is a form of trance um watching shows which is kind of weirdly reminiscent like what are we what
what are we watching shows for what exactly is that is that an attempt to have a dream while we're awake
except a dream of people we don't know about things that aren't really related to our own life
except perhaps tangentially or culturally or something so there's all these things going on
that are really very complex and we don't think about them very clearly a lot of the time
um that dreaming might be training for death is a very important idea
or that it might just be the reminiscence of previous deaths and never mind training if we've
been through this thousands or hundreds of thousands of times as is often claimed by yogis and gurus and
buddhists and so forth then we're not training at all we're we're we're experiencing echoes or resonances
um throughout the waking state and then throughout the sleeping state both right so in the waking
state we're having echoes of dreaming and death and even death seeking in intoxication or high risk
behavior um any encounter with sex is related to an encounter with death the idea that orgasm is a
little death is not a fancy linguistic trope um so there's there's a very complex array of situations
going on here that i think it's important to acknowledge do you have any thoughts about any of
that you know for some reason um you reminded me of my dream not last night but the night before
um there was a point in which i was swimming to a lighthouse and it took me a long time to get there
i mean i watched the lighthouse get closer and closer and throughout the swim it was like shallow and
deep shallow and deep it was not like a very consistent you know ocean floor and i got to
the lighthouse and i touched it and i was like cool time to head back to the shore and then i was back
on the shore and the people i was swimming with were you know like ready to move on to the next thing
and i'm like whoa whoa whoa wait a second i don't remember swimming back and they were like well you did
it took us about 40 minutes and you know now we're here and they were just like trying to get the dream
moving along and i was i was like i don't remember we just it was as if i was at the lighthouse and
i'm on the shore and and there was no and i was troubled by that i was like where is this missing chunk
of time um and i think it was triggered by what you said about the uh the dreamless sleep you know
i think when people are one of the things that people are afraid of is that it's like oh i cease to
exist beyond death you know it's just nothing like that you know that doesn't scare me but it would
raise a lot of questions or it does raise a lot of questions if that if that would that's what lies
beyond this you know illusory veil of death like what what could that possibly mean for
existence you know um so yeah questions leading to more questions again so many interesting things
here so my son uh who's been studying advaita vedanta for some time now and sits very regularly
um came to me a while ago and i had discussed with him uh this this feature of dreaming that i call a
granch which is a three-way branch and the three-way branch is that something occurs in the dream that
causes one to have either a question or a concern about identity or sequence either one of these works
really well and these you know these basically lead to one of three kinds of experiences each of which
can be wildly different though they belong to the same category each one belongs to its own category
first one is so you have a question how did i get here how do we get back to the shore right and what
you're having is a question about sequence um i don't i can't recall i know that before i was at the
lighthouse and now i'm at the shore but i have no memory of the between that's a problem why can't i
remember the between if we actually travel back how come i have no memory that's the kind of thing
that can end a dream and the dream has an interest in not ending so often what it will do is something
i call backfilling which is really important and that's where it presents some plausible explanation
dream version plausible not waking world possible right um for for how things got here like why am i
my favorite trope is i'm running through a medieval castle being chased by a three inch tall pink
tyrannosaur i'm terrified of it i'm screaming and running and then i suddenly wonder wait how did i
get in a in a castle being chased by a tyrannosaur and then the dream will just backfill any old poetic
things like yesterday was the birthday of that cloud for that hides the sun and the moonlight makes
little tyrannosaurs that become pink at 10 a.m and this one sniffed you out and as it followed you
you know and and you're just like oh yeah of course of course that's what yes yes and so the dream just
keeps going um it backfills though and then whether or not you accept the backfilling if you accept the
backfill then the dream generally just continues if the backfill fails or if the dream doesn't do it
well if the dreaming aspect fails to compose it well you just wake up but there's a third position where
the backfill is attempted it doesn't fail nor does it succeed and you become aware that you're dreaming
and that uh that leads into the broad continuum of possible states of lucidity which is extremely
diversely complex so i'm reminded by your dream that there was a granch there that was a backfilling
moment but what my son came up and said it was super mind-blowing never occurred to me before
was um
every night you go to sleep your identity comes to an end uh now when you're really small you
probably don't have much of an identity right there's nothing concrete you don't know like oh
i'm nathan with has the blah blah you know i'm brown eyes and i'm this old and my parents are this and i
live here and duty duty duty if someone comes up to you and asks where you live when you're very young
you probably just say here right it wouldn't be like an address so it's kind of like your mind's a
lot more like the dreaming like it's not um it resists static identity and it resists complex uh verbal
conceptual explanations it just doesn't need them it doesn't use them um and it and it it doesn't care a
lot about sequence either right what was yesterday uh doesn't matter what's tomorrow i don't know
right like it doesn't you don't know you have no idea what time is because you haven't been doing
this linear time sequence thing that the adults do so um you know my son came up and he was like
what if you're mate what if what if you don't actually what if you have no history at all
what if your waking mind is doing the same thing your dreaming mind does it's just backfilling in
an entirely different more logical more rational way right you don't really exist you're confused
you're not you this isn't here yesterday wasn't yesterday tomorrow isn't tomorrow your waking mind
is just backfilling in this way that it habitually learned to do as you got older to convince you that
you have a static identity that everything's static all this stuff is continuous the door is the same
place the door was yesterday the chair will be there tomorrow and so forth and that was very
mind-blowing to me because it doesn't it's one of those things that it doesn't really matter if it's
true or not it's really profound to just consider it that's that's something that's been coming up a lot
for me i mean during meditation um so often the past is brought up it bubbles up it's like oh you
didn't process this 11 years ago here it is bud and it's it's served on a silver platter because i
have the spaciousness and the ability to relive these painful events um and what i notice is as
i'm processing these on these repressed memories emotions um i notice how younger versions of myself
present themselves in the present and have a voice and sort of are like act like devils and angels on
my shoulder that um you know come to influence my decision making and so like yesterday i was running
into a lot of my insecurities surrounding um worthiness like intrinsic versus what are the sum of
my parts that make me worthy and if i don't have these things then geez like i gotta i gotta be smarter i
gotta be fitter you know otherwise they're just gonna throw me out with the trash and say anyone
anyone yeah society society big other the big other right like like someone's gonna peek around the
corner and be like got him you know um yeah that radar i got that radar gun yeah worthiness and you
drive by and fail and and so like this question of who's at the driver's seat you know a lot of these
repressed things when when allowed to have a voice they will really they're like finally you let me
speak like and they'll just talk and talk and talk and talk and i hear them out and then if that
meditation session isn't enough to really process it all i i find that it starts bubbling up during the
day and so when i'm finally able to release and um i've sort of had a peaceful resolution i can see
the objective truth of what had happened and i forgive and i let go it doesn't bubble up anymore
and so it seems to me like aware of the present moment here i am and i'm what i'm releasing all this
past stuff what will become of me when i've made peace with all of these repressed things and you
know how will my mind choose to backfill because right now it's it's all past stuff or it's it's
you know trying to think of the future and trying to plan so sorry for a pound thing to share um
your description reminds me of a moment in ifs therapy where a protector part quote unquote or
some other part comes forth and tells a story yep and we receive that story in a loving and supportive
and unconditionally positive regard um and then we ask that part questions i don't necessarily like
the the language and i'm not um totally committed to the yeah i'm not committed to the jargon but the
uh concept like what's going on there very powerful um
we do seem i what i would probably call the word this probably doesn't matter but the word i would
choose instead of parts facet right um like we are a complex crystal and that has these facets
and the facets become confused and think that they're separate
and they get stuck with really weird jobs over time that they think are absolutely imperative to
the survival of the self and so they it's sort of like a little kid trying to lift up an elephant
all day long and thinks like if i don't lift this elephant everything's going away
you have to just lift this elephant or hide the elephant or whatever it's doing and so
it's interesting that there are these facets and that the pressure
and charge and pain and shame and guilt and fear and loss
um that they are that they have internalized
uh are real until they're they sort of dissolve in the awareness and reception of loving compassionate
uh embrace yeah so that's that's something i honor i think it's very important to have these
experiences to help each other have to and support each other and having these experiences
experiences and it's interesting that in your um relatively recent
uh you know beginnings of meditation practice which started with a 10-day vipassana retreat which
as far as i'm concerned is like trying to swim to the sun and then getting there
like actually making it i mean i just can't
i can't praise that the courage with which you undertook that enough because it it's uh
you chose in a sense uh to face death while you're alive right this whole vipassana thing is very
similar to just dying dying to your everyday habits your everyday expectations even the things
were like am i worthy and blah blah blah the worthiness question is very complex because it has a lot to do
with two primarily we could examine them in a more complex way but primarily two gazes in the psyche
and the first gaze is the gaze of the critical self like so this is am i worthy to my own
standards and beliefs and things and then the second gaze is the gaze comprised of all possible others
otherwise known as the big o right the big other and so that thing you can travel around in that
lab or anything forever and just see from different critical possible gazes yeah i mean i see that you're
very enthusiastic about about that yeah so it's very important to understand that these gazes light
the mirrors of of our internality they light the psyche just like a spotlight lights a ballerina on
the stage or something and there's a there's a character to that illumination and we feel
the emotional valence of that character very intensely especially in isolation especially when
there's there's no one there to help us to encourage us to uh perhaps see more openly or gently and
sometimes it can be important to not see openly and gently sometimes it can be important to actually
experience the almost surgical scalpel of agonizing criticality that comes from the gaze yeah it really
depends situation to situation but that's a kind of death right that that agonizing criticality is a kind of
of a death and we fear it naturally it means um loss of relation right it means i so relation i so late
right i am late i am late coming i'm not with the group i'm lagging and the lag is caused
by charges built up i can no longer flow i'm lagging just like lagging a zoom call or a phone you know
you're hearing what they said but you're hearing it from three minutes ago or five minutes ago or
whatever right um so much more to say but yeah i mean that that lag that sort of description of um
you know facing death it's it's really interesting because most of my life i've just been steeped in
materialism no you know if i wasn't outright rejecting the idea of anything beyond just
physical objects um i was at least just agnostic and not really participating in any not really
i'd be like yeah i i see why you might think there's a god you know sort of thing and so within
that framework really my driving force was like i'm an animal and what do i want around me i want
women and power and money and like those things just made sense it's like of course you know i want
to reproduce if i'm gonna have a kid it's got to be my kid and it's got to be with the most beautiful
woman i could find and i might as well just get as many resources as possible and that part of me
still exists it still has a voice within myself and it says things like you know hey buddy by the
way you know you're and it doesn't really have as much weight weight in the conversation but it still
perks up its ears and if someone manages to find uh you know a soft spot in me that like makes that
can kind of knock me off balance that voice is like okay yep it's finally my time to shine like i'll take
over and so that with this really deep interest in like what am i what does it mean to be alive
what is death what is this situation trying to look outside of just that what i call like that the you
the animal perspective just sort of um you know accumulate resources and produce um you know trying
to figure out if there's a higher purpose for humanity and if so what that is and uh like
how badly do i have all this framed and and so um i think my curiosity and death is really
a key factor in trying to figure that question out because if it's just nothing at the end then we can
just throw our hands up as far as i'm concerned and and you know go chase the resources and the and the
animal pleasures but if there's this you know holy beautiful picture and um
you know that's i'm very happy to be a renunciate like i would do it in a second i think if i if i had
more scope when i was in that meditation retreat i was convinced that i was going to be saying goodbye
to a lot of my loved ones you know i was like oh wow like i mean you were being groomed a bit but
yeah i was being groomed a bit yeah i did kind of drink the kool-aid because you know they say
they're non-sectarian but man they make a convincing argument for chasing enlightenment um but i kind of
started to see through it uh because a big thing that i picked up there was like not accepting anything
that i had i can't experience for myself that was really important to me um yeah i was that did i
paint a clear picture or was that kind of yeah i think so okay but again there's some interesting
uh features that occurred to me while you were speaking sure
and first of all like you know when i say like my son is studying invite vedanta
he was listening to a particular teacher sarva kriyananda who's brilliant and i strongly recommend
anyone who wants to learn a little bit more about everything because sarva is a polymath and a
brilliant human being a generous human being someone who i trust who has like who i think has honor and
integrity and honesty and an incredible memory reads broadly talks with all kinds of brilliant people
he's a fairly young guy good sense of humor too and um you know my son wasn't my son needed an
intellectual path that was intellectually satisfying not merely um you know let's get past all this
mind stuff he needed something that he could sort of get his intellectual teeth in into and that's
and sarva kriyananda uh provided that for him which i think is amazing i've listened to maybe 10-15
hours of sarva kriyananda and he's brilliant i trust him there's there's not really a lot of recruitment
going on there um however
i only i want to touch on some of the things uh renunciation
you said if there's nothing at the end we could just go mad yeah grab all the stuff yeah right just go
like ravingly he don't heat on hedonistic um get all the commodities kill and rape and pillage
yeah and to be clear i wouldn't i that's that doesn't interest me i because i quite i mean i was
gonna make a joke about that but we're gonna we're not gonna play our normal happy you know
darren hassles nathan came and nathan hassles darren back or vice versa um for the moment we'll set that
aside but um you know i have a friend uh who is really brilliant and he said that um
he wasn't merely an atheist he was like something like a nihilist or or or some kind of existentialist
or he just didn't believe there's anything at all there's nothing and so he told me that he had to
develop his moral and ethical senses from first principles so this is someone let's be really
clear about this this is someone who thinks there's nothing and yet is motivated it's a very strange
thing to be motivated to do to develop a moral and ethical system anyway right so he doesn't just
he's not just a raging sociopathic hyper functioning right you know uh manzilla you know but i i think
that even if you don't believe in anything that doesn't mean that that is the thing that's primarily
the driver's seat of you know controlling your your feelings and thoughts yeah we agree but let's be
clear um humans often pose the situation as if there's only a reason there's no reason
for moral or ethical concern or behavior unless there's an accounting game at the end of the road
right and that's not true that there's nothing true about that that's very
i mean that buys into the accounting game at the end of the road gambit right so like the only reason
to have moral or ethical concerns is if there's an accounting game if you get something or something's
taken away from you at the end or even during the game and this um presupposes a very strange
situation that i don't trust at all i don't think it's anything like what's going on because i think
part of what's going on is not it's not a matter of what you get or what is taken away it's a matter of
the richness or or poverty that you experience of being relating knowing learning touching kissing
dreaming creating imagining playing it's that even if there's nothing even if there's nothing
and this is all empty right there's still this richness that we participate in the fertilization
and conception and embryogenesis and birth of during every moment of our lives with the world the sky
other beings the history of organisms history of minds all these things so even if there's nothing at
the end it just goes through a screeching halt of zippity pop right it would still uh behoove those of us
who are complex enough to feel and to understand feeling and look we're not making up this emotional stuff
this isn't an invention okay i want to be really clear about that this emotion is a kind of energy
energy in beings in motion between and among and above and before and after them so that's a dance
we're all participating in even if there's nothing after life which i think is impossible but uh but
let's let's be a little weirder about the afterlife thing and so if you'll bear with me for a moment and
i'm going to give you let me let's just i have nothing to say okay all right great i wanted to check and
make sure i wasn't just hogging the airwaves here as i want to do if not interrupted um
so i want to touch on some stuff that we talked about in the extinction audio meeting last sunday
just to recap it since it didn't get recorded but also to revisit it before i do that though
i'm going to say something that came to me now while we're talking now about this thing
and it has to do with a topic that came up in the meeting which is that i think we might have
life and death backwards in the sense that um actual liberty is to not be incarnate and complete
freedom and joyful wonder and play which we hear that's not the only story from the uh near-death
experiencers but it's a lot it's the most most very common and even the people who are like no i went to
hell it was terrifying i am not even going to talk about it would scare you so bad it'll ruin you and you
have nightmares for the rest of your life even a lot of those people um
many of them have an a sudden inversion of that experience like the experience starts out that way
and then something happens and it inverts into paradisical adoration and love um but here's what i'm
what i'm thinking um what if what if what we call life is actually the slow drip what if the vitality
of our life mind joy and excitement and enthusiasm and play and adoration hope and faith love and
creativity and all these things what if that's the slow drip of death into our incarnation what if
what if ever like we got it what if we really got it backwards right what if death is the the sunlight
right that is just shining inside our incarnation we're like no no don't bring the sun up no no please keep
the light away like i just i can't handle it because really um when i had an ex when i had the experience
that i refer to as toy maker in my science fiction language it was the sudden onset of a beauty so
lethal that were it to reveal more than the tiniest shred of itself i would be obliterated by ecstasy
right and and then i suddenly realized that what people meant what people might have what some people
might have meant by the fear of god wasn't like god is terrible and judgment and blah blah blah which
is how it seems especially in christianity and islam things like this no no it was this entirely the
opposite thing even though toy maker said directly when when we encountered each other i am not god
i don't think he meant like i am anti-god i am i am the not god i think he meant like don't be
confused i'm not the being that dwells in unity i'm just an emissary you know let's be friends and
i think that's what what's going on i can't be sure anyway my point is like wouldn't it be weird
if everything that's beautiful and exciting about life is actually the gentle imposition of the before
of incarnation and the after of incarnation and that sort of cat that that sort of scintillating
inward um you know gal like sky nebula galaxies stars above and before life and birth and all those
things and wouldn't that be amazing like if all of the the features of life that we most
adore and cleave to and and think like oh i don't want to lose this i don't want to lose it don't
lose it are actually the the hint of its complete disappearance into ex ecstatic communal beauty
right there's just the hints there there's like there's these little sparkles right like shooting
stars falling into each moment shooting stars of death light right and we're like no no don't let me
i gotta cling to this body thing i don't let me but it's because the distance from death gives us that
incredible um capacity for uh what we think of as enjoyment right it's just like the same thing
about like if you fast for a long time the food becomes really tasty if you live for a long time
the death becomes really amazing right so it's like really we're not trying to we don't want a long life
because we're afraid of death we want a long life because we want an amazing like rich death it's just
redolent with astonishingness and this is something that's never occurred to me before so this is this
is a beautiful moment uh for in my own you know considerations of these matters um feel free to
to opine in any way that you know i mean it's interesting because i'm combining that with the
you know widely held belief that there's multiple lives you know and there's this karmic
energy it's like uh you know even upon death people aren't ready to you know be completely
released into that and so they must go a lifetime through lifetime through a lifetime to give up
sort of the the material clinging and you know i think the language is sloppy there but
it kind of that that narrative is interesting to me i get that narrative totally makes sense to
me the karma and things except that karma is is a very complex thing it's not like we in the west
think it's not like you do bad stuff then bad things happen you get attachments and then you get
stuck and you got to be reborn to reprocess all that stuff it's not really i don't think it's much
like that in in the actual um i mean you can hear people like priyananda talk about this and that guy
knows you know everything a lot anyway about about the topic so yeah i think we're probably confused in
the west about what this karma thing is um but essentially it's something like cause and effect so
there's no you can't do something without another thing happening so if you if you set if you cease from
having causal imposition in your timelines then there's this sort of this sort of like
imagine a giant an octopus with billions of tentacles and it just sucks them all into itself
and it starts glowing and vibrating this is like poof and there's like a nebula there or something right
no more octopus that's the sort of thing that i think was meant by enlightenment right you just draw
back and and dissolve all of these karmic breads and that can be a linear process over time and this
is just my you know i'm not a genius about this i don't i don't know and i and i have you know karma
karma and i have an ego and all this stuff i'm not an enlightened person i'm a i'm a seeker but um
yeah this is mind-blowing so i'm imagining that the joy in life can be understood as the the gentle
sparkles of the waterfall of death flowing into each moment which is just such a mind-blowing
metaphor and analogy for me i love it um but i want to if it's okay i'm going to revisit some
of the topics we we spoke of during the extinction audience meeting so the first one was we might have
life and death backwards right we might really we should be fearing life because the you know it's the
it's only when you're incarnate that you face all these bizarre con you know conflicted
twisted tangled messes of conceivable pain and suffering and attachment and so forth and it may
not even be the incarnation itself but the relationship to it absolutely um and then i i
spoke of a variety of things like the idea that um a birth is basically the opposite of a kid with a
kite right it's like uh the soul which i think of as a web of beings and more like a solar system
model where there's like a central figure and there's all these constellations of um past and future
intimate uh relational beings around animals living places the sky our ancestors our progeny all these
beings right in a sort of uh in a sort of galaxy of relations what if the soul isn't a single thing
the way we think of it i think it's important to think this way like what if all past lives are yours
but they're uniquely yours so there's a structure of what we would call near neighbors that shows up
as nathan's soul and there's a different structure of near neighbors that shows up as darren's soul
and if we do a past life regression what you would find would not necessarily be your previous incarnation
your single possessed thing not like a linear timeline right it would be the the nearest of the
near neighbors of the constellation the constellating elements that that emerge as your soul uh structure
in your in your births right so that's one thing um but yeah the idea that that like the soul casts
sort of a fishing lure down into time space and that fishing lure it's it's the opposite of a kite or a
helium balloon right it's like it's gonna it's gonna instead of making something that floats up and is
light and flies it's gonna make something that's super heavy and just sinks all the way down into material
reality and then there's this two-way transmission between both features which you could imagine is
like your waking life is like let's get really into this you know structured i'm going to move the rock
you know i'm going to sculpt the diamond uh let's make the musical composition and then and then at night
it's like oh let's float and swirl and form nebula and galaxies and we're just going to do all this
amazing bloody blue stuff um and this is this back and forth right the soul instructs the material being
and then the material being uh transforms the potentials of the soul outside of time and incarnation
and something like this seems so much more likely much more like what's what what is almost certainly
happening like we can't know i think it's actually impossible to know what incarnation is or what the
beyond of incarnation is but if we're going to think about it and we're going to have fears and concerns
and stuff let's at least do it like a bunch like a group of science fiction authors right sitting down
the table going you know if i was making something like i'd get really creative right i'd be like
let's have some good stuff you know and i think the universe is is way more astonishingly intelligent
than anything the humans think so let's get outside the boxes of our fears outside the boxes of our
narratives including the stuff from the yogis and the gurus because that stuff is very compelling right
it's really sticky the karma and the you know past lives and all of that i think if we were and i
remember somebody went to um so what am i a long time ago when i was probably like 33 or something i went to
michael harner came to town he's uh he was an anthropologist in the 50s who went all over the place
to indigenous cultures and studied what they had in common with each other about their shamanic
practices and so forth right and he uh produced this uh condensation of what he learned that he
calls core shamanism which are practices shared by nearly all indigenous shaman shamanic cultures or
shamanic practitioners in various parts of the world that he visited obviously he didn't visit all of them
um so it's it's a sort of a a summation right and then a derivation of specific practices
and so i went to the seminar and he taught i managed to get his attention which was amazing
because there was like 300 people there and they were it was very wooish right there's a lot of like
you know people wearing feathers and stuff which i'm not casting shade on but i was i was i felt like i was
kind of wanting some more serious you know less uh less halloweeny um stuff and i managed to get his
attention thankfully early on when he asked for a volunteer so i got to work with him one-on-one
a couple times during this during the session he he paid attention to me thereafter as well
that's just i'm not trying to brag i'm just saying like i got some close attention from him i got to
interact with him directly and um he taught us essentially four things how to travel to the
lower worlds where you find your animal companions how to travel to the upper worlds where you find
your teaching guides how to read a stone in an oracular way for uh for someone who comes to you
right they have a question you have them go find a stone and bring you the stone and you read the stone
to them much like you might read a dream and how to dance the animals that you encounter in the
lower world and then also how to go for another person to the lower world and find one of their
animals and bring them back to them um so you can see that he's like there's an upper world there's a
lower world there's you know the reading of the stones there's a dancing of the animals there are these
things in the same way that the guru might say for example um you have past lives there's karma uh you're
going to be reincarnated blah blah blah but one day um not too long ago a close friend of mine when he
was almost he was about he was on his last legs right he was he was dying one of my friends came to hang
out with him she knew him somewhat well and um you know got him to sign my way of the shaman book over
there before he died anyway she went to him and she said that uh she was there one time when he was
talking with his partner his wife and she said something about you know the lower world where the
animals are and he turned to her and they had a sort of a conspiratorial moment moment he said
you know there really isn't any lower world right like that's just something we used
that's what people can think about so they know what because they're gonna try to understand what
to do and she was like yeah yeah of course we talked about this i remember this though but he was they
were when they were when they were having this conversation him and his wife they weren't really
talking to each other right they were talking to each other for the sake of the people who were there
right and he was like the slower world stuff it's not it's not really true and what he means by true
could be very complex and i don't know what he actually said i'm paraphrasing wildly but i suspect
that it's important to realize that teachers produce as if trope you know as if figures and models for us
because they know we want something to sort of cling on to a structure a ladder to climb or
you know something like this um a gulf to swim across to the lighthouse and then come back right
and then like i did swim back right i did i didn't come back over the gulf between here and the light
there is no gulf between here and the lighthouse nathan but um yes we did you know if you really
need to be reassured we'll tell you that we did the swimming it took about 40 minutes right there was
no gulf right but so you can see how beautiful the way the mind works to give us the structures that that
that the the thinking in the waking mind wants really desperately because it's kind of clingy
and like structure um so i wonder if really karma and uh past lives and stuff are a little bit like
that but i did talk to a man who claims to have both um it's a very strange point to make but i don't
doubt him he claims to have experienced enlightenment and also to sort of tapped others in such a way that
they experienced immediate enlightenment and what he said was that after his experience he had a lot
of trouble with specific deaths that he had undergone previously one had been a murder at a lake
that he described in in great detail and um these things acted sort of as uh weights right as like uh
gravity wells for his freed that that um inhibited his liberate his the full liberation of his uh being
right these these unprocessed agonic deaths that resulted in pain and resentment and um feelings of
victimization and or possibly the opposite where he had done something horrific or although i don't
recall if he actually said that i just know that it could go either way okay a few more things uh we
might have death backwards death might be the liberation i think the soul kind of casts this
weird like the the the picture of a kid with a kite is just the perfect opposite just invert that and you've
got this beautiful where the the kite is a like a nine billion pound weight right and there's a tiny
little thread barely thread that connects it to the soul and there's all these transmissions back and
forth across that that inform the weight and the soul and wherever the soul is right it's changing the
universe up there in the same way that the soul is changing the world down here as we're interacting
right now so like if what i'm saying is true then we're actually speaking from within that very process of this
back and forth like the soul is going yeah you know i'm dripping little droplets down there into
you and they're coming out of you and the insight blah blah blah so there's something kind of beautifully
we're accomplishing what we're speaking about in a weird way right now i think with if we're lucky
and uh and then um
yeah the idea that the soul isn't singular that all past and future lives are yours they're just uniquely yours
which um gets back gets us back to the idea of unity and communion right this is all one being
it's all one family one being one origin here always um i am divided for the sake of love
is a quote from alistair crowley a man who's you know questionably confusing but also brilliant
uh this is what was shown to me why would the being that dwells in unity shatter itself into trillions of
little stars well the reason it might is because all those different little stars in their seeming
isolation can have unique experience and then when they come back together they share all that experience
and they re-explode and get new unique experiences that are even deeper and richer and then they come
back together and so forth so really it's about reunion but you can't have a reunion if you don't have
the distinction first and with tyler and so on we talked at length about situations where like the dandelion
toy where everything uh is um like a strobe light that goes faster and faster it's expanding into
distinction and then collapsing the perfect unity the information is shared expanding back into
distinction collapsing the unity um and it looks like it's always distinct from our position but perhaps
from the position of death it's always one right or it's it's it's the shadow of the distinction
inside the one so that the unity is the primary felt sense and the distinction is sort of the dreaming
aspect right so many beautiful things here and then one of the members of the group um is m talked about
the death of a family member and how she was intimately aware she was with that family member before he died
she was intimately aware of his death process um there was some do you recall some of the story of around
this i wish i could remember what she said before about the before of the death but um
after the death okay she talked about um two things one was the deep felt sense of the presence of this
ancestor i think it was a paternal grandfather possibly maternal grandfather probably paternal
deep felt sense of the presence of this ancestor with her uh a poltergeist moment in a house where
a lampshade was shaken around with extreme violence in a room in which there's no wind
and then um visiting a psychic and just asking the psychic a single question like do you see anyone
around me and so you're just going like instantly yes your paternal grandfather he's there
um and then something about
uh either a close family member or a very close friend giving birth to a child
or two children that had all kinds of qualities and went to the same like went to the same school
or something that one of the grandparents went to his wife or something yeah as if um as if the soul
heading had disappeared from around her and reappeared in incarnate existence uh which
you know is is the kind of story we hear very regularly and then i mentioned this
rather bizarre but interesting film called into the void that sort of orbits some of these topics of
um in a rather dark way i think of uh death uh the between sort of the the limbo right death limbo
reincarnate you know sex reincarnation death limbo sex reincarnation how these things are linked
yeah you've uh basically taken the magic eraser of insight and scrubbed my brain clean
god just become a sponge myself well let's let's let's say some questions let's pop up some questions
jeez i mean once you get to playing around with like you're both unity and
and divided at the same time and you know it just becomes such like a cause and effect comes in the
question time uh free will it all it all dissolves okay let me just ask you something yeah you keep
saying this thing that you've been saying since we met and we met in a very unique way and i felt an
immediate affinity for you a lot of the time when people came to me with a similar um they came in
a similar way to me and want to contact whenever i felt very uh reticent but when i when you and i
first spoke i immediately felt like no red i was like ah one of my friends um monique talks about
navigating by uh a sense she calls the absence of no and that's exactly what was going on with us i was
like there's no no i don't feel any no so that meant yes right it's not like i felt like yes i just
there was i wasn't any no but just understand something really weird you talk regularly about
the synchronicity you did it about the book right the synchronicity that happens where you're starting
to have a question or a concern or you're feeling like pent up or frustrated or something's wrong and
then naturally the world starts you and the world right start relating in such a way that there are
these events that we could think of as quote synchronicity unquote that speak to you and guide
you and and and feel like like your desire is changing the possibility landscape that you're
traveling through as you're traveling through it and there starts to be this two-way communication
right and then you know you find that uncanny in a way i i mean it's very new to me and i'm as i
develop a relationship with it the more i realize it's constantly going on and sometimes i'm so
steeped in it that i don't even have a sense of self yeah yeah but this is an argument for exactly
what i'm saying you're just detect from one perspective that's merely your you're sort of
harmonizing with the unity right at from the position of distinction right so there's this i love doing
this feels wonderful right it's this yeah there's this snake-like movement of the fingers through
time right and uh so you can see that what i'm suggesting it's not an explanation for the experience
that you've described but it's a way of shedding some light on it and it's natural um and what i was
going to say was when you and i are goofing around and we just start like kind of giving each other
or playfully making up stuff like we did about when i was playing the british uh you know i came in
the room and you're sort of gazing at one of the bags and i i played the british uh broadcasting guy
when we're doing that there's something really weird that goes on it's very nourishing it's not
ordinary someone could say oh they're just being goofy or they're just playing but try to i mean
think about how incredibly entertaining people find all these little um tick tock videos and stuff
where people are really just goofing why is that so entertaining why is the goofing so entertaining
and it is very entertaining i think it's much more entertaining when we engage in it together maybe
that's why it's entertaining because when people see others engaging in that together right they
imagine themselves engaging in that with someone they're close to engaging in the goofing around
that you and i share but that goofing around is very kind of sacred it's very holy because in a way
we're giving we're both enacting our individuality while we're giving it up and coming together in this
third mind that is ecstatically ecstatic in the sense of not trapped untrapped untrap like we're
playing outside the boundaries of our persona and our personality and stuff and that might have
something like death and comedy could be a topic that really is important right death and play um
um these things occur to me as i'm starting to think about how it is that we come together in play
and comedic
experiment right in improvisatory comedic experiment but also with you and i like musical experiment
linguistic experiment you know poetry and music and stuff yeah it's strange you know i i've been wondering
like there there are times in my life where i've just felt so free and so like at liberty to just
have fun but i spend so much time thinking about how to solve the problems of the world
it leaves no room for any sort of like joy or uh playfulness to arise it's like yeah yeah yeah but
like think about the seriousness of this you know and i'm i'm wondering
i'm wondering about that because here we are talking about um
souls and and sort of this concept which maybe it's the concept of itself that's
i'm struggling with but just like of souls and togetherness and unity and you know trying to
figure out like why is there so much suffering why am i so sure that i need to solve these problems
you know if all of this is just one big play not a simulation you know not like the and of course you
get into like the simulation of what but what i mean is like if if we're doing this expansion unity
thing then all of this is one big play and not necessarily well so then yeah i mean this is kind
of where things become sticky for me because i i spend a lot of time thinking like oh my god like
i have to align myself with the highest of morals so i can navigate this terrain and like bring peace
you know and that to me it does not it's not playful it's not okay joyful so let me see if i can reflect
back to you something about what you're saying see if i've heard you sure so you're saying um
yeah yeah the play it's fun i love it when we do this uh but but i feel really compelled to pay
very close attention to the fact that the world is filled with injustice wrongdoing suffering apocalyptic
cascades of probable annihilation the ecologies are being slaughtered etc right the humans are being
tormented most of them live in abject poverty and agony and death and war and and so i feel like that's
so motivating that there's no like play should really be off the table until we rescue the planet
right and i also feel called i'm speaking from my understanding what you're saying to kind of a
messianic purpose which is like world saving like we gotta save these people we gotta rescue the world
we have to ensure that the future can keep being a future something like this the longer i'm left alone
typically the more i am feel like i'm preparing myself to be the best vessel of change that i can
be so that when i'm released back into the world i can solve the most problems and be the kindest and
most compassionate i can be and that sounds nice but internally you know it's like uh i'm putting myself
through the fire so that i can take other people out of the fire yeah and it's it i don't i don't feel
any of that joy or playfulness and so maybe you know it's not the way i'm going about things is too
serious um okay slow down so first of all whenever i invite you to play you show up immediately you're
ready to play every single time so far and similarly if you invite me to play you know i play um but
there's a bunch of things that might not be obvious to you things having to do with life path things
having to do with life phase like you are in the phase just post adolescence right and one of the
things that happens uh at the end of adolescence right about the end is we start and this is why i think
it would be helpful i'm just going to mention this novel protector by larry niven because very
relevant to this whole so relevant to this topic and brilliant i love it
pak is the hero's name he's a pack which is alien species but um
okay right around the end of adolescence we what starts to awaken in us is a feature
of our humanity our masculinity and our femininity like they're uniquely
embodied these two this feature is uniquely embodied in the masculine and feminine
context and of course each masculine person you know just it's not like bipolar is what i'm trying
to say every everyone has a complex array of these qualities masculine and feminine so to speak
but um what starts to arise is an urge to protect and at first you know you probably have already
developed the urge to protect your siblings your mother your father your home but what what starts
to happen at the end of adolescence is that starts to spread out naturally except for most of human
history the one thing was absolutely impossible was that it could spread so broadly as to the world
there was no such thing as the world rather the world was our world between that mountain and this
river and that forest our world and for each of the peoples the world was a living place it was
bounded by certain features this is our world it wasn't the planet i'm not even sure if they had an
idea there was a planet it's not clear to me so what i'm trying to say is you and i have come up in an
age where we are capable of thinking of the world and what happens is naturally the protection that the
protector feeling we would have had for our people our place
is expanded to a scope that's unimaginable yeah it is essentially expanded to the everything yeah the
everyone yeah every animal every plant right everything and that's a hard burden to carry but
what i want you to to just recognize what i would like for you to recognize or um what i'd like to
highlight is that this is a very conflicted process it happens it's part of your life phase development
i think in most of us i went through it and it it was crippling it was totally crippling i have panic
disorder i was like there's nuclear weapons i can't protect shoot i can't protect a shoelace there's
nothing can be protected because there's nuclear weapons and there's these people with a finger on a button
where they're just going to wipe out everything right so at the same time that that my um desire
to protect expanded to the world there was a threat that was unapproachable to the everything that you
couldn't do anything about effectively as a you know 20 something year old kid as i was not that you're a
kid so my point is to pay attention to these things and also realize that these are natural parts of our
developmental arc and i am the same way i also have still at 60 the urgent feeling that we must do
something to stop the humans we have to stop the humans like if we could just get them to stop doing
things right just stop doing things which i think the earth has sort of gotten in on this game and is
trying to get the humans to stop doing things in various ways yeah um one of the things i think
she has done is turn the volume down on go to work yeah you go you go to work right so people are just
like i'm not going to work fuck that i'm not going to work you know um so there's the it's not just you
and me this is an entirely natural part of our developmental arc and is also a natural part of our interiority we
feel the pain of the world we feel the urgency to protect this beautiful living place that is
my mother my daughter my my origin the most adored the most precious of all possible worlds is this one
right here i adore her without reserve uh in a way that's impossible for me to even describe even though
you know throughout many parts of the day i'm busy just going and i'm going to have hamburger now oh
i think i'll i'll make the bed here i will you know write the essay i'm going to make the recording
with nathan acting your call so and so you know i'm living my human life
but underneath all that i want this world to thrive in beauty forever you know people like well you know
the sun's going to die that's not what i'm talking about and they also say other stupid things like
ah you know you can't wipe out life on earth she's really resilient those people don't know what they're
talking about either there are ways to kill planet you know the same way there's ways to lies a cell
you know it was lewis thomas who once said that um earth's very delicate and he impressed this on me
deeply uh what it most resembles is is a single cell floating in time space and i would you know expand on
that and say something more like i think the solar system resembles a cell and the earth resembles an
organelle but that organelle has a membrane and that membrane is delicate if he lies that membrane
it dies
and even if it doesn't die all the way it can effectively die if you can make a
yeah i'm not going to say how to wreck it i know how i know how to turn the switch off
but yeah these are natural feelings i honor them
um give yourself a little bit of space and credit you're not alone these are these are feelings we
all experience i have them they are urgent in me even in people like amen hillman he has his own unique
embodiment of crush the prisons you know free the people let them know what it means to be human again
and stuff like that that's all that's all natural to those of us who are concerned with the suffering of
others um so those are beautiful things no need to feel trapped and compressed by them yeah
and you will find ways like even today you know you went on an ex you went on a on a journey to explore
one way in which you might um have an effect turned out this one probably isn't the one you're going to
chase but yeah you'll continue to do that and you you may find a context or multiple contexts that you
can interact with that do allow you to enact these concerns you may also invent one yeah i don't think
i currently possess the skill set to do such a thing i think i think you do well i think i think
that's really what i'm seeking is it's like i i just we discussed this before you went to vipassana
like if we could do this thing right remember we had some we had some models of what we could do
together yeah yeah i mean you don't have to do it by yourself you can find two or three other i don't
think anyone should do it by themselves well some people are going to kind of in a way your dad does
although he does it within a specific uh established cultural context that is yeah the organizations and
companies are built by other people it's it's impossible to do anything alone in my eyes
yeah i don't know i don't i don't get that impression you would die without other people
all the food that's in your fridge well it just depends on what you mean by alone but yeah i get
you well i just mean like you can forge a way by yourself like even if it's a very small way i have no
interest in doing that i much prefer to work with other people i just think there's so much more
power behind that uh-huh yeah i agree i'm just trying to say like
we can establish a seed around which others gather and form teams and go after you know goals yeah right
and that's all i'm trying to say okay here's let me let me be more clear um the off the ship the on
offer off the shelf solutions are not the only thing like there's a different you can go to the
library right or you can write a book but you can write a book right so that's all i'm trying to say
i'm not trying to convince you my perspective no i know i'm just i'm just you know i've done
quite a bit of thinking in this area and it's like that that off the shelf on the shelf thing is
a good point because there are people out there with way more resources than me and um
to trailblaze without seeing what's on the shelf and what's being done already and sort of join forces
with established roots that that to me seems like the wiser move before just being like you know
i want to sample the buffet before i start making some new food that's just not necessary
because i know the collaborative power of people and if i can contribute to a main vein that's already
bringing beauty into the world then it's just i think there's a cumulative effect i think i can do more
good in a positive setting that's been established than i could just trying to make my own and and
you know that's situational right like if there is a very niche problem that no one's done before
then that's one thing but i'm very curious about the philosophies and actions that are being done out
there that just are desperate for help you know i mean yes yes but but um people have weird one-off ideas
right like uber right i thought about that a million times nobody implemented it and then suddenly boom
there's you know your car is a taxi from now on and also there's the opposite i don't know if you
noticed but somebody drove by with a very loud machine a moment ago right right that person's a
one-man disruption zone right i'm gonna disrupt everything right now you know so one guy can be
very powerful uh if they can be that powerful disruptively they can be that powerful right in the
opposite direction that's a good point you know um so these are you know these are things i'm thinking
about yeah i mean i think that's that is a good point because it's a lot of what i'm trying to do
in my personal life is i'm just like how can i see the best and bring force to bring forth the best
part of myself that i can that impacts people because i've tasted it you know me too i've tasted what
it really is like to help someone and it comes from a place that's i'm not asking for anything and
yet you know i can only act from the lowest common denominator myself it seems because even if i i act
selflessly there are these parts of me that i notice that are just like hungry you know just just
malicious um i don't know if they're malicious they're voracious voracious yeah right and it is
they're well they're rooted in fear and you know and yeah i'm curious about these but i mean virtue is
is an attractive uh consort right so we're just gonna pretend that desirously we can you know go forth
and be brilliant and amazing without any any sense of okay it's not it's not like i do think i noticed
when i was young that there was a natural way to be kind and gentle and loving to other beings that
seemed when i say natural i meant comes naturally to me but i also noticed later that compared that
once i was introduced to the like you get you give you get right you take we take once i was introduced
to that thing still the other way was even better right it was like if i want something what i get
from selfless care for another is a feeling of beauty inside my heart yeah so should i feel guilty about
having that response to having been you know generous or kind or companioning with someone who's in a
crisis or whatever um yeah it could uh yes i mean that that's that's where i'm running into things
like filling my cup for others because i notice that often i'm like depleted and then i'm still
trying to be selfless and it's just fucking me up okay that's a huge problem because um now we're
talking now we're entering into the topic that i would call displacement which is i'm not taking care of
myself i'm not getting taken care of so i'm going to take care of others in the hopes that my needs
will somehow be magically met because i'm such an amazing force in the world and so if i take care of
them when they're in need i'll be taken care of when i'm in need or something but what that doesn't
address like if i have a four alarm fire inside my body or my spirit or something my psyche whatever
and it's not getting any care i can give them all yeah this is the shoes of the shoemaker problem
right like he's wearing these beat up you know scabby old he's fixing everybody's shoes they look
perfect you know every person who comes to him he's like oh yeah pay me later you know but he's not
getting taken care of or she so that that is a real problem um perhaps we are close to winding up here
yeah i'd say so but there's one more topic i'd like to briefly introduce which is one that we spoke
of last night we talked about you gave a story do you want to tell the story of the deer the deer yeah
yeah it's in autobiography of a yogi which has been a a book that i'm slowly filtering through and it's
i i have so many questions just because of that book um but he talks about uh
uh you know in his he has a group of followers and um they're young kids and they have this baby deer
that they're taking care of it's like a pet and he leaves to
go on a trip and says don't feed the baby deer wait until i come back and one of the
the kids feeds the baby deer and it becomes deathly ill because it was overfed and it's
basically on the verge of dying and he prays and pours his love into and just like god please save
this deer and slowly and surely recovers and then it comes to him in a dream that night and it's basically
like please like let me go like i it's my time to move on and go on to another life um and you're
keeping me here and so uh the deer falls ill again and this time you know they let it go they let it
fade away and that to me in you know i'm asking all these questions about death and here this story is
um the next day in this book that i'm reading and it's it's very interesting to me um you know uh
and that kind of sparked a conversation between you and i it's like yes you know perhaps
there's there's the impacts of that story but then there's also like if a being comes to you
and asks for help that is like you don't go you're gonna die all things are gonna die goodbye
you know like you help the being of course it's like i don't even have to think about it it's a
deep impulse that wants to help something in need that's asking for it and i think um
there's an interesting interplay between the two
so yesterday when you presented this to me i became somewhat militant yes i got very intense
and i'm i'm gonna resist that urge today but i i just want to highlight something very weird
there's a lot of really strange things about being human
well if you're not gonna be militant someone will yes he's saying again again one more time again
well so um there's a lot of really weird things about being human as was just uh synchronistically
demonstrated um but one of the most astonishing things about being human is that around here
you know we have all these myths about human supremacy and our distinction from nature and our
ability to control nature and being above nature and outside of nature and all these things and a lot
of that stuff is really dangerously lethal nonsense um because we're there's no way to be separate
from nature there's no way to be above above nature um there are ways to attack street signs
in the afternoon outside my house as if they were monsters and you were tilting at windmills but
um which is another very artificial thing that can happen um so my point was that it's very weird to be human
and i had a couple of points i wanted us to notice and the first was that the wisdom stories of gurus and
elders and so on can be very compelling and they can lead us into the belief that that we now know
how to be or what to do and and so one of the things that you just said was you know this doesn't
mean that that every time a being is on the verge of death or is suffering or is ill or is injured or
something we should just let it be because that's a natural thing to do we talked about this during
the extinction naughty meeting this is the idea of non-interference right meaning like if i want to be
liberated i need to be unattached to the the happenings in the world around me and literally
be in a state of non-action this is known as not attempting to change anything do not become attached
to changing things this is a common thing in monastic traditions non-attachment means not changing
changing now i've heard one interesting version i don't know if that's true i'll please continue but
i don't think that's i don't want to like form up against you too severely but i absolutely promise
you that it is um doctrinally a fact you will be trained in this doctrine that i mean that that i can
understand okay i don't think that attachment is this i don't think non-attachment means that you don't
make changes or you are not part of changing in many traditions this is part of the monastic path do
not attach to anything enough to intervene or attempt to change it now this is a this is a principle it's
not a law but we could become very confused by this one of the interesting inversions of this that i heard
was um uh aiken roshi my first teacher's uh lineage teacher uh john tarrant roshi's teacher um once said
if you love someone don't change that no matter what just don't don't don't change it right which is a
really interesting twist on the non-interference idea um so what i'm trying to get is we hear these
stories from gurus and elders and wisdom teachers and john you know joseph campbell and young and who
knows who right and a lot of those stories are beautiful and profound they can be very enlightening
but we should be careful to take them as um prescriptions for what we're supposed to do
in the sense that i'm not a guru i'm not enlightened i'm a human being swimming around in the sewage of
my own confusion it's probably not right i'm gonna get it wrong if i try to do the things that are you
know that are um prescribed by enlightened folk and so on it's gonna i'm gonna mess it up and um one of the
extinctionati members as a as an illustration of this told the story of the two monks walking through the
forest they're supposed to be not attached right this is the goal don't attach to things and also
it's strictly prohibited to have anything to do with women because that's a huge problem
anything to do with women just bind you up with karma of why you know i don't know why it's women
that bind you up with karma we should examine that in a later episode but uh anyway they're walking
through the forest there's a woman she's she's got to get across the stream she can't do it she's all
dressed nicely and she can't swim and the clothes she can't take off her clothing and be naked either
so one of the monks just picks her up and carries her across the stream and then they continue on
he sets her down the monk said you know you you violated the precepts the other one says what do
you mean i didn't do anything and the first monk says you you touched a woman you you carried her you
you you you you you were her breasts were resting against your cheeks and the first monk says well
i set her down back there why are you still carrying her um and so this is the thing what this implies
is that non-attachment isn't okay non-attachment isn't doctrinal it's not um it's not a law it's a very
strange thing it is that if you are established in the absence in the void in the negation of being
an attachment if you are established in the negation this is where you your non-isness dwells
then you can safely descend into all manner of human and situational situations and you will
neither be bound up in them nor will you create karma now what we're doing right here is talking
and that's a very dangerous thing to do and i acknowledge that and this has also been treated
carefully in the koans and the wisdom traditions right the difference between talking about things
and actual non-attachment but we can see even intellectually here that if you are established
in non-selfness you can descend safely into language concept relation uh worldly things and then just you
you won't be trapped in them yeah but if you are not established there you are very likely to be
trapped in them right and you can be attached to non-attachment exactly as the second monk right
apparently was right he's attached to the idea of non-attachment so the second monk has put on a
third hat right you're supposed to take all the hats off you know the second one is busy putting hats on
and thinking this is what it's but i know what's supposed to happen here and blah blah blah blah so um this
is a very important concept as relates to do we intervene in the suffering and or death of others or the
karma of others because there are many situations where we get you get in a big mess by intervening
in someone else's karma and i have recently come to understand this from my own very near uh term
behavior okay so now the last thing that i want to say and there will be more time for you to
opine or question things is that we humans are weird we are the one animal that has the capacity to
rescue other animals from the brink of death and each other and that's a weird power it's a godlike
angelic power around here there are other animals that can do very modest things you know the mother
could maybe pull their cub away from a beehive where it's getting you know stung to death and then maybe
lick it and pull out some of the stingers or something but if if any animal is injured in such a
way that it's not going to heal and it's just going to die only the humans can save them and that's a very
important thing we should notice in a very strange sense whether god dictated it or not it doesn't
matter we are in a sense the summation lens of the life forms around here we are the the one creature
that has the capacity to rescue beings from the brink of death to actively nurture them in very complex
and elaborate ways almost as if we were gods or angels and ironically that is the very power that
inverted at the level of our species is world ending we are the worst thing you can possibly
imagine i mean it's hard to imagine anything as devastatingly horrific as the human species
in a living ecology it just rips things to shreds for no reason and builds billions of little death
objects everywhere like it makes cancer look like play date you know so it's very strange that we have
both of these things and at the species level it's blatantly obvious that we are malignantly horrific
whereas the individual or small group level we can be profoundly beautiful or angelic if if morals and
ethics have any sort of basis so yeah i just wanted to notice like we are the one with the power to
intervene and that's a power that we should uh honor i think and and be aware of that we should should not
make us proud or hubristic but but we should humbly recognize that um we are endowed with the capacity
to uh intervene at the brink of death and if an animal you know we can intervene both ways right if an
animal is so horrifically ill or injured or it is in fact somehow its destiny to die now uh they can call to
us and we can bring them to a quick and hopefully relatively painless end but if they hope for
survival and and so and want to heal and go on living and maybe they have children or something
then we can also be the uh the pivot between those states yeah absolutely yeah i think uh as far as i can
tell compassion lies within us even through non-attachment it's it's yes it's really it truly just it it it
like forms in the absence of uh not clinging to things or being strongly adverse to them yes yes uh
here's what i've never seen and there's probably stories of this because we have stories of everything
i've never seen an enlightened being that just goes around slaughtering and torturing them and eating
their faces and you know crushing their children and burning their animals up yeah i've never seen
like an enlightened being going like yeah i'm just gonna be you know i mean i don't know if i've ever
seen an enlightened being and was able to recognize that i don't know you know myself uh
uh
so i have my zen teachers
i'm not going to comment at length about them but john tarrant roshi
i think he's cut through the mind yeah but um
um that tree in the garden that we walk around yeah
knows what's going on uh i i i mean i think if you mean an enlightened being but with what you mean
by an enlightened being is a human who's enlightened that's uncommon right but in nature i think there are
many beings who are enlightened and we just don't notice them because they don't they don't come up and
tap us on the shoulder and go hey nathan yeah would you like to shine i'd love i'd love that
if they did i'd love someone will tapped on the forehead and just shown the galaxy yeah
yeah sweet man um well it's it's a reasonable it's something that can happen quite unexpectedly i'm
open and ready to receive i thought i had to go like to south america and find you know castaneda's
teacher and whatever and then he was gonna i had no idea that that something from another universe
was gonna come tap me on the shoulder sitting here in this chair at this desk in 2002 but that seems
to be what happened i'm not claiming that enlightened me but it certainly changed everything i thought
about anything forever but yeah there are and also praying mantises you want to encounter enlightened
being just hang out with a mantis you're gonna find there's some crazy stuff going on there that
the humans have there's no narrative that can possibly encompass it yeah those little creatures are
they're like from five other universes at once and i'm pretty sure octopuses are similar and there are
other creatures who are also similar you know oh my god well i say it's a it's a good run let us honor
and remember all the beings who have struggled for the liberation and the rescue of each other their
children their progeny this world in the future the beings who dwell in beauty and wisdom and insight
who inspire us and draw us toward our capacities to embody
joy and wonder learning and amnesis mutual concern and rescue healing insight
joy and thank you darren thank you nathan that was yeah fascinatingly brilliant
