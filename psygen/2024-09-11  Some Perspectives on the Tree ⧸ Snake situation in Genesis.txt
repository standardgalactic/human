okay so what do you think of the relationship between the snake and the tree in Genesis
so all of this has been recently drawn into question for me by some of the work of
on Hillman I think originally well most of my opinions were related to specific
interpretations of the story in Genesis which I think I originally supposed to
have been cribbed from what would obviously be a vast story that was
probably orally transmitted by people I don't know who but the story never seemed
likely to me to have originated with Jews or the Hebrews it looked like it was
cribbed like there was a vast book that contained this this origin story or there
was never a book it had just been carefully orally transmitted as most
stories are possibly in song as most stories are and were including
probably the entire Torah before it was written it was orally transmitted we must
imagine that things like the Iliad and Odyssey were similar they were not
written down they were orally transmitted the whole idea of bards and poets
certainly involved but to get back to the actual thing itself what I usually
imagine and this is unfortunate because I'd like to have three perspective to
present instead of one so we could present the one that is you know sort of
common which is the snake is a bad thing representative of a rebellious feature
of this all becomes very ironic because if God created the snake right then if God
created this ridiculously hyperbolically comical being metaphysically comical that
we think of as Satan or the devil that's a really bizarre thing for God to do right like a
not only that I mean yeah it what it does seem interesting to have an opponent that that
does seem interesting but so let's just pretend for a moment that we have the regular ridiculous
interpretation the human self that the snakes a bad thing and it's coming to it's got some malevolent or
malignant intention that it wants to you know promulgate maybe it's jealous of the humans who knows why
because if it's powerful and has the capacity to give the humans something that raises them to the register of the divine beings and their way their ways of seeing
erroneous why would it why would it want to what motivation could it how does it possibly benefit and one of the answers could be
could be
by investing
an aspect of its own
intelligence,
its own form of intelligence
in the humans,
like a contagion, perhaps,
that is transmitted
generation to generation.
In the same way that it might
oppose God, which I think is a
hilarious idea.
You're going to fail at every...
How do you oppose God?
The only thing you can really do is oppose yourself.
So you're going to fail
at every possible
junction, which is a really
strange, fraught,
confusing
idea.
What being would want
to do that? Unless...
And we'll get there.
Unless something else is going on.
So, if it's the bad thing,
then it gives us this bad thing
called knowledge,
which leads to something like
conceptual knowledge,
which is dead inside, mostly.
It doesn't have to be,
but the way we use it, it is.
And so we become
cognitively dead inside
in the aftermath
of our processes
of enculturation and languaging.
But I'm going to
sing another story here
in just a second.
All right.
All right.
So...
In
May of 2002,
a process began
in my consciousness
that appeared
and felt
very
profoundly
like the intrusion
of another intelligence
and that
intelligence seemed
to be all-knowing
in a way that was
infinite.
not merely
like
knows all things,
but
is infinitely,
inexhaustibly
knowledgeable
about all matters,
including
everything about
the history of humans,
our minds,
our religions,
all this stuff.
And so I asked
a lot of questions
about this.
And in fact,
the one question
that I was very curious
about,
particularly
when it asked me
what I wanted,
was
I want to understand
what this story
in Genesis is about.
And it found
that confusing.
It seemed
to be confused
by that,
since it appeared
that everything
was on the table.
Like,
when it asked me
what I wanted,
it was like,
you can have
anything you want.
I was like,
can I understand
the story?
And it asked me
why I want that.
And I said,
because that seems
to be where
the problem
gets started
for us.
That's presuming
that that story
is important
or,
you know,
actually relevant
to our development
as beings
and so forth,
which is a presumption
I made
because it just
seemed puzzling
to me
all throughout
my life.
There's this
catastrophic accident,
apparently.
No one does
anything to fix it.
We are told
that it was good
before
and it was terrible
after
and it would be
terrible
basically forever.
And there's no
resolution?
It's just,
you know,
sorry,
everything used
to be good.
You're screwed
forever now.
Here's the moment
where it happened.
Good luck.
It just seemed
really weird
to me.
So I thought
perhaps if we could
understand the story
more clearly
we might produce
something like
an antidote
or a medicine.
And I was told
various stories
about this.
Some of them
are quite beautiful.
I have records
of a few of them
but I can only
remember one or two.
And one of them
is that
in the origin place
there are
these two
aspects
which are,
you know,
you can see them
as separate or not.
I call one
the being
that dwells
in unity.
This is not
merely the sum
of all beings.
It's the sum
of all possibilities
of beings
as a transcendental
one entity.
It's not clear
that it's the only one
there ever was
or will be
or that there are
no others
of its register.
But around here
it might as well
be true
that that is so.
So that being
relates with
which is a
relatively masculine
being with feminine
qualities too
relates with a
with a feminine
being that has
some masculine
qualities perhaps.
Perhaps.
I'm not sure
about these things.
They seem
to me to be
profoundly masculine
and feminine.
So there's the being
that dwells in unity
and it relates
with this
transcendental
entity
that I call
the living waters
which is feminine.
And by
touching and being
reflected by the
living waters
the being that
dwells in unity
comes to know
itself.
And similarly
by being touched
and reflected
in the being
that dwells in unity
the living waters
comes to know
herself.
And so these
are sort of
a primordial couple
in the place
outside of time
that I call
the origin place
like a child
might because I
don't know
what else to call
it.
And so these
two beings mate
and they produce
a progeny
that is extremely
precocious
and resembles
its father
is sort of
masculine.
Perhaps it's
masculine
because
it is
distinct.
It's a very
peculiar quality
to be distinct.
It's not clear
that the being
that dwells in unity
can be distinct
nor that the
living waters
can be distinct
only that we
can think of
them this way.
So they produce
this prodigy
and it's
in the origin
place
and there's
nothing for it
to mate with.
It can't mate
with its father
and it can't mate
with its mother
and it just
doesn't have
anything
kind of to do
and it's
extremely precocious
and has the
desire to
make
and go
and do
just like
any separate
entity might.
So what that
being does
is it punches
a hole
in the origin
world
and
thus
is born
in a sense
from
this leak
in the
trans-dimensional
trans-temporal
trans-material
place
is born
the possibility
of time-space.
Perhaps
this resembles
the Big Bang.
This is the
moment.
This is the
transforming thing
that caused
poop.
Infinite
density
becomes
whatever it
becomes.
Though I
think the Big Bang
is a ridiculous
fairy tale that
doesn't make any
sense.
It's kind of
a problem where
it's like
give me one
miracle and
I'll explain
all the other
things.
Scientifically
anyway.
Though I
understand the
arguments for
it and I'm
not entirely
immune to
them.
So that
thing by
punching a
hole in
the origin
place sort
of created
like a
reflection of
the living
waters that
we call
time-space
or the
universe
and
instantaneously
traversed in
a sort of
tree pattern
within that
living kind
of mirror of
the origin
place's
character and
activity.
It created
like a
instantaneously
branching
situation inside
time-space
along which
would naturally
develop galaxies
and star-birth
nurseries and
stars and
planets and
moons and
ice, whatever,
all the things
that would
develop including
organisms.
Everywhere you
see a star or
a galaxy or
something like
this, what
you're really
seeing is the
reflection of
the first
moments of
its transition
throughout all
of time-space.
If you think
about it
carefully, if you
want to have a
material universe,
you need
something that
departs from
unity, trippy
idea, something
that naturally
departs from
unity.
If you think
of the idea
of the
adversary, not
as a mean
thing or a
lawyerly thing,
but just
something that
departs from
unity, now
you have the
possibility of
beings appearing
as distinct.
You have all
these amazing
possibilities that
you really can't
have if there's
just one thing
or two
things.
So, in a
sense, one
could imagine
that this first
angel, I'll
call it an
angel, was
in fact, in
a way not
dissimilar to
what the
Gnostics think,
the creator,
quote unquote,
of this universe
or the
demiurge or
something like
this.
So, that
being has the
capacity to
divide things
and its
primary
power as
a sort
of one
of the
imagine the
reverse of
an umbilical.
What's the
reverse of,
what's the
inversion of
an umbilicus?
Because that's
sort of what
this thing is.
It is a
cutter.
It cuts
things,
divides them.
And by
dividing them,
it makes
possible all
kinds of
diversity that
is otherwise
impossible.
So, it is
highly creative
and you could
say that it's
fertilizing
identity and
possibility
through this
action of
transcendental
differentiation.
So,
there are
stories in
which it is
imagined that
Yahweh is
not God,
but is one of
the Elohim,
and is not a
good Elohim,
but a bad
Elohim that
wants blood
and gore and
slaughter and
agony and
judgment.
kind of like
a tantruming
baby.
I'm a
jealous,
fierce,
destroying
God.
And that
the serpent
is trying to
protect the
humans from
that,
wants to
inoculate
them.
And perhaps,
well, we'll
get back to
that story in a
minute.
Let's go to
the first one.
So, in
my little
fairy tale,
a child's
tale of
what happens
at the
tree,
okay,
this is
important.
So,
everything has
a place where
it was divided
from the
unity.
On our
body,
this would
be our
umbilicus.
Once we
were intrinsically
connected to
the unity
inside our
mothers.
for paper,
it's the
edge of
the page.
For
animals,
there's
probably
something like
an umbilicus
for most
animals,
but they
have sort
of a,
many of
them have
a kind
of a
metaphysical
version that
we call
a tail,
which is
really a
trippy thing
when you
think about
it.
It's
almost like
a separate
organism
attached to
the animal.
This
strongly
resembles
and is
reminiscent
of the
sperm's
driving
motor,
which is
a
organelle
containing
mitochondrial
DNA.
It's
basically a
strand of
mitochondrial
DNA,
if I
recall
correctly.
It's the
memory of
the mothers
that is
driving this
swimmer
in a
mass
exodus
into
the
possibility.
We think
like,
the
sperm
are
competing
together,
like a
horse race,
which one
wins?
That is
not what's
happening.
What's
happening is
the entire
cohort of
sperm are
promoting
possible,
the best
of their,
not just
the best,
the most
appropriate for
the given
situation,
moment,
context,
place,
person,
lineage.
They're
promoting
each other
in a way
that involves
drafting and
hitchhiking and
all of these
things.
They're
essentially
promoting the
contenders for
fertilization.
Then those
contenders arrive
in the near
proximity of the
egg.
The egg
electromagnetically
modulates the
environment to
be selective of
the few sperm
that get there
first.
So the
egg can
actually
apparently,
from what
I've come
to understand,
have a
selective
influence on
which sperm
get there and
which sperm,
what we might
call lock the
door.
Because once
one of them
embeds,
the egg
locks the
door.
Sometimes two
of them embed
at the same
time.
You get twins.
There's other
situations under
which you can
get twins.
The really
interesting thing
is that for
a time after
the locking
of the door,
the tail is
attached to
the outside of
the egg and
is alive and
the payload is
entering the
egg.
So you can
imagine that
all of us
might remember
a lost
companion because
we left
someone.
We left
the one that
we traveled
with.
We left
that one at
the gate and
it was alive and
we were the
same thing.
We were
together and
then we were
apart and
then it was
alive and
then we were
becoming a
being while it
was at the
edge of the
egg, sort
of signaling
to us, I
remember you,
we are
together, don't
forget me,
all of these
very heroic and
romantic ideas
that remind me
of, for example,
the film Hidalgo
and the
relationship between
the rider and
the horse in
this film.
Very brilliant
heroic film.
So, back to
the story.
you have these
two different
kinds of
beings, you
have an
angelic
being, which
I will just
call the
first angel,
and then
you have,
oh, wow,
by the way,
you can think
of this angel
as red if
you imagine
that red
means to
depart, right,
to depart
from unity
into distinction
is red, and
to return to
unity from
distinction
could be
blue.
In this
particular
model, there's
other ways to
think about it.
So, you have
an angel that
is a non-corporeal
being, and
then you have
what I might
think of as
the proto-forms
of the humans.
We can think
of them as
humans, but
I think they're
sort of like
the spiritual
potential that
will become
embodied as
humans later,
is how I
usually think
about it.
But, basically,
what you have
are the
transcendent,
non-corporeal
child, and
then you
have the
sentient,
soon-to-be
or already
material child,
which must
be a very
bizarre prodigy
to an angel.
How could
there be
beings made
of stuff,
right?
That's such
a weird idea.
There are
no stuff
things for
the angel.
And the
angel is the
father of
stuff, in a
way, in
this story,
but still,
the idea that
there could be
beings made
of stuff would
be really
trippy.
So, these
two children
are there in
the garden.
Oh, yeah, okay,
I have to get
back to the
dividing thing.
All right, so,
a long time
ago, I was
in an art
studio that
had kilns and
produced art
marbles.
These are large
and small glass
marbles filled
with colored
molten stuff, and
they're really
trippy and
amazing, and
most of them
are very close
to perfect
spheres for an
object made
by hand.
And so, the
process is you
take a rod and
you put it in
the kiln, and
there's a
crucible in
there, and you
get a glob of
glass on the
end, the glass
is clear, and
then you roll
that glob in
some busted
up little shards
of various
materials that
melt on the
surface of the
glob, and then
you dip it in
the kiln again
and get more
glass on it, so
now you have
like one, two,
three layers of
glass, and
then you take
that and you
roll it inside,
you turn it
like a rod, you
turn the rod
inside a half
spherical piece
of wooden cup,
right, with a
dip, a divot
sort of out of
the outer side
of it, so
you're turning
it in there, and
then suddenly when
you get a pretty
good shaped ball,
and you're happy
with the
sphericity of
the ball after
turning it in
there, you have
to pull the
rod out of the
glass, when you
do that it makes
a tail, now
you have a
problem, because
now you've got
to hide that
tail, right, in
order to make
it look like
the sphere is
miraculously
perfect, right,
can't have a
tail, so you
have to hide
that tail, and
that's really one
of the most
difficult things
to do, I
tried it a
couple times,
it's very
difficult to
hide the
tail, and
so what I'd
like to
suggest is
that the
earth, quote
unquote, which
could have
been the
protoform of
the earth,
had recently
been divided
from the
unity, and
so had this
sort of
umbilical
remnant, and
the angel that
did the
dividing is at
this remnant, and
is the snake, the
one who
divides, obviously
one of the
ones who
divides things
from life,
right, if it's
venomous, or
not, if you're
an animal, or
an insect, or
whatever, it
eats you,
divides you from
life, but if
it's venomous, and
it bites you, you
become divided
from life, but
it has, this
this is the
dividing angel, it's
the angel that
makes cuts and
distinguishes things
and departs from
unity, this is
entirely holy, there's
nothing evil about
that, without that
you can't have
universes, or
beings, or
anything, but
it's very curious
about the humans, and
the humans are very
curious about the
angel, and when
God says, of all
the trees in the
garden you may
eat, but do not
eat of the tree in
the midst of the
garden, this word
is not midst, I
mean, it may be
that we, you
know, this is
what is written, or
whatever, but the
word midst is based
on an unused
Hebrew root,
Tavek, Tav, Vav,
Kav, and this
does not mean
middle, it means
to put apart, it
means to part,
right, so what
it's actually, and
no, I've never
heard a, I don't
know a single
person that knows
about this, I've
talked to rabbis,
they're like, how
did you learn this,
we have no idea
about this, how
did you even know
this root existed,
this is something
that the angel
taught me, so, and
when it told me
these stories, showed
me these stories, I
should say, so it
means essentially
where the garden is
parted, right, which
is a very strange
thing, and also
Yahweh does, or
God, does not say
do not eat of the
tree of life, it
doesn't say that,
he says do not eat
of the tree in the
midst of the garden,
this tree of
knowledge, or you
will in that day
die, and so, Eve
somehow finds
herself at this
tree, the serpent
is there, they
have this conversation
in which the
serpent says you
will not really
die, you know, it's
good for seeing, you
will become like
us, you become
makers, right, well
you can't, if you
can't part things, you
can't make things,
right, I mean,
literally, you have
to part the lips
of a vagina with
your penis to
make a baby, right,
parting and
making, fundamentally,
you know, intimately
linked together, so,
Eve and the serpent
have a little
conversation, one of
the joys of my home
things, the rolling
garage doors, the
beautiful sound, the
musical, joyful sound
they make when
they're rolled up,
they come together, the
snake tells her, it is
good for seeing, think
about representational
cognition, it is good
for seeing, right, it, I
it, I mean, it gives
you a variety of ways
of seeing that are
interesting and
powerful, particularly
weirdly compelling when
divided from
participatory experience
and cognition
consciousness, but it
gives her something
which, which is
posed as a fruit, kind
of fruit of a tree, a
fruit, okay, think
carefully about that
because that is the
reproductive organ of
the tree, so, in a
sense, one could
imagine that the
serpent causes the
tree to have a kind
of intercourse with
Eve, to infertilize
her with knowledge, and
this knowledge is
certainly related
somehow to death, even
though it doesn't kill
you outright, so, you
know, one of the
stories is the two
different kinds of
children of the being
that dwells in unity
come together at the
tree, and one of them
gives the other one
its toys, right, which
is natural for
children, I got this
great toy, want to
play, it helps, it's
fun to play, you're
going to love this,
right, and who, and
perhaps the, the,
perhaps Eve also
had a toy to
share, which could
conceivably have been
her reproductive
organ, right, that
somehow reproductive
organs and toys are
kind of similar in some
unusual sense that we
are not commonly
inclined to
understand, so, then
somehow Eve
introduces Adam to
the knowledge, and I
think it's very
important to understand
that, at least
throughout the Bible,
and there are
probably other books
that have this
property, knowledge
and intercourse are
strongly linked, they're
not exactly the same
thing, they don't have
to be the same thing,
and the word doesn't
always mean the same
thing, but it often
implies the kind of
knowledge that you
would have if you were
kissing someone
intimately or having
intercourse with them,
which is an entirely
different kind of
knowledge than
representation, right,
it's an intimate,
visceral, trans-
somatic experience of
participatory union,
reunion, communion,
this kind of thing.
So, this all happens,
it's hilarious that
Adam and Eve then
become very concerned
about their genitalia,
that's a very strange
result, hard to
understand, God comes
back, they are hiding,
and Adam's like,
where are you, and
Adam's like, we are
hiding, and God's
like, why are you
hiding, and Adam's
like, because we are
bad, I don't know,
like, what do you
mean you are bad, how
could you know that
there's badness, right,
there's no, you were
innocent, something has
gone funky here, and
also, obviously, God is
omnipotent, two problems
let's see, the first
one is, oh, tell the
children not to do
something, you think
they're then gonna not
go not do that, how
many times have you told
children not to do
something, and found
that they just didn't
never went and did it,
so there's that
problem, but then
there's also the
problem of, obviously,
God knows, God can
see from outside of
time, so he knows
exactly what's going
to occur, but it
doesn't seem, but the
story is told as if
time is linear, and
God doesn't know
these things, which is
a very strange thing
to me, so then, now
I don't know if it
actually says this, I
don't think it does,
perhaps it's merely
traditional to think
this, or it's the
result of a painter's
intelligence, and
forgive me for
lecturing here, but this
is a long answer to a
complex question, they
covered their genitalia
with something,
apparently, possibly a
fig leaf, at least this
idea comes down to
us, and I just can't
remember if in the
Bible it's a fig leaf
or not, whether in the
Torah they say this or
not, or it could be
that an artist's
representation later
selects the fig leaf,
and this is why we have
this myth, but there's a
very, very interesting
feature of the
selection of a fig leaf,
staggeringly profound,
that I think also very,
very few people would
think of in relation to
this story, which is
the fig leaf's flower
is invisible, it's
microscopic, you can't
see it, so they're
hiding, at least if this
is the trope, wherever it
may come from, whether
it's from an artist or
the Bible or whatever
it's from, it's a very
interesting choice because
you're hiding your
genitalia with the leaf
of a tree whose flower
cannot be seen, that's
very trippy, so then God
comes and hands out
curses, and the way
that I was shown, what I
was shown about this is
that this is not in any
way God cursing the
humans, what's going on
here is that God in
infinite wisdom realizes
that the humans are
going to feel shame, and
they're going to feel
guilt because they did
the bad thing that they
were told not to do, and
so really what God's
doing is nothing at all,
he's just telling the
humans that there will
be consequences so
that they can feel
relieved of their
wrongdoing because an
accounting game has
ensued where, you know,
they will have things
that function not
dissimilarly from
punishments, but God
isn't imposing these
punishments at all, and
these aren't even, these
aren't curses or anything
like that, these are just
the natural repercussions
of what has taken place
that would happen
whether God imposed
curses or not, right?
The humans are now
going to sort of fall
from transcendental
naivete and innocence
into knowledge, naming
and distinction,
representational cognition,
all these things,
beings, and they're going to
become material beings,
right?
They're going to become
material, fully material
beings, and they will
thus undergo the
amnesia, right?
The sort of cascade of
amnesias that happen
between
before conception,
during conception,
through the embryology,
through the birth,
post-birth, through the
phases of development,
languaging,
enculturation.
It's basically a series
of cascades of amnesia
that get imposed on us
and then we have to
contend with somehow.
But weirdly and
astonishingly, one of the
curses God hands out
is that the snake will
now have to go on
its belly, which
causes me to, and
always has caused me,
to wonder, what the
hell was it doing
before that?
Because if the snake
wasn't going on its
belly, on the earth,
and getting, you know,
having problems with
dust and things,
what the hell was it
doing?
And the only thing I can
possibly think of is
that it was flying,
right?
Or maybe it was even
not material, and
so maybe they both
became material.
they both became
materially incarnate,
and so what we have
is this kind of
primordial pairing of
the hominids and the
snake, right?
Which you can imagine
for ancient peoples,
and if we evolved from
primates, which I'm not
entirely certain of,
even though I know all
the stories from science
about this, it just
seems ridiculous that
human, like some monkey
species, kept mutating
and produced us, which
seemed, I mean, we are a
weird anomaly on this
planet, to put it mildly.
I have no reason to
believe that we are the
natural product of
nothing other than
accidental evolution over
time.
I find that a very
strange idea.
Conceivable, I'm willing
to entertain it, but I
just, I find it weird.
So there's this primordial
pairing of the snake and
the primates, and you've
got to understand, like,
that snake thing is super
powerful in the psyche of
any animal like us.
It kills our children.
I mean, there's times
where we're, like,
swinging, primates are
swinging through the tree,
and, you know, Jane and
Jim monkey guys are
swinging, you know, branch
to branch, and then Jane
grabs a branch, and it's
not a branch.
Oh, shit, it's a snake, and
it eats her right in front
of her husband.
It looks like a branch of
the tree, but it isn't,
right?
It's a monster, or it's,
you know, it's not your
friend, almost never your
friend.
So this is a very strange
property of the snake, the
mip to the camouflage,
right?
It's death hiding in
something that looks
familiar, and that you're
intimate with because you
grab it.
You grab a stick, right?
If you grab it, is the
stick a snake?
Is the snake a stick?
You can't tell, and the
stick is the primordial
tool.
So this relationship
between snake and stick
is fundamentally profound.
Also, the snake divides
the universe by going.
Imagine a snake, you know,
slithering through the
sand, right?
And you can see that the
world is divided, but it's
also a wave.
It's divided by a wave,
which, and this wave
thing, it's like a living
wave creature.
It's crazy, the thing.
And also, I don't know how
much time you spent hanging
out with snakes, but if
you spent much at all, and
I've spent a little bit with
wild snakes, those animals
are not ordinary beings.
There's no chance.
They're just not ordinary
beings.
They are transcendental
beings, partially embodied
here in this form.
They are the part and parcel
of everything magical,
everything medicinal.
It all comes from this thing.
And it's not just, like, you
have stories that are way
older than anything from
Genesis or the Bible.
I mean, presuming that
Genesis wasn't cribbed from
a much older story, like,
say, a story 8,000 to 10,000
years old, we can't, there's
no way to imagine the
incredible potency of the
snake in the origin of human
cognition, thought, religion,
medicine, magic, everything,
everything.
But everybody who's holding a
rod or a staff or something
like that, they're holding a
snake.
It's just a frozen snake.
You see in this film, The
Ten Commandments, where
Moses comes to meet the
Pharaoh, right?
The Pharaoh brings out his
sorcerers, and they drop
their rods on the floor, and
the rods become snakes, and
then Moses drops his living
rod, his rod that has living
stuff growing out of it, and
it becomes a snake that eats
all of theirs, right?
And so, therefore, the
Pharaoh knows, like, oh,
shit, yeah, something's going
on here.
We're in trouble.
Our power is not, you know,
has no primacy in this
matter.
Additionally, but in much
older stories, like the
Blackfoot origin story, where
the sun and the moon are
going to come to the, they're
going to come, okay, first
of all, there's a problem on
the world.
There's a problem in the
world.
It wasn't called Earth.
It was the living, the
place, the Hogan, the Hogan
place, the sun's Hogan.
And the problem is, there's
snakes everywhere.
There's swarming with snakes.
So the sun gets really hot and
burns them all up, but they
hide in the cracks in the
earth, which, I mean, there's
so many metaphors here that
I'm not going to even start
to elucidate.
And then once that's done, the
sun and the moon come down to
the earth and they, this is
their, this is their, their
home.
They're like their pot or their
teepee, right?
And then they mate and they
have seven children.
And I'm not going to tell the
whole story, but essentially
what happens is the sun takes
the seven male children go
hunting with the sun every
day.
He's a hunter.
And, um, uh, when the sun
comes home, the sun has a
very, a very articulate sense
of smell, very sensitive sense
of smell.
And the sun determines that
the earth has been messing
around with something.
The moon, I mean, the moon has
been messing around with
something.
And so, uh, they surreptitiously
follow the moon and they find
out that she has taken a lover
and the lover is described in
I think a very important way
as a many legged snake that
lives in a hollow log.
This is a mystery that must be
resolved and I've been chasing
it for many years.
Um, so you can see that
there's this long before
anything like the Bible or
Genesis or anything got this
problem with chicks messing with
snakes way back.
This story is at least 5,000
years old and possibly 15 or
20.
Like it's a really old story.
Um, so yeah, this, this just
goes back forever.
Um, to, to finish up this part
of the thing, what happens up in
the origin place after the birth
of the first angel who leaves
is the birth of the second angels
and they are like Russian dolls.
They contain the, they all
uniquely each one of the second
angels, let's say there's five
of them, each one of them
contain the first angel and
they have very specific
elaborate abilities that differ
from mere division.
The primordial power is to divide,
but then there are secondary powers
that are very profound.
Um, one of them could simply be to
re, to reunite, right?
But another could be to
distinguish, another could be to,
uh, to pathfind, uh, within
intelligence, right?
Not just time space, right?
Not just like a, not just like a
scout, but a scout is a very
profound power.
Um, cause the scout leaves the
unity to see for the unity out
beyond where the unity is.
So they have these different
powers and then there are the
third angels and the fourth
angels and so forth.
They contain the, the previous
generations within them in this
toy of the situation.
And what are the angels?
They are the, um, inactions
above time, space, but also
within it of the unique potencies
of the divine being and also the
divine pair and also the divine
pair within the origin world.
So they are a bit like, it's a bad
analogy, but they're a bit like
living tools.
They have each a very specific
array of capacities at which they
excel.
Further questions?
Well, okay.
So what relationship then do you see
between conceptualization and death?
Wow.
Great.
We'll have to continue that one.
