hey amber hello great to have some time to chat together today how are you how how's your world
um my world is uh progressing nicely i will say that it's nice to talk with you again as well
we had some very astonishing previous conversations that inspired a broad array
of creative and insight activity on my end including a couple of my youtube recordings and also
yesterday i published an essay that i think was born the the ideas for it were born during
our first conversation which was so amazing to me um yeah my essay uh which is practically book length
called the umbilical disaster that i that i published yesterday i look forward to reading
that i just started it i i wondered when i saw that title because i resonated yeah broken connections
turn out to be an important aspect of how we came to know each other um that resonates on another
level but that's yeah another time feel free to yeah feel free to share anything about that uh
uh if you carry you later later okay sure so um we met uh we'd been friends on a social network for a
while and and we met when i saw some posts from you that implied that you had uh suffered a very
severe injury perhaps you'd like to say something about what happened to you um yeah so i was um
um driving home from work and so i'm 38 um healthy fit person um independent and life is going on as
expected you know uh nothing out of the ordinary well no there was some signs but um anyways i go to work
and on my way home i was on 95 i-95 in jacksonville which is a highway um and the traffic around me just
came to a dead halt and i remember thinking i had enough time to think uh oh i really hope the person
behind me is paying attention um and that was the last thing i remember and i woke up a few hours
later coming out of the icu i was being woken up from spinal surgery um so apparently the person behind
me was drunk they were not paying attention and they rammed their truck into the back of my car and i
fractured a few ribs i had a small brain bleed and i severed my spinal cord um not completely it was a
burst fracture so the bones burst and went into the spinal cord um and it left me paralyzed from the
chest down um and a lot of people don't know this but being paralyzed isn't just about not being able
to walk your spinal cord sends signals to all kinds of systems in your body so when it comes to those
systems uh the signals being interrupted it's your immune system it's your bowel it's your bladder it's
um it's everything i mean that's how we communicate with the world around us and the world around us
communicates to us so it's not just losing the ability to walk
and that's where we are so i'm in the process of i'm very much still in the process of um adapting to
that new identity i have not fully embodied that identity yet that was in november
wow yeah thank you so much for sharing about that um of course this is what led i think when i
when i became aware of what had happened in your life i reached out to you
uh we had not had any direct communication prior to that and um part of why i was interested
in speaking with you
is that i suffered
injury uh at first in 2006
that kept me essentially bedridden for about two years and then again in 2009 which kept me trapped
in my house for almost 10 years wow i still i haven't asked you about that actually yeah yeah so
it's a cryptic injury the doctors have no idea what the problem is um they don't really believe
my uh descriptions of what i experience it seems to be a muscle tissue injury um related to where the two
muscles the sort of bilateral musculature of my body is joined in my deep abdomen
um it's a very strange and painful situation uh when it you know when it's torn when it was torn
it was just like unlike most injuries which tend to get better over time this thing would just get
that massively worse if i even injured it modestly so anything like shock um that you might feel for
example if you stamped your foot a little bit or if you stubbed your toe or your your foot would um
just cause a cascade of ongoing injury for months on end and i went through a lot of
devastating experiences with that although you know i did fairly well with it um all things considered
uh for the the nine years that i was that i was you know stuck in my house until around what um
um maybe 20 late 2016 early 2017 is when i was able to get uh back outside again i first at first had to
sit my way down my stairs and i can relate to that yeah it was it was crazy so did you have to use any
sort of mobility aids uh no i didn't i was able to walk but i couldn't do really incredibly simple
things like um it's very strange anything that would require torque from my hands would cause tearing
so like i couldn't open i couldn't lift things that weighed more than about a pound and there
were some ridiculously simple things i couldn't do uh that were quite surprising like it was literally
difficult for me to cut lettuce with a steak knife or you know in in some spans of time during the
injury it was hard for me to lift a glass of water that was more than half full not hard in that i
couldn't do it hard in that if i tried it it would injure me um so like really small amounts of physical
force became extremely difficult to exert safely and it's probably difficult also to imagine the
psychological impact of a situation like that um you know i was able to to walk around uh relatively
safely in my house i couldn't get down my stairs and it was way too dangerous for me to consider
going outside not to mention that i couldn't bring anything home from outside if i did go out
so yeah that was uh an absolute nightmare um and i'm glad to have survived it but it gives me some
degree of what i would call um like it's different from your injury but it gives me some experience
about what it's like to be suddenly deprived the quote unquote or let's call it changed right to be
suddenly physically changed in terms of deprived sounds pretty good too i'm trying to be i'm trying
to be politic right i'm like well you know maybe it's not exactly for me but yeah it is uh
uh it's a really difficult transition
for anyone who suffers something like this um but it i was speaking speaking just for myself
okay so let me just try to be really clear from my perspective then i'd like to hear some things from
you about how you're what you feel and think and see um from my perspective
i learned so much and i became hypersensitive other faculties developed in me that had never been
developed um because i couldn't go out i learned to reach out to people um with my voice and electronically
um i formed some very profoundly intimate relationships i don't necessarily mean romantically
but uh just really deep amazing relationships with people far away over time um a variety of other
faculties became uh extremely like emerged in profound efflorescence inside me
in the beginning of the injury i had visionary uh very strong visionary um experiences i'll talk some
about that later what i mean by a vision um and without the use of drugs uh all kinds of astonishing
transformations occurred i wouldn't i don't want anyone to be hurt or to think that um you know we have
oh here's something i really would not like to encourage people to think uh while it is true
that radical transformations in our situation may result in the discovery or emergence of non-ordinary
experiences faculties or abilities i think most of those faculties and abilities are available to us
outside of um extremely uh stark transitions in our well-being or physical state or something like this
in other words we don't have to have a catastrophe to have um experience of some of these features of our
our natural humanity but so so what i'm trying to say is just that uh there was a lot of downside huge
amount of downside and pain and suffering and isolation loneliness um medical concerns that couldn't be
resolved and all kinds of things but at the same time there were there was a little bit of a of a bright
of a bright side to the to my situation please share whatever your thoughts and feelings are about similar
um perspectives okay so
hmm uh as far as non-ordinary states um
um that is something i had actually had experience with prior to the injury um
um and the irony is i almost feel the opposite in some ways where
uh i feel like i'm not able to focus on those realms as much with my current situation however that being
said there was a transition period right after the injury that is just now starting to recede
where because my identity was changing so rapidly everything i was familiar with
was removed um me not being able to grasp onto the next thing the next moment anything familiar um
um it did start to open certain states um
how do i explain this uh
i think the closest i've ever been to
i think the closest i've ever been to experiencing any sort of the edges i don't not fully but just
the edges of a unity consciousness or perceiving the energy of that um
which is different from some of the other non-ordinary states that i've played with prior um
um
but as i get into a routine my
that part of my mind is you know it's finding things to grab onto again so that's not as easily
accessible what i am getting an education in though in a much more grounded way is um
i am becoming hypersensitive to the creation state of the mind prior to something manifesting in physical
reality because i have to um so what i'm experiencing okay uh let me preface this a little
so i have done um a vipassana retreat before and
after days of being in this retreat i was getting frustrated because i couldn't feel what
the everyone else was feeling you know they're saying focus on you know the wind touching your arm
and i i i couldn't feel it i just couldn't understand and so i had a meeting with one of the teachers and
she said well explain to me what you are feeling and i told her i said you know i'm feeling these pulses
like blood moving and um electrical signals and she said oh you're inside she said not many students go
inside quickly so i and i've had other experiences that have led me to realize that my
natural state of being is much more internalized um so i have a natural map of my internal body which is
very very very convenient for my current situation so um i don't have as strong of an external awareness
so what i'm experiencing is um my internal map
my internal map got cut off um because of the spinal cord situation so i'm having to rebuild my internal
map but i'm not but what so it's amazing is as soon as i rebuild the map i've literally i took a video of
this i literally saw the electrical signals traveling down my body um so what i'm experiencing is and i can
feel my i the i this the best way i can explain it is i can feel my energy body beginning to create the
next step so it gets created in my electrical system prior to the muscular system or whatever physical
step you know the more meaty step down if you want to say i don't want to say step down but i don't know
how else to say it um there's no value judgment in up and down go ahead yeah so
what i'm so what i'm experiencing is that it's so counterintuitive if you want to try to move your
leg you do it with your muscles my muscles are disconnected if i want to try to get something
to respond i have to visualize it happening and send energy to it in my mental map and it only works
that way it and it doesn't work fully i have to rebuild the connection so um
it's i guess that's that's the biggest lesson i'm getting so it's much more
um it's very very physical and it's very very grounded and very very close to home not far from
home i would say prior to this my connection to um more uh i've had telepathic experiences um
kind of frequently to be honest um and i experimented with that i played with that i tried to understand
that but right now i'm very very focused on my own you know my own being because my being is not going
to rewire unless i focus on my being and so i'm feeling that so as another example um my mental map
i've managed to build in my legs but my glutes were not part of the mental map they were just not there
and i couldn't get them to activate and i was with my therapist last week and i finally got
them included into the mental map and as soon as i did she felt the electricity moving through so
that's that's been i mean that's my entire i'm a pretty obsessively focused on that and rebuilding
that map and so it feels like i'm rebuilding my body but i'm doing it in the ethers
that's brilliant i'm so glad you said that and it's almost as if we are talking about
two uh what's the right word i want here
two corollaries of the possibilities of human experience that are that are related but incredibly
like they're almost like the difference between being awake and being asleep so i'm saying like
something like i got hurt i i started having non-ordinary experiences
and if i may reflect back to you what you were just saying in or what i took from what you're saying
it was something like i've had kind of the opposite uh experience of what you described aaron i had
non-ordinary experience including telepathy and such prior to my injury but after my injury everything is
about becoming like getting my physical being to rewire yes and to have the the potential to work toward
whatever i can do to reestablish faculty like abilities physical um senses musculature organ signaling
all these kinds of things i have to come back into my physical body in an absolutely fundamental way yes
and i am responsible for every inch of uh and have like i will only inhabit what i engage with
right right so in a way it's a bit like for you our our two situations my historical one
and your present one are very different in that in a sense for you it's it i don't really put words
in your mouth correct me change what i say say whatever feels right to you but um what i'm getting
is it's almost like you were evicted from from the lower part of your body no a hundred percent yes
that's exactly what it feels like yes i got you i basically was to be honest yeah there's there's
still um the autonomic nervous system is still functioning and doing its thing but the part of me
that has any willpower is not not home say anything you want people who haven't suffered like this to
know about what's going on for you wow wow it's i can't even begin to dance around that without
uh wanting to come to tears um okay the the first thing
that was immediately apparent to me that i wish if i could go back to prior to injury i god i just wish
like just appreciate just appreciate just appreciate just appreciate simplicity things are not as hard
as you think they are just oh the simple things just just being able to have the simple things it's
it's everything everything everything you need to do is available to you at all times
and it's really that simple and that beautiful the other thing that became very apparent to me through
my stages of grieving is i'm only experiencing what we will all experience eventually i just
experienced it very young but everybody now given if someone else they might experience it all at once
right before they die but everybody is going to go through a slow fading away of capability and freedom
yes that has helped me a little bit with the grieving process because i recognize it's only a matter of time
um but it's very it's a strange lesson to carry being young and being around other young people who pity me
and i'm looking at them going oh you don't understand though you pity me but it's coming for you too you
just don't we all will get this lesson eventually brilliant okay say more about the first thing uh
appreciate the simplicity i think i know where you're going there and i could paraphrase but i'd like
to hear it in your words i don't i'm not i guess okay
i would get up in the morning and i would hate getting ready for work and all there's just so
many simple things that were an annoyance which is such an irony to me now like i i was one of those
people where like i hated basically all bodily functions like oh gosh i have to go to pee that's
such a pain in the butt like do you understand what i have to go through to go pee now it's like
oh if only i knew but i we we make life so much more complicated and we try to all the striving
that trying to be successful the complicating everything um with the dramas and the stories in
our minds and none of it none of it matters uh and it's i i wish i had a more tangible example but
uh the the vision the the image that just keeps coming to mind is how much i would love to just
sit outside and have my feet in the grass and have a cup of tea and not have to deal with
the physicality and the issues that i'm dealing with
and there's really nothing more important than that it's really there's just nothing more important
than the simple things i don't i don't have a more tangible example
okay i'm gonna try to reflect back to you in my own words something of what i've understood from
what you've shared here would that be all right yeah great so there's so much that we take for granted
the capacity to lift a spoonful of food to our mouth and chew it uh the capacity to you know walk
down some stairs or carry groceries home to feel the soles of our feet i guess right to complete a breath
without mechanical assistance yes um to see to taste to hear to speak um to feel sensations on the surface
of our skin all of these fundamental things of our being we we are in a way okay this is actually a
really rich topic and direction that we can explore together and we're going to get to some amazing
stuff here so i'm just i'm still really excited to be having this conversation with you and so grateful
um all right here we go we're strap in because this is going to get astonishing uh quickly i think
we're busy bemoaning things that don't matter we are living in
in such a privileged state most of us many of us much of the time of the absolute luxury
of physical wholeness freedom health and we're worried about things that have no bearing on our
existence whatsoever it's as if we've been spoiled by the incredible freedom and luxury
those of us who enjoy you know physical uh well-being and health and so forth and we're worried we're
thinking things like oh god i got what i gotta cook dinner yes you know yes oh i have to go to the
bathroom yes i'm emulating almond hillman here but um oh oh geez like uh i don't want to drive down to
the grocery store and get stuff um or even uh with people who are who are sort of much more okay now
this does um what i'm going to say next sort of in enters into the terrain of specific forms or aspects
of neurodivergence but there are people who bemoan the fact they have to go to sleep right like i don't
want to sleep that's a sleeping thing i'd rather just keep doing things i want to be fun i want
to be i want to get stuff done i need to get stuff done right i've heard musk i think mumble things like
this uh in some of his off moments like what's the sleep stuff why why do we even have to do that or
eating food you know why do we have to eat food that's just ridiculous couldn't we just can we just
mechanically take care of that so we can keep getting stuff done which is you know a very left
hemispheric quote unquote um maybe not left hemispheric let's call it uh
certain features of the waking mind um and the grasping aspect of the waking mind which is a bit
disembodied right yes yeah disembodied just doesn't care about the body like why do we even have to
mess with this stuff i just want to get i just want to be effective 24 7 right tick tock tick tock
i need to get everything done which is ridiculous because that leads to a life unlived obviously you
can get all the things done you want it doesn't produce meaning or value but what i'm getting at
is we we have this problem that the humans have in general which is that we're suffering from a
catastrophic exit excess of luxuries and so we don't realize um it's very difficult for us to
orient onto what is actually meaningful profound and important about being alive in a human body
and to have to start in the position of incredible gratitude yes right like i can speak walk see hear
eat um you know eliminate waste i can breathe i can feel things on my skin
and so the other thing that can happen uh your my anyone's mileage may vary if we undergo some kind
of catastrophic deprivation or um you know something like what you and or i have suffered is that we
can become vastly more grateful for the things that still remain to us as well it definitely awoke in me
a kind of humility and respect for the fact that i can still there's so much i can still do i still
have even with the incredible curtailment of my physical liberty and power and i have to just
basically at least briefly mentioned you know for a man to be deprived of his muscular power his capacity
to just exert force is very emasculating like most guys i know can push a car um i can't push a heavy
grocery bag you know and i and the other thing is like i look completely physically fine so when people
look at me i remember a time when i had just gotten out and i and i was you know walking around and i
had i was in a restaurant and i asked one of the i asked the doorman actually could he please assist me
with the door and he looked at me he looked at me like what kind of a privileged white are you anyway
you you don't you don't want to open the door for yourself he didn't say anything but he looked at me
with this look like are you kidding me and i i said you know i know i look like an ordinary person
but i'm injured in such a way that i can't open the door for myself and he looked angrily and kind of
you know i look i don't know what he was actually thinking i have no idea he didn't say anything
he did open the door for me but it's just this feeling of shame you know as a man this incredible
feeling of like guilt and shame and um emasculation and uh but on the again on the other side like all
of the sensitivities and you know these days when i wake up in the morning i take a moment
more than a moment i take some time to uh run an inventory of the stuff that i'm actually grateful
for that i still can do and be and say and and just that i'm alive these kinds of things yeah it's um
i think what people don't realize is we are not all of us but many of us we are living in in eden
yes and it's right there yes but we're spoiled in a way right we're spoiled here's the reason we're
spoiled if one day a week we could be blind one day a week you know every other week we could be
deaf one day a week every other week we could have our physical mobility to you know suspended
right then we might start to remember i've seen occasionally here in san francisco it's been a long
time since i've seen it now but i've seen blind people walking sighted people around with blindfolds
oh wow that's right that's amazing
you know so if we could be it would be really powerful for us because this is the problem and
i'm not i don't want people to feel like i'm making an accusation or an indictment that's not
what i'm trying to do here no one no one needs that that's not helpful i'm just trying to say that
the incredible freedom and privilege that many of us enjoy while we are healthy and whole even with the
occasional illnesses and injuries or misfortunes that we may experience which are you know can be very
challenging um or painful or frightening or you know really mess us up they can but even then we
still tend to respond as if we feel entitled like like my ability to walk down the street and carry
things and move the car with my muscles is a given right my ability to see and you know poop and all
these things that's just a given that's that's you're given that free not true right that's just not
true um what's actually going on is a kind of uh cascade of miracles moment to moment which we
probably recognize when we are infants but we soon become uh sort of um what's the right word like
immune to the awareness of oh over time you know when we're little we're like what's this body thing
wow i get one of these remember one of my dear friends who passed away in 2012 one of my ex-girlfriends
coco uh colleen yeager she said um i remember a scene from before i was born where i was shown that i was
going to be giving given a body and i was just completely overwhelmed with ecstasy i couldn't
believe i tried to figure out what i could possibly have done to be given one of these wow
and that's a really important i mean i love to honor coco she was she actually walked me through the
first time i was injured and took care of me and stuff um and was the only person in my life that
was doing that so i really want to honor her in this moment but this this brings us to other
other features we can explore well actually i have a couple bookmarked but let's continue
on the on the road we're on for the moment okay anything you uh care to add or um share i'd love to
hear so remember my question to you what would you and by the way you know if if it leads to tears or
whatever that's totally okay here with me if you're okay i'm okay crying is part of being human oh i don't
have control over that so okay good thank you right on i just want to i want you to feel safe and oh yeah
supported thank you i appreciate that no no reservations great so yeah anything you'd like
make um the people who anything else you'd like to to share or have the people who are still um
you know unimpeded know about like those of us who are healthy and whole what would you like us to
know i remember just that we're in an eden i mean there's nothing there's nothing more than that um
i also recognize that i i could not have realized that prior so i i also recognize that i might have
i was around people like me and there's always that you always hear people say oh it could never
happen to happen to me or i thought that um so i understand that there uh i understand that it's
really difficult to try that on um without going through something like this so and i i don't i don't
don't i don't know why like i i don't know if we're maybe not built to recognize that um like i there's
certain things that i realize now being disabled i had the same misperceptions of disability prior so i
can't blame people for not recognizing that
hmm perhaps yes yes this all makes sense to me the goal though
oh i don't mean to pick at the language maybe i should just no please do go for it okay um
when are we helped by blaming people so what we actually want is something other than the capacity
to blame them but i recall a long time ago uh one of my one of my old roommates a zen buddy of mine
was saying that he was really upset and i can imagine many i can imagine many other conservatives
saying something similar to this he was really upset that that uh our taxes were funding affordances
for people with what were then called disabilities he was like you know what
fuck those people man i work hard it's not my fault they're in a problem i i don't want to pay for
their you know so they can get it like why everywhere i go there's like a button so you can open the door
yeah and and i just looked at him and wondered what's gone wrong in your mind buddy um i won't name
him because i don't think it's kind to shame people but uh i really just had to pause and go like dang what
i think what i realized when i heard him saying that was actually that this didn't have anything to
do with people and disabilities quote unquote um or you know in modern more uh politically correct term
uniquely able people or something like this but um no it had to do with him feeling that he was
suffering deprivations that's what was going on right that he couldn't say you know i'm feeling that
i'm not getting my fair share or of human attention or freedom or help or whatever so why why are other
people being helped but um let's go somewhere interesting from this comment okay it'll never
happen to me correct well that's also um that's kind of what i posted about today is you know one day i
woke up realizing well i woke up not realizing that everything was going to be unimaginably different
in eight hours um and that's why disability rights should matter to everyone because it is a human issue
it's not a disability issue we will all be disabled at some point in time it's just when
does it happen oh such a brilliant point okay so i mean i can see like 15 science fiction stories
in my mind where joe goes to a bar he's drinking with his buddies like and those disabled people why
do they have all these affordances who cares about disability blah blah blah he gets in a car accident
on the way home is disabled and has to live through the rest of his life hearing what he was you know his own
right exactly comments ringing in his ears the point is we don't know when our ableness ends right we
presume it's eternal through our life because we've never been deprived of it right um and that presumption
is certainly wrong for all of us certainly wrong it's absolutely wrong yes so um not only in any
intelligent society okay there's they've discovered um recently i remember seeing some research some
papers published uh about the finding of a of some remains in antiquity um i think we're talking 10 20 30 000
years ago maybe 50 100 not sure where they found remains that implied that a group of people somewhere in
europe had carefully taken care of a member of their community that was clearly severely disabled uh if
i'm just going to use this this language i know there's new better language and whatever but i'm just
going to use this word because otherwise i'm going to have to double i'm going to have to question every
time i try to think of something i guess the other word that we're not supposed to use anymore is
handicapped um i come from you know i was born in the 60s so these these words are natural to me
and if people want to take me you know if they want to indict me for using them i'm happy to have a
conversation with them about it but yeah so they they found the skeleton that implied there was no way this
person could have taken care of themselves so it was very obvious that they had been taken care of by their
tribe or you know peer group and the the and and this implied okay this is kind of ridiculous we
moderns we have all these bizarre ideas about accounting games and shit right like you only
you're only really useful if you contribute value or something this kind of crap right which is
fundamentally wrong because well for all kinds of reasons first of all commodities aren't the basis of
meaningful existence not by a long shot secondly accounting games are a function of part of the
mind that isn't actually very human in a lot of ways uh and not trustworthy in how it departs from or
fails to enter into relational integrity with other beings and so forth we have these aspects of our
humanity that are clearly um to be very kind extremely limited in their ability to relate with or merge or
co-experience or uh empathize and it's weird when we hear this word empathy we think oh that's something
something someone does for someone else that's not what it is at all i remember some time ago i was
trying to cross the street and there was sort of a what appeared to be kind of a homeless couple pushing a
shopping cart they had a little dog uh on a on a leash and the man accidentally run it ran over the dog's
foot and it yelped and it yelped and when it yelped i felt pain that wasn't a service i was performing for
the dog you follow me oh that's i love that that is the specific example that you used because um i'm
taking a meditation teacher training course right now brilliant and they were yes uh and they were
the teacher was you know describing one of the core um lowercase t trauma with all humans is a feeling of
separation and we are wired for connection and the example he used for empathy is you know he was
walking down the street and there was a box of kittens on the side of the road and as the cars
drove by the kittens cringed because they were scared and naturally as a human you're going to
cringe too you don't have control over it it was a very specifically similar example yes oh brilliant
there's so much there what you've just said oh my god my mind is reeling with the possibilities of
where we can go here all right um so we have this this word empathize which makes it seem like it's an
action i do right it's not an action i do it's the same thing that happens if i start to fall down
and my and i and i try to rebalance my body it's not i'm not trying i don't it's not a thing i do it
naturally happens right it's the same thing as when um i accidentally place my hand on something
that's much hotter than i thought it it was and i and i recoil from it i don't have to it's autonomic
right well i to go back to some of those telepathic experiences i was telling you about please it's the
same thing it's it's your empathic nervous system responding to your environment and if you are
somebody that is a visual thinker it gives you images along with that but it's the same exact
tuning in to it's it's just your nervous system tapping into the environment around it
i played with that i tested it so i mean the the the empathic level of connection is
well yeah you know i um i mentioned uh coco she was a synesthete right so for her um sensory experience
had a variety of uncommon shadings and colorations and tactile senses and perhaps flavors and so
forth amazing i think it's natural actually we might all be more or less this way uh in other words
i think that we are each um in each moment of our lives a unique selection of the library of of
potential human faculties sensitivities and so forth what do you think about that i would
absolutely agree it's just what lens you get comfortable perceiving the information coming
in by but it's also i'm sorry go ahead no you go please well that was kind of it i lose my i lose my
track very very quickly i'll be sensitive to that going forward
um you were saying it's the lens
with which um
hmm well it's it's taken me
it i i find this continuously kind of disturbing um the the more i learn my particular perceptual lens
i think i know you don't take this for granted and probably a lot of the circles you run in people
don't take it for granted if you meditate a lot you don't take this for granted but i think a large
portion of the population takes it for granted that we're all perceiving in the same way
i'm so glad you said that and there's no chance of that being true it's no chance disturbing to me
so my my natural way of perceiving i i often forget i'm like oh this is not the natural way of perceiving
for other people um so i've learned so i would develop games to play with people to kind of see
if i could tap them into the same thing and perceive in different ways together um
yeah so like i would for example of one of those games and this is how i would kind of
uh play with telepathy so i was a hair stylist and so being a hair stylist i'm in close physical
contact with people all day long and it's very intimate very very intimate and i am a very very
visual perceiver so everything that's coming in through my senses i'm getting some sort of visual
symbols i don't want to say always a story but very strong images coming in and i noticed after a while
that especially the more i would meditate that i would tend to visualize
the information that my clients had not told me yet i was getting it prior to them communicating it
i don't think it's because i was picking up on something that wasn't experienced
i think i was just picking up on their nervous system experiencing it before they verbalized it
um so i would test this and i would say you know were you thinking
whatever like okay it was the man that did that action did he look like this and they'd say yes
whatever so later i wanted to experiment a little bit deeper with that and see if i could send it the
other way but i if someone's not trained to think like that how do i get them to think like that
so so people would fall asleep all the time in my chair or when i'm doing a scalp massage so they're
going to be dreaming so when people would fall asleep i would go oh okay this is the time and i
would really start concentrating on some sort of imagery and the majority of the time they would be
like oh wow i just had this dream of you know snakes in a jungle and i'm like oh did you surprise surprise
and it was me trying to really send that but i think that's natural i think it's just our empathic
it's it's i think it's natural i do too we can talk a lot more about that i want to um collect some threads
together here okay so i'm gonna try to make some bookmarks um telepathy your tattoo um
um oh that's a whole different we're gonna go there i know yes we're gonna go there um
hair okay hair hair hair or care h-a-i-r hair okay yep chair too but um surely you understand
that the hair is effectively like a well no wait let me let me let me start that sentence over again
if i could back up i would i would restate this um what do you know what have you heard or read
about hair being essentially a complex array of of extremely subtle and profound electromagnetic
antennae i have heard about it i what do you think about that what are your what are your thoughts
what are your feelings i don't what's your experience i don't know i don't have experience with that
my hair is very very long but i'm more i'm more interested in the nervous system response in the
scalp right underneath the hair which of course is receiving stimuli from the hair but that would be hard
for me to consider just from the moral standpoint of how often i took scissors to it all right so i'm
going to just i'm going to walk through a few perspectives briefly we don't have to pursue them
we can if you like um there are yogins who never cut the hair there are monks and nuns and
other sages who shave their head and these two states seem very importantly related to one another
it's not like one is better than the other rather it's that both of them are important and different
i remember the first time i shaved my head so first of all i was a huge proponent of just let my hair
grow leave it alone when i was younger um this was a problem because most males were expected to have
short hair um my father felt that you know this is part of uh learning to obey authority and so forth
if you Rice have to cut your hair also we should notice historically the at least in modern times um
the uh the idiosyncratic no way the right word uh it'll work but you know girls have long hair boys
have short hair right at least the 40s 50s 60s 70s things like this generally speaking you know
women uh don't cut their hair short and men don't let their hair grow long different uh there are
different customs in different places and times of course um so yeah i mean the earth's when i
think of the earth as a being i think of her uh like the van allen belts and the electromagnetic
her electromagnetic field kind of is her hair naturally i do and i felt you know that we
have this story of um samson and delilah right delilah cut samson's hair and he loses all his
powers while he's asleep as if the hair is sort of a con an umbilicus right now you as a hairdresser
as you said you know you may be disinclined to entertain some of these perspectives based on
the fact you know of how often you've taken scissors to the hair yeah the travesty right the travesty
and yet people select you to do that right they come to you for that and you're this sort of
telepath who while they're dreaming in your chair sends them images of you know snakes in the in
the jungle is that what you said yes that's a true story too and by the way the snakes in
the jungle doesn't that seem like the earth's hair like what about the treetops isn't that her hair
she has hair you know she has hair of various kinds well it absolutely is receiving signals without a
doubt i mean there's no no chance it isn't what happens when we're exposed to static electricity
humans have this phrase right yeah my hair yeah right my hair stood on end right you know you can see
people's hair go nuts if they're near a place where lightning is about to strike for example
um so yeah this stuff's real i i don't know exactly what to make of it i'm not trying to say
i'm not trying to tell people what to see think or believe but i have long understood that there's a
relationship between our energy bodies and i think there's probably more than one and more than one kind
of that and our hair um so i think it's amazing and fascinating that you have been a a hairdresser a
hairstylist um beautiful well i i for me well one this is totally separate it's totally separate note
um but it's something i tend to think of the evolutionary relationships and it drives me cry i actually i
don't want to go down this rabbit hole i just want to put it out there how it drives it's always driven
me crazy why are humans the only animal besides i think horses that have long hair that just keeps
growing like our hair keeps growing no other animal has hair that just keeps growing especially from an
out like if you're running around out in nature that's not helpful right but that's a whole other
like that's i don't know i don't think there is an answer to that like i've as a hairstylist i
research that periodically i have not found no convincing answer for that okay well let me be
clear about something most uh amazing answers insights well that's not true many amazing answers and insights
don't necessarily come from research in fact what research often catastrophically fails to answer
really pressing questions um what what i think often results in insight is something like what we're
doing here or what we're doing hair right i don't i don't have an answer to that okay so maybe i don't
actually want to have an answer to that no you you did actually yeah you did say something that gave
me the feeling that you might prefer to have to leave this question unanswered i just i just realized
that for myself yeah but i really loved that you introduced it nonetheless that you were brave enough
to introduce it and um i'm having so much fun in our conversation i want to just check in with you
how are you doing how are you feeling do you need something are you shall we continue where we can
continue it's funny um no i'm good great it's just funny that you said that at that moment in time
but no oh there's something oh i see i see i think i'm doing i'm doing disabled people things right
now i'm not going to say what they are i got you i can continue no i got the sense that something
was up and i needed to check in with you and i think that's very powerful because it um this
brings us also back to one of the things i forgot to bookmark that i meant to which is what i'm going
to call the third mind or the bird between the wings of us we think we're separate we think we're
separate we were trained to believe that we are separate that we've been severed away that like
being born as a human means you're all alone in this body you have no one can know your mind or
feelings or thoughts or concerns um you're totally alone in a sea of similar little isolated bubbles of
human of human experience and you're the most important thing in the universe humans are the you
know the the pinnacle of terrestrial evolution we're the thing that actually matters we're the only
intelligent ones around here and all these other ridiculous fictions what do you think about that
stuff i'm well i'm laughing i um
that's just profoundly nonsense to me it absolutely for okay on multiple levels first of all the fact that
where the most important thing is a disturbing pattern that i've i everyone wants to feel special um
i i i don't even know where to go with that one but the the disconnection thing is that's been coming
up a lot for me recently is connection not my own connection because especially after this situation
where i am a lot more alone than but i was alone a lot but i'm alone you know more frequently like once
again i was a hair stylist i was literally touching oh my gosh oh amber that's so crucial yes please
continue so i was literally touching other humans all day long yes um but i feel probably more
more connected connected now than i ever have um but that's that's more of a a knowing i don't have
concrete examples of that it's more of a knowing and a trusting but the fact that we're alone is just
absurd it is absolutely absurd you are never alone
there's a fascinating uh little feature of that word right which is a little bit schizophrenic to
remark upon all one you saw it you saw it coming yeah see we're doing the thing we're doing the thing
i can't believe you saw that yeah you knew exactly where i was going i have had experiences
where i drew all of my assets into one okay there have been two experiences that i can recall where i
drew the entirety of my being into one little compressed state like situation
and in different ways both times i felt that i was the only one
one only one in in the universe like in everything like i was completely all one
that's amazing and there's there's so many different things we can
explore here i don't want to lose our important threads but um
um okay yeah i have not had that experience by the way i i have craved that experience but i've never
had it fully so i'm this relates to our previous discussions so if you don't mind i will take a few
moments and elucidate about these okay um the first one was i was lying in bed okay i had been very
interested in what the hell sleep paralysis was because i had experienced it a few times and i do
think that although some people experience it uh look the the the the topology of human experience is
broad and and profoundly um that's the right way of saying it diverse right profoundly diverse it's not
the way we we have these fictions oh everyone experiences the same thing when they taste uh
strawberry or you know right right right right everyone knows what it's like to uh feel whatever
we have fictions of continuity things are always going to be the same though just like they were
yesterday i'll never be disabled blah blah blah you know we have fictions of universality and
fictions of generalization fictions of people having the same perception or experience which
clearly cannot be true it's not that we never do it's that we're the okay if there's a unity
it benefits from their being unique individuals participating in it right what any kind of unity
would benefit from having unique just like my hand is a unity right and each of the fingers they're all
fingers they look fingerly you know except the thumb is a little weird but they all they um and
there's that palm thing right where they come together it really matters they're not you know
people hold up their hand like how do you count this and they think five they're only counting the
separated parts what are they counting like they're kind of confused anyway what i'm trying to say is um
it's the diverse unity of profoundly unique members
that creates the possibilities of liberty in our hand in our thought in our relationships in our
world so if if everything quote everything's just one i'd love to see someone actually demonstrate
that to us i think it's true but when people make off the cuff casual statements like this very rarely
does it have anything to do with their understanding of unity or their capacity to embody it go ahead it's so
funny that you're saying what your last sentence because as you were saying that the whole entire
time i was trying to hold the conception of unity in my mind i i can't i it i it breaks apart immediately i
just i cannot do it i can't hold that concept you and i each have experienced and still in some ways
experience physical discontinuity of unity
yes yes um now i don't want to go to this is a rabbit hole that we can go down
but there's so many things i want to get to while i still have you we can book that mark for another time
we can book that mark absolutely yeah let's book that mark i don't even have unity in words right now
that's fine you're all good um i'm going to also make a note on that though something interesting that
happened um after the vipassana retreat is that same uh my language being in the right order started
falling apart just like that happened anyways yeah i am um highly sensitive to vocal music
and sometimes when i check in with you it it may be because i have i have sensed that your vocal
music is changing you are correct i want to make sure that you're okay and that you're you know that
you're feeling uh that we can continue i appreciate that so i'm going to be super honest right now okay
i use a catheter every four hours right and i was like can i do this while continuing this conversation
and i did and so you probably noticed that my vocal cadence went back to how it was before the activity
may i be similarly honest yeah it is not your cadence or your prosody that changed
it is the um tonality of your voice um it seems well what i interpret the tonality change to mean is fatigue
that's what i'm checking interesting i'm not fatigued yet although
i do go to bed pretty early so i'm probably beginning to
ride that wave into that habitual
place great i'm not i'm not i'm not feeling that need to be done but my body's naturally probably
beginning that process
okay so let's be sensitive uh feel free to let me know when you know if you feel the need to
for us to wind down for this uh session or whatever okay all right so back to some bookmarks um
in the indistinction oh there's so much i can say about that uh let's see here we're gonna we're gonna
transit away from that though okay see the humans we think we're separate and we think our minds are
in these separate little boxes inside our heads one of the most compelling oh wait i was gonna share
about the two times all right so once sorry this is a little a little disorganized once i was um
um the two times that i felt all one right is where i was going so once i was with my partner in bed
late at night and i um began to experience a phenomenon that i don't really entirely understand
and there's a word i could use for it that probably would come from recording or synthesis or something
um it's but it's a pulsing it's like a full body energetic pulsing
and on the down pulse on that sound it's as if all the energy in my body suddenly flushes out
so there's like a an up pulse and then there's this flushing of energy and at the at the bottom
of that wave it feels like all my energy is it's like the bottom of the wave right it's this trough
and i felt this a few times and then i opened my eyes and i looked around the room and i thought wow
everything is so clear
it was clear but it wasn't that everything was clear what it was was that i was seen in 360 degrees
and i could see my girlfriend asleep on the bed next to me the shape of her hair everything in the
room at once and i thought wow everything's so vivid right now and then the next thing i felt
was that i was the only being in the universe just nothing else but me it was kind of a very frightening
sudden all oneness right um and it wasn't it wasn't a bad thing it was just a such an unusual thing
right okay okay and then so i kind of recoiled from that i got frightened and um
and then i realized i am not sitting up in bed
i am lying down in bed my eyes are closed how am i seeing right now and then i woke up and then i opened my
eyes and all that changed was it went from 360 degrees of vision to common you know uh visual
perception for for a human with eyes that's amazing the first one of the first things i thought was
oh there's an entirely other way of seeing we could probably teach blind people how to do this
that was my first thing was like we could help the people who can't see
um because if there's some other way of seeing that doesn't use eyes my eyes were closed and i was
seeing the whole room for sure uh and if if that's possible then that go ahead i've heard of i've heard
from very very very experienced meditators not a lot but i've heard other people experiencing that
uh and they have described it to me where it's always right before waking up where it's almost
like you're going from this tunnel and you travel through these layers going from the oneness into the
diversity yep yeah the there's the two um liminal phases that are uh differently called um hypnagogia
which is on the way to sleep and hypnopompia which is on the way to waking hypnagogia i experience
frequently never experienced that uh traveling through those states um but i'm also not a very
experienced meditator so i don't know if that's just a particular um tuning uh to subtlety i would imagine
it is true i have also heard from meditators um but not uh only okay so you it sounds like you heard
from actual humans i've read in books um that oh yeah i heard from an actual actual human only one
actual human but i've also read it very yeah i've read in books that uh i'm sorry please continue tell
me no she's just um i wish hold on her name is hold on i'm so horrible with names
it's okay jack i mean jack o'keefe i think is her name i could be wrong but um she's someone that
i've sat with a couple times and to me this was um just her consciousness she has the ability to change
states of consciousness and meet each person where they are to which doorway they need opened so
yeah it's fascinating so actually um do you is it okay that i'm kind of going down veering yes you're
fine okay i'm right with you so i as you know i i worked at a ayahuasca retreat center for a few years
years um and i had before i went there i had this intensive phobia of vomit right so which is a common
part of ayahuasca experiences as i understand them never having had the experience myself yes so
i felt called which relates to something that i mentioned to you earlier i felt called to go be
at a center where they did this kind of work um but i was stopping myself from doing it because i had
a vomit phobia a very intensive i mean i went out of my way to avoid any activity where there could be
vomit if i had ever experienced vomit right right it was really bad so i'm sitting at this um
uh sit i guess just to sit and she is the meditation teacher and she's kind of
you know going through and kind of feeling like where each person needs to be like tweaked and this
is just meditation there's no and it's not even intensive meditation this is a one day class
um a sit and she's kind of going one by one and letting people ask her questions and the woman next
to me i don't remember what this woman's particular uh hang up was or issue um i think actually it was a
fear of expressing herself so this jack i think that's her name looks at her and she goes
okay can you just make a sound and she starts getting her to make this sound and this woman
kind of she gets louder and louder and louder and suddenly she starts violently vomiting
right next to me um and it's just she's just expelling energy and at this point i had not been exposed to
a lot of things at that point and i was like this is too much like this is way beyond my capacity to
hold this but then i went oh amber this is your biggest fear so i forced myself to sit i i got up
and walked away at first and then i said no no no let's go back let's sit next to her um but anyways
what i'm getting at is this woman had a capacity for moving consciousness that i've
i i don't know if i've ever met another human being that had that kind of capacity and she's
the only one i've heard say when she went to sleep she experienced that tunnel of you know the moving
from the diversity into the unity experience okay so now you've drawn us to the precipice of a cliff
i want to jump off of you right now wonderful and here's the precipice we've been trained to think our
minds are separate and i think in fact i'm nearly certain that this stuff we call thinking this is
like birds crawling around in quicksand on their backs this thinking is not what we're meant for
no this is not what our minds are for the whole thinking thing is a huge problem and it's it's really
like i know it's like fish trying to swim inside a rock and then wondering why it doesn't work well
i would agree and that when you i i had an experience um recently where i kind of experienced two
very different parts of my mind and i was kind of um uh vacillating in between them and i was kind
of being shown like this is what this part is and this is what this part is and when you mentioned
earlier the grasping nature um that to me is the thinking mind and that's all it is um there's so
many okay there's so much going on here let's let me try to tease some threads out that i think might be
profound so this thing we do when we're by ourselves and we're thinking i think that's mostly garbage um
it's very compelling and it it uh i honestly feel that it hates life it does it can't stand that
there's living things it doesn't like that there's actual intelligences what it wants is machines and
tools and devices and war and devastation and and the reason that it wants those things is kind of like
an ifs myth an internal family systems myth where a protector part goes insane after having trying to
protect everything from everything and i can go on about how that got set up but i won't and then it just
decides that in order to protect everything from everything everything has to die and just become
a dead inside thing that can be manipulated with a hand a kind of a mental hand and you know we might
be actually orbiting one of the most important things that ever was ever spoken about among humans right
here because this is the thing that can end planets right this isn't the thing that just up people it can end
worlds this thing um so
yeah it's a huge problem yes this okay i i i don't
the for me the symbolic representational part of it
is what has become dangerous um because it's like we are compelled everything that we are unaware of
internally we are compelled to bring it outside of us and interact with it externally
um like i'm not i'm not sure if if we i was trying to think about this last night like is did did that
part of the mind get created because of our hands and our ability to manipulate our surroundings or
well not or i know it's not just or but did we develop the ability to manipulate
our surroundings because of our mind becoming representational right right which came first
um the accident or the repercussions but my my experience of it what i was being shown
a few nights ago is that it's empty and it's hollow yes hungry it's oh god continuous yes yes
i'm starting to lapse into my almond hillman persona yes beautiful love it oh god um yeah okay so
here's what i think happened i think that all right i don't want to this is also a rabbit hole i don't
want to go too far down but you're the one who led me here the first time so i want to go a little bit
far down this rabbit hole and it does relate to your tattoo i think um well that is the rabbit hole that
has led me to all the rabbit holes but we never we didn't talk about that last time yeah we we did
talk about that last time oh i didn't tell you all of the things okay i agree about that um okay so
here's where i'm gonna go i think there was another i think we were born in the same way fish have water
and birds have the sky i think our minds were born for a relationship we don't have and it's a relationship
with something like angels and or non-human intelligences and or um what we might think of as
perhaps a collective of other intelligences like like a like a universe city a universe city which is
also a school a school in which all the books are alive and they teach themselves to you together in
the library now this is a very fantastical sounding arrangement i don't i don't think so if
since we last talked um i was so bothered by when when you said that disconnect from the relationship
of the sky i felt that in such a way in my being that i was like oh no no no this is i have i have to
do something about this so i took on um an astrology apprenticeship oh my god okay i love love it
it beautiful well there's there's there's a relationship there there's a prior relationship
there but i didn't i didn't dig very deep into it but there's this knowing that each of those places
in the sky there's a myth attached to it and when you begin these studies i it is undoubtedly
our mind is from that patterning there is yes no doubt in my mind oh my god i'm starting to see it oh
jesus now we're doing the thing that we did the first time i love this so much this is why i just i
love when when we get to make the bird together so to speak it's as if the the places in the sky are
organs in a body that our minds and spirits are the children of yes um and i can give you very strange
specific
examples um okay
and if you're an experienced astrologer this is normal language it's if now if you're casual you
you really have to get deep into the language but so the person that is my teacher calls it the you
know the um constellating the psyche so without a doubt it's that is what is creating the shape of
our psyche so for example um i'm now i'm gonna get to the snakes this has been i i have to get to this
let's go let's go um so the the reason i ended up at an ayahuasca center in the first place snakes the
snakes has been my guiding i follow the trail of the snakes so um the myth of do you do you know the myth of
asclepius tell me anything you want to share about it i know the name okay so we have the dream dream
temples where the greek dreaming temples where they would if someone needed healing they would
essentially you would go through these rituals and they would cleanse you and wait until you had a dream
representing it was time for you to go into the temple then you would go into the temple and you
would have you would dream again and the priests would interpret your dream for whatever healing you
needed wow so so the asclepian dreaming temples so one of the most common symbols and also this i'm
just gonna throw this in here the asclepian rod had one snake on it not two so the one of the strongest
symbols of the asclepian is the snake so a couple nights ago um with my situation i was like
all right i'm gonna try to enter into the i i would like permission to enter into the temple um via
dreaming so i just you know prayed i i asclepian like when it's time come to me and i don't know if
it was that night or a few nights later but i had a dream and suddenly there's just these snakes like
pouring out of the land just pouring out snakes and snakes and snakes and i was like oh okay and
then next in the dream um and keep in mind when i say healing i'm obviously i would like to walk again
that's what i'm talking about so um next in the dream i'm in a plane i'm not walking i don't walk anymore
in my dreams i my subconscious took that upon itself very very quickly and i i will do other things like
i will fly or i will roll but i do not walk so anyways i'm in a plane with a friend of mine that
i've met on the internet who's paralyzed and we are chasing a whale a humpback whale so the next morning
i woke up and i woke up and i thought okay i have asked for that symbol i'm going to go to this person
and ask him about this dream that i had because he was in my dream and he said oh i remember that day
that was the day that i say that was my favorite day of using my legs because i
was walking along the shore and chasing this whale and it was just the best day of walking that i ever
had so that that in itself is interesting but that's not the part about the constellating the psyche
so what is very interesting about that i was telling my astrology teacher um you know i'm i'm very
interested in the asclepian modality that part of the sky and he said oh that's very interesting um
if you had that dream you should see where the asteroid hygieia was in relationship to the moon
that night wow okay because hygieia is asclepian's daughter and she often is the one that brings these
messages oh almond hill would love this he'd be just like of course yeah so i went and checked my chart
and hygieia was conjunct my moon that night
meaning she was activating that part of my psyche that night the moon moves
constantly so if you understand astrology language you know that these planetary bodies are moving
constantly some of them move much faster than others but those two being right on top of each other
means that's what was coming through my psyche at that point in time meaning my psyche is attached to
what's happening in the sky yes yes i see oh my god um
okay there's so much so it's more like the sky is dreaming us yes yes yes yes this is exact oh
that's so beautiful that you said that i got this is my astrology teacher i have this is exactly what i
this is exactly what i'm trying to say in the recent essay the umbilical disaster why did i call it that
i called it that because our direct awareness of this situation disappeared and the absence left the
hole in us in our mind that was left is what became the grasping monster that owns our civilization
it's it's absence appearing as a presence it's trying to make up for what went away
right and the way it tries to make up for what went away is with techni technology
machines the dead inside things since it thinks that machines will bring back the thing that went away
it doesn't care about organisms or relationships or actual intelligences or anything it just wants to
keep making more machines it's a dead echo it doesn't know what it's doing right right it doesn't and this
protector part in ifs uh terminology jargon it it has been carrying we need to do ifs therapy on the species
or something resembling it so that we can talk to this aspect in the i agree the species level psyche
and relieve it of its burden i agree getting a call so can you still hear me clearly yes i can great um
um we need to talk to this aspect we need to hear its story we need to know its history we need to know
its pain its fear we need to reassure it that it won't be subjected to judgment and that we won't uh destroy
it we need it to go back to where it used to be before it became um distended and
uh so terrified that it wanted absolute sovereignty right this thing is tyrannical it's tyrannically
afraid in our species in the psyche of our species right oh my god there's so much here again we're
doing the same the same kind of magic we did the first time that we spoke well that's that's that's my
my my teachers would explain it is those were the gods and they have they're they they will live
through us whether or not we're in relationship with them but it's better if we have a relationship with
them um but obviously we we talked not that long ago and so after we talked i was like oh i have to i
have to understand this deeper i have to i have to go back into the relationship with this i'm so early
in that process that i don't i don't i don't quite know uh i'm not sure if it's just one the grasping
mind i see but i'm not sure if it's just one thing i think it might be many things that we
um need to be um need to be back in relationship with i think yes yes oh i agree um oh there's so much
here i'm like staggered uh okay so yeah this is one of the things that hillman says right he's like
this idea of monotheism is a poison yes there's no such monotheism there's no such thing um yeah
it's it's a poison it's tyrannical it it's similar to the problem of that aspect that took over the
psyche of our people at the species level thinking it's the only thing that matters i'm the only one
right yes yes also kind of similar to a certain guy whose name begins with t uh who we presently see
at play another guy whose name begins with p over in russia um i'm the only important thing i see it
on almost everybody um that's something else i've been thinking about a lot with okay we're talking
we talked about unity and all one that that is but diversity within that unity yes there's another
and i i i it's it's within me where i realize i am there is a part of me that is seeking
a unified coherence and i have realized that i that part of me i almost feel like that is a virus
and i see it expressed in other people where i'm like what is this drive for unity and singularity
it's obsessive um and it doesn't feel natural to me it's weird um this thing that's in the psyche
what it does is it counterfeits the virtues and then sells us broken versions of them at ever-increasing
prices and unity is one of the things it does this with so is divinity so is intelligence right artificial
intelligence i mean i'm not saying that's all bad but it's pretty terrifying it does like it does this
thing where it tries to build the ultimate of something and then sell it to us right the the
the phone that i'm communicating with you on is an excellent example of this that thing so closely
resembles what would have previously in in our ancestors been known as the the personal um protector
spirit it's the link to all other intelligences that we used to have we had we brought it with us
into birth here's the other crazy thing that i want people to know the answers to all these questions and
the and the histories of all of these mysteries are embedded in each one of us not not merely in the
way that fossils are embedded in the geological record that way too but but we experienced the
entire history of what happened to our species right from conception to infancy to childhood to adolescence to
young adulthood to adulthood and so on and we each experienced it uniquely so there's this thing we can
do together which is a sort of a magical form of archaeology and you and i do this naturally when
we're together this is probably part of why i was compelled to contact you in the first place i can't
imagine what you thought when some guy out of nowhere like reached out to me he's like hey amber i think
you know let's have a conversation but you know we so naturally have this ability together and i i honor
it and it's very precious to me i feel humbled around it i'm so grateful to be able to fly together uh for
a while now what you said in your dreaming was um that your subconscious mind quickly realized that you
don't walk in your dreams yeah okay i hate that for me okay okay uh i'm with you i understand why
that might be so um but i want you to just uh if you're willing agree with me so that your dreaming
mind can hear our agreement that it's okay for you to walk in your dreams even though wow what do you
think about that i agree with that right on i agree can you say it again though yeah you're completely
fine to walk in your dreams okay thank you yeah you're totally i had to i had to feel it yeah you're
totally fine to walk in your dreams your dreaming mind is trying to protect you and here's what i
want your dreaming going to understand to whatever degree this is appropriate for you where you are
where your dream mind is your dreaming mind is fully capable of protecting you even while you're walking
in your dreams there's okay yeah say it again your dreaming mind is fully capable of protecting you
even while you're walking in your dreams okay thank you yeah thank you thank you dreaming i'm hey dreaming mind
thank you i'm a dreaming mind we are aware of you over here on the wake and the other universe of the
waking world we're aware of you we honor your efforts where you're doing great it's awesome what
you're doing over there you're really trying to calibrate quickly yeah yeah you've done a great job
it's amazing we love you please keep being amazing in all the ways that you are
yeah that's amazing also the way that i can feel that in different parts of my body is amazing the
reason why i said it was a bummer is because i i'm friends with so many people with spinal cord injuries
now and a lot of them complain because in their sleep they're walking and they're mad they're like
well like do you ever wake up and think oh man i was walking and i was like wow like my subconscious
just went straight uh you know but that's a yeah just so you know my dream mind is well aware of my
vulnerabilities and injuries and so forth too and it often presents situations where where i can't do
things because the the injury is is it's conserved the understanding of my injury over time so it also
appears in my dreaming and there's other weird ways of traveling that are hilariously interesting
one of them is um this sort of bouncy high low grab low gravity jumping which is something one can do
in this game called halo that my dreaming mind was like hey you can we can do that let's do that right
it just jumps up like a hundred feet in the air in low gravity and slowly comes back down and then does
that again and another one is this weird sort of lizard like movement on the ground as if i'm
lizarding a skateboard so i'm rolling on the ground and i'm on my belly and i'm face forward and i like
sort of lizard skate and each um each twist each uh what is it snakes do they they writhe no there's another
word they they make the s they slither yeah each slither move accelerates the skating um it's very
strange i haven't done that in a long time but i remember the first time that happened to me i was
like what the hell kind of thing where did i learn that i was roller skating in a dream a couple nights
ago and i was doing it very very gracefully and i was like well thank you for doing that in a graceful
way at least i was having fun but i was still on wheels
beautiful
it is funny to me um okay there's so much more so
i i i have i i we we we might not be able to tonight i know um
i my my original
reason for wanting to connect i didn't
the snakes is just that's really been that that always comes up for me okay
i want you to test something not necessarily right now but just you know periodically there
so the the point in the sky where the the black hole is located that we are rotating around um
i can feel it at all times and i i test it i have an app i think it's called sky guide and you can just
like move your phone around and like see where everything is in relationship to you and i'll be
like okay where do i feel like that gravitational pull is coming from
and
and
usually pretty spot on i don't think that's unique to me i would imagine if other people tried it they
would realize oh wow i can feel where the gravitational pull is coming from
that is interesting to me because
that is also the part of the sky where asclepius comes from where ophiuchus comes from um which is a
man holding a man holding a large way what yeah no no no no yeah because
when i was trying to think up a name for a specific chapter in my essay
i of all this the names of star systems i picked that one
ophiuchus yeah the ophiuchy protocol well that's also that's where the mass majority of my astrology
chart is centered right like i'm i'm very uh not spread equally around the chart my whole entire
chart is uh rotating around that one gravitational point in the sky so i have a very strong
pull from that portion of the sky so i tend to also follow that it's like it has a frequency
and i'm like okay well i'm gonna go do that um but it's interesting to me because it's it's the
symbol of a man pouring a snake out across the milky way towards the earth okay this is insane
um so it's just it's snakes all the way down yeah i can't i can't get away from that and i can't
i don't know what that means yet but you said you wanted me to test something yeah
what that i can sense the direction is that yeah like if you had to guess like if you can feel that
gravitational pull like so i would i would argue that i can feel it there's a place in my body
that corresponds to it but this is a private matter that can't really be openly discussed
we will discuss this i can see that yeah i can see that fair okay interesting okay i need to i need
to just i need to reorient for a moment together okay last time when we talked
i had an experience that was it was as if you know what happens imagine the first time you ever
do you do you recall the first time you ever took a psychedelic drug hold on let me think uh
yes yes and that's yes um it was not a lot but that's definitely when i went oh crap external
perception versus internal perception like oh okay that's when i realized i was very much more
internalized than maybe other people that i'm around most of the time anyway a lot of people yeah okay
so the thing that's really weird about the first time you take a psychedelic but it does happen every
time you take a psychedelic is that it's like somebody drips a little droplet of transcendent light
into the mirror of your soul oh and it goes like and then it starts to spread out on the surface
and the interior of that mirror slowly and as it spreads time warps and then time transforms dramatically
the feeling in the gut transforms dramatically
there's all these transformations that start occurring simultaneously dimensionality changes
time changes time changes what it means to have a mind starts to change all these things changes
excuse me all these things change but with us what happened was when we spoke
very uniquely it was as if you dripped a little droplet of something transcendental into my soul
and then over the intervening span between that conversation and this one
one almost everything that i did creatively had the sparkle of that droplet expanding within me inside it
yes yes yes and that is so beautiful i just want to honor that how precious and rare this is
how profound that has been how profound that has been for me many of my recordings i can't believe that i
actually picked the right star system for one of the scenarios that i present in my essay the ophiuchi
protocols and it didn't occur to me that this oph oph particle in greek is snake
it didn't occur i didn't know it consciously
but it's it's a fascinating part of the sky as well it's it's
it's in there for a reason i know but this is the thing like we get guided by intelligences that aren't
ours i think one of the things that fascinates me about hillman is that hillman has fully submitted
to such guidance oh interesting i will say that i have as well
um it's that part of the sky
i i
because i can't be sure you're not saying it's that part of this guy
um right it's the sloppiest for example right it's that part of the sky um because the sky and
the sky sound the same in english they're really right right right right differentiate
um okay so now i want to tell the other time when i felt completely all one
in 2009 i had a bad day um i was stretching i felt as if i had been subjected to a magical spell
of some malevolent kind briefly and i was stretching and i tore my injuries
spot while i was stretching and then i knew i could make it home but i knew i probably wouldn't
leave my house ever again um i thought it was very unlikely that i could heal from the injury a
second time so i walked home about so in 2002 i had the first experience of this intelligence that i
call toy maker which is very complex to try to describe if someone asks me what it was um
because it went through phases at first it seemed like me then it seemed like an alien then it seemed
like an enclave of alien intelligences then it seemed like a cherub a small angel then it seemed
like an archangel um it went through phases right and so what it is it doesn't actually matter i'll never
know what it is whatever it was or is is outside the possibilities of language and human lexicons and
reference itself but um i had this experience in 2002 for nine months and in 2009 when i re-injured myself
uh in september by the time we got to december something very similar started happening in my mind
again that wasn't there was a secondary intelligence that was teaching me in the way that toy maker did
and i thought oh toy maker is returning i also noticed the correspondence between
tribulation i'm in a crisis and the activation of this extra intelligence right um about three months in
and i became very concerned toy maker had warned me uh if it said it didn't never spoke it just
it directly modulated my consciousness to produce effects which is totally different from speaking
i didn't even know such a thing as possible i think you might have been doing that when you were
putting dreams in your air dressing minds while they were sleeping um but yeah i directly manipulated
my mind and it showed me that i should be careful and what it said was you you haven't seen me there
are other things like me not all of them are benevolent and the second thing was very much about
wanting to connect to the humans it wanted to use me it seemed to me it wanted to use me like a radio tower
to connect to the other humans and unlike toy maker there was no evidence that it loved
with toy maker there was evidence that toy maker loved and toy maker also had a sense of humor that was
really hilarious and very much not um like uh what's the right word had no shadow its humor had no shadow
it wasn't like explicit humor or i always preferred the comedians that could make me laugh really hard without
um without swearing or referring to sex for example right and toy maker's humor was innocent in this way
it was beautiful and innocent and the second thing did not have humor and it didn't seem to love
what it had was hunger it wanted power right and so about three months in by the way i wrote
the first time i wrote a lot i have all that material and some of it's on my website organelle.org
i don't write about the experience i've rather what i learned because i don't think humans are likely to
believe what happened to me so i rarely talk about that experience but um
the second time i wrote sort of an opus right i wrote this essay with one essay for every letter
in the alphabet so there's you know there's like 27 or 28 essays in this thing called sky book
and um i was recording what i learned with both with toy maker and with the second
and intelligence but about three months in i realized that i didn't trust this thing
and it was merged with my soul spirit my intellect so i had to figure out a way to evict it
and my soul seemed to know what to do it was a process that took many days of doing no other
things laying still doing one thing which was sort of collecting my essence into a seed and then
purifying the seeds so that only me was in there right all one alone and um i did that and i think
this is probably what happens at death i think there's a sort of a transit body that is forged it's
very pure in a way it can't be adulterated so i did that and when i was finished then that other
intelligence was gone i don't know if i did the right thing i had no one with which to discuss with
whom to to discuss my decision or perspectives i just had to do what i felt seemed best um so that's
the other time when i felt all one i felt completely alone in the universe when i had composed that
seed and it wasn't it was a it was a sad feeling it felt sad um but i did it and it was important i
think that i do it um i want to mention to you because you spoke about asclepius and you spoke about
dreaming and the snake and the healing dreams right my friend um on facebook sarah james do you know about
her i don't think i do okay so she's in greece and she is someone who's fascinated by dreaming incubation
the asclepian the asclepian the greek rituals of asclepius she's a very interesting person you might
i will send you a link i mean i think it's good to mention her for anyone who's listening yes um because
she's like she does dream incubation in the places in greece where it was done amazing um yeah yeah so
you can probably learn something from her or perhaps even speak with her oh yes i would love
that i'm sure she would love to to meet you and know of you yes i'm very interested and um for for
some reason that's why i felt like the ayahuasca was the modern not modern i mean it's just people are
doing that currently so i thought oh this is it's there's also a snake relationship there too but
what is it um a lot of times well the the medicine comes from the amazon and there's
that the snake is often what's symbolized is um a lot of times people will get visions of a large snake
coming when the psychedelic takes over you know don't you that um it's very common in india when
the yogis and gurus are sitting what happens you know about this the kundalini no the cobras come
oh no i love it um so i i would i was attracted to that because i was like oh this is a modern day
asclepian like it's happening right here um and they're just using uh medicine instead of the dream
incubation rituals but with my injury um i'm not i still have a lot of interest in pursuing some version
i i think no matter what i do in life i will be doing some version of whatever that is so right now i'm
kind of um i'm just very interested in kind of recreating these rituals in modern times yes between
amon hillman and sarah janes and my friend lee gerard barlow who's a mesmerist and has also studied
similar things we should be able to come up with an elixir right i don't necessarily mean a substance
but like a situation where we can do this uh preferably no substance that's right that's what
i'm realizing yeah yeah absolutely it's i'm i'm realizing when you have a material just becomes
part of if well you know it's just not it you and i didn't need a substance
right we made a substance this is the thing that i think the humans have forgotten and it's something
that hillman talks about but even he i think is confused he thinks the humans made substances by
introducing the venoms of snakes to their bodies those i mean they might have those women they scratched
their skin and they and they dip these bandages in complex venoms and they became immune to them and
then they could produce their bodies became pharmacies right which okay brilliant i love it beautiful yes but
what i'm trying to say is what i want us to remember is the capacity to make substance that is
not a substance it's trans substantial it's made with our our spirit our passions our curiosity our um
our catastrophe sometimes right together yes like you and i have been making and and like i have been
overwhelmed by since we last spoke now look i don't want to give the wrong impression i'm not over here
obsessed with my conversation with amber or even with you i believe in you i i i think you're so courageous
and brilliant and amazing and i want to learn with you that's true yeah but it's not me it's right
and i'm not me either that's the spot the spark i know what you're talking about with that spark
yeah i know that spark yes it's i know that spark i do too yeah yeah i don't want to get i don't want
to give people the wrong impression because i could sound i could you know obviously listeners could think
whatever they might suppose to think but there's something very profound that's going on here that's
beyond me and you um and in a way it's even above the humans as a species and this is the point where
i want to ask you two questions first how are we doing on time and your thoughts what do you think how
much time have we got um i would say no more than 20 minutes i'm starting to lean towards wanting to get
some water not not you know immediate but eventually um okay uh can you get some water now well i is it
gettable i could as a paralyzed person it's going to take me a good six to seven minutes
i hear you what what is your desire i'm good right now okay so um let's talk about something strange
that we've hinted at a couple times um you have a tattoo yes and um the tattoo has some
words underneath it but the word mind which i think is underneath your tattoo do i remember correctly
yep that word doesn't mean mind it means something more like body doesn't it or have i got that
backwards uh well
i don't think you have it backwards
i think i i think i wow i can't believe i'm gonna say this go for it be brave
well i also didn't quite fully realize this but wow i there is wow there's an aspect of me that i
experience that's not on the earth yes
yes yes and that feels strange to admit but when i'm hinting at all of these
things these symbols that i follow or this thread or this spark it's all the same origin point um
so that part there's there's this common tale it's weird i was listening you know at rehab this week
there pop it's in pop music you know you fell from the sky like you're a fallen star it's it's this it's in
us it's in this story and that's the origin point that's the spark that i feel like you're talking about
um and so i i i don't fully experience it the way that you're saying it but if i had to
really zoom in to the spiritual level of the experience that would be it um it's not my primary
experience but there is an experience the the part there's a part of me that's not on earth um
and that part of me
that is not on earth
i can't believe i'm saying this is very disturbed
by the way the mind is functioning in this body yes because it's a series of traps
it doesn't know what's going on okay yeah i'm i don't want to presume it's certainly trapped trapped
certainly is the word yes yes yes and why would my why would my organ girl my organ girl amber
be subjected to a labyrinth of painful traps that's wrong that should never have happened
something has gone haywire it's the same for darren why should my you know i've often um proposed that
we are like we're like the spiritual inversion of the the image of a child with a kite
right time space has this little string along which it descends into birth
as in matter right the whole spiritual constellation of the origin beings and time space
they swirl around they form this little thread and down here on earth out comes darren and darren lives at the
other end of that thread the whole time and there's two-way communication but darren they all remember
they all know what's going on darren has no idea what's going on he's in a series
of weird traps that we often refer to with the words thinking and language yes yes concepts that's the
experience concepts and money those two things concepts and money commodities and and tokens of
reference and why would that be true because darren's nature has nothing to do with any of that nothing
so what happened and one of the things that i think happened is that the two-way nature of that thread
got compromised around here and so now they know what's going on but we don't and the absence of them
in us produces the traps that they are upset about oh i mean i'm gonna have to stay with that for
for a while um sure so will i i mean i've been sitting with everything from our last conversation
just bubbling like a little pot boiling over on the stove so i'm looking forward to a lot more bubbling
well that that is why i signed up for that astrology apprenticeship because i was like okay
this i have to get back in relationship um but there's okay i i i'm beginning
uh i'm beginning to feel like i have some concept that's it's forming i don't know if i can fully
articulate it um oh gosh and while you were describing it it's like i was getting a
uh a vision of this this thread this kite this experience
it's as if we have the memory
of everything
within us
um
um
but there's perhaps i wonder it feels like there's a memory where there's not it's not
happening in linear time it's just one
and that is what that experience is i can't i don't know how to articulate it um
i feel like there's lost experiences
that we are acting out um that are
that are from our history i don't i don't i i really don't know how to say these things oh you're
doing great you're doing great amber you got it you just nailed it keep going well that's just what
it feels like and i think the same damn thing we are recapitulating waves of historical memory
that we are unaware of that are crucial to our awakening and they have nowhere to go
anymore yeah yeah yeah yeah so so what's hard for me is when i look at that as one experience i'm not
quite sure if it's one experience or many like it's i i don't i don't know how many different
experiences are in there asking to be brought forth it's oh my god what if our lives oh my god amber
you do this all the time when we're together it me up i want to be up this way this
is like a car wreck of insight right it's like a dumpster fire of just cascades of
unforgetting and that's what i'm after the greeks had this word anamnesis
and what if our lives are the physical anamnesis of our origins the story
of the catastrophe the accident that separated us from the sky and our originary our companion
intelligences and our lives are this story and the story is being physically played out as us in
human bodies i don't think there's an alternative i don't do i i don't think there's any other way
love you oh my god yes i don't think there's any other chance for an alternative but i what i think
is so fascinating is i i really think if you had this discussion with an experienced astrologer the
way that they can articulate like no it's for sure we are being lived out through these the reason why
those myths exist in the first place is i i don't know i don't know
okay um i waves of of time space are crashing on human oceans and producing the lives that we live
and those are waves of memory and one of the most crucial features of that memory
is the catastrophe that separated the material from the transcendental and the originary
and that catastrophe is unresolved it's unresolved in the transcendental and it's unresolved in the
physical and that's why the gods themselves are trapped the gods are trapped it might be up to us to
free the gods from interesting
like that is very interesting do they dream do the gods dream or is that our power
we are their dream that's what i've heard other but this the the unresolved part that's really
that's that's setting in with me um because we keep having these uh uh every everybody always the
world's always gonna end right right always so what why does this story keep coming up what is that
where is that coming from why is this so alive yes chaton and the apocalypse yes by the way let's be really
clear about something basic every single time we wake up the dreaming mind experiences an apocalypse
a real one the world ends at that moment it ends it's gone and not only that the dreaming mind doesn't
have like the kind interesting the line of continuity that the waking mind establishes and defends and
protects and uh you know thinks is really important that continuity it doesn't have the dreaming world
doesn't have that the dream mind has to be composed anew each time it originates most of the time not
it's not a law it's a principle there are exceptions there are exceptions right you can have sequential
dreams that elaborate previous themes you can have dreams over many nights or even over many years that
that repeat certain themes or are connected to each other but not in the way your waking mind
has continuity over time right your waking identity um so the dreaming mind knows i think uh death and
apocalypse intimately and i also think it's really curious about what brings the apocalypse why each
morning what is that thing on the other side of sleep that puts the dream to death
what is that why does that have to happen why who is that over there who is the dream assassin this
is my personal language right who is the apocalypse bringer that pushes the button often with violence
or fear or there are other things it can use explicit identity actually is one of the things that feature
of consciousness uses to end the dreaming because explicit identity is anathema to dreaming think about
that over here explicit identity is the rule and we're totally familiar with it i'm darren of course
i'm darren because my identity is explicit really you sure how do you why the dreaming mind isn't like
that at all it can't it can't abide explicit identity one time my dream mind was like let me show
you how anathema explicit identity is i went to an airport which is a specific kind of situation in the
dreaming mind and they asked for my id and the dream just collapsed right oh right because they're like
yeah what's your show me your explicit identity interesting
okay um
have you ever used a cell phone in your dreams oh this is a really important story
which i'm not i'm there's so many things i want to ask you before we wind up that i'm gonna make it
really quick okay so i when i was trapped in my house i started using i i i i'm a technician i studied
the effects of electronic technology on human relationships and minds and i explicitly refused
to have us us anything like a cell phone until 28 26 late 2016. um i i needed to study it because
i had seen how the internet fucked up human minds and relationships and i knew that the cell phone was
going to be much worse so i got what i got was an ipod right an ipod with a screen that i could run
like skype and a couple of apps on and i used that and that showed up in my dreams immediately
like within a week showed up in my dreams why did you ask and what's your experience because i've never
successfully used a cell phone in my dreams yes i think it's really important okay yeah that's such an
important fuck that's such a beautiful important point remember when i said that the smartphone
represents the uplink to the sky intelligences it's the representation of that uplink and the fact
that we have that and we built it as a species is very interesting and something we should explore
deeply in a conversation that is very interesting let's bookmark that for another conversation but but
how how do i stare at this thing all day and i've never successfully used it in a dream i cannot
use it in a dream it does things up it shows up in my dreams pretty commonly these days
um even after i got it i refused to take it outside for a long time i would only use it in the house
uh we'll go through all of this but okay but i do
i do i do use it in dreams yeah this is such a crazy topic okay i want to come back to your tattoo
okay okay so what does it say under your tattoo that's where is my mind great and what is the
describe the tattoo for the listeners it is an angel its wings go up my rib cage
um but the angel body does look like an alien um like bald and large larger eyes you know this
traditional what people think of and it's in the fetal position wow um just occurred to me that what if
the hair what if all the hair that the aliens have is inside them instead of on their surface
like you i i i mean i would i tend to think of electricity a lot i
and i think that extends forever and ever and ever outside of the body but remember how you said that
you're so much more internal than other people yeah yeah what if yeah there's something here i mean i am but
okay when did you get the tattoo and tell me anything you want to share about it the day i turned 18
oh my gosh okay wow okay um so there was in me this knowingness of this deep deep depression and
angst i mean i know most a lot of teenagers are angsty um there was this knowingness that it was the mind
the mind is the it's just not right why is this this is not right and i was sending i don't know how but i was
and i in my heart of hearts felt like one day i would be okay and i would be on the other side of that
and i was sending a message to my future self saying don't forget me wow do not forget where we came from
so profound okay so
i'm gonna go back to where you said something like
we each of us come from a specific place in the sky this totally reframes the nature of astrology
humans think astrology is about using a sort of a clock like algorithm to make determinations about
characteristics and situations what if we've got that entirely backwards what if what if astrology is about
the recovery of the string that links us to origin
beyond the earth that is the uplink to the other intelligences the originary intelligences
that i call transcendent
i i do think that is the the point of it um the the many many intelligences i i think
i think when ancient civilizations had a relationship to that they were honoring they were being blatant
about that honoring of i think they had a strong awareness that that's where those intelligences
came from or is that how our intelligence got programmed i don't i mean i i haven't been able to
figure out which direction it's coming from the most astonishing thing to me is that i finally realized
something that i think i've known my whole life subconsciously but haven't been able to say
my mind was not made for thinking it's made for relationships right it's made for telepathy
and a thing we don't even have a word for which is the composition of communal minds with people
like you right it's made for flight it's not meant to it's not like a fish trying to swim inside a stone
it's meant to go it's meant for the far vistas of possibility and anamnesis right well that explains
the tattoo i mean that's why that being is so depressed right right there it's trapped it's trapped
yeah trapped yes yep yep was never meant to be like this yep never every single human that has ever
lived has known the stink of the prison cell
the stink of the dungeon yep and that that that feeling when you say trapped that is exactly the
angst that was coming through oh my god we have we have given the word remembering an entirely new meaning
here today amber and i i mean i'm humbled and grateful this is so precious to me
there's i can't imagine having something having done something better with the time that we shared
i honestly can't i really i i appreciate it as well we still did not get to my snake questions but
eventually let's go there soon okay yeah i have i have i i had some realizations last night about
the symbolic nature of that in regards to shamanism and the underworld but next time yes
yes for now i mean i have plenty of energy for more but i'm sensitive to your situation and
your need for hydration and my mind my mind is fading out anyway yeah yeah okay
thank you dear heart i'm so grateful for this time together and
i hope we can reconvene again very soon thank you darren all blessings to you may your dreams be rich and
filled with healing all right good night good night
