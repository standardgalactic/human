great hi Venetia hi Darren good to see you it's wonderful to see you I'm so excited to have a
chance to talk with you I've been aware of your work for many years uh we met through my dear
friend Henrietta and um so yeah I'm just I'm really excited I think what you're doing is
astonishing um and brilliant and human and heroic and so I'm just so I'm just so happy to have a
chance to uh introduce others who may not know about you or your work to what you've been up to
okay well that's uh makes me uh makes me feel a bit humble actually I don't I mean what I'm doing
is just I just kind of I don't know just seem pretty obvious thing to do really so anyway if only it were
a pretty obvious thing to more of us yeah well I do there's a lot of people who do this kind of work
too um well not a lot of people but a few a few people that I work with who are amazing who so um
why don't you take a moment and just uh tell us a little bit about your work and we'll start there
okay well um so I didn't become an attorney until I wasn't an attorney until 2017 um so I have a long
history of different careers prior to that um but I went to law school in 2014 I was 43 uh when I went
to law school and at the time um I had had a business in New York and I you know lost it and
in the crash and I didn't have any further education so I'd gone to community college
and I'd never even my wildest dreams ever imagined becoming a lawyer um but almost immediately I started
at community college it just popped into my brain that I could become a lawyer which up until that
moment I didn't even know was anything I had an aspiration to do um and I think I had a lot of
angst about having had a business fail and I hadn't maybe not lived my best life uh for a number of years
and so I felt I had a I felt like an obligation that I had a duty to do something to help other people
um and so that's kind of I went into wanting to be a lawyer that way um and I was always very
kind of fascinated and horrified by the American criminal justice system and so I always wanted
to help people um in in the particularly and originally with the death penalty um but as I became
more um educated I became more concerned about life without the possibility of parole so basically I
wanted to help people who had these sentences um because really there's no one helping any of these
people and so I I started kind of through law school being really interested in that and I got to work on
a clemency petition when I was a law student for a man who had life without the possibility of parole and
he did eventually get released um and so when I uh after I graduated law school I just went dived right
into the world of clemency which is essentially begging for mercy and so that is what I did uh for several
years and we had the good fortune to have an amazing governor in Oregon during those years um and so
I was able to get um quite a lot of people um out of prison through uh clemency um and then I kind of
expanded out into helping people with parole and now I work with people um who have constitutional
challenges to their conviction whether their rights were violated um helping people get out of prison
is basically what I do wow that's amazing um give me just a moment I'm going to shut my windows so
that we can reduce uh traffic lights here sure um there we go
so tell tell us a little bit about your first attempt
to to affect somebody's life path who was in prison right well um the first person was when I was a law
student um and he was a guy who had been in prison for about he'd been in prison since my 21st birthday
um and then which just blew my mind the idea that just how long a period of time that was
um and he you know it was my first time that I'd really gone into a maximum security prison
and my first time actually getting to talk with um a prisoner or someone who'd been in prison for a long
time and so um and you know it was the first time I got to interview someone about their life and you
know it's just some right from the beginning it's just it's always just such a just so many tragedies
wrapped into one usually is what you when somebody gets to a life sentence in prison most of the time
it's nothing like the movies and it's nothing like any book you've ever read it's just somebody who
every bad decision that could be made on one day and every bad bit of timing it's like this
perfect storm of badness happens and then this tragedy occurs um and so that's kind of what really
affected me at the beginning and then what really inspired me was that to imagine you know because
generally the consequences of your action when someone gets killed or someone gets murdered is
you you know obviously 10 times worse than maybe what you intended um so you're paying you know you've
done this unbelievably terrible thing and you've taken a life which is really just just a horrific
thing to have done um and then how do you find meaning in your life how do you how do you sit in
a prison with a sentence like that and not go into a world of darkness and instead become a good person
and try and be a great citizen and I found I just was inspired and overawed by um the first person I met
story of of how he had lived his life in prison and the person he had become under those circumstances
and so I was very inspired by that and of course I wanted to work with more people and and learn a little
bit more I mean I guess it was a sort of massive curiosity as well and and also I suppose empathy and
concern about would I have the character to make something of myself under those circumstances or would
I give up or would I just lean into darkness which a lot of people do so that was my first my first experience
and it took us several years for him to get out I think it was about five years of work before he
eventually walked out of prison but he did so yeah what was that moment like well unfortunately so I he
I was on that case as a law student so he wasn't my client and he he ended up getting out of prison and so
I was really happy that he got out but I had tons of my own clients get out by that point
so I can kind of talk at the beginning when I first started as a lawyer I graduated law school
took the bar and then three days later I started my job as a clemency attorney
and at the time we decided um because Governor Brown was herself a woman um and she wanted to
she had some problems with prison overcrowding um and she had kind of mentioned to us that if we could
find 20 women that were commute people who they she might commute that would really resolve her problem
and at the time she had said just find me people who've done low level kind of identity theft stuff
um you know there's something low risk for her but what we felt was that there was much higher risk
for her to commute someone who's uh maybe in and out of prison because for political purposes so we
actually chose to uh work with lifers um and so the first people I worked with were all women
um who had killed generally speaking a you know a husband or a domestic partner often there was a lot
of um abuse that had led to these crimes and so I mean I can tell you the first time that I got a
commutation I was shaking and crying and sobbing I couldn't even like barely tell her I was shaking so
much I could barely dial uh the phone into the prison to let her know um so I was an emotional
wreck at the beginning with every case um because it was just so just unbelievable that someone was
going to walk out of prison it you know if you've worked in the system for a while you realize what
a miracle that is so yeah I was I cried a lot at the beginning now I'm all jaded and uh you know I
don't have those I don't have such extreme emotions anymore you know that's uh that's funny to hear
you know I had um when I asked you the question and still and now I feel myself pretty choked up
um just to hear about these things uh there's so much
there's so much emotion in my own life um where I have felt you know I've had very deep feelings
about the problems in what is ironically in the United States called the correctional you know system
um and for reasons I don't entirely understand perhaps it's just that I'm a human being and I'm
I'm empathic uh I just have I just feel like I have a lot of feelings about prison and um how laws are
handled and what you know the American system of what we call justice which seems pretty bizarre
and that's something that I want to explore with you um but yeah even even just trying to talk about
it right now I feel kind of choked up and I think um it's partly because I'm so uh I have such reverence
for what you've been doing um it's it's almost as if you've fulfilled something I've had a dream about
you know in my or at least a feeling in my heart about ever since I was very small once I realized
what was going on in prisons and what they were about and all this kind of thing um
but so that we can continue down a reasonably organized path okay how did you come
to be how did you become a clemency lawyer and and did someone hire you talk about the early days
oh yeah um well so I went to law school I went to law school and I had a very specific like most
people just go I think they go to law school to become a lawyer and I I weren't very specifically
wanting to help people who other people wouldn't help um I'm not that was just what I decided that
I felt like I had a debt to society that I needed to pay um and so that was kind of my mindset and I
remember saying to myself the whole time I want to be in the trenches I want to be in the trenches
I don't know what I meant by that but that was kind of my mindset and so I was lucky um I went to
Lewis and Clark Law School which is I think objectively the best law school in Oregon and about a year before
I got um started applying to um law school um Elisa Kaplan um is a who is a former uh Innocence
Project attorney one of the she was the director of the Innocence Project in New York um nationally
at one point and she was semi-famous she had sort of worked with Barry Sheck from the inception of the
Innocence Project so she moved to Oregon to work at the law school and so I knew that she was there and
my I was determined to go and work with her and I think when I was when I was an undergrad I wrote
my thesis about life without parole and the death penalty and I think I was really interested in
innocence um at the beginning but that kind of I moved away from that and I felt that the Innocence
Movement kind of essentially sucks all the oxygen out of the city so all the kind of reform focus goes to
this idea what about Innocence Innocence and of course Innocence is a big deal it's a horrific idea
that someone innocent is in prison but I think the problem with that is that we tend to then focus
too much on the guilty people deserve what they get we're going to focus on the innocent people
and I kind of wrote my undergrad thesis um on kind of the unintended consequences of the abolitionist
movement and one of those unintended consequences was after the death penalty was ruled unconstitutional in
1972 and then it was reinstated in 1976 legislatures across the country added in LWAP as a punishment
for death before then it was either death or life and what that meant most of the time is that juries
are just human beings and most most juries aren't comfortable condemning someone to death and so it
would be life 30 was the more popular punishment and death only for those most extreme uh cases and
they added in LWAP and that's life without the possibility of parole and that became a very
palatable punishment for juries to hand down and so there's this massive movement of hundreds or
hundred thousand people suddenly with LWAP sentences in America where before the death penalty was ruled
unconstitutional there was maybe three or four thousand people and so I became very focused on LWAP because
people who are sentenced to death have an enormous amount of litigation opportunities to get off death
row whereas people who have LWAP tend to have pleaded to LWAP or have been sentenced to it and then
they're just stuck in prison so I became much more focused on those people before I got to law school
and there were so few avenues for relief for them when I learned about clemency I think I learned about
clemency from ELISA when I was a first year law student it spoke to me and the reason it did is
because on a really obvious level I have received so many second chances in my life most specifically
getting to go to law school in my 40s and I've made tons of mistakes and I've been given more chances
and that's what clemency is and so I immediately knew that I wanted to be involved in in doing
clemency and trying to help people with these LWAP and life sentences get relief it just it was obvious
to me you know and so that's how I got into it and but there was no jobs there are no jobs for
clemency lawyers there's no right to clemency there's no constitutional right for a lawyer but
but ELISA who was the professor at the law school I went to work for her the whole way through law
school we did a death penalty cross study together and she got funding to hire me as the first clemency
attorney of her legal clinic right after I left law school so that's what I did and I'm very very lucky
that I had ELISA in my life because otherwise I mean I was the only lawyer in Oregon who was doing
clemency full-time there was no one doing clemency other than me really at the beginning I mean once we
started having success more people started doing it but up until that point clemency was dead it
had been dead really since Willie Horton remember the Willie Horton affair oh my goodness yeah yeah that
kind of squashed the desire that people had to do clemency it's politically dangerous for a governor
there's no upside for them and with the war on crime and the 90s and the whole political culture
in this country no political leader really wants to look like that he's soft on crime you know
presuming that clemency means soft on crime but yeah it doesn't but that's how everything's perceived
yeah exactly that's how it's fun yeah wow um that's so amazing so in a way you could say that you actually
pioneered the re-emergence of clemency well I would ELISA would probably want to get in on that um
sure I mean I think they were doing clemency up in Washington the state next to us and the first cases
I worked on as a law student were up in Washington and they had this clemency uh process in place that
had been they had kind of like a clemency board like a parole board and people could apply and it was a
process that the governors were using up there um especially and and so but there was nothing in Oregon
and so ELISA definitely saw an opening um that with Governor Brown that maybe she would be interested
although she had no real background in the criminal justice system and we definitely worked very hard
over a period of years to get her to grant them like we got the first three years I felt like
I felt like a snake oil salesman you know I'm going into the women's prison I'm enlisting these
women who are amazing what we believe to be amazing candidates I'm getting them to tell me their whole
life story and dredge up every painful moment in their lives I'm writing their story I'm giving them
hope in a place where hope is dangerous and then Governor Brown would deny deny deny and then I'd have
to go back in the prison and break their hearts and it was I was so demoralized I felt like the worst
lawyer in the world oh it's like by the end of 2019 I had just not had one person except I'd had a
juvenile uh get relief or two juveniles but they weren't really I mean they weren't really with long
sentences they were just kind of easier cases for the governor and I felt I remember feeling like this
is awful I can't keep doing this anymore and then in February 2020 she granted our first big DOC petition
and it was the most exciting day I can ever I mean one of the most exciting days of my life but I felt
I mean it was I was just so it was it was awful for a really long time we wrote a law review article
we would put out op-eds and we would try and hustle up support and and compel her to look at these cases
seriously um so yeah it took a long time I can't remember the question but I'm just rambling but no
that's wonderful yeah um it must have been astonishing for you first of all to go into
a prison for the first time can you say something about what that was like the first time you went in
yeah um well I'll I'll move on to the first time I went to the women's prison in Oregon because that was
really amazing different so you know I'd gone I'd gone to the prison up in Washington Monroe prison
that's now closed where I met my first client and it's a very kind of very prison-y prison um you know
old school but but I went to Coffee Creek which is the women's prison in Oregon and the first time I
went we uh I went to meet a bunch of lifers when I was a law student and I know you know you don't
really know what to expect and anyway we sat in a little circle and we talked about criminal justice
issues with them and their lives and I was just dumbfounded because I was sitting next to one of
the most intelligent lovely women I'd met in ages and I couldn't get my head around the idea that she
was in prison um and so that was really confusing and just didn't make any sense to me and and also I
always said that the women's prison is like the saddest community center in the world because they
have like a lot of a lot of all the women are separated from their children and there's so much
grief and depression that just permeates the whole place so it's kind of a painful environment um to be
in like you into the visiting room they have a little children's area and it's just really sad and and
the grief is for the women is spent you know particularly it's just the women are so sad and depressed
and most of them of course there are women who do terrible things but a lot of the women in prison
they're generally speaking because of meth addiction and identity theft and a lot of the time because of
the way the sentences are operated in Oregon if they don't have a family member or someone to take
their children their children will often be adopted away from them even when they don't have long
sentences so there's just just a lot of pain it's really the number one atmosphere but most of all
i just remember just meeting people who were really like people who were in prison but there
but for the god i mean it could be me it could be you it's just the way their lives have unfolded um
and and and also i guess i'm not going back to the first time the first time was just an eye-opener
because everyone it wasn't the idea that we have about how prisoners are going to be just isn't true
prisoners are just other people who happen to have been convicted of crimes and are now living
having to live with uh the consequences of their poor choices in the most painful way you know
you you said something a little earlier that i'd just like to circle back to briefly
um you used the phrase a debt to society what did you mean by that well um in i guess in new in new
york i had had a business and i felt like i did you know i lost the business in the crash
um i had a catering business which i run with henrietta space and i felt like a real failure i felt like
you know like everyone would go well it was the economic crash and that's true to some degree but
i felt like i had really failed and let people down and i felt you know when you lose a business
like people quite casual about what it takes out of you you know it's just the the the loss of all
of that i felt like you know i just didn't i felt a lot of shame really i felt a lot of shame and
you know i left new york very penniless with my two boys
um and we you know we had literally taken the greyhound out to portland and i was i'd gone from
having this business which was somewhat of a good business and then suddenly being right at the bottom
of society a single mother on food stamps at community college and i you know i i i'd given up
alcohol i felt like i'd always drunk too much my mother had died i just i felt i just felt a lot of like
i i felt like i had not lived my best life i felt like i had i i felt like i owed i felt ashamed of
the loss of the business and i wanted to make i felt i at the beginning i volunteered for like the
red cross and did stuff like that because i felt i just felt that i don't you know like i just felt
like i hadn't lived the way i should have and so that kind of um that really motivated me for a
number of years you know yeah i can understand i can understand what you've said even from my own
personal experience i also lost a business at one point and i still feel confused about it yeah i it is
it's it it's like you put everything into it but it but it's also like i made bad i know i made mistakes i
i wasn't good at it you know like i would never have a business again i was i was bad at it i never
really understood the connection but i always thought if you just do a good job you'll make
profit but that's not how it works and i was very naive you know i just anyway so i and i felt like i
hadn't been the greatest mother because i'd worked all the time so i had a lot of guilt about my children
and just i had a lot of guilt and shame that was pushing me forward you know i see so maybe a debt
to society isn't actually the right phrase yeah maybe it's just i felt a debt yes some kind that
i felt like i needed to turn things around in a deep way for myself yeah that makes sense i understand
how did you become interested in the system that punishes criminals and what were some of the
motivating feelings that you had that drew you in that direction well i suppose like you from my
childhood i've always had a sort of grim fascination and horror of prison i always used to have recurring
nightmares of being in prison when i was a child and the idea of you know like all people having
autonomy over my life is incredibly important and so the loss of autonomy is really chilling and and
frightening i think i was very not i before i came to america i thought i had a very kind of
naive simplistic understanding of this country that came from watching you know spielberg movies and so
i you know i thought america was this just perfect country and then i was i remember just being
dumbfounded when i heard that there was a death penalty here it didn't make any sense to me and so i
guess i've always been interested in the dark side of america that i didn't understand before i came here
and then you know i spent a lot of time in the south in the 90s and i was living in new york in
the 90s i remember i was part of you know the war on crime and the you know the mass incarceration
that's happened in this country and how destructive it's been in my opinion um and the opinion of a lot
of sensible people so i think all of those reasons and then just um all of those reasons you know just
a sheer horror of it really and also i guess fascination say more about that
i've learned more about human nature doing this job and human behavior and human frailty i've learned
more about myself i've learned more about i've learned so much about the world through working
in prisons and with prisoners for the last seven years it's completely um it's fascinating work
you know i mean it's a you know i get to i've get to understand how we operate as humans in a way that
i never understood before so i guess i'm i'm it's sort of i question my motive sometimes you know am i
what am i doing this for i'm so interested and but then also i'm so connected to the pain of people's
stories now i know the story i know the story they're going to tell you know it's it's a similar
story for everyone the the happy middle class people with loving parents are not in prison
you know i mean very rarely yeah it sounds like your work has been both very challenging but also
deeply enriching yeah it's very painful at times um you can't help everyone it's really hard to come
to terms with that you know there are some people who are not going to get out and there's nothing you
can do about that you know we don't have any power to really we only have the power to try and persuade
people with power um and so that's frustrating and and painful um the system is against our clients
they've committed crimes most of them serious crimes they've caused incredible damage they've
done things that i don't know how i you know it is it's confusing in some ways you know um but also
yeah it's may it's by far and away the best thing i've ever done i mean i wouldn't you know i've had it
and i've had an interesting life but this is uh yeah this is just just feel like do you ever read
that book of human bondage by w somerset morne it's an english novel you i know the i know that
the title and the author and i've probably read parts of it but it was a long long time ago what
brings it to mind for you and and say something about it well it's it's just it's a it's a really
wonderful novel it's sort of it's supposedly a semi-autobiographical novel of somerset morne's
life in the kind of end of the 19th century um in england and just how hard life was then
for everyone and he at one point he is training to be a doctor in london and he just describes
you know because you're just seeing so much pain and suffering but he just
felt like it was life like he was so all its colors all its shapes and i feel that in prison
in a way like i'm seeing how people respond to this awful situation that they've generally put
themselves into and i'm just i'm seeing people behave in what in just an extraordinary kind of
different ways how they cope how they don't cope how they survive how they gather strength how they
transform themselves it's it's just the whole it's just so human you know so yeah that's that's what i mean
i think yeah and i so i think that book really captures it well in a far better way than i ever
could so that's why i thought about it what is something you've learned about prison that you
think ordinary people just don't have any idea about or don't know no that's a big question um
what do you want ordinary people to know it's another way well i i think i think it's not i mean
prison you know obviously prison is designed to be dehumanizing it's a way to kind of bring people
down and control them but i think ordinary people in america especially are very conditioned to just
have absolute harsh uh harsh feelings towards people who've been convicted of crimes and to
believe that they deserve everything that's coming their way but i think so there's i think people
should probably recognize everyone's humanity um a little bit better um but i think probably i'd say
american prison is really stupid and people should realize how stupid is because everyone here just
accepts these incredibly long sentences that we hand out unlike anywhere else in the world pretty much
how pointless it is and i'll tell you like i you know i've read i guess i've you know i can't remember
specifically but i read foucault and some stuff like that when i was in undergrad just the utter
pointlessness of it all i mean basically you we're just putting these people in these prisons
most of them are going to get out and yet we just sit there we put them in this brutal
this brutal environment doesn't teach them anything positive doesn't help anyone the only people who
transform themselves in prison are people who go out of their way to try and do so it's really
difficult most of the time you're just caught in this world of negativity and you're just treading
water and there's nothing positive happening it's stupid if we're going to put people in prison and we
want them to come back into society then we should be setting them up to succeed and overcome their
failings which we don't do we have a very punitive approach then we expect people to re-enter society
and to not commit more crimes and to just make a success it's incredibly hard to re-enter american
society from a technological point of view alone if you've been in prison for more than five years
i mean how do you even re-enter the world is there's no preparation for that it's really stupid
you know and then and it we also oh gosh i'm just trying to think of all i mean it's such a
so i think our prisons are stupid and cruel for no good reason and then because we're punishing all
these people for decades on at a time they you if you go to prison at 20 and you come out at 40
you're so how are you going to make a success you know if you want to put someone in prison for 20 years
it should be something really really really really serious a lot of the time it'll be just consecutive
sentences for something maybe minor so it's just not sensible what we're doing it's just so
non-constructive um and so people come out and they're not going to succeed and and then in
addition to that it's like the massive amount of money that's being poured into prisons for people
to die in prison the medical costs it doesn't make any sense but you can't talk about it or have
rational conversations in america because that you're accused of being soft on crime but not thinking
about like what's good for the society as a whole i mean we just made a conclusion hundreds of years
ago that if you do something bad then punishment is the consequence why that's not enough that's
not a natural consequence we've just made that decision why aren't for instance people making
amends be a far better use of their time it would be more in keeping if you come from a christian
background the idea of redemption surely we should be giving people a chance to redeem themselves in some
way to to make good to the best of their ability and we don't do that you know we just warehouse them
and by the way not just them all the poor men and women who work in prisons i mean they're also stuck
in prison in this and it's futile they're just moving people around in a warehouse all day long
for no reason so i think i think it's stupid the way we do it you know
um i hope you wouldn't mind if i opine a bit on on myself uh because it's it's plagued me since
childhood um so in in my in my heart right in in my um emotional self the idea that people are put in
cages uh just seems fundamentally wrong so if if there's some kind of an egregious wrong that someone
uh participates in right and then we go to extreme lengths to quote punish this person who was
participating in it then we all become complicit in their torture and it's really hard for me to
understand that anyone could not understand that torturing humans is fundamentally ethically wrong
there's no possibility of justifying something like that under any circumstances whatsoever right
and there's all these arguments oh go ahead no no i'm listening carry on there's all these arguments
that um i think that are fundamentally wrong and stupid as you've said and one of them is that crime
is a banking system right yeah if you do wrong then you have to quote pay for the wrong but let's
be clear there's no way to pay there's no kind of paying that undoes the wrong and certainly
punishment being punished has nothing to do with undoing the wrong whatsoever nothing no and no it's
such a terrible racket really because you know these poor people who've suffered you know they're
victims of a crime or someone they love has been killed and you know they kind of sold this concept of
justice um by prosecutors by the system you know we're going to get justice for you there's no
justice how can there be justice someone is gone something cannot be undone it is horrific tragedy
there is no justice and so but they're told that they're going to get justice we're going to put him
in prison we're going to execute him we're going to put him in prison for 30 years i want justice and
there is no there can't be this it's just this whole concept is ridiculous and it doesn't help
victims i don't think either it continues to make them suffer actually you know it continues to make
them suffer because um they can't having that person put in prison or having that person be punished or
having that person suffer it doesn't help them heal in any way if anything it it keeps them
angry which is the worst place to be you know yes we are it's part of our um it's part of our uh
socialization in the united states and what i call inculturization right it actually has something
to do with language too because at least in the united states and i think this is true in many western
countries but to a different degree um we are actually inculcated right we are uh we are scripted
by the culture to believe
that
to think about situations relationships and culture as if they are courtrooms
we are inculcated with the sort of courtroom consciousness and it starts in childhood you can
see your peers and other children start to think about what would happen if we had to go to court or or
play acting out a courtroom drama or a court scene or something like this and you can see that the
children are being scripted by the culture they're being um molded into a mindset that is absolutely
without anything resembling justification um and is horrific uh if if we become complicit which we do by
paying taxes and supporting the system and failing to establish a better system and so forth in the
torture of other beings then that's a catastrophic moral failing for us um and those of us who live in
this culture and have any degree of awareness about this matter we feel a terrible burden and the people
who work in the prisons are dehumanized and feel a terrible burden too and it's a very depressing thing to
do and it's a weird sort of compressed it's basically like inventing a kind of hell on earth
and then just funding the hell out of it right just pouring money into it and making it into a business
and so forth this kind of thing must come to an end somehow this is completely wrong yeah i mean i'm
so i agree with you it's just that it's the whole everything we're doing is is i you know i don't really
have a better word other than just stupid and callous and thoughtless and just everyone just
closes their eyes to it and bitches about oh well they're getting free food and you know and sort
of free health care and all this kind of the only they knew but you know it yeah no i mean i'm losing
my tracks i'm like yes i agree with you it's just maddening really um and i was going to say something
but it's gone it was going to be brilliant as well so i can't remember we'll just keep circling around
so there's a few more things that i really need to say yeah i know that um there are many people
who've written brilliantly about this problem i am specifically aware of some things derek jensen
has written about this um he's an activist a brilliant american activist and ecologist author
and he's written extensively about this topic i'm mentioning his name so that people who are
listening could could tune in um are there any is are there any people that you have uh read who
particularly impressed you with their perspectives i have barely stopped barely read anything since i
became a lawyer it's i was a really great reader my whole life and now i'm a lawyer i can barely read
anything um so i'm trying to think what i've read i mean i just i'm so immersed in in all the reading i
do i'm like really embarrassed now so no i don't i can't think of anyone who's read anything i read some
um trying to remember the i read a couple of books about the philosophy of punishment recently because
i've been thinking a lot about like which is what made me you know even just contemplate like why
why is everyone so comfortable with punishment as a concept you know i mean it's been like that
forever but why there's not that's not a necessary that's not a necessary it doesn't help anything
right i mean i do i do recognize having worked with a lot of prisoners now in different ways that
there are some there are different kinds of people in prison so you know when i first started um i was
only working with people who were in prison for a very very long time who were kind of incredible people
you know i was sort of working with people who had really just done these incredible transformative
things in prison and and were very deep thinkers and truly amazing people so i think at the beginning
i was a little too romantic about prison and just you know everyone there and i just thought i was you
know just seemed as i've as i've worked with more people i am aware that first of all there are some
people who shouldn't be in society because they're going to cause a lot of damage um not many but
there's a few people and um then there are plenty of people who have got caught into a negative way
of understanding their life in the world and so they need to have help kind of change their way of
thinking in order for them to succeed in society um but there's a but as i said there's only a very
few people who i feel need to be kept away from everyone else most people would benefit from most
people who've committed crimes in my experience are fairly broken by what they've done especially
serious crimes and they have a desperate desire to serve to make amends to repent if you will and
they're not given those up it's hard for them to do that and then there's a few people who are
problemat that they're just they're just you know very few people they win they need to be you know
they need there needs to be some protection for society for individuals and then most other people
are just really if they had been socialized better if they hadn't grown up in the foster care system
if they'd had people who loved them who nurtured them who who taught them how to live in the world they
will be fine you know and so it there is i'm not talking philosophically at all but i'm just speaking
quite pragmatic practically there's no reason there's no need for this the way we're doing it
there's no need for it at all not any part of it you know and we've but how to change that in this
country in america that's a very difficult question because people are really as you said they're
socialized to believe in this without question even my like super liberal friends uh who think
of themselves as you know super liberal they'll be like finisher i think it's great what you're doing
um you know i'd love to help him in in some way my husband has a catering business and and he could
he would be happy to hire some people when they come out of prison and i'd be like oh that's great oh
but we can't have anyone who committed a violent crime or a felony and we only want people who did this
and i'm like go away you know go away if you you know i mean i blame hollywood as well no no i agree
um it's as if there are uh well i mean this gets into some complex ground here but but maybe we'll
cover it maybe we'll walk through this little field briefly together um you know in america i think we're
too quick to use this word we you know we don't do this we think this the people the blah blah blah
but actually mostly what we have here is the absence of the we and it's the absence of a we
that presents as a we but there's it's there's actually nothing inside it it's like dead inside
and it's stupid inside and it's filled with processes that ride on humans and what we call
the criminal justice system is exactly that kind of process it's a dead inside thing like a cancer
or a vampire or something right and it just rides on generation after generation after generation
and it sucks up resources and it makes agony and it has nothing to do with justice what it has to do
with is preserving the dead monster of that system and how it rides on our culture and i think it's
really important for people to understand that we're surrounded by monsters like this
political systems our judicial systems the military industrial prison complex these are effectively
demons they are the absence of of humans pretending to act in the interest of humans that are powerless
uneducated and completely um sort of hypnotized by the narratives that we're subjected to from childhood
in through each phase of our life right and it's as if half of our interiority is some kind of a zombie
that just goes around thinking like well of course you have to well punish those people well well what
are you going to do instead i mean there's a really simple answer to what to do instead like
if somebody's smashing their head against a wall over and over again and it's just causing more pain
and blood the first thing you do is you just stop smashing your head against them you just stop doing
something that's that stupid right and then you can say well people have to be taken out of society you
know whatever yes of course but there's some kind of humane way to do that that doesn't make us
complicit in in torturing not just the people themselves but their families their their their
lineage their their history of their family um the people who have to torture them you know the whole
sort of mangled up mess of this problem so that's one thing i want to make really clear is just like
there's no we i don't know what we means it doesn't mean we didn't we never formed an
intelligent collective to deal with any of these problems so the way that they get mostly dealt with
and i'm sorry if i'm lecturing here a bit or no no i mean i i agree with you on the we i'm always i'm
always i have an internal shudder when i hear you know we don't do that here or we don't always feel
like a rebellion in my soul when i hear that language what what we i'll do what i want you know yeah
the absence of a we being presented as a we it's like a victim we know but it's it's very oppressive
it's like controlling this is what we think good or one of my other things that makes me shudder is
when they say you know good folk you know so anything to do with the word folk always scares me
um as a oh my god you wouldn't believe that's so funny that you say that please continue
no no no why um maybe i can show you something because it's very ironic that you said this
um can you hang on for just a second yeah of course okay i'll be right back
so these are two paintings that are hanging in my hallway
okay okay oh yeah good oh that's brilliant right
okay those were made by the son of the man who invented the super soaker sport gun believe it or not
okay um all right so that was a little bit of a sidetrack um you know it's really weird
what we call society isn't one or or rather there's a there's a few threads of something resembling a
society that managed to survive inside the mostly malignant you know situation and um these are
things that i study right i'm fascinated by these things in the same way that i'm fascinated by the
problem of prisons i never believed that punishment was the right idea at all um and i want to say a
little bit about uh something because we were talking earlier about justice yeah and it's true
that we can't uh if somebody's been injured or killed or something right it's pretty tough to uh
if they've been injured there might be some some way of partial remediation or something like this
but torturing the person that injured them is not the right thing to do um and making us complicit in
that is just i can't even understand like what kind of a mind what sort of primitive barbaric you know
medieval dungeoneering consciousness thought this up and and was able to to make it happen right in a way
that has lasted and continues to last it's just it staggers the mind um but it occurs to me that the
people that we call criminals they are like people who've been infected with something and if we wanted
to resolve the something that infected them in our culture in our society not only would we not punish
the criminals we would use them to forensically trace back the poison in our society that produced
their behavior and we would understand that these are like children who've been subjected to a poisonous
substance and then produce symptoms right and so we would forensically trace the symptoms back to their
origins and resolve them there and that's what what people would actually want they might you know
they might be really angry that their husband or wife or child was killed or something like this
perhaps justifiably angry but what they would want there's no way to punish there's no way to
bring them joy by tormenting the person that did this what would bring them joy is if we resolved
the problems in our culture that keep producing this behavior in people well now you sound like one of us
i mean this is literally how we feel on a daily basis is like so when a crime is committed the
way the statutes are written it's like was the gun lifted did they shoot it okay guilty we don't need
to look at the person we don't need to look at the individual and our sentencing in this country
is like that's the crime that's the punishment now piss off right what you'll be doing clemency is we
bring it all out and we want to look at the person we want to look at their whole life story
and we want to tell the story of what how they got to the day when this happened and who they them
it's like kind of like aa this is who i was this is what happened and this is who i am now and the
minute you look at someone's story and you and you see their humanity well then you kind of want don't
want them to be in prison and that's how the clemency happens that's where the governor understands
and sees the person in their in their humanity how this happened why it happened you know and and right
i mean i start one of the first things i read was a really good book by a lawyer called david doe
dow he's a death penalty lawyer in texas and it was a series of essays about everything he had learned
as a death penalty lawyer and he he gave this staggering um staggering statistic to me that i
feel sums it all up something like at the time i think it was 81 of the men on death row in texas
grew up in the foster care system okay so and i did a death penalty cost study in oregon and i saw that
at least 50 of the crimes involved methamphetamine one way or another so the idea that these are the
bad people who need to be punished forever is just foul really because we're talking about people who have
i mean the foster care system is brutal i can tell you stories all day long about the suffering that
my clients have gone through as children it is sickening what they've gone through and and yeah
they cause damage at some point for sure but the idea that these people are bad and need to be punished
forever is so inhumane because actually as i've noticed from working with my clients is
a few crumbs of kindness and someone will blossom a little bit of love a little bit of being i mean
i don't like to use this language but like when like i would write people's stories and they would
be so moved that someone had listened to them and told their story and like and and they felt like
that even if i didn't get them out it was enough that their story had been told actually they wanted
to get out too but um and so yes you're absolutely right like this we need to be looking at people
as individuals and stop with just focusing on the crime if we want to make the if we want to change
things for the better we should be recognizing our own culpability in how these crimes happen because
these crimes don't happen you know contrary to how hollywood likes to present people who've committed
crimes as these kind of killing machines who will kill it and every opportunity like most people just
there's always tragedy behind the story not always but virtually always you know and and people are
capable of an enormous transformation if given even a little bit of a chance and we're not giving
people the chance no we're doing the opposite yeah we are we're sticking a thumb on them and going you're
nothing you're nothing you're nothing and we're going to degrade you at every single day every
single moment and then which actually just reiterates the injustice of their childhood in their adult
life yeah and how are they going to believe in anything yeah this is exactly what this is torture
yeah and there's no i mean the idea that um there's something in our constitution about uh
uh absurd punishments right like i can't remember yeah actual phrase right but yeah cruel and unusual
yeah yes that's it cruel and unusual i mean what could be more cruel and unusual than torturing humans
in a cage like you'd have to really do something you know it really depends on how you understand the
word unusual so i fight myself because i think about this so people you know you'll look at a concert
you'll look at a supreme court and they'll go well it's not unusual because we've been putting people in
cages forever and i would say but think of unusual as meaning peculiar or wrong right that's how i
understand the word unusual it's more of a it was a very unusual punishment meaning not that it's
uncommon which is how it's interpreted right that's very off yeah like inhuman yeah yeah and it's really
weird because um the uh the systems that are our society the sort of um organs of our society they're
not human no no and they're not they don't have emotions they're not intelligent they're not civilized
all of these things that we say and we think about uh our sort of advanced progress are mostly just
bullshit um they're just like towering monolithic lies that keep lumbering forward you know under the
under the impetus of the the money that we and the and the violence that we pour into them right so
it occurs to me that um okay look if i mean you're probably aware of what happened in i think the
50s or 60s with the introduction of lead into gasoline okay tell me the story okay so there was a there's
a giant there was a radical increase in violent crime over a specific epoch of the history of the united
states and it was eventually realized that um the fumes from the gasoline right were destroying
people's brain their nervous systems literally right and so you know this is i think a serious problem
we're attacking individuals for the outcomes of the failure of our culture to produce anything that's
humane or intelligent or civilized or communal right and so if we're going to punish something
if somebody needs to go to jail our culture should be good in jail right it's just producing the poison
that's torturing children and mothers and fathers and completely failing to support them in any
nourishing or nurturing way right i mean i think yeah no i mean i was just going to say i just think
american society is like you say it doesn't exist anymore or you know i remember you know reading a
lot about what what a rich society this country had you know um a long time ago where there was such
strong communities and everyone was involved and there was community organizations whether it was
church or bowling community groups or golf or whatever like america was kind of i'm thinking of
that alexis de tocqueville book i think it's called america which he wrote you know just what this
country was and that country doesn't exist anymore you know we've got just atomization and there's no
nothing there's no community i mean community is something you have to really create for yourself
if you've got the wherewithal to realize that's what you need um but most people they're so
desperately lonely and isolated and under socialized and it's getting worse and worse so we don't have
humanity for each other as a consequence you know we don't have policing even that's community policing
anymore where everyone's invested in the success of the community and remember when i was young you
know if if someone did something wrong let's say my brother um then i remember just a story of my
brother doing some damage to the local farm so the farmer showed up at the house and told my brother off
and he learned a lesson and he wouldn't do that again that kind of community's gone now people call the
police the system comes in and the system takes over and once you're in the system god help you
because they i think even god's gonna have a rough time good point you're done for life the
the minute you're in the system the minute you've got a conviction they own you one way or another and
i mean this this leads into the problem of the slavery aspect of prisons and prison hearing like this
is a phrase that's very important to me because i think that many features of our culture that present
as enabling or progress or something like this are actually just prison hearing you know facebook is
really kind of a prison hearing paradigm yes you can you can have connections there that are real and
you can make real connections but mostly what gets celebrated is the worst common denominator and what gets
sidelined is anything that's actually intelligent or humane or community building or or radical or
revolutionary or anything like that but um you know i think there's another feature of this issue which is
that as our as our lives have been sort of fracked by american culture and the state and the banking system
and the sort of the job system which is another really kind of a form of slavery um the financial
system as our lives have been fracked and and crucial resources have been extracted from us to be
so that we can be sold back the wrapping paper on on the candy bar right again and again we're being sold
back the image of something that was that was stolen or snuffed right um then what that does is it builds
a a a feeling that somebody has been ruining my life right somebody has been ruining my life and it must be
those immigrants it must be those criminals right and so there's this there's this scripting to scapegoat
um when actually again the the perpetrator is really these dead lumbering monolithic systems that we serve
without i mean how do you punish something that has no body right how do you how do you get justice from
something that's um absolutely fundamental to the it's it's like it's like the infrastructure of the
environment itself that we live in right how do you call that out how do you change it how do you
how do we organize to make some kind of a shift and one of the things i think is amazing about your work
is that in a way you found a crack i i'll tell you what it's actually demoralizing to be honest with you
because it was really exciting when we had a governor who was willing to do this and i personally
got to have some incredible experiences but it was like getting struck by lightning the truth is is that
for the people who got out or it was like a miracle a golden ticket willy wonka it isn't real okay like
i am so delighted for each of my clients that they get to be free and they get a second chance at their
lives but they are like the governor can feel oh so good about herself and pat herself on the back for
her amazing humanity okay but it's a trifle it's a trifle and it's really meaningless in reality because i
mean not for those individuals but like nothing has changed if anything we're worse off now because
governor brown let out 100 people over the course of eight years who for rehabilitation or roughly that
because of that now a massive pendulum swing against any kind of mercy in oregon is happening
and now no one will get out for another generation because of these few 30 people and like everyone will
be like so it you know like in the end i'm like it's kind of like for me yeah you're right i got
the wrapping paper but i didn't get the candy it's just like i didn't help i haven't really changed
anything or helped anyone in any in any meaningful way the system is if anything just a little bit
nastier than it was before all the clemency happened and it's only getting nastier because that's the way
it's more it's safer that way to be meaner and to be more cruel than the politicians can be puffing
themselves as being tough on crime to the american people who are who have bought into all this crap
um you know we talk about freedom in this country i don't know what we're talking about what kind of
freedom we're talking about you know the freedom to be stupid and opinionated i guess yeah the freedom
to believe you're a victim when you you know the the freedom to to see the world i mean people aren't
happy in this country i don't see this as a happy country when i first came to this country or what
i understood america to be before i came to this country doesn't exist i mean i've never met such
a group of people who are as unhappy as americans who live in a land of plenty in many ways you should
there should be a land of abundance and joy and it isn't you know it's really it's weirdly a kind of a
land of like well i mean look there's a lot of different things going on but one of the things
that you're pointing out is true which is that over the past say 40 years the um the entrenched systems
that thrive on american money labor and opinion have ratcheted down and they're just they're just
ratcheting almost exponentially with each you know passing year and obviously this is in a context of
rising scarcity rising environmental toxicity rising social and relational toxicity and rising militarism
in you know the what we call the developed nation i mean i don't know what they developed a disease
and what does developed mean they have buildings um yes i think so yeah i think that's what it means
they have buildings right yeah yeah so you know um these systems are driven really by processes that
are dead inside it literally is like demons i won't keep ringing that bell but it might as well be because
they do the same thing yeah no it's just i always think of this as unwieldy machine kind of going forward
yeah just eating up lives yeah eating up lives and bodies yeah yeah and environments it's like a
meat grinder but what does it grind out machines technology i don't even quite understand what it
what it produces it's all about control i guess well it produces little um new it sort of metastasizes
like a cancer right and then it builds a new form and then metastasizes that and it just keeps
kind of doing these things just keep doing this and the humans it's it's it's ironic to me that
they're angry at for example immigrants or you know people who they think are soft on crime or something
like this because the actual perpetrators that are destroying their lives are completely invisible
to them they have no idea if you wanted if you if we wanted to actually make our society a healthy society
we could do that yes i mean it would it would probably be less work than keeping this going i mean
if we really cared about you know the plight of children let's say and growing and developing them
into happy humans we would change everything and the way we do everything but we're not serious about
anything i you know america i was told this in my first week of community college and you know if
there's an open wound then we'll put a band-aid on it and look in the other direction you know that's
kind of how we operate with our laws and politics and everything you know we're not trying to act
there's no there's no genuine desire to make america work better i mean you know they'll be like oh look
i've got this i passed this law and now this tiny subset of people are going to get this slight
advantage for about five minutes you know exactly you know let's pour you know nine kinds of gasoline on
six other fires yeah exactly and then like you know oh there's a fire so we're going to need to
tax you for this you know whatever so it just you know it's always very frustrating and i suppose
if i talk to anyone in any kind of area where they know they're going to feel the same way where
you know i dare say you could have a similar conversation with people who work in the
healthcare field and they're going to talk to you about how inhumane it all is and how stupid it all
is and how it could be it could be this place where we actually care about the health of americans
and want people to live healthy lives but that's not the healthcare system or anything
but certainly in the criminal justice system you know if you talk to anyone who's paying attention
any defense attorney who cares they're going to say we need this we need that we need we need we got
to get rid of the foster care system we have to rework it we have to come up with a better way of
of looking we have to stop we have to deal with why why are people using drugs why why why are people
needing to seek oblivion what's wrong exactly yeah this is what i meant you know by using the analogy of the
lead in the gasoline because yeah we did eventually realize oh that's poisonous so apparently they
stopped putting lead in gasoline right and violent crime went down um i think if i remember correctly
about this now but what we have now are like i don't know 12 000 different kinds of toxicity in the
environment that's completely unregulated and it's damaging people's you know bodies and their minds and
and then the the abject failure of any kind of real communal basis for our humanity i mean the
thing that humans most need is a meaningful role right they need meaningful roles and this i think is
part of what motivated you is that you wanted to live in a way that you you felt that the role that
you were um enacting was true to your spirit and your heart right and i think it's amazing that you've done
that even though i understand why you say it's depressing and demoralizing well i mean let me
just be clear like i would like i i got it was that you ever watched that film moneyball or whatever
it's a film where they they find this kind of like this little opening and and so there was a little
opening that we got through and we got a bunch of people out through that opening and that door has
slammed now and it's probably going to be slammed well beyond the scope of my career you know um or you know
maybe maybe it'll open up again i don't know it depends but the whole thing was based on the
discretion of one person and so that's crazy yeah you know and so now i'm back to the courts and the
judges and working in the system that way and the law and you know it's stacked against it's just stacked
against people who've committed crimes or being convicted of crimes you know there's no room for
humanity there's no room for like the idea that maybe this person ha is is not it could return to
the community to their family could become a taxpayer like could benefit the whole that no no we have
we just know we set the sentences there's no discretion we doors slam come out in 15 years
we're not interested in anything else beyond that so it is hard you know it's a hard job because um
you know very few people and you know there are people that i know who shouldn't be in prison are
going to stay in prison and their lives and you know i have i have these two clients brothers um
who were wrongfully convicted in 1995 of murder um i was able to get one of the brothers out on
clemency i know they're innocent i know they're innocent it's not like i don't i don't feel it
like in some naive way i've got recanting affidavits i've got uh evidence of prosecutorial
misconduct i've got brady violations um i know that this this man should get out but i don't know
whether i'm going to be able to get him out because everything is against us and no one cares
no one cares no one cares and yet this man and his brother between them have lost 60 years of their
lives his children had to grow up without a father you know his parents had to take the grief the sat
tragedy just goes in every direction you know and i'm and i i'm sitting in like it's great that the
younger brother got out and i thank the governor for doing that but the older brother i'm scared for
him because his life there's no there's no he can't win even if he gets out they stole 30 years
of his life from him they can't come back from that yeah it's like um it's like a crime happens and then
the system wakes up and does its malignant nonsense and then we just pour like plutonium or radioactivity
right into the social and relational environment as if that's going to solve something i mean i guess
what it solves is money builds up in somebody's coffers and power builds up in somebody's coffers
power i'll tell you one group of people that no one could care less about in this country the
children of incarcerated people there is such a shocking lack of humanity for those children you
know like like no one cares about them and and how that's going to affect them and the loneliness and
the heartbreak that they go through you know and yeah it's extraordinary to me i've seen it and i've
seen it kind of manifest in a variety of ways just knowing no one that's not even a factor now it used to
be if you go back 100 years and i look at how the criminal justice system was operating at the
beginning of the 20th century before everything got so professionalized you would see governors
releasing a third of the prison community every year on clemency you would see them releasing people
because their family needed them or because their wife was sick or because they were needed to help at
the harvest like practical solutions like yes it's true they still had prisons but the prisons
weren't there to keep people hostage for the rest of their lives you know right they would release
people because it was for the bad they could they could balance the way the needs of everyone they
won't do that now i just want to highlight again that what i think the direction whether or not we can
go there is a separate question but the direction toward justice does not look like punishing perpetrators
it looks like education rehabilitation and the forensic examination of what produced the conditions
that led this person in this direction and resolving those in our culture that is an actual plan that
makes sense it's intelligent humane cost effective and will work right if we're going to keep doing this
other crap then what's going to happen is more and more violent crime and the industrialization
of the punishment of prisoners so that now it becomes like a business now it's a profitable thing to run
prisons i mean what do you think about the the um the sort of corporatization of for-profit prisons
well we don't have those in oregon so i haven't kind of experienced that um as i haven't been into a
for-profit prison i mean it's certainly a sickening concept but then i mean
you know we all our prisons are funded by the taxpayers
in oregon oh gosh if they knew where their money was going um i mean yeah i know it's it's extremely
unhealthy i mean you know i i was reading a book recently about um prisons down in louisiana and of
course you know they got rid of slavery what's that okay this is louisiana yeah they you know they
got they got rid of slavery and then they started incarcerating um the entire black population there
was something like 400 crimes a black person could go to prison for and 20 crimes a white person could
go to prison for and so that's how they then funded all the you know they got their slave labor
back that way right and on for a long time um they made it easier to convict people by getting
attend to you know not even non-unanimous stuff and so i mean in oregon all the prisoners are required
by law to work for the oregon corrections enterprises and they all earn about 50 a month
working full time for the state they if you call up the dmv in oregon it'll be a prisoner who
answers the phone um so i mean they're they're it's you know yeah it's slavery yeah it is absolutely
an indentured servitude or something anyway it's even in our constitution that it's allowed like it's
proudly so you know so yeah we're allowed to use prisoners as slaves that's constitutional
temporarily hopefully well i don't know so the whole yeah i mean basically you're right it's not
difficult if you if you're going to put somebody in prison and remove them from society and know that
they're going to come back to society at some point it would make common sense to make sure they're going
to come back and be successful right one i mean that's just obvious and how can that possibly
happen after 20 years in prison i mean you come out um with the shadow of the crime on your record
if you're a felon you have to tell everyone that you're a felon all of your social contacts are gone
your family may or may not still exist or talk to you or anything i mean what is the person going to
do there we've given them such a staggering array of disadvantages that the expectation that they're
going to become i mean this language sickens me anyway a productive member of society what is that
okay you're going to serve the lumbering monsters that you know started the problem in the first place
no it's and it's worse than that because of course most people well most of my clients have been in
prison 30 or 40 years so i've got people who went to prison in 1988 and they come out in 2024 can you
even begin to imagine that right yeah um i've you know and so now they they're handed a smartphone and
said yeah deal with this for all aspects of your life i mean we we had you know we've had to get used
to it year by year as the technology's improved so they went to prison when pages were barely invented
when vhs's which was all the new thing yeah we're listening to cassettes yeah exactly and like they
come out and they don't understand the world world and they don't feel comfortable they don't feel
alive i mean they're not even used to working properly because i mean try and think water for
40 years you know try and think about um
um try and think about the problem just of housing yeah when you went into prison you could earn enough
to house yourself you know pretty reasonably right who's going to be able to earn two thousand dollars
a month to house themselves when they come out of prison or you know 1500 that's a huge amount of
money what is their skill base they've got no connections they have a felony yeah maybe they've got
a skill in prison where you know some of them i mean there are some trades that you can learn but
then no one wants to hire you because you've been in prison for 30 years or something it's really
difficult it's really really difficult and it's it's also just emotionally so hard for them yeah it's
absolutely demoralizing yeah yeah and and and so a lot of you know i've seen i've seen how you know and
of course one of the big things that makes me crazy is you know you hear prosecutors yakking away
about community safety and about all of this stuff and i have seen my first the first client i got
out actually um he was um he'd been in for 18 years he'd been in since he was 18 and so i hear all this
talk in court about you know blah blah blah and we got this whole process and rehabilitation yada yada
so when they got him out um he was in jail we had a court hearing uh where they ruled that they had to
release him and they were meant to release him that evening and they didn't release him and the jail
didn't want to release him and so there's a huge you know drama and then they said they weren't going
to release him to the following morning and i could go pick him up at five in the morning
and i get a call at about one in the morning and it's from a number i didn't recognize and i answer
it and it's my client and they'd kicked him out of the jail at one in the morning with a plastic bag
of possessions no shoes a pair of pants for a man who's about 200 pounds heavier than him so he had
to hold his pants up and no money luckily i'd had him memorize my number and he met someone on a bridge
who gave him my number and i went to pick him up from a bridge at one in the morning now this kid
had he was in his late 30s he'd been in prison since he was 18 he didn't know any like that was
how they released him so don't tell me you care about the safety of the community because that's a
joke and i've had this i've had that happen twice where people literally just got kicked out of
prison without any kind of preparation or any housing arranged for them or anything and i've
had diabetic clients who get kicked out of prison with no medication and or people with mental uh
issues that are sent out without their medication i mean it's just a joke like at every point it's a
callous indifferent joke um and and it's not benefiting one person not not one regular american
has benefited from this but americans are unfortunately so conditioned to believe that
anyone who's convicted convicted of a crime is an irredeemable dangerous person who doesn't deserve
anything anymore that it doesn't you know that they're so conditioned to believe that that no change
is possible until people realize that's not true that's interesting because what you're suggesting is that
to be convicted of a crime is effectively in america a nominal death sentence i mean it's certainly a
civil death of sorts you know i mean you know you can't vote or participate in society properly there's
a lot of things that happen after a conviction but yes i would say so i'd say it's a life sentence
if not a death sentence you know i mean you know you all you'll always meet people who are like i'm
trying to get off papers i'm trying to get off papers they just want to not have to be
continuously owned because it's very easy to mess up when you're under that level of scrutiny i mean
i wouldn't want to be scrutinized nor would you nor would anyone because we're all criminals if you
if you open the federal code you know they can find a crime for anyone you know yes yes that's the other
thing the people who um are you know shaking their finger at the criminals how many how many untried crimes
are they guilty of yeah hundred thousand i mean we all are you know like there's a there's a sort
of a comedy skit where um you know the comedian gets up on stage and says so like how many of you
people copied a video or uh you know a song right and just give me a show of hands right everybody
raises their hands and then they're like okay the fbi agents that are there on the corners of the room
they'll be talking to you right now basically you know the whole audience gets arrested right yeah
it's true we have too many laws yeah i mean there's so many laws that it's it's probably
nearly impossible to not break some of them and there's also i mean there's a variety of problems
like you know violent crime is a different thing from uh monetary crime or theft or you know vandalism
or trespassing or something like this but um i think my point is that not only do the prisons not
help these people okay actually there's another point i want to make it before it gets lost
we treat criminals as if they're separate from us and i have to say for myself and i'm just
speaking for myself if there's one person in prison i feel like part of me is in prison
i don't feel separate i can think of myself as an individual and i can live my life as an individual
and that's what america tells us to be and if i start talking like this my conservative my conservative
friends would be like oh you mean you're a communist like no i'm not a communist i'm a human being
right um i don't think we're actually separate in the way that we imagine ourselves to be
we may think that we are we may be we've been trained to conceptualize the individual as a
separate being but when those people are in prison i feel like part of me is in prison and they're not
separate this is why i feel suffering when i know someone else is suffering i don't object to prisons
simply because it's wrong to torture humans i object to prisons because i feel tortured by their existence
i feel tormented by that yeah i i understand what you're saying it's like if we if we're all humans
together then which we are you know then you you to turn your to turn yourself away from the plight of
all these other people is inhumane of you to some degree you know you're disconnecting yourself from your
humanity to be able to do that you know i mean it's much worse than it's much worse than that
because i have to fund it yeah right so it's not just i'm turning my head away you know i'm i'm giving
dollars to make sure that gets continued you know it's so painful like when i first started doing this
back in you know i guess i was going into the prisons in 2017 i was in the prisons maybe three or
four days a week i was there all the time and it's so hard so like i would be so mentally exhausted so
emotionally fraught from it and now i can barely go into prison anymore like i have to force myself to go
um i it is it just is so soul crushing and then you leave your clients there and you know they're so
so it's just not a way you know it's so awful what it does to people to make them so powerless
to just strip their autonomy in such a an extreme way it is it's harder and harder for
me to be able to face going into prison you know because it just it's just terrible for everyone for
everyone involved yeah no yeah but at the same time other parts of me from doing this work have also
made me quest like what can be done you know these you know i meet people i've listened in hearings
where uh the families of people who were murdered talk and the pain and agony and just that the way
the world is never good again for them after something so terrible has happened and there's
different kinds of victims you know i've met some people who were just you know they they won't they're
here to they don't ever this person has to die in prison because their their family member died and and
i don't even know who am i to judge that emotion you know that that you know that's that's for them
very important that it is a betrayal of their family member if this person ever gets out of prison
because they don't get to be free again and that's how they think and then there are other people
who've you know dug deep within their souls and they've known that forgiveness is the only path for
them and it's the hardest thing for them to do even knowing that because the pain of their loss of the
life that didn't get to happen the way it should have of that you know whether it's a son or a brother
or a daughter child knowing knowing that they didn't get to love to live to have for family to
grow old to have all of those privileges taken away from them but they force themselves to forgive
because they know it's the only pathway to their healing you know and i've heard other victims who
were like broken but you know it's so painful knowing their pain and what they've all been told is that
prison is a solution and it isn't for them they know you know it it it it's just the it's just so
crushing to listen to them it has you know it takes a lot out of you to hear that kind of raw pain and
and so i have i i'm i'm still confused about how i feel about it all you know sometimes i'm like
maybe you know i remember talking to a prosecutor when i started and he just said there are some crimes
from which i do not think a person can come back and that's what i that's why i believe in the
death sentence now i mean the death sentence is a vile thing but i believe that that was a genuine
belief you know i'm so glad you mentioned these things and it's interesting because um
one of the beautiful i mean there's so many beautiful things that are happening right now but
in our in our talk that i'm i'm just so joyful that that that others will get to hear and and
understand um some of your perspectives and feelings and concerns and and your work history and stuff
and why you're committed to this um but there's another problem that i want to very to be very clear
about which is this idea and it's it's a poisonous idea it's a lethal cancerous idea and it's the idea that
your that one's personal identity is a permanent thing so that if i steal a candy bar when i'm five
i'm a thief for the rest of my life yeah i know that label has to stick forever and it seems we don't
we don't understand like not we the systems the malignant systems that do these things that that sort of
perpetuate this nightmare um they treat individual identity as if it can sustain a mark
for eternity right so that if joe uh say was drunk and killed someone when he was 17 you know he's a
murderer for the rest of his life or whatever and the actual fact is that i am not the same person that i
was when i was younger i am a different person now and if if there's to be anything resembling justice
then we have to undo this uh i'm gonna i'm gonna slap a label on you and that label will stay there
forever right because the person who commits a crime is not the same person necessarily one year later
two years later three years later this is what it means to be human it doesn't mean you know i once
kicked a dog so i'm a dog kicker from now on that's what i do yeah no it is so true and it was you
know it's something i've come up against a lot especially uh when doing clemency and i would
be working with people who had committed crimes when they were teenagers you know they'd killed
someone and when they were seven six fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen and now they're in their late
forties say and i would i would tell the story and you know you with every single juvenile crime
that i've ever worked with there's a million reasons as to why this crime happened that involve
things outside of that you know it's just this just a child you know yeah and so you know and
and then they've gone to prison and they've gone and just led this incredible life and they've you know
done hospice and they've healed people and they've written books and they've created programs for the
betterments of others they've mentored people they've lived a life where they love and give and serve
and believe that they have an unpayable debt to society that they wake up every morning and try
and pay and and that it's these incredible human beings that i've met and so i'll write these stories
and just be so i'm gonna cry reading my own petitions because their stories were so incredible and the
strength of character they've displayed is so monumental knowing the darkness of their lives at 18 being
told you will never get out of prison you you will never be released and yet they created these
amazing lives in prison of service and i get to the you know i get to the da and i have to send a
copy of the petition to the da and then the district attorney the district attorney then he has to weigh
in on his position to the governor about whether he will oppose clemency and of course prosecutors
are in the game of putting people in prison so clemency is somewhat they see it somewhat as
undermining undermining the work that they've done right they will look at this and they will say no
this person is irredeemable this person must never get out of prison this person is a danger to society
he is an evil killer and they will deny all evidence of the 30 years and whilst in the next breath talking
about how they believe in juvenile you know rehabilitation and all of this stuff like they it's like a
disconnect you know they're labeled criminal at 18 or labeled murderer at 15 and no one can see past that
and they or they refuse to or they deny it you know luckily our governor could um and so quite a few of
these young men and women got out who were in that window although in that tiny window that we had right
this is the thing that came out that i think it's very important that's come out in this one of the
things that's come out in the conversation is that you were able to succeed for a very short window
yeah it went from despair to a short window of success to despair yeah it was really interesting
what happened because it was all political um so i the governor she came into office in 2015 we heard
we knew that she had been a juvenile rights lawyer earlier in her career so of a few petitions were given
to her for you for youthful offenders we felt not i wasn't involved in that but the the lawyer who
originally you know she had kind of managed to get commutations for a few of these juveniles
who had done exceptionally well then um i as i mentioned to you earlier i had two or three years
where i was submitting petitions and getting denied and i denied and i then what happened is she granted the
first doc department of corrections commutation to a woman client of mine in february of 2020 then
covert happened and i think covert then she let out a couple more of our clients in like april or may of
that year and then george floyd died and when george floyd died i think it gave her she was already
really interested in doing it but i think she became very interested in how black people had
been treated in the system in oregon and so she wanted to help out people who people of color
more which is a slight issue in oregon because 92 of the prison population is white so you know it's
it's not just black people who are getting poorly treated in oregon it's it's everyone you know and so
that that thing happened and happened and so she granted quite a few commutations maybe i was getting
a commutation a month through covid or maybe every six weeks i was getting competitions for incredible
people because i i was able to write because i was there doing it first i kind of was able to pick
these amazing people to do clemency and then the media got wind of it so in april 2022 then i had one
client get out and it went it the media got hold of it because it was the primaries were going on
the da races the the the governor was up there was an election coming up and the media got onto it and
i remember my client had got out the week before i go to england i i get to the airport at heathrow
and i see woke governor releases convicted murderer and i'm my 18 year old client and i'm like oh god
you know and the door shut now she did grant a few more right at the end of her term but basically the
door shut in that moment the media turned nasty and the commutation they stopped wow yeah thank you
for telling that story that's so important you can see the machinations of those monolithic processes
there right they're like yeah this this little thing over here we're going to shut that down
yeah that's not part of our process and you can see other features of these processes in what you
were talking about earlier the work i've done as a prosecutor right uh what what's going on there is
the prosecutor has no interest in justice what they've done is they've equated their personal identity
which has been essentially counterfeited right because they're just somebody who puts people in
prison now so they've equated their personal identity with keeping people in prison and any
any threat to those people any threat that could um arise any opportunity that could arise to release
those people becomes a threat to their personal identity this has nothing to do with justice it has
nothing to do with law it has to do with a human being being hollowed out inside and becoming like
i punish criminals right i am a yeah like a golem or an automaton i work for this process that tortures
humans yeah i mean i think they see it as they they would be talking about you know the the jury process
if it went to trial and you're undermining the will of the jury who don't you know or alternatively if
they pleaded they're lying this person's lying that's not what happened even though they don't
know what happened because right there and it was a plea deal and so that those that would be their
arguments or that would be their justifications um but what i'm trying to really what it is is that
they don't want and they would see the clemency power which is in the constitution it was put in
the oregon constitution like most constitutions it came from the federal constitution and the idea
as the founder said was that justice can be very harsh and they wanted a mechanism for merciful for
mercy to be given within the system because it's needed because justice justice system doesn't always
work as it's intended and for that it was put into the oregon constitution and they saw the use of
it as lawlessness as the governor running roughshod over the law but it was the ultimate law it's in the
constitution that's higher than any statute that the legislature's passed but they saw it as lawless
behavior of the governor that had to be stopped and it did this this thing the like the media and
these prosecutors and even the governor they're complicit they have become organs of an inhuman process
that is dominating our culture and our lives and it's producing crime
what i want to make very clear is that if we're actually concerned go ahead yes but also they're
criminalizing things that shouldn't be so yes obviously serious crimes murder and like armed rob
we all know those crimes but you know i've seen people go into prison for things that are just asinine you
you know i'm just i'm reminded of this one 15 year old who i worked with at one point who who
was outside it was new year's eve he's outside a market a man walks out of the market with a six
pack of beer and you know he rushes the guy shoves him grabs a six pack of beer and runs
five years 15 year old five years in prison and a felony conviction is that really rise is that really
what we want to do put him in prison for the rest of his high school years was he black what was he
black no he was white ah um is oregon though so most people are white but the governor did give him
clemency say again the governor did grant him a commutation ah excellent yeah but i mean i'm like
what are you doing putting him in like charging him with like why why are you doing this this is not
gonna help anyone yeah six five years yeah it's ridiculous yeah again cruel and unusual has an
actual scope right and if you're but the weird thing is it's like um what we're doing is so absurd
that cruel and unusual is the spirit of the thing so how can you use that to object well most americans
are so unaware like you know you like you know i'll say hey you know that we have the highest level of
incarceration in the world we're really only in line with like belarus and russia and china and
even then we may be worse than them in some ways and maybe nicer in other ways i mean no first world
country criminalizes and incarcerates people like we do you do know that the longest sentence in most
countries in europe is less than 20 years you do know that like you know no they don't they think
they they assume that this is normal yeah this is um this is absolutely draconian yeah and it's been
this way here for a long long time yeah i mean it's definitely been you know i mean if you look at your
history i mean obviously well in many you know we had the death penalty but so did most countries at you
know like that was something that people have got rid of you know it's something that we haven't got
rid of it still shocking to me um you know really there's no more i mean i don't know how any
justification exists to execute citizens having the state having the power to kill citizens just
in a country where we have only one person's dead so let's kill another i know
it's it's just i i always the best film i've ever watched on that was did you ever
ever watch dead man walking yes love that film i wrote i wrote poems i was crushed it ruined me
and i can't watch that film again but i've never seen anything really captured to me
that just the grief that comes in every direction from a crime when it happens yeah it's this thing
where like i mean it's god there's so much i want to say how can i articulate this
it's a fundamental violation not merely of our humanity but of the nature of being
it it's like a stain on our planet or not just our people like as a stain on the universe it's it's
it's fundamentally wrong in such a catastrophic way what we're what it's not we that do this but what
these processes do it's been done in our names so to speak exactly yeah um
oh my gosh i've had i'm having the same problem you had um where you lost your training i know i
have i have all these great thoughts that disappear immediately now we're getting older yeah um did you
actually say that 92 of the prison population in oregon is white something like that yeah i think so
yeah i mean it's a very white state wow it may not be i can probably double check that but i'm sure
it's close to that i think i may be off by a few percent but yeah it is not that's not
representative of the rest of the country you know you know there's this other thing that i know about
because i have a friend who's currently in prison and um he talked about when he went into the prison i
just want to mention this briefly that there's there's sort of like a layered array of poisonous
cultures in there right so um when when he when he went to the prison that he's in he had to join
what's called a car do you know what do you have you heard this yeah he was in california yeah i know
california is much more racial in the way it's broken down yeah you have to go in i mean from what i i don't
know i've only been into one california prison and it was a woman's prison so i don't know
that culture um but yeah i've heard that in california you have to you have to go by race
you can't deviate from that and so yeah so yeah if i remember what he told me
and i'm probably going to get it a little bit wrong but i'll try for the record just to say something
about it there's um there's like a black car there are two hispanic cars one's super ganged up
and the other one's a little less violent um
there's a a sort of a what would you even call it like a
white supremacist car right and then there's the worst car of all which is what most of the sex
offenders belong to yep um and those people just get picked on and it's a complex hierarchy of power
within each of the cars and the cars negotiate your fate it's i don't think it's not so defined in
oregon but sex offenders absolutely are have the worst time in prison um now what's in what we as
lawyers are interesting the rape murderers don't do so badly um so you know you're definitely better
off you know murder's better than sex crime of any kind really um but yeah so people any kind of sex
offender has got a diff is going to have a difficult time in prison um and obviously there there are
gangs naturally um but it's not you don't you can avoid that quite easily in oregon if you don't
want to be a part of it now if you come from a gang when you go into prison it's going to be harder
for you to separate from the gang in prison leaving a if you're a gang member and you want to renounce
being a gang member that is very difficult but it can be done i have clients who've done it i mean let's
be clear about what very difficult means it means beatings rape or death yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah i
mean you yeah it's very very difficult you you're going to get a lot of trouble so my point is that um
i mean actually i don't have a specific point i just want to be very clear about something
and and i don't know how it is in states other than california
um but here you have to pick a car and you may be you know if if your crime had something to do
with sex then you're automatically generally in and there might be another car or two that i didn't
mention those are the ones i can remember from from when i went to you know visit my friend and talk
to him about like what's going on and um so what i'm trying to get at is
the people in prison are not merely punished by being in a cage they are subjected to the scrutiny and
extremely harsh authority of gang leaders um criminal essentially there's there's like a there's a
separate government inside the prison systems and whether there's cars or not in oregon you can bet
there's a government of among the prisoners oh yeah punish each other and torment and torture each other
based on their sense of some kind of malignant shadow version of what the people on the outside
think should happen to criminals you follow me oh very much so i mean prison politics as we call it
is just i mean as a as a lawyer i'm just like oh i can't stand it like because you know the constant
political is you know you're saying if you get too involved in the politics you can end up in trouble in
prison but it is it's it's you're right they they police each other they they and then and then and
then you know the minorities are you know if you're a minority within a minority within a minority
so you know like i was talking to some of my uh one of my black clients in oregon prisons he's like
we're the most hated minority within the most hated minority of you know because we're we're not
just we're not just prisoners now we're black prisoners so we have like every you know in oregon
there is a mat they're a tiny minority so they've really the blacks prisoners have to really stick
together um because they're in such a minority in the prison but yeah no they they just make each
other's lives hell and all the rules and and all of that stuff it just we're always just like as a
lawyer i'm just i can't stand it when my clients get involved in all of that because it's just they
always end up in the hole they always end up in segregation and you can get into you can get like
i also have to deal with people trying to get out of prison and how your what your prison record
is will define a lot of the time whether you're getting out of prison and so you know it can be
really really i mean your whole life is fraught by these insane racial politics that you can't control
that or want no part in you know and i have i have some of my clients who've talked to me about
the hell of being in in segregation for you know you're in solitary for two years
in a in next to a bunch of white supremacists who are talking about you know eugenics all day long
in front of you and like trying to bait you into violence or so i mean it's really horrible it's
just a horrible toxic environment you know intentionally so obviously you know it's also um
it's much worse for people who already belong to any marginalized class um
it's vastly more dangerous for them and what i'm trying to to say here is that the idea of a prison
sentence no one can be sure it's not a death sentence oh definitely yeah and then a lot of cases we
haven't talked about medical neglect which creates oh yeah let's go there i mean on time i'm i'm
willing to stay as long as you know and we can someone standing i have i just received a message
from someone wanting to know i've got i probably got at least another 10 minutes so let's talk about
medical neglect yeah but i want to say just a couple things briefly before that um when you when a
person is accused of a crime and this is super important what happens is they'll in many cases
unless it's just a single charge they'll stack up an array of charges and they'll go like okay we're
going to try you for this and this and this and this and this and this and this or you can plea to this
yes that's correct that's how they do it so they charge you with attempted murder um assault one assault
two in fact what you did is you were rather unpleasant he slapped your roommate or punched your
roommate let's say um and so and i had a sunset a guy like this who he's facing 20 years in prison
most people will take seven years when really they should have got 90 days right you know and yeah that
is that is how it works you know they overcharge i've known two or three people who i'm pretty certain
didn't commit a crime yeah but compared to trying to litigate and go through the jury process on six
accusations the risk is too great you know it's way too great you can end up in prison for 30 years
one of the one of the most sort of obnoxious elements of the plea deal process is the idea that
you're going into contract and the whole idea of a contract is that the parties parties have equal power
so if you and me want to go into contract with each other on anything you know you we're both we both
can walk away equally we've both got equal power and therefore the contract is fair right but you've
got somebody who's sitting in jail and you've got a prosecutor who's got all the power and they're
saying well you can go you go to trial and you'll be in prison for 20 years or take this deal for five
years and so they're like i'll take it but i didn't do anything you know i didn't do anything
prison and they're like oh why did i take that deal i shouldn't have taken that deal i didn't do
anything wrong i'm going to try and challenge my conviction and no one in the world cares because
you took a plea deal which means you accepted guilt and so you're done you know and no one really
and at the time their face it's so it's so awful you know and it's not i mean with the plea deal
system alone we should be ashamed of i mean back up until the 70s it was considered a really nasty
thing a plea deal like a very corrupt backroom thing and now it's just that's how the system works
exactly and by the way i just want to be clear that as time progresses this is the this is the the
spirit of the game right we keep importing new malignancies to the process over and over again
and then it's just like oh this is how we do it you know yeah no absolutely and the case law
you know you know there's no i mean i fight a lot of this because i do these post-conviction cases for
people and you know it's really difficult because you've got these people who've taken these plea deals
they shouldn't have taken probably but at the same time their defense attorney had no leverage
you know that the defense attorney has given them good advice which is that if you go to trial you
could end up in prison for 20 years and frankly you know the process you know the juries you know
do you want to really risk that with a jury you know or we could just take this deal and like you
know and and you know it's just there's no good there's no good outcome here for this person and
you know they're angry with their defense attorney and the defense attorneys have usually got
you know an insane heavy insanely heavy caseload so they look at these plea deals and they're thinking
this is this is the best option for them you know i mean it's it's it's it's um it's blackmail
basically my belief is if if you're if you're indicted you're unless you get really lucky
you know and if you're and anyone can be indicted by a grand jury um because what the grand jury process
is just you know mad basically the prosecutor goes in to and only recently did we even start
seeing transcripts in oregon before then we would just get some notes and they can basically say this
is what happened they tell there's no real there's no ability to defend it and this is a crime has
happened the grand jury pretty much always are going to indict and so if the prosecutor is interested in
you for a crime and they can get a grand jury to indict which takes no effort you're fucked
yes the slipperiest of slopes yeah medical neglect yeah well you know i should get one of my friends
to talk to you about that who do medical habeas cases because it's sickening but basically uh they
don't you know they're trying they're trying to kill the club they're trying to kill all my clients
no but i mean i've had they literally some of the inhumanity and the neglect is just unbelievable
people dying of cancer left right and center who shouldn't be dying not getting the care that
they've been mandated by doctors i had a client who died of cancer in prison a couple of years ago he
shouldn't have died you know they he there was over nine months after the scan showing he had cancer
before anything was done nine months sitting there with no medical attention and then by the time he
needed chemo and when it was getting really they would um keep him they would they would deny him
medic they would wouldn't take him to the hospital for more than like one out of six appointments for
chemo they they just do this all the time they deny the medication that they they ignore medical
they it's just awful it i can't even articulate it like the food that they're eating is poison
like the women had so many stomach problems i mean the ibs level and and all the diverticulitis
and all of that is like off the charts you know i mean and then the food that they're eating is
you know the average woman in oregon puts on 50 pounds in the first year of being incarcerated
and it said to do with depression the sedentary lifestyle and then the garbage they're eating
you know it's so i i i'm i actually can't handle it i have two of my best lawyer friends do medical
habeas cases where they fight that they fight with doc to get medical care for prisoners i couldn't do it
i don't have the stomach for it it's too painful and awful to see this kind of neglect going on on a
daily basis but if you want to explore that i'm more than happy to connect you with someone
i would i would like to explore that and it's you know it's conceivable that we can have a second
conversation as well i know that you you your time you know is limited now and you have to go
i have a boyfriend waiting outside of the house oh really oh my goodness i'm sorry um
no it's fine okay um well third boyfriend
i just you know i think you've i i don't think that it was your goal to do this but you have become
by choosing what you've chosen to do you've become sort of like an angel in human skin you've if you
got one person out i know that you're that you you're really concerned and you feel like wow it's
it's a drop in a buck in in a in a swimming pool i know it is i mean i don't deny that my i'm so happy
for every one of my clients that they get to live in freedom they get to like for a lot of them it was
having the ability to die free and and i understand how important that is but i think we all feel like
we were all new lawyers myself and some of the other of my friends who did it at the same time you know
we you know the door shut and a lot of people got left behind that shouldn't have got left behind
you know that we weren't able to get out and may never get out and you know it's dark
it is i get it um i hope that you might be open to having a second conversation so i think there's a
lot more we can we can oh yeah i'd love i'd love to it's really great chatting this is so brilliant i
am so grateful venetia for your spirit and your heart and your work in the world i feel like you
like you vicariously have carried this burden you know for that many of us feel but you actually
walked into the trenches as a human being and did it and i i just celebrate that and i honor it
