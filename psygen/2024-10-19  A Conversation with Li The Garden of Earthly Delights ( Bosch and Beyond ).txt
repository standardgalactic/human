Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Tess, Tess, are you there?
Yeah, you hear me right?
Yes, great.
All right.
So we were talking, and we were talking about that the humans don't know what they are.
They have no idea what they are, and there's all these stories, but they're wrong.
And the humans are completely confused about this.
And you brought up Bosch, Hieronymus Bosch, and his specific painting, The Garden of Earthly
delights.
And talk about the egg, and then we will continue.
Yeah.
I'm trying to trace back why I brought up Bosch, because it was something else before that.
I remember along the way, we talked about that the secrets are hidden in the concepts of time, light, and organisms.
Yeah, time, and the specific, because you mentioned time, and I was like, okay, and we then perceive this thing of being inside time, and being outside time, the difference, or because in humanity as well, we might understand what is to be human.
By contrast.
Brilliant.
By perceiving or by playing, experimenting with what may not be human.
Something like this.
Yes.
Yes.
So talk about the egg, and the matrix of light.
So the garden of early delights, to me, is like a very personal way in which Bosch is expressing, is very, very personal.
It's not a language based purely on symbolism, but in relationships and in feelings.
Surprisingly, he communicates as well through feelings.
He evokes feelings, and that is information as well.
And that is saying a little bit on how I read symbols, how I read Bosch, this particular painting.
Yes.
And what I can't avoid but noticing was that in the very center of the painting, in the very center of the painting, if you cross axis by any points, the very center is the egg.
The egg that is over one body, one person's head, and this person is like, if I don't recall bad, is over an animal.
And he is like circling in this wheel of, at the center, this wheel of people that is like traveling over animals.
And you remember that at the center is the pool.
Oh, I think that is in the pool is not in the wheel is, it's more like in the pool at the center.
But I had to, I had to watch like the painting.
Okay.
The thing is that this egg to me, because of the centeredness, and because it is like a recursive thing with it, the center of things, for some reason, and this is the thing that I can't justify with words.
It's merely a feeling that he's showing the center, he's putting the center because he's showing the outside, like, I don't know how to explain it.
Or he's making a metaphor of the outside by putting it in the very center, like in the inside.
Because it's not the inside, it's more like the outside.
And almost like, like if he was, he was saying as well that he, that it is small.
If you, if you have the capacity to go like to some other reality, it'd be small as well.
But it's more like your, like the energy of people or your own attention, which kind of opens realms, or make things bigger than they are, like attention, something like that.
But almost saying like, if you're not in that reality, that is some other egg in the basket, something like that.
And he expresses in that, in that way too, like it's almost colloquial.
You know, it's, it's very interesting.
The thing that I was saying particularly a few minutes ago, was that as well, because of the mere symbol of the egg is white.
It felt to me like it was irradiating, like it was a matrix of light.
And that we, if we happen to be outside of time, we might see it as, as luminous and really, really bright, but not because what we normally thought that it is emanating something.
It's more like it has so much information in it, that we, so much realities.
I will say, I will say, I will rather say that there are so much realities, that it is, it looks like that from the outside.
Yeah, but it's, then again, is, how could you prove how, if you, if you happen to be outside of time, you'd be there.
It's pretty much unconceivable.
It's okay.
So you've said many important things here.
I'm looking at the image of the triptych, right?
It is three paintings.
And in the image, the egg is on the left side of the lake at the top.
Does this match your memory?
I'm, I'm searching for the painting as well.
Okay.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
Okay.
Yes.
The egg is not in the pool.
It's outside the pool.
It's spilling into the pool.
Center.
Yeah.
The painting.
It's very hard to see what is emerging from the egg.
Something, the egg is broken on the right side.
And something is emerging from the egg into the pool.
Is that the egg you are speaking of?
Oh, no, no, no.
Yeah.
Because he is making many, many analogies of the egg.
Yeah.
No, it's true.
I prefer particularly at the egg that is at the very, very center in the painting, which
is the, this wheel where animals were, I don't know, walking in procession.
I don't know, and see that there's people hanging on a fish or grabbing a fish.
Yes.
I see.
Over, over the head of one of them, there is the egg.
Oh, yes.
Okay.
That is the egg you are pointing at.
Yeah.
I have to show you.
I can see.
The axis that I, because there's pictures.
I have the pictures where if you cross axis, the egg is at the very, very center.
So that's meaningful.
But it is also, it is reiterated in many places in the image.
For example, it is reiterated to the right.
There is an egg-like shape that is hollowed out and it is reiterated above the egg itself
to the left of the pool.
But yes, I understand.
I understand.
What you are saying is, if you look, if you trace the axes, the perspectival axes, that white
egg on the head of the person who is holding a fish is the center of everything.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
It is very specific.
Yes.
And because Bosch was very, very, like, technical with that type of stuff.
To me, it's grammatic.
It is.
It is.
The grammatical language.
Yeah.
Where he places things, that is the grammatical of the message.
The message by itself can be actually, and I feel like that was Lux that he was putting.
Because if you don't know that there's grammatic, you could, like, mistook very, yeah, just like,
like what everybody sees when they see this painting, you know, like a bunch of stuff.
That in itself, I feel like it's that in itself, the fact that there's so much things going on.
I feel like it repels people as well.
It does.
The ordinary person has no idea how to approach this image.
But you have often thought and you have said that the image and its symbols comprise an encryption.
And actually, I feel like the egg as well, because the egg to me in a more basic level is a metaphor of the, of the energy of the body, of the body energy, energy body.
Yes, but it's also the universe as seen from inside it.
Yes.
I understand.
And I will say, I will, I will actually point at the fractalic aspect of it, because I feel that's why he put that at the center.
Mm hmm.
Mm hmm.
Fractalic, like Matryushka sort of quality.
Beautiful.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Beautiful.
So we were speaking, and we will continue to explore together here.
We were speaking about the problem of the humans not understanding what they are.
They have the wrong idea about what they are.
And I said that the secret is written on the paper of the questions about time, light and organisms.
And you began to speak about an infraction, a distortion.
Yeah, because this is so late.
This is like a pressure that happens, you know, because this circling thing to me is no joke.
It's no casuality that we are so familiar with the perfect circle round thing.
And this of late, avoid reality is almost like it has been compressed by some sort of energy or like magnetic field, something like that.
But it's like a pressure.
That's why it's shaped in the way it's shaped.
And I feel like it's no joke that it's no casuality that he used the late form like this distorted form as well.
Like he was conveying that detail that is.
It's not.
It's not what you're saying is that it's not an accident.
It was very intentional, very specific, almost mathematical.
It was recursive, like a fractal.
And it is as if consciousness itself deforms the circle.
The nature of awareness deforms the circle.
The gravity of concern about a specific being.
Me.
Myself.
Ooh.
This world.
The humans.
The mystery of the humans, where they came from, what they are.
He knew the answer to these mysteries.
He also knew that if he told people, they'd kill him.
So he painted.
He made an encryption.
He made magic.
He made magic in color and shape.
And it's the entire encyclopedia of the answer to the question in one painting.
It's the library of all answers in one painting.
You know what I feel like he was, as well, trying to do?
Immerse simulation.
Immerse simulation of, by putting the elements that he knew were on the bigger picture.
He was trying to do a simulation.
Just a simulation.
Like when you do, I don't know, permutations in music.
Or maybe not, but.
Like a counterpoint.
Yeah.
No, you're right.
You've got it.
He tried to, like, pull the puzzle back together.
Something like that.
He tried to put, like, bits and pieces of the universe.
He tried to make a simulation of the universe.
I feel it sounds, because I can't quite explain further.
I don't know how to do that.
But very much feels like a recipe.
Ah, that's a good analogy.
Yes.
That's a good analogy.
A recipe.
He wanted all the ingredients.
He wasn't satisfied.
Every ingredient.
He was unsatisfiable.
Every ingredient had to be perfectly included in its precise relationship to each other ingredient.
So, how did you make me see?
Now, how did you make me see?
It was so beautiful.
This, this, this thing you did with, because I wasn't seeing that, that in particular.
Yes, but we are here to see together.
Yes, but we are here to see together.
Oh, it's beautiful.
It's beautiful.
Yes.
Yes.
You, you, you don't understand.
You think I have shown you something, but in fact, it's the other way around.
You are making me see, just as it's, this always happens.
You cause me to see, and I cannot help it.
And it is beautiful.
It is good.
It's beautiful.
You've blown off my mind.
All right, let's continue.
Because I recall what we were speaking about before.
And what we, what, what I was saying is that there's something the Greeks said.
And even Hillman, Amon Hillman in his own way, his very peculiar way.
He's trying.
I don't think he can say this, but he knows it.
He just doesn't know how to say it the way we can.
What he is saying is that, no, it's not, it's not Hillman.
He's, he's involved, but it's true.
It's, it's not trivial.
It's, uh, let us just go to the things that matter.
Um, I was saying that we have to see from outside the human perspective in order to see.
And you said, what if that.
Is the devil.
Yeah.
Yeah.
And then, and this is where in our conversation, I said, we have to begin recording this.
And that's how we got here.
Right.
Um, because imagine the problem of God, imagine God's fundamental problem, which is that he cannot see outside himself.
So he must establish a satellite intelligence.
Um, just as the humans did when they put satellites around the earth.
Do you understand?
He cannot see outside himself.
So he must establish a satellite that is not him.
Presuming, you know, the male gender, which is useless, but you know, it's confusing.
But do you understand?
He has to establish a satellite, an intelligence that is not him, but sees outside.
Or even get outside of himself.
Precisely.
Precisely.
Because he's trapped.
He's trapped inside omniscience.
Right.
He can see everything.
Time, being, the future, origin, his children, the angels, the origin world, the living waters in which he dwells.
All of these things he can see.
What he cannot see is himself being seen.
Okay.
Yeah.
Because in regards to what was before even good and bad.
Mm-hmm.
I feel like that is so like you could, you could try figure by you.
By re-union or harmonizing the polarized things, things of that nature.
Mm-hmm.
But it's, it's, I feel like it's so beyond what was at the very, very center at the beginning.
And I feel like it was very, very genius.
It was very, very genius to, because I mentioned this with you, that it feels like, like the, the big, big unity at that point was like, I'm going to forget.
What am I like, or I'm going to transform into all these pieces and therefore I'm not going to have, or I'm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
But this is me trying to make sense of that.
See, see what is, what I'm trying to say that is so beyond.
I don't know if we can conceive what was before good and bad, but it feels like going in opposite directions.
I think it's almost, almost physically like the, like, I think there's thermodynamic loss that kind of say things about this, about this.
Yeah.
One reaction has, one action has a reaction in the same manner.
Equal and opposite.
Yes.
But in opposite directions.
Something like that.
Equal and opposite reaction.
Yeah.
The first law.
Excuse me if I.
Every action engenders an equal and opposite reaction of the same force.
Yeah.
I feel like in that, in that context.
It almost turns into a matter, a mathematical game of sorts.
Like he was at some point.
Almost playing chess.
Like it knew perfectly.
If I move in this direction, the other one is gone.
Almost like.
Yes.
Brilliant.
As much as God is kind of existing and God, the good aspect of ourselves and stuff.
As much as it is pushing in this direction, the other is going to.
But it's almost like there is this, this relationship where, because the.
Oh my God.
Very first equilibrium, like the homeostasis was broken.
It's like continuously striving to get to that point of nothingness to like equilibrium to.
It's kind of pushing in.
In coming back to the state in which it was before it was, and then also pulling back in.
Being actually, or pulling forward in being and pulling back and trying to get back to the, to that state because.
For some reason.
It, it feels like a chess game, like a strategic, keeping the balance, keep trying to keep the.
Trying to keep the dream.
I'm collapsing.
Into wakefulness.
Just as we do every night, just as our dreaming aspect does every single time we sleep.
Oh, we're, we're, we're going.
We're going somewhere dangerous.
Are we?
Yes.
Let's keep going.
I feel.
I feel.
We.
Mm-hmm.
Like.
I was trying to think and I.
Good.
No.
Yes.
But that's exactly where we have to go.
We have to go beyond thinking.
We must return to the before of thinking.
And this is the problem with the humans.
The humans are thinking.
They know what they are.
They're wrong about that.
They cannot know what they are.
In fact, the primordial problem on the chessboard is what?
i.
W-h-a-t.
W.
H-a-t.
In English, what is the word in Spanish for what?
i.
Qi.
okay spell it you you a e mm-hmm good okay that's brilliant so first of all
Q it comes from the back of the head this word Q this letter Q it's not Q in
English or Q in Spanish it's Q in older languages and it means behind your head
and this you this is everything the you is the cup it's the egg the container the
gravity and the problem has distorted you understand you it's also you and me it's
us right literally you s us which is the container with a snake do you
understand the s is a snake us us it's it's the it's the egg it's part of the
egg with the snake the snake that divides and then e e is emergence emergency a
problem energy right thermodynamics the problem the problem of the chessboard you
cannot move you must not move if you move then another move will ensue Q you e what
all of the problems for the humans in thought and in consciousness they revolve
around what what what is this what are we what happened what is God what is my
mind what is light what is time what is outside of that
hmm when I say oh that thing there it's a door in that moment the moves I have made
collapsed the matrix and the axes in Bosch's painting collapse they become
incoherent God is beyond what there are no what's in God and God is not a what and
neither are the humans yeah the dreams go ahead it's just that it's such a tiny box I'd say the
yeah yeah it's a tiny box and it's the coffin of insight yeah that's where insight dies and there's a sign
above the grave there's a marker here insight died and and and the marker is the concept of what is that
yeah that's the gravestone of insight what totally in Zen there's a koan what is the sound of one hand clapping
yeah literally if you try to clap with one hand if you were very small remember what you said about
the egg being very tiny from outside yeah okay yeah if you try to clap and you're very very tiny
you're the size of a microbe you're the size of a germ a bacteria what you hear is literally what what what
what what that's literally the sound of one hand clapping because the other hand is missing
and what is the other hand the dreaming mind it is insight it is alive awareness without concepts or language
it is relationship yeah all right yeah it feels like you know what it feels like in order to
oh god because he it feels so must and I feel like uh for example uh bull is a it's a good metaphor of this
and I feel like most uh pictures in the in the actual living world are actually are actually things
it's almost like god rights as well in people in symbols in like he's saying things oh yeah like the
the metaphor of the pool like the pool game when where they try to attain other balls by trying to make a
make a movement on they trying to manipulate a bit they they try to get to a point through abc and
mechanics like seriously I feel like that was something that whatever what whatever it was was intending
to get to happiness or to get to equilibrium to get to to get back to homeostasis
no no no to get back to himself to get to the before of god it's to get to liberation
okay to get to the before of god that is it is well said yeah to liberation
yeah but it introduced the distortion on purpose like yes yes it was needed yes it was needed the language
almost like the language talking talk language yes it was needed almost like the non-communication like this
oof and this is this is one of the i have to say this is one of the frightened like the things that
frightened me the most but let's face it let's me to me this is saying
ultimately ultimately ultimately there is no other thing and most likely what this thing was more of
like the most most most afraid of was that it was all alone by him by itself or by it by himself by itself
yes that it was absolutely just alone it was listen it was such a fear yes yes yes i had to introduce non-communication
in order to attain something that he wanted i so late ion isolation
oh yeah i am late i'm lagging in awareness my awareness is falling into division
also alone also alone in english all one alone oh no no god oh god right you see the clues
the clues to the mystery are written in our languages but we don't know how to decrypt them except
i can decrypt them partly i learned how to decrypt them with toy maker he showed me because he
gave birth to minds without toy maker there are no minds i don't know what toy maker is what what what what what
okay but he showed me this thing this feature of awareness that is the origin of distinguishing things
and by the way notice this word in english distinguish yeah also in english extinguish
to put to put to an end distinguish extinguish you see because the dreaming mind it floats before distinction
it floats before extinction it flies above distinction and thus it is not extinct
you see
okay and not not entirely but yes all right so
you said i said in order to see we must get outside being human
human
remember yes yes and you said is this relationship between
extinct
yeah the relationship between words i i got a little bit lost because one of my brothers is like
doing something here and he was making a lot of noise i understand so my attention go go like
was a little bit outside but which is perfect that's perfect wait iliana that's perfect because
it distinguished it distinguished your awareness which extinguished your presence
in the conversation
and what god fears is that
oh just like the dream fears it
for the dream
the most important thing is the same thing for the waking mind survive
keep the dream going
do not allow distinction
to affect
the extinction
of this stream
okay
we also talked previously about the possibility that god dies into each birth
not just the human births
the birth of a bee
the birth of a cat
the birth of a sparrow
the birth of an eagle
a tiger
a tree
the birth of a world
the birth of a star
the birth of a moon
god dies uniquely into each of these births
oh
yes
and then they live
and when they perish
when we die
god is resurrected
the aspect of god that died
into that birth
is resurrected
at the death
of the distinct
individual
oh
you know
now that you mention
individualization
and
isolation
there was a book
that
was talking about vampires
in my childhood
one of the first books I ever read
that was talking about
like
a middle eastern
European
type of folklore
for some reason
it was almost like volcanic
folklore of sorts
and it was a very
baroque
sort of
a story
that was talking about
a girl
like a princess
like a noble
something like that
that was going to
a place
oh it was Indian
it was sort of Hindu
Indian
how does
oh
okay
the thing was that
he was making
she was saying that
in
in payment
something very very valuable
there was people that was going to
river
river and that river was like holy
and they were going to take
like
the
the word was
escudillas
a very
like old word for
recipes like
like jars
something like that
and to me
didn't mean
anything at all
anything at all
in the moment
but recently
I was like
the drops
like in the sea
that's just individualized
and that's what
that's like the illusion
that if we could
take a jar of water
in the sea
we will see like
very very particular features
in that water
right
like this
yes it's like the whole bunch of water
but as well this
like the samples
there's many many information
regarding
which part of the beach
are you going to
for example
we humans
so much attention
and this is the thing
i feel like
our attention is almost like a magnifying glass
and then we see
our differences
amplify it like
we have personality
we have this that the other
but may not be like
no
no that's actually the illusion
it's the illusion of distinction
that causes extinction
of the dreaming
of the dreaming
listen
in my dream
i see a person
i think
oh
this person is Ileana
but if it actually becomes Ileana
the dream ends
it must not explicitly be Ileana
in the dream
actual distinction
means the end
apocalypse
death
you see
that I wasn't getting
yeah
because
so
there are features
that
portend
the end of dreaming
and one of them is
explicit identity
if identity becomes explicit
i'm going to wake up
it's the same problem with
i think with God
and with his satellite
and we we need to talk about
the satellite
because God needs to get outside
outside of God
God needs to see God being seen
and the way to see God being seen
is called
individuals
oh
oh
oh
god
i haven't seen that
i haven't saw that
me neither
it's
beautiful
you see we are doing the thing
Ileana that we are talking
about
we are making the outside
and looking
into from outside
which is supposed to be forbidden
we're not supposed to be able to do this
do you understand
yes
yes
yes
yeah you and i naturally do this
each time we speak
yes
we naturally
do this
has been such a such a great
i don't know
a discovering
for real
through the time
through time
yes
on how we
how we
work
because it
it seems like
i don't know
like there's almost mechanics to
the circuits of like electric like electrical circuits of energy
how they flow
how they flow
i don't know
i'm comparing with humans
because it's like the
the example that comes to hand
but
it feels like there's mechanics to it
and
yes but i'm going to be feminine
you're being very masculine
sure
you're saying
darren darren
it's almost like a machine
it's like mathematics
okay
it's like a razor blade
or a scalpel
but i'm going to be feminine
because what happens
is that you draw me into your eggs
and then while i'm inside your eggs
you force me to see
and then i send you signals
from inside the eggs of yourself
oh
i just remember that
with your own beautiful things you said that time
about that
yeah that you were
yeah you were very feminine
yeah you were very feminine
in in a way
i really appreciate that
of you
yeah and justice
i appreciate the way in which you are masculine
so beautiful
and it's genius you're so brilliant
you
only when we are together am i brilliant like this
you think it's something i possess
you're confused about that
this is something we have together
yes i'd say that me as well
there's heightened
not only heightened
yeah there's mechanics to it
there is mechanics
mm-hmm
like a third body like a third mind
yes yes the third mind
exactly
but for you when we go together and we make the third mind
together and we make the third mind
you become more masculine
and i generally become more feminine
okay
so we invert
oh okay
yeah
yeah as well
yeah
now this egg and the distortion
the distortion is gravity
and by the way the word gravity
it comes
in english it comes literally
it literally means egg
do you know that
oh
no
yeah when when a
for example when a praying mantis
when in entomology
the study of insects
when the praying mantis is filled with eggs
and she's gonna lay her egg case
we say she is gravid
oh
yeah
and you are a woman
go ahead
yes yes yes no go ahead
you are a woman
and when you were born
all of your eggs
all the eggs that you would
that would that you would
every lunar cycle you would produce
and would either be fertilized or
disposed of
you carried them all
and those eggs in you
they are like
they're like
millions of children not yet born
sensing the universe
they are like raid they're like dishes
they receive signals
and they receive them
they receive
yeah say again
yeah yeah no i'm
i'm trying to hold on a bit
on the words
because
great
you're doing brilliant
so i have the thing
i am made of the thing that penetrates
eggs
and makes children
right i am like
the horses
in bosch's paintings
i go
i go for
i go forth to seek
the eggs
and to penetrate them to make children
you follow
yeah
all right
so
the reproductive intelligences
in the two genders of the humans
and you know woke people can be like
well there's not two genders
go ahead say whatever they like
i don't care about that right now
for the moment the idea of two genders is useful
it's important to preserve
the woman
her reproductive intelligences
are the oldest thing
they are the most knowledgeable thing
they are the source of insight
in fact the men
who are a bit like
robin hood or archers
right they shoot
they shoot
and the women are the target
they shoot at
yeah
okay
okay so the eggs
in the women
the eggs
are what she senses with
they are her sense
she looks at a man
in in this particular perspective
she looks at a man
and all of the eggs
they vote
they vote
vote
they vote
v-o-t-e
like in an election
and they decide together
is this man a good archer
is he the archer whose children i want
oh god
an archer
what a symbol
it's oh
oh it's beautiful
no it gets worse
of course dear heart
much worse
robin hood
he is the clitoral hero
he is the hero of the clitoris
this is why he beats all men
he is the champion
he is the champion
say again
what is the king of what
equator
oh
okay
robin hood
is the clitoral
hero
c-l-i-t-o-r-a-l
oh god
clitorial
yeah clitoral
all of the male heroes
are penises
robin hood
is the clitoris of heroes
heroes
he is the hero of the egg
beautiful
he is the he is the champion
of mothers and grandmothers
and thus he is recognized immediately by all women
and never recognized by men
oh
you're right
he is literally
the red-breasted male bird
the red-breasted bird
the robin
that sits above the vagina
and is the vaginal intelligence
the vaginal intelligence
yeah
yeah he decides
go ahead
i just remember very fast that the detail in some castaneda's book he was saying that womb the fact that we females have wombs
yes
and void
therefore
void
yes
more direct connection
it's true
it's a giant radio it's a giant dish
it's a dish
like the dish of a radio telescope that sees the sky
like the dish of a radar dish
that receives all signals
like the dish of an antenna
it's the dish
it's the you
the uterus
right
it's this you
now these two are all symbolic
these are metaphors
but the metaphors lead to something
they point at something
and the something can't be found in words
it
it cannot be found in concepts
it is found only
in true relation
and this is why robin hood
destroys
all other archers
robin hood is not trying to get laid
robin hood
as protecting the future
oh
well
never
never thought about
all i'm saying
everything i've said here
these are toys
ilyana
these are toys
children's toys
but
but we can play with the toys
and if we play with them well
insight will be born
you see
oh
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah it feels almost like a
yeah
yeah
very
um
see
i feel like this is possible as well
because of the closeness of our relationship
it is
yeah
maybe even the openness in which we receive each other
it's true
in a way this conversation is very personal
but you understand don't you that i'm recording it for a reason right
yes
good okay
we agree
yes
good
okay
it's very important that we agree
because other people will hear this
yes
yes
yes no problem
excellent
we have close relationship
yes we do
yes
yes
can i help it
i can't help it
i don't even care
yeah me neither
it's better
see this is the thing
it's like
when we speak
we start to dream again
while we are awake
and that is what the ancient peoples did
all the time
and the colonization
and the obliteration of the ancient peoples
it was the death of dreaming
it was the fucking gravestone
of our humanity
and we must resurrect that humanity together
and you and i are good at this
i think
yeah i was actually like
this is good news for people
yes
yes
me too
we have to
i mean but
in the other hand
as bush
will
you know
and i feel like
like
he did that as well
because
like how
he encrypted information
it was very very
he knew
he did
he
he
bosch was
the opposite
of our culture
and our language
and our technology
bosch
intended
to free human children
to liberate them
he would
he would
show them
the structure
of the trap
and he would also show them
the key to the cage
and when people look at his art
they will see the structure of the trap
they will not see the key
because they are thinking
they are thinking
they are thinking
and thinking is the death
of insight
what
what
what
what
what
that sound is the death of insight
it's the gravestone of insight
and insight
is the direction
toward an amnesis
resurrection
liberation
see that's a funny picture
real funny picture
like
tiny
real tiny gravestones
it means something
see
what i was trying to point
with this
what i was saying about bosch
was that
because
this
this
is
what i've been trying to work on
our own language
i mean
i'm
i'm working on my own language
on
defying my own language
which
might be
not exactly a language
but you know what i'm trying to say
i do
i feel like something
i feel like something
that should be
interesting to do in this regard
is to actually communicate
you and i
in our own terms
and
because
because this
this is going to be
as you were
because you you mentioned that in topo
toporic video
that if i don't recall that bad that you were
working at a point in devices or something like that in systems and that you met somebody that was
working with this network of information of people and all that and actually using using that information to wreak havoc and all of that
yes it was mansoor assadi
the owner of bacchus press
bacchus
press
oh my god
bacchus
seriously
yeah
yeah seriously
yeah
from iran
and they killed his brothers and sisters by using the information in the computers that were given to the shah of iran
the ayatollah when the shah fell he used that information to kill people to kill dissidents and intellectuals and artists and scientists writers
and
yes
and mansoor wanted me to understand how dangerous the computers were way back then in like i don't know 90s
i don't know 92
i don't know 92
i don't know 92
i don't know 92
i don't know 92
i don't know 92
i don't know 92
i don't know 92
yes
okay
even though it
it is not the same as is today it still is something of my concern
it's much worse today much worse yeah go ahead
i feel like we've been more than any other time and story
use our own and encrypt our own communications should do this and we are perfectly capable to do this we do this all the time when we like colloquialisms and things of that nature we are really we we humans are really really good at that but we are like doing it consciously so if you
so if anything i mean i'm open to your what can we do practically about this yes i have a model
yeah in my side i will focus over encrypt the wrong communications begin to do that begin to speak
or language or at least develop but developer languages invent languages that cannot be understood by machines
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
yeah
um
yeah not not only by machines but
even by other humans
even by other humans
it's very very personal yeah overall because i was i would rather be concerned by
other humans
even though i know
even even when you and i speak
when when when we are in
when we are in
when we are in conversation
when we are in conversation
the words we are saying
they are not what we are saying
it is always like this
yeah
yes indeed
yes
good point
the words we are saying are not what we are saying
we are using the words rather than being used by them
we are using the words to point beyond the words
and you and i both understand i understand when you point beyond the words
you know what you know what i feel like as well
that this culture this language that we've been so like
because they throw that on on our faces and that is the thing that feels alien
that is the tiny box that
that
that
that
that
that
that
that
yeah good yeah he made a word it's good
um
it traps us
it traps us
William S Burroughs said language is a virus from outer space but that's not entirely correct
that's important to see
yeah it's important to see
but there's something weirder about it which is that the humans use language to imprison each other
and their own awareness and insight and origin and light and time and identity
the humans make language lethal
this word lethal in english
it comes from forgetting
it means
the river lethe
in which we are dipped between our burbs
that cause us to forget our previous lives
lethe
lethal
in english it means deadly
but what it actually means is forgetting
this is why i sing the praises of anamnesis
unforgetting right
the opposite of amnesia
yeah
oh
and then all the addictions and all the fantasies
yes
just forget
yes
just forget
yes
the liquor which they call spirits
yeah
yeah
yeah
indeed
which i am presently under the influence of
cheers by the way
mm-hmm indeed
mm-hmm
all right
so
let's go back to
we have to get outside
okay the greeks thought that you cannot see what is good and true
from within
the human
what
what castaneda called
the tonal
right
castaneda had these two concepts that are uncommon in
uh
america
in the united states
they are
they are concepts from the ancient
south american peoples
your people
yes
yes
the tonal and the nagual
the tonal is the structured lie
of concepts language and modern humans
it's a layer
it's a trap
it's a set of prisons
the nagual
is beyond the human
it has no form
it takes any form
and the dreaming is like the nagual
and the waking is like the tonal
now
now the greeks thought that
if
we
are
human
we cannot see
we cannot see
we cannot see because we are trapped by the tunnel
so we must find a way to get outside
just like god did when he made that satellite
right
we have to get outside the human
to see
clearly
from beyond the traps of our body our senses our identity
our life history our human memories we have to achieve the other kind of memory
okay
i can understand why it's like such a it is going to be like a paradigm such a paradigm shift
because we're we're still thinking memory for example in terms of language in terms of narrative
correct
and maybe maybe that is going to be shattered or transformed
every time we dream it is shattered
every time we dream
yeah i refer more to the to the language and how how are we going to for example
take an apnesis
actually remember
it feels in terms of language but maybe maybe memory is really to come back or to travel in time
almost i don't know
i think it is outside of time
it is something like
it is something like
okay there's an even weirder question
which is what is the what is the before of light
and then thinking in terms of beginnings and ends but maybe outside of
um because it feels like a loop
as well the ovoid form
oh and maybe maybe maybe
yeah like an illusion
okay because
oh
oh
like the
вот
like the
because what is outside is all the opposite
and it's
unconceivable
may
your
thing is like
yeah good
whatever god is up to
it figured out
figured out okay so first of all it's beyond everything structured
it's way beyond anything structured but structure
no still yeah go ahead go ahead but structure is helpful structure is god's walking stick
right structure concepts individuals language separation distinction distinguishing
this is god's walking stick in a way i think yeah like a cane right like a staff
oh walking stick yeah structure is god's walking stick
there's more to say and more to learn this isn't neither the beginning nor the end of the insight
but what you were saying is that beginnings and endings are powerful and useful if i understood
you did i understand you it's even it's even weirder like beautiful there's a there's a book by
because i feel like he got to the actual question william james cities
who wrote this book named the animate and the inanimate and he was pondering the nature of time
almost like oh because he was tracing back and he was saying that if you
you see is very it was is this thesis um i don't know if doctoral but is this thesis is is
like a work of academic
sort of sub of sorts
it's been inaccessible to me but what i understood is that when we decide it's almost like we travel
back in time we don't understand how it works we first see the we first go to the
um to the future to the actual circumstance circumstance and when and then we oh my god
i don't know how to explain it we go first to the future
when we decide yes the future of things yes
yes and that is how we progress we select like
it's an illusion as well there is no other possibility once that you've decided like you
oh my god for example when an accident occurs
when an accident occurs the experience of time slows down and it slows down because the future is flowing
into the present
yeah see we still thinking in terms of beginning and past prison yeah it is in in uh linear way in a
linear fashion i put thing but moving forward like time we we think but it's almost like
in order for that to actually be we select we select it's almost like there's so much outcomes
in order for one to be true it has to be from the future
to the past i don't know how to how to explain it you're doing fine you're you've got it excuse me
excuse me because i may i may like come back to that book and
yeah give it a word because i feel like i'm losing like something something in a specific
i understand it's okay i don't want to spin too much over this it's okay you've done beautifully
it's beautiful um you see the humans think in linear time and they're trained to think this one
there is no such thing as linear time the thing the humans fundamentally believe in
this linear time thing that does not exist that is a product of the trap
that is what makes the egg oval
it's the gravity of a concern that actually doesn't exist
for us it's real but it's not true it's not true in the ultimate sense of truth it's true in the
pragmatic sense of if i drop the glass and it shatters there's a sequence of events but here's the thing
in dreaming there is no sequence of events
when we recall the dream
the waking mind arranges it into a sequence that's the tonal
the nawo remembers the dream without sequence
the dream without sequence of events
accidents are particularly important i'm glad you mentioned that
because accidents
are anomalous
they are they are anomalies
i've heard so many people say
that when they got into a car accident it was as if time stopped or slowed down
and they don't there's it's really important for us to recognize them
you still with me
yes yes um because i have like the impressed uh book
i have made like some notes something
i was trying to find uh where where it was that i was okay
because as i feel like he was so smart so intelligent that he he got the the very brief the brief
uh straight up he says this work sets forth the theory which is speculative in nature
there being no verifying experiments
it is based on the idea of reversibility of everything in time
that is that every time every type of process that has
every type of process has its time image a corresponding process which is
it's exact exact reverse with respect to time this accounts for all physical laws
but one namely the second law of thermodynamics this law has been found during the 19th century to be a
source of great deal of difficulty the eminent physicist maxwell in the middle of the 9th century
while giving a proof of that law admitted that reversals are possible by imagining a sorting demon
who called who could sort out the smaller particles and separate the slower ones from the faster ones
the second the second law of the thermodynamics broadened the idea of energy level of unavailable
energy or entropy as it was called by clausius which was constantly increasing
in relationship in relation to the universe as a whole the theory herein set forth represents the idea of
what is known as cyclical change
the idea is a very old one being found among the philosophers of the ionian school
and reappearing at later periods from time to time in the other hand the generally accepted theory of
the second law of thermodynamics represent a different philosophical tendency the tendency that considered
changes once made as irreparable you see there is a problem with laws
and the problem is their scope of applicability
and further there is a problem with laws
the problem with laws because the human imagination is free of them
reversibility it's not a problem for the dreaming mind
it is a problem for physicists in the macro layer reality of the existence in the macro the big
do you understand what i'm saying the imagination is required to understand that reversibility
cannot be true in the physical ordinary layer right but the imagination is not subject to the law of irreversibility
in fact the imagination is naturally reversive
memory memory is in a way
reversal
what do you think
i'm trying to making sense because well as well i do consider what you were saying yes
yes yes
among the physical laws it is a general characteristic that there is reversibility in time
that is should the whole universe trace back the various positions
the bodies in it have passed through in a given interval of time
but in the reverse order to that in which these positions actually occurred
then the universe in this imaginary case would still obey the same laws i'm reading from cities
the universe yeah
see page 12 the reverse universe yeah he says at a point
the logical relationships now in the reverse universe we must suppose that all logical relations
of facts remain the same this does not imply anything concerning mental phenomena of that we shall
find out later on our investigation in fact logical relations of facts must have necessity subsist apart
apart from the question whether or not the mind exists in the universe logical relations may be said
to be simply be the most general external external facts in existence if a is b and b is c the rule then is
not that i think that aec it is a fact verifiable by observation that aec hence even should the reverse
universe destroy completely all mental phenomena logical relations must remain unchanged and consequently
also the relation of reason and consequence because he's see almost like he's locating cause causalities in
the future i don't know this just blows my mind as well i mean what he's essentially saying is that
the facts of mathematics and logic are not essentially affected by reversibility
yeah we have gone on a branch
i it's okay
that we have no problem yeah no problem yes it's like uh it's like a mission but yes we can move on i feel
like yes
yes
because i like to i like to be more but i'm not i have to recognize
oh don't worry about that that's not a thing don't worry um as well
i suspect
i suspect that death warps the circle
to create the egg
death yes
death reaches back from the future something similar right it reaches back into origin from the future
and warps the egg
say again please
the egg would be a perfect circle if there were no death and you use this word circumstance
which literally means the stance in the circle of being
the common friend circumstance yes
yes
yes
and so what you you mentioned that there's an interference there's a gravity there's a
there's something broken in
material existence but there's also some there's also i'd say more than anything uh excuse me uh
no it's okay a field of pressure
yes
yes yes or forces in
interaction forces in
pushing against each other something like that yes forces in relationship
forces in relationship
um there is something there is a flaw in physical existence
but there is also something missing in non-physical existence
and this is why there are male there are men and women
the women are like the non-physical existence and the men are much more like the physical existence
in this perspective from this perspective
we're not talking about fundamental truths we're talking about a way of seeing
the women are this is why they are mystical but they are also
it's weird like they have the sovereignty over birth and death
although in a way
i don't know what there's different ways of seeing it one can see it as the woman
is birth and the man is death but one can also see it as the woman is sovereign over both
and the man is subject to her gravity her eggs
because he comes from them he comes from her eggs
how can he be sovereign
how can he be the one who decides
he may decide in the physical but she decides in the transcendental
in this perspective that we're playing with
yes i agree
perhaps for now we shall wind down the recording
yes and i will uh reach back to you momentarily what do you think
nice this was such a conversation i'm grateful we will have another soon thanks like this yeah i'm
grateful as well beautiful brilliant let's go okay you'll hear from me shortly
thanks
thanks thanks
thanks
