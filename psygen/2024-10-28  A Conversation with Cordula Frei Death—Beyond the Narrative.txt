so i go on okay so so we we do just your recording now right yes and um
so why don't you introduce yourself and then i'll introduce myself and we'll talk a little
bit about our history i love that um so i'm this is i'm really happy to meet you here in this space
um it's been a long time and a long um yeah i can't say a friendship but a real enriching because
it is a it's more than a friendship it's a real enriching moment to see you face to face after
so much of what you've written and shared has really um yeah done shifts with me more than most
people i know so so i am here in sassen germany um it's a beautiful mild autumn evening but it's
getting dark we just had time change and already on friday it's um you know this halloween date
thinking of all the des people so you can feel outside already a little bit of this november
darkness coming and so so i'm just here in my home having taken this last sunshine in and warmth and
now at the end of the day in in this space of parallax um i host a new series which is
dealing with the roots of endivement so i hear a lot in these talks about what is endivement you know what
is um it's funny to speak about this today and then the endivement but i think that's exactly
appropriate what is the real endivement in the mechanical world and what is um
what is um that we can give by being creative within ourselves towards the world that's i guess
the space i'd like to offer and so you're my third guest and what should i say about you who doesn't
know you i i let i i have to ask you to introduce yourself in your own words but you're definitely a
person who is a master of words right you have a very specific appliance and use of language and words to
transmit something that is in living um and often it's also a little bit even beyond just the human
right if if i can say that so it's it's it's a special especially dear to me to speak to you about
that topic we chose for tonight in that manner and you're saying um you're it's a little bit difficult
for me to hear some of the words that you speak so were you saying enlightenment enlivenment enlivenment
oh it's yeah enlivenment ah to to to come to life to come back to life to be resurrected perhaps within
ourselves and our relationships and the living world yes and especially the nature is the deep
ecology i mean parallax has a very strong tradition of very strong masculine thinkers being very
philosophical so i feel um happy that andrew and tom got me in their threesome to bring in more this
feminine earthiness of um my my personal as you know me with the horses my my real embodiment of um
being in the land it's funny when you when you said the masculine and then with with your specific
accent it sounded a bit like you said phallosophical
yeah because the guys the guys can get pretty you know pretty phallosophical about things right
they're really you know they want to they want to penetrate and it's funny whereas um the women
generally right it's encompassing uh it's womb like the womb right and it's these are these are two
aspects of our potential for awareness and insight and enlivenment and it's wonderful when they mix
together and inform each other and i have a deep devotion very deep devotion my fundamental devotion is to
the feminine aspect and so um a great number of my closest friends are brilliant women around the
world and i think of them as my teachers and my mothers and my sisters and my grandmothers i'm very
very devoted in this way and even my approach to knowledge and understanding
um has a deep uh origin in my relationship to the wisdom of the women um so i'll introduce myself
briefly uh for those who don't know i use a nom de plume right and uh what do they call it um pseudopigraphy
right to to write and speak under an alternate name um and i don't usually announce that but i do i use a
nom de plume and um most of my work uh has it has an origin prior to 2002 in that i was a poet and a musician
for many many years and a writer and a bit of a performance artist a little bit and a little bit of a
comedian it's things actor a little bit but in 2002 i experienced some kind of non-ordinary event and
it lasted nine months like a gestation lasts and everything that i understood was rewritten during
that event it was i was it was like having my mind born anew and so most of my facilities with language and
knowledge and my capacity to to whatever degree i can rise above the human uh it comes from that event
but i think of myself as a cognitive activist so i'm an activist about
the features of how we think and speak and relate with language and concepts and identity
and i also like to think of myself as a bit of an intelligence artist so i'm an artist with the
the elements of our intelligence and i've been making youtube videos for maybe 10 years now and
writing voluminously that's a word um and um i just want to mention before we get started that it's my
impression my strong impression and after talking to a number of other people that impression has been
validated but there's been a continuum over time but some kind of really fundamental transformation
began around 2018 and has been proceeding and um effectively
it has radically altered what it means to be human and i think not everyone's aware of it
it we also have had covid which is kind of a red herring right if we've experienced any transformations
over this time period we're likely to pin them on that um i think that had real you know catastrophic
and profound effects but i think something else has been going on and um over the past two months
particularly it's been clear to me that whatever it is that's going on and i've spent a lot of time
looking into it has ramped up dramatically and this relates to the topic of death which i think we
will pursue so um i would love it if you would speak briefly about your relationship and work with horses
it's so funny everyone always asks me that and i always say i don't have enough time
because we want to talk about this but horses yes oh my god what should i say
well they're my why why the door that they're the doorkeeper i mean yesterday i was at the exhibition
in france and there was my beautiful dog and all these women were with my dog they said oh she's a power
animal and i said yes she is she's my companion but then the horses they're different they're so
um subtle they embody instinct and intelligence into me the most eloquent way and is so forgiving in
mistakes and readjusting at every moment to every effort we do as a human to correct our behavior and
and when you see in their physiognomity what is the word physio physiognosis
how subtle the tiniest ways of how they interact
how delicate um how delicate it is and how yeah then it just teaches me every day i'm with them how
dense we are and brutal
and clustered so when i'm with the horses they open the senses for a form of intelligence and
communication in specific that i just get a lot of um regeneration from
i deeply understand with my mind but also some of my experience of horses what shoes
they are like um if we are very dense and embodied they seem to me generally to be very spacious and
subtle orbiting a body right so like i'm really in this mass and the horses seem like the winds and the air and
the storm and the moonlight and they're only loosely in a way compared to me loosely embodied much more loosely
embodied and also you know part of the problem with humans is that we can make face noises like this
and it's very distracting so we're you know we're thinking and we're speaking whereas the horses are just
being in my experience which is very minimal compared to yours but it's something i revere and respect about
your way of being in the world your relationship with the horses and not to um not to denigrate the men
but throughout my life i've known many women who are who are bonded with the horses in an incredibly
intimate way so yeah i respect that
there is something also i must maybe add
um and i yeah i decided in all of these talks because if we talk about
um no i'm timid to say the word wrong and enlivenment right enlivenment yes
um i did talk to melvin in the other talk that if you want to be if you are enlivened in a mechanical
world you cannot but it's almost for sure you will have anxiety problems and i had to deal with them a
lot of my life and i think it's i will not make a secret out of it and if i had these anxiety moments
there was nothing but just the breath of the horse the scent of the horse and
synchronicity that happened if i would sometimes because you know i lived in wilderness pretty much
not anymore now but the last past years with them i would just go out at three in the morning
in the forest with them you know and sit on the grass and they would actually come and stand above me
like the four hoofs around me i was on the in the ground and just protect me and and i cannot
tell you what neurology that did with my brain you know immediately anchoring me in trust in security
um existential connectedness and protection of course you know in that sense yeah
beautiful i honor that how exquisite
so today we will explore death a bit yeah that's why we've um decided to have this talk
which is a little bit ironic because here we are so vitally alive and uh and yet
perhaps it is the very possibility of death that brings us to life in some way
i think the humans that seek after what they call like uh longevity or eternal life
are wildly confused about something fundamental but we could we can just explore
more openly and go wherever we want to go what um brought this topic to the forefront for you
recently well i did come across your writing about it just the other day about having recent losses in
your life and the way you describe it i thought wow this is a good moment to reconnect and share i'm in
between two funerals right now last week was the funeral of my uncle in england
which was very english and very beautiful and very traditional but still it made me very emotional
for the sake of seeing that placeholder and the big beautiful family having gone and then i come now from
six months being daily with um a person with dementia who died last monday in the final state of dementia
which was i guess the most
well the most
hard to bear
hard to bear witness death i've ever encountered
and so right now and still next week we have the funeral of this person and right now i'm in the
middle of pond on the lessons is it called all these letters coming in our house and all the people
asking did he die and how did he die um i've guarded this house after his wife died in march
so energetically a lot happened because i came into the system and then had a very beautiful time of
friendship it's like my father-in-law but yet also witnessing this incredibly subtle
um dismantling of his brain by dementia like almost like you can read it inside in a science book it
happened step for step the whole faces to the very end so i came across
um so right now i'm at the point where i'm still trying to digest the face
at the 10 minutes after life left the body
and i'm still at all when i see people moving or animals moving because then it's like almost to me
wow what is moving you you know what what is it that makes you alive because that image of him
it was i guess very um i i've seen many people deaths but not like that
that it was like
you know the mouth was still open and the eyes were looking as if the last look was still there
like really frozen in that moment of death
and something happened with me this time when i saw it something in in me just went
how should i say
maybe i've never experienced it as honestly you know not not like a shock not like oh
the dog was sick and then it had to die or my grandmother was ill and then she slowly faded
there's something that really shocked me about the body lying there and the spirit being so cut away in
that sense
it's a very powerful thing to companion with someone who is dying
i've had some small experience with it
although throughout my life
i think particularly from perhaps my 20s onward
i was deeply fascinated by death
um and i think some people perhaps thought it was a bit morbid
when i was very young i read edgar allen poe who was similarly fascinated by death
and actually um in the case of m valdemar the facts in the case of m valdemar he
they described the process of placing someone who is dying in hypnosis
so that they continue speaking through the process of their death
and this kind of thing fascinated me as a very young man
when i first came to san francisco
i was publishing a magazine called cyanosis which is a medical term meaning like the oxygen has left
your bloodstream and you're turning blue and i interviewed um at that time in the late 80s
a group of people who had become funerary activists
in the united states the funeral industry is essentially an organized crime
uh concern it's primarily owned by a single family
and the profit margin on goods and services in the funeral industry here ranges from 2500 to 15 000
so um these people uh began an art gallery
in the funeral industry where they taught people about the problems in the funeral industry
and there was a woman in in that time whose name escapes me at the moment who was campaigning
to allow people to conduct their own funerals and also to bury their dead on their land
um and one of the women who was associated with this
triumvirate uh became a crusader for uh the rights of people to care for their own dead
and conduct their own funerals and so forth and and made a significant headway here in california
the gallery back then was called guia and i ended up managing after i did the interview they invited me
to work for them and i ended up managing that gallery so i moved to san francisco and was living
in an art gallery out in the middle of nowhere filled with coffins there was a basement
underneath the the offices and the art gallery and there were 350 coffins just stacked all the way
down in this basement and um i have some unusual experiences there one of them was quite terrifying but
also very profound um so i've been deeply fascinated and perhaps
i might even say i've been having a romance with death as if she is a woman a strange woman
woman who i'm reader naturally attracted to
and that's yeah right is it collie yeah
yeah like a like a very dumb person would uh many years ago i met a man
a man who was a practitioner of bonpo tibetan uh ritual magic and a buddhist
and we were on a drive and he explained to me that he he talked about this ritual called chod
in which in the middle of the night on a certain day the practitioner takes off all of their clothes
and they get a bone flute and a skull drum and they climb up a mountain to the carnal ground
which is basically a plane on which chopped up rotting bodies are there and they they climb out there naked into the middle
of this thing and they perform this ritual in which they request to have their ego obliterated by terror
you know with by collie right coming and just shattering them with terror and he mentioned to me that um
collie's high holy day that comes only once every two thousand years was going to occur in two weeks
and like an impetuous idiot you know which is how i've led much of my life to be honest
i said do you do you know the ritual could you teach me the ritual and he said oh yeah yeah i can
teach you the ritual you know i'll send you the the chance and blah blah blah we'll do we'll go through
it so we don't have a carnal ground here but on that day i i walked to the presidio which is the last
remaining graveyard in san francisco um and when i got to the presidio there were many i didn't know
where where in the vast presidio the graveyard was i'd seen it from the freeway but i didn't really know
how to get there so i got my backpack got like my ritual stuff right i've studied the chance i'm ready to
do this and i and i walk into the presidio and i come to this field of a wide field of grass
and in the field are many skunks perhaps seven or eight of them and i notice them and one of them
turns and looks at me very intently yeah and it start it leaves the other skunks and starts walking
the way and then it turns around and looks at me again so i begin to follow it and it leads me
through the presidio about about a mile and a half right through all of these buildings and areas and
stuff right to the steps of the graveyard and up the steps of the graveyard to the gate and then it
turns around one last time and we share a glance and it departs you go in the graveyard and do the
ritual for the first time having none of the protections that would ordinarily that some
practitioner would ordinarily have right and have been given by by a by a rinpoche
um and i think that was one of the dumbest things i've ever done but also instructive
over the past few years i watched my father die of kobe within the past four weeks my very i would
say my very closest friend and someone who i think of as one of my sons an olive son ala child
was killed at an intersection in los angeles by a drunk driver who ran red light
and just a few days ago one of my best friends took his life he had been diagnosed with stage four
pancreatic and colon cancer
he was a brilliant man my friend who was killed in in los angeles went by the moniker zenith orbiting
his name was eric navarro and my friend who recently took his life who i have interviews with on my
channel was mark kevin carbon davis i mentioned their names just out of a reverence for their lives
so the death topic is certainly very present in my own heart and life and i'll stop lathering here in
just a moment but i will say that um i was shocked to learn of my friend eric's death i called his
phone his aunt answered it took her a while to figure out who i was and then she told me what
had happened and i was just devastated but that night the next morning actually as i was lying in bed
uh he showed up in my dream and he was actually joking about his death um i'll reserve what he said
out of respect for his family but he made the kinds of the kinds of jokes that he would definitely make
if we were having a phone conversation and also i can i can mention one of them without it being very
risky um he was he was kind of a foodie right so he was a tattoo artist and an artist and a musician
and he liked to build uh mechanical things like motorcycles and scooters and such and he was sort
of connected with the low rider community and um you know he would often take photographs of his meals
which is a common thing that people do these days and he said you know everything's great up here
don't don't worry about me but they don't have any restaurants there's no there's no restaurants and
you know we both laughed and just i think to reassure me that this wasn't merely my imagination when i
awoke he was still here um not in something i could see but the conversation continued it was very loving
as were all of our conversations um and although i still feel the selfish deprivation of not having him
to speak with and and live together with and bring each other back to life enliven each other they you
know like almost daily uh i felt profoundly reassured by that experience of contact
um it's so nice it's so beautiful you opened the talk for that topic because that was my
main um wish that we could speak about this um because yes i did i did think this afternoon when i was
walking about a talk i thought well yes if everyone who died there was a specific
process everyone in in my life who died and it seems that there was a specific way they reappeared
or farewelled or stayed in contact after there's specific rules and specific
matters of fact which i think after all the only question really is why am i still doubting that this is
true right you know because why shouldn't it be true and even if it wasn't true um it made sense
what happened after so
in a way
yes there is not many people i would be able to speak about this although i would think it would be
really helpful like now with the family you know it's funny what a taboo it is that i can tell
my husband and it's his father but i still feel
um
if i would be able to say with more confidence or authority this is what happened or this is what he
said or this is what they said or what i perceived i doubt that you know it's maybe just my own fantasy
or my own way of dealing with it or is it really true does it have evidence i don't know i i cannot
know but i don't care i don't need to know it's just it makes sense to have this type as you describe
the conversations that happened made sense they weren't always nice they weren't always you know
as what i imagined or wished but they made meaning
you know we we live
in a layered array of fictions as humans basically various forms of lying
right and so if one of us brings some if we bring something to the common people
and it violates their fictions then mostly we get punished or you know isolated or laughed at or
you know people make jokes or whatever um but the fact that that the vast
i mean we have to be careful too because as humans we have we are especially as moderns we
have this um we have a variety of foibles and one of them is to take the worst common denominator and
say well this is how people are people do this the people do people blah blah blah people don't listen
to things about death and contact with um people who are who have left their bodies or are gone
uh but actually in in any
in any in any group of people where we have the agreement to see and learn together
we don't have to worry about those fictions
right it's just if we're with the common people in a regular everyday context
at the grocery store at work at the church where the funeral is happening you know in one of these
everyday contexts they may be unfriendly to something that um gives the lie to the ridiculous
suppositions under which they are all operating and you know we can i have some respect for that you
know i have a have something i say which is that related to that which is just that
i try not to take off enough of my costume to scare the natives
right so when i'm with them i'll pretend that they're ridiculous fictions make sense
sense we can talk about whatever they're talking about and i'll just be with them as a human being
um but yeah i get it it is weird and what you were saying is like if there were protocols if there
were rituals then let's be very clear probably for most of human history for the vast majority of
human history there were right um however there are different styles right of dealing with
dead i know um that my friend ryan heavyhead or actually ryan first diver now when he talks to me
about blackfoot culture um the dead are not to be related with you leave that completely alone when
someone dies you take all of their belongings all of them without exception out into a field and you burn
them right and in their tradition death is seen as the end of that person there's nothing after there's
no before life there's no discussion of afterlife they're really not metaphysical metaphysically
minded in that sense traditionally um and it's they think of the dead people as dusts and those dusts
are to be avoided generally from what i understand and my understanding is very minimal but then you
have other cultures where the skeletons of mom and dad are in a specific room over there we feed them
before we feed ourselves right african yeah yeah i thought about that too and you know the thing is um
um well first of all i don't think as individual as we are as individual is that there's the the person
i wouldn't say the best person the person who has shifted identity might not want to be in contact
in my experience and some do and some want to for too long and some don't want at all so there is no
rule in my that's for me the first mistake is that the religions try to say it's like this or that so
second second problem is that we hold on to the person as we know the person to be
which i see as the first predicament why many people don't have these conversations with the person
transcending or transmuting because they hold on as you mentioned before in their
understandable ego to the memory of that person whereas my first teaching with communicating with
people who transcended or left their body was that it very quickly changed very quickly changed their
look very quickly changed the personality um i still knew it was my grandmother or my best girlfriend
who died when she was 34 or whoever but my job on my end was to let go of the memory by holding on to
certain imagery because then they would fade um or the contact would just break away or at certain times
i knew this was just the last time i dreamt of them i i saw them i got a message but if i if i really
opened up to the possibility that they that they are profoundly changing in whatever imagination i could
possibly have um the contact stayed quite open and there was moments like with my grandmother who was
very very dear to me um after she had died i had to basically even tell her after three days
um you're dead you have to go now you know you're walking around the house and in my life and in my
kitchen with my little kid siblings i said it's it really starts annoying me i mean i love this woman
so much but she didn't understand she was dead and she was still there doing things you know energetically
she would speak to me and i really told her you've got to go you know so in that that tradition you just
spoke of made complete sense with her um another this this best friend i talked about she seemed for
three years to be stuck in a world in between and she reappeared always in that same little hut down
the river in the world between the worlds in the same scenario to the point where when i dreamt it
or revisited or revisited it i really couldn't bear it anymore you know i would repeatedly try to tell her
this is this yes we are all coming and visiting you but it's not as she held on to that um
she held on to this reality that she created like in that other world in between
but at one point it wasn't nice anymore to visit her you know at one point it was terrible it was like
um yeah i told her i'm not going to come anymore it's if you don't understand that that you were
stuck somewhere in between and you don't want to let go i'm i'm not going to come anymore
you know so with everyone who died and also with the ones who came and haven't been born yet like
the children uh i think it's as individual
as that no religion for any of these specific
mysteries would have the one and simple answer right
um okay there's so much to cover there so
it long ago occurred to me that the humans and i often speak of them as as though i don't belong to
their species because i'm whatever i might be i can't be merely human and if we even think
rationally about it first we are a being then we are an organism then we are an animal then we are a
human then we are a thinking part right so the thinking part has to be like and the human part is
very small right we think no no i'm a human that's everything about what i am it is not that's not what's
going on on certain of it forgive me for being declarative but so yeah the humans like to propose
a picture of what happens after death right especially the religions and the religions that
are really old like the hindu religions for example they're probably not too far off you know but it
should be really obvious to anyone who's thinking about it that dying has got to be pretty similar
to being born right and the fact that you're born means you're going to have a very unique
personal experience that has some things in common with everyone who's born but is also almost like
you're the only person who was ever born right it's so unique right that it's you're the only one right
so i think we should take this very seriously if we want to be thinking about death and i'm just going
to say something ridiculous for a moment that i've recently come to understand i don't think minds they are
not for thinking right thinking for a mind is like being nailed to a rock for a bird thinking is what
happens when humans are isolated it's a symptom of isolation now what minds are actually for are what
you were doing with the horse out in the field minds are for communion they are for being together
intimately in awareness and in consciousness they are not for thinking thinking is like yeah it's a
really not the right thing to be doing most of the time even though i'm doing some here um so yeah
whatever death might be i suspect i have reason to suspect that it's very similar to being born right
it's got to be pretty unique for each person and there's a vast continuum of possibilities
right that get that that are somehow localized into a specific death um just in the same way that
every flower is a unique flower in a very unique place on the earth at a very unique time in the
earth's history and so forth right um and then i i loved what you said about the expectation of continuity
of identity right which i'm i'm putting in my own words right the person dies and we think like we
have these pictures of them in our mind and we go looking for the behind the photos the things to
remind us yeah and you know i was reminded just of an analogy and forgive me if it's a little bit
if it's a little common but imagine that i'm madly in love with a caterpillar right but i'm naive
naive i'm naive so every day i go into the room and my caterpillar's there and i bring it grape leaves
and it's so happy it eats the leaves it's all pretty it's got all these colors and stuff and then one day
i go into the room and the caterpillar is gone and there's this weird object what the hell is that
right where is my caterpillar they said something stole it it's only come and ate it in the night
and now there's this weird thing what the hell is that right and then then a few days later the
butterfly emerges and i'm like i don't want a butterfly i want my caterpillar back you know
yeah but i mean even you know that's a beautiful example because as a mother of three children i would
even feel like that in the time of them growing up you know i mean my god how they changed and then there
were so many of these moments where i had to let go of the sweet or not so sweet transition phase that
in that strong connection you have as mother and children but they would change in front of my eyes
eyes i mean even today i saw my youngest son shortly and i looked at him and i thought oh my god he looks
so different again is this my son and at times i made it a practice to even look at them as bestranged
you know like as to to look at them as not my child and product or whatever but to really
um look at them like as someone in the street you know and allow myself what types of feeling would
i develop if i would see them in a crowd or in a family meeting even it doesn't matter
so so that that thing of the caterpillar that this is happening in truth i guess i mean even now we are
changing every minute we are changing you and i was as we talked we already now 52 minutes
older so are we are we closer to death has 52 minutes of our lifespan been used now so you know
by the way if i have anxiety attacks it's a lot of that you know it's a lot of that feeling um
that i that i um that the time in this world is threatening me just that you know the time that
i have to get up in the morning this has to be done the time is ticking it's going on it's going on
i can't stop it i can't make it backwards i can't like with the feeling with the horses being
multi-dimensional there is the certain narrative everything proceeds next birthday next morning next
autumn next evening so in a way that's all leaving the skin of the caterpillar behind every minute if
we're truthful right so wouldn't that be amazingly regenerating if we could embrace that
the time the time question is very profound and yes i feel the same stress um in fact
it turns out that if we look very carefully and we're trying to understand the nature of being
we will ask very unusual questions about time
because the concept of linear time as we experience it as moderns and as humans and you can see over the
the span of the development of the evolution of human uh cognition and consciousness what you see
is this very strange transformation of the concept of time from an intimately relational
thing to a bunch of slices in a row and that slicing up thing is evidence of i think something very
dangerous and toxic to our spirit and our heart and our sense of well-being um
you know i was reminded when you were talking about your children changing
of something that i still kind of resent which is that i remember one day
i went in the bathroom and i looked in the mirror and i was dumbfounded
because it was no longer my face i have my own face and this is not it this is my dad's face
this is my father's face and i went from having my own face to suddenly now i have my father's
face and i'm very upset about this just like the caterpillar and i'm like i want my own face back
right why do i have to look like my dad he was okay looking guy you know but i want my face back um
so yeah we we do we do transform and there's this idea that i think is very confused which is similar to
what you're saying about our expectations of those who who have passed away or whatever which is that um
um we are trained to think that i am the one me who did previously done things right so that all the
things i've ever done i did even if i was three or seven or 12 or whatever which okay i get the idea but
it's not true okay i understand and there's this whole weird courtroom mind thing which is associated
with the death topic right because even if you listen to people who've had near-death experiences
and i used to go to um ian's meetings here in the bay area in berkeley the international association of
near-death studies and what you'd hear it's sort of like an alcoholic anonymous meeting right someone
gets up and they talk about their alcoholism except they get up and they talk about they died and what
happened and there is a common thread in those stories it's not the only one and there's stories
that don't have it right but it's a thread of having been having to be shown and witnessing um
your actions and words that cause other people to be to feel hurt right and just having to go through
this and how devastating it is over and over again right you have to just go through it and go through
it and go through in some stories right not all of them but it's a common thread so yeah we have this uh
accounting idea right but and you know the ancient greeks actually that's not true some ancient greeks
uh lived and underwent initiations um to uh surpass the problem of enacting unjust things while you're
alive and thus escape the birth-death cycle but also to be lifted above human birth to see what the whole
thing is about so that you could come back down into the body with your passions under the aegis or the
the instruction of the virtues right so you can no longer be um you can no longer be seduced by desire
right you can no longer be seduced by desire or anger or passion because now the virtues uh directly inform
your moment to moment being as a human which is a truly profound and amazing uh perspective
that's in grace right you're talking about grace yes i'm yes i'm specifically talking about the eleusinian
mysteries and i had recently um become acquainted with a woman i think her name is maria mariku and she
initiates people into the mystery traditions in greece i'm hoping to do an interview with her sometime
soon um it's interesting because i yesterday i met a woman um at the art gallery did not do anything here
now she just told me she's on a trip on she was a healer she talked to me in the street next to my
car and she was saying she's going to greece um to do some kind of rituals in in that in that aspect and
then i laughed and i said to her well yes i i understand because when i've been to greece and i
really want to go back even maybe perhaps if possible in two or three weeks because when i was in greece
and i was only the last two years i went there for the first time fully not just as a tourist in a
you know one week flight hotel and back um i i traveled around mount atos
and it was very strange how people how should i say they had some kind of adoration
uh respect adoration a kind of attitude towards me or others which was completely unknown to me
so i asked someone and several people there about it you know um and it was made understand understood to
me that um in the archaic collective in a gesture it's still for them possible that everyone they
meet or their approach um is a chance every encounter is a chance to make it good right to
to put another word in english and that was it was so beautiful to feel because it wasn't like in the
when you go to india or to thailand or bali it wasn't this um well i do it i do the rituals in case of
you know i do them every sunday and i do them every night just so my sins are forgiven and it it wasn't
also in after you know after something bad happened and you just do some
remedying um ceremonies but there in greece i felt as if they virtually you know like a fisherman i give
you an example a fisherman did his fishing and i was sitting there and he would come to the shore
and then pick one of his nicest fishes and offer it to me so at the beginning i didn't
know why you know and it wasn't this woman manzing at all or it wasn't because i was a tourist i could
feel it was a gesture which we are lacking here in germany or switzerland it was a gesture
acknowledging and livement i guess an interconnection and communion you know as i brought these fishes out
of the water and of and it was making him happy or her to share that as plenty you know bringing plenty to
not just my own harvest so there was very something very specific in in greece in the greek people i i
came across so so i my ears went like this when you were speaking now but i didn't know about i don't
know much about their mythology or their um religious um rituals nowadays i guess it's it's pretty orthodox
right the modern kind of i'm not sure um my friend sarah james uh on facebook um i've got an interview
with her on my channel as well she's the one who introduced me to maria and uh be prior to becoming
more uh in closer contact with her um i came across a maniac a madman who studies ancient greek
um and he's become modestly famous lately and i i think it's briefly related but i won't i won't
linger on the topic but his name is almond hillman and i've made some videos and written an essay about
him um and with with some luck perhaps i'll get an interview with him but um
i'm sure that the greeks are like us um there are moderns who do the things you were talking
about right like they do a little ritual to try to um remediate their wrongdoing you know or they
they do a little ritual in in case they need protection you know later or or you know something
like this but then just like us too there are there are plagues of them there are groups of them
um specific groups who uh sustain the ancient traditions i think in a very deep way um sarah
is a british woman but maria is a greek woman and maria's knowledge of the elicinian mysteries which
involve essentially the whole like christian death and resurrection thing was stolen from the greeks
but it wasn't supposed to happen when you're dead it's supposed to happen while you're alive
right similarly in enlightenment right you're supposed to die to the ego while you're alive
and thus be born again right so the greeks um some of the greeks the ones who are practitioners of the
mystery traditions they were very aware of this uh in a very complicated way um and there are still
among them people who are like this i think you know there are cultures in which the old traditions
are alive in a in a large number of the people like the man who brings you the fish for example
there's just a there's a tradition and and look i have something of that tradition in me
we all have this something of it in us right we want to bring each other back to life
right teach other spirits while we're alive right we don't have to wait till you're dead
and many of us are walking around dead inside anyway so you know what is death going to be it's
not going to be dead it's going to be the death of the dead thing we had become right and then
a couple of other things i want to mention one of them is um
organisms invented death on purpose it's not a problem it's a right it's a solution and it's a
solution to having a body that was born for a world that no longer exists so you need to have a body
that's born for the world that exists now now that's presuming that we're actually separate souls
which i'm not so sure about that i'm not so sure we even have separate minds i think we have the
appearance of separate minds when we are isolated and we do a lot of thinking and the guys do a lot of
talking i mean maybe the girls do too i won't speak for them but um so you know i think there is i'm
nearly certain that this one i'm still frightened of death that's scary it scares me and i've been
intimate with it throughout my life um but it still scares me uh but um i think we've really got it
backwards in the way we think about it and it occurred to me a few weeks ago in a conversation
that perhaps perhaps this being that we might refer to as god and i don't mean like the religious god
i mean the being who is the sum of unity and who's the light of whose being shines into us and moves us
around and is the light inside our minds and this kind of thing and it doesn't have to be thought of
as a man or it can be thought of as a man inside a woman and the woman is like pure undifferentiated
potential and the man you know differentiates that potential and she becomes beings and stuff
there's lots of different ways to think about it but if if god has these sort of rays
rays like the sun has rays and one of those rays goes to sleep right and it wakes up in a human body
and has this life right which is like the peace of god the aspect of god is having a dream
and it's having a dream from which it can look back upon its own being and relate with it from outside
and it's also having a dream in which it can relate with all the other dreaming aspects of it
in the living world maybe in all the worlds but certainly on this one and then so it's it's dreaming
but it's very it's a very profound kind of dream because it's a physical dream right it physicalizes
becomes matter and stuff and then when we die that aspect is resurrected
with all of the memories of the dreaming
and so you know i think that actually getting born is more of a problem than death is i think
you know like we probably have this backwards we think like cling to life at all costs hold on
tightly you know keep that little thing going and that's okay too i'm not you know of course we
we survival is you know it matters and taking care of the body and each other and the world and all
those things they matter they're really important but um i think our fears and stuff we might have this
backwards wildly backwards like inside out
so yeah i i also made a recording about this as well it's called death i think we might have this
backwards but yeah this this idea i find very profound and i'm not posing it to say like here's
what i think is going on let me be really quick about one thing whatever's going on
your chances of thinking it are zero whatever's going on is so explosively impossibly ecstatic
that i think if we were to get even a reasonable glimpse of it we would die of ecstasy on the spot
right and people go around thinking like well i know what's going on you know blah blah blah yeah
good for you he's like you got these thinking things going good good for you that has little
to do with whatever is actually happening because whenever i've had a glimpse of what you know what's
going on it's not a thinkable thing and it's so ecstatically beautiful that if i were to see much
more of it i would expire of beauty on the spot
i think this is a perfect closing um word for that first talk and i i'm i'm sure we both feel we
just tapped onto the surface and i could go on forever and i hope we can in that some days
and possibly in one of a course also with people engaging in dialogue or some practices but um
um but to just a finishing word from my side to what you just said is um what i really appreciated
about sri arobindo's um writings and the mothers especially um era alphasas was how he always
pronounced very specifically that we are not finished we are a being in becoming
in an evolutionary um way that you know i used to say that in the time i was very engaged with that
sort i used to say to friends maybe we're gonna have notes like this or maybe we're gonna have
you know it was helpful for me to think this is not the finished product
and wherever it's gonna go i have to die for that to happen so that the cells can transmute and
reorganize themselves and form new species and and being part of that is is exciting right it's just
not exciting if you fear to lose that which we hold on to as that what we got used to so
another another friend asked me one day what is my spiritual practice and amongst many i said you know
the one i appreciate the most is the one from rudolf steiner um forgetting that every night you purposely
invite yourself to forget everything that you think you know and wake up with the innocence of not
knowing you know my kids they they would now scream and say yes sometimes they can't stand it they
look at me and say mom how could you have forgotten this and this and this but i told you that and
then still why can i operate in this world and why can i drive a car and why am i actually always punctual
you know they notice that but they also notice that a lot of stuff my brain doesn't um load down
anymore it's like the what do you call it the hardware doesn't keep it you know it goes in but
it's immediately processed and that to me is a is a feeling if you could say i would privately have a
religious practice to prepare for this then that would be the one so to allow myself to even
forget my identity or name or age or place i live at certain times yeah in deep meditation moments i come
back and then i basically have to re recollect the pieces of oh it's summer or and oh now it's autumn i'm
here it's morning this is my name this is what i'm out to do but that comes very close to feeling ecstatic
if it is a feeling that goes through the day or through the night meets with other people and
stays fluid in it you know without having an anxiety attack about it which can also happen
because you can go to the supermarket in that state and just feel i don't don't understand how to
use my card and how to pay and what this little sign here means is this to eat oh okay i feel like
that sometimes the complexity of going to a supermarket is too much for me sometimes
yes i mean
there was never a thing like a supermarket in most of human history i don't think we were
evolved to be able to cope with nine billion products the catastrophic over choice of representations
right it's a kind of a hell for for our our our embodied aspect of being alive like what
this got what what is this you know and then the light and the sound and um the the way everything is
packed up if you can't smell you know that's one thing in greece also i don't know if it's in
all places of greece but where i was at the beginning i saw the supermarket were closed
until i realized no that's just all they have and all they have was a couple of grains potatoes onions
tomatoes maybe zucchini uh some fish and meat but there was no choices there was just a one product
you know there wasn't four oranges there was five kinds of goat's cheese there was just a one
and it felt so yeah that was so relaxing in that sense you know it just reminded me again
to greece so we have to explore a little bit more i will go through i will go through this um ritual of
um farewelling or what what we want to call it um the article we say in german funeral i will go next week
and then i i'd love to tell you a little more how how the whole family you know is engaged right
now in not doing it like the church and not doing it like the village coming in communication in what
is it actually that we feel is appropriate and then there's the hardships legally there's all these rules
you have to it's almost impossible to do a fairwelling ceremony the way we feel it's right
so i very quickly yesterday got my kids together and said here's my testament make sure this and
this and this i want to happen and they looked at me said why and i said because i realized now it's
going to be really hard to make this happen yeah i'm gonna have to fight for this you know can't take
here you can't take the ashes home you can't in germany you can't put the ashes in the forest or
plant a tree or in switzerland you can but not in germany you have to wait a certain amount of time
until the body is burned which i also feel is very unnatural so it's lying for maybe six weeks in the
freezer and all stuff like that you know and you can say it's it's just the body no but it's an
information in that body and and so i i care that's the only thing i can do right now is to visualize
my own ceremony how i want it and then just live with that in my heart and kind of try to live it
every day not to the moment when i die but to you know what i mean yes yes it's beautiful
so i'm a little bit unsatisfied we didn't cover all of that complexity but that would have been crazy
but i so much enjoyed hearing you there were some sentences you said and moments which i will
like always when you do your writings also which i will think about for the coming time
and yours as well and we can certainly do this again we could even meet regularly if we like but
i would very much enjoy a part two where we go a little deeper into death and you know parts of
our experience and concern and thought about it and how and how we you know how our our quote
cultures unquote which mostly aren't cultures um orbit you know orbit this mystery yeah i would love it
so we don't have we have to maybe stop here for today but not not for tomorrow wonderful thank you so i wish
you a beautiful day on your end um for here you can see it's turning night yeah may you have a beautiful
night and amazing dreams and much love much love thank you bye bye for now
