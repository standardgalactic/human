I don't want to set the world on fire, I just want to start a flame in your heart.
So the question of are there bad beings had come up, and I think it's very interesting, and I'm not saying there aren't bad beings.
However, there's some things we need to know, I think we need to pay attention to about the nature of human cognition.
And one of them is that if you compromise a root element in human cognition, you fuck everything up,
and you can't tell you've done this because nobody's looking at the structure of the root elements, which I call holophores.
And one of the root elements is the good-evil dichotomy.
So if, for example, one thinks that snakes are evil, snakes are bad, okay, well, I mean, you've just fucked up one of the fundamental symbols in the holophores lexicon.
And at the same time, you've messed up the entire animal kingdom, right?
Because now there's a bad thing in the animal kingdom.
And there's certain moves you can make in cognition that just make it impossible for you to make a good move in the future,
like a move that actually works or is useful or doesn't fuck you up.
And one of the problems, we should be really clear about this, I think.
My friend was laughing at me because he's like, yeah, you always say that, Darren.
Let's get clear about something.
But I think we should be really clear about one of the fundamental problems, which is,
what was the issue in the Garden of Eden at the tree incident,
presuming that there's some meaningful information we can glean there, okay?
And what the issue actually was, according to the shitty translations we have of a book that was probably stolen,
was, quote, the knowledge of good and evil.
And it might be a problem for humans to think this way.
Because I think it fucks up something fundamental in the root of mind and identity itself.
And so one of the things I suggested to my friend was that they not think in terms of demons or angels,
but rather in terms of the presence or absence of good.
So that the idea of demons is not actually about entities, per se, though it could be.
There's different purposes for which we can pursue these questions.
But rather, most of the problems in our life, we pose them as the presence of a problem,
but they're often the absence of a solution.
And humans get very confused between presence and absence.
They can think that things that are missing are things.
It's sort of the same problem you have with a shadow, right?
You're walking down the street, you see your shadow.
Is the shadow a thing?
Or is it the absence of something?
And what I was arguing to my friend was that it's particularly because this friend has a problem
with thinking about entities that are bad a lot too much.
I was like, why don't you pose them in your mind, not as something that's there,
but as something that's missing.
Like those key features of the brightness of being that have gone missing.
And that produces the impression of the presence of something, but it's actually the absence.
And this is something Toymaker pointed out to me.
He's like, yeah, you guys think about, I mean, he didn't say things, but he encouraged me to think about evil,
not as the presence of something, but as the absence of the intelligence of the divine.
I think that's so beautiful.
Can I, can I provide an anecdote that will kind of, we can tie what you sang into it.
So my friend recently just shared with me, you know, there's always, there's always an interesting moment when you've been friends with someone and it feels like you're like,
you've had this certain level of relationship and then you like something happens and you come out to each other and you're like,
Oh yes, I do believe in all these things that most people don't talk about.
Oh yeah. You too. Great.
Now we can have more in depth conversation.
And so I had a moment like that with a friend recently and he shared with me,
he's had multiple deaths on the property that he lives in.
Um, one person was shot and like, and then another person, actually two people were shot, um, around his house.
And he, he says he doesn't know, he didn't like hear this.
He wasn't taught this, but he just kind of had this realization of like, Oh, like these people need to be told that it's okay.
Like that they can move on from life.
Um, and he went out there with a candle and would walk around until he found a white owl.
And that's how he knew that it was them. And he basically was like, Hey, like, Hey, like, I know you and I didn't always get along, but like, um, it's okay.
Like you can go. Um, and the owl flew away and he said, he felt like that was the thing.
And I guess it's not super important to figure out like what, what that is.
Um, was it actually his friend? Was it his way of grieving? Like, I don't know if through our discussion, we can figure out exactly what happened, especially since we weren't there.
We're not, but that sort of like the presence of spirits, souls, whatever.
Um, once they leave their bodies and then when people talk about demons, which sounds kind of like, like the absence of something, like not actually some like malicious input that's invisible and fucking things up.
Although those could exist. Um, you know, there's that interplay of like, there are shadows that we can assume that are things.
And then there's also like beings that are invisible or, you know, on another realm.
And I, and I'm curious what you have to say about that.
There's so many interesting features here to me. I've recently been reading, just kind of weird for me to be reading things.
Um, I'm in the situation I'm in, um, I've been reading this book called philosophy and the evolution of consciousness.
Owen Barfield saving the appearances. This one of my saving the appearances is one of my very favorite books. Um, just love that thing.
It's so brilliantly great. And I definitely encourage you both to read it and anyone who's listening to read it. Um, but it starts out with, you know, what is the rainbow?
And I'm going to go on a bit of a, I'm going to do a little dissertation here. Feel free to interrupt me, ask questions, slap me around, whatever feels right.
Right. Um, but, uh, I think one of the most overlooked problems in human cognition orbits one of the seven question words, which is, I'll just mention the words case. They're not obvious.
Um, what, who, why, where, when, which, and how.
Okay. Now this word, what is usually the gravestone of intelligence.
And we think we're really smart when we figure out what something is.
Um, let's be absolutely clear about, about this.
Uh, if you're talking about a fork,
it works, it's functional at the level of very simple, pragmatic, like it has a useful scope, like science does. Science has a useful scope.
The problem is when we take the principles from the useful scope and we transfer them onto all other phenomena.
So let me ask you a question. Have you ever seen a dust devil?
Are those, those like, like little mini tornadoes?
Yep.
Yeah.
You're walking down the street and you see like some leaves and detritus and dirt and stuff, and it's kind of spinning around.
Um, and you know that there's a dust devil there, but let me ask you a couple questions.
Is it a thing?
I mean, is it a thing the way a fork is a thing?
What the fuck actually is that?
Because it's not there.
It is there. I'm looking at the scientific definition in the dictionary of encyclopedias.
And then it says that a dust devil is defined by the area of three millimeters beyond the perceived dust particle that is on the outmost tornado of the dust devil.
That is word for word.
Okay.
You, you are, you are, um, dude, you are broken and you're broken in all the ways that I love best.
But your mind is broken because you actually said that you were reading in the dictionary of encyclopedias.
You actually said that dude, it's recorded.
We can go back and listen.
The dictionary of encyclopedias.
And I just want to emphasize the, the dick part of that statement.
Yeah.
Well, you, you told me that I was allowed to punch you and push you around.
That's true.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Dictionary of encyclopedias.
That's a book that I want.
If you find that thing, send me a copy right now, brah.
Love it.
Yeah.
Fantastic.
Oh God.
It's on the way.
So yeah, like, is there a dust devil?
And you can say by extension, well, tornadoes, right?
Or whirlpools in water.
But what are they?
Are they there?
I mean, Barfield's much more brilliant.
He just goes right to the rainbow.
Because think carefully about what is a rainbow.
Sorry for the motor.
By the way, just please be safe, whatever you're doing.
Sitting in a car in a parking lot.
Okay, good.
So we transfer this concept of, what is it?
Is the word quiddity?
Let me look here.
Yeah.
Quiddity.
Yeah.
We transfer the concept of quiddity from, I'm making some notes here.
We transfer that on the phenomena.
And we also make another big mistake.
And remember the topic here.
We're talking about the nature of the idea of whatness in human cognition and human thinking and speech.
So, like, I know, for example, I feel that I know that, I don't know, this, this, you know, 147 pound desk that I'm tapping on right now.
It's not going to move.
When I go to sleep, it's there.
When I wake up, it's there.
It's solid.
It's continuous.
It's always there.
I know it's there.
It's a desk.
I know what it is.
When I say this desk, I know what I'm referring to.
It's continuous in time and space.
It's shape doesn't change.
It's concrete.
It's relatively concrete.
And for that scope, it works.
Okay.
But we transfer that expectation of static quiddity onto all phenomena in thought.
And, and once you do that, your, your mind starts attacking its own root because there can't be anything like that.
There isn't anything like that.
It's impossible and you're certain that it's true and reliable.
You know, there are the, the Zen koans that I think are really interesting, particularly the one because it has this double valence in this topic of what is the sound of one hand clapping, right?
What actually is the sound of one hand attempting to clap against its own fucking absence?
Right.
Um, so there's also the, the idea that, that if you were trying to clap with one hand, it would actually make a sound like what, what, what, what, what, what, right?
Um, so what I'm getting out here, haha, what I'm getting at hilarious, uh, is what something is when we try to derive identity, um, from phenomena, I think we really get fucked up.
Um, because there's, what happens is we're collapsing the manifold of identity in a way that we're familiar with and we were trained to do it.
Everyone around us does it all the time.
All the time.
Um, and wow, it's a huge mistake again, totally useful for small pragmatic things.
It has a useful scope of application, but like science, when it escapes that useful scope and starts making broad declarations about the nature of reality or, you know, what humans are or what that girl.
What that girl just did.
Imagine that someone commits an action, right?
If it's a very simple action, Tina picked up a fork.
There's not really any problem.
Um, but if, if the action was relational, there's no chance of you figuring out what Tina did.
Forget it.
It's not possible.
it's just, there's just no way it's gonna happen.
well how does the rainbow exemplify that situation according to barfield okay so let's get some
fucking barfield going on here since uh i've got the book right here even though it's shredded and
thoroughly marked up by someone i never met i've ordered a new copy but it just hasn't arrived yet
let's start with the first paragraph look at a rainbow while it lasts it is or appears to be
a great arc of many colors occupying a position out there in space it touches the horizon between
that chimney and that tree a line drawn from the sun behind you and passing through your head
would pierce the center of the circle of which it is apart and now before it fades
recollect all you have ever been told about the rainbow and its causes and ask yourself the
question is it really there you know from memory that if there were a hillside three or four miles
nearer than the present horizon the rainbow would come to earth in front of and not behind it that
if you walk to the place where the rainbow ends or seems to end it would certainly not be there
in a word reflection will assure you that the rainbow is the outcome of the sun the raindrops and
your own vision when i ask of an intangible appearance or representation is it really there
i usually mean no excuse me i usually mean is it there independently of my vision would it be there
for instance if i shut my eyes if i move towards or away from it if this is what you also mean by really
there you will be tempted to add that the raindrops and the sun are really there but the rainbow is not
does it follow that as soon as anybody sees a rainbow there is one or in other words that there
is no difference between an hallucination or a madman's dream of a rainbow perhaps on a clear day
and an actual rainbow certainly not you were not the only one to see that rainbow you had a friend
with you i forbear asking if you both saw the same rainbow because this is a book about history
rather than metaphysics and these introductory chapters are merely intended to clear away certain
misconceptions moreover through the medium of language you are well aware that thousands of others
have seen rainbows in showery weather but you have never heard of any sane person claiming to have
seen one on a sunless or cloudless day therefore if a man tells you he sees a rainbow on a
cloudless day then even if you are convinced that he means what he says and is not simply lying
you will confidently affirm that the rainbow he sees is not there
now look at a tree it is very different from a rainbow if you approach it it will still be
there moreover in this case you can do more than look at it you can hear the noise its leaves make
in the wind you can perhaps smell it you can certainly touch it your senses combine to assure
you that it is composed of what is called solid matter accord to the tree the same treatment that
you accorded to the rainbow recollect all you have been told about matter and its ultimate structure and
ask yourself if the tree is really there i am far from affirming dogmatically that the atoms electrons nuclei
etc of which would and all matter is said to be composed are particular and identifiable objects
like drops of rain but if the particles as i will here call them for convenience are there and are all
that is there then since the particles are no more like the thing i call a tree
then the raindrops are like the thing i call a rainbow it follows i think that just as a rainbow
is the outcome of the raindrops in my vision so a tree is the outcome of the particles in my vision
and my other sense perceptions whatever the particles themselves may be thought to be the tree
a tree as such is a representation and the difference for me between a tree and a complete hallucination
of a tree is the same as the difference between a rainbow and a hallucination of a rainbow in other
words a tree which is really there is a collective representation the fact that a dream tree differs in
kind from a real tree and that it is just silly to try and mix them up is indeed rather literally a matter of
common sense this background of particles is of course presumed in the case of raindrops themselves
no less than in that of trees the relation raindrops colon rainbow is a picture or analogy not an
instance of the relation particles colon representation all right that's one of the most brilliant
things i've ever read in my life those few sentences that is incredibly
powerful it might as well be that a god just came down from heaven and tapped me on the head and went
hey buddy wake the up bro check this out think about a rainbow think about a tree right because
you totally trust that the tree is there he's telling you it isn't
is somebody finger drumming yeah sorry i was driving the whole time that you're talking all right so
now i want to ask you something
how much less real and once again i want to be really clear i'm not saying there's no such thing
as demons but where is the demon right just like where is the rainbow where is the angel where is the
demon and i think we can point at this where and it is in the between of existence awareness
bodies and thought that's where it is
but the demon is much less real than the rainbow and i'm not saying there aren't spirits of the dead
in fact personally i'm rather convinced there are but we should be really careful about how we speak
about them and how we think about their liquidity right this is super important if we want
to be intelligent if we want to have the opportunity to be intelligent together or even by ourselves
the humans get really confused about this word what and they think that things actually are the
things that they say they are when they say that is a x there is no chance that things are that even
with the fork right even if i'm holding a metal fork in my hand it fails the scope of it is useful
we all know what i mean by a fork
i can locate it in space and time i can weigh it with instruments i can you know x-ray it and
do all kinds of crazy things with with anything i want that will convince me that the on the continuum
of existence the fork is very close to concrete the rainbow not so much the tree less than a fork because
the interesting qualities of a fork are conceivably limited to seven thousand the interesting qualities of
a tree are certainly infinite the interesting qualities of a rainbow we can't even begin we're
fucked is it even there i can't tell if it's there it's not there if i'm not here
so this quiddity question becomes really fundamental to human cognition what is something i mean that's not
liquidity i don't know what it is it's um identity right particularly in language and concept
well the rainbow is you in a certain sense uh like a sunset so the question is where or what is
the sunset you can understand that question by analogy with the question you know what is the rainbow
you know because in a certain sense the sunset is you so i mean does that does that brooch
what you mean by identity okay so this brings up something really trippy um it does and well done
george as always um this brings up something really really trippy which is where are
where are the things we perceive because they are not in the world
there is no me perceiving that can be found in the world
it's it's some kind of a mirror game right awareness is some kind of a amazingly sophisticated
mirror right and i would argue that the mirror
my verge my
my instance of the mirror is localized in my what we call consciousness except the container metaphor
is wrong it's not unique right it's not like i have this you know bag called consciousness and
there's things in there but we speak this way in english because the container metaphor pervades over
english in english in a strange way thanks to what's his name who wrote that book on metaphors we live by
george lakehoff
damn you
you know one of the things we do together is that we um we act as elements in a memory array
that re-member together better than we can member apart
that was a beautiful demonstration of the fact that our minds aren't separate and when we're talking
the mirrors reflect off each other and if you have the referent that i'm missing you will naturally
playfully joyfully supply it and then we both get a little hit of dopamine and we can you know we can
get rid of social media are you referencing metaphors we live by i was lakehoff and johnson
that book sat that book lived in my car and i i never opened it but it was a constant like object
for me to meditate on of metaphors we live by it's sitting in my childhood bedroom at the moment i should
really crack that open but it's like a series of essays isn't it yeah but they're really powerful
right relationships are a journey aha and by the way you straight up just said that book lives in my car
right so you use you straight up container metaphored it as best as you possibly could
which was you know brilliant let's not lose the thread here whatness so where is whatness right whatness
is not in things the way that language teaches us to expect suppose declare argue over whatness is not
in things in fact what i think you will find most often not always if we go looking for where whatness is
what we will discover and this is one of the things that reforged my mind when toymaker was with me
is that toymaker showed me not told me showed me how
the seven question words with the possible exception of the last one i usually put it last sometimes first
how um those things don't tell us anything about existence what they tell us if we look carefully and
intelligently with them and there's one of them with or no that's not oh wow well that's not a question
it's a conjunction with if we look carefully and intelligently with those what we discover
is that the question words don't tell us about existence they tell us about our purpose in making
derivations over it and that res the resulting thing from when we make a declaration of identity
is not a derivation of identity it's a derivation of purpose in analysis
purpose in speech why we are speaking why we are thinking why we are asking
the purpose determines the children of awareness and this is what i was going to say earlier
when we derive something in consciousness we are giving birth we become pregnant with purpose
the purpose the purpose undergoes an embryogenic process and what we emit is the result
of having had sex with awareness and phenomena in consciousness that is a rainbow that is the child
of my purpose the rainbow is not there what is there is in awareness the child of my purpose
has been born and in my statement or assertion i reify it this is the key to human cognition this one
thing this is the treasure a billion souls have lived and died to find and never touched
because they were trapped with ideas and concepts and lexicons
we give birth mind is a genitalia it's the genitalia of awareness it has sex with reality
children emerge they can be conceptual linguistic they can have different forms than that i mean if anyone
has ideas let's hear them but we're talking specifically about conceptual linguistic and ideological children
for the moment the children of the seven question words
so yeah this is sex we don't think of it as sex
and this is a very new idea to me i'm having this idea right now after having
had you know after having been um diddled by barfield
uh in a new way and this is one of one of the reasons i love that book every time i pick it up
i'm like oh i didn't see that before i read this 10 times i didn't see it yeah this is the thing
and barfield wouldn't dare say this i mean maybe he would he doesn't say it in the book it never occurred
to me before that the output of the process of awareness is a child and that the process that
produces the child is a kind of intercourse and george i think you should be basically filling your
diapers with poo at this point because what i've just said underlies every single thing you've ever
objected to well yeah no it makes a lot of sense to me yeah i mean that reminds me of samkhya that's
one of the oldest philosophies of humanity the idea that awareness or evolution issues from this
conjunction between two principles you know so samkhya is usually regarded as a dualistic school of
hinduism but you can you can frame it in terms of sexuality which i think was done in tantrism more
explicitly but yeah i think viewing consciousness as a kind of relation even in terms of something like
sexuality i think is pretty powerful and yeah it aligns with what i what i tend to think anyway
in terms of root metaphors you'd be hard-pressed to find a better one than sex
and i think this is part of what amin hillman is on fire about but he doesn't know how to say it yet
because he's still a kind of a he's a bit of a puerile mind he really likes the dirty stuff but he's not
sure why right right so is is the tree then at all distinct from the rainbow in any way
okay okay the question is
begins not with the question is what it begins with is a purpose we have to remain focused on
this for a moment when we ask please ask the question again try to use the same language to
the degree you're able
about the tree and the rainbow
can the tree be seen
as a continuation of the same process that gives rise to the rainbow
absolutely if we focus not on the tree or the rainbow but on the participatory awareness
in which they come to life are merged
right if we if we're asking are the tree and the rainbow the same kind of thing
first of all they aren't things but let's play anyway the problem is why are we asking because
the purpose with that orients our intention to ask will determine the species of the child
that thus emerges from the fertilization process right so the species of the child that emerges from our
cognitive behavior from our awareness from the activity of our awareness coupled with our cognition
and also coupled with our relationships because as i mentioned before we think we're separate people
and i think that's an illusion it's a very trenchant illusion um and yet what what is actually going
on is that we are like mirrors networked together in a dimension we don't know the name of and so
when you ask the question can the tree and the rainbow be thought of in the same way under some
um purpose yes the answer is ridiculously stupid of course it's yes um but it's also no it just
depends on what our purpose is right if it's a if it's a bipolar question we can our purpose can
will determine whether we answer yes or no and then we think usually oh you know i've discussed i've
i've i have a correct assertion about something because i said yes or no that's insane
nothing makes it correct the only thing that determines correctness is whether the species
matches the purpose that gave that fertilized it that's all that's what correctness is
it has nothing to do with logic i mean with the purpose that i have in mind at the moment
that has nothing to do with logic or syllogisms or anything like that we're basically just asking
about the continuity of purpose and its relationship to its progeny in consciousness or speech
or identity liquidity
what you just said about correctness being what correctness is is that the same with beauty
um beauty i okay this so i retreat here i retreat from intellect's purview
because my purpose is to preserve
the divine the transcendental
the mystical nature of beauty instead of intellectualizing it i mean imagine
imagine the difference between
um the lips of the woman i most desire to kiss or i'm kissing right and then some
derivative intellectualization of them well it's just the yeah it's just the softness and the shape and
it's kind of wet you know it's moist it's alive
that's nothing to do with what i'm talking about so as regards beauty let beauty speak
let us be silent let beauty tell us let darren shut up at that cliff edge is what i say about beauty
but i'm happy to pursue the question in the spirit you offered it as well
it's almost like someone's asking me um is that the same with a dream and i'm like whoa he just said
dream i'm gonna like back the off i'm gonna shut down my intellect because that's not the right
submarine for that ocean i'm content with leaving it there i think your answer was sort of it was very
satisfactory to me but if you want to continue you're more than welcome to
so i'm just astonished at all these things i've seen um over the past you know 15 20 minutes of
what's going on here because even barfield
you know he he was very analytical um he had these words alpha thinking beta thinking figuration
and participation and also representation now i think i i realized something very weird when i was
reading him today which is a totally new understanding of what he means by representation what he means is
something more like a figure in awareness that cannot be the thing in figured but stands for it
so let's have some questions please
yeah well i would tend to view the desk in the same way as the tornado so i think it would make
more sense to regard so i think what actually differentiate something like a tool from an organic
being is is even stranger perhaps um because i think the concept of matter usually gets in the way
so we i think i think what tends to happen is that we conflate uh quiddity or substance with matter
which um obscures some of these deeper questions about time so yeah i think the concept of quiddity
whatness uh you know makes a lot of sense um but its nature is different from what we call matter
in other words matter is already a function of time at a deeper level so what actually differentiates
the tornado from the desk has nothing to do with what we usually call matter it has more to do with um
time brilliant i agree yes um oh god and that was why i brought up this relationship between the
rainbow and the tree i think something similar is going on there
it's true the um let us just simply notice that the expectation of continuity is radically different
um the rainbow is serendipitous the tree is continuous
and one of the things that happens when humans use specific kinds of intoxicants is that things that
are continuous begin to appear serendipitous and this is what nathan was talking about earlier
vis-a-vis st patrick and the shamrock let's be clear the patterns in the roof were always there they were
continuously there but they appeared serendipitously to his avenue of concern after he wrote the letter to
saint patrick this is a fundamental insight about oh go ahead
i my mic wasn't unmuted how did you know i wanted to say something
i told you we're not i told you we're not the illusion of separateness go ahead
um yeah i mean it it it's interesting because i had no prior knowledge or yeah i had no prior
knowledge that that pattern was there and yet i when i opened my eyes i it's not like i like was
scanning the ceiling it was like boom my eyes were there um right yeah but what appears is more than
just some some kind of material configuration so what appears is also something that you
supply so reality is a kind of relation or meeting between uh you know the possibility of i think
conceptualization or thinking and uh matter something like matter
in other words like what we perceive is already edetic is already uh ideal
and we experience it as thought or as concept um so quiddity i think has more to do with
the idea than with matter um can you describe what that word means again quiddity
like the essential nature of something or what something is
yeah in other words what something is can appear under a manifold of possible material guises
so what we encounter as a material object might be more than what it appears to us it might actually
be something more manifold or more more it cannot not be yeah right so what we see is like a cross
section of a larger being which i think you know is what i mean by quiddity but
your point george about time is crucial here because time is the difference between serendipity and
concreteness between momentary juxtaposition and eternity and when we look at the fork it seems eternal
the kiss cannot be thus
right well in the fork the universal laws appear in the object which is what differentiates it from
an organic being or any other like mineral object like a like a pile of sand or a rock
so the rock is governed by universal laws and is an expression of them but in the technical object or in
the fork those universal laws appear as something perceptible so there's like this kind of inversion
that takes place or like a mirroring like you were saying um but that again the human mind is what bridges
that divide so the human mind is participating in this kind of cosmic process because what we call
thought or concept the concept of something even in our language is i think accessing something that exists
so it's um it's implicit in the living kind of world or in an organic being
like uh like a tree for example i'm struck by how
i'm struck for a moment by how inclined we are to confuse the results of the tool we call language
and i really want to emphasize us calling it language because we have no idea what the
that is we confuse the results of the tool we call language not merely with that which is
i.e reality existence etc we confuse it with ourselves and this is why people kill each other
it's the primary reason it's the primary reason that people kill each other it's why there is war
it's because you would say the identification of language is essentially like moral relativism
elucidate um
um we i got into a conversation yesterday with someone and i was talking about like zooming in
and zooming out and uh the different ways in which you can move from the observer to like presence
and i don't know that that's not important and then that that led into talking about more moral relativism
um and how if you come across a tribe that is sacrificing its children to some god by torturing
it to death you think like oh geez this doesn't feel right in my body you know um and then would that
lead to you know your people slaughtering them or would it lead to that you trying to persuade them
or leaving them alone like all these questions on when you come across the behavior of something that
you don't agree with um you know what actions will you take is that the same thing as what you're
talking about with identifying with the language i mean i guess i guess elucidating this more
i'm feeling like it's they're parallel they're not the same thing but they're related and that's what's
interesting to me well done i want to say three things one we are operating above the ordinary
sphere of humans thoughts and language together right now and i i honor that two we identify with
language and things we say as if it is our body um three we should sacrifice gods to our children not
the other way around yeah well right well i mean as george lakeoff even argues i think the proportions
of our body give rise to the possibility of language itself so the reason that we speak i think is by
virtue of certain afford certain affordances made possible by the proportions morphologically in
our physical bodies so so the physical mantle actually gives us access to the possibility of
conceptualization and language i think is sort of downstream from that um i love how you so
boringly say things that would shatter heaven well right right like the angels their wings just caught
on fire while you were speaking and you're like yeah you know yeah well i mean i was i was getting i
was getting at this point last week in regard to the differentiation between the kingdoms like even like
in aristotle so you know the plant kingdom the animal kingdom and the human kingdom what actually
differentiates them um yeah so basically in so like what actually distinguishes scientifically physics
from biology for me this is a question of the differentiation between certain kingdoms that you can
understand in terms of uh the movement of the idea or its metamorphosis so um so essentially in the biological
type the idea appears as a principle within the sensory multiplicity whereas in the law the idea appears as a
principle outside uh the sensory multiplicity so in physics we contend with laws in biology we contend with
types but in either case we really mean to access the same being so the quiddity the quiddity is the same
in either way or along either path um so what happens i think in life is the the appearance of the idea within the sensory realm
which originally existed outside of it in the physical domain but then with technology the idea
appears as the lawfulness of the physical realm in terms of an object so the object instantiates
some kind of cosmic principle and language makes that possible so i mean we've talked about how like
technology arises through the eclipse of some kind of primitive symbol in language there's there's like
a kind of you can trace the path of the metamorphosis of this being uh through time so that's what i was
originally trying to maybe get to when i talked about the fork and the tree and all these things their
relationships because yeah i think we should learn to see the tree in the same way that we see the
rainbow just as i said that we should learn to see the desk in the same way that we you know see the
tornado i think there's there's a kind of symmetry there it's the same kind of movement in thinking
so in either in either case the tree is really you in the same way that the rainbow is really you when
you look at the sunset you're not looking at some thing you're looking at really your own self so
when you view the sun setting you know where is the sun setting is the sun setting on the horizon
well where's the horizon the horizon is you there's no there's no distinction i guess that's what i was
trying to say so the question of where looking out like pointing your finger out where is the sunset
is the wrong direction you should be turning it back in maybe just reversing the direction to begin with
absolutely brilliant oh yeah that's the right there this is this is the whole problem
you know it's funny um we're having a conversation as the extinction audi but mostly what
but there is something getting extinguished here and it's not the world or humanity or the ecologies
it's stupidity we are burning down stupidity right now we're like yeah get that match bro strike that
fucker oh yeah put it right yeah see those little shards right there just burn that shit up
it seems like the things that get you most excited darren is and this has been since i've known you is
you're like you're like you're like oh what what is intelligence to darren it's taking the things that
we do on a normal day-to-day basis and then just being like yeah it's all fake it's not real zoom out a bit
your uh your language your thought forms your and i'm wondering then what how how do we then
re-solidify how do we re how do we come back down to earth does that does that make does that question
make sense i mean um that's yes the way we come back down to earth is eat food shit pour a glass of
water kiss her now that's how we come back down to earth but we're not here to be down to earth
i mean i'm not here to be down to earth yeah i mean if you mean by this zoom call no no way
yeah i'm not here to be down to earth but yeah the way we get down to earth is be the body right be the
body i think i think that's how we get quote down to earth unquote but i want to say a few things about
this problem with language and us our projection of our identity onto it i noticed under a certain
circumstance that a particular person who's close to me um projected his body onto the house of my
dead father so that any movement with of an object within that house was as if someone was touching him
his body right
that was the beginning of an array of insights and i'm going to just mention one of your friends did this
uh it was actually my son
and and he he projected his body into a house so that he basically had like the house was his sensory organs
the house was his body in the sense in the specific sense that if for example my sister who you know
they were in deep conflict and both uniquely out of their minds if she moved an object that you know he
had placed in a certain place it was as if she had adjusted his genitalia without his permission without
her permission yeah without his permission right so he would then you know war did he do this consciously did
he do this on purpose no no no no no no no he was unconscious of this and so was she and this kind
of shit happens all the time but what i want to get at is
israel and gaza don't exist they are fictions of language and people have identified with these
fictions to the degree that they're blowing up children and ripping humans apart
i don't care i'm not concerned with who's right they're both wrong for sure not maybe
um but i want us to see into the process that gives birth to this crap because this is one of the most
this is one of the grave injustices of being a human being um to watch something like this happen or to
participate in it or even to be concerned with it uh is terrifying and um lethally malignant
to me so something happened remember when i said earlier that if if if you're trying to figure out
what a fork is you're probably you know you say like that's a fork not so much of a problem but if
tina does an action in a relationship and you try to figure out what she did you're gonna have a
huge problem you're gonna need the dictionary of encyclopedias to answer that problem
and so what happens is humans tend to think that the words they are using are true revelations
about meaning identity cause responsibility obligation and so forth yeah and what's worse is when non-human
things literally like processes that have captured millions of humans we have one of those processes
here we call it the united states of america or the american government or whatever you want to call
it um the department of defense but one of those things this makes a decision
there's no humans involved it's almost as if war is the inaction of misapprehensions in language
such that israel seem which doesn't israel is a fiction of language and people think some people
seem to think and feel as if the word israel means their own body right and other people thinking you know
whatever hezbollah someone some i don't know whoever attacked israel last october or whatever two octobers
ago i can't remember how long ago it was um whatever attacked israel we make a bunch of declarations about
who and what it is and then we start killing children and mothers and fathers and grandparents
and blown up hospitals i don't mean we but someone people do um and i just want you to see what's
happening here the humans have dissociated into they have dissociated into
concepts of identity that cannot be true there's no chance of them being true
literally under zero circumstances are those concepts true
and they start ripping everything that's alive a new i mean never mind like people are like they
tore down the hospital what about the billion insects and animals that died when you dropped that
bomb we're not even to count that right like the humans don't generally they just think about the
humans and that is a tragedy the humans are a tragedy what i'm trying to get at is the humans become
confused they get into this weird kind of sex with language and identity and cause and responsibility
and obligation and guilt and justice and it's really weird when groups of dissociated humans become
fascinated by this concept of justice the absolute opposite of it ensues with great fanfare and efflorescence
we need to solve that problem that's the kind of stupidity we got to put to the torch forever
and part of how we do it is by understanding how the it happens and how it happens is they're having
the wrong kind of sex in cognition with language and awareness and identity and whatness and who-ness
and whenness the seven ions of quest have become all cluster up and then the humans you know pick up
guns and start ripping apart right well nathan uh real quick i was wondering what you meant by
coming down to earth in the first place what do you mean by that
i think that when we when we come together um i i hear some of the most like insightful things
that i just i can't come up with my own i can't come up with on my own and i find it i find that
there's this grace period after we um meet where i see the world in a different way and then slowly
just being around the people that i'm around being with myself long enough it dissolves and i'm i'm left
with pieces and um like this insight about gaza it's something that i totally agree with like
like choosing a side you've already lost um anytime that there's these political rivalry things it just
totally misses the point of like what they're trying to do i think which is you know live well be happy
sort of thing um and yet it it feels very unsustainable for me to just
come together in these meetings and then we log off and then it's like okay
i'm back in the same circumstances that i was um i want to embody this i want to embody this insight i want
to uh and i don't know i i guess it have it's a slow process um but i had the feeling that if i was
always hanging around like a bunch of darrens and a bunch of tyler a bunch of george's um i would
be able to sustain that sort of thing longer and so i'm just very interested in like
i don't know community and ideas and insights and
i i can't change the world i i'm not responsible for the setting in which i'm in i don't think
globally um i can change my relationship to it and i can go into meditation and i can bliss out for hours
if i if i need slash want to um but there's a point in which i get up and uh someone's like
hey can you take the garbage out and i can do that with total bliss i could be like dang i don't want
to take the garbage like there's all these relational things i don't know but the point is like these
conversations are so beautiful i want to embody those more and i'm not even really asking for
tips but more of that that is what i was asking there oh i see yeah right okay i want to speak to
this um first of all uh george brilliant question uh nathan you did what you said you can't do by
yourself you just did it now you're not necessarily by yourself although we're both by ourselves and not
by ourselves we've established the third mind together and we're in there and so hilariously
what nathan meant by down to earth which the moment that he said that the moment that that george asked
that question i was like oh wow he means the incarnation he means like getting material getting into the
body stuff yeah being an organism and i was having a little epiphany there but uh what nathan actually
meant which i didn't speak to previously was what do we do with this how do we live this way
when we're done i have the same problem toymaker was with me and then toymaker went away that's my code
word for an angel and um for years like toymaker was so impactful that that it the aura of it lasted for
years not hours or days it lasted for like a decade or something and it's still there but how did how can i
become what i saw and was able to see from above the human the linguistic syntactical physical and
you know there's a few things i would say the first is like basic um which nathan's already pretty
good at be kind be gentle don't don't collapse time in the wrong way don't collapse identity you
know sustain the manifold of identity as open and infinite don't be quick to judge um of course judging
as beautiful isn't as much of a problem right don't be don't be quick to be an inquisitor is more than
the thing but the problem we have you know we all have this problem in modernity is that we're in a
situation we're not supposed to be in what is that it's called isolation we live in a world that poses
humans as separate creatures and there's no chance of that being true that's a fundamental fallacy that
fucks everything up when we do that and here's what happens here's how we respond symptomatically
to that problem we think things we make declarations i just made one
thinking is to away to mind and to intelligence as being nailed to a rock is to a bird and and the humans
suppose that thinking is a really great thing when really they're not thinking they're not doing anything
that resembles what they suppose they're up to they're doing something really weird which is
making dead children in language and then enacting the death of those children in relationship to
themselves and others and if someone came along and said darren aren't you doing that right now
yep i'll take that little put me you know paint that badge on my chest yes of course i am i'm thinking
but uh i like to think haha that we're doing something pretty amazing here i have the feeling that we
are which is that we've we've made the third mind and while we're together we attend it very beautifully
and reverently in a you know in a holy way and that matters now here's the problem how do we do that
when we're not here this is what i think nathan's asking and and how could how could people who are
listening and there will be people who listen to this because i'm gonna i'm gonna post this thing
um presuming that no one objects what do we do well the thing that we do is we have to literally come
together we have to make the third mind together and we have to go on missions i keep saying this over
and over again there's a broken record in my heart i got a busted lp in my heart you should see the
album cover my god it's beautiful but yeah we got to come together and go on missions so one of the
answers is sort of half making a joke here both you guys move into my house and let's do missions
but even if we can't do that and we're apart we can still go on missions together
just by inventing them and enacting them we have to do stuff and this is what i think nathan is
concerned with and wants but isn't finding in his daily life now of course we find limited ways
you know we find ways to do this when nathan goes to work at the restaurant and you know there's people
there and they're kindly informing each other of better ways you know like how to fix problem or
how to what not to do which is less useful than what to actually do together
yeah if you want to enact this remember the spirit of it in your moment to moment life and pretend that
me and george are with you and go on a mission ask the third mind what's my mission
accept at least three not one answers
mix those answers together and go act and you know one of those actions is weird enough i'm going
to mention josephine larson my friend in europe one of those actions is literally acting
to act as an actor one of those actions is acting because acting presupposes that we're acting from the
third mind not our own mind improvise you know improvisation when done in a spirit of beauty and
reverence it naturally produces magic but the main problem is that we're apart
right we're not we don't get together to do important things and notice that we are that
that whole space of where humans get together to do things is severely compromised by shit like jobs
the military prisons governments politics it's all very very compromised so that the humans rarely
forge an alliance and go on a mission together do this thing this is the thing to do find two brilliant
people like the person nathan you were having a conversation with the other day about presence and
so on and just just just say like let's go on a mission and when the other person goes like what
what like yeah we'll make it up and we'll do it something beautiful
one of my poet friends from long ago who i saw recently this guy's still alive it's amazing george albin
um we had this idea that we would like get a map of sam we would get together on like a friday or
saturday night we'd get them out of san francisco and we'd throw a dart at it and then we'd go there
and figure out why we were supposed to go there and we did it
one time we found
the um
that's funny because this is
long ago now this is like pre-2000 probably but
we found someone's backpack strewn all over the
this uh the outside of the schoolyard
and so
i collected all the things together i was like this belongs these are someone's belongings
which is hilarious when you think about it right this is to what we belong we think
what we need to belong to is each other not our possession
we need to belong to reverence and that which is holy and insight and intelligence and healing
and resurrection rescue heroic things we need to belong to that
anyway we got all the stuff together that i could find and then we figured out who the backpack belonged
to and it turned out to be a student a massage a girl who was a massage student
and um we got it back to her and she gave us both a certificate to come get a massage
and it turned out that when i went to get a massage at um
the uh the bathhouse kabuki that i she was actually working that day and she she did a massage
for me and it was the best massage in my life
my point is just like missions we gotta do shit and i have the same problem toymaker left i tried
to write everything down so i wouldn't forget that doesn't help what helps is what we're doing here
because now i begin to remember how to see when we're together with and for each other that's the
fundamental thing i was taught and if that was a demon wow it's a really weird thing for demons to be
teaching me
thank you that's that's beautiful
it's your question that fertilized the the dang problem
thank goodness child support is not required for purely imaginal concepts
it's funny because it is but it's action it's action in the service of beauty and origin
and memory beauty origin what i meant by child support was really the uh
uh the government body the court yeah the court ordered yeah i get it
but yeah so the coming down to earth it's really important in this sense but nathan actually meant
it which was not my first answer
you know there are things like demons and they're the things that replace our relationships with
functions and what's and where's and how's and so forth but i think it's really important to circle
back to this what problem um it's weird it's like a w hat that you put on your head
where you double yourself and you can't tell the difference between your origin self and the hat self
and you become the hat self and then starts happening in the ukraine
right you're like a mad hatter
precisely and it's really the code the code there that that i think lewis um god what was his real name
do you know it george i know it i just can't find it lewis carroll yeah lewis carroll yeah but that's not his name
anyway the thing he wanted us to see was one of the things he hoped we would see is this problem of whatness
and ratio and how we impose ratio how we make the cuts in the manifold of identity
which always is the result of our purpose in relation not of accuracy which is what we pretend
and this is the correct answer by the way that core rect thing that whole rect thing
it both means wreckage and it means rectangle to frame to cut off the rest of it the laboratory the labor
that rect it means right hand it means left hemisphere it means
it also means functions that have captured the humans
say again
it also means rectum
oh yeah right i mean i i think um don't be mean to the rectum because that's that's a really powerful
and beautiful feature but yeah sure the poop hole
it gets not enough uh not enough praise and too much denigration
yeah the rect it literally means right r-e-c-t um its origins etymologically mean right
and when humans become concerned about being right i was saying something the other days of some people
or i had an insight thankfully within the third mind in which i said when the people you're with are
absent what matters is being right and when the people you're with are present what matters is being more
beautiful together
so it's really weird we should call ourselves like the resurrection audi or something because
well for reasons related to what i just said
because this this kind of activity together really resurrects my spirit
right well i think most things become their opposites in the end so perhaps
i think the name is fitting fair enough
end energy novelty um distinction
novelty being like new children
the results of that that purpose of
right well the end is also the beginning
even like etymologically
yeah i think the word actually has the same root as
um
anti meaning like in front of or before so so the so the beginning and the end are the same
yeah it's easy to say facile things like that george but we gotta we gotta open it up for the listeners so
b is a pregnant woman
right that letter b it's also breasts it's the milk it's the origins the sky it's the living waters
e is emergence the energetic context the entire e entire history of
um attraction penetration fertilization pregnancy emergence emergency
all right birth birth is both
every birth is an emergency
happen now all right nothing you can do go ahead and think things make face noises do whatever you
like where this baby's going to be born so that's that e emergence
g is gravity which both means filled with eggs and attracts angels
and so we're going to have the first g is filled with eggs gravitas
powerful attractive and then the second g is going to be like filled with angels
the angels come right the the barrier between the material and the divine
uh it shatters for a moment it's it's opened it um
um what do they call that effacing thing right the uh the woman's birth canal effaces
so b-e-g-g-i self and seeing i is the self uh seems like an individual but it's also
it's that little dot above the little eye is origin and the divine and the stroke is the material in the body
n is next new novel
and the reason the this this word beginning right it has the two g's and the two n's and those inflate each other poetic origins
so the new becomes the now
right just a single vowel change new becomes the now in right right and then there's the being the eye again
right seeing at the end it's uh
uh it means to come in this ing thing to come into to draw into um experience expression it's an elopement
actually the universe is eloping with itself they're gonna get married oh god yeah fabulous
um ing right you can just sort of reiterate the previous meanings of those letters
beginning
what do you think about the emotional qualities of vowels do you have any thoughts on that
it's really important to understand the vowels are this go ahead i was considering this early today so
yeah yeah it's really important to understand that in some languages right the vowels were never
written down it's really important because they had to be supplied by a living mind for example in hebrew
prior to the masoretic markings um they had to be supplied by a living mind and what that meant was
every time you read a word you would see the alternate
voweling the alternate in vowelings of the word with your soul with your soul and so words were never
explicit in these writing systems they couldn't be explicit you would have to select with your spirit
from the possibilities so the vowels were the the place in the places in the words
and then you'd be like oh that's an e there kind of like now and new um
yeah so the vowels are the spirit letters and they are meant to remain infinite
the consonants are collapsed manifolds their structure and the vowels are the soul
and so in the same way when i was making you know i made derivations over the spelling and beginning
to give people an idea of what alphabetics is like
alphabetics is the understanding of the origins of letters and their poetic connotation
and and there's no lexicon right you have to do it live you can't just refer to the book
you got to do it with your spirit with your heart when you're doing alphabetics if you want to be good
right
i mean i made some lexicons there's a lexicon on organ and all called alphabetics and
which i talk about the spirits of each of the letters
but that's just because i knew i would forget and i would lose the spirit and i would have to be
like a regular human stumbling around you know back in my head against solid objects
what do you think of a sound like ah what does that make you feel
just the letter alpha
uh uh like to me i i feel something pleasure the letter alpha is um oh yeah
a sense of majesty awesome a sense of awe um
but yeah i think it has more pleasure than a sound like e e feels a little more painful but i was
just curious if you have any thoughts on that because you know it's weird because they had
planetary associations with the vowels
that's interesting worth learning more about um so i said um yeah look each of the vowels when
expressed by themselves i think it's deceptive because we will we will feel and see
um one angle of the letters soul in the circle
one angle of the letters soul in the circle um ah eh eh eh eh oh ooh yeah
i mean aleph or alpha is beginnings
it's the spirit it's the lightning it's the um that's why you know all a w e it's the lightning
it's a splitting energy um and when i say it's i don't mean this is all it is or it's only this i just
mean you know what's coming to mind for me at the moment but yeah there's an alphabetics underlying our
language and we don't know it but when we speak we're making music
we are invoking the spirits of the muses for a specific purpose and if it's a beautiful purpose
well done if our purpose is to dissociate or to become dumber we should probably try another angle
especially if the purpose becomes violence or selfishness
think about the letter k right it's literally like you're bouncing a ball off a wall and changing its
almost it's... now
day knowledge
ivasava
what's the problem then in the garden knowledge
one of those legs on the k is good and the other one's evil and they're bouncing off of me and
and now I'm scared. I'm afraid I've done something wrong. W in
the beginning, the doubled self. You can even say that K gives
birth to W. Right? When that ball hits the wall, it makes a V in
the mind in the mirror of the mind, the V becomes a W. There
are secrets and shapes of the letters, not merely their sounds.
The O is everything origin, right? You is the cup into which
origin reflects. It's the mirror, the universe. The eye is the
seer. A is the one who sees.
When did this become apparent to you, these connections?
Toymaker dragged me through the evolution of human consciousness
and showed me how the letters, where they came from and where
they came from was nothing like abstract denotation. It was all
and terror and dreaming and adoration.
Right. Where can I learn more about these associations? Do you have
them like on your website?
I thought we were up to that. Was I confused?
What do you mean?
Together we together we will remember and learn more. We'll do the
archaeology.
But yeah, there's a there's a alphabetics essay on my on my
website, which I, you know, I try to record some of the features
of this. But the shapes I don't talk about.
Oh, I see. Right.
Actually, it's not entirely true. I do talk about the shapes.
But not, you know, not in the third mind as we are now.
Yeah, there was a connection, I think, in Hermeticism between the
use of the compass and straight edge and certain mystical
ideas about the origins of our letters in Latin, Greek and
Hebrew.
Yes. Yes. So it goes back to Freemasonry. And yeah, it's
interesting. No, no, no. Freemasonry goes back to the
origins. So you have that backwards, my friend.
Basically, it comes down to angles.
Right. Right.
Don't just notice where something divides or where there's a line or
a curve. Notice the specific angle.
So for the E, it's what, 45 degrees? Or is that 90? I can't
remember.
The little E. Put each letter inside a circle. Trace it out.
You'll begin to understand if you've got insight.
The problem for humans is that they think they can make
representations of spirit.
Can't do it.
That's what you shouldn't do.
All right. That's why writing a lot of this down is a mistake.
It's one that unfortunately I became extremely fascinated by.
No, it's, this is why they were, they were upset a long time ago with
the invention of writing. They were like, no, no, we got to make the
third mind together and see together.
This writing thing, it's dead inside.
It's not only bad, but you follow me, right?
Yeah. Yeah.
I mean, what we're doing here is coming down to earth in the sense that
Nathan meant we're enacting it.
And there is a way to enact by speaking together and we're doing it.
This is how it's done.
This is, and you know, it starts with a really beautiful purpose.
And what is the purpose?
It's some kind of an amnesis.
It's seeing from above.
It's rising above the ordinary human situation, remembering origin, the mothers,
the fathers, the children, the sky, the world, the eyes, dreaming,
remembering these together.
It becomes powerful.
It's very powerful compared to any ordinary action we commonly do.
Right.
I mean, Zen though, is the, uh, recognition of the transcendental in the ordinary.
Except to say it that way violates the whole damn thing.
It's something one does rather than something one says.
So were you saying that Freemasonry is at the origin of something?
No, I was saying the opposite.
Uh, Freemasonry is a system, uh, not a very good one for, uh, encoding.
It's a cryptographic system, right?
It's, it's spiritual crypt, cryptography.
Um, we got a lot of systems like that.
Uh, the tarot is one, um, astrology is another, uh, it's, you know, these are toys that mostly
fail unless the aspirant monk, the nun is awakening spirit in their soul and their heart while playing
while playing with these toys, the toys are themselves not useful.
And they're deceptive because we think, Oh, it's just like the problem with psychedelic drugs, right?
I think like, Oh, this is the, this is the doorway to enlightenment.
Oh yeah, let's go.
But that's not what's going on.
The enlightenment is the soul of the beings and the memory of the mothers.
I mean, I use the mothers.
I say this, this word a lot, but I really mean, you know, I mean, our, those who gave birth to us with reverence, all of them, not just my mom.
I mean, my mom was a local instance and praise her.
I adore her, but, uh, yeah, all of them.
Um, there's so many things we ignore, right?
The reproductive intelligence of the, of the biological beings is unimaginably profound.
Which fertilizers produce, which children and in consciousness, purpose is the fertilizer of possibility.
So if your purpose is good, you'll have, you'll have children who are amazing, um, in, in awareness, right?
Purpose is everything.
It determines the species of the progeny.
Um, and by species, I mean, sort of more, I know I'm using a stancherous word, what they become, what they will enact.
Many people have realized that spelling and casting spells are related, but they don't actually understand it.
Most of the people who say these kinds of things, often when this is said, I should say, um, it's like a trivial one-off joke.
Like, oh yeah, spell and spelling, ha ha.
No, no, it's not like that at all.
It's actually infinitely profound.
And this is why many holy people refuse to speak.
Because what they're doing is they're dwelling in the before of the fertilization when, when all of the potential, the pure undifferentiated potential is nascent.
And thus not formed, unformed, right?
And mostly when the humans form things, they deform them.
You know, you said something earlier, George, about tools, you began to say something and you didn't finish it.
This is the most dangerous fucking thing.
It's the single most dangerous thing.
And that's why people, some humans who are intelligent.
They don't speak.
And I'm being an idiot.
I'm saying things, you know, I'm making face noises.
It's not impossible to be beautiful with speech.
It's unlikely.
If the purpose is really good, then, you know, the outcome may improve us.
Most of the time, silence has precedent.
What do you really mean by the idea of purpose there?
Can you help me understand that?
Because when I think of purpose, I think of technology.
Wow.
That's confusing and tragic.
The purpose is extrinsic.
Purpose is something, in my view, which is extrinsically imposed.
And so, therefore, it's related to technology.
You are someone who I love very deeply.
But in this particular case, you've become deluded by a bias.
And I think, George, you are often deluded by the biases of what you object to.
There are things you object to, and that forges your purpose in writing and speech.
Because when I see your writing, I notice a specific feature of it
that I think you'll probably agree to, which is that it is corrective.
Right.
Well, it's contra.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So, I mean, I essentially view love in opposition to purpose.
I think that love and purpose are opposed in science.
So, I think you can do science without any sense of purpose.
You can do science purely in terms of observation,
which I think is what the true scientific method probably is.
But, yeah.
Whereas our whole, like, scientific enterprise is built upon the notion
of some kind of extrinsic or ulterior motive,
which is bound up with technology.
All right.
So, why did you ask yourself this question?
Why did you say what you just said?
What was your motivating impetus?
I think what motivates me is unveiling, you know,
the conditions that obscure deeper understanding.
So, that would be-
We have the same fucking purpose.
I love that purpose.
But rather than say, as we often do, and I have the same problem when I write,
I'm immediately inclined.
When Toymaker was with me, I could do the other thing much more easily,
which is to show what is good, what we should do.
But without Toymaker, I'm much more inclined to show, to just say what we shouldn't do, right?
The critical.
And that critical thing is a trap.
This is a fundamental polarity.
You want to be on the right side of, quote, unquote.
Or on the left side of, whatever, right?
So, we want to show what is good wherever we can.
Because the humans don't respond well to negations.
They respond well to opportunity.
So, give them an opportunity, they're likely to pick it up.
Give them what not to do, they're probably going to do that thing.
Right, well, again, I don't speak with a purpose.
So, I guess that's like, I'm not speaking for the sake of catalyzing some purposeful change in another person.
Yeah, you've misunderstood purpose.
If you didn't have a motivation, you wouldn't say doodly squat, to quote Kurt Vonnegut.
Right, yeah.
So, there are multiple senses in which, I mean, I can take purpose, so.
Yeah, I hope so.
Yeah, I think, I don't disagree with you at all.
Yeah, so when you ask me what I mean by purpose, what I mean is your motivation.
So, I have one, I had one, just now, where I could speak.
You would not be able to act if there wasn't an angle in the sphere that was charged for you.
And often, people who are enlightened, they play freely within the sphere.
They can see where they're charged.
They don't collapse to that.
So, they play freely.
They un-collapse the manifold instead of collapsing it, a bubble of many bubbles, so to speak.
That's what I mean by manifold.
Right, no, that, of course, I think is right.
And what dreaming does is that, right?
Dreaming collapses the manifold and then adds, it takes away, for example, it takes away three bubbles and adds five new ones.
And then takes four of those away, and it keeps playing that way.
It's not like waking mind in that sense.
When we make music, like you and Nathan were doing here, then we're adding, then we're messing with the bubble structure.
When we play, we're joking.
Joking is actually adding bubbles back where they had been previously collapsed.
When it's done well, right, when comedy is done well, when it's like that.
So, this is the thing to do, learn to add bubbles back.
In awareness and thought and identity, add bubbles back.
That will go well.
Most, much, much more of the time than the other game, anyway.
So, what do I mean, my purpose?
I mean, the motivations that move you to speak or think.
Is that a fair answer?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
So, usually, we think about what we're going to say, or how we've said it, or something like this, or if we believe it, or blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, and we don't look at why we were concerned with something.
That's what purpose is.
That's a better, I've gone a level up.
What was the cause of your concern?
And if you look very deeply into this matter, what caused your concern, enlightenment will ensue in a cascade.
Yeah, the cause of my concern, I think, is a certain absence.
So, an absence of beauty.
We agree about that.
It's the absence.
Mm-hmm.
An absence of balance, absence of health.
Right.
Yep.
Absence of intelligence, absence of awareness, absence of insight, absence of love, absence of dreaming, absence of mothers, absence of children.
Right, yeah, but when I try to articulate myself, my purpose, I think, is usually, you know, quite different from petitioning.
So, you know, I tend to, yeah, I tend to sort of withdraw from this impulse to petition other people to do something on my behalf.
So, rather, I think I experience speech or, you know, self-expression as a kind of act, which I love for its own sake.
So, you can think of it like art, I suppose.
So, there are some artists who might create a work of art for the sake of instilling or inspiring another person, instilling some sensation in another person.
But there are other artists, I think, who work under a different premise.
It's true.
Yeah.
So, therefore, purpose has to be more than just, you know, a singular noun.
Oh, yes.
Well, it can become very singular, but when it does, it's either pragmatic or delusional.
Right.
Yeah.
I want you to notice, I'm going to say something very personal for a moment.
Is that okay?
Yeah.
You have an affect.
And it's an affect of flow.
It's not an affect of speech, perhaps, but it occurs in your speech.
Do you know what I'm pointing at yet?
No, because I don't think the effect is actually mine.
It is.
It could be.
It is yours.
Yeah, it's yours.
Basically, I feel like what I want is to evacuate my own self, to get myself out of the way so that I can view what I regard as art.
So, what actually gives me a sensation of beauty or value in speech or in, you know, my own self-expression is really a kind of removal of myself.
So, I don't really attribute myself to what I experience as beauty.
I'd like you to re-include yourself in the beauty.
I'm inviting you.
Yeah.
So, this is probably what underpins what I was talking about in terms of purpose.
So, there's a connection between those two things.
So, the affect, which is very Georgian, is you do a long nasal inhale.
You recognize the behavior?
Yeah, but that's how I get – yeah, okay.
Yeah, I know what you're – yeah, that's fascinating.
Okay.
Okay, good.
It's very – I'm all in my state of consciousness.
It's like –
Mm-hmm.
I know.
Yeah.
I know.
But you're literally nasally drawing spirit.
And it's powerful.
I just want you to see how, in your speaking, when you exhibit that affect, there's something profound going on.
And I'd like you to become more aware of it over time.
You willing?
Yes, yeah.
Yes, yeah.
Excellent.
Yeah, so, that's true.
So, I'm usually unconscious of my own physical –
Affects.
Effects.
Or even, yeah, like gesticulations, movements.
But it's important –
Let's be clear.
I'm using the word affect, not effect.
An affect is a personal idiosyncrasy of behavior or communication.
In this sense, in the sense I mean, it's A-F-F-C-T.
Just to be clear that it's not effect.
Are we clear on that?
Right.
Because I was calling, in effect, a purpose earlier.
Right, right, right.
An affect is a personal idiosyncrasy.
And this is what is commonly –
We commonly say that certain neurodiversions are affect-deficient.
They don't understand affect.
I'm not claiming you're one of those neurodivergents.
I'm just pointing out that you have this affect.
And I think it's powerful, and there's something profound to be learned
from becoming very aware of the affect.
Well, it isn't quite clear to me yet.
So when you say affect, when I think of affect,
I think of some kind of instilled sensation.
Like, if I have an affect, then –
I mean, I can take that in a few different senses.
When you say affect, do you mean something that I sort of give you
or that I instill in you, or is it –
No, you're still thinking of effect.
Yeah, so I'm not really clear on it yet.
Okay, imagine that when someone says the word connotation,
they kind of curl their finger in a certain way.
They curl their index finger like a hook.
Okay.
That's an affect.
Okay, that makes sense.
All right.
Okay, cool.
Yeah, it's a personal idiosyncrasy.
And this one that I'm pointing at is very powerful
because you're doing something spiritual
while you're forming up to continue speaking.
And it's beautiful.
There's no judgment here.
I think there's some wisdom to be gained
by looking into this matter more consciously.
Well, that's exciting.
That's good to be able to hear.
I feel the same way.
I mean, I have affects too, right?
Like, I mean, when I do my little Almond Hillman thing,
that's an affect.
I've chosen to develop this affect.
Nate, are you still out there?
Yeah.
I wonder what Nate's up to.
He's probably listening and doing, like, 19 things,
which is fine.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
Hello?
Yeah, I'm listening and also doing five other things.
But this is the most important thing,
so it has my most attention.
Beautiful.
Love it.
Yeah, I have a variety of affects.
So, Nate, question.
Let's have a question.
Give me one.
Give me a question.
What's an affect that you notice about me?
Let's turn this into something about me.
You've been talking about George this entire time.
I've been quite jealous.
Oh, yeah, bro.
Yeah.
I love you.
Love you, Nathan.
Yeah.
Hit it, Chewy.
Hit it.
That's not enough.
My bottomless pill.
My bottomless pill.
Yeah, so what Nathan does is...
Full of satisfaction.
It's not good anymore.
Yeah, one of the things I love about Nathan,
whose voice is a little bit robotic at the moment
due to inconstant electronic transmission protocols,
is that I'll say something stupid.
Nathan will be in the room with me,
and I'll say, like, let's say I'll start to say something kind of mean
about someone, which this actually happened one time.
It was...
I was saying something kind of mean about a specific person in Italy,
and Nathan, his eyes changed.
They went from looking at me to looking into something that doesn't exist,
and his body language shifted toward a more protective,
um, expression.
And then he paused,
and he went into another universe for a moment,
and he said something resembling...
I can't remember what he said.
I know what its meaning was, though.
Darren, what are you doing?
Stop doing that.
You're making a mistake.
This isn't you.
You're playing a pattern that's familiar to you,
but you're not present with your heart.
Come back to your heart.
Refill your heart.
And then speak again, please,
because you're just crashing.
You're just making a car wreck, buddy.
Why would you do that?
Something like that.
So Nathan will look into infinity.
He'll go to his soul and his heart,
and he'll get this look in his eyes that's unfocused,
nonspecific,
and then he'll say something very profound and childlike
and beautiful and heartful
because he's addressing an injustice
that's both unnecessary and egregious.
And he doesn't attack me.
He doesn't say, like,
Darren, you're a bad man.
He's like, Darren, you're a better man than this.
What are you doing?
That's an affect I've seen.
Not to mention the finger drumming thing,
which is I'm doing 19 things in my mind at the same time,
and I'm just going to express that
with my fingertips on some solid surface for a minute.
That was a joke, but I really appreciate that.
Thank you for...
Because that definitely helps me
orient more towards the change
that I want to make in the world,
which is being more heart-centered
and loving towards each other.
Hey, I just have to say,
you're one of the most beautiful souls
I have ever encountered.
Whatever serendipity or happenstance brought you to me,
God, I'm so grateful for that
because you are just a beautiful soul.
I mean, I'm sure you know this,
but never forget it,
and I need you to hear it from me right now.
Yeah, I appreciate it,
and it's a good thing that
we're not too separate, you and I,
or any of us in this call,
or beyond the call.
Where are you?
What's the music in the background?
I'm in a store.
I'm looking for fabrics that appeal to my art,
which is not...
I'm not used to shopping by myself,
but it's been something I've been interesting in lately
because I think there's something to be said
about the clothes that we wear
and how it reflects ourselves,
and I'm just kind of exploring that
because normally what I put on
is out of pure utility,
and it hasn't felt good lately.
That's good to hear.
Are you still looking for a cloak?
Yeah, although this store doesn't have a cloak,
so I'm just kind of listening and absorbing
and then satisfying the thinking part of my brain
with endless fabric clothing.
It allows me to focus
and sort of internalize what you're saying
more than if I was just motionless,
which is also...
Finger drumming is another way of doing that,
but my hands are tired, so...
I mean, fabric is so aesthetic.
I'm not sure it's...
You know, I'm not sure it's thinky.
It's very aesthetic.
Thinking, feeling,
it kind of blends in together sometimes.
I agree, but fabric seems synesthetic to me.
I think synesthetic...
Let me get away from the speaker a little bit.
Synesthetic stuff is more engaging than thinking,
and sometimes I think with synesthetics.
That's why my synesthesia at its peak
was a form of shorthand
that I could use to navigate ideas much quicker
than if I was just using words.
And I still do that to some extent,
but I also find myself thinking less
and feeling more these days,
especially after Vipassana.
Are you still working at the Waldorf School
or just the Italian place or both,
or what's going on?
I'm working at the Italian place right now.
The Waldorf School is a slow crawl,
and I don't even know if it's going to be fruitful,
but I'm in the process of getting, like,
approved by the government
to be around kids
through my fingerprints
and background checks and all that.
Wow, that's hilarious and weird.
I mean, I kind of get it,
but, uh,
damn, we have to be approved
to be around kids?
Okay.
Yeah, they got to make sure
I don't have, like, a record or anything.
Sure, sure.
I mean, I understand that part,
but the, um,
it's so weird how the desire
or the, uh,
the motivation
to intervene
in wrongdoing
delimits
and
in structures
in a bad way
our lives.
I just think
that's really, really weird.
Like,
never have the ages
been more segregated,
and the reason
they are segregated
is because
there's some wrongdoers.
There's a,
I hope,
a small population
of wrongdoers.
Yeah, that's
pretty fascinating, Nathan.
I'm glad to hear that.
Although it's still
not totally clear
if you'll pursue it
to the end
or just
experimenting.
Yeah, I mean,
it's out of,
it's out of my hands
at this point.
They have to
approve me
and, um,
yeah,
we'll just see
how that plays out.
I'm,
I'm not attached
to any sort of outcome.
I would love
that opportunity,
um,
for many reasons,
but
I'm,
I'm less obsessed
with this idea
of purpose
and, like,
what am I here
to do,
what is,
why am I
incarnated
sort of thing.
I think it's,
that sort of thing
will reveal itself
if there really is
some sort of plan
for me.
So I'm just gonna
bring beauty
into every day
and have that intention.
I figure I'm gonna
land somewhere
pretty good.
I mean,
I'm in a good place
right now
just by showing up.
There's no place
I'd rather be
than right here
on this call.
So why do I need
to plan my whole future
when I can just stumble
into beauty
all the time?
It's funny,
I had a friend,
a nude friend
who came to visit
recently
and, um,
was very concerned
about,
there was a conflict
between,
um,
the possibility
of a romantic
relationship
and
the imperative
of making the world
a better place.
And we talked
a lot about it.
Thankfully,
I think we were
able to achieve
some insight.
But the conflict
was between
a sort of
an accounting
feature.
And one side
of the accounting
feature was like,
this is a desperate
time.
I have to be
totally available
to make the world
a better place
every minute.
And so I can't
commit to anything
involving a relationship
that doesn't serve
that.
And another aspect
that was like,
wow,
there's this beautiful,
amazing person
in my life
and I don't know
what to do
around this.
I want
to be with it
and,
but I feel
that I,
I shouldn't
defect
from my
messianic mission,
so to speak.
and it's
very familiar
because it's,
it's endemic
to a specific
generation
or a set
of generations
after mine.
they know
the world
might not
continue to exist
so they feel
like everything's
very urgent
and they shouldn't
commit.
And all I said
was,
you know,
this,
this aspect
of you
that's doing
the accounting
is not
the aspect
to be relating
with humans
with.
I'm not denying
its importance,
I'm just saying
like,
that's not the
driver for the
car that you're
in.
And that,
basically,
that one insight
fixed the
problem.
And the reason
that I mention
this is,
my purpose
in mentioning
it,
is that
the part
part of us
that plans
abstractly
for futures
is not
present
in presences.
And it's
confused
because it's
abstract.
It's imagining
things that
aren't here
and it's
responding
as if they're
real.
it's
literally
like
inventing
a tree
that
you
can't
see
and
doesn't
actually
have
roots
and
isn't
there.
And so
one of the
things I
heard Nathan
say
was,
I don't
need to
plan for
the future
in the
sense
that deprives
me of the
capacity to be
here with
the people I'm
with where I am
right now.
And yeah,
I agree.
I'm not
saying
I use that
trope.
I'm not
saying we
should never
plan for the
future.
There's a
dimension in
which that's
useful and
intelligent and
important.
But we
shouldn't let
it that
concern,
that sort of
pragmatic
aspect,
run what's
going on.
And I
think Nathan's
very aware
of this,
even though he
does get
confused about
it.
Because whenever
he's faced
with a
commitment,
he's got to
renegotiate
the situation.
It's very
true.
But I
definitely
have,
this past
week,
actually,
I don't
know,
it's hard to
find the
timescale,
but it's
been difficult
lately,
just in
general,
to be
alive.
We agree
about that.
And through
that hardship,
I have
found the
power and
the beauty
of being
present with
what is in
front of you
instead of
constantly trying
to climb to
the next best
thing, because
it totally
just dishonors
and deprives
you of all
the great
that's happening
right now.
Yeah, I
mean,
we live
in a time
where there
are cars
that drive
themselves.
That must
be very
fucking
confusing
for the
humans.
There's
such a
metaphor
and a
trope
there.
If you
think about
the metaphor
of a car
with no
driver,
you basically
got the
metaphor of
modernity
in a
nutshell.
I was
saying last
week that
humanity is
on a
train and
it's like a
really bad
Looney Tunes
cartoon where
the train is
doing like
900 miles an
hour and
it has
totally been
driven right
off the
cliff,
right?
But it's
going so
fast that
it's not
falling yet.
and everybody
on the
train knows
that there's
nothing,
there's no
fucking
track
underneath
us and
the train
can't just
keep going
this way.
But the
ordinary humans
have not the
slightest idea
what to do
about that,
so they just
keep going.
And in this
case, you
know, it's the
momentum of the
train that
keeps it in
the air for
the moment and
I think most
of us can
sense that
that's not
going to
fly.
Ha ha.
And so the
part of us
that thinks
about the
future is,
I mean,
the other
weird thing
about the
train is
that there's
nobody in
the fucking
there's nobody
in the
engineer's
compartment.
There's no
one driving
it.
That shit's
empty.
There's like
ghosts and
shit in
there.
There's
nothing in
there.
And so
obviously,
you know,
we're not
going to
survive
the transit.
Something
won't survive
the transit
anyway.
Right.
Also, I
think following
through with
a plan is
usually
easier if
you refrain
from learning.
So the more
time that you
spend learning,
the less
likely I
think you
will be to
actually follow
through with
any presumed
plan.
So learning
generally updates
plans.
So.
Brilliant point.
Once again,
it's a scope
problem, right?
You don't want
to not have
plans, but if
plans are the
entire scope,
you're screwed.
like it would
be impossible to
drive a car
with a plan.
The plan is
maybe underlying
the transit,
but moment to
moment, you
have to adjust.
It's similarly
true in Tai Chi.
particularly push
hands.
Go ahead and
have a plan,
see where that
gets you.
You're going to
be screwed.
You have no
hope with
anyone who has
any skill at
all.
With an
unskillful
person, what
happens is it
just becomes a
wrestling match,
which isn't
Tai Chi.
Yeah, I
think plans,
they usually
serve to
instill a
false sense
of security.
They make
action possible
because they
initially give
you the sense
of control.
You've listed
all the key
variables, you've
organized all the
key variables,
you've articulated
all the key
variables, and
now once you've
gone through
this ritual, you
can then proceed
to act.
But generally
the plan kind
of just falls
apart anyway.
By the way,
that P thing,
that in Hebrew,
the P letter,
it means the
back of the
head, which
you're trying to
protect because
it's really
easy to
strike it.
So there's a
vulnerability
there that
you're trying
to adjust
for.
And the L
is a bridge
above obstacles.
And the A
is the
primordial
principle.
And the N
is outcome.
So you
imagine an
outcome.
Now, again,
with very
pragmatic
things, I
want to put
water in
the glass.
Not a
problem.
Works great.
Very rarely
do I fail at
putting water
in a glass.
Almost never.
The problem
is when I
transfer that
concreteness and
continuity onto
something that's
infinite,
right?
Has infinite
variables.
And then I
think, well,
I'm in
control.
We could do
the alphabetics
on control,
too.
Oh, we
should.
So C, in
this case,
is both
the way
light propagates
in a medium.
It's the
method light
uses to
propagate,
which is a
pathfinding
method.
We could call
it a pathfinding
method,
reasonably.
And
the O
is everything,
right?
So we're going to
do pathfinding
through everything.
In this
case, N
is negation
of threats,
right?
Threat
negation.
T is a
tree,
right?
So it's many
branches of
possibility,
C-O-N-T.
R is to
radiate over
the possibility
space with
the branches.
O is the
new universe
that's created
by that
process,
control.
L, and
that's,
again, the
bridge,
above
obstacles.
But it's
the second
phase bridge,
right?
The first
phase bridge
is the
principle.
Oh, wait.
No, I was
getting confused
there.
The first
phase bridge
of L is
the principle.
If you see
two Ls,
it's the
principle,
which we don't
have in
control.
But if you
see two Ls,
it's the
principle of
a bridge above
all obstacles,
and then it's
the actual
bridge that
gets made,
the difference
between the
potential and
the outcome,
right, or
two Ls,
when you see
L, L together,
like,
illumine.
Yeah,
C-O-N-T-R-O-L.
You can
see this
principle of
the double Ls
that I'm
talking about
here in
the common
colloquialism
LOL,
right?
It's the
principle of
a bridge above
all obstacles,
then there's
the universe,
then there's
the actual
outcome,
which turns
out to have
been hilariously
ironic,
right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Right?
Hmmm.
Questions?
We
are on.
where else does the double L occur?
Can you give me another example?
Oh, it's all over the place.
Let's see, it's hard just with doing it with my brain
because I'm not looking at words.
I like illumination.
I mean, ill, illness, right?
It's the possibility space and then the actual outcome.
Should I use a computer?
I don't want to,
but I'm having trouble thinking of double L words
at the moment.
Well, I thought of jolly.
Does that apply?
Oh yeah.
Let's say, so the J is like a bouncing ball, jubilance.
It's a ball sort of just bouncing around happily.
O is everything.
It's the context in which the ball is bouncing
and gravity and stuff like that, electrons and stuff.
The first L is the principle of transition
over a possibility space.
And the second L is the actual path taken by the ball.
The Y, whoa.
That one's harder.
It's because I use the letters so infrequently
compared to the others.
Okay.
So imagine a human being standing
with their arms upraised to the sky,
both receiving and transforming the origin world.
Like at the end of this disc over Y discovery.
That's one way to understand why.
But another way is when you look at letters,
you want to look at the baseline
and think about the relationship
between the parts to the baseline.
So if the parts go underneath the baseline,
which is where the letter,
all the letters align on a line, a baseline,
if the part goes underneath it,
then it's not like with the Y,
the little Y, the part goes underneath it, right?
And so there's an angle that goes from the sky
to the earth, but it also goes to the underworld.
And then there's the other angle
that just goes from the sky to the baseline.
That's important, right?
That feature is important.
You have to notice when things go into the underworld,
like the lowercase g or the lowercase y.
Now, how does that apply to the lowercase j?
Yeah.
Okay.
So the lowercase j is making a little universe
in the underworld.
It's making a U, the U shape.
That's a cup.
That cup can receive and hold and mirror things.
Does that make sense?
Yeah.
But it's also very important to notice
that in Hebrew the letter Yud
is the only letter that doesn't touch the baseline.
And it's the beginning of the tetragrammaton, right?
It's the origin as the father,
as the being that dwells in unity, that Yud.
And that Yud is what becomes the dot
above the J and the I in English.
Very few people know about such matters.
Some rabbis might.
I guess one double L letter is ebullient,
but that's a very strange word.
Or one double L word, excuse me.
And why does that word come to mind?
And why does that word come to mind?
Oh, I'm just trying to find,
I'm just trying to do what you asked me,
which is to find, you know.
Oh, I see.
Right, right.
All right, let me, let me, let me think about it.
Or let me, let me feel into it at least.
All right, let me, let me, let me feel into it at least.
All right, I got one.
Um, but it's not a question per se.
It is something that is interesting to me and been on my mind,
and I'm sure it'll lead into a question.
Um, so something that I've been really interested in is connection with spirit
and all these yogis, which I love listening to the yogis.
Um, I, I can't, you know, um, sorry.
Um, I can't, you know, emulate their every priestly move, holy move.
Um, but they say things that always just stir up, like, wonder and amazement.
And one, one thing they talk about is getting sustenance from the universe.
And, you know, food in, when you look at it a certain way, is kind of an illusion.
Um, and so in a journey to explore that for myself and see what comes out of that,
I, you know, I'm aware.
That I can go a long time without eating food.
Um, I'm not at risk of starving to death.
And if that becomes the case, I have enough people that care about me
that would be able to feed me in an emergency.
So I'm not, I'm not putting myself at risk with this experiment,
but I'm essentially saying, what I'm attempting to do is no longer worry about food.
Like put no, just completely live under the assumption that I will be fed no matter what.
And if I'm not fed, that's not a problem.
Um, if I go two days without food, that is not going to be an indication that I'm actually going to stir up to death.
Um, and there's a, there's a few reasons why I'm doing that.
Um, but what has come of it so far is I've just noticed more people extending their hand and being like,
Hey, Nathan, you want some food?
Hey, Nathan, you want some food?
Um, and I'm spending less time actually going out and getting it myself.
And, and so that's been interesting.
And also, consequently, I've been giving a lot of food away because of the assumption that that food will come back to me.
So I'm not like hoarding it or anything.
And it's such a beautiful and free way of living and engaging with the world.
And I think that this sort of practice and experiment can be extended to everything, not just food.
Um, you know, the, the fact that we're all connected and the fact that we are, um, yeah, I don't know, um, that that's, what's been on my heart and mind lately is this, this interplay between what it means to really even possess anything, be attached to food, be attached to objects, giving freely and receiving freely rather than playing an accounting game.
Beautiful.
Beautiful.
Yeah, by the way, that word P-O-S-S-E-S, very, very trippy alphabetics there.
Um, I may or may not descend into them, but, uh, the, the double O, right, the food.
So if you look at the word fire, right, it's one of the, one of the best and most amazing, um, examples, exemplars.
Exemplars of alphabetics because you cause by frequency, you change the frequency, right?
You raise the frequency of energy and by raising the frequency of energy, you fragment an identity, right?
A log of wood, some kindling.
Um, and the result is the radiation of energy, F-I-R-E, fragmenting an identity radiates energy.
This is the secret of the atomic bomb, right?
Like, this, and it's written in English letters, and the ordinary people do not see it, but some of those who listen will.
Um, so the food thing, it's a fragment of the universe, and you draw it into the universe inside you, and you digest it,
which is basically a nourishing fragmentation in which the fragments are reunified in new ways, F-O-O-D.
Now I've had, you know, I've had sort of prickly people come to me and say,
well, you know how to do this in English, but it's not the same thing in every other language.
If this were true, it'd be true in every language. It is true in every language.
It's just not the same truth in every language.
Nourishment is fundamental to existence. It doesn't come from food.
Um, though pragmatically, there's a necessity for occasional nourishment and rejuvenation, resurrection.
For living bodies. And animals and humans will starve, if not fed.
Um, but as far as humans go, which is very far, the idea is that...
the idea... you'll feel hunger... for a time.
But if you fast, which is hilarious because it actually does speed you up,
um, all kinds of crazy things happen.
And not everybody can fast safely, but some people can fast essentially forever.
What I'm trying to get at here is that the idea of what is a human,
or common ideas of what a human, quote, is, unquote, are completely misfounded.
They are founded on fictional suppositions about pragmatic matters and the transfer of those pragmatisms,
which aren't real to all aspects.
So you'll see someone who, with no legs, can free-climb a cliff.
And then you'll see someone with legs who can't climb a ladder.
They're both human, right?
So the idea that we know what it is to be human and it's these things is completely misfounded.
Your humanity is an infinite array of potentials.
And those potentials can be elaborated in unimaginable ways.
This is why we love ballerinas and, you know, brilliant lecturers.
Who am I thinking of? I'm thinking literally of, um, God, Spalding Gray.
If you haven't listened to Spalding Gray, get on that.
Yeah. Watch one of his films.
Um, Swimming to Cambodia. Watch that.
Okay.
Now, is there anything heavenly about the letter F in particular?
There's an old Hebrew Zohar parable in which each of the letters approach God
and they ask to be the letter on which the universe is founded.
And God explains in alphabetics why he can't found it on them.
And they come in reverse order.
They start at the end and they go to the beginning of the alphabet.
And when B comes before God,
God says, hang on, just hold on.
I got to talk to A first.
And God says to A, you are the first principle, but you're, he tells each letter why they can't,
the universe can't be founded on them because they're so important for these six other things.
Right?
I can't take you away from these six other things that are absolutely necessary.
It's hilarious what's going on right now because B is the dogs barking.
But, um, so he tells A like, you're amazing.
You're the first principle.
It's all good.
I can't found the universe on you though, because I need you to inform the other letters.
And, uh, then he comes to B and he says on you, I will found the universe with the word bear shape in the Torah.
The first word.
So yeah, every letter, every letter has its originary spiritual aspect.
And, you know, I learned about this through the Hebrew.
Hillman's claim is that the Hebrew is stolen from the Greek.
Let me be clear about something with Hillman.
Guy's got a chip on his shoulder, the size of Mount Everest.
And he's wrong.
He's wrong about this.
Um, but he's not only wrong.
There's something we can truly learn from him.
The problem is it doesn't matter which one came first.
You see, it's not A that is the important thing.
He's saying, no, pay attention to A, pay attention to A.
And I'm saying like God in this parable.
No, be.
Hebrew came second.
So what?
You think that's the, that's a problem?
I could wreck Hillman on this topic.
And I might just do it.
Hmm.
If he doesn't, if he doesn't interview, if he doesn't do an interview with me soon, I'm going to publish a second essay.
Oh, wow.
About how unstop, how Mr. Unstoppable has got it backwards.
B actually matters.
Um, we go through phases in learning and I've learned a lot from Hillman and he's, you know, he's a provocateur and I love it.
Love it.
Yeah.
Hit it.
Chewy hit it.
No, not that one.
No, no, no.
Take that one down.
Right.
He does the same fucking thing.
Right.
It's like, no, no, not that one.
That's for later.
He does the same thing.
And he doesn't see himself doing it.
And he doesn't realize like, this is what, this is exact.
What you just said to Chewy is how you're wrong about Hebrew.
He doesn't get it.
Yeah.
But I'll enlighten that, that, uh, young man, given, given enough time and opportunity.
It's B.
It's literally.
Nevermind.
I mean, the first two letters of Bereshit are B.
Right.
They're not think.
They're not plan.
They're not make a structure.
They are B.
A is the possibility of structure.
Look at the dang letter.
The capital.
Right.
It's erect.
There's nothing round in there.
There's no feminine.
It's very masculine.
It points.
It penetrates.
A.
When you say, ah, you're being penetrated.
And the penetration is making ripples in your soul.
When you say, buh, you're encompassing.
Encompassing.
Straight edge and the compass right there.
Right.
Show me a Freemason that knows this.
Show me one.
Bring him out.
Let me talk to him.
I'll talk to him.
Let's go.
Yeah.
We'll have a conversation.
We'll have a conversation.
So I want to read you guys briefly.
One of the outputs from Cryptophone.
This is a mixture of Darkinville's Cat, which is an unimaginable book.
I promise.
There's nothing like it on Earth.
And a book by Clark Ashton Smith.
And I have the whole books, right, are text files.
And Cryptophone is randomly picking words from these two books.
And I haven't touched this, so it's not edited.
I'm just going to get the pure output.
And I'll read it as if I'd written it as a poem.
Here we go.
