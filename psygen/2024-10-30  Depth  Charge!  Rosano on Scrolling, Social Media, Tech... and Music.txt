yeah it's such a pleasure to meet you um likewise I've seen and been very impressed by a lot of
your uh how shall I put it very rich uh content on your Facebook page which is how I came across
you um you're one of those people who has a deep commitment to authentic and intelligent
and creative communication and and I I just love that it's so inspiring especially in the wasteland
of memetic you know effluent that we're commonly exposed to yeah it's kind of funny that you said
that I'm inspired by your Facebook page because that that phrase in itself is kind of like perhaps
surprising in some ways um is it I mean it's of course people can be inspired by Facebook but
maybe we're both you know maybe we have a certain point of view about Facebook so um but also that's
super kind of you to say and I think um yeah I mean I I I would say similar words for some of the stuff
you've put online like you're kind of hacking into the system way of posting and uh just kind of getting
people to see things differently um yeah just really appreciate also what you're doing so um thanks for
for showing and thanks for having this job yeah I mean I think there's um there's an activist aura around
our the way we that you and I each uniquely participate in these mediums if they're even worthy of being
called mediums um because they're so highly and I think largely malignantly curated um by the forces that
uh developed and um uh sort of populated them right so you know I had a uh I had a conversation a few
weeks ago with Sergio Toporek uh Topo who I'll I'll explain in a moment so he he was running a super popular
Facebook page called beware of images and he had about 300 000 subscribers his posts these days get around
10 or 15 views he's been thoroughly throttled by Facebook he's a graphic designer who was using images
to warn us about their danger right which is why why I bring him up right because I think we're um
we're participating in the medium with the spirit of using it yeah trying to try and the way I call
it is trying to catch people where they are but in some sense we are using this medium that perhaps we
both have a certain distaste for as a way to try and meet people wearing those things when I first came
in San Francisco I was working for a man named Mansour Saadi um as a uh computer technician in a printing
house and I was I was very young and he sat me down and told me a story of what had happened in his
country in Iran where IBM had given the computer to the Shah to track dissidents and when the Shah fell
the Ayatollah got a hold of that data and they sent all the people they sent you know students and
professors and um the intelligentsia and artists um in other countries who were you know Iranian in
other countries they sent them a letter essentially saying like come back everything will be forgiven
we'll give you a scholarship no worries just come home you know as soon as you can
and when those people showed up they literally just executed them on the tarmac at the airport
on Moss right they just took them out and Mansour was lucky enough to be sick on the day that he and
his brother were supposed to travel but two of his other brothers were executed and his sister was
imprisoned in the country and this became you know I was very pro computer back in the day I was like
computers are amazing I'm going to do incredible things with this we're going to publish amazing
beautiful intelligent articulate stuff and
it's the future yeah um you're starry-eyed you are excited shiny toys um we feel perhaps everyone
else's enthusiasm about this possible future and yeah at the same time it's there's this other side
which is just kind of horrifying um it's funny how you I don't know what year you were talking about
that you sort of the before point when you had a good impression about computers did it change after
that or were there subsequent okay so that that really um made me think carefully about a lot of
topics that had not yet occurred to me and as a computer technician I started relating with computers
probably in my early what late teens actually uh so that would that would be around 1980 1981 when
computers were just starting to become available to the common people and my primary interests were
in music art and publishing so um I became a a specialist in in printing and publishing over the
years and I watched with fascination the rise of the internet I recall uh in the very early days
having a video conversation with a couple in Australia um and feeling like wow this is this is the dream we
had as children right this is like this is like talking to people from outer space um and I was
super excited but I watched our email uh damaged a lot of relationships because we as humans are not
prepared um cognitively or emotionally for instantaneous communication right it's not we don't we never had
that before and at first I was at that time you would describe it as instantaneous yeah yeah so email
right I send someone an email they get it they respond right and this is before tax right this is way
before tax and I watched I mean I lost a few of my closest relationships this way because I wasn't
thinking thinking carefully enough about the problem of temporality in human communication
um and how it had been and how it was becoming you couldn't write a letter to someone and have them
get it right now yeah so I started to become suspicious uh probably in the late 90s I realized like
hmm something's going wrong here and now I can articulate very I think very sophisticated things about
those problems but back then I was still like what what's the problem here exactly like I can see this
is dangerous but I'm not sure why yeah and I um over time I started to become aware that the presence of
computers in my life was harming me um took time to figure out that my sleep problems might be related
to disturbances in my circadian rhythms caused by constant exposure to blue light
um so yeah and and as uh first cell phones and then smartphones and that stuff developed
I stood back from them very intentionally um I got my first smartphone in I had nothing like that
until 2016 when a job basically required it right so I watched what was going on with other people
and these you know like staring into their hand kind of thing and yeah I have a lot of thoughts about
it but um we're here today partly because of a of a sort of brief video you made about scrolling
and I'd love to hear what inspired you and any other thoughts that you care to share about
the terrain I've covered so far yeah uh stroll uh scrolling so I have the name of my video project
is called strolling so of course I choose a name like scrolling to describe this kind of thing um yeah
the scrolling concept is um just sometimes I use pre-existing words with other connotations to just
describe something that I it's new for me anyway of course I've been scrolling for a long time on a
computer and phone but never called it this now now when I call it scrolling it means I am allowing
myself to be subjected to kind of random things and I'm not really in control of what's going on and
I don't have an end day uh I'm basically just changing the channel um and I don't mean these to
necessarily be criticisms or that one should feel bad when doing these things but just to kind of
not be aware right uh we were also changing this channel on TV perhaps um perhaps without awareness
perhaps really awareness um so so perhaps it's also just not a new thing but yeah my my
I just noticed myself um perhaps uh periodically overwhelmed by some of the things I've seen on
social media and or just kind of transfixed to or uh uh drooling or whatever just like you know
different states but I feel like I I'm not really in control of what's going on and I've known for
a long time but let's say since TikTok came out how many years ago is that maybe three or four years
ago I've known since that time at least that uh there's this thing called TikTok uh and it's
really addictive and everybody's just like scrolling from one video to the next and slowly all of these
other platforms are trying to copy the same thing I never used TikTok actually um I actually didn't
even use Instagram for I deactivated it for like 12 years and I reactivated it in 2022 at the start of
my video project because I wanted to put it on different platforms then all of a sudden I find
myself on this platform again that I tried not to use but yeah so in the last um so even though I
wasn't using this addictive scrolling video medium basically kind of watching it from the outside as
one of the enlightened Twitter users who doesn't need one of those things you know I can just do
text I can just scroll on text I'm so smart and I would just and now I find myself oh okay I'm
actually doing the video thing now uh probably not as much I don't think I I spend my whole day on
it but sometimes I don't realize I passed an hour doing that and I don't I don't I didn't really
want that to happen so um so that was an interesting observation for me perhaps in the last year and
I guess this year like why the scrolling video why now it maybe has to do with just getting the sense
of these cycles where in the last 12 months for various reasons that have to do with let's say
international events I am subjected to something that's like overwhelming and then it affects me
for a long time and then it takes me like maybe a few weeks or a month to feel like okay no I need to
do something that can help me get out of this because I'm actually not helping anybody by being
in the situation if I'm if I'm sad about a situation that's happening somewhere else I end up doing
something that I feel is not actually helping that situation or is it helping myself and so just just
being aware of that and again I don't want to portray this as like a kind of criticism for anybody who
might be in that situation because it's very tricky to navigate these waters but yeah I just kind of
noticed this myself I feel like I have more experience with tech stuff than most of my friends so I
have a way to talk about this you have a certain level of credibility maybe because of my experience with
technology and I try to simplify things and I just felt I wanted to say something that could help people
um and uh and noticing also this pattern if you don't mind me digressing a little longer about this
video um one thing that I've heard many times in the year last year about certain current events it's
like you don't scroll away this is like an instruction that comes from people who make certain
videos don't scroll away you have to see this otherwise maybe you're you're a bad person or whatever
right um or our lighter form just like well we need to look at it here we need to look at it on
Instagram or on scrolling video platform or as I say on the video scrolling meme platform
uh we need to look here because we can't trust like the authoritative sources because they're kind
of corrupted by um interests that are kind of not in your interests uh and I was trying to point out
in the video this subtle thing about how the the fact that it might be true that we can't trust the
mainstream stuff but it doesn't mean that we can trust this stuff automatically and I just wanted
to point that out because it wasn't obvious to me I obviously was totally involved with that um you know
thinking so yeah more or less that's kind of where I was um yeah beautiful there's so much rich terrain
here um it does seem that yes our historical propensity for something we call channel surfing has been
captured by high technology and I think it's ironic and very important to understand that when a product
is called tick tock it's going to change our relationship with time right and fundamentally for
organisms our what we think of as our health or our capacity to heal our capacity to grow and to have
deep relationships and so on these are prime these are primarily founded on synchronization
right when we come together when we eat food when we say things when we don't when we go for a walk
you know when all these things when we fall asleep and all of these things they comprise the
synchronization and if you watch nature very closely which I do I adore every living thing I love
this planet um just so deeply and passionately and I've been like that since I was a little kid
then even though I became fascinated by machines eventually I saw like wait a minute um I think we
have too many machine and then wait we have too many kinds of machines and then wow we're just we're
making like a billion packets of ketchup per second right I hear people talking about the population
problem with humans like there's a billion of us it's really scary but nobody's talking about like
how many mustard packets were there's no one thinking about the object population right and and those
objects offload entropy into living systems and I'm very confused about if there was any forethought
about this at all how would we how would we respond to the entropy that's offloaded by machines into
our lives into our minds into our relationships and perhaps unlike you I I want to very much highlight
the cautionary aspect here and I think there's something else that's really important which is
that I think it's dangerous to tell people what not to do because it does it's not very helpful so
most of the time you have to give them something better to do right show them here here do this instead
um whenever you're having this feeling and you want to just scroll you know call your friend right
talk to a human being get together make some food to like together go with people go for a walk in the
living places right something like this um I suppose it could be that easy I mean some I feel often I'm at
a loss for what to say specifically in the technical technical technological realm um and the nerd part of
something wants to say oh just use RSS feeds or just read blogs or just you know this kind of agency
go to reddit yeah oh reddit yeah I mean but but it's not like I can't really tell people to do that there
isn't really a like a a straightforward way and unfortunately also sometimes the straightforward
way involves you using like some big tech company having all your data and stuff so I I'm I'm just
comfortable with what to suggest actually nature is probably a great suggestion and I feel as great
as it as great as I think it is I think a lot of people might interpret it as kind of flippant like
oh you don't get what I'm what I'm addicted to actually if you're suggesting that I take a walk you
know come on it's just like this is uh this is dealing with my this is changing my nervous system I
need something like I don't know so um I feel at a loss for what to suggest actually I love the idea of
replacing it um unfortunately yeah and it is our need to use these things is hijacked uh everything
is happening on these platforms our way to keep in touch with friends is happening there um sometimes
even work or important pseudo professional things that we need to kind of keep up with what's going
on like that's through the same channel so it's being exploited to keep us there and so
it's harder and harder to just remove things I try and just say at least maybe try and use something
else for one thing and we just start that way you know one at a time but uh yeah I'd love to hear if
you have like things that you think people have received well as alternatives to these things
that's a good question um by the way like uh I'm not I want to be really clear you know we're
exploring here and I I love I love to I'm so glad to have you here and to hear your perspective and I'm
not trying to um like dictate what I think people should do um because that would be you know sort
of tyrannical and idiotic um I've just noticed that when something deleterious is going on
humans don't tend to respond well to being told not to do something and so if we can if it's possible
to think of something better to do and I have some I have some models of um social network systems that
could blow the existing stuff right out of the water and give us back the capacity to actually
collaborate and stuff like this whether or not I'll ever chase them is side question but I remember um
so yeah TikTok is changing temporality and
other all of these platforms change our experience of time dramatically it's part of why I think they're
addicting um I recall I just wanted to mention this little anecdote I was looking out my window one
day perhaps I don't know 18 years ago or something and I saw a young mother walking with her perhaps
four-year-old daughter and the mom staring into her phone and the daughter's on the other side of her
um daughter's holding her hand and daughter's like looking up at her mom you know like wide-eyed and
watching her and the mom is completely on the phone and then the child gets a funny look on her face
and then she she holds up her empty hand and just looks at it right
there's something really important you said um these are the what we're exposed to on social media and
the idea that we are obligated that somehow our attention to atrocities is transformative of those
atrocities all right so pay attention because bad things are happening and you need to know about
it um I had friends who were vegan um more power to them love that you know love that idea uh what's
the word vegan right vegan oh yeah they only they only plant matter right and you know they would some
of them a few of them a few of them would post constant streams of like slaughterhouse videos and
stuff like this and uh there's another problem here like two actually that I just want to broach
um the first is I don't think humans are equipped to think about the world to think about things
going on far away that we can't affect but we can feel right for a very tiny part of human history this
has even been possible it was impossible to think about the world say a thousand years ago or 2 000
years ago right there's no chance of it happening you weren't getting news from China or Ukraine or
South America you had no idea what was going on in other places and most of your cognition and your
problem-solving ability and your vigilance for threats and opportunities was highly limited to
a very local scope with people you actually knew I think um so that's one thing I wanted to point out
and the other thing is like apparently people seem some people have the impression the posting about
something rotten or malignant or terrifying on Facebook is somehow a form of action that
that goes to solve that problem and I don't think that's what's going on in fact I would argue
that our capacity to post about something is actually replacing our capacity to act to form
up together and act now it's not only replacing it it's not the only thing going on we can use social
media to form up and act together around problems and that does successfully happen but I think for for
many many people this display behavior replaces what might otherwise motivate us to become involved
whatever you're I'd love to hear your thoughts uh so I'm just trying to write down my other thought
but can you just repeat the last sentence yeah I'm concerned that our display behavior on social media
for many of us not not everybody right these are very complex matters those are trees with many
branches right but the thing I'm concerned about is that display behavior steals from our motivation to
actually form up together and respond intelligently to situations it's not the only thing that happens
but it's a common thing that happens okay um yeah this has a lot to do also with why I posted what I
posted but I try not to really talk about things in terms of this activist mentality but of course
there's there's a layer there which I am thinking about and there's a couple things um well I'll just go to
the point which is yeah the the posting of uh atrocities as a way to
get people's attention that something's happening and I guess something something something solve the
problem right like uh it's sort of like you know question mark question mark profits like um
um I don't think it's completely disconnected from solving the problem in some way it's just it has
to do with the part of like getting people to know what's going on I suppose like we need people to know
what's going on and to get them involved maybe so it's kind of a logical thing to do but the organizing
of that interest and energy I think doesn't happen automatically and certainly won't happen just in
the comments I mean it can but uh it seems the way I think about it is it's um um I'm not used to
saying this on the internet but I'm just gonna go with it so uh yeah I think it's disconnected with
disconnected from how power works so it's not we're not voting you know like when we
we pay attention to these atrocities and social media the amount of engagement that is gets is
not a determining factor in how policy government policy changes I think we understand that but
there's there's some maybe disconnect there look I think what people were imagining is that by posting
it you get people feeling angry about this and then at some point everybody's just going to come
together and we're going to demand and it's and it's going to become this big kind of demonstration
or protest somehow and perhaps that would work if there was like a critical mass in the real world
so like somehow that social media engagement translated to let's say even half the the number
of people engaged like on the street somehow uh or on the street in the sense of like maybe they go
strike or maybe they you know they contribute in whatever way that that would help that cause like
they'd have to figure that out and everything but uh okay look if that happened like maybe this would
be a useful strategy but I don't think that's what's been happening um I might there might be a
there might be some instance of this working in this way where somebody posted about something and
they're involved in the changes right uh maybe we need more of the stories but it seems like we have
too much information already and there's too many atrocities and everybody's just kind of getting too
much horrifying information and we're kind of paralyzed from it and we don't know what to
respond to first and then we don't do it and then we're just we're just not going anywhere um
that seems more like what what's happening and the other thing I wanted to say
uh that that's kind of functional about the atrocity posting is that sometimes it's not
actually for everyone even though people post into this into the into the pool of what's going on
into the feed and there's maybe an idea that like everybody needs to see this but the functional result
is that the people who will see it are basically people who are on the same page already so you're not
going to cross your bubbles by posting that thing um you're probably not going to surprise I mean
somebody might be like oh wow I didn't know that was going on okay but I think for the way things
are happening now there's so much of this stuff that I think basically people are talking to their
in-group and that's actually fine it's totally fine for people who are passionate about a specific
thing to talk to the people who are also passionate about that specific thing but I don't think that's
everybody and I I hope that they're not confused that they think they're talking to everybody when
they're just talking to their group I I heard a great phrase which is kind of a summation of this
like um demonstrations protests like demonstrations on the street are basic it's basically networking
you know um you you're not going to change somebody's mind over there right the people who
are there are probably already on the same page as you and so anyway everything I'm saying here in the
point is essentially um it's okay to preach to your choir and you do need to preach to your choir to
build this kind of momentum within your group uh it just maybe should be clear that you realize that's
what you're doing yeah yeah I mean there's so much going on um now because we have these constant streams
of mimetic information and the the um what would I call them
um the uh the sort of monolithic corporations that are feeding them to us right are psychographizing
us purportedly for the sake of advertising which I think is hilarious right advertising has become
some kind of a weird um demonic force in in human cognition and the infosphere and
um um but they're psychographizing us meaning we're being analyzed and and um uh we're being
segregated into groups right by in within these corporations and um I guess a couple of the other
things that stand out to me is when humans are exposed to media like this they often undergo sort of a
crisis of authorization which in the United States right now authorization right whether I authorize
this piece of media or I object to it or I have another perspective or this is what I just ignore
this stuff right there's an authorization sort of um process that that people undergo
and it transforms their thought um a great example is your song teddy bear instant authorization from me
right I saw that and I was like oh my god this beautiful man his heart listen to this every child
will understand like what a beautiful like so this is what I'm talking about in a way although I'm really
singing the praises of your song teddy bear which I think is just sweet and amazing um
um could I ask what you said because you used you linked it to this authorization concept
I imagine that's something that happens before you encounter something or before you choose to watch
something but are you saying you allowed yourself to watch it before you watched it or or did you know
what happened was like I came across it somehow and and I hit play immediate authorization in my
consciousness yes yes this yeah right what's what's the cue because you just push play but you didn't
hear much like how do you after yeah you're right a few if it probably took like 45 seconds of listening
um and I was just enchanted okay you gave it a chance and then you were like okay this is wow okay cool
exactly but um in as someone who studies cognition and is very interested in language it's clear to me
that when we hear words at all uh many of us most of us perhaps undergo a process where either we we
authorize the speaker or we don't and who is the speaker on the internet right these are people we don't
know and so often what we undergo is um a process of authorizing the the message as we understand it
right or or objecting or being critical or just fawning right thirst traps for example that's you
know that's instant authorization um for you know for some audience segment so yeah a
huge part of uh what goes on in human cognition has to do with authorization and hierarchy right and
part of why we're in the United States right now in a crisis where we could elect a very strange human
being to rule us is simply because that person um objects to uh what we what we call it systemic
authority fundamental way and that objection captures millions of angry people who can't stand the idea
that there's any kind of authority other than what they think or what you know what they object to or
whatever their pet uh you know anger triggers are right so he captures that very effectively and this is
the only reason i mean this is the only reason that i think it's the it's a primary reason why there's
a danger of that person being elected love to hear anything that these thoughts spark in you or
uh you can have something uh you can keep going if you have more to say about it well um what is it that
what captivates you what do you find entertaining or pleasing or nourishing when you're what are some of the
beautiful things that you appreciate about the content that you encounter and what do you seek out
when you're intentionally uh playing with the media yeah
yeah i actually had this sensation of productivity when i first let's say like six months after i started my
video project and unlocked my instagram and i started posting to instagram and about six yeah six eight
months after i was kind of on there regularly and i i never really got into the algorithmic feed i was
always very careful about that i was like i don't want to turn into numbers like people stuck in
sucking your bones and um yeah so i always avoided that of course the odd thing that slipped through
somehow because everything's designed to provoke you in that way um but i i i had the sensation of
productivity because there were a couple things that i found a couple of creators that i found which
were like totally uh where where i wanted to be or they were just kind of giving me what i wanted at
the time uh mostly around movement so i was really into capoeira at that time uh this brazilian
martial arts dance thing and the people doing that or people just doing movement flexibility training
this kind of thing um somebody talking about like food saving like minimizing waste with growth with
uh organic and stuff and um not not too many let's say like a handful of things um
um and i thought oh how nice you know i just get like one of these things every now and then i don't
really need all of them but like every it's useful enough and i'm glad to have this information and
enough of those things that sort of transported into my real world perhaps my my movement practice my
dance dancing or like it's helped me figure something out or even this like this sort of
psychology stuff like i don't pay too much attention to that but there's there's some ideas in there
that like okay yeah that that's really sensible uh like i notice i'm doing that maybe i change it
whatever maybe it's changed something in my relationships so these odd random nuggets have
come out of that stream uh and it's never prompted me to like find as much of it as i can i just kind of
take what comes and i go back to my day and you know i try to manage that that that time i spend
in the stream whether it's algorithmic or not and so yeah i've been grateful for those things there are
some recipes that i found which are just kind of fun to make for you know partner i was trying to
cook for her and uh because i i had this phase where i wasn't doing that a lot and i just felt like
i really want to do i want to make stuff for you because she was taking care of me so much and
so it was nice to have these recipes that are um in accordance with her dietary restrictions and
i also get to feel like i'm practicing cooking and i feel more agency and whatever so all these things
that they're just little things right it's not i can't say it's any specific thing but there's
enough of these things to give me a sensation of yeah initially i said productivity because i felt like
cool i'm not spending my whole day scrolling but i get a cool thing every now and then
and great you know i can keep i'm still actually quite in the real world and actually that was
even the same time where i made this video talking about how i'm not even i'm kind of just like said
detached from online life because my twitter life was sort of in hiatus for some time because i was
living with this collective in berlin and my social cup was saturated for like three months i was having
everything was just happening in person so i didn't need to look at my phone for anything i'd need
to send a message to anybody because it was all just kind of there a bit overwhelming but but i
found myself not wanting to even look at twitter mastodon i had this newsletter that i used to write
and i didn't it's like i was asking an older version of myself to write this it felt forced so i just
kind of stopped and i even made a video about this called detaching from online life and and yet at the
same time every now and then i would get some of these nuggets from the stream but it was all kind of
management manageable so that was kind of cool and i don't know like at what points i got to
where i was maybe um more recently but uh yeah it's uh there was some some some loss of that
deliberation to to manage it yeah um anyway but yeah to answer your question it's just uh kind of random
stuff um oh yeah so another big part of it which i didn't mention yeah i keep saying i was a twitter
person so let's say for the last i don't know i got a twitter account in like 2009 i think or like
really early and probably been using it for like over 10 years let's say um and i'm into programming
and a lot of my bubble on twitter is into that tech world there's tech topics um i yeah i'm very kind of
uh programming your mastodon work uh the transformation
you were getting back to something uh yeah spark i you know i just want to say i was just trying to
describe how much i was in this twitter world you know and oh yeah yeah the the friends on instagram
is where i was going okay thank you okay so i was previously using social media for let's say like
10 years mostly on what what i call public social media so like twitter blogs um newsletter like this
kind of broadcast medium um i have a certain certain bubbles that are there shouldn't talk
about topics about technology or like data uh data sovereignty um self-esteem whatever different tech
topics every now and then i would talk about like organizing information or life or whatever but
i had this kind of this range of things that i would do mostly when i was online and almost none of
it had to do with my friends actually on public social media it was all stuff i was interested in it was all
interest based and so i one of the things i was grateful for and this was to answer your other
question is when i started using instagram my friends were there and it's mostly my friends
actually i wasn't following things out of interest those nuggets that i got were just these random
things and eventually maybe i followed a few creators that i didn't know but most of it was actually my
friends and i i appreciated uh yeah just the way that people received my my video project the strolling
project because they were it kind of meant something to them or they knew the people who were there
and it just felt like this this social experience um that um seemed to be a healthy extension of what was
happening in the real world and i never really experienced that on twitter because i'd never engaged
with my friends on twitter my friends wouldn't use twitter because they're not into those tech
topics or they don't understand this like short form so that was an interesting feeling also that
okay cool i'm getting these nuggets and i'm feeling actually more connected to my friends somehow this
is great um and someone later told me to you know that instagram is great even just for the stories
thing because you get to see what people are up to and then it disappears in 24 hours there's no guilt
about catching up over i had all these perspectives about how it's nice to catch up with people it's
nice to see what people are doing my friends are doing i probably have a lot of them on facebook but i
don't i don't have this kind of sensation over there i don't know why um but yeah it was nice to have
that and i guess it still is to know um what my friends are up to but
i think i just became aware that there's a radical difference between what we experience on facebook
and what happens on instagram because there's no i mean i'm not a big instagram user i have an account
i almost never touch it um but i can go to instagram and go to someone's instagram and i can just see
like images or stories of what's been going on and i don't see anything else right i just see that
just see what they what they're doing you know and you can go to a person's profile on facebook
but on facebook you got the news feed quote unquote which is a very ironically titled situation i think
so yeah that's that's interesting and i and i can see why that might that might feel
you'll human much more human and relational
i'm curious about so when you talked about productivity were you talking about creating content
i was talking about feeling enriched in some way that carries into other aspects of my life
without trying to the platform somehow oh i see and even if i stopped paying attention to any of those
things today i'd still feel like okay cool i have some tools right so it's it's as if um you're very
you're curating your exposure to the medium and you're being selective about things that actually enrich
your experience or your knowledge or your capabilities you know um you mentioned capoeira
i study tai chi and have for 40 years so movement is an important part of my life
and there's all kinds of things where i've got some little problem or something or i have a question
that i want to solve and i can go to the internet and basically you know almost every time or even if
i'm worried about something right something different happened that i don't know what it means say with my
health or or you know any kind of thing and i can go there and there's a problem in that um if we're
if we're trying to solve if we're afraid i think if maybe i'll just speak for myself if i'm afraid of
something right and then i go to the internet that can that can quickly effloresce into like like i can
get spun up right and i've had people come to me who've been spun up by the internet and i've got to talk
them down and go like okay let's start at step one we're just going to go steps one and two here
together for a few minutes and never mind step 50 yet you know what are your thoughts about this
well i just love that framing of being afraid and going to the internet as opposed to maybe other ways
i like the idea that you might realize you're afraid and maybe not go to the internet i don't
um never never thought to think about in those terms but i think that's super helpful and yeah i
think what i was saying in my scrolling video is really it's not even specifically about scrolling
it's just maybe like watching yourself and understanding how you engage with these things
and the first scrolling is one dimension of that but what you're saying is that it's another it has to
do with that as well and just mindful use of these things and uh i call i said the container
is poisonous in my video you know we're using this poisonous medium which is scrolling but we can
still use it somehow um if we're strategic and hopefully we don't hurt ourselves in the process
and yeah i think that that's what it's about it's just trying to be conducive somehow despite the
circumstances i was i was really impressed with your video because it was very concise
and coherent right and very human and you didn't come off like an activist um quote unquote right the
sort of flag waving like base you know you shouldn't be bad people or dinner we didn't come off that way
at all and sometimes perhaps um i may be guilty of that uh but it's refreshing to see someone who's um
um whose perspective is sort of broader more inclusive uh very down to earth very human
and from what i've seen of your your media and your i mean i primarily primarily know you through
facebook um you seem to be someone with a deep cons not a deep concern you embody heartful authenticity
with other people and you bring people into your life and you you converse with them about matters
that are very deep and important to our daily lives to education music to thinking about our situation
and sometimes even social media i saw one of the uh i saw a clip where you were speaking with a young
woman and she was talking about the importance of not going viral which is just what a brilliant
like that that really captured me because i was like wow that's like everyone else seems to have the
opposite concern how can i get more audience share right now you know wow yeah she was someone i think
at the time she probably had four to five thousand followers right and at that point she's talking
about how to not go viral because she's perhaps understood something about the the issues that can
arise from that and um i i don't know if she still has that perspective but yeah i also think that's
fascinating and i i i've also i mean yeah everybody's kind of pulled to want the number to go up
so it's nice to it it's one thing to hear somebody say it who perhaps doesn't have and this is such a
silly um metric but like yeah someone who maybe doesn't have that many followers to say that kind
of idea um and perhaps we would all take that equally seriously hopefully we would um but uh i i'm just
fascinated because i i see how she posts on twitter and she has this like following and they're super
interested and uh it's just really it's really buzzing over there and and uh and to hear her
say this but i thought was just interesting so yeah i appreciate what you're saying about
um me or my projects and it's very generous of you to have this that's also quite striking to
like considering we haven't really met um in a kind of face-to-face this is our first time talking
yeah yeah and then you have this kind of meeting which i i would i would hope that's how people
receive me um i mean it's how you it it it's okay the aura of your of your presence in
in those videos in in the video i saw on scrolling it's not um okay so my my sort of primary game
is as a creative intellectual right so i'm always using sophisticated language and i'm talking about
you know problems with human cognition or technology or society or whatever right but you're doing
something much when i when i see your your um the media you create it's very human and it's very
it's charmingly um it just draws you in in a heartful way and that i want to just say something about
that when i listen for example to teddy bear it was like medicine for my soul right you're making not
you know you're making something really beautiful within your it's very clear that your heart is in
it and you're not there for some it's not like you have an agenda right i mean we all none of us would
create anything if we were not if we're not motivated but authenticity just rings in everything that i see you
do and that's so beautiful and uh nourishing and reassuring i i just i really celebrate that about
what you're up to appreciate it um i have two things i could say here uh just about teddy bear
because if you tie teddy bear to authenticity i feel like i could also haven't said this to anybody i
think but i think i could say this um publicly so to speak um my partner who i wrote the song for
told me that of course and she was overwhelmed because she's never received something like that
and uh but she was so baffled that she's like oh it's it's like pages from my diary like because
that's that's basically what actually happened it's not like i'm dreaming something in a way um
or it feels very real to her you know so to say authentic real okay i mean i'm not
trying to be too imaginative there because the the reality of our our promise is like that in our
connection so um so it's interesting to to sense authenticity in those terms um the other thing i
wanted to say uh is about simple language and perhaps it's important to um sorry yeah so simple language uh
uh it's true and i and i do deliberately try to do my videos in a simpler language uh i don't i don't
force the my guests or the people that i record with to speak differently um i encourage them if they
can to try and like simplify if they can but i don't force them to i i say you can be as you are
i i yeah i do have an interest in not leaving people out i know that terminology and jargon can
it's it's like again you end up speaking to your your crowd to the people who know those things and
that's totally fine and i i find myself always trying to like break out of bubbles or reach across
the line and like whatever so in this way i i find it more i consider it more strategic to speak with
simple language but i don't know for sure that it's actually working but i think it does i hope it is
we'll see um but an interesting dimension to say about that is uh each video that i've made of strolling
i have always considered my father uh receiving it um because he's obviously in a different time than
me and i'm sorry in a different generation than me um he's not he kind of tunes out with like
in the past he passed away recently but like my process with strolling is to always consider him and
how he would receive whatever has happened whether it's me talking or that somebody talking
um so i always wanted to make sure that i wouldn't lose him uh and of course it's not guaranteed i'm
sometimes in the idea but i was surprised that how sometimes he was brought in to certain people
that are quite the opposite of these inclinations politically or uh whatever whatever ways right um
so those things i would consider successful um that you know maybe you have some kind of
stereotypical stereotypical crazy artist type personality who's very free and wavy that are
done and somehow he's if if i had presented that person in that way
as a kind of exotic or i don't know uh unrecognizable strangeness then perhaps he wouldn't have been able
to get it or like oh i there's nothing i could do about that i don't know anything about art i don't
relate to this i don't whatever but he was drawn into one of the stories that this person suggested and
ended up watching some of the videos etc but this has been a very important thing for me and and
now even though my father's passed away i think i will still try to do the same thing because for me
him of course i would love him to understand my project and care about it i don't expect him to but
would have been great and and then he did and i even recorded with him and i showed some videos with him
but i the way i've seen it is that if i can reach him then there are other people
perhaps like him or not like him but it means i can reach
other kinds of people who maybe are have similar inclinations
i'm so glad that you shared that particular concern and awareness um this is exactly the kind
of thing i was hoping to hear right like something about what motivates your your way of working
with media and and how you communicate with with people online and that's just beautiful i also lost
my father pretty recently um and i i i'm taking a page from you on this one because
one of the things that you're saying is like i think it's really important to highlight
if you do the same dance every time you're going to be dancing to the same people every time
right if you do the dance that you're you just you're used to doing this one dance and that's the
dance that you got attention for doing especially on on the internet right because attention
it's hard to avoid the power of it um and it can literally mean new opportunities right so if your
audience grows dramatically now you have opportunities we would imagine that you didn't
have before and some threats too right there's some downside um so most i i think it's it's very
common for people to just want to grow their audience you know if they make stuff but i think what
i'm hearing from you is something really beautiful and i mean it's exactly what i'd kind of expect well
no it's not true i'd have to yeah i'd have to have been prescient to expect it it's just that you're
communicating with with your audience with the same kind of heartful attention that you might
you know employ with someone who's in the same room with you
ideally they are like right ideally you would feel like you're just sitting in front of us um
or whatever but yeah yeah that's actually how i felt when i watched your video on scrolling which
we have to we have to make a distinction between strolling and scrolling and these microphones don't
always um transmit the consonant sounds as clearly as we might like scrolling as in walking scrolling as
in social network yeah i mean most of the videos i made i made while walking right so i'm just out
walking in the world for four or five hours and i'll take two of those hours and you're the champion
stroller man you have a whole youtube channel with like hour-long videos and you're strolling and
talking i watched some of some of the videos it's great yeah thank you yeah i love it because you
know i'm kind of similar to you in how i use media um i'll i'll let the algorithm play with me a little
bit but i don't sign in so right and i've had um especially recently over the past few months
i've made very deep connections with a couple of young people who were watching my content
and and decided like i want to talk to this guy and um so that's something you know and also yes
i'm critical and i'm concerned about facebook and youtube and google and all of these things i think
honestly we need to build something better that gives us the benefit of what we call analytics
instead of delivering that to corporations that's the simple version
benefit of analytics yeah so we're being analyzed and psychographized by these corporations
for sure right for market segmentation if nothing else okay you mean we become the beneficiaries of
what is analyzed so we learn about ourselves okay we're about so we're about to enter a phase where
these cameras and microphones are going to know very complex things about our physiology right they're
going to read pupil dilation they're going to read moisture on the skin they're going to read heartbeat
very simple toys like things that go on the xbox can already do some of this stuff a long time ago
right so if we're going to go there we should go there before they do is basically my idea we should
do this in a way that that keeps that data very protected so that only we have it and we can use it
to become more intelligent together and to actually solve problems in the world that we care about
to organize to learn together to teach each other to sort of raise each other up this is this is my
my toy idea what do you think well i mean it's great uh i think it's it's
i don't think anybody would argue that it should be any other way it's uh it's it's wonderful
i what i wanted to say earlier was like are you suggesting that we try to do it faster and the
forces that are creating those things but but maybe a better way to ask this is
perhaps what you're describing if it wasn't obvious to a lot of people who are dissatisfied with
technology whether they're in the tech world or out in the tech world if it wasn't obvious to them
already over the last let's say 20 years um sorry if if it was obvious to people and they wanted it and
i'm sure people have wanted it why haven't we been able to go there somehow why do you think okay so
there's this there are really weird forces that influence um how technology gets implemented in our
lives i'll give you one simple example uh we're using a browser technology right like like whatever
browser i don't know what browser you favor and we don't have to announce that here because that's
a very personal choice i mean yeah knowing which browser but um so we're using a browser technology
that essentially hasn't changed since 1997. i could show you a browser technology that would look like
it's from another universe where every time you touch that thing you would get smarter and everyone
around you would get smarter we're using the internet like the index of a book that's the
dumbest idea ever and there hasn't been a single disruptor that came along and said hey wait a minute
there's this entire manifold of information but we're going at it like the index of a book
what that's not how our minds work that's not how our creativity works that's not how our emotions
work and so the problem is one of the problems that i think is really important and i won't sing
about this too long is that our minds emulate the technologies we're exposed to so we need to build
technologies that encourage our minds to blossom and our relationships to blossom and perhaps even our
dreams right our visions of what it might be to be human together or even when we're alone and i mean
we could be dreaming in data through the same interface that we're scrolling through a list of
that what are we doing and google hasn't come up with something better we're using the same tech from
1999 with a little bit of you know slight improvements right so just notice that in terms
of the development of the internet and you're you're a tech guy right you you code don't you you code
yeah i'm a coder right i was coding a long time ago i mean i don't do it much these days i code these
days i'm more interested in coding cognition but um so again do you program yeah yeah or even just um
shining a light on what's going on so it's it's very it's fascinating to me that over nearly 30 years
years there's been no development of browser tech right none i mean we're still doing the same damn
thing go ahead yeah i don't know either i'm gonna push back just just to make sure we're on the same
page and perhaps anybody else who maybe is less technical might not understand that but the way i hear
what you're saying it's obvious browsers have changed because now we can do video conferencing
and web rtc and locations that are not but i think what you're saying is the paradigm hasn't changed
like maybe yeah not specifically okay yeah granted yeah yeah granted that's true what i'm specifically
saying is that the technology we call a web browser that is the primary interface to the information on the
internet is garbage and it hasn't much changed in 30 years and similarly i mean we have a worse
problem with our social systems right like governments and you know the military and the
military industrial complex and this kind of thing we're still using code from like i don't know 1850
right we're building unimaginably sophisticated machines but we're not yet commonly
building intelligent societies and on a small scale you can find instances of people doing that right
i'm sure you've had experience of that you you mentioned having lived communally and that's a very
intimate situation where people are you know they're they're being human together right in a meaningful
way i like to think so all i'm trying to point out is there are some it's very strange what happens
it's almost like the building of a skyscraper and once that thing exists we'll just i'll just pick
facebook as as an example it tends to purvey over you know over some span of time and i mean has someone
had a better idea i haven't seen anything very interesting myself maybe you're aware of some things
yeah this was my question to you in some sense because you described yourself as being critical
about technology since like 80s 90s or like before even the internet maybe so or before let's say 19
and you've seen waves of technology
uh so yeah you've observed how we got to where we are now let's say that way
it and i'm sure people have had great ideas and i'm curious what
why you would suggest that any kind of greater idea hasn't happened i think you've been alluding to
that with like you're affected by the technologies that we subject ourselves to or um our cognition
emulates features of the technologies we're exposed to right and what are you trying to say with that
we wanted something different but we kept using the older stuff and as you say we haven't changed
ourselves in 30 years and so we're still kind of stuck because we're not changing the main technology
i mean yes yes so and again i'm speaking specifically of the web browser right the
primary interface which i think of as the primary interface to the internet but actually this thing
is the primary interface to the internet now right web browsers are like who sits who sits behind the
browser i'm a dinosaur right i'm 60 years old nobody's sitting behind a browser well some people are
um but we could do that so much differently and nobody has and i find that shocking so what all i'm
trying to say is that it's clear to me from observing the the developmental history of the internet that
some things get stuck some things get stuck and they become very sticky over time and it takes
it takes often decades for someone to come up with a better idea and perhaps the reason that nobody's
come up with a better web browser is simply because this is a more attractive target
i want to believe that many people have had great ideas oh i believe that yeah i believe that and
perhaps it hasn't we haven't we maybe we don't have the environment to support those kinds of ideas
because what tends to get pushed forward has to do with what can get investors a return on their
investment it seems like that's basically how the tech world works you want it you have an idea we
pitch it to investors and if they like it or they think they can make money by selling something in the end
then they'll give you some they'll give you a loan and then you go and do the thing but you always
you always have to make sure it can get them to the channel so when things are shaped that way when
every idea has to be shaped that way it becomes very challenging to do something like what you
proposed where every time you touch it you become more conscious more whatever as a human like that's
not inherently profitable maybe or or perhaps it could be and maybe it hasn't been explained that way but
i feel like that has to do with why technology is the way it is as well i think um part of that is the
dominance of advertising and and um consumerism in the equation all right that's how you make money
how do you make money you make money by advertising or selling yourself right
um now i could i can certainly show a model of ways to um produce value money by doing other
things i don't think that's as radical as it sounds but mostly advertising and products dominate
the the what the development uh context yeah now i'm just curious um we i want to maybe shift away
a little bit from this idea that i like to play with a lot and by the way i've had this idea for
almost 30 years so it's ancient i've been sitting on this forever right it's the thing i call the
knowledge now it's just a way of using technology all technologies differently
and i'm surprised that nobody by this time that nobody's really come up with something resembling
it and probably someone has and like my slice of the pie of people who do things is very small and
i just don't see in that little slice right that others have have had similar ideas or maybe you're
even developing products but uh what what got you into coding and what do you code
uh what got me into coding was a friend of mine when i was in high school and he showed me actually
i what what made me care about anything related to this topic was my friend's signature on the msn
messenger chat application uh this is like icq or something you have a signature
yeah his name is angelo and he had as a signature x angelo or zangelo.com i thought oh that's cool
like i thought only companies could do that and then he's explaining oh you can buy one of these things
and then you do some html and make website so it started as this very innocent thing like oh i like
the idea that i can have a name um so yeah and then 15 years later but still keeping up with that
um i had about i was doing my own iphone apps for about 10 years that's uh creating an app where
you slow down the music change the key etc i was working with another developer on that for almost
half the time and when i did it myself for another half of the time but basically in this ios ecosystem
mostly like tools for musicians for myself because i was studying music i was studying classical music in
school and i was trying to get into jazz and improvised music and like learn the solo from the recording
things like that learn from recordings short and i wanted something that i could use to slow things
down and all of the other ones that were out there were kind of ugly or they just didn't work that i
wanted to and i was kind of opinionated about how something like that could look um so yeah that was
something quite significant for me in terms of um yeah just helping me realize that i could make like
a real app and and also i was making some money from that from the app store because people were buying
it when uh after apple's 30 permission i got enough that was useful to have been paid some bills um and
then i decided to pull out of the app store uh in 2023 which is last year because i i'm a bit nervous
about how they're trying to control everything and i don't want to rely on that as a source of income and
simultaneously i also got excited about the web the open web web apps you can also take a website
or web app and just put it on your phone you don't have to download anything um i like that everybody's
welcome in that sphere it doesn't matter if you have a phone a computer a tablet linux microsoft
whatever browser you might be using in this moment uh it's all good it's all welcome and i like how how
open that pod is and uh and i don't have to ask permission i don't have to send my app to the police so
that they can verify it that it doesn't contain any explosives before like whatever and wait two
weeks for the privilege so um excuse my cynicism about the app store but yeah uh yeah i got into
doing these web apps uh tried making money off of those it's a bit more tricky because there's no
buy button there's no app store um now i'm leaning towards just giving everything away for free and
maybe either make money other ways or maybe just trying to change my relationship with money
uh i'm also now uh coding and this may be more of a past tense although i still i still engage with
it every now and then but a bit less in the last year i would say um specifically since my father passed
with i've started actually a lot of different things and um yeah i find myself now kind of
uncertain about where to put my energies in the programming stuff because of how it becomes changing with
respect to ai and language models i don't know if apps or even a web app or even a website is going
to be a thing that we engage with five years from now or ten years from now it may not even you may
just end up typing or saying something and then whatever you need happens i mean there may not need
to be this kind of cluster interface so i have some open questions about that that i don't know so
currently i'm a bit far further from coding than i was but i still have to fix my own stuff every now
and then so i'm i'm going back in brilliant um yeah i'm also a musician uh so all the things you talked
about they all they all make sense to me um what was the first language you coded in
uh oh um php if we're talking like not javascript and um i mean isn't it in a as someone who's
fascinated by language and cognition um my own experience of coding was like discovering sort of
a genie in a bottle right i could i could cause all these amazing things inside a machine um i'd
love to hear anything you care to share about your early experience with it and how it's changed and
how it is now wow well that's like 15 years so um i'll try to excuse me i'll try to be concise um
um when it started i've let's say for the first half maybe even i don't know like first 40 percent of
it i don't uh there is that sensation of wow i made the computer do something and it's kind of magical
and it really fed into my kind of obsessive organizational tendencies like everything is
like it's like it's like exactly exactly exactly like to the pixel to the precision it's super
yeah exactly exactly to a nice level um or even more precise like it's just i love that precision
somehow um so i that was probably enough to draw me into creating all kinds of things i think in
the beginning i was mostly just creating websites actually i wouldn't even actually i haven't even
called what i did programming until very recently but like um yeah i was making websites and then i
got into like making my own log content management system read entries from the database show that
this kind of stuff i could never actually figure out how to do iphone programming because it was
like a different paradigm i guess it's actually technically an older thing than the web stuff web
stuff is from the 90s iphone stuff is like technically based out of the 80s and so i i couldn't
like figure it out like five times and that's what i ended up um finding someone helping with that
um eventually i did figure that out uh it was also a great process to work with this person and
like we collaboratively like
ended up somewhere like it's it wasn't just me specifying set like i would specify something and
then i would get feedback and actually this is not option a is what you want is technically
possible but it would take a week whereas we can just use the standard built-in thing and then it's
done in an hour and like we talk about these different trade-offs and so that was an interesting
process as well to not really be involved in the programming but being somehow informed by it through
my um collaborating colleague and when we uh yeah did that for 10 years um
um and i guess the later and later it gets it becomes more and more like gosh why does it take
so much work to get this thing to do what i want to do i have to type so much it's like
and then you yeah the computer does exactly what you told it to so you something's wrong
and you don't understand why and it's always your fault because you didn't because it does exactly
what you said and it's kind of brutal and how it does that um so unforgiving let's say um yeah and
i guess i still there's still some
magic in it or there's still something pleasant about it but uh more and more i get a sense like
actually if i didn't have to do this programming and i could just use the thing uh i would rather
just have that i've been saying that for like 10 years also so um now perhaps with ai apps will just
happen um and at the moment you still need to be a developer to deal with their mistakes but like
i don't know anyway whether it's that or whether it's some other way like i i think
um yeah it'd be nice to do less talking to machines
yeah i came to a similar conclusion myself um some what maybe 20 years ago after
what i was in it pretty heavily for 20 years um i guess i first coded in basic
i learned some c um mostly i was interested in um music and games those two those two things
but the the concept of coding radically transformed my understanding of the nature of language
because now you have tokens that actually cause events to take place right and that felt that was
a heady you know that was a heady experience in the beginning right to just to create an application
and then interact with the application i created and it transforms reality i mean now there's a thing in
the universe that wasn't there yesterday right even some of the first games i wrote or whatever i'm
my very first the very first thing i ever wrote um was a program that would beat you at tic-tac-toe if
it was possible on an atari 800 so and i i was not i mean say again what made you want to write that
um i didn't really want to write it i needed so i was my primary interests
in the early days when i was what 1920 this is 40 years ago were i had read ray kurzweil
so i thought i'm gonna make a mind i'm gonna build a mind in a machine right
and so i think that that game was an outcome of that it wasn't elegant um my code i was the first
thing i ever wrote right so there was no elegance there i had to codify i had to specifically codify
i had to build an array of every possible game which i did annually i manually built an array of
every possible game because i didn't know you know how to do it algorithmically oh wow okay
it's hilarious when you say it that way it sounds like i could beat this beat this game
now if it was possible for the machine to win it would always win but it's not always possible right
the possibility space is obviously games are like this right the possibility space transforms based on
who start who goes first you know actually i guess that's the primary determinant of the possibility
space in tick-hack-toe um oh god what's the most amazing app you've ever touched
there's so many apps oh my gosh um but what's amazing
so i am very blurry thinking about this maybe it's a crappy question
maybe um i actually can't help but think of my own app not not that it's the most amazing app but
i love that i made something that was purpose-built for my needs as a musician and
it works the way i did what it said and i was able to increase my capacity to learn music um
other people have said the same thing so it's not just my my experience and so i like that that's great
you know and that's uh my i think my perspective about apps did come from this perhaps steve jobs
mentality of like technology should augment us like the tools should augment us i've never been interested
in an app that will tell me the notes of what's there or like do things for me um in this
uh yeah like i i made something that i can use as a tool that that extends my capacity or at least
that's how i'm framing it and it's arguable whether this is actually a distinction but look
i i do have this angle and most of the things that i do with technology which is it should
augment you in some way yeah i feel very similarly this is this is the motivation behind the toy that
i was talking about right i think like when we touch a machine particularly if we're going to be doing
that together we should it should really give us something profound and certainly it's possible
for that to happen so why isn't there more of that going on is one of my questions but um
i have some other a couple of other questions at least if i mean i have endless questions i'm curious as
as anything um just to know a little bit more about your life history and your encounters with media
that changed you um could you tell me a few books that radically altered a few books that really had
an impact on you uh when i read entertain amusing ourselves to death entertaining ourselves to death
by uh neil postman it was one of the few times where i felt compelled to read everything by an author
um that was not normal for me so his the way he talks and then there's been a couple of his other
books as well like technopoly and uh uh i forget the titles now but like yeah um his his perspectives
about technology and education and like formula to uh i used to be this
i used to be kind of obsessed with the pianists uh jazz classical pianist and perhaps uh philosopher
spiritual guru keith jarrett oh yeah yeah let's go talk he could speak for like an hour and it would
be super interesting and there would be all kinds of cool stuff and he was super like confident in how
he says everything so you think like oh no he must have something that i'm missing and as a young as a
a younger person i would i would think this and um i may be less obsessed with them now but um anyway
i've been also quite um moved by some of those ideas that he has about music and perhaps just like
being real real or like just i don't know how to characterize it in short words but um anyway just
uh i enjoy some of that so um yeah i don't know um yeah what about you oh my goodness um
i mean when you were telling that story i was reminded of the day in my 19th year
when i brought a roland gino 60 home from the music store never having touched
a keyboard in my life as a guitar player and just having my mind completely blown away i mean people
talk about like the top of the line juno is like top of the line keyboard yeah i mean back then to
have a synthesizer as a common person was an impossible dream right so the juno the juno 60s still
you know every everybody's trying to emulate it right even to this day so but yeah um no there
were people who i read when i was a child jules verne and edgar allen poe i mean look i've read
thousands of science fiction novels and that stuff's impacted me very dramatically but there's a few
books that are particularly important once i emerged from the womb of science fiction into reading other
stuff um one of them was julian james's book the origins of consciousness in the breakdown of the
bicameral mind one of them is owen barfield's saving the appearances um there were musicians who had
dramatic effects on me as a guitar player uh i remember seeing i remember going to the performance
of one of the teachers at the university of the pacific in stockton and watching for the first
time in my life a man play classical music on a lute and i lost my shit i was i i buried my faith i just
i was just crying i was crying right i couldn't handle the beauty of it i was it was it just seemed like
what did i did i come in this room and just die here to the beauty music from the 1500s yeah yeah
yeah and later um a brilliant uh woman who i'm not sure if she still teaches at sonoma state or not
marilyn thompson was conducting a choir in a catholic church in petaluma sometime in the 80s
and my roommate was singing in it so i got to sing with her and some of the music she selected and
exposed me to it ripped me a new one um there's a victoria kyrie that i was i had the privilege of
singing i mean you know it's um and as far as people who influenced me and i want to know like
yeah you mentioned keith jarrett but who are some other people who were a really huge influence on
you and they don't have to be famous tell me someone from your life like that you met
uh there's so many people i was actually at some point i i printed out on like
um yeah i printed out photos of all these people that i was influenced by and i would just like
on like eight and a half by eleven standard paper you know in black and white because everything had
to be black and white for me and i would just plaster my whole like tiny i didn't even have a room
actually i was living with my parents and they had their bedroom and i had this kind of solarium
which is like half a room um so it's very pumped and like i would just and let's say i you know the
environment was just very different from what i was interested in or where i was trying to go and like
it was nice to just be reminded of some of the things that i enjoyed you know and um so yeah just like
faces you know like i mentioned jared i was really in steve jobs for a while
um you know maybe like glenn gould maybe uh actually a lot of musicians um i don't know if
there's so many non-musicians there you might just end up reciting a bunch of jazz musicians but um
it's so long ago honestly i don't think about it um i want to know someone who who was in your life
maybe a teacher or i want to i want to hear about someone you knew i was quite inspired by this
uh pianist from who was an alumni of the university i was studying at and occasionally he did shows
there and i think at some point even when he was teaching there but i never i i wasn't in the jazz
program so i couldn't encounter him as a student but maybe there's an audience member or this kind of
thing so uh david braid you i'm still in contact with him today i hope to meet him again after a
long time but um uh yeah i've uh i was really inspired by his so the the first time i had heard
of him was when i went to this concert that was in the basement but sorry i went to this concert
this concert um with him and uh phil nimitz who was kind of the main name uh phil nimitz for
anyone who's not in canada is uh passed away this year actually but um was known for many years as
like the dean of canadian jazz um i personally wouldn't say a sentence like this but hopefully
that gives some context say he's a clarinetist playing music for like 80 years um supreme
musician um plays all kinds of music great composer um i played one of his pieces in piano recital at
one of his piano pieces when i was piano singers anyway i had heard of phil nimitz at the time so
i was like oh cool phil nimitz i know that guy i'm gonna go to this thing i think it was so um i don't
want to call it shallow but it's just like i just had no context actually for like what this was i
just recognized like one name vaguely and um there were these other two guys one was david brade and
one was matt brubeck the son of dave brubeck i guess oh brubeck okay yeah i'll go to this show um
i love how there's like a sometimes a very trivial reason to go to something it ends up changing the
life so all right so i go to this place sorry you're right yeah yeah um i i go to this concert and
it's a comp it's basically like free improvised music and i was really into that i had actually
been doing that on my own and for two years in uh in university uh one of my colleagues and i did this
piano improvisation podcast which was like every week we would get together and record piano
improvisation sometimes with two pianos sometimes with one and it used to be like 45 minutes long
and then or sometimes and then at some point we transitioned to doing these kinds of pieces like
shorter and then we came up with a concept for an album and we did like an album every month with
the improvisations and got the guests got in guests and sometimes got the guest helping with cover art
etc so that was kind of a fun project um for two years but yeah so i was really interested in free
improvisation uh went to this concert with filming ones david brade matt brubeck and they're all just like
i don't know if maybe there was some composed music for the first half and the second half was
improvised i think that's what happened so the second half was like this purely the last thing and
it was like i was my mind was blown because i was like i this is what i do they're doing that thing
and i was not really exposed to so-called free jazz before this time and um maybe even if i heard it
i wouldn't have understood it that like that's what i'm doing but i just really related to what they were
doing like perhaps um yeah so i just really related to that and like yeah i bought one of these i bought
their album and i got all of them to sign it that day and um i just really like that that that just
shook me up for like a while i was like okay cool it's possible to do this possible to even have like a
show and people come to watch this thing i'm like wow this is cool um yeah and and david who i got to
i learned his name through that concert and then i watched him play he's a great musician fantastic musician
um he's very generous with his time he met me a couple times and just showed me different
possibilities maybe or even some live guidance and um or just heard me out and like i just really
appreciate that he was kind of there in a way uh while i was in my formative years and so yeah anyway
he so he's one david is one of these people that i kind of discovered by accident but his his composure
is his musicianship he also wrote things like he had a couple of pieces that he wrote on his web
sorry a couple of texts that he wrote on his website like i would call them blog entries he might call
them essays whatever like but okay a musician that writes things you know like keith jared also writes
things like so i like this idea that um you have to express in different ways and yeah so he was
pretty inspiring inspiring to me for ronnell um that's somebody i knew i guess beautiful
um some so i i just have some other kind of personal questions films that impacted you
so actually maybe i i'll bring up this other thing because when you ask me about books
there's maybe a relevant thread to everything that we're talking about with uh because books i
actually feel like i haven't read that many books i'm trying now to like read more voraciously but
in the past let's say in like my high school years i actually had this very deliberate idea of
like i don't want to read books because it's too hard i should just be able to watch a video or have
it like at some point it'll just be streamed into my brain so why should i waste my time this was my
perspective when i was younger right and and um i've i don't know at what point like maybe
five ten years ago or something i probably had this other point of view it's like oh wow okay books
are probably the best technology we've ever invented i want to read i like the way that my
imagination is engaged with it etc but i think it's an interesting um i mean anyway i think it's
relevant to our conversation to have this kind of perspective that like uh i should just be able to
watch something because it's in 3d or maybe at some point i just get the information like the
matrix you know like i'm just waiting for that and to want right i'll be able to catch up later when
they can just beam it into my skull right waste all this time turning pages of a physical object
because obviously they're gonna have something way better next year yeah go ahead i can't wait it is
also it is also that maybe i do have a hard some kind of hard time and i still kind of have a hard time
like paying attention to like pages or i notice now maybe i'm like i'm speaking while i'm reading
like i'm reading uh auditory like i'm then maybe um that feels slow to me so maybe i get frustrated
or i lose my place i have some challenge with like concentrating on pages so maybe that's also
partially why i was leaning towards that other future but uh anyway i love books now and i'm happy
to read more of them i even keep track of which books i read and i try to like use that as a motivation
for myself um uh but yeah just a funny thought with respect to your question because i was like
oh no i don't have any books to quote to this guy actually um how about figures who aren't musicians
that you were influenced by or that you really looked up to and that that you wanted to emulate
or were just really impressed with well mostly steve jobs i would say that was a huge one for me like
i was actually jeans and i mean let me be totally clear i've been i've been aficionado of apple
equipment since it was invented and that's the platform that i that i use right and um as i said
i think my my mind was deeply influenced by the way the finder works because i've spent more time with
the finder than any human being on earth that i know right wait what i meant was i spent more time
with the finder than any human right in my life um but there's a lot of people who i was deeply
influenced by uh i'm asking you though so you mentioned jobs jared give me a couple other names
if there are a musician i guess but maybe it's not necessarily for his music like glenn gould he's
a canadian pianist and also he's done some very interesting writing which i like he also did some
kind of music project with radio and stuff but um uh yeah he's his eccentric kind of um sorry it's
kind of interesting to me it's funny i haven't thought also i think i am quite influenced by like
not that i don't tend to think about myself as like having influences and these are my influences
and these people like i think i'm i for a while i've been if not in search of good ideas or just
try to keep my ears open for things wherever they happen to be and um finding stuff on the internet or
in my circles or in books or whatever and i've been interested in like journaling and like writing
things down when i find an interesting passage from a book i used to like hand write out the entire
passage and nice until like 2018 you know i was still gonna bring that into a digital um but like
great ideas are in so many places and there have been you know for example uh an interview with
um somebody who i recorded with recently but um casey so called who's a music professor at a different
university that i studied at you know his video uh interviews from like 10 or 15 years ago like i i
i remember seeing that and like i had to save the video because i'm like i need to watch this again
in like a year like this there's so much something about his character or the way he talks talks and
like and also the ideas of course but there's something cool happening there that i wanted to
like reconnect with again but it's just like okay there's some things from there you know it doesn't
mean that like this person is such a strong force in my life but i carry some of those ideas with me
or those ways of being and and i can say that about like dozens of people and it's it feels strange for
me to just name all of these people but um yeah anyway i prefer to say i'm inspired by the multitudes
or something like this um i follow if that's that's yeah i mean we all have a very eclectic uh sort of
solar system of the minds and the beings who have informed our own creativity and our curiosity our
learning our vision um so yeah films i know i'm going hard on media here but any film it's hard to
watch yeah i'm not barely like yeah it takes too long films take too long sorry no sweat i do enjoy
them but i can't i don't do it as a hobby because it just it seems like too long have you ever had
uh have you had any experiences of unusual events while you were sleeping or dreaming
unusual events that come to mind
i would basically say no but at the same time to share that my perspective about dreaming is like
um
i think i try to keep it in a box and i i think maybe you have a completely different way to look at dreams but
um yeah my inclination is just to kind of not read too much into them like uh just see it as my
brain or my mind figuring things out or whatever and and so i have this because i have that perspective
i tend to not or perhaps i even deliberately try to um
um not not get too affected by them because of course while i'm in them it's like oh my god it's
there's it's really scary or it's really i'm really emotional about it or something or
um it can kind of overwhelm me and i don't want i don't want to feel like i can't trust the reality
that i'm in or whatever so there's something about it that's kind of i don't know it's a bit eerie to me
and like i uh no no it's not it's not eerie it's just like
yeah i think it maybe it's confusing i don't know that i i think i'm in one place but i'm actually
i'm in another place and and that can be disappointing and i just don't want that so
um but what what what about you oh yeah i mean i'm fascinated by dreaming i mean we have like two lives
right and one of them doesn't get enough airplay i think um but i i can go on about that forever so
yeah i've had unusual experiences while dreaming for sure um there's things like sleep paralysis
right you wake up you can't move you're conscious it's weird there's strange things going on in the
mind um but i'm sorry can't move that's beyond the the like circulation is cut off and it comes back
after you mean like no it has no there's yeah so there's a thing that can happen when when you fall
asleep your nervous system undergoes some transformations and there's a thing that can
happen when you're in between being asleep and being awake right you're sort of in that between phase
or you can wake up in your body and whether or not you can move we don't really know but you feel
that you can't move um and it can be very frightening often it is accompanied by unusual
mental phenomena hallucinations we uh i think they would usually call them so yeah i've had experiences
of that um i think i've had experiences that people call like the obe thing right out of body experiences
and stuff and i always like to ask people a little bit about their dreams you know what their what what
their relationship with their dreaming experience is and stuff but we don't have to you know we don't
have to belabor it um where's i gonna go dreaming oh yeah ever see anything in the sky that you didn't
know what it was it's like the book question it's like i don't look up enough but i mean of course i
look at this guy um but to notice this kind of thing i would say
you know sometimes there's like there's like something flashing and i just hope it's not a
plane because that would be so sad um or if not flashing just like oh like yeah you know maybe it's
like a a star or something but anyway that's just me wishing something um yeah not knowing i guess
something comes to mind at the moment um do you have pets i have never had pets except for some
reason i remember when i was like six or seven there was a turtle in our house and we used to keep
poking its head back into the shell because i didn't know any better um but no i really like other people's
pets and uh i i don't think uh yeah i think i moved around a lot and i'm traveling i'm not really in a
stable place and it doesn't have the affordances to like have a you know take care of the pets and um
i tend to avoid that kind of responsibility it's funny i've heard extremely few humans ever use that word
affordances um so it's interesting that you selected that say again it's a design design word right i
was oh is it yeah wow
you know i have so many other questions but perhaps this might be a good time for us to wind down
what are your thoughts and if you have any questions i'm happy to i'm happy to respond um
i also have stuff but i think uh yeah it's almost two hours and it's kind of late and i have an early
flight and i'm sure we can chat again i would love to meet you in person and um figure up on your
offering you can have in san francisco so yeah that'd be amazing yeah i think let's let's do that i
think there's enough to chew on here right on so much appreciate it yeah thank you so much yeah
thank you uh for your uh questions and your attention and your interest in what i'm doing
like i'm kind of just uh yeah it's just it's very heartwarming to have someone take an interest in what
i do on the internet in this way and then to react in a way that feels like kind of
concorded with what i was trying to do in the first place um which seems like not happen so
often but um yeah i just and i appreciate your your honesty and your your time and yeah it's great
yeah i'm so grateful man really enjoyed it and uh i hope you have a great rest of your night and
a beautiful flight and let's talk again sometime soon yeah we'd love that man all right peace for now
do
