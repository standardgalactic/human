The big red shoes are like roses on my toes.
Watch me on the screen and kiss the tune as we're warm and wet.
You know, I need it. So come on down. Come on down and ride my big red shoes.
My love for you is on TV. It's waiting for you when you get home.
Just turn it on and tune me in.
We'll feel it together when you're alone.
It's warm inside my deep red glow.
You love, admit it. So come on down.
Come on down. Come on down.
We'll feel it together when you're alone.
My love for you is on TV. Just turn it on and tune me in.
You love, admit it. So come on down.
It's warm inside my deep red glow. It's waiting for you when you get home.
You love, admit it. So come on down. Come on down.
You love, admit it. So come on down.
You love, admit it. So come on down. Come on down.
You love, admit it. So come on down. Come on down.
I'll kiss your mushy, beaten head. Who's done these awful things to you?
Who's done these awful things to you? Just waiting for you when you get home.
Waiting for you, waiting for you when you get home. Just turn it on and tune me in.
But the desk lamp's fine. We'll consume me. But we know.
You love, admit it. So come on down.
You love, admit it. So come on down.
Come on down. And ride my big red shoes.
I'll kiss your mushy, beaten head. Who's done these awful things to you?
You love, admit it. So come on down. Come on down.
You love, admit it. We'll concentrate the lovely little.
I love for you when you turn to me.
It's waiting for you when you get home. Just turn it on and tune to me.
What do you feel together when you're young?
What do you want to land this last night?
We'll feel it, baby.
We'll feel it together when you're alone.
Just your washing feet.
I'm not gonna do that.
You don't want to see me.
Oh, I'll send these awful things to you.
Just turn it on.
I'm getting the end.
It's waiting for you.
When you get home, we will consummate the love we know.
You love. Admit it.
So come on down.
Come on down.
Come on down.
Come on.
Come on down.
Come on.
We are here to be here when you're alone.
