okay so we are now recording just so everybody knows normally there's a announcement in the
channel um i'll just deal with any background noise on my end but yeah so
i'm expecting oh there's beast hey beast
bye
yeah he's got his mic muted for the moment but um yeah beast i uh i sent you a
sort of a meme about wolves and them having invented the game of fetch uh they were playing
it when we discovered them apparently rather than having to wait for humans with hands to throw
sticks for them uh they were doing that on their own and then recently uh
beast oh yeah yeah yeah that's awesome um he said they play it with each other in ravens
uh i've been in touch with a feral human in the outback of um quebec who i'm hoping to interview
maybe sometime in the coming week zvanko obavec and zvanko is a feral
human he lives out in the nothing in a cabin he built surrounded by animals that hunt humans and
stuff and i thought you might find it interesting that when we were talking a couple nights ago i've
known him for about 10 years we've had a few long conversations he's uh he's very unusual he's croatian
older croatian guy and we were talking the other night and he said um i don't have much time i have
appointment like oh yeah you know yes i have appointment okay so you're out in the middle of
nothing in the snow in quebec and you have appointments like yes i have wolves there are four
wolves in front about half mile away there are seven to the left there are two to the right there are four
behind me about four miles i have to go meet them we talk like okay so you're talking to the wolves
like yes we talk i'm like well so you know i asked him um well i'd be really you know i have a request
he said what is it i said you know i want you to ask the wolves if they will come to me in my dreaming
and teach me wolf things and he said oh for that i must find white wolf shaman wolf i only see him
you know once twice a year but i will remember and ask him okay so i'm like what do you talk about
and he's like well we don't talk and i and i said but you know you said that that you're going to go
talk with them said i did not mean talk i meant we dance around and howl and go crazy together in the snow
so yeah apparently svanko's out there with some you know undomesticated wild canines
and i'm really hoping to get an interview with him because he's a wildly unusual human the being
i i said um so you know you have friends out there he said i don't have friends i prefer enmity and
isolation no no no that's not what he said he said he said i prefer animosity and isolation it was very
important difference did you ask him why oh i know why i mean it's for the same reason we're having this
meeting right now um yeah he he's well aware that what the humans do in cities is has very little
to do with being alive or being human or being intelligent or anything so he just he doesn't
want any part of that at all only part of that yes your life city life is thoroughly alienating and
isolating my friend yeah yeah so he wants no part of that he's married i asked him you know zonko when
was the last time you kissed a woman except not in that accident he said oh yeah last week i'm like oh
yeah he's like yeah like who he's like my wife see her on facebook my page she come she come out here
like oh great that's awesome glad it's like why you ask about this and i said well you know i have
to answer him very carefully or he'll they'll mess with me
they said well a woman's love is like oxygen or the stars in the night sky or the cry of a wild animal
you cannot identify and he said oh i understand you're a poet
what do you think his reason for messing with movies uh well your words i think uh
uh weirdly and somehow accidentally certainly not intentionally um i managed to acquire his respect
and admiration uh based on my posts on facebook which of course as any of you see those posts know
have almost nothing to do with anything personal about me and have a lot to do with
insight or cognition language and he used to teach math at the university maybe in calgary but i'm not
sure and uh so he was a math teacher and he feels uh essentially assaulted by me he's like i i did not
choose i did not choose mathematics mathematics was forced upon me by theories come to me in the night and
never asked me they beat me up in my mind um but yeah i think i acquired his respect so
when we talk it's a bit it resembles something more like a zen mondo between us you know a couple of zen
teachers or something right where we're kind of you know he he said you know he asked me questions like
tell me something you don't know and i said i don't think there is anything that i actually know
and he says that is something you know tell me something you don't know
what did you say to him i said um well now what i'm trying to say is that i don't really trust knowledge
much at all i understand how it works but i i don't i don't think it's uh authoritative
um and so the last time we talked a couple days ago he said um what is the truth
and i said i don't remember exactly what i said but it was something like
the truth is like a ray of light from the divine that is both urgently pursued and simultaneously unknowable
and then he said and then i said um spanko i was like yes like what is a lie
and he got a funny look on his face and he said no one ever asked me this question before him
no one no one asked me this i'm going to have to meditate on that
i mean he could have just said human civilization it's a big lie
we're never civilized we're not civilized now and never civilized before
i mean that would be an interesting thing for us to talk about too what is it what is it like
i mean you can say what i would think about it but what do you think about it
um you know i i don't want to be uh it's the right word
i don't want to be a curmudgeon but i think that if we're about if we intend to have a deep topic
excuse me a deep conversation about something we should probably we should we should resist the
urge to believe that we know what words mean because they certainly don't mean their senses in the
dictionary um so what we have to do if we're going to be intelligent together is to playfully and
perhaps cunningly um explore why we're asking something and what we would what in in this
conversation we intend to mean by certain terms does that make sense
it's like i was talking with lee last night and we were talking we actually talked about 19 other
things we i'm not sure we actually got to this topic but um i i introduced
the idea of the relationship of intellect to dreaming
and i i sort of knew i sort of knew what i meant by intellect but i quickly realized that in order for
this conversation to become interesting or meaningful um we'd have to define our terms much more
carefully especially that like what is meant by by intellect did you settle on something as a definition
um
no because we ended up pursuing uh
wild other topics such as
snake cheese medusai even the snake in genesis women milking snakes jesus is actually cheese bait we
just mispronounced his name because it was actually originally cheeses um the human addiction to cheese
uh how people really get depressed if they if if it is if it becomes clear that cheese will not be
available um you know you go to a party there's no cheese you're out of there i mean
uh yeah we had some crazy i took some notes on the try and write a comedy routine about the snake milk
thing because it has a lot to do with what almond hillman's talking about um with the medusai and medea
and the origins of medicine and stuff and i think these ladies they were milking snakes i'm i don't mean
to be pornographic about it but they were straight up milking snakes uh and snakes have milk
well even if we suppose that snakes don't have milk so first of all
most a lot of people don't know this but rattlesnakes give give birth to live young
um yeah but uh
even if we decide that you can't actually get milk from snake tits
um there are two other important possibilities and the first one
one is the milk of their anciently evolved intelligence and memory
and the second one which is straight up physically real
is that humans milk them for the venom to produce antidotes
right and that venom is often milky yeah they call it milk exactly so
you know metaphorically or actually right right yeah okay but yeah there's a guy on
i think it was stanley's superhumans really neat show from some years back who
injected himself with snake venom uh one kind was actually black mamba venom which is supposed to render
you like neurologically paralyzed and dead within half an hour or something and he was able to basically
not have his brain be negatively affected by it so he would like sit in front of the camera
with a nurse beside them and uh inject himself with black mamba venom quite a lot and uh
other than a lesion at the site of injection he seemed perfectly fine which i found interesting
um it's well known that ancient people and there are a few people walking around today i think there's
one guy who's fairly famous it could be the guy you're talking about might be a different guy as well
but what omen hillman regularly talks about is women who were both immune to the venoms of various lethal
snakes via the titrated introduction of venoms into their bloodstream over time and could also convey
immunity to these venoms uh which is at least in one place perhaps with paul in the bible discussed as
one of the gifts of the spirit of christ or or the divine beings one to be immune to snake venom
um do you think i'm just because i don't know how this just information i have this was
explained i mean i mean i know homeopathically this is just me guessing you know homeopathically you can
have not one element of the the cure which is actually would if you did have any elements of it
be the cause of similar
experiences or problems that the body has but with homeopathy
you can very often get rid of the very problem that the actual elements in the cure which is say
titrated or something to the point that there's not one molecule left and i'm kind of wondering if um
i know energetic healing exists and i wonder if somebody who had exposed themselves to
the snake venom so i guess at the time that was something people were being bitten regularly by snakes
i guess but wouldn't been such a big deal um you know can be in a similar way that somebody who develops
an immunity no longer has any of it in them but has the experience of having it in them and whether if
you're a healer you can energetically convey that essence so to speak of the experience to another
person i mean did they talk about how you know was there anything how that was um yes so uh
you know vaccines began in a similar fashion um they were aware of the excuse me some humans in ancient
greece were aware of this uh technology there's also stories of um cow herd women in india perhaps
3 000 years ago um taking the pus from smallpox lesions on cows um diluting it placing it on bandages
scratching people's skin surfaces and wrapping them in the bandages to convey immunity to smallpox or at
least a reduced response um as far as homeopathy goes you know we have a huge problem there because
actual studies of it have not revealed any effect
um so if you know if we're paying attention to the science realizing that science isn't always the
right lens to look with there's a problem there um also there's another problem which is that if
homeopathy were real what would have to cause the medicine to become medicinal is not merely the exposure
to the substance because if if if the homeopathic um theorem was true you know everything we eat
would have homeopathic levels of billions of substances in it right which would cause which
would leave us with two problems the first one being in that kind of a situation how is it that
the little pills actually have any effect at all when we're living in a home in a manifold of swarming
homeopathy homeopathic energetic uh signatures right see the problem well well i actually don't actually
see that necessarily as a problem because the way i look at it is that um we are prepared in other words
we've grown up with and we have existed with eating things that are of value to us and that we use the
necessary parts of we're not you know assuming processed foods or anything but you know but
the whole foods we we do that the substances in that are used in homeopathy are are are not those
things they are actually poisons that we avoid and that our experience i mean if we did run into some of
those things and eat them we could die potentially or i mean that the it's a symbol it's supposed to be
similar whatever would cause something similar to the disease or the problem that you're treating with
homeopathy is in itself if it were ingested potentially poisonous and the reason and that
and that according to homeopathy and i'm not well studied on it i have had positive results but um but
according to homeopathy those are the substances that are basically potentized and actually supposed
to be the most potent according to homeopathy by the degree to which they are kind of shaken into the
sugar mixture or whatever to the point that there is literally not one molecule left of the actual
substance so it seems to be that it's the memory in essence the the signature of the substance that
remains in homeopathy and homeopathy from my understanding of how it works is the remedies or the
cures or what you know what it offers is the thing that if you did ingest it as a poison or toxin would
cause the various symptoms that you're trying to alleviate so it's really it's it's a different
kind of a thing it's the it's the signature so to speak of of it and if you i don't know you know if
you pay much attention to you know to the whole emoto stuff or what you think about that with the
water retaining you know the quality of even a thought um or a word or a whatever and its structure
you know it it basically supposes that there is a sensitivity to things that can encode that kind
of thing so that's my understanding of what homeopathy is and this is just me it's my little commercial
for oscillococcinum i have not had a flu in over 30 years
and i had home a pardon me an acupuncturist tell me about oscillococcin many years ago
and um if i take that at the first sign of anything i don't get it so i've never had a flu shot i never
had a flu not in 30 years and before that i would have them maybe once twice you know once a year once
every couple years so to me it seems to work because every time i do take it it it literally gets rid of
it so that's right okay well that was a that was an interesting presentation um so first of all
the print one of the or the originary principles of medicine is precisely the principle you describe
here where an extremely small titration of a substance that would be harmful produces the
opposite result and therefore can act as an antidote to that substance um however it should be clear
that the one thing the oxaloitocin or whatever that stuff's called does not contain is flu viruses
so i'm not sure i'm not it's the symptoms it's the homeopathy got it got it different yeah yeah let
me let me continue so um the concept in homeopathy is that you place one or more substances
i mean there's a vast lexicon of symptoms and diseases and then there are along with those symptoms
and diseases are the substances that are used homeopathically to treat them and then the
substances are placed in a solution extremely might minute titrations or dilutions of those substances
extremely minute are placed in like a five gallon you know container of water and then i don't know some
one droplet of that is placed in a second five gallon container then one and mixed and then one
droplet of that and so forth and so on now they make the pills out of the resulting stuff now i think
you either ignored or you just didn't care about what i said which was that if homeopathy if homeopathy
were real then the unimaginable cloud of extremely minute amounts of every substance on earth that we are
swimming in would constantly be affecting us and even if it weren't how could it possibly be true
that the minor minute amounts of basic zero amount actually what what you have is energetic
memory of some substance in a pill right so there's nothing in that pill um energetic
memory of some substance well we are swimming in i didn't get it yeah we are swimming in
get trillions of situations where the energetic memory of substances is everywhere in every glass
of water we drink in every piece of food we eat in the air we breathe in everything that we're exposed to
all day long so that um if homeopathy were true all of those things should affect us
right and and problematically more problematically how possibly could the non-existent amount of
energetic memory of a substance in the homeopathic pill overcome the noise floor of all that other stuff
right there's this huge vast noise floor that would be monumental it's like thunder versus not even a
whisper no i understand what you're saying okay i don't know the answer to that of course but i would
imagine that one way possibly and i don't know that this is is the answer to that but one way would be
that um any of those other things like if you take a homeopathic remedy for some you know let's say you
took other ones that other than the specific one that you needed for your that would cause your specific
symptoms if you took any of the other ones they wouldn't harm you but they also wouldn't do
anything for you on the other hand i don't know that in that morass of everything that's swimming
around you is necessarily the one element or the several elements as combined that would be necessary
that's the only thing i could think that would explain that actually i can easily think of another thing
the worst um so the humans uh when they think about things they do so in a very stupid array of ways
and uh by the way hi risa nice to see you um yeah they do so in a very stupid way array of ways
and one of the stupid things they do and i'm not trying to be mean by the use of this word but
the stupidity itself is actually quite cruel to us um is they they think as if
uh the power is in the substance
the substance has a mechanical power to cause effects in the humans right that's how they think
that's how uh allopathic medicine works right um we we depend on a mechanical effect in the body
of a substance but it the weird problem with that is the idea that humans are separate from nature
um is someone filing their nails it sounds like it it does
um yeah so but all of our all of our modern knowledge ways possibly including homeopathy
suppose that humans are separate from nature and they're using little machines from nature
to come into the human thing and and change things around
so that can't be true let's just be absolutely clear there's no separation between humans and nature
there's more separation between um a droplet of the ocean flying up in the air and the and the ocean
itself there's more separation there than there is between humans and nature humans are nature whatever
nature may be right but the humans don't think that way and they like to think mechanically like
we're separate playing over here and then there's all that other stuff called nature
including homeopathy right any other thing so so the easy solution i can see
is that the the conspiracy between the patient the homeopath the homeopathic practitioner
the water the substance the history of the homeopathic idea all those things combine to produce an actual
effect that i could understand right which you don't have that conspiracy you're saying it's basically
a placebo effect that's what you're saying yeah i'm not actually quite saying that i'm saying something
weirder um you we if we if we allow that a placebo is equivalent to the things i said previously the
that the effect is caused by the the kind of thing the conspiracy and all that i said previously
then yeah i'm saying the placebo effect but i mean um you know there's this peculiar document
on medium it's called notes from beyond and it describes the history of a set of messages i've
been receiving now for some months after having received a decryption key um and in those messages
and there's a vast number of them um there's a video on the placebo effect that's quite staggering
uh it's probably not exactly the same as like it's not so shocking as like someone had their leg cut
off and then they they met a healer and the healer said three words to them and they grew a new leg
right but it's pretty close um there are instances of sudden inexplicable healing in humans that are
really profound and excusing them as the quote placebo effect is a dumb idea because what do we
know about harm and healing right well we know maybe you know 0.07 percent of what there is to know
yet many humans and human cultures and stuff go around acting as if they're authoritative
they they we know what's going on we we do this all the time um well well let me ask you something
i mean first of all just to clarify by placebo effect i certainly think that you were saying
just to see if this is what you mean you know in terms of what the way you were looking at it
um i mean i think of it in terms of the fact that the mind is ours you know it's part of everything and
it has extreme powers um you know and also the kind of thing where if you're you know we can the way
the mind works you can also create disease within yourself if you feel certain ways um you know about
things you can and there's all kinds of correlation between emotion and feeling and you know and and
the kinds of things that your body that you do within your own body so i mean i think there's a lot
of those elements to it um you know just to just to say that and so that's what i think about in terms
of placebo it encompasses all of that but i i do i have a question i mean you say we're not apart from
nature which i agree with the whole completely 100 percent if we are nature um but we eat you know
things which are technically quote unquote outside of ourselves to eat and what we eat very well determines
our state of health so i don't think i mean and there's certainly been herbology this is i'm going
to say this really quick because i don't want to monopolize anything but you know herbology has been
around for a really long time and by observation that it has discovered certain substances and medicine
has kind of taken off of that and its various roots and my my particular physician who i agree with is
that you know that that's in the background modern medicine is basically poisons that have some
positive benefits and i kind of agree that a lot of that is the case i mean when they create a modern
medicine from an herbal remedy they or a plant they only take certain elements not the full plant
and very often it's actually the whole plant that has the medicinal quote-unquote value that causes
ceilings so i just wanted to say that in general so a few things come to mind first is that herbalism
was not discovered by observation in most cases uh the herbalistic knowledge that comes down to us
moderns was discovered in trance in visions in conversations between the spirits of plants and
animals and humans um i've heard this noise before and i'm not trying to be i'm not trying to be critical
of you nancy but i i heard a similar noise from a guy who went down to south america and founded a
company called shaman pharmaceuticals because he had they had discovered that the shamans down there in
one of the indigenous cultures um that uses a psychedelic snort a psychedelic um snuff one of the one of
those cultures uh had discovered remedies for thousands of diseases and so this guy went down
there and their goal was to kind of rescue that culture by um opportunistically capitalizing on the
knowledge of these shamans and uh they you know he talked about similarity and how for example something
that looks like a heart could be good for your heart and things like this but i asked him um very pointedly
in in the lecture this is about 23 24 years ago now happened at uh golden gate parks the lecture hall
but anyway um i can probably find the guy's name uh it wasn't the yanamami he was looking at
let me see here but i asked him um so and i i knew i knew how they um
i knew the answer to my question before i asked it so i asked him how did they discover
which plants or concoctions were good for which diseases and he got a funny look on his face he looked
around there and he said trial and error and i was like are you kidding me right now
there's like well four billion plants down there they live in the amazon rainforest no that makes
sense that makes sense a matter of fact they had this thing i don't know if you saw it that i think
it was um a monkey an ape or whatever it was uh self-medicating with some kind of a plant did you see
that recently i heard about it yeah um and it was so you could look it up if you want but it's you know
it was really clear that they knew and knowing no right quote unquote the problem yeah is is really the
way we know anything matter of fact direct um i don't want to i just thought of this the other day
that i don't want to let what i what i think i know i know interfere with my knowing because it's
the knowing that is the direct and i agree with that i mean i think that that is how things
you know are known but once we divide it into you you know take so sick but those plants you know
however we know this and and we do know it and i agree with you i mean that makes far more sense than
the idea of trial and error you know you know however we know it that knowledge you know you
know is effective knowledge and it is something quote unquote from outside of us that goes inside
of us but so does food you know um there's a bunch of presumptions there that i don't trust i hear what
you're saying and you're using ordinary language and i acknowledge that and i'm not trying to you know
again i'm not trying to be a curmudgeon but i want to distinguish between uh knowledge sub asterisk and
knowledge sub a and knowledge sub b so knowledge sub b is is what common humans think and say and
that kind of knowledge sub a is what skillful humans are capable of thinking and imagining and
doing and knowledge sub asterisk that's the you're talking about that the that the monkey's using
right that's not regular knowledge so this is what i mean by defining our terms carefully right and and
ordinarily you know we need at least a three-layer description to have any chance of being intelligent
together notice how rarely humans um you know how rarely they they play this way right they almost never
do what i just did with the word knowledge i mean have you even heard one other person do it anytime
in the past 10 years one time they just think that a single word means the thing this means one thing
dang it you know hand me a beer johnny let's go fix some truck parts i think i think plato and the cave
drive that you know yeah okay great so someone did it you know um 1800 years ago one time amazing thank
god but yeah so you see what i'm saying like if we're going to talk intelligently we need to use
language much more carefully than what we're used to hearing reading seeing or relating with and it's
easy to do we just have to have the agreement that we're going to do that together and then we have to
be careful about understanding the different meanings of terms um so i want to go back to
i want to circle back to a couple of topics here um i think it's important to highlight the conspiracy
that occurs uh potentially at least between the patient the homeopath the water the substance and
the tradition let's call that conspiracy let's call that conspiracy homeopathy not the medicine let's not
call the medicine homeopathy right the medicine is one of the um elements in that conspiracy
and i think that conspiracy is very important and you know there's a positive um there's a positive
gloss on the the word conspiracy right and i think we're seeing it here now um it's also entirely clear to me
that many humans have straight up died from believing that that homeopathic medicine could save them
straight up died right those people died they're like this homeopathic medicine
it's gonna you know it's gonna be amazing it'll it'll cure me i can avoid them bad allopaths and
surgery and all those bad that about all medicine no no it's true but i'm just trying to say that um yeah
if homeopathy has ever cured a very serious metabolic or physical disease
i've never heard of that i'd be very surprised to hear that however um when a disease
is is remediated i would love to see the proof that it was remediated by a medicine
or a treatment because when something which is basically harm caused by doctors hospitals and
the medical system itself in many estimates is the third or even second leading cause of death in north
america i think i think you're right you're absolutely right yeah the problem is um it's really difficult to
to determine uh i'm just looking this up
so i've certainly experienced some myatrogenic harm i think most of us who've been exposed to
doctors have whether it was serious or not is is more you know more complex um
um don't see
it is considered a leading cause of death but it doesn't it's hard to find its rank
um the problem with okay so we have a bunch of problems here but the main one that concerns me
is the problem with what i call one thing mind right got one thing we think one thing way one way we
think one one way about one thing and so we think for example that if a if a human gets better it's
because of the mechanical effect of the specific treatments they received from the allopath in allopath
treatments and that can't be true there's no chance of that being true and what i mean by true isn't
perfectly authoritatively correct what i mean by true is has the likelihood of of being relatively truthful
right there's no chance because there are there are literally infinite factors involved in every injury
or disease and every moment of healing infinite every time in fact there's nothing you can point to
in your mind or in language that doesn't have infinite qualities what we do is we collapse a
manifold of infinities down to some derivatives this is called exertion in consciousness then we use
words to refer to the exertions we do not acknowledge having done and pretend that we've
just described how the universe works you just read about that you want to do yes i did actually after reading
some uh a book examining owen barfield saving the appearances um but yeah this is a huge problem and
the funny thing is i'm doing it right now in order to say the things i'm saying i'm taking a variety of
manifolds of infinities i'm making specific purposeful excerptions and i'm presenting to you the results as if they
might be authoritative right so in fact i'm going to argue there isn't too much else you can do
if you're making you know if you're making speech um there's other things you can do like kissing or
taking a poop um or you know pulling weeds or something that aren't exactly the same but what you'll
discover if you even look at those things is that they are also collapsings of manifolds that result in derivative
exertions how would you differentiate that from just generally the word for um uh generalization
how would i differentiate it generally from the word generalization that's a great question
i really like that i mean how would you how would you or how would you excerpt it right do an
excerption for the from the i mean everything i mean i i know what you're saying is true i mean but
that's the whole i don't know that's getting your good feedback you're getting feedback yeah are you
no anyone else hearing that yeah i heard some feedback i think nancy's voice was echoing back through
karen's uh oh okay yeah hopefully this will help so i mean i think it really comes back
it managed
i think we just lost nancy there
i don't know it says i'm a moderator really that's great hi i love it does anybody
yeah
oh she's gone again
i'm gonna i'm holding on to my thoughts because i do have some that i think are
relevant but i want to wait for nancy to come back
welcome back
thank you
yeah i was just um
i'm getting feedback yourself i'm still hearing it yeah i am i'm hearing beyond voice
okay well i won't say much
okay let's do an experiment let's do an experiment i'm gonna mute my mic
and then you talk and see if you hear the feedback
that makes sense um not hearing the feedback now so maybe that's what it was
but at any rate just quickly to say um you know i think it again we come back down to the same thing
i think in essence it's all one we're just trying to name things when we break it up for
our usefulness and for fun and appearance you know to deal with physical reality and um
this is the kind of thing that we have to be very careful of remembering that and re-
dash remembering what we really are and who we really are that we literally are all one and this
really is all one and that this what you're doing what you're saying what we're saying is basically
to be very careful about how you say things so you don't forget i think that that's something
okay all right um i'm gonna respond now let me know if you start hearing feedback again nancy i'm
going to try to mute my mic when you're speaking um because i'm recording i've muted mine i've muted
mine in the meantime okay right all right so first of all um language itself is a problem but like
technology we're not going to get rid of it so we need to use it more intelligently together um yes
what i was saying about manifolds is a generalization but what unlike most generalizations it's a
hyper generalization because it generalizes the fundamental thing that must be done and surfaces it
in our consciousness right it generalizes and surfaces it in consciousness a fundamental activity
that we're not aware we are doing which is the collapsing of manifolds of infinities
in incognition to produce communications uh facts and writing and so forth and theories and
models and all these things right so all of it everything so um it's very useful to be aware of
this because what determines the outcome of excerptions like um you know the relationship between a and b
for example uh if a is a leaf and b is a tree what determines that relationship and its characteristics is not
logic it's the purpose for which we started making those excerptions it's the purpose that we had prior to
emitting speech and if we become aware of this and pay close attention to it together we are capable of
acts of intelligence that are far beyond what ordinary people ever get anywhere near
um so it's not just that it's a generalization it's not trivial it's not a trivial generous generalization
it's a monumental generalization it's a hyper generalization because really you can't even
generalize if you're not doing the thing i said about the collapsing of the manifolds and excerptions
so the collapsing of the manifolds and excerptions is not actually a generalization it's a meta
generalization or something like that now i want to go back briefly before i lose the topic
and talk about this weird stuff with masaru emoto and one of the mistakes emoto made i think
is to suppose that his research told us what was going on quote with water unquote
um and once again we have this problem where the humans are thinking of themselves as separate i'm
not having any effect on this right um the water has this property by itself of this kind of memory
so that if i speak to it of love it forms a certain kind of ice crystal
and if i speak to it of hate it forms a different kind of ice crystal and so forth
water now all that's very interesting there were problems reproducing emoto's work but it's not
surprising if we understand the outcome of his research as having been a conspiracy
between emoto emoto's felt sense and ideas about water
and uh water itself and the specific circumstances under which his research produced results
is
nice to nice to see you man nice to meet you um nancy's here naoko's here you know beast uh rick
rick rises here i'm really interested in the effects that consciousness can and does have on
what we call matter and energy like for example with the so-called placebo and nocebo effects
you can have a person who basically eats enormous amounts of junk food versus someone who eats
extremely healthy but in some cases uh the former's consciousness and the latter's consciousness will
project onto the body and relate to the body in a way where the person eating the terrible diet will be
measurably healthier over long amounts of time compared to the one eating the super healthy
diet etc or like
when it comes to medicine you can have remarkably similar circumstances um where two people will
receive this like the same treatment for basically the same disease one will recover enormously and the
other will uh deteriorate or die and consciousness itself and the way
it projects energy onto the body and through the body seems enormously impactful on
not just health but like how would i put it many aspects of the way the body functions
that's absolutely and it's just curious to me how
two seemingly similar or same circumstances can lead to drastically different outcomes
all things considered that we can consider anyways um
um what occurs to me is that um
that it really has to i mean the factors if you want to look at it as factors and i know you don't
look at things mechanically in that in that way i do of course i do no i was no i was i was actually
i wasn't actually saying to you but oh okay but also but also but also but also to you i guess
you know basically um things aren't all quote unquote mechanical or if they are mechanical
the mechanics are affected by so many things you know that mechanics are just the maybe you want to
call it the structural element of something which basically created the structural element or is
you know a structural element that we you know either not aware of or i mean there's so many factors
in everything infinite almost in anything that happens including diseases i mean we've built up a
certain way that it's pretty assured that if you're going to eat you know fried food 24 7 it's going to
take a toll you know i mean your body wasn't meant for that but of course there's so many elements
that are involved that you can't possibly address any but the very grossest of the aspects in any one
way i think it seems like consciousness is so certain aspects and projections of consciousness are
so closely correlated to the body and actually in some ways the environment as well that
that i have to wonder whether panpsychism which is the idea that everything is made of consciousness
has some merit because this leads me to a whole other rabbit hole but um
basically i don't know enough but
there are there's basically materialism which is the idea that
everything is made of matter and energy which is separate accidental random and non-conscious which
i do not personally subscribe to uh and then you have things like idealism or philosophical idealism where
lives with the universe is done
uh where the universe is contained within consciousness um and then panpsychism which
posits that actually everything is made out of certain expression or layers of consciousness and then
you have things like substance dualism which is that you have two ontological primitives one is
consciousness or transpersonal consciousness and then the other would be matter and energy and they somehow
intersect and intertwine and i don't really know which one is true if any but the sheer
uh interrelatedness and intertwining of consciousness and at least
uh the biological body is very compelling to me
so um i'll go ahead
um
were you recording this yes yes i am
is the recording back on because it just said nice nice to move off
uh i was not able to get the recording happening here so i am recording it locally on my machine
all right okay i am
new york i don't know how to pronounce that name um everything you say is true and not true um
and i come at it from a slightly different way like going back to what you said about uh one guy eating
mcdonald's being healthy we're not eating all the healthy food being not um because um there's a
uh consciousness uh consciousness say if you call it the eater which is the old name right a-e-t-h-e-r um you can imagine that that's a kind of uh a shaping factor i think someone is called archetypes um where you know the seed for an oak an oak tree grows into an oak it doesn't grow into a flower so

that ends up being like um the pattern ends up being like a funnel which you
which you fall into right um so consciously you can create these funnels
which you will be helping no matter what type of shit you put into yourself
whereas in the materialistic thinking um you are what you eat basically
people who things like that they'll eat so they'll be conscious oh sorry for using the bad language
but you know what i mean the so the like the archetypes we know exist because the seeds of the different
plants go into different types of things they don't just grow into um like you know the the brazil
not doesn't grow into an oak tree so that's kind of a consciousness well let's call it uh a mapping of the
eater but us as humans have the ability to to we're one of the few creatures on it to be able to
manipulate our surroundings that includes manipulating the consciousness i'm just throwing up ideas out here
manipulating the conscious eater which means that we can decide to be healthy you know we can we can
our life force we can use our life force to be healthy beings even if we have we're forced to eat
a lot of crumb right
yeah consciousness seems to have quite a lot of potential and abilities that are not ordinarily
uh assigned to it by like in general um not just deliberately using the placebo and nocebo effect
or things like that or say projecting onto the body in a certain way to enable it to become healthy in
shit situations but like more extreme uh like psychokinesis
yeah just stick the stick the material things or effect on material things like your body like
then there's times of um um where you've tried the warrior like trades
and the men will become very physically strong and their muscles will become you know you receive
high definition even if they're not doing a lot of physical work right they will you will notice a
high definition in them right but then there will be other times where the society becomes you know
they have less risk so the whatever whether it's consciousness or hormonal effects means that the
people will become softer looking right well like like the change now
well let me just ask i mean i'm of the opinion that consciousness is a priority to matter in other words it
in other words it isn't that matter develops into consciousness it's that consciousness develops
matter and i you know and you've probably i don't know have you read a rupert sheldrake at all in
terms of his like morphogenic fields and that kind of speaks to i think what you're talking about that
is that there is kind of a field a consciousness field and that consciousness field could be funnels
for a particular group of people under certain circumstances even kind of what you were talking
about too i don't know if that what you think about that or if that makes sense what i'm saying but i
i mean i just think um that makes sense from what you're saying and i believe you know and and that
consciousness is actually a priority so to quickly interject i think that one of the problems is that
consciousness is so multi-layered and multi-faceted that as a regular human born with amnesia so
kind of disconnected from infinity in many ways that we generally are not aware of uh are not surfacely
aware of in our waking state uh like 99.999 percent of consciousness so we get this very like extremely
narrow kind of myopic experience of consciousness that only contains usually the five senses
and thoughts and emotions and bodily sensations and things like that but um in my experience there are
at least there are more layers to consciousness than just the ordinary surface waking state and
the dreaming state and it just keeps going deeper and deeper and uh accessing them is kind of difficult
for an amnesic like it can take years if not decades of practice to
become thoroughly and specifically aware of the details of those other layers of consciousness and
that's a good way of putting us but i wouldn't um i wouldn't denote a prior a priori to any one over the
other let's let's look at it like the yin and yang right and people forget between the yin and yang you
have the qi which is the potentiality so you can imagine the yang being or material being the yin being
energy and then the qi being consciousness like all is one and one is all it's like that holy trinity you
know i don't know did you ever hear about um monroe institution because he's known robert monroe yeah
absolutely and um he's um you know reportedly whether it's true or not been communicating with astral
beings right but they they were living in culture consciousness but they were um envious of us that we
had physical bodies and then we we didn't realize how lucky we wanted to be and if you look at all
the real religions of the world at the moment most of the majority uh major ones the the main outcome
you want to reach is pure consciousness of being in heaven and light in heaven you know so there's
i i think it should be looked at you know the consciousness that come before matter you know
you can argue this and that but the fact of the matter is there is matter there is energy and we
know there's a supernatural well between different um experiences different people have had so that's
like the yin yang energy yeah i don't know which is true if any whether it's just all some form of
consciousness because they're different like there's personal consciousness sub-personal and
transpersonal things that are not even physically dependent um and substance dualism would posit that
you have both ontological primitives matter energy and consciousness and
and really i just don't know in my present state which is our priori if any
i'd like to uh sorry
um so i want to introduce a few things one to circle back to the water thing briefly very briefly
i posted a link in the chat to veda austin's facebook page veda is a water memory researcher she had a
near-death experience and has developed a method of flash freezing water after exposing it to some
physical object and the results she obtains to call them shocking would be the wildest of understatements
it makes what emoda was doing look like i don't know playing with silly putty or something
so for example there was a photograph by someone she trained yesterday who um simply exposed a petri
dish of water to her uh fingertip and then flash by holding her fingertip above the petri dish okay
and then flash froze the water and it's blatant it might as well have been a photograph in ice crystals
you see the exact structure of the fingertip in the frozen ice crystals of the water after the
fingertip being held above it for a few seconds and then you know a billion other well many thousands of
other examples of this so i just want to point that out to everybody because veda's work is really trippy
i'm going to try to get an interview with her i don't know if i'm going to manage it yet but i'm working
on it um so as far as that goes i find that quite fascinating i don't think veda is making things up
i don't think she's phony quote unquote by the way that word comes from the sound of the difference
between the sound of an actual human voice then the sound of the human voice heard over the one
of the initial telephones that's where we got that word phony from um so i'll drop that topic there and
return to where we are now which is the relationship between what we've been calling consciousness and
matter and and beings and so forth uh i think it might be wise for us to select perhaps to select a
different word than consciousness we might even have to make up a word and what i want to indicate by that
word is the more than merely living intelligences the origin of the possibility of minds and awareness
because consciousness as a word can can be easily misunderstood as a sort of mechanical level
thing like you have what something like awareness at the top or maybe you know a word that we need
to make up which is what i'm arguing we have something at the top then you have awareness and
you have consciousness and you have cognition which is thinking but there's something truly amazing that
i noticed while mick was speaking and thank you so much mick for showing up today and hanging out with
us really appreciating that um which is that when when he started to say the thing about physical stuff
and your muscles and things and them responding to your intention or your desire or your imagination
there's something actually much weirder going on that's blatantly obvious right i am reaching out
at this moment to pick up a glass of water and i'm drinking it okay so that that action tells us directly that awareness
the human body is is like a platform through which awareness can organize physical matter i just did it
in the simplest physical action between my hands and some objects
i am reorganizing matter with awareness so if anybody thinks if anyone objects and says oh that's some
of the metaphysical blah blah the fact that they can even move their vocal cords to object is an example
of exactly what i'm talking about so i would like us to have some other word for the stuff some other word
than consciousness because that can be misunderstood and what i want to mean by this word we could you know
maybe um maybe certain philosophers called it uh stuff like things in themselves or that which is but
that's not descriptive enough because what i mean is a more than merely living superposition over the
possibilities of awareness consciousness intelligence cognition i mean a primordial feature of
all that exists and much that doesn't exist physically which is informing in it goes into things and
from within informs them and we might we may come up with a word or i might suggest one in a minute but
before i do that um there's also a secondary problem which is the humans think i'm acting from inside me to
outside things and what i'd like to suggest is that the idea of outsideness is delusional there is no
outsideness outsideness is an artifact of the perspective from which we are participating and
and thinking about and thinking about these matters there is no outsideness
if and you know earlier uh nancy was saying things are
everything is one yes everything is one but
everything is also distinct and 19 other things that it is impossible to formulate in english
right so you know everything is one and there are distinguished uh quote unquote separate beings and
and and and and 19 other things that we haven't figured out how to surface in consciousness or
describe to ourselves yet so for the moment we can call this thing from which awareness and consciousness
and intelligence and cognition derives uh or localizes we can call that thing x but i want us to make up a
word for it um and any suggestions would be welcome
i realize consciousness can be a very vague term and can mean many different things to many different
people but i kind of like the term as well
that's quite a term
what was that
what was the term that you said you liked it got obscured by that whatever that was uh i i like the
term consciousness as well um it's just that it can be and is misinterpreted or tends to mean different
things to different people but well let me just throw this into the fray i mean consciousness
of what and what is conscious in other words i mean i think that a lot of religions and throughout
times i mean i have god raw is it is it consciousness being conscious of itself that that causes the split
that causes all the many other things i think i don't know if anybody here doesn't feel this way but
i know what you what you were mentioning you know what you know george was mentioning is basically
that um that it's both and it is both it's but it's it's it's the one and it's everything else
that's forming information pre-formation but but i think the whole consciousness thing and i'm not
sure about you know how to describe it either you know it has a lot to do with maybe you can use the
word awareness but it's that's not really enough i mean the consciousness when i think when i said
that consciousness was a priori to matter what i was saying was that it is that which is
all perhaps aware and where that awareness goes maybe goes into the many many things that many people
and many everything that exists i don't what i mean by it is uh like subjectivity direct subjective
experience what it is like to be so and so or
how would i put it
that which experiences maybe so that which is aware that it's aware of something is that not what that
which experiences is
or is it or is it the direct experience without this subjectives without the self-awareness
i think it can exist in many states uh with or without a self even with or without awareness because
there can be existence and things happening and a total lack of awareness of it and then
later on in a different state of consciousness you realize that all of that was going on
but there was no uh personal awareness of it at the time so
that makes sense that's your personal consciousness that you're talking about but i guess what i'm
talking about is i think there's like we're talking about it everybody's you know that there is there
is consciousness you you were talking about earlier how it was you know how the personal and different
levels of consciousness something you know but but i think that the consciousness that is transpersonal
or you know there are other there is your own company i think i think we're all personally i think
we're all gone period and that we're all we are all this larger consciousness kind of dumbed down if
you want to put it that way forgetting if you want to put it that way that that's what we are or whatever
and we're having this experience clearly we're going to be on this phone call together but i mean
there is something else which exists i think when i say consciousness is a priori i'm talking about a
different that the consciousness that we are all part of that's basically not personal consciousness
definitely there's something like a collective um a collective consciousness that is not ultimately
separated at root layers although it contains multiplicity so as darren said it's both one and many at
the same time but uh yeah i used to believe many things
and now i'm not so sure about many of them
yeah just to be taught one of the things there if we were god we would be able to describe what it is
is so i don't think we are the whole like it's like maybe we're like a leaf on the tree that leaf
claiming to be the tree yeah is a bit superfluous because he'll fall off in the autumn just like we
die and wither no that's that's that's nature is it possible that the tree is claiming to be the leaf
no i think i've never seen a tree make a claim yes but like it you know it's this thing to say that we
are god you know we're part of it but we're not we're not the greater consciousness you know to me
we're more like belief on the tree we're just we're part of it that is a greater i think you i think
you're right but if you look at the whole fractal pattern that exists that you know the mantle brought
and everything that is you know as above so below how does that work you know how is it that as about
i mean it's the it's not to say that i am a god you know would be god that controls everything but i
think that i don't know what god is if god is not part of everything and and we are not part of god so
yeah okay there's there's a huge problem here with parts and holes um
and you know whether or not we are god is a similar question and i can show you directly how
shockingly similar this question is to whether or not my hand is me
because certainly my hand isn't to all of me and yet without my hand i'm not me
it's very complicated this is a problem in thought and in language and in concept
and the problem is what is the difference between a and b
and as i said yesterday the difference will not be found it will not be discovered or articulated
in a simple fashion because what determines the difference the difference is not predetermined as
we imagine in language the difference is produced by our relationship with categories and identities
in thought conception and language the difference is not in the things the difference is in our mind
and the difference is produced by the purpose for which we make
excerptions producing thereby seemingly discrete entities which we then refer to and compare and evaluate and
analyze
yeah um i'll just take a step back for what you said with that hand in the body or the hand in you
um if you lost your hand you would still live on but if the hand lost you then the hand is finished
so like there are differences between the character and the whole
yes i mean that's a very insightful uh figure that you produced there mick however the figure is not as
authoritative as it appears it's crafty your figure is crafty and and i acknowledge and appreciate that craftiness
and yet um what it really comes down to is what we mean by hand and darren it's not that
so we we've often heard people say that like if i lose one of my limbs i'm still me
and like you said mick which i've never heard anyone say if my limb loses me it's done for
right which is a really interesting twist on that um but it's very complicated it's not simply true
uh because for example when a feature of a unity quote goes away unquote right um
um and by the way it's mono m-a-n-o mono e mono uh which i think means hand in hand when a feature of
unity goes away from one thing let's say um let's say a not real person a person named amygdala uh loses
their hand um and we'll pretend that they are like a real person uh even though they're imaginary i'm doing
this figure on purpose um when when that person loses their hand it seems to have become separated
from their body that which disappears in one place appears again somewhere else
it seems to me there's there's like this weird thing which isn't exactly one of the laws of thermodynamics
but it's something like elements of a form cannot actually fully go away
they may disappear from one place or time but they're nonetheless present in others or even
that which departs from one observed context appears in some other context observed or not thoughts
that's archetype that that mick was talking about earlier i mean i think i mean yes of course the hand is a
morphology and and you know a chair is a chair is a chair even if it's a different form but i think
you know i don't know that that's actually i don't know i don't i guess maybe i don't know how you mean
that if you don't mean if you don't think of it the way i'm mentioning it
it is kind of interesting uh to do a thought experiment that goes something like
what makes me me or what what does the intactness of self consist of like if am i
am i the body in entirety am i the brain am i an eye if you take like am i dna so the consciousness
witnessing it if you come at it from an analytical perspective and take it all apart you can't really
distinguish any one such part of self and say this specifically is what i am or who i am
um it seems to all be like a synergistic interconnected whole of well at least on the cellular level i think sentient beings um
and
yeah when a part of us like a hand or an eye or a limb is suddenly severed or taken away
the
the person the being is still there but in an altered form
the person is still there but it's still there but it's still there but it's still there's a
well i mean what i know in terms of like for example there's a quote from the bible which goes
that they're left if your left arm offends the cut it off well what that means is but there are lesser
parts of you and there are non-lesser parts and you know you can still it's like the monty python thing
where they in the whatever that was the one where the guy keeps getting his arms and legs cut off and
he says come on i'll fight you i'll fight you well it's the will i would say of that person that
still exists i mean look at um you know anybody but without their physical parts or who you know
they're still really just as much them it's it's their consciousness if you will or their and their
will and their connection to their own the larger awareness hopefully um you know that determines
who and what you are and how you um remember who you are um but i i mean i just think of course
we're in a physiological form that's functional as are all the other animals for for existence on the
planet but i i don't know that i personally would spend too much time wondering if a hand was missing
if you're still you to me it's kind of an obvious thing you are although i would not necessarily
consider the parts of myself lesser or greater like it's a perspectival thing
okay
but uh i want to come back to what darren just said about if one thing disappears in one
context it reintroduces in another uh what do you mean by that exactly
i guess he's absent or muted
i'm sorry what was the question i was away from the keyboard for a moment
uh no worries uh i wanted to ask you about what you just said regarding if one thing disappears in
one context it reappears in another right so consider uh the fact of drinking water um i just took sip
from the glass of water on my desk this is all the construct in language what is actually going on
it has nothing to do with what i just said nonetheless the water disappears from the glass
and appears somewhere unobserved inside me that's what i'm talking about right fundamental simply
we don't have to take wild metaphysical leaps into the stratosphere to understand the principles
that underlie um our experience in our being nets right so like can is it possible to let me just ask
you this question is there anything i can do in the walk to the water in the in the glass
that causes it to actually go away
if it were to go away go ahead oh i was saying hypothetically
you could invent a technology that i'm getting a lot of feedback
that these
what they need
do
is
hold on hold on hold on sorry um naoko hypothetically you could invent a technology that what
i got kicked out uh that completely neutralizes all of the energy that the water consists of and so
would effectively remove its form from the universe uh yeah i don't think so i mean you
could say in a thought experiment but i'm asking for something i can do to the water to literally
make it go gone like not be and there isn't anything like that i don't think it's possible
to make the water be gone and if it were gone where would it be gone to go ahead mick
yeah i think you actually what what you're what you said previously is a very interesting
um point about like with the water there's memory in water they say true only appetite
you put on the link to the woman earlier via austin right so we say when i talk about your body
this brings us back to consciousness say when you you with a certain vibrational frequency as you as
you live now right um and you attain a certain vibrational frequency in your your life a life
force and then when you die does that your and you decompose does that life force go with the
different molecules of water that were in your body into the ground and it can be reborn
and back you know so it's it's it's kept in in consciousness because that's the term we're using
um basically you know it lasts into the future generations and is born again
i don't know honestly uh there seems to be at least some evidence for reincarnation actually happening
although i don't know i i i didn't want to talk about reincarnation i was talking about
just in the because what we were talking about earlier about consciousness matter energy which was
a priority like that your conscious free life force which you have during life
is that disseminated through the molecules that break down when you die and it's retaining them
so it's not just pure matter of water the water is retaining your consciousness
and can flow down a river or it can be within another being like a fish
you see what i mean yeah i don't know well what about now i mean if you first of all this matter
energy thing is kind of a false thing because we all know scientifically even that that matter
is just a concentrated form of energy so it's not like there's no it really isn't like they're
dualistic it's just we think of matters things you can see physical things but really i mean we know
just from you know einstein and the bomb you know that that that matter contains tremendous amount
of concentrated energy in fact that's what it is but apart from that i mean i think you know that you
know that what we are i mean if you love somebody right and you send that love to them and you feel
that love with them that is energetic right and that exists and and personally i think we're energy
riding around in meat suits you know and consciousness riding around in meat suits and we've formed into
this physical reality that's come from but the bottom line is i mean i would say of course you know the
the energy of you still exists i don't think it could be destroyed and i don't think anything could
be destroyed in that in that sense i i mean i just think i don't personally think that at all so
although i am very versed to the idea of calling the body a meat suit as it kind of
dissent being like dissent beings it uh no it's brilliant it's brilliant i don't mean to denigrate
the body at all just wanted to say i say it deliberately that way just to distinguish
to just so that that shock actually even exists out there for people to think is this you know is this
body all i am of course so i mean the reason i say it is kind of for its shock value of course i'm not
denigrating it in any way or thinking it's separate in any way from our purpose or a function or who we
are incarnate at all just i think the body gets misperceived uh and misinterpreted like all the time
by regular amnesic humans like me um it seems to be a collective of sentient beings trillions of
them or quadrillions if you count the bacteria and from one perspective anyways and
somehow
perceiving and relating to the body as if it were just a separate non-conscious piece of meat
causes the body to reflect that and so it kind of it has a degrading effect i find
not that that's what you were saying but just in terms of the terminology itself
well the reason i also use meat suit is incarnate is a word and what incarnate means is in meat right that's
the incarnate and carnate is that and of course the body is has all the brilliance of all the beings
that exist in it and everything it's just because when people think and i don't accuse you that this
or believe you believe this or anybody at this call believes this but the you know if people get lost
in the physicality of things to to the point where they don't realize it it's kind of almost a wake-up call
to say no it's not it's not just even the organizing principle of this amazing morphic physicality that
exists in humans in every other animal every other being every other piece of every other being it's
not just that it's what's in it it's what's it's what's it's the reason for it being in the first
place so that's the reason why i do it it's like i say it's a little bit of shock value but it's actually
within the the idea of of the terminology incarnate
i think we've gotten a little bit distracted here so back to mix uh question about whether the
molecules in the substances presuming that molecules are you know actually there which is not entirely clear
um in our bodies when we die go to other places um
they certainly do if you know in in as much as we have a model of what happens to molecules and
their transformations um what that means is hard to understand and that model
actually is really helpful if we're looking at a single molecule or we're trying to build a molecule
say a protein or something like this but it gets pretty weird if we start including many molecules now
it becomes really difficult to tell what's going on over time and weirdly one of the bizarre things about
science is that it seems to be many branches of it are very concerned with prediction and this comes
down to something that's fundamentally human which is a problem that we all face we're facing it right
now even as we participate in this meeting and the problem orbits um three pivots that i will call vigilance
ambiguity and prediction and ambiguity vigilance and prediction are tightly linked right because when
there's ambiguity our vigilance will tend to rise because our threat um sentinel will wake up and the
reason the threat sentinel is waking up is because it's trying to figure out what's going to happen in
the future a lot of science um is oriented toward this task of making predictions and thus determining
whether a model of a physical system or a relational system or a biological system or even a psychological
system in the case of psychology which is not really a true science uh we're trying to understand
what the you know the relationship between the model and the thing is that's being modeled and also
we're trying to understand uh how past um past situations produce present situations and lead
to future situations so we're trying to be able to make predictions um certainly the molecules in the body
uh are quote unquote recycled by quote unquote nature none of us having any idea what nature is
uh we know what we mean i think we know in a trivial or clumsy way what we mean when we use the word
but um we mean all that is uh however i would usually distinguish between
nate things that i see as natural um which are things that were not produced by human beings having
become catastrophically addicted to the engineering production of machines to me machines don't look like
part of nature i can understand someone who says no everything that is is nature so machines are
included i get it i get the argument but i think it's important to make a distinction between something
that offloads entropy into living systems and something that's relatively negative tropic which
the biosphere is um in any case so i realize i've you know made a very bird walkie movement here yes the
molecules are recycled do they carry the energy of our soul with them who knows it seems if if just
thinking casually about it it seems that those molecules may in a way not entirely dissimilar to how
homeopathy likes to frame things have some kind of energetic fingerprint of us but i don't think
necessarily that i mean i i tend to suspect and think as if there's something like a soul
but what i think it is is really weird it's not a single thing it's like a constellation of
relationships among beings over time with a central feature that i think of as darren
right so instead of just thinking darren has a soul i don't think that way at all i think it's a
constellation effect it's much like a solar system having a star in it right there's this constellation
of beings and relationships and moments and places and memories and futures that is a moment by moment
flowing into and being localized as darren and it doesn't mean i can't have a past life or a future life
it just means that it won't be it's not like a single diamond inside darren that goes outside
darren when i die and then goes boop into another body later and gets reincarnated i think that's wildly
unlikely i'd also like to suggest that all past lives are uniquely yours and so are all future lives
in in in the sense that all of them are you but their relationship to the you in this moment that is
presently localizing as say mick or naoko or beast or risa nancy um the the what's localizing is a unique
near neighbor array of of relationships between all those beings and so every past life is mine
every future life is mine but every future and past life is also yours and they are differently mine and
yours something like this seems to be a bit more a slightly more intelligent way to encompass the question
we have a huge problem in english with the idea of singular possession and like i have my so my soul
has a body called you know this one and i my soul is inside this body okay no because none of those things
are um none of them are explicitly separate all of them are processes something is flowing into me right now
allowing me to be alive and speak and we presume that it's my heartbeat that keeps me alive but it's
not it's something flowing into me and i think it's that thing that x that is primordial to awareness
consciousness intelligence cognition sensing relation experience it's that x that is flowing into me and
it's uniquely flowing into me and it's uniquely flowing into you but it is uniquely flowing into us from
something something that we can think of as singular which is often uh referred to as god or
the one sun that is the inner light of all events and situations thoughts
um i partially agree with you i i didn't mean that um you know our soul is going into the molecule
the water and being reincarnated if that piece of that water goes into something else in the future
and it was more like and i'm going to use the term information energy so apparently our existence is to
learn for the universe to experience and to learn right so we're obviously building up new experiences
for ourselves for ourselves for the relations that you mentioned there down and the universal consciousness
right so or god whatever you want to call it so that information energy is accumulated over time and
and according to some theories the universe is fractal so that can be held within me as make or
a molecule of water we didn't make um so i wouldn't it's just part of the learning and experience
through life that that also will be a relation to the you know the development of the soul in the
individual but that that information energy is you know i just positing here that it could be retained
in each molecule of water that goes through you and you know it forms part of the the the the locale
that can inform other things around you right um like like for example if i take a piece outside
under a tree right and then there's mycelium around that tree and that tree puts up some mushrooms right
you know it could be that the mushrooms if i eat them later say it's gone a certain type of one saying
like aminita or another one that everyone knows about that there could be a bit of a feedback
from the information energy that they saw coming from me when through the tree roots through the
mycelium back up to the mushroom and they're telling me something back
yes do i know
so nick what was your original question actually concerning itself with about the dying into molecules
and them going into other things what what was your what was your concern there what was interesting
you about that well it was it was it was um it was about you when you were saying about the hand
the hand being separate from the body but it comes back to the original thing about which was a priori
consciousness matter energy you know like because we were discussing about the greater consciousness
um
i still don't see what you were exploring with the question but that's okay we can we can continue on
can i just ask if what he was if mick if what you were with what you were saying you had to do with
the fact that you were wondering if everything that's physical that um we're made of and everything that
whatever we experience whatever we we have informs all of it on some level i don't know if that's what
you're saying but that's kind of what i was getting from fears
i was extending down's point about you know the the hand being a representation of you yourself
um or not a representation um you know a piece but also of you you know that that we are we're
discussing about the part being the whole and the whole being the part
um yeah that makes sense i mean the weird thing though is that as you can see my hand is not
actually a part there are no parts to living beings the concept of parts is a um
it's a surgical and uh a dissectionist perspective there are no parts i'd love to see you get one of your
molecules separate from your body i can't wait let's go back to the water the water you drink a bit of
the water the water is outside you you drink a bit it's in you then you take a piss 24 to 48 hours later
back outside you again so there are exchanges
molecules um of molecules of things stuff from your body to and from you
yes if there are separate things we can imagine that yes and if there aren't separate things we can
still imagine something similar we can imagine um unities in discrete processes and situations interacting
together
the weird thing is as humans i can't speak for anyone else but as a human i
i cannot or at least i do not perceive the entirety of the universe in my experience as like one unity so
the mind seems conditioned to separate certain things and categorize them and label them
and assess them as separate even though ultimately i think this universe is probably
more of a much more of a unity um like
when i look at the environment right now the death the glasses on it the clouds outside the birds the trees
it is somehow foreign to me to perceive everything as a whole and everything in relation to everything else
and it's quite trippy to like try and delve into that kind of perception
um is it possible that i'm thinking in terms of meditation and the times that maybe
without thinking about it you felt just felt a sense of of oneness i don't know i don't think you
can think yourself into an awareness of oneness i don't think that's possible i don't think all the
thinking part is the part that we do to divide things up and you know do what darren was talking
about with the vigilance the ambiguity prediction and all that which is the other side of the time
which creates the many things we you know out of the one so to speak you know where we're doing
all this stuff to keep ourselves functional and of course we can get lost in that that sample i mean
to the degree that we forget you know what we're even here for and i really think that a question
that kind of was alluded to but there wasn't you know that never clearly kind of gets out there
exactly is what is the purpose behind us being here and i know you know that nick was talking about
you know the purposes and i think this is true i personally like i said i think we just broke up
because we were bored and we were looking at each other from different eyes so that you know so that
we had the experience and we built on that and you know i think it's you know we've created heaven
out of hell made this thing the hell instead of fun because we've gotten so lost in the in the having
and the doing in order to be that we've been excessive in it and we've forgotten enough experience
of the being and i don't think you know so that's the way that's my take on it right whatever might be
the purpose of the cause of this i definitely don't see it as ethical because we have horrors like
factory farming and commercial fishing and wage slavery and ecocide and abuse and poverty and
famine and disease and enormous just sheer unimaginable amounts of suffering going on
probably not just on this planet but others and just it's whatever the cause or reason is it is
definitely not ethical or anything i mean let me just ask i mean something and i'll stop talking
but you know um all that you say that is wrong i mean and i think this is what i mean religions have
certainly looked at this i mean everything looks at this philosophers religions they don't really come
back down to it but you know if if we are out of touch with our with our experience as beings and it
yeah it is pain i mean budism talks about you know suffering and that is the nature of life and that
is painful you call it ethical i mean we don't need to exacerbate the suffering once we understand that
what we've been doing in the the having and the doing part of our survival when it becomes destructive to
the being you know then it's no longer that is to me the lie if you want to say a lie and i think the
lie can only be spoken of in human terms you know that the lies that we tell ourselves are about what
we really need what we need physically to survive and what we need to do to get that those are the lies
if they are destructive of the being and if if in my opinion the the being wants to live in love and
in and as close to oneness as possible an experience of connectivity whether it's with an individual
that you love or sensing it more externally you know as a as a way of of of knowing that other people
are being taken care of and and wanting the best for them i mean it's all down to the fact that we've
gotten lost we've i mean kind of like i guess maybe the bible describes or you know just like in falling
into i hate to use the word but i am just bear with me you know we we are having these experiences and
we need to re-member as in put ourselves together again who we are and and why we're here and if we
don't do that if we don't realize our reason for being our french like to call it raison d'etre and
the french certainly know how to bring a certain amount of pleasure life you know and and and connection
then then we are lost because that is the the loss is the loss of our own awareness of what we are so
i just find it incredibly tragic that in order to remain physically embodied and survive at all
it is kind of necessitated by nature to kill and eat other beings
with varying degrees of sentience the whole thing is kind of messed up in my view
well i don't think we have to kill evil beings i mean there's a lot i mean have you tried not eating
eating at all well i mean if you're not eating meat and other like you say of sentience beings but do
you think that somehow you're put it i forgot about this but if you've been if you've been that you're
somehow wrong to take up space and to be put on this planet for example no i don't think i'm wrong i just
think that it is tragic that we find ourselves trillions quadrillions of us in such a situation
so so if you didn't want to eat meat and you didn't want to eat you know anything other than
vegetables which i understand from what you're saying implies that there's a certain amount of
sentence do you know that i mean when you do you know are you sure that what they experience that
you're eating them the vegetables would do is is terrible suffering and pain is that are you sure of
that i'm not absolutely certain of that but plants do communicate and grow and respond and interact and
and send distress signals when they're bitten by caterpillars for example and they appear to have
at least some degree of sentience um all right can i just let just bring up a little bit to the point
the tragedy like then what you said no no actually inspired me at all our insight that you know the
if you're looking around yourself and everything is bad you know the cheese are dying you know um
the weather is messed up you know you see broader society you see you know denigration in the cities
those druggies you know whatever fine but isn't that that's that's a creation of our i'm just positing
again again that that is a creation of our conscious being here and that like darren said earlier
we can affect what's around us so we can actually change that so you know to rest in um
um uh sadness about us is not the way to be the way to be is to act for better in the way in the best way
you can i do think that wallowing and suffering and how terrible things are is definitely counterproductive
in that it just adds one additional suffering being to the mix and doesn't really help anyone but at the same time
if i had a massively expanded awareness and was aware of kind of everyone and everything that
existed here at least locally on earth it would not resemble kind of a personal self and and like
a fan or on like the five senses but it would be multiplied massively by trillions or quadrillions
depending on what you refer to as sentient um but again you're lamenting you're limiting your lack of
not being omnipresent not being the the complete god uh not lamenting it just uh
but we are we are like there's like no i'm sure some of you here know that know this but we have more
capabilities than the five senses and the you know the physical beings that we are right so and we are
as being the higher conscious beings on this planet we are the ones that have been given the ability
to make the changes for good or for bad so when we see around us the degradation of both nature
and our living places then we we must find you know we could we could find it putting ourselves
to act on that and make it better absolutely
you know about fine horn right the fine horn i guess everybody probably does that's where they
went and they grew these giant vegetables bigger than any place else ever and you know about talking to
plants and basically this was a spiritual community that kind of did that i believe i don't know a lot
about them but i know they did and like you know i i i don't know i mean if you are a vegetarian or vegan
and you you're not causing any um animal to suffer either through its conditions or by eating it
that that i mean plants are our parents they came first they birthed us their seeds are carried around
by animals eating them so that they can can proliferate and we do their bidding so i mean and the fruits
that plants produce are not suffering from our eating you know you know perhaps who knows but i mean i know
i know there's ascensions of course and consciousness absolutely but i don't know if you need to worry
about plants screaming by eating them because i don't really think that's how it works i don't think
they would be you know but of course loving i respect my experience but
i i
and i you know it's just a continuation of the life
um
i'd like to speak to this problem i've been um
away from the mic a little bit i do a couple things but i i
i know uh naoko well we're we are close friends i invited him to the media
and um
naoko has a specific concern
which i don't want to minimize
however i do want to examine some disparate features of this concern and the concern goes
something like and naoko feel free to correct me
this big experiment that we call existence is bad
it's bad because whatever is organizing it doesn't seem to be concerned with alleviating suffering and
generates a whole bunch of suffering and new ways of suffering all day long every day
i don't think all of existence is bad or terrible or unethical but certainly at least on earth
there's uh there's uh there's just an unimaginable amount of suffering
in many instances of beings and
i don't think it's bad or unethical but i don't think it's bad or unethical but i don't think it's bad or
you know let me address that
somewhat sure
okay so
and by the way i'm trying to mute my mic whenever i stop talking to minimize feedback because i'm
having to record on the local machine i don't have any other way to do it since i was unable to find a
way to cause the recording to happen but nonetheless um all right so there are a bunch of atheists running
around like god's bad because he lets children get chopped up and tortured and animals tortured and
everything's being tortured and it's not untrue that things are experiencing torture that that part is actually going on
i'm not arguing
however we don't know what the actual situation is
if there is even an actual situation situation may be the interplay of myriads of probabilities and possibilities
which i think is probably likely and i can you know i can suggest some scenarios that might be going on
but one of the things i could do is say that um
i could make the leap and say waking consciousness is the cause of all suffering
not god not humans enough none of that in order for there to be suffering you got to be awake
so waking consciousness is actually the the lethal star that causes all the torture and blah blah blah
and i could you know i could make a sophisticated argument around that even though i'm using it
rather trivially at the moment but notice that um dreaming is pretty weird right because things don't
actually suffer in dreams that we can that we can know also i've had an experience of a position in
awareness which i think is probably tripartite due to this experience i won't go in depth into the
experience but um i'll just say briefly that during a sleep paralysis event uh there were three positions
that i was aware of in consciousness one of them was the me in the dream itself which was literally being
crushed together as if there was some gravity source inside my body that was causing me to
compress into myself and my bones were breaking and i was terrified and it was horrible above that was
a position that was an absolutely impartial observer just watching no response no reaction above that was
some kind of an exploding light show vaguely similar to the dow symbol in the colors of a box of tide
detergent that was pulsing and so what i'm trying to say here is complicated the first thing i'm trying to
say is that if there's a god it doesn't go around repairing bad situations in material existence that's
not what it's up to right and similarly you could also easily say that um the sun is bad because because
of the sun there are tortures and torturers and the tortured and and let me be really clear there is
agonic experience in in living beings living beings experience pain there is agonic experience in living
beings but how we think about that requires i think a very an array of unique perspectives depending not on
some authoritative perspective in a superposition over all of existence but rather in direct relational
concern with and for other beings so for example israel isn't a being right that's a construct that's like
kind of like a demon that captures human beings and gets them to do things so is the united states so is
palestine but what israel is doing quote unquote if if this process can be said to be acting and or be
responsible for actions is obliterating humans and like killing children and women and all kinds of
things uh out of some bizarre supposition out of an array of bizarre suppositions that are entirely
unjustifiable and i could say this is because of the sun if that darn sun weren't up there none of that
would be happening or i could say this is because of god this is god's fault god made everything and he
he didn't cared you know she or he or they didn't care to make it nice they just made it possible for
it to be horrifically bad for billions of beings all those things can be said however i think quote what's
going on unquote and it isn't a what that's going on it's a who or an us um so the us that's going on
is very complex and it's the nature of of its origin expression process existence is profound now my own
experience of the this origin is that it is good and ethical and beautiful but that doesn't preclude
pain or suffering or even agony or torture it doesn't preclude rape it doesn't preclude murder
um and somehow in the bizarre uh complexity of that which is of we who are these features of existence
serve some crucial and i would argue beautiful purpose now i know this is a very dangerous thing
to say i get it it's really really dangerous people are gonna if if ordinary people heard
me and they'd be like you're justifying murder and bad things okay okay i'm not trying to justify
anything what i'm saying is there's a perspective above where we normally lurk from which agony and torture
and pain and suffering are intrinsically not merely redeemed they are themselves redemptive
they make a transformation in the manifold of being that is crucially important profound possibly even
holy that doesn't mean we go around engendering them it means that we look with curiosity and wonder
it means that i do anyway i look with curiosity and wonder on the the the pain and the suffering and
the agony and the tormentor and the tormented i look with wonder and loving kindness upon them
and i don't nearly leap to simple um ethical critiques now let me let me now that i've formed that
little you know glass of water of ideas i want to say a couple of other things uh similar to what mick
was saying surely i am offended by beings harming other beings i'm offended when i am harmed i would
like to interfere in or intervene in situations in which beings are harming other beings i am particularly
um upset about what i'm upset about what i've seen going on in the middle east and in ukraine
and in all kinds of places that aren't right on the tip of the news um
one of the things i would say about those things is that it's only been possible for humans to think
of quote the world unquote for a very short period of the developmental time of our species
perhaps less than a thousand years maybe a little bit more and probably more like in the way that
we think of the world that's only been possible for about maybe 300 years so for most of human
history it was impossible for you to know for example that people in distant places were suffering
or that the rainforests of the amazon were being burned down for soy plantations or cattle grazing stuff
or that the humans were ripping the oceanic ecologies to shreds or spraying um monsanto chemicals that you
know fuck up our hormones and our our biological molecules forever um yeah no that was that was
impossible for most of human history and i would argue that we are not set up to be able to relate with
that purview intelligently or effectively or to remain healthy when subjected to the incredible
burden of agony and badness that we know that we are informed of via the media and other people
and this leads to an even worse thing which is now it's always there's always been some portion of
misinformation or disinformation in the media there's always been some spin but now we have stuff that's
pure fiction right it was made up just to manipulate us there's no spin it's all spin so we have that too
it's very hard for a compassionate loving sensitive being to exist in any kind of healthy way while being
aware of for example the suffering that animals are exposed to or the obliteration of the anciently
conserved ecologies or you know children being exploded in gaza i mean there's no way to cope
with that what do you do what do you what's the right move i'm not claiming there is a right move
but what i'm trying to say is we have to take into consideration that we're not equipped for this
and we also have to take into consideration that when we form a cohort like we're doing here which is
amazing and i'm so grateful for it and i honor each of you for being here and your uniqueness and your
your humanness then and only then do we have the ability to become different from what the humans are
doing remember earlier in the conversation we were talking about certain kinds of conspiracies
okay the conspiracy for example between a doctor a patient a medicine and and the context in which
those roles are enacted and one of the things that we are trained to do and that i think it's very
tragic and disempowering is that we act like um separated spectators commenting on atrocity even
when we're here together forming a unity which could actually affect the world history the future
right we're so used to being isolated which is by the way for most of human history impossible
right there's no such thing as an individual a couple thousand years ago and and i don't know
how old our species are but it's but we're a lot older than that so the idea of an individual is a
terrifying idea it's uh it's it's an abstraction a literal subtraction of a human being from everything
that is important to being human and one of the problems that occurs when we are abstracted in this way
and we are rendered into individuals is we think things let me be really clear about something
briefly this whole thinking thing thinking is to a mind as being nailed to a rock is to a bird
that is not what our minds are for our minds are not for sitting around thinking things thinking is a
symptom of isolation what our minds are for our communion they're for forging the third way together in
real time which i like to think we at least have the opportunity to do here and that's something that
i'm always wanting and can do very effectively with a small group or even one other person
um so that that goal post is much nearer at hand than we imagine and one of the problems i have for
myself and i notice other people have it too though i'll speak about myself is i tend to cling to my pet
um biases shoulder chips chips on my shoulder things i'm i was hurt by or or make me mad or i don't
understand and so that when when i get into a group what might happen to me sometimes less so these days
as i'm older now is that i really just play the broken record of my upsets you know the things that
that irked me or hurt me or that i don't understand or that i resent and you know i was writing the other
night after talk having amazing talk with someone and i said them
when we're with people who are largely absent what's important is being bright and when we're with people
who are coming into presence together what's important is to be more beautiful together each
moment and i just don't want us while we're here today i would like if we did something else to cling
to our pet biases and previous positions and resentments and so forth and look you know if it's
important let's let's get it on the table and talk about it but you know we have in this moment this
unique opportunity of being together and seeing and learning together in a way that i think is
astonishing and beautiful let's take the wildest kind of advantage of that to whatever degree we're able
um i'm just gonna i'm gonna add a suggestion that when um people are open about
you know here in this book that they observe you know even if they're not in good surrounds they
observe things of beauty or moments of beauty
because you can build on that
and i'm obviously very interested in um
um what darren is saying about you know this communion of groups what they can do together
it's not just the observation of the of beauty it's the becoming beautiful together with and for
each other in the history and future of all beings i know that sounds like a kind of tall order
but it's not tall at all we can do it instantaneously the moment that we agree
it starts to happen the only real thing that's required is our agreement that we'd like to go in
that direction together and we can bring up and discuss and dissect the problems of the planet
the problem of the humans all the dark things that plague us we can look at those but we'll be able
to see them from above rather than from within and or you know rather than from the perspective of a
separated person inside a nightmare machine and that is how it really feels to be a human for lots
of humans right this moment and to some degree for me i mean a few months ago i met a young woman we've
been friends on facebook for a long time and this goes back to nick's question about parts and what
happens when they're lost and so on um we've been friends on facebook for some time and i saw a a
post of hers that clued me in that something it alerted me that something really bad had happened in
her life so i went to her we'd never spoken or texted or anything i went to her page we're just
faced with friends i went to her page and i saw that um she in november she was in she was on a freeway
and there was a there's an accident up ahead and so the traffic had stopped and she had to slow down
very rapidly and stop her car and she was worried that perhaps people behind her wouldn't be able to
stop in time unfortunately the person behind her wasn't even aware that traffic had slowed down
probably looking at their smartphone or drunk or both or who knows what they were up to
they smashed into the back of her car and shattered her spine she was paralyzed from the chest down
now i've learned some astonishing things from conversing with this woman because what we do
when we converse isn't we we don't just talk about trouble um we we make that third mind suddenly i'm
beyond darren and i can see into the history of her and me and us and the world in a whole new way as if
as if some kind of star was being born that sheds light whose light isn't mere illumination it's insight
and so when we're together i can see in all kinds of ways that i can't see when i'm by myself and the
same is true with each one of you um naoko and i we've had astonishing conversations nancy and i our
first conversation is amazing we've had a number since then mostly here um i haven't had a private
conversation with beast yet i don't think or mick maybe one can't remember but what i'm trying to
get at is you can lose part of yourself and still have it right my friend amber she doesn't mind me
mentioning her name we've already been through this she she has no she can't feel anything from the chest
down she can't use her legs probably ever again right they're still alive but she can't there's
still biology right they're still living biology but her capacity to interact with them with her awareness
ends at one of her vertebra
now someone else that i'm very close to is in a very similar situation in fact i really couldn't be
closer to that person um very similar not exactly the same
so you know the problem of suffering is profound and the problem of part and whole is profound
and we can gain insight into those matters together if that's our goal but we have to carefully
organize i think our motivations because purpose produces process that that leads to
progeny and the progeny are what we think and see and believe and we should be really careful about
that last thing belief except in a pretty limited you know scope of you know i believe that my desk is
physical and isn't going to just become a different thing or disappear in the next few moments um
but yeah we can you know when we bring our minds together with the intention to learn to see beyond
what we've seen before to resist the preservation of our pet resentments and biases and figurations of
reality and existence and humans and so forth then we have the chance to fly and i'm not very interested in
being nailed to the cross of my history or my biases i want to learn i want to go where i've never been
before and our minds you know humans think a lot the humans some of them they think a lot about flying
through space and stuff that's not even vaguely interesting compared to what we've got right here
because what we've got right here is everything everything everyone is here everyone before us everyone
after us every star every planet every world they are right here again it's this problem of the stuff
we think is outside us and we think it's outside in space but we also can think it's outside in time
so i'm just so excited to have the chance to take off the costume of my individuality with you and learn
to see and grow and play and explore together that's what i think is absolutely amazing and i trust it i
really trust that please write this down from the beginning of the time you spoke about it um if you
would i know you have the recording down yes presuming nothing bad happens with the recording i will try
that okay you know what you said about the uh i just seen something recently about how basically living
in a city is psychosis in and of itself people become psychotic literally from living in a city in the
sense that we weren't meant to live with any more than like 200 people that we knew at time because
once you go beyond that people just stand by when things happen that they would never stand by if they
you know were in a circumstance where they knew the people you know whether it's an accident or whatever
so yeah i think if you wrote this down it would be right yeah you were talking about the bystander effect
yeah but it doesn't occur if you're people that bystander is basically like somebody who's not
psychotic i'm sorry uh what do you call it somebody who's a psychopath it's a psychopathic thing or a
sociopathic thing that you become not me necessarily or you but people in general become when they live
with too many people where they feel they can't do anything about anything you know at all
starts locally you know and and i think that you know it's just you know if you you know love locally
and do what you're describing locally that makes a big difference you know and it's really funny that
i used to say this that you said today about your pet you know the pet ideas and things like that and i
i had a real realization this morning and i was thinking maybe they'll talk about this maybe because
there does seem to be synchronicity between things for me at any rate when things are you know true
you know certain sense of the word you know but i can see how my my focus on people's awareness
about being as opposed to doing and having is directly proportional
to something not that isn't true but to my own lack of doing that myself
so you know we're i'm sorry go ahead let's um not stand by let's um as suggested by darren let's
come together in the form of communion of our um giving our life sharing our life force
personal attention and good intentions towards amber and darren's friend that they may feel that life
force through them and it may aid or improve their situation in some way oh i love that yes yes please
let's just have a moment and direct our communal mind to both of those beings
let's just have a moment and they're healing
let's just have a moment and they're healing
it's easy for me to cling to my isolation and my separation
um now in this phase of my life more than ever
because i'm very isolated at the moment
and yet at the same time in in a way in the way that that being awake charges the possibility of dreaming
in that same way my isolation charges what takes place when i come together with other minds
and almost never do i just stay like oh i'm just going to be daring
that almost never happens like i don't know what happens but it's the kind of a thing that
happens in in a chrysalis or a cocoon not that a caterpillar isn't amazing a caterpillar is
amazing if you point your if you pointed your finger at the sky right and you traveled in a line
10 million light years long across that angle that you're pointing in the sky your chances of
encountering a caterpillar probably zero i mean it's like a decimal point with 10 million zeros and then
a one at the end you're not going to find a caterpillar all right time space is amazing and it's vast
but what it doesn't have is what we got here caterpillars and they make these things we call chrysalises in
english or cocoons and what happens is like when i'm getting ready to to go together with some others
it's like going to that chrysalis and what comes out the other side it sure as hell ain't me
i mean it's using my mouth and it utilizes darren's body and his memories and his ideas and stuff
but one of the weird features of that is that i know this is a strange thing to say
but i have memories of having an angel's mind with mine and i have memories of thinking the way that
angels think and what i mean by angel isn't that regular thing in the bible that's some kind of
transcendental intelligence or maybe even it's the logos and so when we're talking i try to get the hell
out of the way and let the transcendental intelligences that i remember being with
i'm going to be with you to live come and sing and play and speak and learn and grow
and shine light on things and every one of us has this you don't have to be me to have this we all
have this we have like these layers far above our personal identity from which we can participate
in relation in conversation in exploration discovery in healing in wonder in awe in play in astonishment in
in beauty and i absolutely believe in that and i also believe that it i can't stop israel
i can't stop grocery stores and the slaughterhouses but i might be able to affect the situation or
maybe we might be able to affect the situation in a not directly physical interventionist fashion
by how and when we come together and what we do when we do
so
beautiful cut
so we have an agreement here seems like pretty much everybody here agrees and there are some
things that are so amazing and beautiful that everybody will agree you know people say things
like well you can't change the world the humans are all fucked up and they're doing these bad
things and they're not going to stop them yeah we might not stop them we might not be able to
intervene mechanically but what if we changed the valence of the field of the mind of the network
of minds in which we participate by just adjusting the polarity the purpose of coming together
we have these things called churches which are really weird um but but there's something beyond
a church where humans could come together momentarily and just become like so much more
human than they've ever been over the past months and weeks and years and hours of their lives
and like actually be alive together even for an hour and that kind of a thing when it happens it
sends shock waves through the entire network of human minds the problem is we're not we're coming
together for the wrong reasons social media draws us together to like shit or object or you know
be triggered or whatever triggered in one of 19 ways or be primed to buy something or you know whatever
right but we could prime each other for something that actually matters and i like to think that's what
we're up to here and yes i'm playing you know preacher on the pulpit a bit i'll admit it i am but
somebody's got you like the pulpit's there let's let's put something interesting up there somehow
um so yeah human when i was with the angel one of the things it said is and of course it never
actually spoke it just made my mind it structured my awareness
alike with its awareness by its proximity sort of like that morphological field stuff in the
sheldrake thing that nancy mentioned earlier um or morphogenic fields excuse me it structured my mind
by its proximity but one of the things that i became aware of that it saw was that
one of the greatest powers human beings have is agreement and that's what's being mediated by social media
when we're participating in that we're mostly making a bad mistake and if we're not participating
intelligently we're also making a bad mistake so it's not just like it's only bad but it's really
bad in what it's doing to the humans and their the network of their minds we need to do something
different from that um dramatically soon but my point is just that um
when we agree with something truly beautiful that makes medicine for all beings and they all get
interested every one of my ancestral mothers wakes up for a moment in their grave and was like
did he just do he did what he did something so beautiful that it woke me up from you know i'm making
a joke kind of right but but yeah the the beings of history and the beings of the future they are
watching us with great interest and concern and they're hoping that we're gonna like we're gonna
sit up in the crypt of modern civilization and do something fucking amazingly beautiful
they're aching for it that's what they worked and sweat and sweated and suffered for that one
possibility that we could become that the children could become beautiful together and
liberate and heal and adore each other and wake up together and come into insight and awareness i
know this is starting to sound like like a church sermon but i i really believe in these things i'm
not i'm not reading from the script that's that's obvious i mean really you know i mean i know i just
said this if there's any way you can write up the intention i think this is the intention for the group i
don't think anybody would disagree with that but maybe i'm honest voice or objections but i mean i
do think that is the intention of the group and maybe i this is just a thought maybe we could we could
in our initial when people come on board to the group we could have it as that silent connection of um
i mean i'm gonna say the word prayer although it's intention we call it whatever you want just like
we did a moment ago for for your friend and whoever else you know maybe there's some way we can also
create a group mind in our intention to connect and have the right beauty come from the group you know and
that that it's not so much that it's so important that we talk about things you know that you're
focusing on although that could be too but more start with a feeling or start with a connection more
start with the kind of thing that you're talking about darren you know as a as a beginning to you
know if you're kind of start the day so to speak i don't know if anybody's open to that or they think
that's a good idea that's just a bad one oh that's brilliant yes um in fact you reminded me that sophie
used to have sort of an introductory moment and i got involved in that and we should um have a kind
of an introductory moment and also a closing moment and you know previously i was um
i had concerns about taking over the extinctionati distinctionati lord hugh historical pirate ship
um but i think those concerns have mostly gone away and we can just do whatever the hell we want so
yeah we should maybe forge a new um desiderata a new
a manifesto and um and mention some of these things i like that idea
i'm going to walk away from the mic for a couple minutes i'll be back feel free to uh
take a break or you know we might wind up soon if there's no if there's no further interest but um
i'll be back in like five minutes actually i i'm actually going to uh
uh sorry let's see back i'm going to stop now because it's asia and i have to go great to see
see much appreciation man yeah thank you bye-bye
i should go as well um it was very nice trying to go
all right let's do the uh closing very briefly before you take off
so what sophie used to do which i thought was really interesting is she would say let's just
take a moment we'll we'll invent another one of our own sometime soon but let's just take a moment
to be together and wash away all of the history and everything that was said
and everything we thought and felt and just cleanse let's be
free together inside
for a moment
so
good being with you all thank you thank you i you're amazing
i have much love to all of you and do it again next sunday 11 30 a.m pst be there or be
something much love peace out okay
