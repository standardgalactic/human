so I'm here with my friend my dear friend and we've been friends for many years now
and I consider her to be one of the most amazing people I've ever met her skillfulness
in non-ordinary experience and some magical traditions is quite profound and I'm just
really excited to be having this chance to talk with you so welcome thank you thank you it's great
to be here with you and have a little chat and we'll see what happens yeah I'm just um I feel
like a little kid at Christmas time so I'd like to begin by asking you about some of your early
experiences as a child and so I want to start with that but I also want to ask um perhaps a little
bit further on in the conversation about what the what the religious and or spiritual atmosphere
was like in your family but if we could just start with some of your earliest memories of things
inexplicable so oh um when I was a very very small child I mean like a baby we spent time at my
great grandmother's house in what we call up north in northern Wisconsin and that was like the family
homestead essentially and my family uh come from a line of spiritualists so they also incorporated like
parts of Christianity into um their their own sort of workings I'll call them workings and so um
the people in the neighborhood knew that they did different types of healings and so forth
there are stories of them being up in the attic people walking up in the attic and not being able
to see and coming down and being able to see going up in the attic and not being able to hear coming down
from the attic and being able to hear and so I as a baby um spent time in that house with that family
and with my family with my greater family essentially and um you know it didn't seem
really unusual because that's what I grew up with right and so um the only thing that was creepy
you know like creepy in the in the family thing is is there was always a um what I now understand to be
a crystal ball on the um the Davenport and uh in the living room and you know I never really knew what
it was um until I got older and then when I tried to give it away to a great aunt she said no I'm not
allowed to get rid of it because then I'd be cursed so I was like okay I guess so it sits in my
ancestor shelf in my house oh wow you have it still oh yeah I still have it I um there's something
inside that isn't there yeah there's a hand with a rose holding a rose inside of it so yeah um and
then uh my that aunt that same aunt actually had mentioned oh well I have the family spell book
and so um I got some pages of it it was written in low german and then translated by a catholic priest
uh in english and so it's kind of interesting because I have just a few maybe eight or nine
pages of it and there's a lot of like it does not look like a regular you know you know eye of newt and
grimoire you know there's a it's really sort of like lines of almost lines of poetry religious
poetry and then incorporates you know some weird stuff that um uh and even things that are just
xed out and the blood of sheep and things like that so there's like there's some weirdness into it
a lot of symbol uh symbol uh symbols and you know just different kinds of language that you know
something's a little little off and I think that's how people back then kept their life essentially you
know if you were known to um do things especially like healings or work with herbs or things like that
um you have to be a little careful about it and sometimes quiet about it and so you don't want to
necessarily um have incriminating evidence um that's easily to see so um that kind of stuff but for me you
know that was um just growing up I didn't really know anything different um you know it wasn't until
I got to be about maybe like five or six years old when I understood that oh other people aren't
having foretelling dreams or oh other people can't actually see that thing in the corner over there
you know and and that kind of stuff um my family uh it depended on who it was in the family so like
for instance my birth mother didn't have any issue with any of the um you know non-ordinary kind of
things my stepmother my aunt after my mom passed I lived with my stepmom who was my mom's sister
she did not want to hear anything at all about it didn't want to talk about it my grandmother on the
maternal side however you know the mom of both of them was completely comfortable with it and of course
a great grandma and all that so it just depended on who it was and how far they wanted to go with it
um but you know it there's funny incidences that can happen so uh you know one of my aunts for instance
has uh trouble with something and then decides to uh go to bed and because her emotional state was
kind of like wild you know she was angry and upset and just overly emotional when we uh went to bed all
of the cabinets start opening and closing and the you know the front door starts moving and things like
that we're like oh that's just how she is you know i had a period of that too um when i was in my
probably my mid-30s and i was in a really stressful scenario and i'd go over to a friend's house and
i'd say could you please turn on the bathroom light you know and they're like why and i'd say because
i'll pop them out i'll blow the light out if i touch the light switch and they're like ha ha
go ahead you know and i'm like um okay pop you know what are you gonna do you know those are just
the things so flying at uh computers and flying at airports all those things become a little bit
more tricky when you're in that kind of state where it's an unstable mental state where you're
emotional and that emotional energy can sort of get kinetic it's sort of like how um teenage kids
get you know stuff around them tends to get a little wild if they're emotionally distraught and
they they're bent a little bit you know they have that capacity so yeah same capacity more common with
females than males i think i think actually in from like a teenage time i think uh
boys are more common with like the uh the kineticness of the movement of energy you know i feel
that it wears out or most of the time it wears down after a period of time as people get older
and they become a little bit more integrated with their emotions and things like that but i mean
you know puberty is a rough time teenage years are a rough time and there's a lot of emotions that go
with that so but yeah i think um i i i mean i'm an equal opportunity for it i think it could be you
know male or female but from you know um just come in conversations with other people and so forth it
seems like boys tend to have more of that well that's interesting i may have had that bias just
because perhaps i have gravitated more towards women as friends so in my youth many of my friends
were female and i never heard reports from males of this but i pretty regularly heard them from females
oh interesting yeah and it could be also you know the societal um stipulations involved with that of
what's acceptable and not acceptable or what's shameful or what constitutes providing you know
like a guilty feeling about it or you know or openness toward having those kinds of conversations
because most people generally don't want to have you know conversations where they look vulnerable or
weird you know it's true but the women at least among themselves they seem to be more likely to share
this but again it depends on the cohort right like if the cohorts sort of ethos allows for this without
shame shaming and so on then i suppose it's much more likely to um to to be expressed yeah yeah so give
me a couple of scenes from your youth where something that that really made an impact on you and changed how
you thought about it so excuse me i'm getting over covid i'm so glad thank you um so the stuff i say
you know it's going to end up with people going are you sure you didn't bring in a lunatic darren
into this conversation yes i know you but i know you there's always this concern but um in in my other
interviews for example with my friend ryan first diver who's a blackfoot beaver man we're talking
about a 10 000 year old tradition and my friend mark who spent 10 years in africa we're talking about
traditions that are thousands of years old and so i think my viewers are unlikely to be too quick to
just make wild you know judgments and i know you well enough like we sort of when we met we kind
of vetted each other a bit yeah we did for a while didn't we yeah and i had just the absolute sense that
this is a sincere authentic human being who's highly intelligent and sensitive i trust you so
some of that will will buffer out any wild concerns i think but yeah i'm really excited actually to hear
these things right the things that you experienced that left a big impression on you and perhaps changed
how you saw yourself and perhaps your role in life and so on so please sure yeah so there's an example of
when actually my sister there were a bunch of family members in the living room my sister was maybe like
four and i was maybe six and we were in the living room my parents were in there and i think my
grandparents were in there and uh near the fireplace in that living area there was this small squat kind of
creature that was wiggling you know back and forth and sort of making faces at my sister and i and i
look at my sister and i was like you see that and she's like i see that and then we look around and we
were gonna say like hey anyone else see that we realized everybody else in the room was room was
completely stopped emotion like they were like it like we were between the seconds essentially like they
were completely still like animated stuck right and and my sister and i were both like still able to
communicate with each other and look at that thing and we're like i've never seen anything like that
have you seen you know you know we're just talking about it and it's in the corner doing its thing
everyone is still still and then um i think my sister and i were just like hey go and then you know like
we sort of like pushed it out of like wanting it to leave like our intent was for it to leave now i
wouldn't have used those kinds of that kind of language being six years old we were just like you
know get you know kind of thing because what concerned me more was actually that the family
wasn't moving more so than the creature in the in in the fireplace area the same with my sister you
know and so it did go and as soon as it left then everybody else was moving again and i sort of my
sister and i would talk about it you know not like oh my god that was a life-changing experience but
just like wasn't that weird you know and sort of moved on with things and it wasn't until um
that i was actually starting my training with the makers then we were going back into like what's a
weird experience but go back and and take a look at that energetically and see what was going on
that i realized oh i think we really were like stuck in like some kind of time shift or something you
know like there was a there was another like like the the worlds had sort of just sort of collided for
a moment and we were able to see but in the in our world in in you know the earth world whatever uh
that was just this you know millisecond kind of moment whereas my sister and i were in a moment
that made it stretch out you know longer and so we were able to see this animated so
it was it was kind of really interesting to experience like two phases of what we call time happening at
the same time you know essentially having having that experience i think was um really eye-opening for
me uh because it helped me later with understanding things like the nature of rocks and their time frames
the nature of you know like old uh sequoias and things like that where um everything and and the
time frame of something like a mayfly right or it's only around for a day well what we call a day and
so like how these beings experience time in such different ways um it's more accessible to me i feel
because i've had that experience yeah so that's um can you describe what you saw so yeah
so my sister and i you know i've talked about it over the years because you always wonder like does your
memory sort of shift things and so like maybe because your memory well for me it tends to want to
put things into a language that i understand right like the symbols i know or the what other kinds of
things but this was just so completely out of it it just looked like um it looks like a little sort of
dancing fat elf in a way really you know it had a face um that i've seen other things that don't have
faces so i would say you know i had sort of like this sort of human-ish kind of face and human-ish kind of
body um uh but it just had it kept like grimace like making this kind of like weird smile face and
then uh going you know not really words but just grunting kind of sound uh so it was it was yeah it
was kind of interesting was it wearing clothes um it wore sort of like uh i don't know that i would
call it clothes i guess you know it had more like a black uh covering over it i guess is what i would
say and a black thing above its head too so and did its skin have a color um yeah skin was like a
like a grayish white color yeah and did it show teeth um i would see that it did but it wasn't any
kind of like fangs or teeth you know like pointy teeth or anything um and it just had it did have a
mouth um and then i'm you know at that point then i could have uh you know interpolated that oh they
had teeth behind it so did you see its ears no no i didn't see any ears uh yes it had like like what i
would call like um the old-timey crooked witch's nose or it sort of came out
i don't know if it was more beakish or whatever but yeah it was sort of interesting i don't want
to lose the thread but what you said about time is incredibly important um ordinary people think
about time in a very naive way and when you talk about the difference between for example the sequoia
and the mayfly something very profound there but i think the thing that even when we think in those
terms tends to escape us is that there's a symphony of relationships that each have different
temporalities right the mayfly may relate with the sequoia and so there's a third domain between them
in which very elaborate temporal
music and also relation is always occurring in nature um also it's this is just a topic that
fascinates me endlessly and perhaps more so over the past six years so we may return to it yeah sure
um but give us another one another really like super early kind of thing right so yeah um the first
like time where i recognized that i was foretelling things in dreaming uh was when i was about five years
old and um at that time i had a dream that there was like this kind of evil thing that was chasing me and
my grandfather around one of those old timey um alarm clocks you know with the kinds with the little
legs and the the things and so we were running around and this thing was chasing us and eventually
it got my grandfather it didn't get me but it got my grandfather and my grandfather died a couple days
later and i at that point even as young as i was i recognized i'm like oh something evil was going
to happen to my grandfather you know something dark or bad or what's going to happen to my grandfather
and then he died and so then i was like oh there's a relationship to what i'm seeing in my dreams to
what's happening in this world and um it was not comfortable you know that wasn't a comfortable
first time experience or the first time that i correlated those things together and um you know some dreams
dreams i never really have a lot of like when i have foretelling dreams they're not really like
super great like you know darren just won the the pulser prize or anything it's more so like oh your
friend is going to get into a car accident or you know other kinds of terrible stuff like that and so
i had to learn how to navigate um how to not freak people out about that right because if i said darren i had
a dream that you're that you got into a car crash and and you and you knowing me that that's probably
going to really happen you know what good is that right like first of all it's not helpful you know
you're going to be worried um can you have any you know then your question is what kind of control do you
have over um modifying that kind of thing um you know that all of those kinds of things would happen
and so after time i finally learned hey darren remember buckle up when you drive home
right right in direction right right and so i would work it out and then later on and i'm talking about
many years later i learned that you could um i don't know what what you would call it uh what
the term would be but you could enact that dream in this world uh in a fake way but energetically it
would still finish the intent would still complete and so it would sort of wipe the slate clean so like
if i knew you were going to be in a dream that or if i knew you were going to be in a car crash
then um and i didn't want you to be in that car crash i could you know make put you in a chair and
give you a little fake steering wheel and then enact that it happened enact what happened in that dream
and that sort of like uh clears it from actually happening in this world because and and i heard there
was some kind of uh i don't know what kind of studies or whatever that people who think through
um think certain things that that that their mind doesn't know the difference between the reality
and that thinking of it happening i guess and so maybe there's some correlation with that but that's
what i found the hard way or long way i should say you know that's a crucially important insight
that i i don't want to gloss over um there are very few people who would imagine
or engage with dreams in such a way that they might play them out in their waking life
yeah from what i understand um mark twain was fond of having a dream exchange with people in his house
in the morning and after the exchange he would go into a room by himself and play out the dreams with
him inhabiting the different roles of the people in the dream and that's an interesting example of a
very precocious intelligence obviously right but a very powerful idea i think we're um i think we're
missing a lot obviously in modern times we're missing a lot of just meaningful time together
excuse me but we're missing a lot when we when we're not able to share what we've been dreaming
about and there may be situations in which that's not the best idea but generally speaking the humans
i think for millions of years right or many many lifetimes one of the things they would always do
is get together and sort of use each other's dreams to get a read on hey what's what's happening in
not necessarily the magical world but in the world that informs the one that we wake up to
you right something like this so precognitive dreams how about anything resembling an out-of-body experience
or well i would say i mean yeah i had those things but um i didn't i didn't know they weren't
usual like i didn't know that they were not uh that that was unusual you know so i didn't really
make a big deal about it and i i guess i still don't you know um it's hard to explain you know when
you're you don't know you're weird until you're with someone who's not weird yeah right yeah right
it's true right i mean that's actually that's a very protective thing in a way right because
you don't have the feeling that this isn't supposed to happen yeah and so that gives you degrees of
liberty that that are unavailable to people who are busy thinking like you know why is this happening
to me or something like this yeah and maybe some of that is from the way that i grew up right like i
lived with a family that that kind of stuff was just whatever it was just a typical thing
um and there wasn't really any direction uh or training or anything like that you know like
um and there wasn't any sort of like suppression of it either even though my grandmother i don't know
what my great-grandmother was it what her religion was but my grandmother on that maternal side uh was
catholic like hardcore catholic right and so i was brought up through the catholic church
um but i didn't necessarily you know jive with it i just did it because oh you know other people
are going and whatever and so i ended up more like if i were to um say well if i had to pick a religion
it'd either be you know agnostic or whatever but otherwise i follow um a rinza a japanese rinzai zen
tradition for buddhism so um and buddhists might say that buddhism isn't necessarily a religion i've
heard both sides so you know it's more of you can incorporate buddhist principles into other kinds of
religions catholics love to do it for instance so with meditation and guided meditation things like
that or being present present moment kind of stuff depending on your flavor of buddhism that you might
ascribe to but um yeah like i wasn't ever uh necessarily um brought down or you know told not to
talk about it or to talk about it there was just nothing really um uh unusual about it you know if
and i think that helped me because i didn't have any sense of guilt or shame or repression or anything
that might drive that down that aspect of myself down um you know my sister is a very good death walker
you know she's very good at working uh and speaking to dead people and um very good at um her
interaction and relationship with nature and so forth you know i feel like everybody has different
skill sets and so forth my you know one other family member might be more good at a psychokinesis
kind of stuff like moving things you know in this layer um i find myself pretty good at um seeing and
healing and also having a connection with my ancestors for uh things like herbal remedies or i need
something you know kind of thing and then speaking with the ancestors to get that um uh um answer you know
some very practical very practical you know there isn't a whole lot of like you know um you should
explore what the um environment of saturn is like you know stuff there wasn't any much there isn't use
for it you know it's more like oh well i feel um connected with the wind and i look at the clouds and
i can read the clouds and i can tell that scout wind came through and inform the rest of the you know
the natural beings in the area that that rain is going to come through in about eight to ten hours
and you know that kind of stuff the more of those kinds of things seemed more practical for me to
spend my time learning about was there ever i'm sorry does that make sense yes very much so um so
part of what you're saying is
it would be helpful for any group of people who were together and committed to something to have
one or two or more of them that have the special ability to see into
what we could just you know circle with the term non-ordinary uh reality and also um
when something is stuck right or there's a special need then that person can use their skillfulness
to unstick that or um bring resources that could surround that need and resolve it in some way
that's positive and in some sense healthy rather than it becoming very dire right right right rather
than the need turning into something much more um sticky yeah
yeah yeah so like my sister i spoke with her a couple weeks ago she lives about three hours north
of me up in the in the woods right and she has this concern about oh what if it something happens
like we're having some solar uh flares what if emfs happen or something and i can't get a hold of you i
said well it's super easy we'll just contact each other in dreaming you know and then we can just you
know figure out what we need to do in dreaming if you need help or i need help or whatever and you
know so that's practical to me right yes that's just how you can do it then so that way um you know it
it's much easier to pick up a cell phone you know because you can keep going but um dreaming works also
you know as an example that's a really important thing you've mentioned and i have a few
sort of questions that i've bookmarked but very briefly um
is it clear to you that before the humans had something like radio the technology that they were
doing something like that with their dreaming minds or their non-ordinary aspect commonly
absolutely i feel that that was a skill that's been lost and we've lost that for for many people
you know like the average person has lost that first of all it happens there's there's several ways to
get in contact with other people right like so um i could go into your dreams for instance and
leave symbols or tell you stories or have a straight up conversation with you depending on
how your energy would take take me coming into your dreams right so if you were frightened by the
thought of me interrupting your dreams and getting into your privacy then i might send symbols
or something that is meaningful to you or set up a trigger for instance in your dreaming for
for that kind of intent to be fulfilled right or to get that knowledge through direct versus indirect
right um but then there's also the form that um you and i both go into i call it awake dreaming
but you can do it in sleep dreaming too awake dreaming to me when i speak that language i'm
talking about what my people call um uh journeying um astral travel you know whatever kind of thing
basically your your energy moves into another space and and can experience other kinds of experiences
while the body is still in in you know this space and time for instance in the way
so away right right so so say you and i are going to go into awake dreaming and we're we're going to
meet in a another place in another space in time i would call it maybe like a node for instance right
and so um it's a place that we both energetically understand where it is because we have inherently
created a groove to that place with our energy and so our energy is familiar with it all we need is
the cue of like oh yeah let's go to that old um you know um car lot in wherever it is and so we can go
there and end that place then we can have we can interact and have those conversations or whatever we
need to do right but it's not in this space and time necessarily um there are there's even like um uh
you can do this with like for instance one of the fun things i would do with
my husband is uh you can um go in different spaces in the same uh or different times in the same space
so for instance i would say hey kurt go hide somewhere in your childhood like go hide somewhere
in you know some place where you were when you were a child and so then i would jump and look and find
him like in his old house um in you know the um underneath the the sink right in in a little laundry
basket or something you know hidden in there or something so you can do that kind of thing too
where you're just moving in uh different times within the same space or you can move uh out of this
whole time in space and meet in a completely other space but then share the same time and space really
in a in a different place completely or in dreaming you can you know um i i can meet you in dreaming
wherever you are too so you know there's all different ways that you can enter interact it
really just depends on maybe how that person has already practiced or is comfortable with or maybe
what they grew up learning or learn to do through whatever traditions they picked up you know um and
then really if it's more natural to them uh or uh something they've been trained so yeah
was there any skill transfer within your family where one of the someone taught you something yeah um
no it was just mostly uh because my great i would have loved and i still now i do now i do because
they're ancestors um like with my great great grandma and grandpa who were healers um and herbalists and
so forth and so i've learned a lot from them like uh i'm it's kind of interesting though because i don't
know necessarily the words they're using but they show me like um a friend got hurt and they said oh just
go get some of those plants that grow in the cracks of the sidewalk you know what i'm talking about yeah well
they're also on grass go get some of those mush them up and put them in like a you know like a make
them wet and warm and throw them in a wash in a like a cheesecloth and then put it on the wound and
it'll suck the um the poison out or whatever you know suck the the infection out and then i'm like oh
plantain and then you know so i do it and then it works and then i'm like oh that's super cool and then i
look it up and then i'm like oh yeah it's a thing so you know that kind of stuff and so it's kind of
fun i learned backwards for instance um you know like i had learned how to make what was what some
people may call a witch's ladder i never called it a witch's ladder i didn't know you would call
it a witch's ladder but i just knew that if i made these things and put them in this way
and i could get um you know the interaction of the the air and the wind and the earth all moving
together in to push this intent through right and so i would see a picture of it and i'm like i know
what that what is that what do you you know like i've made one of those what is that for and they're
like oh it's a witch's ladder blah blah blah and i'm like oh okay that's what there's the words then
that come i so i don't necessarily know um how to how to really be articulate about it until after
other people provide the context to it yeah and of course the articulation is rarely the important
thing that's sort of the the human group cultural pointers right but the knowledge is um perhaps even
more profound without the pointers in a way once things become conceptualized or systematized
there's a tend it doesn't necessarily excuse me um create a problem but there's a tendency for the
humans in general and maybe even for me maybe i'm talking about myself to attach to the representation
often sort of dead inside right whereas the actual the insight of when you first discover
oh this is what i'm making of this and it does these things and then you make it and you have the
experience of it and you don't have the words and then the experience seems to me to be often so much
more vital not there's exceptions right it's not black or white what is the witch's ladder it's
basically a piece of string with some feathers on it and uh some for me i put sometimes i'll put bells
on it or rocks to kind of keep it weighted and then um the feathers are tied to the string and so it
just looks like um like feathers tied to a long string for instance i guess um but um do you do anything to the string
um i personally don't you know i'm pretty but you know but they're one of those things speaking about
like string and and this is kind of funny because i've learned that some of those things translate
across different traditions right so one of the things that i have always done uh without any thinking
about it is i've always made little ropes with knots in them and then hung them in trees or hung them on my
car or hung them on things where i didn't want the spirits to necessarily bother that that thing
right and it wasn't until and i don't know why like i don't i didn't really i just knew that i did not
want to have things being bothered with like human or others you know and so i learned later that those knots
in trees you know like those little knots are they would also call those witch knots and that just
would keep the spirit tied up essentially busy over trying to work and follow the knot versus doing
whatever trouble it might do so it's like a superstition right that may or may not really have any
relevance but i've it's just something that i knew to do and do and so there are some you know i think
like with other concentrations i don't know how solid that one is as far as like being really truly
effective but it's just something that that you know was part of my family's kind of thing to do
you know i follow so not so much direct skill transfer in the family your mother other women in
the family didn't actually sit you down at one point teach you something no no they never did but
there's a lot of there's a lot of osmosis going on yeah it was just that this was possible that's a
really fun way for me to sort of learn uh was to see what was possible right like oh they can do that
oh then i can do that or i can practice that and it's possible like i can make that you know a thing
like whereas maybe i didn't think about it before um as a possibility or even you know consideration
and then oh you know and then you can sort of move forward with it and push it and then play with it
you know like if you can do this then maybe you can do this and maybe you can do this and maybe you can
do you know something else with it and then really have fun with it so yeah when you speak about
dreaming there's so many questions floating around in my mind so when you speak about dreaming
i take it that i take you to mean a library of skills that one develops through practice
experimentation and working with others that allow you to interact in a non-ordinary way with people
situations and so on this is not what most people think about when they think about dreaming though if
they're thinking about the lucid slice they might associate some skills with that yeah
yeah so help me understand how you would describe what you mean when you use the phrase dreaming in
case i left something out or didn't get it yeah well
uh dreaming is like the word car or bird or you know clothing right it's a very non-specific word that can
have a lot of have a lot of different aspects to it right are you talking about the characteristics
of a penguin versus the characteristics of a hawk versus a hummingbird versus a heron you know like
they all have different specialties or different ways of being right um so dreaming for me is that kind of
thing too and so when i hear other people talk about dreaming i usually take it to mean that they remembered
something that happened while they were asleep and maybe they brought it into this world space and time
and were able to recall aspects of it right so that's what i would call like someone having a dream
and then there is the term lucid dreaming which um i seem to take as when um someone finds themselves
in a dream uh or in a dreaming state and that can be either self-induced or just you know when it's
happening it's accidental or it's that that they just are and then they recognize that they actually have
control in that dreaming state and then they choose to do something with it um or not or just experience
it in a more aware way i guess right so they are um more they feel more like how they do it when
they're awake in that they can actually interact and move as they would as if they were awake in the
dreaming space that's what i would call lucid then there's dreaming that um you can go into a dream with
an intent uh and that in like say for instance uh one of the practices that i learned in my tradition
my shamanic tradition the maker tradition is if i want to know what's behind a certain door
um i can in this layer in this space and time i can go um and think about that door set the intent
that i'm going to get behind that door and dreaming space and then when i go to sleep i find myself in
front of that door and then i can open that door and go behind it and see what's behind it so it allows
me to access things that are in my awake space and time in a dreaming space and time just you know to
see what's going on um there's dreaming like awake dreaming which uh or what i had mentioned before
some people call journeying or astral travel and there may be some shaves and flavors of differences
and how people interpret even those things so essentially they're moving their energy or awareness
um and energy and i would also distinguish that there's a difference between energy and awareness
but they would move their their consciousness essentially um into some kind of other realm whether
it be um uh something that exists um just not in the space and time or within a dreaming space which then
can also be a portal to another kind of space um and so that awake dreaming allow is uh allows for um
in my tradition very powerful um movements energetic movements can occur within that space other people
tend to use and use that as even just um a way for them to get uh inner wisdom right like information for
themselves that can be helpful and that's a lot of people call that journeying right and or met it like
a guided meditation maybe even that brings them into a place where they can get past that thinking mind
for a moment and allow for more of like um um a quiet inner truth to come through and allow to speak and
say what it needs to say um yeah i mean i could do and i could go on for a while with that so is there
anything specifically that you want to yes okay so i just want to give people who either don't yet have
any experience of non-ordinary kinds of awareness while they're awake or they only maybe have a very
limited kind perhaps they've done psychedelics for example and they realize oh there's other ways that my
mind can be that i can still be in sort of the physical world and see the things around me
and interact with them but my my awareness is in a different shape right and um
you're absolutely right about the words right we have these words like food
what do you mean okay it's something we eat okay sometimes right but that refers to all the possible
kinds of things so it's terribly general um when you talk about a shift in awareness
and perhaps um perhaps something that resembles changing the mode of one's waking consciousness
this ordinarily when people hear the word dreaming and look words don't mean things words mean
we just we decide together what we mean we use words to mean things to each other right and so that's
that's the weird part where what does dreaming mean really isn't even a question because it's what do we
mean when we use right exactly right right now what do we mean so um with the word dreaming and i don't
want to get too hung up on this yes of course it refers to nocturnal experiences and then there's the slice
of lucid nocturnal experiences and then there are some other unusual slices of that um and then with with
waking dreaming we probably mean something more like um using our intent meaning what we hope to become do
see change right to enter into um to give our waking consciousness another layer on top of it
that we can move into in which we can act in non-ordinary ways to see to solve a problem
to overcome an obstacle something like this
yeah so there's a broad spectrum of things i wanted to ask you related to this have you ever
experienced sleep paralysis i have not um that's not surprising actually i i've heard of this thing
where the sleep paralysis um but i have not personally had that experience i also don't have very many
nightmares um which um you know i guess that's a common thing that people have is nightmares you know and
i can only really think of just a few in my whole life um and and it was yeah you know but it's not a
common common thing for me yes it's relatively uncommon for me too um there are some occasional exceptions
some questions um um
okay so many questions all right let's go to
oh okay yeah here's one actually i've got a few here okay um and these are questions that i often ask
just because i'm really curious and maybe i've asked you these before have you ever seen the sun in a
dream that you recall oh we have had these conversations yeah um i think the answer is still
no the moon um i think the answer is still no but it's a question because sometimes i confuse my awake
dreaming and my sleep dreaming and my sleep dreaming and i have seen the moon but i'm pretty sure it was
during awake dreaming yeah and how about um a lamp that is on in a dream and i'm talking about sleeping
dreaming yeah yes i have okay a candle that's lit yep okay ever tried to turn a light on in a dream
that you remember i don't recall uh but there has also been fire that has been used as a light
of course yeah fire is not quite as uncommon for some reason so obviously
there's a weird question here and it's not the kind of question that i'm actually seeking an answer to
right because it's it's such a deep question that i think an answer would be sort of a way of getting
a divorce from a question i'd rather get married to which is what okay whatever's going on when we're
dreaming seems to be illuminated almost always but what's doing the illumination yeah right of course we
can say you know sort of obvious answers like well it's consciousness yes yes but that's not what i'm
after i agree i agree there's something trippier going on there and the reason that these questions
first occurred to me is because i've had experiences in dreaming where
okay let me ask a different question before i go here um is it very common that you have a dream that
you're you're in the room that you're sleeping in
it's not common it's not common for me has happened it has happened um because of i'll go layers i used to
practice lucid dreaming because i thought it would be you know kind of interesting to have control and
i was like oh this is super easy but then i would go okay what can i do with this and then i would do
a dream inside of a dream inside of a dream and and see how many layers i could go and so uh it would
get confusing uh because i would wake up in my bed but i'd still be in my dream and then i'd wake up in
my bed but i was still in the dream you know that kind of thing so right layered false awakenings yeah
so often when i have a dream and i'm in the room i'm dreaming there is
there's an unusual situation energetically at least okay one of the things i'll say about this is
i've noticed that there's something like a structure to the to what i refer to as the
dreaming manifold and when i think of this word manifold i just think of a bubble of many bubbles
with intersections right and the dreaming manifold is delicate in that if waking consciousness enters
it in a sort of angular way it tends to burst the bubble right like you know you're you're running
away from a pink tyrannosaur in a 12th century castle you turn around suddenly and like why wait what
and that moment of questioning of both history and also of identity those are two of the angular
things that tend to collapse the dream right um identity is one of the uh key
dream collapsers so certain kinds of questions in dreaming introduce what i call a grunge
that's just a word i made up i love it i love it and a grunge is a like a three-way branch right
usually one of three things happens either the dream will backfill oh well yesterday you ran into
the pink tyrannosaurus when you were eating you know right this kind of thing it makes up a history
that satisfies the sort of intrusive aspect of the waking mind that's forming the question
satisfies it you go on dreaming the second one is like there aren't pink tyrannosauruses this is
ridiculous and you wake up right okay and then the third one is it's it doesn't do either of those
things there's a there's a sort of a between space that opens up that the consciousness naturally
steps into where you realize that's not the important question and i think i'm becoming aware
that i'm asleep right now and i'm in a dream so that leads to something some form of lucidity
what happens for me usually when i when i'm dreaming in the room all right so i had a dream a while ago
where i woke up i was at another family member's house and i woke up and um i got out of bed but i
was like drunk i couldn't walk right and i and there was something wrong with my seeing
it it's i could see everything was there but it was like something was missing from what i was seeing
okay like the layer was missing even though i can still see so i sort of drunkenly stumble down the
hallway to my sister's room i knock on her door i go in she's got a gun we start fighting over the gun
that resolves i try to go back into the room and there's a huge win just like coming back out of
this room in which i'm actually still asleep on the bed and then i get my phone and i try to take
a picture because i can see things moving around in the wind beyond the door some of the phone doesn't
work which is another common thing so often when i wake up in the room that i'm in one of the most
common features that was a specifically strange one but one of the most common features is electrical
things don't work so once i went to turn on my light over there which i actually never use
it doesn't turn on i'm like well let me get my flashlight so i got my flashlight turn that on
that doesn't work at that point i realize i get that the wall thing might not work but this
doesn't work too and that leads to an encounter
what actually happens is i go in the hallway and outside my bathroom door there's a little paper
bag like a lunch bag and the door is partly open and i reach to open the door and as i grab the handle
suddenly i'm engaged with like a metaphysically powerful electrical feeling like tug of war
back like there's a giant impossible monster on the other side of the door that could just you know
rip my arm right off if it wanted to but it's actually just letting me feel its power right okay
yeah sure and do you have any experience of a force that resembles that in any experience of something
like that of forces that are doing like like an almost electrical kind of like really
jiggly is the only word i can because i've had this before right like sometimes i'll grab onto the
string and the string will start and i keep my arms around like this and boom i'm in some kind of
non-ordinary experience shortly thereafter oh cool yeah um i can't think of something in dreaming
that that that has happened um i may i may have to come back and say oh yeah i remember this one
thing but it's also like part of the reason why you might not have this experience is that these
experiences are much more natural to you right so since you're in some way very comfortable with them
and have long association with them they might not emerge in such a dramatic
sort of hyperbole right as possible yeah i mean for me like weird stuff that happens in my dreaming
time is for instance i'll have a dream and i'll be going down a neighborhood and i'll see a building and
then i'll actually see the energy of that building in the dreaming and i'll say oh my god there's all
these symbols and stuff on this this building is something completely different than what it seems
to be in this streaming space this is something else completely i want to get in there and see what's in
there you know and and then it ends up that it has you know i don't know if you remember um or have
ever heard of that they're they would call them um it's probably derogatory term now hobo signs yes
and so like uh folks that are riding the rails they'll they'll put symbols on things to designate
oh this is a safe place this is a place where you can get some food this is a place watch out for the
cops right and so the these buildings would have these kinds of symbols on them so that they could
designate like what was what but um i only saw it you know i only see it every once in a while but
it's the energy behind the actual thing you know so that's that to me is like oh that's a fun dream
you know or oh that's amazing yeah or if i'm in dreaming and then i'm like i see writing literally
writing on the wall and i want to really get a a good close-up of what exactly is on that wall what's
written on that wall and i'll move in and the cursive handwriting will change into a different
language or something then i'm like oh that's interesting to me you know um there was a period
of time where i had been very um conscious in my dreaming of working with another person so they were
sort of like a peer to me uh and the peer the you know the other person and i were sort of apprentices
in a training um and while we were apprentices we were sort of given the 101 class to help train
these other people right essentially we shared this this piece together and so i remember going into
dreaming and then finding myself with that person again and be like oh what are we doing today you know
and and you know like throwing people into the dark uh deep ocean and letting them face their fears
for instance is some is one of those things like that was a practice uh that we just did for like
the normal people you know people so you know and and we would be like oh my god you know how long are
we going to be doing this you know like when can we move on to like the 201s essentially we weren't using
that kind of language but knowing that we wanted to to go forward and this per this peer that i have
in dreaming we've met over you know 20 years uh and so you know i wonder about that for myself like wow
that's really interesting is this actually like um this in this dreaming place in space is this actually
another human that i know or you know like that i don't necessarily know but i only know them
in dreaming and we we have energetically connected every once in a while and we're sort of on the same
path with what we're learning and dreaming uh through whatever thing we're doing so i find that
interesting that to me interests me yes yes so this brings up another topic um we talked a little bit
about radio right and that before there was radio or let's say telephones yeah that we had naturally
humans had these abilities and they were probably pretty common yep yes there were people who were much
better at it than others but everyone had the basic ability i recall a story where an indigenous man
was training his daughter and this is just a story i don't know the man but there was a particular
kind of candy that she really liked to eat and he didn't want her eating it all the time
so he would tell her you know i've got a word in my mind and when you guess the word you can have the candy
and she's like you can't do that no one can do that you know this kind of thing and she would make
some halting attempts and such and wouldn't get it right or maybe once in a while even though she
didn't get it right he gave her a piece of candy to encourage her to believe that it's possible right
like you said yeah right oh this is possible wow and then eventually she became totally adept at it so
that the moment he made a word in his mind being she could say the word yeah um we have these words
that are very valuating words like telepathy or astral travel or you know where we think oh this
is some very special psychic skill if we're willing to believe in that if we're not completely skeptical
about it obviously there are people like darren brown who can completely emulate the things that a
psychic would do just as skillfully as a psychic and then show you the exact techniques he used to
not be psychic and do these things right okay sure so so he thinks there's since there's another way of
doing this that proves that the other thing doesn't exist and is just nonsense right okay and he's very
invested in proving that even though some of the stuff that he does is truly sophisticatedly bizarre
you know this is i'm this isn't an advertisement for darren brown but he's a fascinating individual
to see the kinds of uh scenarios he pulls right yeah be interested in seeing what he's up to because
i've never heard of the guy so like he gets um i'll give you a couple of brief examples he goes
to new york and buys stuff in stores with blank sheets of white paper oh okay sure he gets a group
of business people who have never committed crimes together at his mansion under the guise that he's
going to teach them some of his techniques and scripts them so that later in public in a city in a
specific space that he leads them to they will one by one individually rob an armored car oh okay right
just scripts them to you get these four signals rob the car right okay and most of them do um
some really crazy things worth worth checking into uh but that's that's a side branch so
obviously before we had television if you watch families right they're sitting there uh you know
in trance like watching the tv together we must have had something like group dreaming right where we
went together i feel so i mean you've done it yeah yeah so i mean yes you've done group dreaming right
where you have a mission together or no i will tell the truth yeah yeah absolutely what i think is
the difference now between like you know we're talking about hypothetically you could do this thing
or i've done those things but the truth is that you get real good at it when you have to do it
we don't have to do it now right like when if if it's a matter of life or death yes then you're gonna
you're gonna invest it in it right you're going to really set an intent push your will and make that
happen uh because it could be a matter of life and death yeah we don't have that now and so it's there's
no skin in the game uh per se right at least not as much right yes the older peoples when they lived in
on the land and there was desperate trouble i mean the winter would kill off a third of your elders
every year right so you're highly motivated as a group you live together every day you dream
together every night right you're in the same place together with the same intentions and hopes
and fears concerns ancestral history that you've been living your your people have been living here
for 10 000 years the mountains are full of your dead right it's like the place really matters one of the
things my friend mark said was that when he went to burkina foster in africa he was uh molly done with
sommet's secretary for a couple of years and knew him pretty well and went to africa to look around
and he would say you know their magic works for sure but it doesn't work for me i'm american
right those antlers places where they've been living for thousands of years i haven't been
i've been over here you know my people don't come from burkina faso right he would be like
not everything doesn't work there are people who can make you know charms and things that work for
anyone but a lot of the magic especially when he became ill it didn't it was very difficult for him to
get healed there he had to come back here to get healed which i thought was an interesting side note
yeah but i think we were born for group dreaming and we're just not getting the context for the
i guess training isn't the right word we don't have these traditions
but certainly you have you have the experience of having formed at least a small team and gone on
missions together yes i have done anything yeah um you know and some of this stuff is pretty
accessible too you know like there's there are ways of learning how to do that that's not in a closed
tradition or a hidden secret that you have to know these other things before you do it you know i mean
i've gone through some of the harner training and one of the fun things they did is like okay remember
you've got like this piece of jewelry for this other person go into dreaming space and find that
person based on their jewelry you know like this is how you could where you can find um people who
were lost right um i use a method sort of like having i'll send a um a scout out to spray paint them
a certain color and then i can find them based on the spray paint for instance right so um there's it's
not inaccessible but the other thing i i really want to sort of like bring into this conversation
is it's just not people that are doing this group dreaming right um for instance when you're talking
about the folks in africa they're they're working with their genius loci they're using all the spirits
they're using all of the connections they're having not just a human to human conversation they're
having a much wider conversation and i feel that that is as important as it is to yip-yap with your
neighbor you know like you need to know how is um the weather gonna be what is the where are you know
if you're in siberia where are the caribou hanging out right now you know have the seals come in those
kinds of things and so and all of those things also talk to each other right in ways that we can't
really understand so there there's a um i don't know how to explain it really well but there's sort
of these bands of communication right there's the human band that that's this thick and so humans are
more naturally able to communicate in dreaming space and other types of energy with each other
as humans right uh and then trees and and again the word trees right they have their own band humans
and trees can actually work a little bit closer we're closer together in that whole schema and then
there's like um honeybees you know and they know how they're each language for each other and they
you know they're doing their own dreaming work together and that kind of thing and you know
squirrels and and crows you know how do these animals know how to do the things that they do
unless they're already connected with olive squirrels of everywhere right like how does a squirrel make
a squirrel nest you tell me if they've never been in a squirrel nest or yeah of course the scientific
answer which is a dismissal is instinct or you know it's in the gene what is instinct yes
instinct is that it has knowledge where does that knowledge come from yes and how does it
yes so you're talking about a topic where this is actually the topic that led me to my significant
long-term non-ordinary experience because i began to think of the layer of the humans
humans as in fully linked network that's always changing each of the individual humans right the
network's alive by itself and then there's a network of the trees and the bacteria and the mountains
and the oceans and the sky and the insects and so each of those beings has a sort of a local cognizant
and then their close related cognizant right like the bees are obviously draining with the flowers
yeah at least yep and and also let's not forget that all of those things are made of elements which
then also tie in with each other and are connected you know it just keeps going right like the macro and
the minor the uh micro macro micro we can connect into all those things as humans we can connect into
all those various layers uh through various you know focus and intent and our will right so like
but also through relation right absolutely give them a gift go to them go to the trees give them a gift
pay them attention sit with them make a friend or two um if you see a bee on the ground warm warm the bee up
in your hand so it can fly again right meet the bee people you know you can think of it in like this
just sounds like a bunch of blue okay if you're about to die and a human comes along and rescues you
and saves your life does that seem wooish to you right if the bee is freezing to death on the cold cement
after having lost its ability to move its body fluids because the temperature suddenly drop
and it's dying there and i warm it in my hand
don't you think that makes an actual link not just with that bee but with the hive it's from
and the entire line of ancestral hives that that queen is from and so on so yeah okay go ahead if
you want to dismiss it as woo be my guest you're going to live in a pretty boring world for the rest
of your life but and on the other hand there's stuff that it's very useful to dismiss as woo right
there's a lot of superficial bullshitty sort of spiritual prostitution for lack of a better word
right where this is just you know and and some of that stuff even works because there's some
principle underneath it that is being um surreptitiously promulgated so let's say um
um the secret right to pick one of my favorite examples of bullshit okay encouraging people to
believe in their dreams is pretty powerful by itself okay so just encourage you can accomplish
your dreams we're here to help you do that that's the underlying thing that's being surreptitiously
presented as you have magical power you can just manifest whatever you believe you want a million
dollars you can have a week you know pay me 1500 and we'll make that happen right right so there's
often principles underneath there and this is really common in human culture um it's a it's a weird kind
of virtue signaling right where you take a principle like we're going to liberate the people who've been
oppressed and then you paint over some rather toxic garbage on top of that and that becomes taken up by
the masses and starts pulsing and now the cognizant has this form in it um it's very it's very
unfortunate and common that something i call thrisps right these are ideas that become very contagious
will have a sort of seed of virtue inside them but the actual thing that they're accomplishing is not
that virtue and this is tragic and dangerous so yeah there's woo we both agree right yeah absolutely
i've never had the sense that you were in any way like that you always seemed fundamentally authentically
who you are and in your practices and your your workings and your path in a way that just um
um made me feel immediate respect for you as as a deep um intelligent sensitive human being who's
exploring and who can see right who has the gift of seeing well thank you uh it's yeah thank you right
it's so encouraging anytime we meet someone who we know we can deeply trust um then we can learn safely
together because we have this uh i've learned so much from you also i mean i you know for instance
in our many years of conversation i i will explain something that i'm experiencing and you'll be like
oh well this is also this and this you know and we'll add our we'll be you know connecting in this way
and you're providing extra context for me and i'm learning with you we're learning together and we're
having you know it's just i really enjoy our exchanges and so i want to thank take this moment
right this moment right here and say thank you for that my pleasure and yes i mean we're much better
with another seer than we are by ourselves and um i think it may be common that people who know me
may think darren just walks around seeing these astonishing things all day long every day you
know this is just how he lives his life right there's a little bit of that going on but mostly
what happens is the spark of another seer when i'm near her usually because very few of them are male
to be honest in my life um it just lights me on fire and now i have the chance to begin to see
together for each other it's almost like we need the mission to light the skills up right without the
mission would you you could do things with the skills you can form your own mission yes but somehow
the mission the mute the mission of like mutual learning and growth and fulfillment and overcoming
obstacles and insight right is so um nourishing and nurturing and encouraging and reassuring and
empowering that i just naturally blossom when i'm next to someone like you right i just you know it
really does end up being a one plus one equals three scenario very much so yeah yeah i would agree with
you on that um we can either go i have a few questions that we can't stop without me getting to
them okay whatever you need to do great we can either like take a brief like five minute break
and come back would that be good yeah that sounds fine for me okay i'm just gonna pause the recording
and i'll be back in like five and we'll continue okay sounds good i'm just gonna mute that for a minute
great i'll be right back
so it sounds really you and i have discussed the idea of feral humans before
and in what context if you could remind me yes sure so there are those of us who have either since
childhood or since there was a disjunction in our lives we began to operate outside the culture
oh sure right like and some of us you know like i ran away from home when i was a teenager
i lived in the forest for two or three years mostly inside houses but also wildly i just left culture
i was like forget this stuff i want to know what does it mean to be human you know you can have a
rough time figuring that out in the swarming morass of nonsense and pragmatism and money and things so
and you are definitely um a fellow feral in the sense that you started out pretty much in a way
um not necessarily opposed to the human culture but uh living into your own
and your filial you know your familial um histories and such in a way that really would make you what
ordinary people would consider to be an outsider mm-hmm yeah we both have this in common and some
people are able to preserve certain facets of the many gifts they come to birth with
um i think unfortunately for most of us we we enter something like a slaughterhouse of those gifts right
they just get snipped off and chopped up and punished and not rewarded but some people through art primarily
um manage to preserve some of the many seeds that i think we each uniquely carry
and it's you know both it's one of the tragedies but also one of the great opportunities that we can
help each other to recover those gifts or start watering those seeds again and realize oh my goodness
telepathy is nonsense humans are transcendent by nature right or clairsentient by nature right and this
is the problem with woo is that woo captures that markets it markets it yes and you know it's it's
almost like the organized we have the same problem with organized religions there are something it seems
to me like divine beings holy beings it's not ordinary intelligences that are that exist in nature
and time space itself and maybe the universe as as a whole and the humans are really confused about
this because they're like well you can go at it via science which pretty much evicts all that from the
first move and just wants a mechanical grasp on phenomena so that's probably the wrong way of knowing
you know people keep going like well why doesn't science you know recognizes a blah blah blah it's
the wrong idea right that way of knowing is formed well it has been now for about a thousand years or
six hundred years right when rupert sheldrake says when the division was made and they're like there are
no there's no metaphysics we're just going to get a grasp on mechanics and one of the amazing
things he says about that is the claims in science normally require evidence there's no
evidence right there's lots of evidence that he has found that i think is reliable scientifically
that something else is going on right um animal telepathy anyone who's had an animal if you don't
think that animals connected with their mind like something is off right yeah um telephone at the same
time weren't you brought up like i was told when i was coming up uh that
fish don't have feelings so you can hook them and go fishing you know like you like that kind of
stuff that's what's ingrained in us you know so we are pulled from from our connection as early as
possible in all the various ways even though we instinctively had those things so it's true this
is so one of the um parts of my practice is a linguistic element and i think um language
is hugely important for humans in all kinds of bizarre ways that we're not trained to understand
if in childhood a root principle like um there's a there's a circle of root principles
uh it's not a specific lexicon but like what is the world what are trees what are animals what is
food what is dreaming right um what are eyes uh what is a friend right if you go to people and you say
like animals are not sentient they're just little machines running on instinct right um you've broken that
polyphor in such a way that if that's taken in even um superficially right it not only damages that
root element those elements all link together so the damage in this one is communicated to the ring
right it changes what the world means if animals don't dream if you can't make friends with them
right it changes what a friend is it changes what a tree is it changes what food is right it changes what
eyes are because we no longer see beings you know like in in in the blackfoot indigenous tradition
for example there are stories where um a hero quote unquote the adventurer is another way
is taken to the city of the animals where all the animals have like human forms with animal heads
and the animals city is where all the animals dream together and share um solutions to problems including
the problem of the humans right and so if you don't have that idea if that just seems like a nonsense
story to you then vast arrays of your potential as a conscious being are delimited very cruelly
so one of the problems is that science actually damages the holophores on purpose right it shaves
them down to a sort of mechanistic um skeleton that's dead inside yeah on purpose right it's dead
inside on purpose but it's possible for us through conversations like this and through learning and
growing together and adventuring together in our lives to restore to like just accomplish a modest repair
to the holophore of like what is an insect and that repair goes around the whole ring right all the
other elements inherit that repair so that's a very powerful way that we can restore some of our
um some of the gifts that we bring to human birth um as uh if you want to use the word as souls i think
a soul is a complex thing it's not just one thing right it's more like the solar system of many
relationships okay yeah our souls our being right our incarnate experience our animalness because we
are animals too and our humanness and even then our cognition right the sort of more structured thing
um when i was a child it was immediately clear to me that the adults were broken
the adults around me were broken they thought that small creatures weren't beings and mostly what you
should do with those is just kill them up as much as you can right you know in any way that you could
just get rid of those things and that feeds into you know a complex mess where the humans are trying to
evict ambiguity right our houses do this our cars they evict ambiguity like very predictable stuff so we
don't have our threat sentinel doesn't wake up right right um but i i was absolutely clear that small
creatures were fully fledged beings when i was a child and that got me in trouble occasionally with other
humans especially if i tried to show boys particularly that these beings are beautiful and
intelligent and fully fledged beings the boys would just often just kill them just right now because
it's a threat to their dominance their prowess their masculinity these are pretty toxic versions of
those things but yeah it got got me in trouble um so it is possible to repair these elements and
non-ordinary experience is one of the most amazing ways to begin to do that together especially when
we're authentic we've developed woo resistance right so we're not going to woo out on this stuff
um we test what we're doing we check it verify verify yes so this is something that i love about you
is that i know you to be someone who is a careful experimentress um in that
your biases don't lead you to deceive yourself you check pretty carefully when you're testing a skill or
ability yeah yeah and that's something that i rarely encounter and it's something that i respect about you
um it's going to be a bit of a sudden shift here unless there's something let me give you one just
okay okay so who was the first teacher that really impressed you and you were like oh wow
now we're on to something together um my zen teacher probably um yeah my zen master and um i would also say
say my dog my first dog you know but then that's as a child right yeah and my zen master when i was in
my early 20s um just of his way of being and his knowledge of himself and um the way he was he was
unapologetic for who he was and he also taught me about compassion and detachment and how those two
could work hand in hand um and uh that detachment didn't mean disassociation um it meant actually
being very very present um but not um engaged in the story line right like open enough um to perceive
or have the awareness of more than just this piece that you're actually seeing so i think that um but i
learned um oh gosh i had um i think the the one that really uh is inspiring me now is uh my teacher
and mentor uh gary mills who is of the maker shamanic tradition which was originally a closed family
tradition probably starting around 400 a.d somewhere hanging out with the french huguenots in eastern
europe and then the families moved over and ended up actually in appalachian area and uh gary lives in
kentucky kentucky nowadays right and so uh he was literally last man standing in his family and said
well this whole shamanic tradition is gonna go if i die my kid doesn't want to do it usually went from
grandpa to you know to or grandpa or grandma to the grandkid it sort of skipped a generation i guess
throughout his family um and it was a closed family so he wasn't you know that family wasn't you know
get your free shaman classes here you know so he uh made the decision yeah i'm going to open this up
and not only am i going to open up this tradition i'm actually going to make it relevant to today's
people so yes there are a lot of um things that will you know that are older right like um but they
they don't hold with today's people today's contemporary people in the way that they think so
i'm going to take this box of skills and tools and and fashion it in a form that today's people can
relate to and um i think he's done really well and is has taught me so much um and and provided so much
context for me uh as well like um you know things that i just sort of knew or did at all there's a
this is a good reason why this would be like this or this could even help improve that aspect of it or
have you even considered do that's nice that's nice but have you ever done this you know that kind of
thing and i'm like oh my gosh yes let's do this and and also learning whole new things right and so
um my tradition now that i've been in for nearly nine years uh is the one that i feel um compliments
and enhances um what i who i am what i am what i've known um you know all of that and um what i hope to
be really so um that would that's my answer for that um please tell us the name of your zen teacher
um so i you know roshi right so yeah he was um a zen master out of mount baldy california and um he died
years ago um so i think i have his little book here hold on one one second yes by all means so
did i ever show you this book you spoke of this book so it's called the buddha is the center of gravity
it's the taste shows of uh uh joshua sazaki roshi at the lama foundation right and so there's this it's a
whole book of tesho and a tesho is essentially like um uh akin to a catholic homily or a time when
someone has a conversation and tells a story and then you're supposed to learn a lesson from it and
so when i met joshua he basically said don't read any books books are terrible you should learn only from
your own experience books are a waste of time and then i found this you know he this is his book
and i said how about this you know and he said oh you know sometimes it's good to read you know so like
do the same thing with like no one should uh or you should breathe in through your uh nose and out
through your mouth and in through your nose and out through your mouth and in through your nose and
out through your mouth and literally like the week later in through your mouth and out through your
nose you know completely stalking your position to make you more fluid now he would never use that
language but he knew enough about you know how humans are with our conditions of our patterns and
our behaviors our way of being our awareness and all of that and he was an expert stalker of um you
know finding those places where we become stagnant not fluid and and then twist it right to to bring us
back into a place of not knowing right because i think a place of not knowing is really where a place
of learning can happen or a place of true awareness can happen um and so that was you know that's that
was his shtick and in per se so did he not write a book on the gateless barrier so um you're probably
thinking of mumakans uh book and and that is the gate the gateless barrier is part of the mumakan which is
like a story um that someone may tell to provide uh like a like homily story i guess is when you know
so but he didn't write that no ah so i think you gave me a book so obviously um in my 20s i met john
tarrant roshi uh wild story i read the book musashi the historical fiction of the japanese swordsman
became interested in zen thought i was going to move to japan went to the bookstore where the
guy ordered the book for me his name is ishmael he's an older guy he's like hey how you like the
musashi i said oh i really like it but i think i think i might sell my stuff and move to japan and
study zen he said oh you could do that you know or you could come back in like 20 minutes and we'll go
meet my zen wait wait what really he's like yeah like a real roshi he's like yeah a block away you
know just come here coffee and so like okay i know that's a typical kind of story about me too i get
wild effusive dreams and then dream up you know crazy schemes to try to accomplish them and then it
turns out that somehow the thing ends up happening you know the same thing happened to me when i read
castaneda for example i was like i'm gonna go to south america and find one of these old toltec
shaman guys maybe even find this guy and embark on the path you know yeah not realizing that
i had already embarked on the path by having this intention and that wild trips to south america might
end up you know problematical to put it mildly so um you gave me a book which i love it's um
um aiken roshi is john tarrant roshi's teacher and um he was a man who learned zen in japan during
world war ii interred in a in a prisoner of war camp and he wrote a book called the gateless barrier on
the moon right and the moon con is essentially a collection of what zen people call koans yep yep
um these are really peculiar things because it would be common to think of them a little bit
like riddles but they're not really riddles it seems to me and i've never resolved the koan in my
30 some odd years of sentences haven't got there yeah but still sits on the point anyway but yeah
no i mean um you know again it's like that question of what is the source of light in dreaming this is
perhaps my koan right yeah yeah it's not that you want an answer um you one i think desires to have
an experience of insight and insight often involves detachment from narratives because the humans in
general we're very wrapped up in these narratives and i was making a little recursive story there
saying like i got really wrapped up in the narrative of i'm gonna become a zen student and move to just
right or you know i'm gonna go find damon right um this brings up the uh complex relationship between
the maker shamans and the castanadian traditions which had very broad and complex penetration into world
culture whoever castaneda was whether he was actually someone who was a practitioner or not is
not entirely clear to me after many years of studying his work and knowing other people who
walk that path in various ways but the power of his narrative is profound and penetrates deeply
um this book has changed many lives uh not always for the better i'm sure but there is a complex
and interesting relationship between the practices that the maker shamans uh teach and and practice and
i'm sure i'm sure there are layers of those right there's probably the public layer the slightly more
private layer the very private layer and then this is only for the and sort of deeply initiated folks
i'm guessing there's a kind of yeah i mean things are sort of unleaved or unveiled over time you know and
part of that is in within the maker training it's done primarily to keep a person fairly together so
they don't lose their mind right like yes all of it um they wouldn't know how to integrate it into
their daily life and it could cause some big problems right yes even with practices like martial
arts something very similar is done right you don't teach advanced techniques first people will get hurt
right yeah it's not an ego thing it's not a special cause of this it's really more um a compassionate
act um more so than anything else i feel so i've asked you this question before but i'm just curious
why do you suppose there's such a seemingly unlikely link between ancient apparently right ancient
south american traditions involving nagualism and the makers yeah i i wish i had an answer for that
because i have not read a lot as i told you i've never read any of those downline books or anything yeah
so i don't have maybe the the context that you might have that bring to it to find these similarities
and so forth but i have heard this over and over from other people who are like oh that seems like
really close to what those toltics did that i read in this book and so you know i've i've asked um gary
about you know how come there's this um seemingly overlay you know kind of thing going on and is what
the are what the is brought inside those books is is that is that stuff true or is there truth in it or
whatever uh do you think he really was hanging out with a toltic shaman you know or whatever and he
said you know i think he did hang out with um a toltic shaman i think he did but i don't think he
really truly understand what was happening and he provided his own perspective of what he saw or felt
or experienced and it wasn't necessarily on so it was sort of like um somebody who was wearing the
wrong um lens prescription on the glasses where they could fairly get an idea but they weren't quite on
with necessarily how it really happened and never really could uh find the the truth of it because
one they weren't really i don't know like initiated or paid enough attention or practiced hard enough or
whatever it was that they just sort of missed it so i i don't have an answer other than how i see and you
may and many people whoever is watching this too can see how many traditions shamanic or otherwise um
are similar but use different words or different ideas to represent the same kind of thing i call it um
you know different hands on different parts of the same elephant right so someone grabs the tail
tail and they describe the tail as having this you know long thin scaly thing with a little fuzzy bottom
and the other one grabs the tusk and they're like oh mine is completely smooth you know they're speaking
of the same animal but their experiences are different and um but you know if they were both holding on to
the a leg maybe then their their language might be more similar it's still again that same elephant
um and so i think it might be you know the the toltics and that form of shamanic tradition from
you know from europe they're both different legs of the same elephant um there really is not like
um huge disparate completely opposite truths you know about a specific thing there is a generally one
singular truth and singular truth um and and your knowledge or depth of that true singular truth
may shift based on your culture your privilege you know how you were brought up what baggage and
beliefs you have you know all of those things your your education all of those things um but
the tr the the solid truth the un really sort of unspeakable truth is that there is one thing
essentially there and so it does not surprise me or concern me um and and if we looked more carefully
at like you know the religion of the the san in africa or we looked at you know another type of um
uh cultural um practice that there is the similarity it's just that we are so um blind to actually um
bringing that connection together right so yeah does that answer your question it does um and this is
similar obviously uh you've also studied with michael harner and harner is someone who claims and i
believe him that he spent many years with a variety of indigenous cultures around the world and then
tried to sort of distill and then maybe shape that distillation for a western audience um and then
teach appropriate yeah yes we could if we want to have a court case about it we could have that kind
of a court case i'm not sure that's the most beneficial direction for us to go in but yeah i think he
tried his very best to respect um and care for the cultures that he learned from you know he started
the foundation of shamanic studies which essentially um helped uh provide financial aid to
indigenous shamans throughout the world um who needed different you know literally you needed
a tooth fixed and couldn't afford it the foundation would send that shaman some money to
to help with that you know financial burden so he really did love the people that he worked with
um you know but he also was careful about sharing and not sharing um different parts of information
of the shamanic uh traditions and knowledge that he learned uh unless he knew specifically like if
those um cultures agreed to sharing that information or if the culture was already wiped out then he felt
that that that culture could then learn or be um provided with more um you know open information for the
rest of it it's a very touchy topic and i just want to i want to walk through a couple of things briefly
um first thing is um some of the complexities that surround uh the current craze of wokeness
and perhaps political correctness are very bizarre in that again we have a situation where there's a
sort of a virtuous seed but the actual um cultural phenomenon that's riding on that seed
is highly litigious otherizing um and very complex um it's clear that cultures appropriate aspects of
other cultures naturally over time and this isn't necessarily the kind of thing that we want to
punish every time it happens but there are instances in which that appropriation is egregious
and deserves careful attention um but you also have the problem like my friend ryan was saying
um an elder came to a classroom where some blackfoot language and tradition was being taught and he
said he took the teacher aside later and said something like you know you can't teach these things
in school this is this is wrong what are you doing this is our traditional knowledge this shouldn't be
and the teacher said do you see those students walking around the halls out there it's like yeah
ask them what my toy is the wolf path right because not one of them knows our language is dining our
people are disappearing right our culture is going away so you want to fight over whether or not it's
in the classroom or we just don't don't preserve our traditions at all you know and i think the guy kind
of saw the you know the light so to speak about this and this is this is common because colonizing the
colonizing aspects of human culture which are terrifying and tragic are incredibly fierce and
profuse and successful so they just win right there's no there's no way around it they just win
so in some cases um the only way to preserve the knowledge is to um
acquire the permission to transmit it from the people from whom it comes and this is a common
part of many traditions right there's a formal transfer of an ability a skill a tradition and
usually part of that transfer is that the person who is transferred to is trusted with it
and they're trusted to be intelligent about how they share or teach them i want to say a few things
about normalism very briefly sure um
um so there are a variety of practices that surround what castinated was teaching one of these is
recapitulation which is essentially getting rid of your life story right mostly like getting rid of the
connections and the of the energy between the different individuals that are involved in the life
stories so you'll still remember the life story uh you just won't have the energetic connections um or the
like emotions that you originally had and so kind of charging yeah detarging it and um taking back your
energy that was involved in in those stories and giving back the energy that you may have taken uh in
in in that process there's another feature which is the um transparent sizing of the self image so that
i don't just identify with my life story i realize there's another being there in me my dreaming self maybe
um and um freeing this one up from the traps of the narratives and the other things and again this
is just me paraphrasing um there are gazing practices particularly with an obsidian mirror
on the belly or a bowl of water on the belly there are statues of ancient people who have this bowl of
water on the belly okay it turns out actually means something like the navel of the moon okay the gazing
downward and this is part of getting rid of the um the waking world persona so that you can become
other forms in your dreaming right you can become animals and things like this okay um and these are
just things i've recently heard and remember from reading castaneda another simple feature was that
while we're awake the nagwal sort of in the belly tonal in the head when we sleep these flip over
and a practitioner of dreaming learns to accomplish this while they're awake right okay so it all goes down
in the belly and the nagwal becomes uh aware while we're awake and capable of interacting with our
waking minds certainly when we were children we had the capability of a special kind of dreaming that we
call play but that was very compelling and seems to imply that our dreaming mind was with us while we
were awake right because we could immediately switch into play and the real world was still there yeah we
were having this completely other experience we're told you grow out of that that's
bullshit you don't grow out of that right you can forget it and then re-remember it well it's also the
the um incredible impediment of representational cognition picking up language words mechanical relationships
with objects that's not a toy is the thing children hear a million times a day and children are like
wait the toy isn't a specific thing it's a way of relating with a thing right so how could it be
formally not a toy yet the adults will tell them you know that's not a toy so those are some things i
just wanted to cover for the people who had no uh previous exposure to to them um there's something i
want to get to and this is sort of the big gem for me in a way of our conversation if you're willing to
share about this i once asked you if you'd had any experience of fairies oh boy are you willing to share this
story because it's one of the ones that lives in my heart i i will and uh you know we'll find out what
sanitarium i'll be in next week you're too worried about that that's never gonna happen no i mean you
know it is what it is so uh you you're probably want you're probably interested about the fairy story
on my land up north right okay um so first of all i will say that uh we use this word fairies um in a
sort of bizarre way in in america um maybe or i'll just say in our culture um we tend to think of
fairies as being little tinkerbells that come around and you know grant you wishes or whatever they're
gonna do or cause trouble or whatever um but fairies to me when i speak that language it basically mean
that they're somewhat familiar um and interactive with humans um and they tend to move into up into
what i'll call this world right so we can you and i maybe uh can see them without really any kind of
like special sensing or anything like that there are some things that sort of sit just slightly off
this world time space and you have to sort of shift your focus your awareness in order to see those
things whereas fairies are something that you know you could be walking through the woods and go oh what
is that strange thing that i can't quite discern and maybe that might be called a fairy so a fairy can
some people may um uh confuse fairies with say they saw an alien or they just saw a weird creature
or this thing that flew and sort of looked like a bird or whatever it is but um for me uh i use that
term sort of very generally um and it it means that i'm interacting with things that um in our normal
reality we don't have words for really but they're energies that are self-directed have intent um and
will and can do things and interact with humans so that i'll just preface all that so okay all right so
um i have about a hundred acres of forest and fields and water uh up uh in northern wisconsin
and that land borders the national forest so it's very wild um out that way and um i try to
cultivate um a relationship with that land um it is very wild full of teeth and claws and um you know
it i respect it deeply but i also want to um have a a friendly relationship with it and so one of the
things that i did uh when the oak trees were having um a fungus uh invasive fungus called oak wilt come
at them and it was literally killing killing trees i went around um with my sister and uh provided
medicine to all the oak trees in the area and then i would mark the tree that you know what year i did it
and because i think you can do it like every other year or so and you would literally drill holes um at
a certain height around the tree into the cambrian so you could insert the medicine so it would be
absorbed with these huge spring-loaded syringes to push the medicine in and that should supposedly help
and some of the uh trees it did help and some it didn't but i had um decided i was with my mentor
who can see very well and who has since passed but someone that i respected deeply and uh was very
familiar with fairies in the folklore sense so they were able to say oh that's a selkie or that's a
this and that's a that you know and have names for them and stories behind them and and so forth whereas
i'd be like that orange light you know so um so he was with me one night and i had made a bunch of
offerings to what the um the entities at the at what i call the crossroads which is literally it's a
crossroads of trails and there's a um a bunch a stand of trees and i i made some i don't know
probably alcohol and tobacco and honey and candy and um you know the superstition is fairies like to
have shiny things and sweet things right so if you leave that for them then they're supposedly happy and
my intent at that time was just to say listen i am uh you know trying to do what i can to help the land
and i sure could use some support from you guys if you're up for it so just let you know i'm here
my intent is good um to help these oak trees and anything else you guys need let me know
in you know and i'll i'll do the best i can and so i didn't really think much of it it's something
you know i've i make offerings and have those kinds of conversations on an ongoing basis
um and so my mentor and i were we spent the day out in the woods and and putzing around and stuff and
then um he's like you know we should stay up late tonight and see if we can see some fairies and i was
like oh all right that sounds fine but you know i'm an early to bed kind of person so this was a
fine you're a guest we will do this kind of thing right and so get out there and have all the lights
off in the house um my sister is asleep and there it's completely dark other than the moon and the
stars and there wasn't much moon as i recall excuse me and so um if i recall the first thing that i saw
were orange and red lights that were around an oak tree um about 50 feet or so uh in to our slight
left and so um i asked him i said hey do you see those lights he's like yeah i see that and then all
of a sudden the tree instead of just these individual lights circling the tree um it became that the
whole top of the tree glowed in a bright orange color and the branches were dark so it looked like
a reverse x-ray of the tree um and you know the whole thing lit up and i was like okay that i
haven't seen before that was pretty cool and um my mentor was like nope i haven't seen that either and
then the um the color the colored lights of that orange moved into the trees further back in the forest
there was like a bit of a grass opening and then it went into the forest it went all through the top
of the trees and just spread out and i was like oh that is cool and then it um also would move around
right like so there would be like a whole bunch of this um sort of orange thing that would move around
and then it flipped on over into the other forest which was all pines so there's a bit of a driveway
and then rows of planted pines that were planted about 45 50 years ago by my aunt and uncle and that
the whole layer up there started glowing in that beautiful orange color and then all of a sudden i
noticed that there were it looked like as if and this is gonna i cannot this could sound insane but it's
like as if somebody was holding one of those giant movie theater lights that go up in the sky you know
what i'm talking about they come and freeze usually right and they go oh this is cool the matinee lights
or i don't know whatever they are so if someone had one of those giant lights and they were just sort of
winding and weaving their way through the woods of the pines you know going around the pines like weaving
through the pines so you would see these lights sort of like moving like this through there and i was
like very very bright and i thought oh that's very unusual and then all of a sudden the light spilled out
onto the driveway in the grass and so this light sort of like came out and instead of being a white light
it formed um like a straight lined rainbow which was really neat so it was like you know the red and the
orange yellow green blue and purple and it just like whoop it went out and i thought oh
that is super cool i was like yay i love it you know and and i was just it was very fun for me
personally because i could verify in real time with another person who could see that this was actually
happening and our only question was is this something that everybody can see or is it just something that
people who can see can see you know what i mean like um but it looks so much like it was in this
layer stuff in other layers tend to have like a bit of um like a vibrational haze to them i guess is the
best way to explain it so you can sort of tell at night it's hard though because um things are it just
is harder like driving down the road and you're like real not real real not real you know like uh is
it in this layer not like this layer this layer not this layer that's why i say real not real is
sort of my shorthand for should i worry about it it's real should i not worry about it it's not real
right right so it was kind of like wow this is so bright and so um vibrant and moving that it it would
it had to have been in this when i say this layer i mean like you could see it you know like everyone can
see it it's a shared experience uh and then um the these lights also and this so that would happen
for a while and then all of a sudden i'd noticed something over here was going on and there was a
tree that um was across from the house that was a pine tree that was actually split into sort of like a
a sting so it was one um main trunk and then the trunk split into like a u right and and part of that was um
broken or um mangled or something like it was not well it was a sick tree and so um when i looked
there were these like probably i don't know if i can show this in here is about this wide about this you know like
this circle this diameter it looked like a super bright flashlight of about that size that was
like squiggling back and forth on the tree up and down up and down where the wound of the tree was
and at that point i was like okay somebody is seriously with me so i'm going to go and and i looked
behind because it you know maybe somebody in the house was like doing a flashlight because it was just
so bright uh no the house was dark and i'm like oh so that light was happening but is very interesting
during because the light didn't look like it came from anywhere i assumed that it came from back there
but there was not like um like a light beam that happened right so it was just the light was on it and
and so i just want to point that out as maybe you can chew on that for a while when it comes to your
dreaming stuff so but so that happened for a while and then there were the light there were a series of
red and blue and orange lights now i am familiar very familiar with those lights there and they're
very common um uh in rural areas i feel at least my experience like farmers when i grew up knew about
those lights and they would swirl around the tractor as they're working at night and things like that
i've heard stories about that happening so those lights have never bothered me like i just call them
fairies right like oh that's the fairies whatever and they they never do anything they're just sort of
like they can't to me it seems like they kind of like machinery so they were buzzing around my back of
my car but i noticed as i was looking at they lit up the um they were so bright you could see the license
plate number on the on the car and that that i noticed i was like oh they are kind of bright you
know but just another kind of like put it in your pocket and save it for later kind of thought
but then there were um there was and this happens with um what people call ghosts uh ghosts come in
different flavors from my experience they can be an actual sort of put together entity um that that has
or seems to have a kind of intent um or it can sort of be like a residual kind of uh energy that sort of
repeats itself over and over and over so you know like um the ghost that you see that walks the hallway
but never leaves that hallway that to me or you know comes out the wall and walks over there and then
disappears into the wall and it does it every night at 11 o'clock or whatever people say i call that
residuals it's not really necessarily a ghost it's just the energy of that person sort of still hanging out
and doing its thing because that's what the energy does so um so fairies sort of have a little bit
of weirdness to them in that way where there was something that um god the description of it is just
going to be ridiculous now that i thought you don't have to do that you just say just say what you say
please so it looked like essentially it was about maybe three feet long and sort of like a caterpillar
with a lot of little feet and then it had a cat face to it and it would walk across um an area and
then make a right turn toward me and my mentor and then make another right turn away just like like
inches away from us and then you know move off and then it would come back and do the same thing so
i don't i couldn't tell if it was like the same being or just multiple beings but they also followed
the same pattern or whatever it was but it would all they would all move just like that on those right
angles and and come right up and then at one point there was one that came right up to my face and it was
like oh holy you know and it had um a very grotesque kind of cat like face but almost i don't know what
to explain how to explain it really but it was pretty freaky and my mentor was like um yeah don't be
scared don't show fear and i was like okay
at the same time like oh i haven't seen that you know
so my sister can see and she um i told you know we told her about what happened the night before and
she's like oh i want to see him you know and so the next night um she and i went out there at about
the same time by that time my mentor was gone and she and i came and the one came right up to her face
too so there's still you know i don't think it's like a anything to worry about i don't feel threatened
by it there's not like an um an omen and it's pretty clear that what i gained from that experience
that night before with when that flashlight was that kind of you know those two zigzag lights that
were going on that broken tree that was a really clear indication to me that the spirits of the
land were saying hey you know just like you're doing your part in this world to take care of
those oak wilts we're doing our part too and we're just showing you that we're doing our part to help
with um caretaking the land as well and so it was like a reciprocation of um our communication that's
all that's all really what i gained from that whole time in that i felt privileged enough to see
how they in their own way were um you know providing care for that area of land that all those other
entities and that they brought me in to let me see that to to you know like see we're all in this
together essentially is what i gathered from it now that's my human perspective on that experience but
my heart felt like i would not have seen such an extensive i mean this was several hours long of
uh i would not have had that experience had i not done the work that i've done formed the communication
and the outreach and and been compassionate um uh you know about my experience for what i was doing with
the land so yeah that's my story i love that story it just seems um both deeply beautiful and profound
and also like truly magical yeah i've never heard a tale like that in my life yeah and something of
the spirit of the event i think comes through you know when you tell the story um nothing that none of
those things you're concerned about those aren't even relevant this is life experience you're there with
the teacher a mentor your sister in the wilderness and i think um the sort of the child in me thinks
something really beautiful about this like she saw the nocturnal procession of the fairies like they
were you know they were dancing and doing their their celebration and it just seems incredibly
found a beautiful thing um and i'm so grateful that you're willing to share that oh thank you um i
would like i hope that we can uh maybe do another interview again sometime very soon because there's
so much more i would like to learn from you and hear from you but for those people who are trying to
learn to grow their capacities for dreaming and seeing what would you recommend for anyone who's like
still pretty inexperienced or maybe has tried a couple of things and not really found something
that they trust yet any advice that you would have would be really useful yeah so i do a monthly
shamanic drum and journey circle in my community it's a free event that where i teach people how to do
what you're suggesting or what you're asking about and one of the pieces of advice that i offer is use a
sonic driver like a drum a drum works pretty good to help bring us out of basically your your mind
right like your thinking mind and um if it's running at a rate um if you go on the on the
internets and they say you know shamanic drumming it's usually at a rate about um 180 to 220 beats per
minute which then flips your brain waves to a theta state which allows for more of this closer axis of
a dreaming state while you're awake so it's very helpful for relaxing people and putting them in
the place of where they can be to get to that place of um that uh journey right or active dreaming space
so one of the biggest pieces of advice that i offer the people that come to the circle is pretend you're
five years old again right be open and curious and playful forget about whether or not you're doing
it right forget about how you look forget how weird this all is and just explore and be playful and
creative and and curious with no expectation of what it is and to just go for it right and to have this
experience allow yourself the privilege of just being innate right just going back to that time where
you can you you didn't know anything and you just experienced for the love of experience right just to
learn and if you can bring yourself to that place and and i i would suggest if you don't remember how to
do that go get a picture of yourself when you were five years old four years old three years old take a
look at that kid in that picture and and pull up those memories and that'll help shape you to shift you
into that kind of position that you need to be in for that work and then have an intent uh so and it
doesn't matter what your intent is just as long as you have one um something like i would like to explore
this you know other world where i want to visit with my great grandmother who passed away or i would
like to meet with this being in their own way i want to meet with the whole ancestral trees of the oaks
right i want to whatever it is i it doesn't even matter and then allow yourself to go and do that and
don't get hung up on whether or not you're doing it right or if you're making it up
um many people adults are like well i'm just making it up i don't really know how to do this
and i you know i could have thought of that you do this a few times and i promise you something is
going to happen where you are going to say to yourself i would never have had the idea to think
of that or to come up with that information or whatever it is they will surprise themselves because
then they've got that link so when they get that link the next time that they go for it they'll have
a better time at it right so like if they meet up with i don't know some owl or an oak tree or they
want to see the underground river beneath their house whatever it is they can get to that place
easier because they've already made the first energetic connection and the second energetic
energetic connection to that place and that'll make it easier for them but i always suggest have an
intention and when you get lost or kind of confused or you're feeling dumb or whatever it is go back to
your intention repeat that to yourself and and try it again and not to give up immediately you know
adults we're always trying so hard and we're hard on ourselves right so i can't do it i don't have
the ability yes you do have the ability i can tell you every person that i've worked with it may not have
happened the first time but i can get them there and they can get themselves well they're getting
themselves there with my guidance right they're doing all of the work they're finding the information
that they want to get they're meeting the beings they want to meet they're doing the work that they
need to do they're doing their own self-healing whatever it is um they can do it and and i believe
it's inherent it's inherited um into every human um that they have this power to do this so hold on to that
that possibility like we were talking about before that oh if i know i can do it or if someone else
can do it i know i can do it right like there's a path to it please know there really is a path and
it's accessible to every person regardless of whether or not you grew up in a spiritualist or
you know uh whatever kind of culture that you have everyone you know originally everyone their lineage
goes back far enough everyone had that connection and can reconnect i truly believe that i with all
my heart i believe that every person can reconnect to everything again you know to not only other humans
and the whole humanity thing but also to the elements and to the um the insects and the plants and the
and the birds and the mountains all of it um it is possible and beyond that you know to ancestors and
and other worlds and things like that we really can do this um so that that's my suggestion that's
brilliant that's brilliant yes i think um uh we have the idea of like a human library but we don't
realize there's a living library and we're not just surrounded with it we belong to it we're made of
it right and so there's all of this um momentum just waiting for us to open the window you know open
the door walk a few steps toward it and that the library will meet us according to our heartfelt intentions
and our our authenticity right it will come to us and it's yeah nothing it's more than all the fantasy
stories that like alice in wonderland it's kind of boring compared to what's actually alive in the
world even though alice is a great trope yeah i also want to make a mention and please for anyone who does
you know kind of journey work or whatever and if they have an experience don't go looking it up in
a dream book for what it means don't go looking it up on google for what does a yellow butterfly
mean don't don't be doing any of that stuff that that means nothing it will not relate to your
personal experience you are unique in the way that um you have your own connections you have your own
beliefs and patterns and behaviors and and relationships and so forth so how you feel
that connection or that thing brings to you that is yours and and don't let anyone take it or persuade
you that it means something else please don't ever do that that's a it's imperative that that um be known
for every person that does this kind of work there is also a really important distinction between the
public and the private that you've just highlighted right some experiences um
the waking mind is the pretty much the wrong thing to hand off a dream to right it's going
to dissect the dream in a surgical kind of conceptual way and the dream is its own innate universe
it's you know yes there are um there are skillful methods of interpretation of dreams and so on
but our non-ordinary experience is sort of it withers under the harsh light of examination analysis and
explanation and it flourishes in the living light of wonder and awe and adoration and curiosity
so there's something like to point that you know every shamanic practitioner who's worth their salt
will have a completely different lexicon for their knowledge than um the next competent shaman so what um a
black cross means for for one shaman it is something else for another one and so every shamanic practitioner
who does real serious work has their own personal language and lexicon symbols and things like that
that does not necessarily translate to anyone else so um it also relates to people who aren't in a deep
shamanic tradition that please just hold and learn your own lexicon um because that is um it's imperative
that you trust yourself and and how you relate to this world everyone relates to this world differently
everyone can have the exact same experience and then speak of it in you know their own completely unique way
and they're all right right so they're all using different words but they're all right so keep
your own words is what i'm saying beautiful yes if um someone would like to learn more
about um you or your practices or the makers is there a good way that you're comfortable with
yes yeah i'm fine i mean the the maker shamanic tradition is not closed anymore it's open for
business basically like you can learn about it if you want to you're going to spend a hell of a long time
learning and you know we you know if you get involved in uh learning the tradition literally you know the
first one and a half two years is self-healing so there's a lot of work involved in it and then it
goes from there because um the gary mills who is you know the primary teacher of that tradition um for
what is open um is doesn't you know wants healthy people doing healthy work for to make other people
healthy essentially and so that doesn't happen unless you do you clean your own closet first
so um the website that people can check out is called shamanscave.com and that's it it's not the
sandra ingerman podcast it is its own school so shamanscave.com and it talks a lot and there's a lot of
information i think there's um i don't even know how many articles there's so many articles but
speaks about not only the maker tradition but things that you can do for yourself to uh for your own
starting your own self-healing and starting with like a basic uh recap uh exercise to um what um what's
the difference between reiki and shamanic healing to you know like there's all kinds of questions
uh there's stories there's basic information and um fun stuff in there you know that uh you can access
for free and then if any of that intrigues you then you can sign up and it's live classes that are taught
there is exercise there are exercises that you are expected to practice and report back on like this
is real world stuff there's verification there is you know um communication it's um primarily it has
always been an oral tradition right so there's nothing really written down it was just people who
taught each other and then um for gary for instance he was taught since he was a very small child until i
think he was like 16 or 17 and then he basically learned to fly with the knowledge that he got from
his grandfather at that point so um this tradition is complete and made um in a fashion now for people
um of today you know like this tradition is stems from thousands of years ago but that stuff doesn't
translate well into today's world and so how can we make it actually applicable for people in today's
world and that's what you have now with the maker uh they call it the contemporary shamanic tradition
it make it'll make a lot of people mad because it doesn't use um spirit guides and fancy flying animals or
anything like that it's all really um your own power and energy and learning to accept the responsibility
of your own power and energy and cleaning your energy so it can be useful and so you can move energy so
it's it's very very uh intense and good you know like if you're truly interested in um you know doing energetic
work in the world you mentioned that you run a drum circle and where is that that's in my hometown of
uh milwaukee it's once a month and um you know people come from any shamanic tradition or no shamanic tradition
whatsoever you know people who are just interested in what i you know my my motto is discovering and trusting
your inner wisdom basically so just coming in and trying something new maybe they heard about
something they have um an actual specific problem that they need to resolve then they i give them the
tools on how to do that and it's in a community-based format so and it's while i'm the circle keeper i am not
not necessarily the the leader right the whole group acts as the leader and um is very supportive of each
other and it's a collaborative effort um and it's a place where people can be vulnerable and share
and respected and that they trust that what happens in the circle stays in the circle so people can do some
really good hard difficult work actually talk about it you know and um you know feel like they are doing
some good self-healing how would someone uh connect with that circle yeah so i have a website for it it's
said um let's see it's drum journey circle uh dot square space dot com i never ended up getting my own
domain because i never thought that this whole drum circle thing would fly and here i am eight or nine
years later i'm still doing it so maybe maybe i'll get rid of the that square space i'm happy to help you
out with any of that it's useful thanks um do you do you practice for others what does that mean or what
what does that mean if someone needed help with something could they reach out now i do now i do um
i have always been of the mindset that um i my intent or my focus was always other than human
focused so i did a lot of environmental work i did a lot of death walking death doula type of work so
they're not living humans but um my mentor um feels he wants me to do more real in-person um you know
personal human uh healings i have been doing um and i have and i have um a fair actually where a couple
other makers are coming into milwaukee and we're going to be doing healing of for like seven hours
on a saturday or something and just bam bam bam bringing in people so uh doing some healings that'll
be fun and then um i will start doing more one-on-ones with people uh in the next while and
till a few thousand people and we'll see how that goes and then
but i've been doing i've been working with the because in my tradition you're not allowed to even
think about healing other people until you're about six years in of of study and then after that time
then you can sort of um uh learn you know sort of like um internship i guess with other uh makers in
their uh healing lab which is like a a distance or online healing lab kind of product so there's like
eight to ten other shamanic practitioners makers who are working with to heal the same person at the
same time so as a group collectively they get together they discuss the client they go see
what they're seeing at the client and then make a plan on what needs to be uh healed and how to do it so
um yeah so i've been doing that for a couple few years and um now doing more in-person kind of
feelings as well and how would someone reach out to you about that if they were so inclined
i'd say they could just contact uh info at drums or drum journey circle.com i'm going to be working
on something more formal because i also have a death doula component component and um i've trained
uh have my death doula certification and am a member of inelda and things like that and i do
do some death doula work right now i'm i've got a client who is not actively dying so i'm not working
as closely but when he's more actively dying then i'll be working closer with them for instance and
then um working in hospices and then i'm part of the no veteran dies alone program with the va that i work
at so um i'm not necessarily um doing uh energetic work unless it's requested or asked for i'm not
pushing my services on anyone unless they energetically or you know speak that they want
that kind of work because not everybody wants it you know and frankly if you are working shamanically
with people some people don't like to have their energy muttzed with by other people or they don't
like to have the idea known to them that you know when i'm looking at a person energetically i'm also
seeing their history i'm seeing their different layers i'm i see their seminal events i see where
their trauma sits i see you know things that they don't even see for themselves or want to speak about
and would be mortified if they thought that i had an inkling of it so that kind of work is a little
you know got to be careful with it you got to be tactful with it too so um you know just because you
can see it doesn't mean you need to talk about it necessarily because the person might not be able to
accept it or doesn't know about it or can't integrate it well but you can still work with it
i understand that's beautiful yeah
any thoughts before we wrap up for this evening no thanks for your time tonight i had fun talking
about this it went on longer than i expected but um i'm all right no i mean i've got another
