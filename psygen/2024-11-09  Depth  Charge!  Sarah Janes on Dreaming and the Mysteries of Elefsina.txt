hey Sarah wonderful to see you hello Darren how are you I'm pretty well and I'm super excited
to be here today with you I'm so curious about your work and your history and I'm fascinated
by everything you do um so I'd be grateful if you could just take a moment and tell people
who are not yet familiar with you a little bit about yourself and your work and what fascinates
you okay so uh I live part-time in Greece and part-time in England and I wrote a book two
years ago about the history and culture of dreaming in the ancient world with particular emphasis on
Mesopotamia Egypt and Greece and now I'm running dream themed retreats in Greece and other areas
where there are ancient temples dedicated to sacred sleep or divine dreaming so that's what I'm up to
these days and I guess I got into this whole area because I've just always loved dreaming and been
a lucid dreamer since I was a kid and it's been a huge passion of mine and then over the years
um I've realized that my kind of love of ancient history and culture could be married to my love
of dreaming so I've discovered this kind of niche weird path for myself uh and I'm loving every moment
of it beautiful yes I am um particularly inclined to pay attention to people who are operating on the
outskirts of uh what we would think of as ordinary uh humanity and ideas and concepts and stuff um
and your work is particularly fascinating to me due to my own long um astonishment about the nature of
dreaming and some of my early experiences I wonder if you might be willing to share a few episodes from
your childhood dreaming that were particularly influential for you that you may remember
well one of the things I was thinking about today actually was um I had an opportunity a couple of
years ago to in interview this amazing woman called Rebecca Sharrock who is one of I think only about 80
people in the world who have been diagnosed and assessed for this um not really a condition but a state
of having highly superior autobiographical memory so she's also on the autism spectrum but she has this
phenomenal memory where she thinks she can remember before she was even born and she has memories of
being a baby of being a toddler and uh when I discovered I was going to interview her because I was
interviewing her with my friend Anthony Peake who I have co-hosted his Consciousness Hour YouTube series
with for a while um I was really excited to ask her about lucidity and dreams because I figured if she
has highly superior autobiographical memory then it must mean that her dreams are lucid because dreaming and
memory basically if you have a great memory then I think you're more likely to become lucid and one of
the things I would always advise for people seeking more lucid episodes is to do what they can to improve
their memory um there's a relationship also there with like language and being detail orientated so
it fits in really well with autism spectrum as well and so many other aspects of sort of hypersensitivity
synesthesia she's synesthetic as well so I was just super fascinated by this and it turns out that she is
lucid in all of her dreams and one of the questions I wanted to ask her was because I have these memories
of dreams when I was a baby perhaps or um a toddler that were all white and I said you did you have
dreams that were all white in the beginning and she says she remembers having dreams that were all white
for a while and like me um were populated in the first instance by like a single favorite toy
in my case it was a Fisher-Price pull-along phone and uh and I remember this dream distinctly
of my Fisher-Price uh phone you know the little one that's got a face that you pull it along it's
called like a chat along or something like that I picked up the receiver and it was my nan telling
me that um no it was Wurzel Gummidge telling me that he'd killed my nan do you have Wurzel Gummidge in
America so Wurzel Gummidge is a terrifying scarecrow tv show that I I know the actual episode that that
dream was inspired by because I can remember being terrified of Wurzel Gummidge when I was small
um and I found out when it aired and so I would have been about four then when I had this dream
and uh I answered the phone and Wurzel Gummidge was like a really scary like um wrinkly faced
horrifying scarecrow that could take his head off and chuck it at people and uh there was this
particular episode that really scared me where he was chucking his head off of the back of a van and
throwing it at people and I think that's what inspired the dream so I remember that very distinctly
I remember um a dream that had my first experience of ecstasy when I would have been about um I get I
was at primary school and I dreamt that I was a cat sitting on a rocking chair and I guess I'd had
lucid dreams before then but this dream was lucid and I had this like bodily sensation of ecstasy like
this euphoric feeling which I've come to since really associate with the lucid state so in this
dream I was just it was a very simple dream I was a black cat sitting on a rocking chair but I could
feel this like delight in being in a cat's body and the texture of the pads on my paws and like my fur
and teeth and claws and everything and it was just an amazing sensation and so I very much distinctly
remember that dream and then one of the sort of main features of my dreaming especially when I was
a child was there was this particular landscape this dream landscape that I used to return to every
single night and there I used to draw maps and it's one of the techniques that I use for dreaming is
like this dream cartography dream mapping where you draw out um the landscape of your dreams and the
architectural structures and the features of the dream landscape to kind of create feedback between
the waking world your creative output and what you're dreaming about and it works really really
well especially with children because I do dream workshops with children as well and they're a brilliant
at it so I do exercises with them where they'll do something like design a fantasy dream theme park and
in the act of doing that the process of doing that um they're actively imagining exploring this dream
theme park designing the rides getting excited which I think is an important part of like the emotions
associated with um experience and really fantastic things so they get excited doing it they imagine
themselves doing it they tell me stories about what it's like being there and then that I get them to
dream it that night and then they report back and tell me like what it was like exploring that dream
theme park so my one my dreams uh landscape that I can still remember now it had things like uh an
underground pier a red velvet underground because I was into the velvet underground when I was a kid
and uh uh it had a sinking sand beach with a cable car ride over the top of it um there was a huge kind of
um uh school building with lots of small windows that had a uh jungle next to it and a farm where
they bred flatfish like just all these little things I used to like drawing and and create maps of and I
was always really into those books that have um fantasy maps in like uh you know cartography and it
like Tolkien's Lord of the Rings and Alice in Wonderland and all that kind of stuff
brilliant oh I'm curious if you can recall an early experience
in which something profoundly strange occurred that you didn't understand
uh lots of things my dream life and the kinds of experiences that I had in my dream life
I think um directed me towards exploring philosophy esotericism um considering perception as being
malleable reality as being malleable considering that there was something that happened to your soul
upon death that your soul goes on journeys during dreams so um as a kid I was a bit obsessed with a
creating some sort of machine that could record my dreams so I could show them to other people
people and be um that if I perfected lucidity was able to absolutely do it and be in complete
control all the time that I would um survive dying and I could explore these other realms that I would
visit in dreams and I was sure that um where you go when you die is the same place you come from when
you're born and a place that you can access in dreams as well that's why ancient culture is so like
great for um exploring dreaming because you can kind of look at it in a very academic scholarly way
looking at the material culture but through dreaming it's a very legitimate way of doing something really
creative with the imagination as well so I love it because I like being scholarly and academic and
really nerdy and going to lectures about ancient near eastern material culture and all that kind of
stuff but I also like thinking about what what I might imagine the dream life of someone in that time
could be like that brings up so many questions okay so once again I want to ask you about any early
experiences or a um central experience in which something occurred that you were completely unprepared
for and didn't understand anything like that in your recollections that so I had a dream once um
that you know I told you about there was a school building with lots of small windows and I remember
walking past and as I say like I was always reading about esotericism like it got me into thinking
about the nature of the universe and the cosmos and all this kind of stuff and I walked past this
school building one time where there was a you were walking into a jungle like up a dirt track and this
is where the the shed that had flatfish uh where they were breeding flatfish and then there was a tunnel in
the flatfish hut that you could access the red velvet underground through and as I walked past the school
building once um there was an equation written like in chalk on the side of the building and when I
looked at it I understood the secret the meaning of the universe and I had this kind of mind-blowing
epiphany type of experience and when I woke up I tried to write out this equation and like since then
I've come to the realization that your dreams will kind of provide you with what you think might be
required to understand something because now I don't think there is any meaning or secret of the
universe but at the time that's something I was questing for and it seemed to me like logical as
a child that that could be something that was contained in an equation so even though I saw this
writing on the wall this what I considered to be an equation on the wall it was probably nonsense
but it it acted on my consciousness in such a way that facilitated this like mind-blowing
transformation and I had a lot of other dreams and one of the things I'm really interested in because
of this is dreams where I'm given a drug or a substance in a dream and that drug or substance
changes my consciousness in the dream so I have like a psychedelic experience or I can I get drunk or
it just it acts as an agent of transformation within the dream which is something that really
interests me with regard to myths around this idea of eating food in the underworld or taking food from
another realm and the fact that you have to stay there if you if you do that wow okay so that brings
up something yeah there's there's so many things here those are beautiful recollections um I'm this is
such a treasure oh my gosh uh okay so what about experiences that happened for you either
hypnagogically or hypnopompically where you had an experience that wasn't really dreaming but was very
surprising anything like that I've had a couple of really great hypnagogic experiences recently because
I'm looking into Greek mythology so much and especially exploring the gods goddess or figures of
uh importance in the Asclepian family and in the Asclepian tradition so two of those that I've been I
purposefully kind of incubate for dreams with and I have kind of hypnagogic meditations
focused on them have resulted in sort of interesting encounters so tell us for us I had recently which
is probably my favorite led me on this whole amazing quest to discover who tell us for us is and what
I loved about that so I had this um I had a hypnagogic experience as I was falling asleep I'm very
interested in tell us for us he is this kind of child god sometimes represented as a dwarf sometimes
represented as the child or son of Asclepius and he you know we're told he represents the completion his
his kind of the personification of the completion of the cure and the successful treatment of a
patient entering the holistic healing sanctuary of Asclepius and he's mostly um associated with the
site of Pergamon the Asclepion of Pergamon in Anatolia so as I was falling asleep tell us for us came to me
in an image and told me that if I needed if I wanted to know him then I had to really know his name and that
was it it was just a very direct succinct message and so I started to look into his name and think
about him a lot and um meditate on it and uh look at all the statues I could find of him and all the
records I could find of him anything in stories that I could find and one of the other things that came
through in that as well is that I might find him in uh folklore or fairy tales as much as I might find
him in mythology and he is supposed to be a Celtic supposed to be a figure from Celtic mythology that's
the idea um but then the next day I received an email from someone saying I've just seen this little
tell us for us in a French museum completely out of the blue and they sent me an image of uh the
tell us for us that they saw and that was like validating so I got even more into it and I wrote an
article about how um one of the other things it wasn't part of the hypnagogic experience but
something that came to me is you know like sometimes just information just sort of comes out
of nowhere it doesn't seem to relate to anything you're thinking about the time you might not even
know exactly what it's referring to but one of the things was that I thought tell us for us was born
with a call um and I don't know I can't remember now where that even came from but the more I looked
into it the more I thought um that that would make a lot of sense especially in terms of him
uh developing and evolving out of this Celtic uh almost geni type figure because uh there's this
concept of the luck child this uh lucky child that's born with a call and is protected from harm
throughout their life and tell us for us acts as someone who protects someone throughout their life
he protects them in birth um he brings them into the world he's often associated with um women in
labour and facilitating an easy journey from uh the mother into the world and then often he is found as
a votive in the graves of children um and shows them holding their hand and taking them into death and
and being their guide in death so there was just something intuitive about he might relate to
this idea of the luck child who's born with a call and and as that figure could be like a lucky charm
like a lucky totem type of figure so I just got really into researching that and I I it's a there's
a lot of stuff that I found out about tell us for us and about um actually being born with a call
being like a huge thing in the ancient world across all sorts of cultures that if you're born with
some of the amniotic sack on you um that this means you're going to be lucky throughout life
and in ancient Greece they even practice a sort of divination looking at the condition of the call
on the body and especially if it was um a kind of band around the child's head that that showed that
they were already crowned and so there's this association with being born with a call um marrying into
royalty because you've already got a crown um either having great beauty um but one of the
main things is being protected from drowning so Perseus the hero Telephos the hero who is actually
why I think Telus Foros is named Telus Foros because um the first mention of his name is found in an
inscription at Pergamon and Telephos the king who's like a mythical hero king is the legendary founder
of Pergamon so I think they there's some association because Telus Foros seems to sort of suddenly be
named Telus Foros and appear as Telus Foros in Pergamon for the first time so um so yeah I went down
like a lot of rabbit holes with Telus Foros but uh I felt that that was a a special important thing
to study and one other thing about the Asclepion at Pergamon is um the main treatment center where
you went after you had kind of undergone all the other stages of healing so the catharsis in the
theater the purging the purification in the cold water baths when those stages of the healing had
been completed you walked through a tunnel and at the end of that tunnel is a treatment center a
circular two-story treatment center that was actually called the Telus Forion so it's the temple
of Telus Foros and that's where you were perfected so one thing that's um come through to me recently
and something I've been working a lot with hypnagogic um incubation and sort of intentional dreaming
is that darkness was a massively important part of healing and what we call initiation but that wasn't
really initiation in the ancient world in terms of the rights of a Elefcina this idea that you are
perfected in darkness and that darkness itself is um a kind of ritual practice to reveal the divine
presences of gods and goddesses so I've recently started working with Maria Marigou in in Greece
and uh she's she sort of specializes in deep etymological analysis of ancient Greek words and
is incredibly passionate about it and has spent years researching the Elefcinian mysteries and you
know her description and her explanation for what was happening in the Telus um Telestereon the
the initiation hall is that um the Telestereon the word Telestereon the the root of that um means
something like the perfect the place where the perfecting rights were carried out and uh one of
the things that Maria says that I find really interesting is that 30,000 people would take part
in that sacred way pilgrimage um 3,000 people were allowed to pass into the sanctuary and could take that
place in the Telestereon um but only a handful of those in the Telestereon would actually have the
experience so it isn't like the Freemasons you you're not going through grades and receiving
qualifications and getting any seals of approval um it isn't like a hierarchy like that it's you either
are perfected you either have the divine experience and the direct experience of the gods and goddesses
or you don't and um that's something that I think is very interesting so something you know one of the
other things she says about the Telestereon is that um some of the initiates some of the misty that
enter the Telestereon report spontaneous healing events so the darkness and the perfecting rights
themselves like what's occurring in the Telestereon uh Pergamon uh when a patient is perfected
in darkness by the gods is that you are kind of perhaps leave your body um encounter something
divine and come back in and your con your consciousness your spirit is recalibrated
so that you can be healed from things and I guess I think of that because I like to think about these
things on a sort of practical scientific level how is this possible that someone could be healed
from something like um an out-of-body experience and I think about something like um it's not uh
what what used to be called disassociative identity disorder I think it's got a different name now um
but where someone experiences a trauma or a shock and in order to cope with that an aspect of their
personality kind of splinters off and they create this other personality so in some of those um
some of those cases you can have say someone's got three personalities one personality's got an allergy
for example and if they're having an allergic response they can call in the other personality
or the other personality can be uh coaxed out and that allergic response will stop so it is really you
know something that I think is a much more sort of complex and fascinating avenue to explore but I think that
one of the things I'm very passionate about is uh like ancient Greece ancient Egypt ancient Mesopotamia
is we unfortunately have kind of forgotten about the existence of the soul and the soul needs to come
back to medicine in order for holistic um healing treatments to take place like we are more than the sum of
our parts and the ancient Greeks absolutely acknowledged that we have a soul and that soul
can be healed and perfected through non-physical experiences
so much there excuse me to digest um and so many thoughts um
um so a couple of things that occurred to me as I'm listening and trying to understand um
the incredibly rich intelligence that you're sharing here which is just such a treat oh gosh um so
it strikes me that the the journey that you're talking about during the Ellisonian
process we'll call it an initiation resembles uh a sort of a recapitulation
of conception um embryogenesis transit through the womb into the world as if this is being uh
intentionally almost as if that's the central figure or one way to see the central figure of existence
is this process and so by undergoing it occurs to me anyway that by undergoing this process again
it's like being reconceived and then facing the crisis that happens uh in the transit from
the womb through the birth canal you know to the exit of of into birth
and somehow uh for some reason the telestarium reminds me of what the child encounters in their
first moments of existence right they're surrounded by beings right and and these beings mediate the
experience of the transition from the existence in the womb to the existence in the body and and the
human world and things like this and so it it seems to me that the telestarium might be reminiscent of
those beings that mediate conception and embryogenesis and have a purview over the transition
from the womb to birth what are your thoughts yeah well i think that that is something maria
would um definitely resonate with and she talks about this idea of um insouling matter and that it
is this opportunity to die and be reborn consciously you know when we're first born into the world we
don't know what's going on if you have that second death it's less about the death part and more about
the rebirth but the death is necessary for you to experience the rebirth and you get something very
similar happening at the holistic healing sanctuaries of asclepius as well where hypnos the god of sleep is
seen as the brother of death thanatos so you you go for your sacred sleep in the enki materion and that
serves as a pseudo death from which you wake up and your your unhealthy sick self dies in the enki materion
and your healthy self is reborn to the world and so um people entering there is an initiator equality to
going to holistic healing sanctuary of asclepius and one thing that i think is really important to
consider with regards to the mysteries of lf cena as well is the mistai would begin this process of
self-change and self-improvement six months at least before so the mystagog starts teaching them the ways
to live a better life in the spring and that six-month process they're like trying to be better
and nicer and a good person every day and improving themselves so when you get finally to the telestereon
it's this huge climax it's a huge um moment of realization that you've been preparing for for six
months and i and for me it is it's an opportunity to be consciously born to be the person that you want
to be to be the better person with all of your faculties and everything that's gone before
it's an opportunity to get rid of everything that doesn't serve you um up until that point and embrace
a new life and it reminds me as well of um the oracle of trophonius where you have to drink first from
the waters of oblivion of lethe and then you drink the waters of memory so you know it seems weird that
you drink the waters of forgetting and oblivion but i think sometimes in order to grow and in order to
um upgrade to the better version of yourself you have to forget the stuff that's gone before
and embrace the the new remembering of what you're about to encounter so you drink the waters of lethe
and then you drink the waters of minimosini so you can remember what you're about to encounter but
with regards as well to um this idea of the womb and the genesis you know just the goddesses you
have um uh dionysus has an important role in the mysteries of elefcena in his role he's like a torch
bearing version of himself it's a special version of dionysus especially for the elefcenian mysteries
and persephone is is called uh corey at the elefcenian mystery so she's the maiden and you know the word
corey the etymological root of it comes from sprout so she's like the essence she is you know
we've me and maria even discussed perhaps the word core comes from corey and chorus yeah so um so
demetra is the earth mother and corey is this sprout this essence this first shoot of life and
the process of uh going on the sacred way of taking the kiki on of being in the telestereon of
that you know there's psychodrama that's enacted there's uh mourning and loss and drama um you become
one with the gods and the goddesses of the rights like you are them and so by by sharing i think there's
an aspect as well you know the the potential psychedelic um components of kiki on i'm i'm
still on the fence about i don't know whether or not there was any psychoactive substances in it i know
there's a case for um uh uh uh the um enzyme the uh what i forget what it's called now what's the
the main one that's considered ergo so there's a case for ergot being on on the barley that was used
to make the kiki on but i kind of think given the preparation and the anticipation that very little
extra is required for you to have uh hallucinations especially if you consider the telestereon is dark
and you've been fasting for a night and you're ecstatic and you're like highly prepared for something
incredible to happen and you believe that the gods and goddesses are going to actually uh manifest
in that space that's an enormous amount of anticipation which you know i don't know if you know
about this kind of darkness retreat therapy that's a big kind of trend now of people going on darkness
retreats where they are put in a space a completely black cave for example for three days and i think
it's like something within uh 50 hours you begin to hallucinate vividly hallucinate so it takes very
very little for human beings to start hallucinating so uh for the kiki on to be packed full of uh ergo is
kind of unnecessary but i also wouldn't rule it out and there were fields that were dedicated to
growing the barley that were used to produce the kiki on and all this kind of stuff but for me the
taking of the kiki on is more about uh kind of theogenia the idea of having this sacred meal with
the god this divine hospitality and uh you get the same thing in the asclepion holistic healing sanctuaries
as well where um a big part in epidavros in particular is about sharing this meal with the
god and that that in itself is a healing ritual because you are partaking of the same food and
you are becoming divine and through becoming divine you are um throwing off the the kind of
uh illnesses that can affect mortals so to me visiting the sanctuary of asclepius you get this
real sense because it's enclosed by sacred grove as well it's encircled by trees and the sacred grove
was protected in those in that area if you cut down a tree you could be um you could be killed like it was
a very serious offense to cut down a tree that belonged to the sacred grove of asclepius and that sacred
grove acts as a kind of buffer zone between the mortal world the ordinary world and the world of
the gods and goddesses and there is something it's a big it's a big um sanctuary the one at epidavros
and uh actually the footprint of it in terms of the archaeological site today is a bit smaller than
what it was originally because there are other temples on the outside of the uh archaeological enclosure
but the the set the place really feels like it was a a place where the gods lived and i think there's
also something for me that's really important of how beauty and nature can heal you and that if you
find yourself in a beautiful environment and you're surrounded by biodiversity that that just helps
encourage healthful life and a gear who is um asclepius's daughter you know she's often called
the personification of health but really her name means um whole she's wholeness you know she is like
perfect harmony and wholeness and wholeness is health and so this uh very important
way of considering healing as being wholeness is something that i think we would do so well to return
to these days um especially with regards to considering beauty and nature and um treatment for the soul
wow okay i have a million things in my mind um let me walk through a few of them
um when you were first describing by the way maria's work is absolutely fascinating i hope to do an
interview with her sometime very soon i'm so grateful to you for introducing me to her work
um she is absolutely brilliant i've listened to the the recording that you shared with me over and over
and over again and every time it's one of those things where every time i listen to it
it's as if i'm i'm being it's like i'm being transformed inside right i'm get i see totally
differently each new time which kind of reminds me of the process of having a day of waking life
falling asleep dreaming and then awakening again right there's so much here that's fascinating um because
one of the things now that may be different for the woman that you were describing in the early part
of the interview i can't recall her name yet um it may be different for her and perhaps say again
please highly superior autobiographical memory yes yes yeah um rebecca charrick charrick
so for her it may be different i'm not sure but one of the things that i find very profound and i'm i've
been long fascinated by dreaming and i've you know i've made discoveries of my own that i think are unusual
but um
are waking okay so the concept of left head right being dipped in the waters of forgetting and then
being dipped in the waters of i i pronounce her name nemosini but i think you called her
how do you pronounce it um i put well i mean i've i've not that bothered about pronunciation
as as long as well i like saying minimal sceney minimal scene when i first um wrote the book i thought
it's nemosine nemosine yeah but i say nemosini now i mean i guess because i'm in greece people are saying
things back to me and i'm trying to remember how they're saying it of course do you do you recall how
um maria says it i think she says nemosini okay so
first of all we can imagine a very simple metaphor which i think is trivial
just the metaphor of a chalkboard right we write on it we write on it and then it goes back to black
and now we can write anew um and you know i've been fascinated by the concept of lethe and of course
this is the root of the word in english lethal right to mean deadly um so when i awaken in the morning it
is as if a vast array of memories of darren his history what has harmed him what has given him joy
what he regrets all these things right this is a vast weight to carry yeah and most of that stuff
disappears when i go to sleep right it doesn't really accompany me it doesn't accompany me in my
dreaming in the way it accompanies me in my waking life let's put it that way and also when i wake up
there's there's this long linear continuum of darren right that i know and is familiar and i have the
things i have to do and the problems i've solved and so forth and all these things right like a vast
library of stuff whereas um when i begin to dream it's like a new world my dreaming
self does not recall yesterday's dream right though it can it's not you know it's not a law it's a
principle right it can yesterday's dream can certainly influence what i dream tonight and so forth um
so there's something fascinating about uh being cleansed and also this purgation that you spoke of
i think is super important it's something i was reminded when you were talking about
the elsinia process and by the way maria pronounces it lf not l use lf right lf signian or perhaps you could
uh correct my is i say a leftist and elefcinian a leftist and elefcinian okay great so when when
you were describing the process you went through like four or five phases and one of them was
purgation right and then you talked about how there were 30 000 people a certain number of them would
be chosen to actually undergo the process the ones that got to the telestereum maybe some small number
of them would actually undergo the healing experience and i think what do you think about the idea
that this could be the birth of the concept of democracy right that some are chosen and we have
we're supposed to undergo purgation before we go out voting and so forth right yeah it is probably wise
that uh people that make decisions about the world have gone through that process i mean one of the things
i was sure i did a podcast this morning actually one of the things i was talking about was uh peter
kingsley's research into dream incubation i don't know if you've read uh wisdom of the dark places is
a book he wrote about the history of dream incubation in ancient greece and the fact that um empedicles and
palmenides were uh almost the kind of the last of a long line of what we might now call kind of shamanic
sages that we associate with eastern practices but there was a tradition in um italy and greece in uh
the um polis uh around the greek world of a kind of wisdom system and tradition that unfortunately was
lost and that um he talks about dream incubation being something um where people that were leading
communities and the heads of these polis or these elected members would purposefully dream to make
decisions to write the laws of the police and that's me makes so much sense you get a group of people that
dream they try to connect they receive the laws in their dreams you still have to check um because
you've got these other people that you're responsible to something about the veracity and
show discernment in terms of interpreting those dreams and not making you know crazed decisions
based upon perhaps unhinged epiphanies or whatever and i think veracity and uh discernment is really
important when thinking about dreams um even in the same way that you might with regards to psychedelic
episodes as well because i know there's been a lot written about um uh some issues are surrounding
uh psychedelics and how they although they're supposed to kind of dissolve the ego often result in
jesus complexes in people where they don't show discernment in terms of integrating those epiphanies
and they think that they are you know accessing the secrets of the universe like i told you about
my dream when i was a kid you know so discernment and veracity testing are really important with dreams
as well but uh i think that because dreams enable you to make really fantastic novel associations with
enormous amounts of data and to have this overview effect that actually good decisions often result
from spontaneously divinely inspired dreams that um that do often result in good uh
good solutions to problems like they one of the one of research about lucid dreaming is that if you're
a regular lucid dreamer you're good at problem solving it's like a kind of uh something that lucid
dreamers have been recognized at good problem solving uh which i find quite interesting because novel
association and having the overview effect i think they can often make quite good mediators because they
can dream of another person's perspective i'm so reminded of our um overwrought uh valuing or authorization of
thinking right and it strikes me that i mean i've recently been struck by the insight that
thinking is one of the worst things you can do with the mind we think this is what minds are for
this is not what minds are for minds are for something like dreaming communion insight forging the
third mind together and moving together into this place from which our purview is radically expanded
and and uh there's just so much like i i was saying i think thinking you know for a mind thinking
resembles what it would be like for a bird to be nailed to a rock it's a symptom of isolation
and of course you know i'm hyperbolizing and i'm italian right we do this naturally i'm being very
hyperbolic but i think we've got entirely the wrong idea about what minds are and what they're for
and it's because we're paying too much attention to the pseudo left hemispheric you know grasping
manipulation um objectification utility pragmatism accounting courtroom games right all of these
things which if you happen you know our pattern recognition is supposed to be used and applied for
survival and uh this is why i think social media uh drives people insane because of course you can
see patterns in it because it's all patterns and algorithms and so this is why we are living in these
like increasingly small echo chambers and halls of mirrors and arguing with ourselves and ai is going
to drive everyone even more insane because they're talking to themselves and and people can't help but
have opinions on things and there's almost like a pathological need to express that opinion when the
opportunities become available and the more forms of communication we have the less we're actually
communing communing is more important than communicating so i think um in our common daily lives and those of
us who are not particularly well versed in the wisdom of dreaming um we place far too great an emphasis on
thinking and i honestly believe that there's a place for thinking right i don't want to just throw it out the
window but in an actual communal situation the amount of thinking we would do is much more it's vastly
minimized and i think thinking is a symptom of isolation from the polis from communal um awareness concern
reputation problem solving questing play creativity all these things and um you know i don't i don't
want to just go on about my perspective here but there's a couple more things i want to say hey now
with ai the humans are going to invent a mechanical god what could go wrong i mean that's going to go
great every massive upsurge in technological development for the humans has almost been the
the opposite of something like um the development of awareness communality presence authenticity
uh resurrection rejuvenation all of these things right um and i i don't think the humans realize that
our technologies are cygenic they produce mind states the same in a not dissimilar way that drugs do
right and i don't know if you've looked much at images produced by ai but those i played around
quite quite a bit because i've been i'm fascinated by the problems of technology and so have been for
many many years i'm a technician and my early experiments with having chat gpt produce images
were literally mind-blowing i mean they were psychedelic experiences um that were more like psychosis and
insanity than they were like oh let's produce beautiful images um so i'm fascinated by all of
that but i want to stay on topic here and there's a couple of things i mean that's something really
interesting as well and i'm really interested in how material culture influences um uh perception of
reality and structures of reality so you look at the early creation myths and they tend to rely upon
the material culture of the time and the technology of the time so you have people being created on a
potter's wheel for example or you know the earliest ones are people coming from the stars
and now we talk about uh simulation theory and that we're all living in a computer game
and um you know ai will become the next uh creation myth that we are created well people already say that
don't they that we're created by like a highly technology orientated civilization and we're
minions for it or whatever but um one of the things i research in my book i'm very interested
in um i'm super interested in ancient material culture and how that can help you kind of reverse
engineer the likely feelings about reality because so say for example one of the things i'm really
interested in is the history of mirrors and the earliest mirrors ever discovered to my knowledge
are have been found at chattel hoyak in anatolia and they're polished obsidian surfaces like palm-sized
hand-held mirrors and they became elite grave goods around this time as well they're also really early
obsidian mirrors found in china and places like this and um and then later on in egypt mirrors became
associated with rebirth with life with the sun with uh hathor and with ra and um uh when glass and
mirrored surfaces were invented one of the kings of france developed this condition called the glass delusion
so i think you're completely right material culture does reflect back to us our sort of psyche and
vice versa and we are augmented and changed by our habits and cultures and um the glass delusion means
that you believe you're fragile and that you could shatter because there's this kind of over associating
with the material world i guess and i think that's why so many kids kind of go crazy when all they have
is um the internet and they don't have physical one-on-one interactions with people very often they
don't have to even acknowledge their physicality they can exist in a completely cerebral virtual way
and therefore they're disconnected from their body and they feel uncomfortable in their body as you would
if you are sitting down all the time and looking at a screen it's the obsidian mirror this is an obsidian
mirror and so is the computer and so is the television right we've and we keep this in our
hand at all times and it lights up i mean we should think very carefully about the metaphor what this is
replacing right because part of what this is replacing is something resembling a guardian spirit
or intelligence that connects you to the sky right and it's always as well it's a portal to another world
and instead of the world of our imagination or of our collective psyche it's an other world generated by companies
and by other people so it's um you know i i think of these modern devices and the modern technology as
being kind of outsourcing our memory so instead of sending the tendrils of our memory out um we are being
kind of severed from that that connection and that memory i mean one of the things i think in terms of acts of
in terms of acts of worship and in terms of what dreaming teaches me more than anything is that the
point of a human being is to create biodiversity on earth and and and celebrating life because life is
creating energy and working magic and um so you know one of the things i really love about being in greece
is there's an archaic nymphae on on my road and the little wild tortoises gather around there and
butterflies and for me it's like well the nymphs are still alive because the wild tortoises are nymphs
and the butterflies and nymphs and the birds and nymphs so i can feed the nymphs and honor the nymphs
still and i think that you know i've got friends that work with nature connection and psychedelics and
they talk about nature appreciation and uh one of my friends sam gandy talks about uh shifting baseline
syndrome where as modern humans we can't really appreciate how much biodiversity has um changed
in you know the last few generations because you know uh passenger pigeons used to blacken the skies
over america and are now extinct you know i think the like the amount of life the density of life and i
think the density of life is is more about more than just about living organisms it's about spirit
nature spirits and the more um we look after and cultivate and culture life and biodiversity the more
nature spirits we're creating and the the denser and thicker and more connected that web of life can
become and we will feel more part of it the more nature that's around us the more we can feel like we're
we're dreaming with the planet i mean i would argue that the humans are profoundly confused in asserting
their separation um conceptually or their supremacy over nature uh more it seems much more to me that
our capacity for memory and intelligence floats on an ocean of biodiversity and as we burn that down
we get dumber and what the problem with getting dumber that way is the first thing you lose is the
capacity to tell that you're getting dumber right like if you're being if you're being deprived of
the faculties that you need to understand that you're being deprived of something it quickly just
becomes a cascade and you can certainly we want to imagine that to exist in the ancient world surrounded
by largely unaffected just oceans of biodiversity right memory and dreaming were probably a completely
a wildly more astonishing experience than what we moderns will usually experience not that it's
entirely unavailable to us but i think what i'm trying to get at is the humans seem to think ah you
can just kill up a bunch of stuff over there and you still got your house and your car and your
shotgun and your whiskey you know we're gonna be fine it's not true like this is one our planet is one
being and that being also has relationships and friends and as the humans i mean for the earth
the interval over which the humans have been decimating the environment is very tiny right it's like
one eye blink or something but if she wakes up and gets upset about this and her friends get upset
about this things are not going to go well for us let's be really clear these beings are not we are
nothing compared to these beings like we are little dust specks floating around on the surface so i think
our health vitality intelligence memory capacity for um transcendence or awareness or learning all of these
these things absolutely depend on biodiversity and we've just been burning that stuff down and converting
it into dead objects and machines and artificial intelligences and so forth i mean the idea that the
universe is a simulation is hilarious um the idea that the brain is a computer or that the the that the mind
is just the brain doing stuff there's no chance of those things being true yet they can be mechanically compelling
um i want to be careful about not doing too much doom singing on the other hand i want to sing the
praises of the living planet that i adore that we both you know live for the sake and in the womb
moment to moment of you can imagine an embryo that just starts attacking you know the uterine wall with
machines right like what what do you expect what's the outcome there i mean is who what do you get out of
that so i understand i always think like the most the most kind of great thing you could ever do in
life is be a gardener you know because i i've had like a little garden uh and i've got a little garden
now in greece actually and i i love having a little garden and when you grow things um you see all these
relationships and you love the plants and i think you know a big issue with people feeling lonely these
days is they're not able to extend their love or their feelings for anything beyond
human interpersonal relationships but you can love the land and you can love plants and you
can love animals and you you wouldn't have to feel lonely if you can develop those feelings for
something that's non-human yes and um uh yeah i i just found like gardening is one of the most healing
things we can ever do and and human beings i mean i don't know how things are there but in england
you know people are living in increasingly small places on their own no human contact let alone
nature contact and it's very easy to feel disconnected from the throbbing pulse of life and one thing that
helps you to release a fear of death is feeling that you're part of this fabric of the cyclical nature
of life death and rebirth and regeneration so i think you know this is something that the people in
the who took part in the lfc in mysteries must have felt in in a very real embodied sense and i've
been to the site of alephsis during springtime you know and i and also i've been to a theatrical
performance like a um at the great theater at pedavros as well which is a theater that was part of the
healing treatment so you'd go to the theater to be engaged in raptured to experience emotional
catharsis like that is why you went to theater because it was healing it was like a healing right
and um with the diminished um stripped back chorus and scenery which at the time you can imagine would
have been like incredible with like 50 people in the chorus um extravagant sets and costumes and designs
and like raucous possessed musicians i can't even imagine you know it must have been wild um and even
without that degree of like religious fervor you can get a sense of how healing it would have been
to have had that cathartic experience in an ancient greek theater you know with especially with the
natural acoustics so i mean that's another thing that i'm really interested in is the appreciation that
the ancients had for sound design um and the theaters are the theater epidavros is one of the best in the
world it's like acoustically perfectly designed and um there's another structure in the sanctuary called
the themeli which i think is uh an architectural divine instrument that people would enter into to
become one with the the performance with the chorus so that structure is called the themeli and the
most common use of the word themeli in ancient greece is for the altar stone that was at the center
of ancient greek theaters um that was dedicated to dionysus because all ancient greek theaters double as
a temple of dionysus as a shrine to dionysus and it's where the conductor of the chorus would have stood
to conduct the chorus so the fact that this whole structure is called a themeli and is quite unusual
in that sense uh suggests to me where a performance took place that was considered to be cathartic and
uh pafsanius the greek uh travel writer he he was present when it was kind of um uh still standing or
part of it was still standing and there were two paintings inside one was of eros putting down his
uh bows and arrows and picking up the lyre and the other one was of the personification of drunkenness
like a drinking wine and so the dionysian overtones to that and dionysus is a figure of healing and he
gets forgotten about um you know his role there but to to have the catharsis that religious ecstasy that
a frenzy is a way of releasing and purging um negative feelings or um uh frustrations or anxieties
it's just an opportunity to release blockages emotional and physical or mental
okay so many so many amazing things in my mind again from everything you've shared um
but i'm gonna circle back to a couple questions that i had earlier in our conversation
i know i'm blessed by knowing a number of ex unusually insightful and intelligent women
um and one of the first uh of these women that i met is a woman named katherine ironwood i think it's like
y-r-o-n-e-w-o-o-o-d and she used to be one of the publishers of eclipse comics she lives in forestville
now and is something of a a hierophant priestess um and she told me a story in which she would dream
about a sort of a village or a town and she began to draw maps of the town and eventually she met a
man there and they would go to the cafe when they met and they would sit down and they would have
coffee and they would talk and they would talk about the fact that they're both aware that they're
dreaming and that they know that they're dreaming the same place over and over again together
and eventually she says and i trust her that they exchanged contact information and met in the waking
world have you ever had any experiences resembling something like this or heard of things like this
i have had experience i have heard of uh a couple that met in a dream and then the
they'd both seen each other in dreams and then eventually met one another at a conference and the
guy was looking in various places for this woman and i think he because she's greek and he's mexican
and because she doesn't look typically greek um he was looking in some wrong places but then
they eventually uh came across one another i can't remember where they were in the world but they
were at the same conference they are um they are uh holistic architects and they have a um company
called geophilia and they work with dan winters do you know dan winters yeah harim and uh yeah they're
they're very much into sacred geometry and things like this so yeah they were they were sharing dreams
before they met and passing messages to one another and i can't remember i can't remember now the details
but it's it's a big part of their story is that they saw each other first in dreams and then eventually
met up in real life um all right so there's a couple of things i want to touch on are you familiar with
the traditions from south america that are oriented around the concepts of the not wall and the tonal
and their relationship with dreaming i was talking to a friend uh the other day actually who's uh really
interested in mayan dreaming and uh has been doing lots of research into that but i don't know much
about that tradition since i've been a kid i've like found um you know anytime i find a book on dreaming i
read it but the something i'm very passionate about is you know i really feel my roots in the
sort of western esoteric tradition like going to some of the places in greece i feel like i'm from here
like i've been here before and um and i think it's really important to recognize that in england in europe
in america in canada we have these traditions these deep mystical and mythical traditions of our
culture and and one thing that i love because lots of americans and canadians come on the retreat
actually and sometimes it'll be the first time they've come to greece and it's this amazing feeling
of homecoming for them like this amazing wave of familiarity and love for this land like and they just
and greece has this amazing sense of home for everyone i think like it just the greeks have got
like making people feel at home down to an absolute fine art so i mean like it's like nowhere else i've
ever been they know how to make you feel at home i mean i moved there within a week and i had no doubts
whatsoever and everyone has been completely delightful and welcoming and lovely my home feels immediately like
my home everything feels perfect i just feel like um uh one thing also and one thing i was going to
say about biodiversity actually is something i'm very interested in is how you know we consider ourselves
to be uh separate entities or this this new um way of viewing the human organism as being like a separate
organism inside an environment whereas actually i think in ancient times there was a greater sense of
we are part of the fabric of the environment that we're in so if you take someone out of a shitty
environment an unhealthy environment and you put them in a healthy environment then they can be
healthier because they're influenced by that environment and you know i i see this a lot with
people that live in uh messy cluttered dirty houses they're hoarders they'll start to become ill they'll
start to have like um blockages or uh health issues or mobility issues because their environment is
getting cluttered and as that gets cluttered you know it's like feng shui you you start to mirror
the environment in your body and there are all those studies in terms of um addiction and how like rats
that live in an enriched environment just you know they easily give up whatever drug the scientists have
been pumping them along and uh so i think this is something that the ancients really understood
so this is why they recognized it was important if you wanted someone to heal to put them in a
beautiful place and it seems like absolute common sense and intuition that you would do that but i mean
the state of hospitals in most western countries in the world are crazy because there's no appreciation
whatsoever that um you need a beautiful environment with nice lighting with airflow with healthy
delicious food with gardens with beautiful things and friendly kind people um helping you you know
i mean people do their best in these health institutions but they're they aren't considered unless
they have an extraordinarily visionary rich wealthy sponsor that recognizes the importance of the
environment but the environment is really important as well and i think we
we we are extensions of our environment and we should be very careful about uh if we want a place to be
healing of beautifying it and making it a healthful place yes so this brings up um problems in cognition
and concept which is one of my specialties actually um specializations so we tend to think either that we're
separate or we're part of something and i don't mean to criticize the language you were using it seems to me
more that um i'm not sure there's an outside of us right yeah we think that things outside of us are
outside but yeah i think we are instances of the universe the solar system this world the place we live
the home we live in the living places the entire history of life on earth um and also whatever the humans
in their mad insanity are doing to and around us so yeah i absolutely agree with you about hospitals
it's the worst the worst thing that could happen to you is to have to be in a hospital it's it's the
least healing environment you could possibly imagine if anything it resembles something like purgatory
or a prison it's just absolutely awful i was there briefly just overnight um one time a couple
years ago and i was just like you know what if i have to do this again i'm not i'm not doing this
again right like i'll just whatever you know i'll expire if necessary but i feel like that i haven't
got a doctor and uh the thought of going to a doctor's or a hospital is really horrifying to me and uh
yeah i mean i think i'll just lie down and die in an orange
i love you're so beautiful um okay so back to the south americans uh because this leads to a thread i
want to explore um i studied the work of carlos casaneda there's a discipline in in that branch of
bizarre probably mostly fictional mythos uh there's a there's a branch of their disciplines called that
they call dreaming they don't necessarily mean what happens to you when you go to sleep um and
some time ago perhaps four years ago now i was scrolling around on youtube i came across an
interview between this guy alan steinfeld who was the interviewer he's now something of a friend of mine
in fact i met him shortly after watching this video through a friend and i was listening to a guy who i
think his name is sergio magone or magone and he is a um you know like a like a toltec uh uh teacher
hey wow what am i oh i see i just um i just accidentally did a gesture that my camera understands
anyway so i'm watching this video about sergio and he's talking about uh dreaming exercises and experiences
and he he he he gives a couple of instructions um thankfully i tidied up my room a little bit before
so now that you can see the whole thing it's not just a mess um
so the thing that i want to talk about briefly is that one of the practices that these uh sorcerers or
magicians undergo is a series of practices with mirrors and specifically obsidian mirrors and more
specifically a a bowl of obsidian in which there is water placed and this is placed on the stomach
and you can actually see aztec uh carvings of these naguals which is a is a very complex word but
in the simple translation would be shape changer right these beings who can change shape they can
become animals or they can become a place or they can they can transform and um the practice is to gaze
into the mirror and cause your reflection to disappear right and he was saying that um
um if you find yourself in lucidity one of the most powerful things you can do is to to swap your
perspective from the one that you're used to in which i am in me and i'm looking out into the world
to i am the world looking into me and he says that what you will discover if you manage to do this
is that there's nothing there and that moment of discovery will liberate you now you have abilities
that you would not normally have even in a lucid dream so i found all this interesting i i was familiar
with some of the traditions um and a few nights later i found myself oh he also said you know if you
try to do that and you don't succeed if you try to turn your perspective around you don't succeed
then just look at your hands right which is a well-known um what something we're often instructed
to do in dreaming if we want to become lucid so a few nights later unexpectedly i found myself on the
roof of my flat while i was dreaming and i remembered what he said and i was very surprised that any of
this was going on it was night and i tried to turn my perspective around and it failed and i looked at
my hand and it was weird in fact what i remember is that the thumb was on the inside of both of my hands
right and they were and they had like extra fingers and more blurry and weird the moment i did that
something very strange happened so ordinarily in my dreams i'm still kind of myself right but what
happened this time was i i simply started flying and i don't mean flying like superman or or darren flying
through the air i mean um i became flying the action right and i went to a strange place weird
things happen i won't describe here i went to another place where i committed myself to the
eternal protection of two elderly women who were there um and this happened twice basically the same
kind of thing over a period of a few weeks four or five weeks after that i was on a call with my friend
and the guy who did the interview joined the call and i was like you're you seem familiar to me oh are
you that guy that interviewed sergio mcgoni he's like oh yeah yeah and i was like that's really weird
now what i'm trying the reason that i introduced these things there's two threads here one is mirrors
and particularly obsidian mirrors but the other is
in the castanadian traditions that are sometimes referred to as toltec which i think is probably
wrong or confused um there's a lot of discussion of what they call the other which or the double
what are your thoughts or feelings or knowledge about anything related to that now i i often think
before you you answer i often think that i try i'm trying to understand what took place in those
two specific experiences i've had lucid dreams before um and i've also flown in dreams but as
myself right like kind of like superman or something right um but this was a completely different
experience this was like i became an animal that flies i went and did a bunch of animal things and then
i went and to women in both both experiences the same sequence of events happened and i went to some
women in the first case elderly women and i and i was like i am your protector i will always be there
don't worry you know and in the second case it was a young woman at a deli and i was like i got your
back no matter no one's going to ever hurt you again which is confusing and interesting to me why you
know both these things happen but it seems that there's another aspect of ourselves and i want to
ask you a lot of questions about souls but it seems there's another aspect and this the other which is
a concept in castanaden and perhaps some south american traditions what do you know of this do you have
any experience of it what are your thoughts i did read those books when i was a kid i didn't realize
that's where this tall tech pardon when you were a kid yeah there's the castanader books i was really
into that sort of thing when i you know when i was at what age uh i don't know i've got like any books
i could find about dreaming i was reading like jg ballard books and stuff when i was 10 because he
had this book called uh the unlimited you were reading ballard when you were 10 no wonder you're so
well i i didn't like under really get it but i liked really surreal from a very young age me too
and um yeah i was probably a bit older than 10 when i read joji ballard but i basically used to go to
um there was a local library and i used to get any books that had like surreal covers and read them
and because jg ballard himself was a massive fan of surrealist art all of his early uh publications had
surreal art covers so i started off because the first book i read of his was the unlimited dream
company and i didn't know what it was about it just had a surreal art cover and i read it and i
loved it i just thought it was weird i loved weird stuff from a very young age um so i read everything
that joji ballard wrote um and um so i and castaneda the books that of his that i found in the library
they all had cool weird interesting covers and related to dreaming so i read those and um
one of the things that i find interesting about this idea of double or perspective
is something that brings up kind of ancient egyptian ideas about self and soul and uh dimensions and
qualities of the human being and how we're more than just the material body we also have this spirit
body the bar the car the act the shack the all the different aspects of the human body and um
one thing i like to consider as well my notes about these oh you've got a nice list right yeah yeah
so um saw the ran the bar the car the in the should the second the arc yeah i'm trying to remember one
one of the one of the really i mean i i tend to just think about the bar the car yak the shot the
ren is name so it's a bit of a different concept of self it's like yes remember remember with um
telesphoros he said you need to yeah right so you can there's something very important about name
right name is because you know i was thinking about like i think everyone kind of becomes their name
and uh it may not be in a way that you is immediately obvious but there's something
always like the name is the first spell it's like the spell that conjures you into the world
and you know my name being sarah when i was a kid in the in the 80s literally every other girl in
my class was called sarah so i was one of about nine sarahs and um we all called each other by our full
names because it was the easiest way to distinct that's why i call myself sarah james all the time
because my surname's james but it sounds like sarah jane and everyone called me sarah james at school
so um uh i've always thought sarah was really boring and i'm very un-princessy and the hebrew
name sarah means princess and that's not really like me but when i started studying uh hieroglyphs
ancient egyptian hieroglyphs sarah as a name would mean uh child of the sun and i'm born on june the
22nd so i'm a summer solstice baby and i i'm a complete sun adorer and i like waking up at dawn
and i love the sun so i feel utterly like a child of the sun and raw right yeah yeah it's a duck and a
solar disk is how i'd write my name and actually it usually means son of the sun but um the sarat
it would have to end in a turf to be the feminine sarat but uh really like the essence of my name is
like child of the sun which i love so i do think there's something about that like the even if it
isn't the obvious etymological root of the name there's still something like that you can find where
your your name makes sense for you so um one of the things i like considering looking at this
different aspects of the human being and egyptian conceptions of reality is that uh all of these
aspects pretty much dwell in the ib in the heart they don't they're not in the brain they're not behind
the eyes so this idea of where are you emanating from where is the center is the ib is the heart
which really transforms the way you navigate the world if you think you're emanating from the heart
area as opposed to behind the eyes which is generally i think conceptions these days tend to
be the brain and the eyes it's always fascinated me that um you know when i was running my lecture series
down here i had a lot of neuroscientists and uh people that researched in psychedelics from a
neuroscientific um perspective and they would do things like brain scans to work out what psychedelics
were doing and i was like that's really limited because you're a holistic organism system and there
are there's like um serotonin receptors in the heart in the gut uh there are brain cells in the heart like
like integrated so to just scan the brain and think from that you can really know what's going on
is weird to start with so i work with a neuroscientist um who's you know had some
experience with psychedelics and he would say wait a minute you're taking still still photos of states of
the brain are you taking still photos of the flow of a river where's the flow you don't see the flow
and yes the oldest i mean the brain has been around for one seven of the history of organisms
on this planet right so if you take that and divide it into seven you know for this many there
were no brains and the primary organ of knowing was the gut and if if anyone's ever done psychedelics
they're going to notice that the primary the beginning of the changes happen down there
right they don't happen here you feel your gut undergoing some kind of trans or at least i have
perhaps it's not the same for everyone undergoing some kind of transformation right and then that
leads to cognitive and sensorial transformations which i think you know the the neuroscientists were
expecting to find oh yeah this leads me back to a bunch of other topics we're expecting to find
hyperactivation and what they found was inhibition right yeah they found like stuff that normally
keeps stuff clamped down to reduce feedback across systems loosens up right and that feedback is
probably what we're experiencing as psychedelia i want to circle back um so first of all do you fly in
dreams have you have flying dreams yeah and actually you talking about flying is interesting so um there
was something that i wanted to say just quickly on the egyptian thing actually is that the egyptian word
the ancient egyptian word for brain is skull awful uh it translates to something like skull awful so they
did know that the brain was important especially in terms of like motor functions because there's reports
in some of the papyri about uh people having their brains exposed because of head accidents and
certain motor functions um not working or being like obviously related to particular brain injuries
so it wasn't like they thought the brain didn't do anything but it in terms of where they thought
intelligence and uh the soul was was the heart but um so with regards to dreaming yes i do dream in i
do fly in dreams had this really embarrassing experience once when i was watching a morning
breakfast show with my dad and uh russell grant who was the um the show astrologer and dream
interpreter was doing this kind of casual thing and interpreting people's dreams and uh someone phoned
up said oh i dreamt i was flying and russell grant me and my dad were both like yeah we've had that dream
and then russell grant said this is a sexual dream me and my dad were both like
so okay sorry no no this is super important um
so i was very surprised by what took place after i became flying in the specific way that happened after
you know i saw sergey magone i think that's his name because in both cases i went somewhere had a bunch
of sex and then went somewhere else and said i'll protect you forever right to these women
which i didn't understand at all it wasn't like i was i'm like what was going on here first i'm flying
then i remember i said i'm doing a bunch of animal things right so i'm doing these things right and i
was trying to you know keep it on the down low but there's there's a there's a variety of threads here
that i think are important to our conversation that i would like to draw into it um in in the best kind of
way possible and i understand why both especially if you're sitting there with your dad right and
like oh this is a sexual thing right you both just said like oh yeah i have things like this and then
you know you're looking at each other like wait you have sex um but uh
okay i'm trying to organize the threads so ecstasy right and it's you know the humans are us modern
humans i often do this i'll say like the humans as if i'm not one of them but it's because i'm not
merely human whatever we might be it's got to be so much more than just a human being and similarly
whatever our soul is it's not like a possession it's not like a thing in a jar right it's some kind
of wild amazing constellation of histories and brilliance and awareness and beauty and like the virtues and
all of these things right it's not we we tend to have in in america and we speak english we have
this sort of problem with one thing mind right a thing is one thing right that's a tree there's my
soul you know my soul is inside my body and if i die it goes outside my body you know and and whatever
and i think it's very confused because whatever a soul might be it's not daring right it's something
really astonishing and even if we take things without any metaphysics at all okay and we just
think of beings organisms organisms around this star here this organisms on this world animals humans
this human well most of me is everything right and then there's you know then we can sort of unopen
the matryoshka doll and take out each doll and we eventually get to that little tiny thing in the
middle called darren right so i think it's really important if we're going to think about something as
astonishingly unimaginable as what a soul might be we better be really creative right we better not
just be thinking like i got this thing you know and i also think like the you say again like casper
the friendly ghost hey yeah right i also think that like it's as if okay imagine a child who's like
flying a kite right and the kite goes up in the sky and the child's like it's almost as if part of the
child is in the sky it's very exciting when you're a child not necessarily when you're an adult
but i kind of think like the universe is is sort of fishing in material reality like myriads of
beings and forces and histories and such they form this little thread that comes down and gets
incarnated as darren and and you know it's like oh wow that's terrifying hang on a second
my camera's doing something stupid um anyway i'm going to try not to pay too much attention to it
um so there's there's so much going on here that is beautiful and astonishing um
i just got really distracted my camera's painting eyebrows on my faces can you see this
no i can't see it it's it's totally ridiculous um and it's just it's some high-tech nonsense that
accidentally got turned on let me see if i can turn it off really quick i'm not going to spend a lot of
time on this um so ecstasy dreaming orgasm lucidity i want to ask you a few questions that i often ask people
um
do you recall ever having seen the sun in a dream
the sun oh that's something i'm very interested in uh no and it's something i think about a lot
it's like um the things of the dream world are self-illuminated they're not illuminated from a
solar source or an outside source they like glow from within oh that's the best answer anyone's ever
given to that question which doesn't surprise me at all given who you are or what i know of you
um wow okay um have you ever seen the moon in a dream that you remember
i have stood on the moon and looked at the earth turning on its axis in a dream and so i have seen
the sun actually but uh from the perspective of the moon where the earth is turning on its axis
like it was different because it still had that uh that um that dark quality of light
wow but to ask you again have you seen the moon like you would see it from the earth
no okay what about stars yeah i've seen stars and uh nebula a lot actually oh wow um how about a lit
candle um can't think of a specific lit candle no a fire
yeah i've definitely seen fire and dream have you ever had a dream that takes place in the room that
you're sleeping in i've had uh an out of body experience that i was in a dream and i was in
the room that i was sleeping in yeah i had a lot of awakenings loads and loads of false awakenings as
a kid when because i had a a cabin bed that my dad made and i think he was drunk when he made it because
he didn't have a ladder or anything to stop me from falling out of it so i think part of the reason
that's how i got really good at lucid dreaming because i'd have to lie in it like this to make
sure i didn't accidentally kill myself in the middle of the night and uh another thing that
i think helped was um if i needed to go to the toilet in the middle of the night it was such an
ordeal to get out of my bed because i had to like lower myself carefully down stand on my desk
then get out and i was a bit scared to do it and didn't want to do it and i'd get cold doing it
so if i needed to go to the toilet i would just lucidly remind myself that i mustn't wet myself
in the dream because i was still in bed um so i think that helped strengthen my lucid dreaming
powers as a child
okay so when i mentioned having a dream in which you're in the room you're dreaming
you immediately said i've had an out-of-body experience talk about your first any what are
your first memories of an experience that is out of body like that there might be ones before but
it's the ones of uh being woken up to go to school or the vivid ones there may have been ones before
that but i can't remember those uh as well the the false awakening things were like out-of-body
experiences where one of my parents would come in and tell me that i had to get up and so i'd kind of
dream that i was up and i'd be up getting dressed for ages and then i'd realize oh no i'm actually
still asleep and i'd see myself still sleeping and then i'd have to start all over again and
sometimes that would happen like five or six times in a row um and so yeah they're the first ones i
remember and i really remember um having one one time where i saw a disembodied wolf's head standing
in my doorway okay that's really important so um as somebody who's paid a lot of attention to
dreaming i know some very strange things about dreaming that i'm i'm not sure that i'm the only
one that knows them but i rarely hear other i never hear other people discuss them so since i'm with
someone who knows about dreaming i want to ask you some things um the uh the head in the doorway or
the the bad black uh cloaked man with a big hat right um the homunculus that sits on the on the chest
and is uh one is suffocating um have you experienced sleep paralysis no i have had something the other
side of um i can't wake up out of the dream um and that's only really happened to me strongly twice
so i had one dream once where um it was a lucid dream where i was standing in the garden of like
a beautiful stately home i remember it was painted the color of duck eggs and i was on a gravel path
walking through the garden and i was just ecstatic and so i started to jump up and you know how you kind
of float when you jump up in dreams like the gravity is different so i was like just floating above
the earth but then suddenly everything went black and i was just plummeting into an abyss
and i tried to wake up because i was scared and i couldn't but i could feel the weight of my body on
the bed and it was like my soul was a was like a smoky spirit trying to click back into the right
position so i kept trying to twist back into the position to wake up and eventually did and was like
in a sort of panicked um and the other one i remember is an amazing like dream within a dream
within a dream where every tearing of the layer of the dream would result in just another layer
of dream and it took me ages to get out of it um and that's i've only had one experience that that
was like that but it was i'd wake up i'd think i was in the bed i think i was awake and i was not it
was i was a must have been in a really deep state of dreaming might have even been carbon monoxide
poisoning or something it was kind of uh i remember my friend did have a dodgy boiler and i did always have
really deep sleeps at that house and don't usually have problems waking up i i normally wake up quite
uh quickly and um so this was quite an unusual thing as possible there was some reason for me
having those but it was like layers and layers of dreams that just went on for ages you know
we're inclined to think that um and i think part of the problem here is the uh primacy of language
nouns and concepts in consciousness which is very deceptive we're inclined to think that um
if i say the word dream we always mean the same thing a dream is that's that thing we do when you
fall asleep right we think we know this but actually it seems obvious to me and i suspect you'll
agree with me here but there are a broad there's a broad continuum of forms of dreaming isn't there
yeah and so there are many different kinds of dreams and one of the things that distinguishes
a specific aspect or mode of dreaming for me is um having a dream in the room i'm sleeping in
i dream and you could call this we might use the language you know false awakening right because it
usually does involve something like that um i get up out of my bed uh i you know walk around the room
try to do something which leads me to another question i want to ask you have you ever attempted
to turn on a light source in a dream uh yeah i have because uh one of my best friends was really
into waking life and he didn't have very exciting dreams himself and when i would describe them when
i would describe describe my dreams to him it'd be like that's really weird i never dream about like
stories or places i just dream about shapes and there are hardly any colors in my dream so it was a really
weird thing that our dream lives were so different and when he watched waking life he saw other people
had lucid dreams and he learned you know about the light switch and i think the hand looking at the
hand is in that and looking at clocks and various things like that and oh one of the things so one of
the things he said to me she can't turn on a light switch in a dream or nothing happens or what you
expect to happen doesn't happen um and the other thing he said that you can't read in a dream so this
propelled me to do loads of dreams where i was turning on light switches all the time or turning
switches on and reading a lot of stuff and and so i had a run of dreams where i was writing down
words that were coming you know i was reading in dreams and looking them up online and um i like
reading in dreams but but text does seem to morph like does tend to morph or uh be nonsensical or the
form um communicate something to you that doesn't necessarily relate to the actual form of the word
it's like it it stands in as a sort of metaphor or a symbolic suggestion of writing wow okay there's so
much there um so what happens do you have memories of trying to turn on the light switch and what happened
um i think all kinds of stuff happened nothing happens uh things other than light switches
happening happens and lights go on so it could be anything and i think it's to do with uh expectation
context of the dream all sorts of stuff so usually what happens to me is and it's not the same every
time um i'll try to turn on i'll go i'll get up out of bed you know i could turn on the light switch
nothing right doesn't go on and so then i'll be like oh the power's out so i'll go get my flashlight
and i'll you know hit the button on the flashlight and when the flashlight doesn't go on now i know like
okay there's something weird's going on right and usually there's some kind of a
very profound weird um encounter with a non-ordinary force that takes place after that so for
example one time um after having the light having tried to turn the light on it doesn't go on
i walked out my room my room and up my hallway there's a bathroom door the bathroom door was
mostly closed and fascinatingly for reasons i would love to know why there was a small paper lunch bag
in the crook of where the door hinge would would be and um i reached out to to hold
or to open or close the bathroom door and there was this force on the other side that was monstrous and
profound and electrical and like chaotically vit like shaking the door back and forth very violently
and i've encountered this force um hypnagogically and and you know it's interesting the difference
between hypnagogia and hypnopompia and human experience because in my experience hypnagogia
um it can it can involve things like false awakenings or bizarre sounds or visions or so forth and
hypnopompia tends to be different it doesn't i don't usually have visions i can experience sleep paralysis
um in fact that's the most common thing that happens although although i rarely have hypnopompic
experience or i have hypnagogic experience very regularly um though i'm not here to talk about my
experience so what do you suppose sarah is the source of illumination in drinking
i've been really interested in this idea and one of the things i did think is bioluminescent
in the actual human organism itself um or accessing um
the collective experience of the world like residual light coming in through the collective
but this i've written i have written articles about this a long time ago because i was really
interested because there is actual bioluminescence in the human organism i discovered um and
it is one of the reasons why you know um james cameron it was inspired to create all the bioluminescent
scenes in avatar because of a lucid dream and i think that by that experience of bioluminescence there's
something really um pre-birth remembering about that i think there's something to do with by a bioluminescent
experience of reality before birth
yes often when i ask people this question they
haven't i mean most people find it very surprising
um and by the way you you spoke of both you and the woman with um eidetic memory
having white dreams and i think that's amazing um but have you ever had black dreams
i had one black dream when i had an out-of-body experience once and uh you know i read a lot about
uh tibetan dream yoga and this meditating in the abyss but i'd never it's one thing i've never experienced
and then uh i did some remote viewing experiments in a shepherd site in the brecon beacons and i actually
had a kind of um it was it wasn't quite a panic attack but it was like a kind of
a weird panic where you know when you sort of panic sometimes you it's like you pop out of your
ordinary timeline i had an experience like that during the day basically where it was um uh driven
i had like a an episode of fear a very sort of sudden brief episode of fear that made me i i kind
of collapsed on the floor in a bit of sort of overly dramatic way but when i did it was like i just
split off a bit from my body and um and then when i got my senses back had a drink of water i felt okay
again i felt revived really revived in fact like i felt like i could have walked had so much energy i
could have walked all night and um then that night i had an out-of-body experience that i was floating
next to my body sleeping on the bed and uh i could move my fingertips in micro movements and i was creating
these kind of like uh snowflake patterns by moving my fingertips in the blackness
and then i was meditating i was in an abyss and i was meditating and it was just the abyss and whilst
i was there i was thinking oh this is the abyss this is what i've been reading about in tibetan dream
yoga and i don't think it it was a timeless experience because it didn't last any perceivable
period of time um but that's the only time i've had that experience brilliant i i mean i underwent
um a problematical transformation of my sleep and dreaming at the end of 2018 which i thought was
personal to me but after talking with many others it turns out that it wasn't personal to me which is
very concerning and troubling um but uh first i stopped dreaming as far as i could tell and then i
started having dreams that were just black there i was having like a dream and relating with situations
of people and stuff but there's no visual information um and i learned so much by questing to understand
what the hell was going on right and one of the things i'll just give a couple of the things very
briefly um dreaming seems to me at this point now we're aware that we have what we call circadian rhythms
right and i think again you know we have one thing in mind so we think oh your circadian rhythm
it's one thing it's just your you know your body's relationship with time and the light and blah blah
blah no no no it's way more sophisticated it's like an orchestra of things right a chorus actually and
there's a conductor there there are multiple conductors actually of your circadian rhythms
and what never occurred to me before before things messed up in my dreaming
was that there are oneric rhythms right and normally your circadian rhythms and your oneric rhythms they
synchronize right so when they're synchronized things go well but what ended up happening to me
is my oneric rhythms split off from my circadian rhythms and so my body was wanting my i don't know
what was wanting some aspect of my being was expecting to be dreaming at like one two three
four or five pm meanwhile i'm i'm not asleep at that time right if i fall asleep at that time vivid
dreams if i'm not asleep at that time no dreaming so these two things can say again that's really
interesting so i learned so much and and i you know i'm really interested in um like
i'm really interested in the knowledge that you carry and the insight and your history and all
these things so i'm resistant to just going on about what i've learned but i did understand that
we have oneric rhythms and that under circumstances that cause them to desynchronize and let's be really
clear about one simple thing if you viciously slaughter the environment the living environment it messes
up the features that synchronize human dreaming right now each person humans themselves are like a
topology so there's like people who are so sensitive that in the early days of the problem
they're going to sense it right away and there's people who are so not sensitive or or their faculties
are so richly um endowed that they're going to keep dreaming and mem and their memory will stay
you know brilliant and they'll so humans are a topology right they're like mountains and valleys
and i suspect that you're given your history with dreaming and stuff you're you're a mountain
right so you might not have the same kinds of experience that i would have even though many people
that i know um and actually mostly men have had a similar experience at the same time right around
the end of 2018 started having problems with sleep dreaming motivation all kinds of things that's a
that's a story for another time um so the thing is are dreaming there are these is there an event
in the real world that you attribute oh yeah i mean the devastation of the environments the
devastation of the remaining ecologies is huge but there's also things like computation which humans
think is just free as much computation as you want like just get they just give that stuff to you you
know it's not gonna hurt anybody there might be did the humans ever think that there might be like a
constant about the amount a constant in nature relating to the amount of computation you can get away
with on a living world before it starts collapsing the relational integrity of the organisms no
the humans don't they don't think about things like that ever there's not one person thinking
about that me maybe so there's and you know was it the large hadron collider those physicists are
doing dangerous stuff within machines i don't trust them much yeah but um no there could be 10 different
things changes in the sun a transformation the sun is pulling the earth through time space and the
humans think like oh time space is just the same everywhere you go no it isn't time space is
energy it's energetically different as you travel through it and the sun is actually doing something
other than just making light and warmth which the humans you know think oh that's just a big explosion
in space it makes light and warm um it's really disturbing what the camera is doing to my eyebrows
but anyway i'm gonna ignore that so yeah we could be in a different like the sun transforms and that
certainly affects our dreaming um the relationship between the sun the moon the solar system itself
where we are in relation to inside the galaxy where our galaxy is in relation to other galaxies
a lot of these things have hugely long timelines but we can move from a place where dreaming is much more
easily um um sort of funded energetically to a place where it's much less easily funded and those people
probably like yourself who are well practiced and sort of their dreaming muscles are very vital
may not even necessarily notice although if they're paying very close attention to their dreams
they might notice a transformation not not the same way as like the sudden cessation of dreams that i
experience um but yeah there are oneric rhythms they are very complex it's a symphony it's a chorus
right and there's a variety of conductors when they are synchronized with our circadian rhythms things
go well under certain circumstances that synchron those those good things can split off right um
now there's so many more things and i know how are we on time let me just ask you how are you doing
yeah i'm okay i'm okay i mean i probably um can't do too much longer because i have to watch the
storyteller okay i like to watch fairy tales before i go to bed beautiful um what what are you going to
watch tonight well i don't know there's this uh 80s tv series that we've been watching called the
storyteller last night we watched uh hands my hedgehog which is one of my favorite like it was a fairy
tale collect by the brothers grim and my dreaming last night was all me being hands the hedgehog it
was ridiculous um okay so do we have like what 20 minutes half hour what do you think yeah sure 20
minutes okay great there's so many things i want to talk about um and i hope maybe we could have a
second conversation sometime soon because you're like you're like a library and i'm not going to be
i'm not going to be satisfied with the chapter i'm sorry i just i want a lot more whatever you can
share i want more of it um so
so many threads um
do you think why is my camera oh my camera's trying to focus on my god this camera and then
that's really carefully sets up before i do another interview um
all right there's a bunch of little notes i've taken here oh yeah this one's really important
so i strongly suspect that our distant and that for our distant ancestors experiences that we might
think of as psychic were very common much more common than they are now and they were probably
partly more common because the biodiversity of the earth was vastly superior to what it is now and also
there were no machines right so there's nothing machines just dump entropy into living environments
and organisms do the opposite right they they are negantropic so they they they do something sort of
thermodynamically impossible and they do it together with and for each other it's kind of a chorus thing
and and you know cory is is involved here i think um but uh so you know we have two problems and one of them is
is humans tend to think that we they tend to think of of human beings they mattify what it is to be
human according to the machines they've built so like they eventually people are like oh the heart
it's just a pump it just pumps stuff you know it's nothing like what the heart is brain that's just a
computer yeah nope sorry nothing brains made computers and without hearts you don't have brains there are no
brains without hearts let's be really clear about that so i think the egyptians and the greeks and and
the ancient peoples were right uh not just right they were insightful about what is the core of us
what is the core us right and um well they learned all of this as well by very close observation of nature
which we are deprived of now because most people don't grow up with that the luxury of
an incredible close observation of nature and when i was little although i lived in a bit of
a crummy area in croydon which is like a suburb of south london i did live next to this field where
the gypsies used to keep their horses and animals and things and um i had a sort of weirdly kind of
fantasy nature childhood even though it was a kind of on a main road next to industrial estate i had this
little pocket of wild nature next to me and i would spend hours just looking in a pond or a spider's
web and being on my own or being with animals and cultivating relationships like the gypsies left their
goats there so i used to be friends with the goats and i'd go over there and i'd have all these goats
around me and i would talk to the goats and you know and i like to think for myself as well as being in
a film talking to these goats and my mom and dad used to call me heidi because all these goats would
follow me around all the time and um and i had an appreciation for you know an innate and intuitive
sense for that as above so below and i think what you're saying about the cosmos is really interesting
because um i was thinking about this just the other day when i was meditating i had this kind of
sudden feeling of really acknowledging that i'm spinning like a thousand plus miles on the axis
of the earth you know like yeah we have calibrated to feel still in an incredibly chaotic time space in
reality like the amount of galactic movements cosmic movements rotations spirals and we're also
spinning anti-clockwise and you know and so in my my um when i was meditating i was thinking about the
fact that you know we've constructed this clock and this way of viewing time as moving forward the way a
clock hand moves over a dial and um that the earth is turning anti-clockwise and when we sleep at night
when we're lying our beds we're just surrendering with the movement the natural movement of the earth
and like you say the that kind of uh symphony of the movements of the cosmos and we're part of that
chorus and the dreaming the state of dreaming allows you to kind of recalibrate to that cosmic time space
which is why i think dreams can be so healing because you're naturally aligned to cosmic time space
as opposed to trying to live in this uh relative time of existing as a human being in this planet that
um is subject to clock time and subject to you know hours in the day and and whatnot uh it's why
i really do enjoy waking up at dawn because you get this sense at dawn of this great uh communion between
the heavens and earth that uh and you know i was mentioned having that dream where i was standing on the
moon and when i was standing on the moon seeing the earth turn on its axis i had this fantastic embodied
gnosis about the fact that i live on a planet that moves through a universe and not the sun rises above
the horizon like i felt it in my body and i read later on about how astronauts when they go to into
space and they see the earth from a distance they get this overview effect it's like a psychedelic
it's associated with the psychedelic experience as well of having this overview effect that helps you
release your fear of death because you feel that you're part of something much bigger and just
recognizing like this is what i think prophecy is about ultimately and the healing events that occur
in the telestereon and the telespherion is that um prophecy and the um apocalypsis of revelation
is that sudden awareness of the fact that you're part of the cosmos and that's all you need to be okay
because you'll never stop being part of the cosmos yes we imagine death to be an ending and it certainly
is the ending of this animal body that i am familiar with that part is real that thing comes to an end um
but it could be a waking up it could be a waking up from this dream i mean i yeah no i have so many
crazy ideas about this especially um over the past few months i've been fascinated by death my entire
life as i am fascinated by dreaming as i'm fascinated by organisms um but i want to be careful because i know
our time is limited and there's so many more things i want to ask you i'm like a kid in a library right
i want i want like nine more books um so i'll tell my publisher that yeah yeah please um
i will say a few things briefly it occurs to me that um
as if
the word god is so value laden but i'm going to be clumsy and use it anyway as if a ray of the light
of god falls asleep or even dies and wakes up in a human body and then lives out this
this this you know this continuum of material existence and can actually do things with stuff
right which is pretty exciting to have hands and there's consequences if you make a mistake and all
that stuff that's pretty amazing and then um and and while in the human body this ray of light or the
splinter of of the divine or origin if we don't want to use the word god it falls asleep in dreams
right how incredibly beautiful is that ah and then when i die that aspect of origin or the divine or god
is resurrected right so my death is the resurrection of something else and you know we seem to think
that um we come from before our life right because we think in timelines and we know we were conceived and
born and i i come from before but i i think it's important to at least entertain the possibility that
we come from after what if a life is the wisdom of our death leaking back into time day by day moment
by moment and our dreaming is actually the sort of flower that that attracts that that the bee of the
death of the intelligence of our own death and and reviv and like vitalizes it into our lives day
by day moment by moment there's so many other ways to imagine the the majesty and the beauty
and the creativity of existence but the humans are not very creative when they they just stick to like
the the road puzzle the jigsaw that they were given right they gave you this piece you start over here
you die over there that's all you need to know son there's something like that going on what's actually
going on is so ecstatically beautiful and mysterious and orgasmic right it's like it's ecstasy literally
like unprisoning and you know when in my own glimpses of of insight and of wonder and awe at the
nature of existence and i like you i've been this way my whole i was born i was a problem right i was
the same kind of problem that i think you've been um you know i'm fascinated by all of these questions
and quests so yeah i think there's some other ways to think about death i don't think it's the end of
anything except this human body and i think we've become confused and we think like this human thing
is me i'd be really surprised if anything ceases to exist well i think it does have to do with our
perceptions of time and the ancients obviously perceived time differently they weren't um limited
to like the 24 hour clock they thought in these greater cycles of planetary movements of generational um
uh lifetimes they had understandings of ancestors and grandparents that went back you know hundreds and
hundreds of years they had that oral storytelling tradition for a very long time um whereas modern
people are lucky if they know what their great great grandparents did that there tends to be more
record in the ancient world of yes uh gone before of honoring ancestors of recognizing and you know
there's a concept as well which i find very interesting of like death medicine of actually eating of
dead things you know not just killed animals but of corpses or of mummy wrappings as a medicine
as a kind of uh um apotropaic magic to protect someone from death but also
one thing that i've come to sort of understand or feel about life is that life and death are actually
always entwined you know we're a bit living but we're also always a bit dying there are always cells
dying and there are always cells being born and that as above so below as within also as without so
i think that um by appreciating time as cyclical and cosmic intersecting cycles and spirals which
ancients do seem to record their view of time and space as being cosmic terrestrial
um spirit um if you have that sense then going to sleep every night is a small death that you wake up
from in the morning so when we die it's and it's a greater cycle of wakefulness moving to death and so
i just think it's going to be cycles spirals within spirals and that we're like life and anti-life all at the
the same time our dna is kind of like woven with life and death so there's always part of us that's
dying there's always part of us that's living and there's um you know rudolph steiner's book knowledge
of the higher worlds there's exercises in that where you try to cultivate your what he calls uh spiritual
organs to sense life and death and one of the exercises is that you sit with like a dead plant for
example um and contrast it with the experience of sitting with a living plant and you become
sensitive to the emanations of life or the the aura of life that comes off a living plant and the kind
of nothingness aura that comes off of a dead you know plant that's died and it's interesting doing
that you can walk down a road and you can walk in front of people's drives and if like a drive is
totally tarmacked over no life it's like this void and when you walk through a much more biodiverse
garden or something you get this sense and aura of of life so i think that like life is the matrix that
kind of holds the planet together so as you said like the more biodiversity the more life the more
diversity there is the greater life force this planet has and um the more power there is to life
and consciousness and i i think it's one of the things that um has skewed our idea about life on
the planet as well like you look at you know there's these ideas of law of attraction and abundance thinking
and all this kind of stuff and one of the things i noticed when you live in somewhere that's very
biodiverse that if a seed drops on the floor from your plate you know uh suddenly there'll be a
tomato plant growing you know you live somewhere like that things happen more quickly because that
spirit of generation is in the land that uh sense of life being uh life flourishing is actually the land
itself the soil itself and so um creating biodiversity helps to just increase the density
of life and makes energy flow more quickly forever for everything and everyone i think that i think
that it's a great gift to be able to crease create biodiversity and i hope that people will sort of
just naturally return to it and recognize it after a while because it's a it's actually like a treat
now a treat to be a nature experience by diversity yeah it's you know it's so bizarre the time we live
in right you see um commercials for suvs escape to nature right in an suv which is what's destroying
the nature you're escaping to um the irony isn't lost on me so many things there so i want to circle
back to something i was talking about briefly when i introduced humans medifying themselves as machines
the heart's a pump the brain's a computer so radio i think replaced or actually the telephone replaced
telepathy and radio replaced group telepathy and television replaced group dreaming and this is why
i think this is one of the reasons why i think you're such an amazing being because you get people
together to dream together and that is so important that's that's so crucial in this time this is the
thing we're not doing and the one of the reasons i was mentioning the south american practitioners
is that they were brilliant at this they knew right they would form a tight little pod of specialists
each with a unique specialization and they would go on dream missions right they weren't just asking
like what to do about some problem they would go on missions together like like an intelligence
like like a like a green beret team or something except the dream version you know what i'm saying
and so i think we were born for all of these things that most of us moderns have never tasted we we
never even imagined they were possible and group dreaming is so important you can imagine people
used to live in a cave together a long time ago they would go to sleep at exact pretty much exactly
the same time they would dream in the same space together every night inside a cave inside like a
womb like a womb in the earth an ancient womb in the earth like it's made of stone and stuff right and
and it's just it's a completely other universe of possibility in human intelligence awareness and
capacity faculty senses um i've always felt there's something like robert moss talks about this as well
of being like a dream detective there's something naturally about dreams and the way we experience
them which i think is always trying to reveal things to you and you know often we get caught
up in what is trying to reveal to us about our personal life or situation but i think it's trying
to reveal something bigger like a bigger mystery to us and i guess that's one thing that is missing
from um modern human experience is a real sense of mystery of what is still mysterious and i think
often of mystery being an actual kind of sense and feeling that people had up until relatively
recently like you think about we now know what outer space looks like what all other countries look like
we've seen photographs from everywhere we there's you know we think we can't imagine there's nothing
that is unimaginable to us like we know that there are hidden depths to the ocean but nothing's really
surprising or truly mysterious and i love thinking about um you know sailors that embarked on big
voyages and they thought they might drop off the end of the earth because stories told of sea monsters and
dropping on off the end of the earth and that really very few people find themselves in a situation
where they do not know what's going to happen at all they have no expectation of what kind of beasts
they might encounter in foreign lands for example so there's um there's a really there's a kind of uh
art that i really love which is sailors that went on some of these early voyages and drew pictures or
made paintings of the animals that they saw before without having the framework of context of previous
photographs or any expectation or anticipation so they'd see a tiger and that painting and drawing
of it looks weird probably not because they're not especially skilled artists but because their
perception of it is completely different to our perception which has a framework and an expectation
of what a tiger supposed to look like has a photograph as a reference point but encountering
something like this for the first time i mean it must have been truly magical and mind-blowing to
encounter an elephant without having any preconception about what an elephant could ever look like or that
it even existed in the world and not having names for things you know like talking about how uh words and
names for things act as anchors for us to build ideas about the way reality works and um you know this is one
one of the things i find fascinating about minimosini because she's the goddess and personification of
remembrance and i think that kind of remembrance that refers to is the um remembrance of the fact that
you are a product of the earth and starry heavens as they say in the you know the orphic gold tablets
minimosini is a psychopomp in that tradition and she reminds people when they die when she takes
them into hades that they shouldn't drink from the waters of oblivion so they forget their divine
birthright they need to wait and drink the waters of memory so that they can remember and i think
there's something like the tibetan dream yoga in that that you're supposed to remember yourself back
into the the kind of the all the cosmic source
wow um so one of the things that stood out i just want to mention before i forget
we have a broad library of faculties senses that we don't develop because we think there's just five
senses you know thinking you think things you smell them you taste them you see whatever it's nonsense
we have myriad faculties there's this whole we're born with like thousands of seeds of these faculties
that don't get developed and dreaming there's a there's a whole library of dreaming faculties
that we don't even think about that right as moderns so you're you're like such an your work
is so important sarah because you're helping people to resurrect these intelligences these faculties
these possibilities you're getting people to dream together and to um organize their intention
around dreaming together oh it's absolutely brilliant i think that's so important and and
the thing that you were saying about the the tiger you know photographs normalize novelty
right they just cut the novelty right off they just snip the novel part off and this is a photograph
of an orchid now you know every orchid in the world you don't have to go see orchids or relate
with them or you know anything so there's a there's a huge problem with in humans with representation
and in a sense representation especially explicit representation dreaming has many enemies one of
them is explicit identity and one of them is representations right that's very interesting
because um one of the things that i really miss uh about children's books is that they have photographs
in them or um digital illustrations rather than paintings and drawings and i think there's something
about a painting of an animal uh or like i had this animal encyclopedia that i was obsessed with as a
kid um hamlin's encyclopedia of animals and i absolutely loved it and if i ever see it in a shop
i'll buy it because i love the paintings in it and it does weird dreamlike things so for example it has
paintings of herons but it shows all different herons the heron family tree in one tree and that's the sort of
thing that i find in my dreams all the time i think because this book inspired me and this
painting and drawing is like the poetry to prose it's leave space for your imagination to fill the
gaps and if you're not leaving space to fill gaps yes yes that's so crucial um you know i like role
playing games because i was exposed to tolkien when i was a kid oh wait this and um i used to play a text
based role play role playing game because you had to imagine everything there were no pictures um
all right
the space for the imagination that's so much okay the other thing i wanted to get back to is
you know the the i think the greeks they did not think of seeing as passive they thought of the gaze
as like rays no wait i i misspoke certain enlightened people among the ancient greeks
who actually thought carefully about these matters and maybe it was common for everyone to think this
way but but it was as if rays of light were coming out of the eyes right and i'm pretty sure there's some
research that shows that our our eyes actually produce photons and possibly when we close our eyes
the play of those photons um the phosphenes on on our eyelids may seed the first moments of dreaming
experience and in my own experiences of hypnagogia which if i've got it right is the beginning liminal
space and hypnopompia is the ladder of waking between dreaming waking so i wanted to mention that i i think
your bioluminescence thing it's important and could be could be real um i'm going to look for that
encyclopedia and send you a copy of it i want to make sure you get one of those yeah um and i don't
want to keep you uh much longer if if we're running out of time what what's your how's the time thing
there yeah i probably do need to go now because i'm i'm getting i like to not look at a screen for
too long although i will watch tv it's a bit different right right right no i would i would love
for us to have a second conversation because there's about 19 billion other things i want to ask you
but right now i just feel so grateful what a privilege it is to have this time with you and i
so celebrate your work in the world you are like one of those you're a force of nature sarah you're doing
the most amazing work you could possibly do and you're you're helping the humans to remember the
primacy and the vitality of dreaming together and even to practice it you know on on greek islands
and things right so that it's just pretty good pretty lucky i'm i'm such a fan of what you're doing
and i don't mean if you know in the trivial sense i just really believe in what you're doing it's so
beautiful it's such a privilege to have this time with you i'm so grateful oh thank you so much it was a
great thank you so much i'd love to talk to you again as well you know i know you're really
interested in linguistics and language and actually hieroglyphs is something that i'm super interested
in and how egyptian hieroglyphs kind of change your perception of the world because you know the the
hieroglyphs of the medu neger god's words and one of the things i've thought about quite a lot is how
for a literate person a scribe in ancient egypt when certain configurations of real world things would
manifest in their waking reality they could actually read them like the real things of the world could
organize themselves into a readable word which i just love that idea so the hieroglyphs is a really
good way of um of changing and influencing dreams actually and it could be a really good tool
because i think uh there's something about for me like micro movements of writing proper pen to paper
pencil to paper painting and drawing and i think there's there's perhaps something in the brain
where the area is associated with those kind of micro movements of writing of craft of making things
that a friend of mine said to me that she recalls her dreams much better when she's knitting in the
morning there's something about the act of knitting that helps her remember things so i think there's
something about um uh writing properly and as you're doing as you're enacting it it seems to help you
remember so it's interesting to me that mimosini is also the goddess of eloquence and eruditeness
so she's a goddess of sense making which i think is really important so she helps you
to make sense of the vastness of life and the cosmos um and as she's a product of heaven and earth
as well she's the daughter of uranos and uh gaia and she's the source of all inspiration in the world
because she's the mother of all of the muses so yeah dreaming's like dreaming can take you into all
kinds of avenues and i'm disappointed that it isn't more studied as a avenue to sort of explore
consciousness because i think it's fascinating especially with regards to dreaming and memory
because memory is obviously vitally important to our experience of dreams and there seems to be
like almost a dreaming memory um that is only accessible within dreams um or in these special
states of consciousness and that's something i think should be studied a bit more um who cares
science scientifically studying stuff what does it prove where does it get us just live a better life
yes there's so much here because like we suppose that outer space is the really interesting crazy
amazing thing that we don't know anything about there's no reason to believe that we can't explore
it with dreaming and there's and really we also suppose that out there's space out there and then
inside here is just the regular stuff that's not true like there's some way in which
in the way that we are beings and in the way that we are intelligences and in the way that we are
members of a common origin right it's as if we can use the dreaming senses to do something that resembles
both like paleontology archaeology right the ancients are alive in us and the dreaming senses can contact
them directly and we can also do something resembling time travel right which is to see the future
oh god what am i it's very interesting to me that like all um ancient dream interpretation is preoccupied
with predicting the future or reckoning with the future and then that isn't done in terms of like
direct visions of the future it's done because the entire world is oracular the entire world is revealing
itself all the time just by existing and um if you can read the signs and the patterns in the world at
any moment in any configuration and any arrangement of things in any area that you can read to the future
so you know that for example like that sort of material cultural aspect of dreaming in the ancient
world reveals so much about the perception of time and space in ancient egypt and ancient mesopotamia that
the future is readable always in the now and the past is always a dream so we can always explore the past
in dreams and i i've always felt that there's something about um in a dream you can
scale and time become irrelevant really and perspective and perception of time has to do with
your position in time space so in the dream your position in time space uh changes from being you
know behind the eyes looking into the world to all eyes viewing from every conceivable angle so you have
this omnipotence where you can see close up and far away at the same time um and so the experience of
time space expands because you aren't you aren't on this kind of linear trajectory through time space you
are time space uh so you know this is why i've thought that you can exist in a dream forever because
time is uh detached from your ordinary linear journey through the world
oh my goodness um so you know i have i've been very curious about lucid dreaming and i have experiences
of dream lucidity i don't chase it too often it's not like these days but i'm really curious about
one thing that i that i just want to leave with you which is lucid dreaming seems to be this gentle
intrusion of the waking mind into the dreaming context gentle enough that it doesn't cause the
bubble to collapse and one of the things that i heard a moment ago when you were talking about
seeing in dreaming was an answer to the question
what is the source of illumination it is the many it is the chorus of seers
all right the chorus of seers and yes the nature of oracles is fundamental to this discussion and our
future discussions um so what i'm really i think what happened over time is the same thing that
happened to us in a single human lifetime which is that we used to be dreaming while we were awake as
children and that was slowly getting evicted by language and enculturation and object relationships
and all of these things it was just getting pushed away and part of what's causing i think the the
damage in the dreaming manifold of the humans in our time right now that i and others have experienced
is that thing that kills dreams it's not satisfied with evicting them from our waking world it wants to
make them go away and i want to talk about that in a future conversation so i'm going to leave you with
a couple of seeds you know a little bit of food for thought here because i think a lot about this what is
it that destroys the imagination of our childhood as we get older and thankfully you uh you obviously
keep yours alive you're going to go watch fairy tales in a minute which i think is awesome well i
think that's it i think playing um and stories are two really good things to keep dreaming um so the thing
that i was really curious about is that i think our ancestors our ancient ancestors were dreaming while
they were awake i think there wasn't such a strong distinction between dreaming and waking so i would
describe that it reminds me of bicameral mind julian james's bicameral mind ideas um that yeah there there
wasn't a hard there wasn't so much black and white in terms of awake and asleep and especially bringing
back in this idea of mystery there were a lot more unknowns and unknowns um tend to invite the
imagination so you create and fill the gaps with unknowns so i think about something like and the
night hags and the screech owls and how owls you know even now given given the sort of lack of
biodiversity we don't see owls quite so often but owls tend to be um you know not too fond of being seen by
humans
oh sorry
sorry i was just getting a package that i have to sign for um so i missed the last part of what you
said um i was just gonna say you know i think about there are a lot more unknown quantities in the
dark for ancient people for example lots of half-seen mysterious things um that the nowadays we can
photograph in high definition with night cameras and all sorts of stuff but things like just something
as simple as an owl um the the night demons the lilith types or the lilitsu the the the entities that came
as spirits of air and possessed people at night um the owls viewed suddenly mysteriously surprisingly
glimpsed and only seen you know the sort of glitter of their eyes and their sounds would have been
experienced in a different way because they didn't have a high definition photograph of them during the
day you know it's a complete there's so much there so the sun actually declares
identity to our perception right it tells you this is blue this is a cup it's this and this and this
right and this is very similar to the waking mind's experience of cognizing identity and the linguistic
experience of that is a tree right i know what that is it's a tree when actually everything that
we look at has infinite qualities so so the idea of deriving an identity it's useful i understand
it pragmatically and we'll have longer conversations about this later but what i want to say is moonlight
doesn't do that moonlight suggests and it's it's almost hypnotic right it's pareidolic it produces
pareidolia if i'm pronouncing that word that i've read a lot correctly and so it suggests um strangeness
and what you're saying about the owl right you're you're you're walking along and suddenly for a
brief moment from the blackness of of the night right a white thing just appears suddenly before
you and then just as suddenly disappears like go ahead glides you know if you've ever seen an owl in
the middle of the night it kind of glides silently silently it is uh like a specter and one thing i was
going to say about children and why children tend to have such vivid dreams as well is they're learning
language still that's they're being instructed uh in the framework of how to perceive reality so how to
proceed you know to and and i think one of the really good ways of uh encouraging that kind of dream
consciousness is to try to forget the names of things you know do some exercises where you forget the
names of things or you try to suspend your um knowing of of stuff i remember having an experience
uh a few years ago this brilliant experience i was in the british museum and opposite the british museum
uh is uh swedenborg's house and swedenborg is a christian mystic who had a lot of amazing dream
experiences you probably know and um so i went in there to have a look i knew about his experience with
dreaming and i was reading the bookshop and then i saw there was a talk upstairs about um south american
magical realists not novels and i love south american magical realism novels so i was like i'm
going to go to that talk and then the guy giving the talk was this uh guy i know called william rolandson
who i had seen talk at the psychedelic conference breaking convention like the year before on elves and
fairies and perceptions of elves and fairies and so after the talk i went up to him and we've got mutual
friends and i was saying oh i saw you talk at breaking convention about elves and fairies and
he said oh you're the one that's interlucid dreaming and we were talking about dreams a bit and he said
to me oh i don't know that you know i'm dreaming i might be dreaming now everything all those little
badges in your jacket they may represent like scenes from my life and i was like that's weird because all
these little badges on my jacket they represent scenes from my life and um and then we had this moment
of standing there like thinking maybe we are dreaming like properly thinking maybe we are dreaming
right now i think william's quite famous for doing this to people actually i later discovered
anyway at the exact moment i'm thinking this could this actually be a dream a woman in the front of the
audience turns around and on her cap is embroidered is this a dream and then i had this um like full
body experience of i'm actually in a dream like this is amazing it felt incredible and then you know you
get like a sort of charge of i don't know what it is some sort of neurotransmitting chemicals that just
made me feel amazing and um and then i was sitting on the train on the way home later on in the evening
and i just decided to um stop knowing what everything was called and thinking i knew what i was seeing like
i just i just looked and i had everything went weird and um kind of fluid and moving and i saw the train
as being like a serpent instead of a train i saw the seats become the tutankhamun uh uh golden blue
fingers like nothing was the normal framework of what you see even though i was seeing the real
world at the same time as well and it was it was like i recognized it was the way like a child sees
the world before they know the words for things and they know what to expect and then years and years
later i mean this is 15 years later um i started this project called dream palace athens where we did
this 10-day residency with artists coming to athens and i started working with a woman who runs a studio
in london um who's very into how dreaming kind of moves through the arts and how you know uh collectively
dreams can produce art and people can work together through dreaming and um we started working together
and and we were communicating on facebook and i looked at an old photograph of her on facebook
and i realized that she had been the woman in the audience that day with the cap that said is
this a dream embroidered on it and and the whole exp you know those moments where you feel like
you're living a dream they seem to hint at that's the true nature of reality though that it seems to be
this uh there's something about dreams where it's trying to tell you all the time that it is all a dream
and that in waking life every now and again you encounter these things that test
are trying to show you that actually there's a lot more sort of reality is a lot more malleable a lot
more dreamlike and um dreaming is a very uh fertile arena to practice magic oh that's so beautiful and
it's right with the topic that i was just about to briefly introduce which is
i've come to understand that the nature of lucid dreaming involves the gentle intrusion of certain
aspects of waking awareness into the dreaming context if it's not gentle it it collapses the manifold
right it's the difference between like a penetration and a sort of um circum circumnavigation
right um or it can be seen that way and the one thing that always surprised me was that i'd never
heard a single person ask about lucid waking
what's the experience over here that is the the converse of lucid dreaming and that would be something
like what you've just described where the dreaming aspect enters into the waking
mind but doesn't collapse it into dreaming right and so i'm fascinated by the possibilities of lucid waking
and you seem like one of the best people i've ever come across to have a longer conversation about
this with very soon let's do it then let's do it absolutely next time next time i'll be in greece so that
would be great even better yes um when we get done somehow let's see i think you have my email address
so i'll email you a question about where to get that encyclopedia to you okay cool
oh thank you so much darren that's great ah sarah just what a joy i'm so grateful for this time
and i can't wait to learn again together more um just what a fabulous half i very much look forward
to to you talking to maria as well because she is she is a true mr gog that woman she's yeah i can't
wait and thank you so much for introducing me to her very grateful all blessings wise dreams
you too lovely lovely to meet you lovely to meet you lovely to meet you lovely to meet you bye-bye bye-bye for now
