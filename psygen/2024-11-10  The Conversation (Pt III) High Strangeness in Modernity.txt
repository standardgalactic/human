so yeah i was saying that i have seen images of what appear to be human females
that have an immediate transigenic effect that resembles the effect of exposure to psychedelic
drugs and that i found this extremely concerning and you asked me why what about it i found
concerning and i said i don't want to be exposed to images that can directly hijack my nervous system
and you know like i'm not even gonna yeah i guess i am going to so in a situation like that
a human being is incapable of understanding what is being done to their nervous system
and whether or not they're being covertly programmed or instructed by such interactions
um there's literally no way to tell right so what do you mean there's no way to tell
how would you tell okay so how would you tell if there are if there's essentially emotional and
psychological steganography in an image that you're being exposed to that was designed by a machine
to directly manipulate and or instruct you you'd have no way to tell you can't detect it
can you can you define that word statinography yeah steganography is the concealment so one of the things
i was working on with my friend forest is a program called steg that would allow us to do steganography
in any image that we choose so that we could like post an image online and only people with
the decryption code could determine could get the actual message from the image
facebook would not be able to google would not be able to we could actually stegan steganagraphy
wait steganographies our emails so that they appeared as glyphs or symbols and only the person
with the key could decrypt them that would save us from having our texts scanned by machines
um so steganography which is often used by intelligence organizations and also terrorist organizations
is simply hiding data in a in a image right so you get an image of a naked girl it actually has a map
of a military site in it that kind of thing so crazy so what i'm talking about is the capacity to steganographically
encode instructions to human nervous systems in images so you're you're saying that there are ways
in which images can influence our consciousness and and or our nervous systems that we would have no way
of knowing i mean that's yeah you're right i wouldn't know if that was happening at all you have no way
i'm i'm not entirely certain um how that would be possible ordinary images already hijack your nervous
system so yeah so then it sounds like what you're talking about is unavoidable um it's not unavoidable
well i'll just close my eyes then um yeah plural responses aren't going to help us here but but i
mean like like i can't stop myself from seeing so then it sounds like if images are already hijacking our
consciousness in that way then yeah not much to do i just made a i just did an interview with uh topo
toparek the curator of the beware of images facebook site um he's a graphic designer who's using images
to warn people about their dangers facebook throttled the out of the site he had 300 000 followers
and then he started getting like four views on his posts yeah i just did an interview with him um
what's his name sergio toparek topo very cool amazing we had an amazing talk
so my point was and there's a lot of complex points here like humans tend to think
that our minds are separate from what's going on for example in computers
and they're not even if there's physical separation right between my brain and the entire internet
um that that physical separation is compromised by the fact that the people around me
are being influenced um even if there's no
right even if there's like no even if there's no metaphysical aspects to the human cognizant which i
thoroughly doubt um the problem with one of the problems with ai in general
and with the internet first is that it's influencing everyone around you so you know even if there is
some kind of putative separation there's no separation you're going to be influenced whether
you use the internet or not because you're going to be exposed to other humans at the very least
and that's presuming separation between your mind and the human cognizant which there isn't
so does that make any sense so far yeah for sure okay so even if i don't look at ai images of women
right even if i just stop seeing them which is going to be really hard if i'm using the internet or a
smartphone at all um other people will be looking at those images and they will be directly influencing
their behavior for certain i promise you straight up that china and russia are on top of this if the united
states isn't and you know over the past like three years i've started to see images of asian women
that look nothing like any asian woman i've ever seen like huge breasts thin waist tall tiny wide hips
um i'm not saying that no no asian women like this exist what i'm saying is i'm being barraged with
these kinds of images primarily of chinese women that's not accidental right that's that's a strategy
that's being deployed purposefully by china sure
so this is quite terrifying this had not occurred to me as a likely outcome of ai
uh influence and i mean there's much weirder possibilities of these dangers vastly weirder
that are quite staggering i'm not trying to scare you um i just i take these threats you know i study
human communications behavior so this is my wheelhouse so what are the repercussions of being shown these
women um thousands of them you're being primed right about what's beautiful what's desirable
what you can and cannot have access to at the very very least images of women have always had a
priming effect on the male and female populations of nations at least since the beginning of pornography
one of the driving forces of the development of the internet and certainly during the 70s 80s and 90s
when magazines like playboy and penthouse and hustler became popular but these days i mean it's vastly
vastly more pregnant and you know multi-branched we're entering the age where our nervous systems
are about to be directly captured by technology and most of the people around you are going to be in
that state so you can you know you can sort of i don't know what what can actually be done we have to
one of the things that i think is important that we do as soon as humanly possible is establish a
second branch of the internet that's protected from these things because if we don't it's over i mean
it's literally over dude within a very short period of time the tech will be able to read your heart rate
um skin conductance uh pupil dilation your respiration and surface sweat on your body it'll also be able to
read and analyze micro gestures in your facial muscles once that kind of happens it's we're
fucking done for we've got to enter we've got to produce a second branch of the internet that we can
know cannot be subjected to such technologies and if the technologies become ubiquitous so that they're
unavoidable and then the second branch has to utilize them for our benefit right we have to collect that
data ourselves analyze it ourselves and use it to educate ourselves and perhaps produce immunity i feel
like there's a fallacy in that i'd love for you to show it to me uh like sort of using the same
technology that you're scared that will destroy us to try and help us it seems like that that's uh
i let me try to put it into words so it's not just a feeling um
it seems risky because how could you know that it's not being compromised and also um
you know i've heard the argument enough times that technology is neutral it's the way that you use it
but you know i'm suspicious of the internet being a positive thing period
so
why would
why would trying to use it in similar ways that it's being used against us be good for us
like it seems like unplugging would be the the best move no chance of that helping you everyone around
you doesn't have another option every single person you know and those cultures you live in don't have
another option i mean we just witnessed the result of psyops on the united states in the election
so what are you going to do like leave organized countries i there are some options you could move
to tamara in portugal right go totally off grid but tamara's in portugal
so hey you know where are you going to go outer space but um i can address each of those objections
i think and by the way when you hear that little sound in the background that's just a noise to
remind us that we're being recorded since the iphones now have the option to record calls which i've
been waiting for um all right so the first objection is how can we use a technology that's harming us
to benefit us in other words how can we use a technology that's harming us to protect us from the
technology that's harming us and we're facing this particular problem with every aspect
of cognition because you're being scripted by the english language and by the users of english around
you to exert your experiential world according to the rules and categories of commonly used english
that's extremely dangerous so if it's true that we can't use technology to protect us from the
technology we're trying to protect ourselves from then it should be impossible for us to learn things
about language and our relationship with categories and identity that would give us immunity to some of
the gambits that we're subject to as users of english we can't get rid of language we live in a world
where language is everywhere but we can actually learn about language in the same way we can learn about
psychology or neuro-linguistic programming or priming of humans with images and scenes
so all of these things we can learn about and in the ways that we learn about them we will gain some
degree of liberty from their effect we have the same problem with machines we can't get rid of machines
they're killing everything um but it doesn't but if we're going to be forced to use machines we could use
them more intelligently that's one of my perspectives on the first question
or the first objection excuse me so um would you agree that by learning more about how we cognize
and language's effects on us we can acquire some immunity from some of those effects
yeah i definitely believe that okay me too otherwise we're kind of done with talking right like there's
no chance for um and would you also agree that the ordinary uneducated language user is subject to a
variety of con games gambits and um disempowerments that that occur uh naturally i would say that
they're not only vulnerable to that they're also likely um producing it the same way that a virus injects
a cell and then starts to make itself brilliant we agree about that i yes they are um reproducing
the contagion every time they make face noises um they're reinforcing previous disabling behaviors
and perspectives with language and cognition and specifically with identity right what something
is as we discussed in that uh extinction audio meaning okay so that's the first objection and the
second objection is oh that's dangerous right um i get it and this is why i have resisted
for nearly 25 years now attempting to implement the knowledge amp tech which would establish a second
branch of the internet um because i thought it was dangerous and other people who i you know ran through
the idea with they're like dude that can just be captured okay here's the problem it's kind of this sort of a problem
if you know someone is going to invade your house and poison every object in there so that
so that the objects influence you unconsciously constantly thereafter you kind of have two choices
you either have to do something you have to do what they're doing in a way that you prefer
that will overcome or possibly even destroy that whole agenda or you have to sit back and let them have
their way with you and we're facing the same problem now i used to think no the knowledge amp is too dangerous
now i think not doing the knowledge amp is more dangerous than doing it we've got to at least begin
the process of building technologies that are pro human liberty pro intelligence pro human education
and that are separated from advertising pornography psyops and so forth ai actually gives us the capacity
to i mean i'm using the word ai rather uh trivially here what i mean is heuristic algorithms
those give us the capacity to do that stuff with and for each other in our own way and we can encrypt the
analytic data with you know very powerful forms of encryption perhaps um developed by all by ai systems
so that the analytic data stays with us and is useless to anybody who gets a hold of the uh what i call the
artifact yeah we gotta try if if we don't do something
in a very short period of time i'm talking less than five years we're not going to be able to be
human anymore like this is incipient danger this is like right on the edge of everything people are
worried about trivial shit like should i should i really get a house or have a girlfriend you know
i don't really know about the future no dude there is some like if nuclear war and bioweapons
were the most significant threat and those are really significant threats um i think what i'm
talking about is presuming that one of those two things don't wipe us off the face of the earth the
threat i'm talking about is the most dangerous threat at the moment and and so this threat is very
cognitive heavy it's hugely it's it's very much in the realm of language and of uh images images
processing it's a lot of higher order intelligence yeah but it directly affects the soma so it's right
like it it transforms the nervous system immediately it can capture the nervous the human nervous system
so i have no doubt that based on what you're saying that um
understanding these intelligences in the way that they manipulate us and using them to our advantage
at least just the knowledge and understanding of how they work is useful
um and i'm also curious in exploring more somatic remedies more um you know how can we use the
intelligences of the body to combat these higher order things i think about it's a two-way street so
when my mind is spiraling and when i'm um hurting because of the mental constructs that i've trapped myself in
i can use my body as a reliable way i can focus on my breathing i can calm my heartbeat i can connect
with those older intelligences to counteract whatever mental traps that i've put myself in or have been put
in due to outside um you know forces and so when we're dealing with such subliminal
um attacks how can i trust my body how can i trust my nervous system to help pull me away in addition
to that understanding of the way that these things work yeah that's brilliant you want to rely on the
oldest stuff you can possibly touch right and that's definitely your cells your nervous system and so forth
however um so we never want to get rid of that right that's got to be the foundation but what's about
to happen is that our bodies aren't going to be our bodies like literally um it's possible to
directly transform the human nervous system and metabolism now and it's going to become you know
that's going to be the target of every existing government so i think we've got to establish
altruistic pro-human ai systems and a second internet that
that um where we gather our own analytics for each other uh and we can distribute those and use them in
all kinds of astonishing ways that i've mapped out you know pieces of um without compromising our
the the uh security of that information but you know we're right on the verge of everything we do gets
captured and you know capitalized upon for the sake of what we think is advertising but it's actually
not going to be advertising anymore it's going to be straight up manipulation forced slavery yeah yeah
right on the verge of it yeah because i mean i think like okay i can avoid getting cybernetics
that you know would rely on software which could be manipulated but then what happens when the chemicals
that are being put in my food is changing my metabolism working in tandem with the other
yeah exactly exactly right um and so my initial impression my knee-jerk reaction is i need to develop
a sense of self and a sense of community that is based off of core principles that
that cannot exist in the same space as these manipulations you also said something that uh
is common for humans to think about right counteract or you can use the word combat
and what i'm proposing is not common um anytime we form up i mean this is something we learned in
tai chi right you form up against an opponent it's over in tai chi that's the end of the encounter um so
we have to do the other thing we have to give people something so amazing and exciting and profound
to interact with and to interact with each other through that everybody defects from the old system nobody
wants to be left out we've got to establish a game b in the words of you know schmachtenberger and dark
web schmachtenberger just doesn't have this idea yet he's too he's become hopeless actually he just
sees oh this is the end there's nothing we can do it's over and as a threat analyst he's not wrong
but he's he's been defeated by the deluge of the meta crisis right and he doesn't see that it's
possible for us to build an entirely new way of being human together with tech and so then the argument
is the third objection is well can't that be captured
and the simple answer is yes anything can be captured true but if we establish a new branch of
civilization it's not merely resistant to capture it outperforms the capturing momenta
then we've got shot right and that's a little bit of what we do in the meetings
you know for a couple of hours we're about insight and i think one of the changes in the meetings that's
happened since i've been more active in them is it's gone from doom singing which was the primary
focus of the meetings to opportunity space and that's the shift we need right that's part of what
you're talking about when you say i want to be in touch with my body i want to use the ancient
intelligences in me and as me to resist but resistance as you know it's it's it's a losing
game if you're trying to resist mount eberus or the ocean or whatever right right for sure you have
to either establish a new path that um that operationalizes the momentums around you for
your benefit yeah right something like that yeah i think that's where language fails me or fails like
translating what i'm feeling because yeah it's not like i was imagining a you know people like
like arming to banding together and like squeezing their butt cheeks against the hole it's more like um
how can i
maintain that clarity and and that ability to
hold what's beautiful and not just you know domination and um enslavement
how can we make more bubbles in the manifold yes re-bubble eyes that's the primary thing right
as the manifold is collapsing reactivity just causes more rapid collapse um so we have to re-bubble eyes
so to speak which means produce new um
new features in the opportunity space and we've got to get the humans going from resistance rejection and
conflict forward innovation
innovation um insight relationship memory intelligence play all of these things right creativity and
right now there's nothing on the table there's literally literally nothing i mean there's little
bubbling things that bubble up here and there most of them get captured pretty quick burning man is
one example of such a bubble that is easily captured was captured
but yeah we've got to re-bubble eyes and we've got to get the humans aware of the opportunities of
re-bubbleization so to speak
so i have a question for you then
a lot of games and i in the sense i mean like actual games like board games
uh you know they're often competition based uh you know they're often competition based
that i play and they're also um
a lot of a lot of games that are produced are just variations on war
yeah like teams with different agendas different strategies capturing territory
by the way that's priming people for that being the only game in town but yeah i'm listening yeah
and so that that's concerning to me me too that's not what games should be and you and i have both
played and enjoyed i think at least a few games that were cooperative right where we come together
and my contributions and your contributions now even the war games are like that right if you know
say playing um halo pvp or whatever right they have this feature of my skill plus your skill equals
better skills so we form a pod and then we fight another pod but what we have to do is form pods to
fight the things that are oppressing us rather than just invented nonsense in virtual space
right and that's going to be super exciting if you give people a direct experience even one time
of i form a pod you form a pod we cooperate to overcome an actual real world world problem boom
everybody's going to want in on that they're going to there's nothing as addictive
as an actual effect in the world of human and and or you know organismal beings
so we can produce something much more effective and addictive than what we're being you know been
the forces that are decohering our human intelligence and communal you know nature
we can't get rid of the tech but we can redeploy it yeah i guess i'm getting a little lost in the weeds
because my point of bringing up that that sort of game theory war like strategy games that seem to
you know just come back over and over again with different variations yeah by the way just what's
amazing about that and please keep you know don't lose your train of thought but that's a perfect
example of a thrisp right it just keeps producing new forms of the same thrisp right each one that
grabs the nervous system a little more it ratchets its its grip on the nervous system a little more
tightly that's the whole goal so that that's self-replicating so hold that in one hand in the other
hand we're also um talking about like oh you know there is a group of people you know who are taking
advantage of these holes in people's understanding of their own consciousness and they are manipulating
them um somewhere in the lines of like testing to see how much it works and now also just kind of
like oh we have an agenda we're going to use this too right so they're doing gain of function research
on ways to manipulate humans and they can do that these days extremely cheaply and unimaginably quickly
go ahead and so you and i see that as a problem for sure and in the old in the old framework
we would say that that that makes them an enemy
can the idea of an enemy exist in the framework of wanting to produce more bubbles more cooperation
more beauty rather than resist compete fight brilliant question so this is the problem of the dream
assassin um because ordinarily what introduces not ordinarily very commonly what portends the
end of dreaming is the introduction of an enemy um and we should pay very careful attention
to the anciently evolved intelligences that are involved in our dreaming experience
in this way because they can teach us what to do instead in the same way that we can learn how to
overcome the influence of the dream assassin the collapses the dreams which isn't always the right idea by the
way um we can take cues from that learning and transfer them to excuse me our human experience
and situation in societies and with technology so yeah the important thing isn't to identify an enemy
right this is why when i was posing a figure about what humans can do together to get an experience of the opposite of combat
that's very compelling right the goal isn't an enemy it's a problem that we want to overcome together
right we want to take a situation that's causing harm and suffering and transfer that transform that into a situation
that results in new intelligence new opportunities an expansion of the opportunity space for the
people that were previously suffering and so forth and humans are very capable of this they do it all the
time just not doing it in an organized way yet or at least they're not doing it large scale in organized
so sorry i got a little i was listening but i was also um having a hard time following because i was also
thinking at the same time okay you know what happens yeah i do that too so i i lost you in in
instead of it being an enemy um instead of that dream assassin thing it's sort of happening yeah it's troubleshooting and transformation
okay right and so we're still identifying a problem yeah we're not treating it as an enemy we're transmuting
it into what more beauty like like no no wait let me let me say very clearly what we're doing so
we identify a problem that becomes an opportunity space for our own mutual relational development liberation
and joy right so we use the problem to climb the ladder of our developmental humanity
which is what we all were hoping for when we got born here
is it is a chance to experience ecstasy in this one and also ecstasis from the prison hearing systems
that are trapping and oppressing us and ratcheting down their grip on what it means to be human
if we fight those systems they just ratchet faster right because you're you're feeding it yeah
exactly i i really appreciate this conversation and i trust our ability to pick up where we left
off but eric uh someone is calling me that needs my help okay can i get back to you yeah absolutely
appreciate you we were talking about how vigilance ambiguity and prediction form a triangle
that underlies most human anxiety and if not all of it it's hard to foment anxiety without these three
pivots getting activated and vigilance isn't just about see about watching things vigilance also has to
do with being observed and um men and women uh historically and presently tend it's not a law it's a principle
to have different concerns about this though both of them are seers and both of them are observed
this is why we have the idea of flexing which is to you know make a display but traditionally
the symbol of the woman in front of the mirror
um points up the the feminine fascination with being the focus of observation uh and things like um
sports right traditionally uh point up the focus the the male
um aspect of being observed being observed performing excellent acts and so forth
effectively in the psyche the masculine aspect tends to want to see and the feminine aspect tends to want
to be seen of course there are there's very there's really complex stuff here because the feminine aspect
does not want to be seen in the ways it does not want to be seen
um and the masculine aspect tends to i don't actually know what the vulnerability there is
we're all vulnerable to negative observational
so what i was pointing out is in a situation where
someone's anxious about something and there's ambiguity
um for example i mean we can create an example everything that we're anxious about is ambiguous let's
say but the example i came up with was um i got a new cell phone and i can't connect it to the internet
and i've been trying for three days i've been on the phone with tech support they sent me two new sim
cards it's not working now i can't tell when so there's temporal ambiguity i can't tell when
or if the problem will ever be solved and there's also situational ambiguity right i need the phone
to connect to the internet it's i have to be able to do that so in some cases what happens
particularly in psychosis or schizophrenia or extreme anxiety is that the left hemisphere
will gladly this is what i discovered when i learned these principles by observing my own family members
under high stress um in many cases and the american election is an example of this in a situation of
high ambiguity oh fuck oh i gotta write this in my essay i just published wow yeah this is really
important in a situation of high ambiguity left hemispheric processes in human cognition will gladly
prefer to generate a crisis they will go for pure disaster because disaster is a role we know we know how
disaster works we know what our role is inside it we don't know how just being human and improvising works
and this is an important um this is an important pivot to introduce to the friend we were speaking about
earlier the the usefulness of improvisation and just being fully human in a situation where there's high
ambiguity and we feel at risk because normally what we will do is we will accept one of three rules
that are familiar to us because we know how they work and those rules are victim persecutor and rescuer
and those rules are very attractive because we're extremely familiar with how they how they are
structured how they function and what outcomes they produce so this is what's called the drama triangle
right victim persecutor rescuer and people can switch roles in in a dramatic situation the point i'm making
though is something really trippy which is that we will accept shitty rules because we're not comfortable with
improvising or expanding our humanity we're comfortable with what's familiar historically and habitually
emotionally psychologically relationally so people just reenact these rules over and over again instead of
allowing themselves to improvise especially if they feel threatened by the vigilance ambiguity prediction triangle
and it's it's important to encourage them to improvise that gives them a move where they don't have one
if they realize that they're reenacting a habitual role because it's familiar that can actually unlock
the cage for them does that make any sense oh yeah for sure so i'm going to say something even weirder
i realized when i discovered this problem with familiar roles that actors actually do something really trippy
they take a familiar structure that should be dead inside because it's just the repetition of
some trope right some um some role right i'm almost always that role is victim persecutor or rescuer
right hero it takes some familiar role and instead of just becoming the rote structure of the role they
come to life inside it they improvise inside the role thus demonstrating to us the key to the cage of
our own human foible of just the continual enactment of a role that's dead inside what do you think
so you're saying they breathe life into a trope that's been used over and over again how
they come to life inside one of the structured roles of victim persecutor or rescuer that ordinarily
is just a historical reenactment right they take a structured role and they improvise inside the lines
of that role thus making the role become inspired and alive vitalizing it so they're actually showing
us how to do that in our own lives and that's part of why we become fascinated with them even
though we don't know this usually it kind of goes back to our some previous conversation about how the
games we play are often domination war-based games yes at least you know video games and board games and
so then you look at movies and yeah that victim rescuer and persecutor is the story that's it's just over
and over and over again exactly and when we like you know when you called me initially i called you some
kind of a name and then you asked me what i was doing and then i said something completely ridiculous
that i would never do right and so we're even though it sounds like guys just doing the guy thing
together we're actually improvising within the we were actually improvising within the role for sure
and so when when guys like quote unquote talk to each other
um that's part of what they're doing is they're doing that thing that dogs do when they wrestle
except they're doing it mostly in language they're exchanging insults that if it were serious
would cause fights but since it's playful it it just it's like a bonding ritual
it's interesting because i listened to a story and if the story goes
darren and nate were taking a walk and they had a great time and they saw this beautiful thing and
they did this beautiful thing and they uh you know met a squirrel and it was sick and we helped it so
there's the rescuer you know victim trope um yada yada yada yada and it's basically just 30 hours of
good thing after good thing oh something bad thing happens oh okay here's the resolution good thing good
good thing like that's not the interesting story the the the thing that makes a million dollars in the
movie theater is tension all the way um ambiguity it's it's playing with that and by the way it wakes
up the vigilance of the viewer because and how does it do that it introduces negative ambiguity
right and then it causes them to start making predictions right and then and then that's the
game you can play with those predictions you can have plot twists yeah exactly the moment you know
there's a murder you're trying to figure out who did it right you're just scripted to do this
i used to go to movies with my dad when i was a kid and this would really fuck me up
we'd be like in scenes two of the movie he's like that guy killed that person i'm like what
like he had figured out the language of drama to a degree like his predictive capacities were astonishing
and he thought there was something metaphysical to this i only discovered this later after he died
actually he thought he had a system maybe he did but i mean if you're playing with the confines of like
movies and and art that that's a lot that it's hard to for me to feel safe projecting that out into real
life experiences not to say that the movies and art we make isn't a reflection of daily occurrences but
i think that movies and stuff is a lot more contained than the metaphysical nature of humans
it's true yeah no it's true because the movie's happening in a box literally right it's a literal
frame so most of reality is missing and within that frame it's not too hard to solve problems but all of
us get reads on humans and we do make predictions whether they're conscious or not about the person's
integrity their desirability their desirability as a relational partner all these things and one of the
things that um no i'm not going to say that so my my dad for example was extremely good at reading
opportunity spaces and also reading people
um he had a kind of natural flair and part of this is because he went from a place where the
ambiguity and complexity is extremely high and compressed i.e brooklyn new york it's california
right so immediately he's a big fish playing in a small pond
in in new york right the number of events per second the temporal compression the relational
compression is way higher in brooklyn than it is anywhere in california right it's just so so he went
from a position of really high compression where he learned his skills to a position of much lower
compression he had an advantage he definitely had an advantage from that and this is how new yorkers
tend to think when they come to california i mean i saw some lady i was in the line at the grocery
store up the street it's like i don't know eight people in line right this lady comes in and she's
gonna buy some batteries and she's uh she just gets she just goes to the second position the person right
after the the you know the person who's being checked out at the moment and i i looked at her and i said
are you from new york she's like how did you know
i was like because only somebody from new york would think that they could just you know because
she's like well my car's parked outside i i i got my blinkers on i i i gotta you know i'm like yeah
you're from new york she doesn't give a shit about the line she's just like these are a bunch of
californians i can just manipulate the out of this who's gonna stop me
so yeah compression matters and what you were saying about the film is true right it's a small box
there's a limited number of variables much more limited than actually than with actual humans
but my dad and other people like you and me if we want to and you know there's two different there's
sort of two major branches of this the first is altruistic opportunism which is something you and
i are both very highly focused on i think and the other is manipulative like selfish opportunism right and
so we can certainly expand the skills we would use in the triangle of vigilance ambiguity prediction
when we're watching a film we can transfer those skills to real life
you know it's interesting because that altruism um it's been an interesting ride you know
just kind of getting into that mindset of like i mean it ain't all about nathan um
um and realizing the the relationship between when i take risks i sacrifice my own security for the
well-being of others i'm often rewarded for that it becomes a very interesting dance of um
how much should i be intellectualizing altruism versus enacting it from a place that altruism
tends to pour out of like a wellspring which is the heart uh you know i use love as a north star
um people i i it's a personal word because when you tend to use love in most circles people think
they're talking about the same thing but they're often have vastly different relationships with that
word sure like all words right yeah exactly um and i find that when i use the intelligence of my body
and these emotions of giving you know care forgiveness um not martyrism but allowing myself to be seen
as undesirable things with the recognition that there are higher truths and more beauty to come from
those kind of positions i realize that i'm playing a game that um is constantly putting me in that
position of uncertainty it's constantly putting me in like a i have no idea i can't not predict what's
going to happen um when i give away resources to people that i may never see again or um decide
not to go make a bunch of money building bombs because i know that those bombs are going to
go kill people and it doesn't align with my altruistic values um i give up security for
you know the absence of something so
all that being said i'm rapidly becoming more and more comfortable with
it's very little but it was kind of kind of not being able to see past my nose but continuing
continuing to be met in life with beauty and with reciprocity it's it's very it's a fascinating
journey and i'm wondering what that stirs up in you okay so this goes back to
let's let's just be clear historically you were experimenting with your capacity to manipulate
situations is that not true
sure sure mostly unconsciously sure but i think often consciously too because you're you're in
extremely insightful and i see you as quite intelligent in the sense of the capacity to
understand variables and you know um do what's needed to get the result you want which could be
understood as cunning you're you're potentially cunning sure um and what happened for you i think
was that you underwent and you're still in the process you underwent a transformation
um in which you you started to realize wait there's there's like five other games i could play
and if i'm after rewards the kinds i can't expect easily are actually better than the ones i'm familiar
with right okay so and similar to me i i realized early on like the rewards i get from random acts of
altruistic experiment are much more satisfying than the ones that i get from manipulation even though i
too am capable of manipulation so we both switched over and here's the thing that happens we switch from
the mechanical in um the sorry is the siren bothering you no i can't hear it at all okay um we switched from
mechanical utilitarian evaluations of reward to risk right and part of how we switched was by going from
rote analysis and and mechanical manipulation of variables in the relation space and the opportunity
space to play this is what i was talking about earlier with the switch to improvisation from a familiar
role we don't know how it works we don't know what the outcome is we don't even know if we get a reward
right it's not merely the delayed reward experiment of you know you know can the monkey
sit in front of two bananas for three hours knowing that they're going to get five later or do they have
to eat the bananas right now it's not just that it's something much much more profound which is
to play sincerely to be authentic and vulnerable and alive and creative in a situation where other
people are tending to play in a more utilitarian sense
so we learn that we can discover new features of our humanity by improvising and taking the risk of moving
outside the familiar roles and outside our intellectual or opportunistic capacity to manipulate circumstances
now look if i'm relating with a corporation i don't give a about altruism that's not a human being
i want benefits right now yeah i think i make that mistake quite often
interesting that you called it a mistake say more
all right where do we leave off all right so we're talking about the switch from rote or analytical
utilitarian evaluation of role and reward to improvisation where the reward itself
doesn't become the goal what becomes the goal is something like relational integrity experiment play
improv right um and that's risky because we know how to manipulate things we're intelligent we're
insightful we can see some variables but what i was saying earlier is if i'm interacting with a corporation
i don't give a shit about altruism now if i'm interacting with a person in an organization i care
about that person but i want benefits because they're treating me like an object and you know as far
as i'm concerned there's no relational integrity there um and you were saying that you you used to make
that mistake you called it a mistake so i wanted to hear more about why you think that's a mistake
right so like i struggle with the to steal or not to steal i i see grocery stores as incredible evil
not like you know i'm not standing in front of it like flipping it off but like um there are people
starving and yet there's all this bounceable food just sitting here rotting being thrown out at the
end of the end of the day um and i don't respect the business i don't respect the institution that
it's born from and so you know if i can get away with spending less money there i will for sure um
then you know i have a moral crisis because i go oh you know i don't agree with stealing where do i draw
that line um am i making a mistake by viewing the corporation you know am i going to be punished in
some way like like what not by the law but by some like karmic order you know and i don't know how to
navigate that because it gets into the realm of um the mechanics of the universe that i don't understand
and what exactly divinity is and how you know how are the sets scales and balances balanced at the end
of the day like who who's keeping score right i don't know right neither do i but um
we can say something very primordial and fundamental about this um the first thing is you didn't invent
language so did you steal language from humans uh i wouldn't say so there's lots of things that you
didn't pay for that you received so what's the difference between things you receive that you don't
pay for and things you receive that you do pay for now i think you find that in relation i agree but
that's only if there's integrity in the relational manifold which there naturally is in small human
groups because of a reputation um but in broad scale groups that goes away what i was going to say that i
think is primordial is possess nothing do not take anything that is not yours ever
neither emotionally nor relationally nor commercially nor objectively possess nothing
care nothing care nothing for possessions care about beings adore beings give whatever is asked ask for as
little as possible that's a primordial guideline that we can probably trust but we live in a highly layered
representational environment where there's all kinds of misbehavior going on and so in that
environment we should have a layered i think it's intelligent since we live in this environment to have
a layered response um i don't know how to say this but i'll just be blunt i'm a thief
i've been stealing shit since i was a little kid
um i don't i i tend to respect the boundaries of personal ownership
as far as my my thieving goes i try not to steal from people but i don't give a part of me doesn't
give a fuck about stealing from organizations because i don't believe they're people
i mean that's what i'm navigating too and the primordial principle is always valid right
the thing i said first is the thing i actually know like i trust
and i can't sorry go ahead i can't obey it i feel very possessive about certain objects
it's one of my character flaws yeah i i don't feel possessive i don't have necessarily a desire to
own things but i don't i i'm like slowly eking myself towards understanding the fact that
i don't know if it's a fact but some there's some relationship with
being fed like given being and i mean that not just in a food way but like being given the things
that you need and and playing around with defining need and versus want like
like there's a story happening in all of our lives and people talk a lot about alignment you know with
destiny and with what they're here to do in this incarnation like like being in a body is a mission
in of itself and we're here to relate in a certain way and that's a very interesting a very very
interesting like idea to me i i spend a lot of time wondering and being curious about
this proposition that's been around for a long time of destiny and
this this incarnation being a very small part of a bigger picture in terms of like a soul
and so when that comes into play i go you know logically why would i be here on earth
if i how like like like is my job to collect the resources that are then necessary for me to do the
thing i was meant to do or is there is that an illusion and i'm going to be handed the things that i need
um and i realize i've collapsed the manifold quite a bit here um with a lot of
you know scenario with the scenario but it kind of gives an insight into what i'm exploring in all
this this altruism it's like oh when i let go when i trust that what will be what i need capital n need
i trust that that will be given to me um and everything else is kind of a distraction or an
illusion things start to move things start to shift around me and i start to become lighter and feel
freer because i don't worry so much about what i possess and i worry a lot more about my relationship
to people and to just about everything and that has only benefited me and yet i don't
even though i've been benefited i don't know if that's because it's a good strategy with a weird
lore written around it or if i'm tapping into some sort of you know universal truth about incarnation and
why we're here okay so yeah it does the word you used strategy right that implies the utilitarian
analysis of variables and situations so right it's not a strategy and this is the difference between
approaching relationships and situations analytically and the thing i was talking about earlier right
because the analytical rule is obviously selfish and opportunistic yeah it's about what do i get
and weirdly the altruistic role in my view in my felt sense is not about what do i get it's about who do i
become it's about role right and so improvising that role learning to be human in a situation where we are at risk
and resisting the urge to deal utilitarian in a utilitarian fashion that is you know quote pragmatic unquote
is part of the process of becoming human because we're not i think actually we are probably kind of born
human with all of our potential faculties in nascent form but what we're exposed to in human culture and
when we undergo inculturation and languaging that adds a layer that is very fucking confusing and painful to
relate with it doesn't make sense and so many of us respond to that and it's relatively natural to respond
to that opportunistically well if it's about like if it's about accounting then i'm going to get the stuff
right fuck those other people it's about me um much like i do not want to play the accounting game i really
don't yeah you're you're okay the accounting game let's be really clear the accounting game appears to be
useful in an accounting sense but it's the most expensive game you can play because you can live
your life and not have a moment of being human so that that game becomes more expensive every time we play it
we have to i guess i'm willing to completely relinquish that game altogether and put my full faith in
you know this invisible force
but i don't i i obviously haven't done that because on some level i don't really believe that it's there
i just know that i'm relating with something that seems like it's there does that make sense it does
but i can i think i can address that very effectively sure um like when when am i going to go too far
with this and then completely fall through here's the problem you're actually using your accountant
to try to try to make the determination of whether you should be free or not
here's here's what i mean you're trying to figure out whether there's some invisible force that will
reward you if you're authentic yeah okay and and here's the thing that's not part of the equation
whether or not there's an invisible force that's got your back you're still using the accountant to try
to be free of the accountant there doesn't have to be an invisible force the same thing can be true
with or without any invisible force all it depends on is authenticity in relation
and whether you're acting within the purview of your of the spirit of your being and the spirit of
your being doesn't have to be metaphysical
right so you established a false dichotomy yeah false dichotomy is this only works if there's an
invisible force that has my back
right because otherwise what i'm doing is suicide no it isn't that's the accountant talking it's got
to be well it's got to be either invisible force or you're just reckless and you're gonna die
that's not that's nothing like the game that is afoot my friend the game that is afoot has infinite bubbles
and so as you move in the bubble space it actually doesn't matter first of all your destiny
so to speak is not determined by some pre-existing set of rules it may be influenced by them possibly
but you've set up a false dichotomy where either there's an invisible force that's got my back
or i'm a dead man right that's not true you're a living man right now whether or not there's an
invisible force you're a being and you're not just a man you're a being right you're an organism you're
an animal you're a human all of these things and the big ones are huge right being is infinite organism
is pretty big animal is gigantic human is smaller person is very tiny in comparison
i just want to be really clear like your life's an adventure i think it's meant to be lived out of
a spirit of beauty and discovery and exploration and experiment and play if if your ability to play
has to depend on whether or not there's some invisible force that's got your back as long as you're
you know not just doing the accounting thing no no dude no that's not there's no part of that that
is real the invisible force may or may not be there either way if you play well you're going to be fine
and what you means is complex might not mean your human body right yeah and that that's that's something
that's interesting to me is like in that exploration i think the the life beyond death um you know
exploration has depended on that invisible force for me for a long time because i think okay
if this is really just a game of you know play and we somehow got confused with all this accounting stuff
then of course then there's going to be you know we're going to wake up from this dream after a
while and be like that was fun what's next um i think there's something really important to consider
here this is a toy i'm not saying that this is how it is but what if your actual life and the game
that you're actually playing which isn't entirely a game but we'll call it that what if your life and the
game that you're playing and the thing that i called your spirit that you're using you're learning to use to
navigate your experience with as you transform from an accountant to an improviser what if what is
inspiring that improvisation is actually your death what if your soul is the knowledge you have
beyond this lifetime attempting to influence your behavior within this lifetime what if afterlife isn't
the actually important thing what if the after death is actually your soul's intelligence
leaking back what if your life is your death leaking back into incarnation
yeah i mean i don't even know what the fuck they do with that yes you do you're brilliant you're
gonna have no problem with this you're gonna chew on this and you're gonna be like oh my god that's
fucking insane because i think honestly at this late phase of my life i've lived a long time for a human
i'm starting to see that we've got this whole thing with death backwards it's inside out our life is
actually inspired by our death in the future remember i told you that i was concerned that
there was an event in the future that was sending shockwaves back in time what if that's what our soul is
what if our soul is the position above all our lives and it leaks backwards in time into actual specific
existences it certainly makes you wonder why things are the way they are no it's it it actually explains
why the things are the thing are the way they are it really does because everybody's got it backwards
right they're playing the game from the wrong end of the board right they think i need to preserve this
this separate self and if i mess up it's going to be i'm going to get judged and it'll be destroyed
when in actually in actuality they have to think from death into life not from life into after death
your spirit is powerful i know you and i'm not i mean i'm stupid about simple things like every human is
but i can see the power of your spirit and that is incredible man it's like really momentous i'm not
trying to build you up or blow smoke up your ass i'm trying to encourage you to trust it
right you can i trust you i trust your heart and what i mean by your heart is this position above a single
life and you keep wondering if there's this force that will protect you man that's the force you're
made of you're made of this thing that's above your specific life and frankly there's nothing really to
lose but your integrity in the moment so when you go with your integrity in the moment it's win-win
it's it's bubble making you're making bubbles and you've seen this demonstrated to you it's been
demonstrated in conversations you and i have had directly for sure particularly the hilarious
metaphor of the sun cloud sun the sun cloud yeah right like but wait what the thing that blocks the
light what what are you are you kidding me oh god beautiful fantastic
yeah i i have a real deep my goal is deep presence within every moment and the understanding that i
don't need to plan the future i mean both things work it doesn't have to be one way or the other
bubbles bubble making involves lots of different kinds of bubbles but but yeah the to the degree
that you don't have to plan the future you're rich and to the degree you have to plan it you're poorer
and our society and our civilization is based on the inversion of that principle no it's all about
the future man you got to make the money put it in the bank yeah let's go
it's very true i feel that no i trust your soul and you know you're wondering if there's some force
and what i'm trying to say is something really weird but you're misusing the thing you're wondering
with because the thing you're wondering with is the force you don't believe in
the force that hasn't proved its existence to you yet
it's the very thing that you wonder about the existence of that with that is the thing you're
wondering about
dude you keep talking you're gonna enlighten me
i'm learning with you man you're you're shining the light of your curiosity and your existential
questions on my mind and then my mind just starts reflecting shit like some kind of water
yeah it's it's an actual thing our conversations are one of my favorite games that we play oh it's a
beautiful game every time man i'm all in um part two of having to leave you ten minutes is my
appointment i'm gonna go ahead and get myself a little buffer room so i'm not just walking into this
office with like existential thought stripping yeah yeah it's all good cool um it's been a pleasure as
always uh i will maintain our friendship now that i have a little more stability you know yeah i
appreciate that um do i have your permission to post the recordings for sure yeah excellent i want other
people to benefit yeah it's my altruistic drive yeah to uh too many more to your spirit that invisible
force that you've been wondering about
good stuff i love you you're amazing dude just keep being beautiful you got this you too you too
i'll see you in the next one all right peace peace
