this meeting is being recorded
andre so good to see you man um we've been we've been friends for i guess what a decade
something like that what do you think
coming up on it yes i have to track it back feels like even longer anyway however we measure time
right yeah it must have been longer because now when i think back it's got to be
it has to be before 2009 that you came to visit for the first time
it wouldn't be that far back has to be but you know yeah time time is a time is a very tricky
bit right given our many conversations on the topic so how it feels is definitely uh very
very different in terms of how time has flown we've had that in a few of our experiences as well
yes yes but in my set in my case there's a
uh which i'm not going to say specifically what it is but there's a there's an arbiter
that i can use to determine and one of them is that i was outside with you right which wasn't always
possible yeah we went for some nice walks yeah so that has to be pre-2009 there's no other way around
it yeah and here we are again yeah or here we are still however that's yeah so i'm here in san
francisco whereabouts are you
well i'm here in in bucharest for now so 10 hours away from you we're pretty much splitting the globe
and um is that place that you're in is it your home
is it a place you rent how long have you been there well it's the place um home is an interesting
topic for me uh it's the place that used to be home it's where i was born and raised till i was 20
when i uh left for california it belongs to me right now used to belong to my parents
um i no longer really call it home i mean we set up home in it as it were but home has become a much
different notion and and with a different felt sense to it so we kind of half jokingly half
seriously referred to it more as base camp than than home base so it is base camp for now where we
usually kind of fold up after like this year being away here and there in a number of different
locations and then pulling inwards for the winter season for a period of hibernation and incubation
that we usually try to do in a sort of at home retreat so for that it is home and base camp and
refuge and sanctuary and retreat space so this is the place in which you were raised this that's pretty
amazing man i mean some in terms some old iteration of me that is again i can hardly identify with that
this has been several characters back so looking back over it there's no really there's no emotional
or energetic threads felt to it it just feels like someone informing me of of some previous iteration and
there's no sense of nostalgia or funness or things popping up whatsoever but locationally geographically
and everything else that's that's the place that's very interesting everything you said there i think um
your detachment from it points i mean i don't know exactly what it points to but in
the way that i hear it and what i make of it is that you've um you've sort of cleansed out your
interiority of the historical iterations of who you are so that uh those tap those attachments just aren't
there aptly put well spotted and aptly put it's actually been a deliberate process that if i were to
trace its earliest uh seeds not even roots this was prior to root is what um in the tradition that
castaneda was purporting to transmit they used to refer to as recapitulation which is a process of
methodically revisiting one's uh life frame and essentially extracting by way of of of presence and and
and uh reinserting presence into the episodes uh extracting the energy that was still stuck in any
episodes that might bring up an emotional um zing let's say of any kind of any kind so essentially
like sucking the energy back into the into the presence and then in conjunction without a process of
also dating back to them as a notion um erasing personal history went through several episodes of
that the name change is part of that aspect some some layers of sitting and deleting uh all of my
photos up to a certain point that was a few years ago so there have been many such layers of
in erasure and letting go erasure and letting go and that too is part of what allows me to be in this
place and essentially it's like a familiar new place as it were wow yeah so i first encountered castaneda
in probably around 90 i guess it'd be eight um had heard of him had no exposure to those traditions
uh
friend my girlfriend's roommate had a few books sitting on the shelf and i just picked up the
first one started reading it and um i was immediately deeply impressed there's something
very strange about that book and as somebody who like you were both uh bibliophiles to put it mildly
i'm not to put it yeah i'm gonna be asking you some questions about that but um this thing blew me out of
the water uh i became very immediately fascinated with it i eventually did some experiments with recapitulation
um
one thing that's clear to me however which is sort of weird is that when i was 17 and living in stockton
we received in the mail a flyer from the local scientology branch and they have what they call a
personality test which is like a series of about i don't know 80 questions just check boxes right
and if you fill it in they offer you this thing which they call a free communications course
and so i was introduced to scientology through that i went in for the communications course
um a lot of what that was was learning how to sit with someone right in your face
attempting to get a reaction out of you and just being like dead
right non-reactive no matter what they did but they taught us about this thing that they call auditing
which uses a device they call an e-meter which is essentially um two metal probes that you hold
your hands wire to device with a sort of read out on it and they say different words or bring up names
you sort of give them the um you give them the the information they might need to figure out
what what might trigger you and the idea of being clear in scientology is to be
the similar to the idea of having fully recapitulated um your history and also erased your personal
history very similar concepts which i find interesting i don't know if you were aware of
any of that have you had any exposure to scientology at all no that's news to me sounds very interesting
though i was almost curious like okay i'd like to get my hands on those literally speaking see what
that's right see what that brings yeah i'm pretty sure you could get an e-meter uh i don't think i'm
pretty sure there's plans for them you can buy um for scientology is a straight-up cult but i mean i
would argue that uh well i wouldn't argue i would suggest that um uh the castanaden tradition was also
pretty culty um particularly the inner circle with the girls uh kylie and taisha and um uh the blue scout
whose bones were found at panamint dunes shortly after uh castanada passed away
um all the women disappeared nobody knows where they are um we don't know if they're alive or dead
at least one of them is dead um of course they had already undergone a kind of similar process right
of complete obliteration of persona personality um i actually have a letter from taisha somewhere i wrote
to her and she wrote me back she didn't say much she gave me some suggestions about what i might do
to prepare for studying path and mostly it was just like um be impeccable which is an interesting idea
because i think it's the language is relative relatively confused and also to study martial
arts particularly um tai chi or kung fu which i ended up you know pursuing tai chi
um but yeah i haven't done anything similar to what you're talking about i've experimented with
recapitulation i also have a couple of friends who study shamanic uh existing shamanic traditions
um one of them belongs to a group called the maker shamans and they are hugely they teach
recapitulation they are a tradition that traces its roots back to europe in the sort of the pre-witch hunt
stuff and they are not in any way associated with castaneda and they're but the idea of recapitulation
that they teach is essentially the same thing some other other techniques i'm curious what led you how
did you discover um how did you discover this particular practice and what inspired you to pursue it
well it's not a linear answer i would give castaneda was one of the early seeds
uh in my early years when i was a teen that set me um that got me going that set me on the not on the
path as much as seeking a path um found it shortly after actually after not too long joining a fourth way
group that is actually how i ended up in california in the end and part of a cult in my own turn would
serve me well for a good decade of very very solid practice but initially thinking back now that i was
talking to you i think it was essentially a handful of different flavors in my teen years that
that kind of accreted on a very eclectic eclectic magnetic center as good gf would called it that
started orienting my compass needle as it were and it was taoism and yoga and osho and castaneda essentially
those were the main the main pillars um there were also martial arts but um they were some of the hindu
practices and the upanishads but they are they all kind of affiliated to one or the other of these
these being sufficiently distinct now i didn't go through castaneda in depth actually i concentrated
mostly on his dream work back in the day and uh was was fascinated with lucid dreaming which i managed
to achieve then and then lost the capacity for many years afterwards and the recapitulation essentially
i remembered about the process much later on essentially as i was in in fully embarked on it
and doing it without having the nomenclature or the concept and it just popped back up it's hey by the
way we know this already or that's what the toltex called recapitulation in his in his tradition so i
can't even say that i studied it as much as the concept came back at the time in my life when i was
deeply involved with this combined process of recapitulation and erasing of personal history
it was during a time of a solitary uh silent retreat that i took on a faraway land uh for months just
alone and unplugged and with everything turned off and basically hard to reach unless you came not
knocking on my door and this was part of that of that process it started earlier with the ramp and
it had a tail afterwards as well and a mopping mopping up part if i can call it this way and um it's part
of a larger process i would say of of dissolution or at least the allowing of a disintegration of a sense of
self um i think initially it was a lot more voluntary and deliberate and hammering at it and going at
it a number of different ways in accordance with the practices and traditions i had trained and and
exerted myself in and at some point it just snowballed into something that it's had its own momentum so
my job remained to just you know stay breathing keep my head above the water as the process just hurled
itself at breakneck speed but almost literally so to speak um and just allow it to take place
so that's where it fit in so it was less of a castaneda thing as much as a throwback and realizing
okay that's what they meant by it but discovering it in motion as something was happening and giving
it a name from an already familiar index if i can put it this way beautiful but that's all very clear um
what were your original motivations in pursuing these
skills
these paths and how did they transform over time
right
that is uh plenty different questions in one to answer there
uh well it's on on one level it's it's let's say simple but not easy to answer the simple part is
that the original motivation which remains alive all throughout just changed in comprehension was waking up
was a drive to wake up uh stemming from a deep unease a sort of restlessness and unease um at the
nagging feeling that what i'm actually perceiving and interacting with the world around me
my inner scape outer scape are not what they seem and in the more let's say extreme
form or extreme states in terms of how it's registered um even even i could use the word fake
that that that i'm looking at the fake scenario of fake screenplay a fake character
um it was only much later on that i ran across um the move this movie that i'm sure you know called the
truman show with jim carrey and it's a bit like that on on a more let's say
course level still the same kind of reality but otherwise earlier on it was more uh an intuitive
sense and a nagging sense of the experience of neo in the matrix of of feeling like this is not it
this this this is really not it uh and like feeling that i'm under a deep spell a sort of trance
gurdjieff called it uh a sort of auto hypnosis that we're under and living in sleep
and and then just doing my damnedest that i could to to snap out of it to to wake up from it not even
really knowing what that means just knowing that i can't have this continue essentially
like this this is not it so it was more of a process of purging that this is not it
than the pursuit of a this is it like hell what would i know what could i know in that regards is
but it was more a matter of no not not this i'm this is not it this is still not it um and how it
evolved over time it just became a lot more i guess systematic from being rather haphazard and
uh you know crapshoot and hidden miss and uh eclectic and disorganized and unstructured and
undisciplined to being very methodical and then later on i could even use use the word ruthless
quite quite terminatory to some extent and that's been terminal to a number of relations in my life and
to many different aspects of my life in several different waves and then in time it became after
some of these highest waves a bit more gentle as a process not as driven not as uh militaristic not
as act not as militant not as activistic as it was uh not as rushed not as forced not as pushed a bit
more taoist if i can use this as an epithet for it but continuing all the same and the methodologies
changed and i got exposed to more and more people and traditions that have been doing these things
for far longer and with much higher capacity and competence than i had exposure to wow up to those points
so this is very sensible to me everything you share here um i recall in the castaneda books uh some
some scenes one in particular stands out um and my memory of it is probably blurry but uh
uh carlos is at some kind of a farm with don juan and one of his friends and he's having some kind of
trouble with a car and don juan and his friends are laughing a lot they think this is hilarious
and he's trying to get the car to like to run properly or something like this and he gets stuck
on a dirt road and don juan and his friend are just losing their they're just like belly laughing
and crying and carlos gets very angry at one point and says you know what why is this funny i'm trying to
get this car to work and don juan sort of he still can barely talk he's laughing so hard and he says
carlos your car is not here this entire time you have been interacting with your hat there's no call
carlos and you know this is the kind of a sense of the problem and how um deeply profoundly weird and
confusing it is because we are trained and we learn to take our
our
our delusion of our perception and the world
as concrete and factual and true right yeah and i recently was thinking about this i mean there's so
much i want to explore here with you about this but um i was recently thinking about this and i you
know i have similar concerns but i've been much less um
i've been much less effective and much less disciplined than you vastly less i'm sure um but
i have similar concerns and interests and such though i'm mostly asleep to be honest i mean i wake up in
certain ways when i'm with someone who's sharp but most of the time i'm a zombie just like everybody
else i think um but one of the mistakes i think we make is uh and we're trained to make it is is that
this thing here so a bottle of rubbing alcohol you know it's very solid it's very reliable um to my
senses it's quite continuous in time it's not likely to be moved around by itself like if i set it down
you know somewhere it's gonna probably be there when i come back or you know those objects over there
that door um this computer these things they have a kind of reliable uh continuity in time and form
and i think that there's like you could call them layers or registers of existence and and i think
one of the mistakes we make is we transfer the expectation of continuity of form function position
um stability over time we we transfer that from the layer in which it's relatively reliable
to all to all other things so think that all things are like this including me and her and them and all
the things we think about we transfer this that creates a huge array of mirrored illusions that are wrong
that one new it's a fundamental error
right right right that that extrapolation that you're that you're talking about which moves from
what is is essentially as you're holding up the bottle it's it's an it's uh it's an assembly of of
sensory perception uh perceptions really there are a number of senses involved that decode that in a
certain way and everything else on top of that is invented is our way of of uh is a second hand you
know pun not intended you're holding that in your in your hands like no other second hand involved the
second hand is is the mind but everything from there on is is second hand what you don't have
you know what's not in your in your hand how we create the notion of bottle and the notion of alcohol
and associate that with certain information uh stored in our registers uh perhaps memories um
the color white uh with the bottle was where it came from how much it cost
a lot of additional layers whereas if you're to hand the same bottle to a a young child or newborn
someone coming from a culture that has no rapport like we do with the objects or at least those objects
that are so familiar to us and have no idea what that is and what to do with it and how to treat it
uh a senile elderly person or things like that or someone who's in a trance they would not have the
same rapport with that with that object um so the fact that we solidify we consolidate some of these
perceptions into concepts that then we give names that are then attached to words that are furthermore
sometimes written down in symbols we essentially function across four or five different layers of
of approximation of of denomination are experienced instead of being in in our direct experience where
bottles come and go and so do dream catchers and mandalas and doors and things hanging on them and
the colors you're wearing and none of it really has names and especially not ourselves and even the
notion of self has emerged like a sort of personality equivalent on a human level of a bottle that we
take with the same kind of consistency and solidity out of that process of extrapolation that you were
talking about is that bottle of of rubbing alcohol and to dismantle this uh this edifice is is hella tricky
because everything around us pulls us back into re-establishing these patterns of of perceiving of
communicating what we're perceiving of relating to ours our experience one another the world through these frames
so it's almost schizophrenic to actually be awake behind all of these you know layers of deception
while at the same time playing the game and naming names and talking talk and using rubbing alcohol without
getting anybody harmed
so i'm actually having an unusual experience at the moment and it could have to do with the um
so there's different ways to talk about it i sometimes use the phrase the third mind to indicate
the space we forge together that is neither me nor you right and that comes together according to why
we are together and how um but i'm having the experience of
uh a light a light degree but a but a present one of relief
of my sleep so that i'm starting to not know what the things are around me
i can feel that i don't know what they are and that's great this is very uncommon for me um
it could also have to do with something uh of the power of your focused awareness and attention
um and our agreement you know to come together and look and see and so forth but yeah it's really
interesting because i know a large number of i am aware of many people and i know a few
who have been very interested in the idea of lucid dream
and i've learned quite a bit of unusual things about that that i don't think are commonly understood
by the people who practice it but i'm not sure because
you know we may make projections about what the world or other people are like or what they know
or don't know but ordinarily for most of us and i'll certainly for me um the actual slice of
the world with which i have any intimacy is extremely thin
right the slice of which i have some actual direct contact if i'm thinking about what other
people are doing i'm just making up i have no contact with other people right i'm going by
my evaluation of the field of information that i receive from outside and the media and so forth
and by the way this is another way of just going right the to sleep i mean completely gone
right we think that like what you're reading and the news and blah blah blah whatever the
media you're exposed to is tick tock who knows what right that's giving you some perspective of
what the world is or what's going on or what other people think or what they're doing or any of that
it's not entirely untrue but the degree in the way in which it's true or nothing like the degree in
the way in which they tend it tends to affect our um perspective and sort of put us to sleep but uh
yes so one of the things that i would say is that in dreaming which let's be really let me try to be
clear about a few things very briefly without going into a lecture um
um the dreaming mind's way of being an experience if i can use this phrase the dreaming mind to the
aspect it's very different from what we experience while we're awake and we're not necessarily inclined
to understand that because we interpret our memories of dreaming with our waking mind
which in a way would be like asking a man about the experience of having a uterus
right go ahead that's the guy sure yeah um so interpreting our dreaming experience with our waking mind
mind is going to wrong foot us and what i think would be actually a lot more fascinating it would
be that if we could somehow inquire of our dreaming mind about what it makes of that stuff that happens
over here in the waking world that would be trippy right um and i think the dreaming mind is actually
very concerned and curious about what happens post apocalypse because the dreaming mind dies every
morning the whole world of the dream it just comes to a fucking end right and the dreaming mind is aware
that there's something on the other side of that apocalypse um and i would i would suggest that certain
features of it survive that apocalypse but they are profoundly inhibited most
of the time during our waking experience and one of the things that was happening a few
moments ago when i was starting to lose my grip on what stuff is is that i was starting to have
more like the sense of dreaming um i'll try and say a few other things briefly and then get back to
some interesting questions and feel free to ask any of your own um so lucidity first of all there's a
bunch there's a whole continuum of modes of dreaming it's not just one thing oh you're dreaming or you're
not you can think of it in that simple term it's not going to help you much there's a whole continuum
of modes all different kinds so simple example would be um if you happen to be dreaming that you are in
the room you are sleeping in at that moment while you are dreaming it's not the same thing as a as a regular
dream right um if you're having a dream say again yeah yeah i agree different class if you're if
you're messing about with um light fixtures in the dream not the same thing as a regular thing trying to
turn on a light or something like that it's not a regular situation um as if there are regular situations
but so there's a whole bunch of different modes of dreaming and forms of dreaming that i think is
important to understand so we don't just think like you're either dreaming or you're not which is you know
true but sort of trivial and then there's a variety of degrees of lucidity um clearly and if you're
dreaming that you're in the room that you're sleeping in you're probably on the verge of light lucidity
and if you're messing around with light fixtures generally there might be some exceptions where
this isn't true you're also you're sort of you're entering the liminal space between the two minds
if there are two right if there's a dreaming mind and a waking mind for the sake of convenience
you know simple language yeah yeah you're starting to enter that liminal space and that liminal space
is where there's sort of a three-way branch right you either kind of return to dreaming and often
the dream will backfill because you'll have some kind of a question a sort of a question will arise
like why well i'm turning the light switch on the lights not going on what's what's happening so i go in
in you know an actual situation i experienced i go get a flashlight turn that off doesn't go on like
okay the light switch not being on that could be the electricity out but the flashlight not working
that can't be the electricity out to have some kind of a question about the dream situation
and this is the weird thing about dreaming
um explicit features of identity or situation or language these are anathema to training these end
right right um and so anyway you have this branch a lot of the time what will happen is the dream will
backfill it'll give you a sort of plausible explanation for what's going on so you can just keep dreaming
or yeah they have every technical term in dreaming they refer to that as confabulation yes yes perfect
great great i love it the dream makes up the story as well of course i mean the lights have never
worked i mean what were you expecting where did you even get this idea in the first place you're
expecting stuff to come out of these objects here that doesn't happen yeah why were you thinking this
yeah or even um yesterday was your birthday and you blew the candles out and they're still out
so the dream mind is great at this confabulation or backfilling um and what i would argue is that
actually what the waking mind is doing all the time that results in our delusional sleep
is the same kind of thing but very explicitly right of course that cup was there on the table yesterday
right darren was born in 1960x on day x of month y right and he's lived every day ever since then
right this is his face these are his clothes of course right not only that my son takes these things
as being like self-evident and and set in stone and then we no longer question our experience our
perception and so on because of course yeah this is my cup and it's the desk and this is me and these
are my fake eyebrows and i feel like doing this since i know myself brings up some strange black mirror
episodes now that we're talking about it where you know if you ask yourself this kind of question you
start wandering into that territory of like you know where was i prior to this episode and can i be really
so sure this was one of my triggers back in the day in terms of the reality checks within dreams
so-called reality checks it's kind of a funny name right to to use it like that uh it's all it's almost
presumptuous to put it like that because the dream you see doesn't have a reality we're doing reality
checks and dreams as if this is the reality so we're just doing you know the testing as per this
mode of perception in the dream to validate it but anyway we'll use that phrase so we don't have to
reinvent the wheel but um it was to backtrack and see if i can remember where this all started like
where was i here okay i was i was in the hallway before coming in here okay and prior to the hallway
what's the interest of this building and prior to that prior to that i mean prior to that
uh and then all of a sudden that can that can flip a switch there you know when any cuts and say wait
a minute all right i might be dreaming you know sometimes it's a light switch this was one of the
technical uh advices for for checking for reality checking was to flip a light switch yes this was one
of the the common ones another one was to jump and this has never really worked for me the confabulation
was too strong on this one for example but there were a few others that that worked and this back
tracking was was one of them to see if i can remember all the way all the way back
okay we're we're into some heavy stuff that i that i think is amazing and i'm loving it um
um so uh one of the things i'll mention this guy sergey amagolan he uh i saw an interview with him on
youtube accidentally i just stumbled into it i think i was i was probably blundering around looking for
some castanet and stuff one evening and i came across this interview um with an older uh jewish guy
interviewing this fairly you know like 30 something hispanic man and the guy was talking about um
pull tech uh practices and stuff and um
he talked about his training uh in mexico city and around there and the use of mirrors to like to
literally erase to use a mirror and erase while you're awake erase you so that when you look in
the mirror you do not see yourself there's nothing there and one of the things that he spoke of was
if you should find yourself in a situation where you're partially lucid and you have some volition
in the dreaming um one of the best things you can do one of the most powerful things you can do
is to simply turn your perspective around so that instead of looking out from your body into the
world you're looking into your body forever and he would say he said um you know if you do this you
will find there's nothing there then you will have liberty then you'll be free and weirdly totally
unexpectedly um about some few nights later i fall asleep and boom i find myself on the roof of my
house night sky was there and i realized like dreaming i try to turn my perspective around and
i can't so i do the thing he said to do if you can just look in your hands and one of the things i
remember is that my hands were a little bit blurry but the thumbs were on the inside
and the moment that i saw that my hands i just became flying it's not like darren was flying like
superman darren was gone i was just the experience flight and then you know i went off and had some
adventures which i won't hear elucidate because they're somewhat explicit and then i went somewhere
else and did something very sort of darren-esque which is um commit to the protection of someone
and this happened twice and the same thing happened both times a flight some animal stuff happening and
then i go and say like i'm going to protect this person that i find um and about i don't know some some
period of time later perhaps a month or two i was i was on a uh call with a close friend from britain
and um she said oh oh my friend my friend alan's calling do you mind if we just include him in the
call it's like yeah sure let's do it so we're talking they're talking i suddenly realize
this is the guy who was interviewing sergio magone her friend is that guy which i find very weird so
i tell him what happened the story and everything i've done some interviews with him he's an interesting
cat he's um in his 70s now he's interviewed probably 3 000 people in the like uh shamanism paranormal ufo
abductees he knows whitby strever and you know he sort of knows everybody a very interesting cat
in any case my point was before i lose it because i'm i'm you know i'm telling i'm telling personal
history stories right i've become deluded i've become deluded while we're here talking about trying to
wake up um it strikes me that lucidity involves the gentle intrusion of certain faculties of waking
consciousness into the dreaming context right which i can think of as like a sort of um manifold of
bubbles will and so if something comes in sort of gently and intrudes gently it doesn't cause the
bubbles to collapse right they can keep bubbling right they keep breathing and bubbling but if it comes
in sort of at a more acute angle it tends to burst that right so you wake up yeah and
there's a whole bunch of stuff here i could blather on about that is fascinating to me but i won't
about synchronization between metabolic rhythms circadian rhythms and oneric rhythms which are
dreaming rhythms and these rhythms are very complex and there are certain modes of desynchronization
that are likely to result in lucidity and other modes that result in the collapse of the manifold when you
wake up and other modes that sort of go toward lucidity but then dissolve right back into more or less
regular dreaming if there is even is such a thing as regular dreaming but one of the things i find
fascinating is that none of the people i haven't heard a single person really um who i'm sure there are
some who are interested in lucid dreaming wonder about its opposite
what would opposite meaning taking taking dreaming into what we call the waking states not not remaining
in the dream territory right yeah right like the subtle in the gentle intrusion of dream of the dreaming
intelligences or forms of awareness or consciousness in the waking state without collapsing it into pure
dreaming um necessarily i was talking recently with uh sarah james i have an interview i did with her about
a week ago that's so amazing um she is someone who uh studies and teaches uh dreaming techniques from ancient
greece and does dream incubation with groups and stuff like this and what a brilliant what a brilliant
soul she is i just want to sing her praises for a moment uh
uh and she was talking about succeeding at something like this um succeeding at dreaming while awake
without the use for example of intoxicants and so on and how it became see this is what i really wonder
what would our dreaming experience what would our dreaming senses and faculties make of a world that
doesn't transform when you look at it more closely because i think the dreaming whatever's going on with
form and identity in dreaming and also with time and relationship it's very different from what's going
on over here usually it seems yeah what do you make of all these things i would ask a question share
whatever's on your mind i'd love to hear well the way you you pose you you posited the perspective
so first off in terms of references um love what you said about sarah jane if that's her name
it uh reminded me of something i've been reading recently um about the process you're referencing
which i am not knowledgeable of this is just things that i've come across from peter kingsley's books
who talks about the process of incubation used by the pre-socratics we call them pre-socratics and you
know like before before christ era sort of thing but they're the roots of western civilization
and the oracular tradition and the priests of apollo and the incubatory processes that were central to
their healing traditions and uh and even farther roots uh dating back through pythagoras and the eastern
roots from mongolia and central asia and and the shamanic tradition which we can actually appropriately
call shamanic because it came from the the area that shamanism is properly called shamanism we're talking
central asia and siberia and uh that part north northeast eastern asia and um in a way the word that comes
to mind of what you're describing which is a word that uh we invented i think it's not an extraordinary
thing for someone operating within those cultural um mind frames is is trance is is shamanic trance
the equivalent of what you're describing as the intrusion the infiltration the release maybe of
the dreaming mind into the our so-called um waking state would be would be the shamanic trance it's
in one of the books i'm reading right now you might know the author his name is arnold mendel
he draws heavily from the traditions pointing to castaneda and then shamanic traditions as well and
process work and group process work and he speaks about this notion of dreaming body
and and operating and relating to our experience our perception with the dreaming body not just the
rational mind and this dreaming body and he used the word body because it actually uses the body a lot it
uses the same perceptual faculties that otherwise the analytical mind is is uh operating from as well
but in different ways and i think what happens when you're describing you know what would the dreaming
mind make of this more fixed reality is that this is one of the things that changes as this intrusion is
allowed to take place um and it's the same as the reality of an oracle being in their trance this
reality is no longer fixed for them in a state that is not uh associated with sleep with and with
that's part of the circadian rhythms that mean night and rest and digest and the vegetative
eyes closed brain enter certain modes of functioning that we call sleep and yet the reality may appear
just as fluid just as liquefied just as amorphous in a way uh as within the dream state within within the
context within the so-called waking context so it loses its its sense of permanency it loses its fixity to
some extent or if it or if there is some fixedness to it it's going to be weird to put it this way even
that that fixity is fluid it's just a fixture is an element out of many it's like ah okay part of the
fluidity right now is that this thing is is stuck is stiff is is fixed but it's no longer a defining quality
which is the given for us our default relating to our experience is this fixity is this rigidity
is this constant identifying of patterns and naming and concepts and things like that whereas
there is just one of the things there may be some fixity too but it kind of comes and goes
and it washes out and it's a lot more fluid and in the process of of waking up actually
this continuum that you're talking about becomes a lot more on one sense continuous across the threshold
of these largely divided states of waking sleeping and dreaming it's it's not just no this is the set
a spectrum of waking states and this is the spectrum of dreaming states and these are the
weird liminal spaces and the transitional chaotic hypnagogic and hypnopompic you know inflection points
between cycles of either one or the other the whole thing becomes a lot more interlinked
and the colors bleed into one another so to speak because the locus of identity retracts from the fixity of
perception that we identify with further further back to where all of a sudden the large the larger
landscape is being being perceived so i'm not there yet to be able to make this statement in all honesty
as as my dwelling experience but essentially everything may come across as dreamlike
at some point have an equal quality of un of of unsolidity of of unrealness of uh let's say an empty quality
now we no longer colonize with concepts with words with names that we no longer taint with attempting to
communicate you know or bastardize by trying to fix it into shapes to put into boxes so we can identify and do something with
it remains much like a child's experience
total and undivided in a way just pure colors just pure physical sensations just pure auditory vibration
sounds now just pure flavors tastes and a bunch of other undefined senses that we don't ascribe to the
main categories in in that sense of orientation and spatial qualities and you know what's what's it like
being a bat or a dolphin or a snake we have a lot more senses than the the five usually ascribed in in a way
and all of these they become no longer divided in that in that state in that space because there's no
longer a need to carve off slices that get assigned the concept that gets assigned the name that gets
assigned symbols to represent it on you know pieces of paper or screens and become part of how we transfer
this knowledge we're much more immediate we're not even skin to skin with reality you're we're behind the skin
you know we're within the skin of of reality no longer separate from this
it's very beautiful to hear you speak this way because
it's one of the first experiences i've had
of having the experience of what is being described while it's being described
and i'm not sure why that's happening but it's happening for me a bit
ordinarily my intellect
is pervasive and it's it's fun it's skillful my intellect is skillful i enjoy it i know i know yes
it's like having a really nice sports car or some kind of acrobatic device or something right it has
freedom it has freedom but this is different this is like it's like what we're talking about i'm gently
lucidly waking right now um
while you were speaking
i began to imagine
that our waking consciousness often
when we're trapped in it it often operates like a kind of a fixture
or a faucet head
that
there's some kind of flow between the appearance of inside and outside right just the sort of strange
they're both emanating from the same thing right and they're both dying into the same thing so
they're both like originating at the same thing and then looking at each other and then dying into the
same thing at this you know this is all happening right but in waking consciousness there's a fixture
that dominates this flow and forces it into familiar shapes and functions you can imagine the
difference between a faucet head where there's just like one flow of the water coming out
and a faucet head that splits it into all these little flows right i have one actually like this
right because it it washes things better if there's many little streams and so it strikes me that waking
consciousness doing something like this it's splitting into familiar shapes
the relational flow between inside outside origin and and and um
whatever we want to call the disappearance and point the dissolution point i know but it's something
like origin is such a great word but i don't have the word for this maybe it's death
and actually yeah you might have these what's the opposite of origin right what's the antonym yeah
right machine
but it might be the death and origin of the same thing
right like like there's a there's a circle here right behind the scene and at the top it looks like
origin and we can put them either way right i've also recently started wondering whether or not perhaps
we're i've mentioned this before in a couple of videos but perhaps we're very confused about death
and that all of our motivation and affinity and disaffinity and what we call our intuition and even
our dreaming our desire for another or our revulsion or disgust for something all of these are leaking backwards
into our life from our death right not from before
as we usually think we usually think of like oh i got all that stuff previously i'm just carrying it along
with me in this you know incarnation but what if we have that back what if it's all from after our lives
and it's like leaking backward into time right and our affinities and desires and motivations and all
of these things they actually come from death from our from beyond this life but see this is now we're
getting into a whole bunch of other problems because you were talking earlier about attempting to
to use the attempt to to trace back a linear history in dreaming right to achieve lucidity as a method for
becoming lucid right you find yourself away if i understood you is did i get that right yeah yes yes
and so this is the weird thing about being awake and my son he said
he said which i thought was brilliant and actually kind of blew my mind
um he said he's become a monk by the way he's at an ashram in southern kyle um he said you know
remember dad how you told me that sometimes in dreams when you have i actually have a word for
when there's a crisis and you have a question i call it a granch right which is like a three-way
branch either back fills or and you keep dreaming or you wake up or the gentle intrusion of the waking
consciousness comes and you become lucid to some degree right so he said dad remember when you're
telling me about how dreams backfill right they can just make up any explanation for how you got
into a medieval castle being chased by a three-inch tall pink tyrannosaurus and it can be like yeah you
know you were playing with dinosaurs four days ago and that one just started it got really mad at you
and yeah whatever it just makes up and i was like yeah he said well why don't you why do you not
think that that's the same thing your waking mind what if it's just so much better at it that
how would you know how would you ever find out if what if you didn't exist yesterday what if there
is no yesterday what if you weren't born what if there's no world right how would you tell
right and i was like oh yeah that's why yeah that's why me and your mom got together
and reduce this kind of a kid so ask this thing yeah that's that stuff's crazy so i think it's really
important um you see we are trained especially men and women less so but they have their own modes
and of course there's no um purely gender syncretic you know purely gender idiosyncratic thing there's
no such thing as that on the other hand there are um tendencies right we might we might identify and
this is pattern matching i get it you know i'm playing the game here but um
we are trained as men if someone comes to us and says you know blah blah blah blah blah
if we can determine especially if it's our girlfriend or something if we can determine
immediately that it's not true what they're saying isn't true then we just dismiss that
shit flush the toilet right a lot of us we're trying to dismiss things that we can immediately
determine are not true and yet weirdly most of our capacity for insight and for discovery um and for
wisdom and for awareness deepening awareness and waking up they do not depend on truth they depend on
something like
novelty useful novelty of an as if construct
my son wasn't saying dad you don't exist you weren't born you know there is no yesterday he's not
saying that he's saying something like what if how useful might it be for you to entertain that
perspective what could you gain perspectively by playing that way for a moment
this this can get things very complicated and very tricky and we can get lost in the maze of mirrors
when it comes to this because essentially the discourse on that level that's why when you met
you brought the question up earlier i thought well that is brilliant because you know that's a that's
a dynamite question it's it's one of those razor questions that if you if you wear it close and and use it
consistently this is more you know powerful than occam's razor for one who's on the path
like what would it mean to ask yourself that question to the point of obsessiveness to to
show such a deep distrust of your own perceptual capacities mental processes to challenge everything
you believe everything you see everything you hear the way information and knowledge is organized in your
in your head and and do that continuously or maybe if not continuously steadily regularly enough often
to begin with you know seldom but then we're not used to up to maintaining this level of effort
and then more often more often with a degree of regularity more regularity with some stretches of
continuity more continuity to where this becomes a continuous process where everything is being hammered
by this underlay under layer of essentially distrust i mean you're going to use the word distrust because
it's stronger than the one i'm going to use now which is one of the three pillars of zen they speak of
of great faith great doubt and great determination you know the faith is really what keeps me going
in the end the determination is the actual keeping going is the continuity i was speaking about
and and and and the what of the keeping going is this constant scissoring and razoring with this
doubt with this distrust what's it really like what's it really like what's it really like
now the moment this remains an as if instead of it becoming uh an existential question the more if we relate to it as
an as an epistemological question what if this becomes in a way it risks becoming
another mental scenario you know being in the matrix in a simulation of a matrix that in it's that
simulation there exists a simulation of the matrix and so on and this can go on forever now there's there's some
fantastic both series and black mirror episodes there that play on this theme that can leave one feeling quite
disturbed over this incapacity to ascertain what's it really like you know when waking up for a dream
and this dream is wow realizing that this is a dream and then waking up from this and this is a dream
yeah so if we get lost in the in the as if the mind the same mind remains in control that is used to
operating with this fixed logical categories that is entrenched in our mode of operating if we switch this to
become a more existential question an ontological question not an epistemological one all of a sudden
the dreaming body gets involved because we're going to have to cut through the noise and the turning
gears and the worries of the mechanisms of the as if scenario building mental mind and re and resort to
different faculties because we can no longer trust the mental faculties so how would i know how can i
find out and that how this is not a rhetorical question it's like if this is so let's say we're
in a simulation how the would i even know that right how do i find out where do i go
the wallpaper's peeling off and i can see the characters like in the matrix you know scrolling
neon green kind of thing where where do i go what what do i do what do i engage in and that allowing
that assets to seep in begins to produce some changes in the way we live in the way we perceive the
way we think and everything else not the contents not the actual answers not the playing with the as
if and you know aliens and whether this is simulation or matrix or dream or the plato's cave or the play
as some have it but the question itself what's it really like what if this is not it either how do i
find out how do i find out and have that become the baseline of operation it can it can you know
dissolve the mind or it can break the mind not all people make it in this process you know not i think
the the seeking ratio of those who actually venture far enough to achieve escape velocity and call it
whatever you want wake up become enlightened whatever these uh you know fat phrases that we use with so
much nonchalance i i think the the rate is this small up past a certain point there's there's severe
obstacles and and challenges to our functioning which can very easily amount to a mental breakdown
a psycho-emotional crash energetic malfunctioning disease shamanic disease is part of it or even death
in some cases schizophrenia not uncommon brilliant yes all right so i want to uh say back to you what i
took from some of what you said there um you know i can often see a position far ahead of what i'm capable
what i feel that i'm capable or seem to be capable of actually enacting or embodying so in a way i'm a bit like
uh a perspectival science fiction author okay i'm i create scenarios right and i can see far ahead
in a sense what seems to be ahead maybe it's just my head um
you can see your heads far ahead that's good that's exactly
uh but i'm not sure i i tend to enact them embody them and you're talking about a situation where
someone could become very fascinated by these as if worlds and of course one of the examples of
insight that has nothing to do with what is true per se is the entire oeuvre of science fiction
it's not there to tell you what is true it's there to give you perspectives and extrapolations
that are profoundly useful and change your capacity to have ideas right and to think about what it means
or could mean to be human or a being yeah or a machine or a world or time space or all of these things
right so it's very it's very rich um and was my primary means of education was just hundreds if
not thousands of science fiction stories um but my point is what you're talking about is
there's a difference between having a garden of interesting little perspectival mirrors
and actually getting in the water and becoming a boat like you can have a hundred different dreams of
boats right and that's not this and those dreams of boats can reflect off of each other and it can be
fun or insane or terrifying or boring or whatever it can be but that's totally different thing from
becoming a boat and actually you know on the water being in the water of the nature of origin of awareness
of consciousness of dreaming of waking of intellect of being right and having this vehicle in which
in which you're actually doing the being of the process of shedding the layers of delusion illusion
formal representational cognition human cultural ideas categories identity and language versus identity
and relation versus identity and origin or being okay if you're actually trying to cut through
the many veils of maya or delusion or illusion or self-deception or broken cognition that's also dangerous
and can result in bad problems right it's not just like well if you actually do it you're better off
it's not it's not only dangerous it's one ineffective and two at the end of the day it's an it's impossible
um for a reason which might sound simple expressed in words but again until you become that boat you're
talking about and have this experientially uh it will not have its full measure of impact
which is that you cannot cut across uh veils in layers of veils for the simple reason that they actually
do not exist the and the cutting across is actually what is endowing them with a solidity that they do
not themselves possess oh my god okay you're not supposed to say that
it will make any difference for most for most people won't make any difference it will remain an
as if for except for a few for whom it will be more than just an as if what you're talking about
earlier about the becoming a boat and and you know thousands of books of science fiction which if they
do their work right you know they get us to to beyond uh imagine alternative scenarios and futures and
possibilities um they make us question they make us wonder you know the point is not to consume
endlessly science fiction but to use that as a sort of uh nutrients you know as a fertilizer
that does us that plays a number on the mind that allows it to soften up its categories
to to become more more fluid to open up horizons to relax back into that dreaming body where this
creativity stemmed from in the first place um so the point is not the endless contents and the thousands
of of science fiction books which is the immediate plethora of you know illusion in that sense of the
you know illusionist fact and what if story as much as exactly the what if stories um but to turn on the
to turn backwards much like um your friend was telling you towards where the one the the the guy you
interviewed to turn back to turn backwards to context to switch from contents to context what is the
context of all of this what is an awareness is that context but that's still just the word what is the
awareness itself so to constantly do this turning it's a weird way to put it this way but it it really
feels like this even in the body to constantly turn it back inwards and backwards to look at the
to use your word origin of this that amounts in this multitude of impressions sensations books knowledge
talks exchanges life experiences seeming linearity or fluidity or or whatnot what's the origin point
which is also the point of this solution in a way because it's beyond the time space time frame in that
regards so to constantly turn back turn back turn back turn inwards and backwards even while engaging
with all of these things i'm not advocating you know close your eyes and go into navel gazing mode
for a while for many people this may need to be part of the practice because we lack the practice to settle
and turn in and back initially this may need to be a necessary step
it's actually an advanced step which i discourage people from learning or teaching any
anytime soon and i think there's there's great disfavor that has been done to meditation
by being taught so openly and early in the game to a bunch of people who for the most part are not
suited for it we need we need many other layers before arriving in meditation but it amounts to this
like turning inwards and backwards inwards and backwards and then being able to maintain this
inwards and backwards even as we move interact sleep cook eats piss fuck you know present projects
talk on stage die you know ride a motorcycle or sail a boat and still inwards turn inwards and and
backwards and not get lost in the contents the content is fascinating and the show steals us and
the attention gets drawn out into this and we forget this is part of the spell that has us be
zombies and in a trance because we forget we get drawn out and fascinating we get suckered into this
fascinating show well it's this thing again that i i only had this vision kind of for the first time
today so first of all everything you say like this is so valuable i feel like um i feel like a kid who
found a bank door open in the middle of the night and he walks into the bank there's nobody in there
and the alarm's off and the vault is wide open and the treasure is just sitting there just sitting
there like glowing i mean that's how i'm feeling right now this is not what i was expecting which is
also refreshing um although i didn't necessarily have highly organized expectations um
so i'm reminded again of this weird this fixture that um this faucet that is structuring the flow
of the relationship between in what i get that these are um convene these are terms of convenience
they're not real the structuring the flow between context and perceiver or being right environment
and one in the environment structuring that flow but it's also structuring the flow between origin
and death or whatever the opposite of origin is and if if you get an inspiration about that i'd love to hear
it's not really an opposite i wanted to offer you we're still in the realm of of uh allegories and
illustrations and so on but the shape that you are trying to describe and it's it's putting these
points apart at the at the distance and now i'll offer a different alternative where actually these
two are not even just convergent they're actually identical and the shape is a torus where what
emerges you know and it's it's it spreads out it fans out and then it reaches a point of maximum
expansion as it were and then it kind of converges and and this is both a linear and a non-linear process
this actually happens all the time you know and this expansion phase is what we call origin yes and
this contraction phase the crunch the whatever you want to call it is is what is what you call death
right well in a way the same sure that that's very sensible um and i appreciate the uh like it doesn't
even have to be a torus right it could be this right it can it can be coming out of here and going into
the structure right the faces right and then it disappears somewhere down here there's a center
point here then it rises up this side and goes back into the invisibleness right doesn't necessarily
have to be a torus this by itself is an interesting toy of it or could be you could be made it come useful
um i mean i'm not i'm not reading from the book of darren right now i'm trying actually to see better
which one i'm at my best is what i'm up to um
maybe the opposite of origin
is the delusion is the delusion of known identities functions forms situations and relationships
maybe that's what i mean by the opposite because when i think of origin i don't necessarily mean
merely where things come from i mean the clear seeing that arises in relation as origin
so like in a sense clear seeing and origin are the same thing
and deluded sort of zombieist waking mind oh i know what's going on um it's kind of the opposite i
don't know what are your thoughts it maps um one of the traditions that has some of this best mapped
of what i've encountered is is tibetan buddhism it's vajrayana and essentially what you've described
there translates in in their jargon as the definition of nirvana and samsara yeah so you have the
you've seen awareness that has no divisions and it's essentially on undividing and then you have
the multitude of forms and moreover not even the for just the forms but the identification with forms
and the impression of separateness and the the isolation of this and that of of self and others
of i and and bow and everything else which is what makes up the samsaric world they're essentially
undivided they cannot be otherwise but they express in these two forms as it were and one is the
ever-present origin to use a phrase that is not mine yeah sir yeah gene gap that's right uh that is
constantly there is the center is the center that is everywhere is black elk used to say yes and the
other one is the identification of objects with objects of self with self and others and the deludedness
not the illusion you know not just the game of forms known as a game of forms but the deludedness of
these being having value meaning importance of consisting of something there's a difference here
between delusion and and illusion the illusion is believing it as it were believing it for real
right whereas an illusion we can be with it and just enjoy the show knowing it is illusory knowing
it is empty you know knowing that these are just contents on the formless context in that regards
and seeing it for what it is illusory so again i'm going to come back to this um
this device this uh appliance that structures waking consciousness and does the thing my son was
talking about of assuring us of the knowable continuity and categorical identity of things
beings situations relationships histories all these things right imagine that there's like a little
like the kind of a thing that structures water on the end of a hose right and it's splitting the
water into these parts that we were taught to split this way as children in language and category and
so forth right but it does something else it does something really weird you know how water when it
sprays out of the hose in the sunlight there's all these lighting effects like there's rainbows and it's
iridescent and the water is shining and sparkling or even if you just look for example at the ocean
at sunset right you'll see this coruscating layer of light on the surface of it that's very enchanting
and powerful i think and is is actually mystically profound in my view um this nozzle
it takes away the real light the actual effect of the illumination and it puts something dead there
it kills the the living light that would naturally arise from the relationship between interior
and and and context right as these two things are relating on the two sides of the taurus for
example right there's this light that is the the sort of hallmark or effect of their interaction and
of course we can say there is no interaction they're the same thing yes yes of course i get it but um
um this this faucet head it it makes fake light it it takes the living light of awareness and relation away it
it sort of hides that shit by producing all these artifacts and you can see this in in human behavior with
representations especially at the social or cultural level they just make dead light all the time and the dead light is
brighter than the living light i mean it's it's serious photographs videos and you know um
i ideological declarations um all these things that the humans make it's like a kind of dead light but
it's very compelling and part of why it can be compelling is because there are features of
representations of representational cognition which i'm thinking of as this faucet head sort of right
that's structuring the flow that would otherwise be very amazing and diversely
sophisticated and beautiful it would dance it would be musical it's killing all that down into
manipulable structure manipulable with the dead inside aspect of what we could think of as the left
hemisphere it's a grave oversimplification let's call it pseudo left hemispheric style right like
it wants dead it can grasp and manipulate and count and analyze and is predictable and so forth because
that reduces vigilance by reducing ambiguity and making prediction very simple let's be very clear
if you if you're concerned about having accurate predictions the best thing you can do is kill
everything everything everything dead your prediction is going to be amazing every time you're going to
be right every time you just right just kill that right and now you got perfect predictability which
makes you look like a god because now you can accurately put it the more you can accurately predict
the future the more enlightened you must be right you've escaped the mystery of time just by killing
everything right so there's these really huge problems in human
collective cognition as moderns right there's all these weird little features i named you know this
this triumvirate of vigilance ambiguity and prediction anytime you can reduce ambiguity you
reduce the vigilance burden all animals want a lesser vigilance burden and and anything humans since
we can actually manipulate the environment this is why we live in dead inside houses right look around
me there's one thing moving here me all that other stuff is dead i don't have to worry about that
it's not going anywhere right the wall is not going to start like a hand is not going to come out
of the wall i don't have to you know determine what's going on it's not going to happen this stuff
is dead i don't have to worry about it's there's no ambiguity right the only ambiguity is like can i pay the
rent is the landlord coming over does the electricity work you know where's the food going to come in
from but that's the mpu um so i'm blathering on a little bit but i want to i want to actually
return to a topic we've explored i think very fruitfully and brilliantly which is um
you know as a student of zen for a long time and i'm not making any kind of claim about
my uh i'm making the opposite of a claim that i'm an experienced zen person or something i've been
sitting zazen for a long time and i go through phases where i sit some and then not so much um
so i'm just trying to say i'm not an expert but i mean i would call myself a novus after 40 years
in any case um trying to understand what okay yeah now we're going to get into a huge problem so
i made a whole recording with some friends on the problem of what like what is the sound of one
hand clapping well it turns out that one hand clapping if you could hear it literally might sound
like what what now this is an intellectual spin right but it's also even that intellectual spin
is useful because it's also that trying to figure out what is going on or what that is or what is you
know what is moo what is moo a lot of these questions start with what and it strikes me very you know
one this is also one hand clapping right um it strikes me that this what is actually a huge problem
um because we don't want to figure out what something is or what is going on well it's it's only it's only a huge problem
if we attempt to to answer it the way it's uh
sound stopped can you can still hear me okay yeah the way it's it was
you're breaking up okay sounds a bit weird let me check yeah you're breaking up
should be all right um so this what only becomes a problem you see this is one of the issues with taking um
um a practice style out of its context that he grew up in and without the full understanding of how it is to be applied
fundamentally on some on some level the whole you know bushy plethora of varietals of of koans and
and uh equivalents there and the what's and who's and how's um are really just personal aesthetic or
functional choices of the teacher and the student and this or this teacher student combo to essentially
inject that what or who as a question in the practice
um zen practice fundamentally if it if you it's it's reduced to just sitting without uh containing
this element of what i mentioned earlier suspicion the doubt and the undermining of the
of the our our thinking and perceptual structures will amount to little more than just you know glorified
vegetating on some level and then people will think they're doing zen or they're doing zazen
basically what needs to happen there at the same time is this drilling but not as a mental process
but as this backwards and inwards looking of what what what is this who is having this experience who is
what is what is this experience what is the nature of of what i call reality what is what is this awareness
all of these amount to nothing in intellectual terms and the point is actually not to answer these
questions the moment we actually give an answer to that what we've completely missed the point we've
taken that what in the wrong direction taken it seriously as it were in the wrong way and
and answered it on its on its level that actually is a method for self-destruction if we can put it this way
it's meant to lead to that dissolution of of the very mind that's even asking that question in the first
place who's having this who's seeing who's hearing who's sitting here who's asking these questions who's
thinking these thoughts what is this awareness that's present constantly you know these are words
there's a faculty saying these words i'm witnessing it clearly i'm not it or i wouldn't be able to
witness it any more than an eye can see itself then what is witnessing it it's not these words themselves
the what is behind the what and the point is to return to that nameless origin that is behind the what that
is behind the who and that's that's the the essence or the the intent of these to be used as arrows to be
used as as daggers if you if you will if you get caught in the day in the game of answering them
we're lost yes yes this is um what you now every time i use the word what i'm gonna laugh um what
you've just been sharing about is fundamentally crucial to the pursuit of awakening
because
an intellectual approach to koans is almost the exact opposite of the purpose of engaging them
um and could be deadly to awakening possibly even to humans um because it can result in a kind of it's
the same thing we were talking about a moment ago the left hemisphere like aspect of awareness it wants
dead manipulables so it gets really interested in the question of what is moon and it feels like i can
figure that out right and so effectively what happens is you're building a skyscraper where you
want a force or you know a flowing stream or something right you want you want the pure organic
thing not the construct um you know it occurred to me in a conversation with a close friend some time
ago for the first time as somebody who sat with move for a long time
that intellectually one could understand joshu chouchu saying moo you know when asked uh does
even this dog have buddha nature says moo which essentially means no um he's certainly not saying no
uh and it occurred to me again intellectually and i'm doing this he's saying he's both saying and not
saying no there's there's an issue as i said with taking these out of context that we flatten them yeah
um on on some level and i'm going to be a bit a bit uh let's say overly firm maybe in saying or or
overly strict in saying what i'm about to say but uh doing these things outside the supervision of someone
who is very i'm not going to say knowledgeable but experienced of these and ideally at least in the
tradition and context of zen uh who which doesn't dick around with stuff zen is not keen on on building
structures and explanations you know and explanatory scaffolding zen is basically a bunch of demolition
guys gone haywire yes yeah um and in the zen there's only one touchstones and that's realization
does someone have realization and zen is based on realization and on the validation of realization and
the trend it cannot this cannot be transmitted but it can be verified so unless you work in the context
of someone who is a supervisor who has experiential understanding of this again i'm avoiding
knowledgeable because it's not about knowledge experiential understanding of it it's it's actually
more about embodiment back to our dreaming body than to then then about knowledge and the mind and ideally
realization otherwise it's the blind leading the blind or eventually the one-eyed man leading the blind or
the almost blind ones and so on so that's why these things get really lost the moment they're trapped in
books and people read the books and they read them with the same entrapping mind that splits like your
faucets the jets in a specific shape and all of that and the zen just gets flushed out with
all the rest in the process and you're losing a marvelous opportunity yeah that might have been much
better if you've never read any zen books in the first place yeah just go meet your teacher clueless
about what zen is yeah but meet a teacher yeah yeah meet a rose yeah it's good everything you say i trust
it i appreciate the severity uh it is authentically um from the zen tradition this uh severity and
it's true what you say i thought of something while you were speaking that is interesting and i want to also
return to the other um the the dreaming body
you know we have these tropes in english uh the one-eyed man leading the blind and so forth and blah blah
blah blah blah right but the actual problem we're facing is way worse than that way worse that's a shitty trope
because the problem that we're facing is that a man with one fake eye is leading people who have actual eyes
eyes and neither of them can see right so there's like a phony eye this is this this like our whole
discussion orbits this one thing right we're seeing our waking experience with a phony with like two
different phony eyes and they they have absolute authority in our common experience and among our
peers they actually believe everything these fake eyes tell them pretty much right and they're very
confused about the difference between what the fake eyes tell them and their interiority and their
feelings and their experiences and their emotions and all kinds of psychological fucking labyrinths
right result from the fake eyes that tell us what's going on who that is i'm talking this guy
that's what's supposed to happen blah blah all these fake eyes which have a lot to do with representational
cognition and a lot to do with enculturation in what i would call fictional collectives these are not
actual collectives humans these are like processes that have captured humans and produce like what's
going on in the ukraine or the middle east or um walmart whatever you want to pick right um so yeah
i just want to say like the one-eyed man leading the blind would be amazing compared to what we're going
through because what we're going through is a nightmare made up of that just gets
further entrenched and made more explicit and more common among people and more confusing generation
after generation after generation you know i've heard people say yeah it's a nightmare like i've
heard people saying like oh you know the humans uh take heart they're about to wake up this is the
great awakening of the human no i don't think so right i'm not seeing anything that even slight
yeah that that's actually the fake eyes talking right so yeah i just want to clarify that because
actual blind people i want to be led by an actual blind person they're not deceived by by the fake eyes
right at least they're actually probably sensing with their body what's going on
right yeah yeah they're way more sensitive than us uh colonized by the visual sense when it comes to
that actually you almost trust more a blind person it's great to spot the weakness of that of that
trope and uh yeah it would be an easy situation if it's just a matter of blind leading the blind we'd
know what we have to work on right whereas in what you're describing it's it's it's much harder to
work our way out of the labyrinth yeah what you're talking about and i'll make for a nice segue for
another time we're coming up against our couple of hours here actually um what you're talking about
is essentially 1984 yes the the issue at stake is is is that is we're living in 1984 this is no longer in
the future is no longer a possibility this is the double speak this is the fake eye imposing a reality
and the eye that can see but does not believe what it's seeing because of the fake eye this is the
confusion this is the default to authority this is the subjection to fear and the you know uh absorbing of
those standards of fake seeing as being true seeing in the very presence of true seeing and
and all of this and the issue is that this is what is happening right now and this is not something we're
going to be contending with you know 1984 and black mirror are are were premonitory materials but they're
actually realistic pros in filmmaking when it comes to our current situation and because too few people
take that seriously enough um we're hung in that space it's not necessarily that people take it
seriously there's something weirder going on which is that um i was writing about this yesterday and you
know see see what you think about this feel free to push back if this doesn't fit you know with what you
um and also yeah there's we definitely have to do this again because i want another couple hours
of material there's more material yeah but um
okay the problem is in a sense that this isn't this goes with my concept of thrisps right which are
they are structured echoes in the network of human minds that act like
competing like organisms competing for dominance which actual organisms i don't think they do that
but these things do and i'm not going to go into a long lecture about that what i'm going to say is
these are like processes that capture humans to enact and preserve them in the cognitive and
behavioral layer of human existence right and the thing about it is that the dead inside processes
and the people that are captured by those the the better they are captured the more capable they
are of organizing and the less people are captured the less capable they seem to be of organizing we have
no way there's not a common method that we are familiar with to create uh little collectives that
can do things we're pretty good at talking about stuff we can get together and talk about things
but generally we very rarely and this is one of the things i like about you i know that you
occasionally at least occasionally you get a group of people together and you do some work together
right and i think that's amazing and i and i honor and respect that what i'm trying to say is sort of
the the um you know the dark side of the force really good at organizing the jedi they suck at
organizing they're like these lone wolves you know tumbling around falling down a mountainside
trying to like you know keep the lightsaber still working and they don't get together and form a
collective that could i'm not saying that they have to attack the dark side either i think one of the
things we could do is just go on missions that are beautiful together right like
fucking solve an actual problem in someone's life or the world or a situation together as a team that
would be amazing if we could just do that apparently we can forge sports teams and military intelligence
units and like there's no tomorrow but but we're not really forming teams to retrieve and enact our
humanity and it's it's urgent originary potencies in our culture in our current form of civilization and
alcohol in our culture and on no recognizable scale because such i will call them imaginal cells in terms of
small collectives like this exist the thing you're pointing out is a much larger conversation which
we're not going to broach here but it's actually more of an elemental dynamic of forces between the
expand the generative expansiveness which essentially just blows up constantly new shapes much like dreaming
does as it were and a different kind of force which is more about coalescing you know cooling things
down you know one is more like a stellar emission and ejection process and stars don't build at the
end of the day right you know they may have spontaneous patterning that occurs but mostly they
just burn stuff up and there's that generativeness now at the same time everything is essentially
facilitated by starlight by heat we owe we owe life to star heat right like our sun to stellar equivalent
processes like fire within us for that matter and so on and so forth yes and then there's a cooling
forces that hold it together and our own earth would not hold together uh if it hadn't cooled down from the
stellar matter stuff that it was before now if we take these things personally we will start seeing
these as you know liberals and conservatives and and stuff like that but it's really far more more
elemental though what you're talking about there is at a different level in the org organizational sense
and you know how certain processes we tend to default to heavy what you're describing is actually a
sort of defaulting to heavy because of how our culture is oriented and this is a topic for yet
another time we're living a death death phobic culture that is actually death oriented and that
is this constant contraction mode that you're talking about and allowing this parasite processes that have
taken over humans in that sense to organize in ways in which what you're essentially describing is cancer
yeah as opposed to the bustle of a living organism and so on which doesn't proliferate randomly right
it's not going to be like the guys sliding down you know mountain sides like you're describing yes but
they're not gonna you know create large congregation and want to take up more space and organize
pass their point a liver will not out liver its role plates its own function you know white cell won't
get curious about what red cells do you know or get white cells together so they can form an alternate
liver because fuck this shit if we're gonna deal with these guys anymore now they kind of play their
role and they get generated and reabsorbed and generated and reabsorbed and cancer on the other hand
it's about unity it's about homogenizing it's about growth without limits and and and taken and taken over
and a sort of unhealthy equality so to speak in in that regard yes uh as opposed to the you know fertile
creative organized chaos of everything else that is a living organism yeah i mean organ right organized
means the preservation of distinct elements in relation right it doesn't one organ you know i agree
that's brilliant yeah everything you said perfect makes perfect sense
so grateful um what a privilege i actually feel like we weren't merely talking about things but
i mean i was having some direct experiences of what we were talking about and
i just treasure um your way in the world and your uh your path and the privilege of sharing
some of that together yeah i really appreciate you
thanks for inviting this darren thanks for this opportunity and yes maybe the ripples of this will
reverberate past our little spark of a cell here in the exchange we've had and uh yeah we'll let this
ripple in our own lives and see uh see what this brings up and what we get to dream about yes onwards
and further all right my friend more soon i hope again sometime soon
yes thank you be well and keep in touch stay in the body i'd like to you too thanks for now
so soon bye darren bye bye everybody
