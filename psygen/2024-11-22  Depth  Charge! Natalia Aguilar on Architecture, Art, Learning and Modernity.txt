nice to see you nice to see you
i've got my coffee how about you i've got some water but i'm gonna refill it since
we might be here for a minute so give me just a sec i'll be right back sure
you look beautiful today thank you i'm putting on these um so i won't get this
um echo sometimes so oh yeah can you can you hear me can you hear me well yeah everything's perfect
all right yeah i'm so excited to have this chance to talk with you today
oh it is it i was um we should have done this a long time ago i guess yes yes we should have
that yeah so uh yeah the topic you you want to introduce the topic or how how do you want to go
about this little chit chat um i think i'm gonna just shut my window here so there's a little less
background noise i like the fresh air but uh there's gonna be some traffic and stuff and it's raining so
get the preliminaries out of the way um and i'd be very grateful if you wouldn't mind introducing the
topic you want me to introduce the topic if you feel comfortable yeah well um you know i left los angeles
uh under a very uh weird circumstance back in 74 and i wanted to study architecture uh and everybody
said are you crazy why are you leaving los angeles i mean you could go to the school over there and
i was in high school but i i didn't like uh the life there and some of the things that you've mentioned
in your videos everything's so square everything's so square and because of the houses you know the
the frames the way the houses were built uh i thought people were very paranoid and that this whole uh
environment uh uh inside the home around the homes around the neighborhoods the whole uh suburbia
notion there was so many things that i found it uh weird and and i would visit my grandmother in mexico city
and everything was just hustle and bustle and the city's very very old very very old it's you know
like seven thousand years old
so so the the there's things that i i could sense about mexico that were not in this modern
society where i grew up so i thought i thought um no um i need to study architecture with the pyramid builders
so that that set me off into a path of understanding what people were thinking when when they design
things when they create things and i was very disappointed with uh the whole um aspect of the
university because well it trains you to
you to always be on on alert for business you know business opportunities right right the primary motive
is not is disoriented right the motive that is supposed to be there which we might imagine to be
things like um learning uh actual developmental uh efflorescence flowering right um growth
development in the in the virtuous sense of what development means um seeing better together
for each other and our ancestors and the future all of these things have been paved over
with one value cash dollars or possibly um the preservation and distribution of power in human hierarchies
these two exactly yeah exactly and and the thing that that always caught me uh was this phoniness
and and and and mind you i i was one of those people who admired a lot of the movies and storytelling
and things that i enjoyed uh while i was in uh elementary school was these uh times that we went to uh
universal city and and and we got to see how the movies were made and this was something that i was i i just
wanted to know how how these uh special effects were done and of course everybody was very shy and very
good and everybody behaved very well but i had to raise my hand and and ask and they're like okay
little girl what do you want to know how do you make those cobwebs
on the monsters and and all these other things that i i i loved all these old movies with monsters you know
the the dripping of the eye and and all the the special effects on makeup and and i knew it was
you know i could watch the movie but i was just intrigued how did they go how do they make it so real
i mean it's the acting it's the lighting it's ah everything and then you know kind of like that early interest
of uh the making of or or the back part of uh who does the decision making how do you know which side
of the door is the monster going to you know the writer and and how they're they're they're thinking
like oh no it's too expensive let's do this then you know so so there's this uh economy added to to the
to the fakeness because they can't afford to be too realistic you know well i just want to mention
something that i think may be uh both relevant and unexpected um
like you i grew up well uh i'm not sure we don't have to discuss our actual ages but um
i grew way back when yes many moons ago right you know back when there were dinosaurs uh
but um i grew up watching uh films in the 60s and 70s and we saw things like um journey to the
center of the earth there were dinosaurs in there yeah mysterious island there were some giant you know
crab monsters and iguana monsters um the the ocean thing i was very into that uh how many leagues under
the sea 20 000 leagues under the sea that was just like oh my favorite movie mine too because i was
enchanted by the ocean i i was just an ocean-going person and you know uh talking about homes i could
feel the moment i stepped into the beach on the ocean this sense of home a real sense of home it was
just like entering into a different dimension but it was so compelling and so those movies are the ones
that really you know stir me up that's funny because you picked so um i was exposed to jules verne when
i was very young my parents were reading me uh just a second i'm gonna have to actually grab this since
i have it near five um we have these books uh-huh right oh yeah at the library i spend a lot of time
at the library i was i would go on my bicycle and just sit there this book is from okay 1876 wow
wow and uh this is uh every boy's library right it's got some dust on it but yeah so my parents
are reading me this book this is journey to the center of the earth when i was you know four right
and i saw um journey to the center of the earth on television um i saw uh seven voyage the seventh
voyage of sinbad right a lot of anima animated skeletons and you know genies i think there was a and i'm going
somewhere here i think there was a a film about uh the greek adventurer um was it odysseus
that meets the cyclops oh oh the what's it called um odyssey the
yeah it's it it has to do with uh the troy and helen and this um
ulysses ulysses yes yeah yeah that's what that's where where they get lost and they go all over
the place and it's just you know there was a giant uh cyclops that they fought yes yes yes yes
and and then when i saw it and the makeup wasn't that good either uh no it wasn't great but i i
still i've got something to say about all this so and then i saw 20 000 leagues under the sea and
that completely captured my heart totally i was like i want to i want to be captain nemo when i grow up
i want to protect the oceans those people shouldn't be doing they shouldn't be using the ocean for war
that's a bad thing captain nemo is great he should he's a true hero i believe in him he's right
um and by the way i don't know if you know this but uh his name nemo it comes from mimosini the mother
of the fuses the mother of memory the ocean is the memory right of the origins of life so nico exactly
yes the protector of mimosini's womb essentially right so you're not going to make war on this
surface of this ever right oh no so that was very powerful for me um those that story particularly set
me on a path of kind of uh what i would call like extreme altruism or possibly heroic altruism um but
what i want to get is this you know modern movies i cannot watch them the effects that are done with
computers they mess up my brain i can feel something is wrong like if they show the ocean in the background
of the ship right i can feel that it's wrong there's something mechanically um unnatural yeah
it's like a form of it doesn't sparkle the right way yeah and the waves are wrong they don't have
the budget to do it right they got it they have to let ai fix it for them yeah i don't know exactly
what it is but i have the same problem with like led lamps i can't stand the light that comes out of
leds it it feels the vibration you can feel the vibration yeah the frequency it biologically messes
it messes me up i i have to run from the supermarket or anything that has these uh stupid lights blue
lights especially oh god the vibration is just utterly i don't know here we uh for for some some
idiot decided to replace all of the street lights with leds and they make terrifying shadows from the
trees they're all jagged and multi-linear and it's just awful i mean it just makes me it's it's like
physically repulsive to me it's it's it's actually torture i think it's torture it's a form of torture
visual torture it must be really bad for the animals and insects too because if they're even slightly more
sensitive than i am they must be just miserable um because that stuff is just terrible so we you know
again we have the same problem where something that's posing as advancement or development is
actually torment right it's very bad it is it's physically the whole city the whole city is is
designed to uh eliminate any real stimulus you know like the stars why why do they have so many freaking
lights outside i would always say well can't you see it no no no safety you know the name of safety
this idiotic thing that they think that people all they want is to be safe and i'm thinking
you know you've never asked anybody what they want they just slam it on you yeah
safety convenience these are two of the selling points of doom right um it's safety quote unquote
that caused our government here to record every single phone call that everyone makes in the entire
nation um and to invade our privacy and to spy on us essentially it's for the safe safety right we're
trying to keep you safe no they they're not they're not giving us any safety and they're not getting
safety either what they're doing is learning because they they're so empty see the thing is that they are
empty and they have to suck every bit of information that we might you know uh share so there's a feature
here that i think is important to highlight which is and and i want to go about this somewhat delicately
but also relatively quick quickly so i'm not lecturing
what we have are not societies these are not societies also we did not forge them we didn't make the
agreements and set the motivations uh that our societies enact and we have actually nearly no voice
in what they do or how they do it um the the sort of dead ghost of voting pretty much useless right
um it's it's like a it's sort of like a red herring to distract us from the fact that we have no voice
at all so they give us this sort of um you know little morsel exactly they give us like a like a fake
lottery ticket right yeah you each get one ticket right okay but um we never forged actual agreements
together so there is no we this we that we hear all the time that i'm gonna say this word it doesn't
represent anything it represents the absence of the possibility of an actual us right and this is so
prevalent in our modernity absences of society of nations of humanity of intelligence of the university
of of actual learning and education these absences present as presences right and i just want to say a
couple of other brief things about this there is a feature that arises in the absence
of human collective awareness and mutual concern and agreement there's a there's a thing that arises
there and it's i don't think it's a being it's like the absence of a being and the absence of a being
is infinitely hungry and it's also infinitely vulnerable and the reason it's infinitely vulnerable
is because there's nothing there and if anyone discovers that there's nothing there they will
destroy it right they will fill it with something and it will die the emptiness will die so what it hates
it despises anything that is alive anything that is vital anything that has relational integrity
it despises love it despises humanity or organism or living places or beings or actual relationships
or real agreements because all of those things are a fundamental threat to its to the necessity of its
absolute sovereignty over all phenomena and so this is this is what happened yeah that's that's why they
they create the control grid you know because it's it's important to them that nothing escapes
their their control because you know if you if you're not paying attention to them they they they feel
they feel worse it's like oh it's like stabbing them you know you're actually stabbing them because
you're ignoring them right and so um fear and outrage uh and desperation and agony these are ways
to get you to pay attention to them right oh yeah right if you're terrified they will squeeze you
and destroy you and destroy you and do absolutely everything i mean the first thing they do is take
your money or your uh your your ability to make money or to make a living part of how they do that
that's why they take you off the land you know if you have a piece of land even if you have a pot
outside your door they don't want your pot to grow anything they will put a a wall so the sun won't
get to that little plant you've got you know they're going to torture your ability to be independent
in any way just breathing is already something they've been polluting non-stops since they
created these stupid uh things with wheels yeah i mean there were already things with wheels all over
the place and many of them could you know they can work with water but they had to get rid of those
you know yeah it's bad for business inventors or something they kill on a daily basis you know
how dare you invent something yes in um in tani perla in chiapas uh which you know there's a i have a
little mural it's up above my door you can't maybe i can turn this just to see it i can see oh up up so
like that tiny one that is a mural from tani perla and um the chiapas people were being killed there
they were poisoning the army was poisoning the river the river water to try to kill them to take
their land because they have land and they can grow things on it right they can live right how dare you
live exactly one of my close friends jeff conant in the 90s he him and a group of people from
countries around the world they went to tani perla to try to help the chiapas people there um and they
brought them medicine uh they brought them um medical stuff all kinds of seeds to grow food um
they brought them water purification systems they brought them um things to teach them how
to make aqueducts so that they could get water that wasn't poison the army was just sitting upstream
from them dumping stuff into the river to kill the chiapan indians right because they need water
right so it's really easy just poison the water all people die um eventually the army surrounded
the village with tanks like they rolled in there with tanks and they said like
give us the gringos we're gonna just kill you all right now you know and so they talked with
they talked with my friend and the people who were with them there were about 40 people from
different countries that went there and um my friend and his you know his cohort they were like
okay yeah don't we don't want them to kill you so we'll we'll go you know we'll go with them and
they put them in a bus and they chained them to the seats and they drove them out in the middle of the
forest and everybody should bury them out there you know and then at the last moment they got
a call from the government said no we can't that's gonna that's gonna cause these people are from like
spain and germany and the united states this is gonna be a huge incident there's gonna be
yeah if you just hear them yeah right it's not like uh what you can do with the people of guatemala or
mexico where you can just bury them and you know the world doesn't really pay attention so to speak i mean
what a horrible idea so um they shipped them out and they told them you know you can never return
to mexico under any circumstances right but this is just an example of i want to be really clear about
something the they this really weird thing because it's an in human it's an array it's a library of in
human processes that are enacted by humans that these processes have captured it's as if the people who
do these things have been internally colonized by money power and some kind of like historical
inaction of these functions right someone did this before they got away with it we can do it again
so it's as if these people are internal like their soul has been colonized their mind has been colonized
their body has been colonized in the sense that they are now the automatons that carry out the
uh atrocities in the name of something that isn't human humans do it but it's not human it's very
strange oh no it's it's it's the in the realm of ideas you know so in the realm of ideas these ideas
are so toxic and but that that doesn't mean they can't reproduce you know they can reproduce
yes because they're toxic you know like deadly poison they find a substance that that will transform
you've probably heard of transmutation you know uh the the the ability of uh let's say chickens to
produce eggs you know that has a lot of calcium that's more calcium than they actually eat how do
they come up with that much calcium well the body has this magical power to produce and transform
whatever nutrients they have into whatever things are necessary so this transmutation is also apparent in
in the ability to stick to to to an idea that that it's a belief system so this belief system is is just
as powerful as the our belief system in in life and so the that uh there's a trigger that it's calling for
death they don't like life but they're calling somebody come kill me please come kill me because i hate
life and so they do all these atrocities and nobody kills them and they keep doing worse things and
nobody comes and kills them they're just like feel pity for them they're like oh this poor soul is lost
or whatever you know you make up excuses for the stupid idiot that's doing worse and worse and worse
atrocities day after day hour after hour and he he he wants to end his life but he can't he doesn't have
the courage or the ability to do it himself he's that small or that empty or that uh useless for
all sorts of words that to describe this uh horror inner horror that they're living because they don't
like themselves and not just don't like themselves they don't like the fact that their life is going to
end but they want to know when it's going to end so they create these situations where they are at
risk and it it becomes like a pedestal or a crutch that they will use over and over and over again i
mean guns think about guns for a minute guns and and all the stupid things that they've come up with
to to to create that situation where they can do away with this life that they don't understand and
they and they can't appreciate because if they did they'd be like this
so okay there's some things i want to touch on here first of all um in his book which i'm also going to
grab since i have it right here and it's really very important this book um it's one of the most
important books i've ever come across and i'm i'm a lover of books uh in his book the master and his
emissary the divided brain making of the western world i have i have not read that in the gilchrist
talks in in a deep way about um and i'm so glad he wrote that book because it saved me from having
to write it i was writing about the same topics you know over 20 years ago now um he proposes that
there are certain features of the style that we associate with the left hemisphere right side of the
body right that um it doesn't it first of all it doesn't care at all about things that are a lot
now let me be really clear the hemispheres form a unity and they're connected by the corpus callosum
and the corpus callosum also separates them they have to be kept separate or you get feedback which
produces seizures so it has a very complex job and again this won't be a long lecture
um the right hemisphere can be understood as sort of the the primeval forest the origin
of the possibility of identity for the left hemisphere but it when it's by itself it would
destroy this thing if it could get away with it it can't stand the idea that there's any extrinsic
authority other than it and it will lie through its teeth um if you we used to have this thing called
the water test where you could anesthetize uh the right hemisphere left side of the body right
and then you can talk just to the left hemisphere and you ask it questions like um can you move your
left hand it's like that's not mine take that away my mother left that here tell her to come back and
get it right it would just make stuff straight just make stuff that's a piece of wood that's not me
make it go away it can't stand when it's on its own it hates life it just lies like crazy any threat to
its absolute sovereignty is met with uh devastating intent of destruction right just kill that thing
get rid of it it would literally kill itself just to get rid of the side of the body that isn't it
right exactly yes yes yes that's that's like uh you know the story of of the two wolves right
mm-hmm but feel free yeah if for people who haven't heard it the weird thing about the two wolves is
that the the sort of you you you tell the story so that people will um basically it's a very simple
trope you have two wolves inside you you know one is one is it's the grandpa talking to the grandchild
oh you please and the grandchild is is saying why are you so quiet uh grandfather and he says
they're fighting who's fighting grandfather there's two wolves inside me they're fighting
and and the kid's like what what the hell's going on you know and so after a while the kid's like all
right tell me who's winning i want to know if they're fighting who's winning and he says
the one i feed but he describes the the wolves he describes one is kind one is uh always there
always uh helpful and it has all the virtues and then there's the other one who's nasty and
buying and and bitter and constantly bickering about absolutely everything so he describes the two wolves
i mean then he's quiet for a while you know and then the kid's kind of like well yeah but who's
winning and so he says well the one here i'm feeding which one am i feeding right right so what's
interesting though about those wolves is that they also have an another feature that maybe the grandfather
doesn't actually state which is that the gentle wolf is easily satiated by a small meal
the other wolf cannot be satiated by any amount of food it is infinitely hungry it will eat the world if
you let it and still be hungry um so we live in a world where these forces are at play and actually
i'm not sure it's the people who are a they it seems like it's something
the people get captured just like um the spaniards were colonized before they landed in south america and
just started laying waste to the culture there they were internally colonized before they became
colonizers i'm not asking that we um pity them right or even that we have merciful thoughts about
them though it could be useful to do so i'm not asking for that though i'm trying to get us you know
about the promised land right do tell you know that uh columbus was actually jewish there's a book
there's a number of books um about a year ago i i did a video i i think you know i do a lot of videos
but in spanish and i did this research because it was going to be columbus day it was october last year
and i found this interesting um researcher from spain and she did an expensive uh and came to the
conclusion that he was jewish because he would write to his son and had these little symbols in in uh
in hebrew okay it's it's it's very interesting it's very interesting the whole yeah the hebrew
and so uh the thing is that that the story goes that the queen isabella uh took her jewels and and
helped him build the ship so that that he could go off and and and uh and explore this uh the
possibility of a new route that they were looking for a new route according to commerce
ha ha ha no there was these jewish uh guys that paid all this money two of them and she found the
receipts how much money he paid he got paid and he was given the money to do get the ships and and it's
all there it's all there very interesting research and and he he promised the jewish people that they
you know when he set off the day the jews were expelled from spain all right so that's when
it was the last day they could be in spain without getting their throats cut other the other jews
turned into catholics yeah because a lot of people say well i'm not going to leave my business i'll just
switch religions and everything's fine and they changed their names and they changed everything and
the thing is that by that date they had been expelled from i don't know 200 different cities all over the
place and and and who expels who they expel them because they they were money lenders and according
to their religion they don't have to follow uh god's will they are the chosen ones and they for can
do whatever they can raise your interest then or take your child or you know a little bit of that
rumple still skin is is in there you know all these things are true they're all true and for two or three
thousand years they kept ruining city after city after city because they got them in debt they promised
this they promised that you should you buy this here i'll lend you the money and then next thing you
know everybody owes them money and so this whole thing keeps repeating and repeating and repeating
but they didn't care how many lives were ruined uh wherever they went you know because it was a scam
they were scamming people over and over so they had to move and they had to move and they had to move
to a place where they weren't known so so they they were out columbus was was in charge of finding the
promised land so one of the reasons all these people were so savage is that oh we found our promised
land and you are not welcome because we just don't want you here and so they killed just about as many
people as they could and until somebody says no no no no no let's let's be good uh jesuits and use them
convince them and and and find a soul for them because well they're not maybe they're not savages
the way we think anyway the thing is the story the story that they believe where they are special where
they can do as they please and they're allowed to kill others is perfect just perfect for them
not for all the rest of us it strikes me that most modern cultures have a kind of a similar story
and um i'm cautious about i just want to say for myself i don't i'm not trying to deny what we have
records of historically although the people who write the records are also have motivations but um oh yeah
oh yeah let me just be very clear uh personally for myself i'm extremely cautious about indicting
whole ethnicities um i'm sure there were jews who were money lenders and i'm also certain that there
were jews who were not right so i i don't want myself i don't want to say for example well the jews
are just bad people but that's not oh no no no no no no no just to be clear right because some of that's
no no no no of course not and mind you i have a cousin who's married to a rabbi lives in nazareth
all right yeah many of my close friends i have all sorts of connections and dear dear friends i love
the jewish people i love the jewish culture yeah yes yes yes yes we have to clarify someone watching
this how confused this little thing about columbus was a big eye-opener for me as well because he didn't
speak uh latin he spoke spanish because he grew up in spain he was actually from the spanish peninsula
and and he he he had nothing to do with with italy or uh any of the things beneath he wasn't venetian
the way they said he was venetian and all these things that were made up around him well it turns
out it wasn't true so you know and and and that's not the only book written by uh these and they're
spanish of course and they wanted to get to the bottom of the whole thing they they a lot of researchers
have done a lot of stuff on columbus anyway uh but what i'm saying is uh to back up what we were saying
about being colonized the word colon means columbus okay so that's how famous columbus was that he got
to have this whole idea idea the idea of colonization a way of uh giving him this this special uh notion
he became a notion from coming from being a person to being a hero to becoming this whole notion of
colonizing so now that we colonize our our everything is is really really interesting i've always been
fascinated how you you use words and because i was a an interpreter for my mother since i was i don't know
three years old i i started dealing with a lot of words as well so to make my mother understand what
things were going on because she couldn't speak any english i i i had to learn a lot of vocabulary
and a lot of ways to make her understand what was going on so i paid a lot of attention to words as
well i haven't read read as much as you but i've been um very observant i observe things and i do
you know like life gives you the opportunity to be in the right place with the right person
for some unknown reason and certain books fall into your hand and you're like oh where did this come from
so that's been like so much in my life and and uh so i never questioned the fact that today i'm gonna
learn something new today i'm gonna something's gonna happen so um i want to talk a little bit about
what it is that captures people because we when we uh first um recently we conceived of getting
together and making this recording i think uh the idea was that we would kind of the idea was that
we would talk about ideas um yes and you know i had an experience that was very profound and quite
shocking and it lasted a long time it lasted for many months um during 2002 and that experience began
with me writing i was writing an essay i was sort of on fire out of the blue i was inspired i just
started writing and i thought for the first time i had sort of a vision if you will or or an idea
and the idea was that the network of human minds on our world is an environment just like the earth is
an environment right this network is an invisible environment it's a layer of what's going on here
that we can't see directly but we see its effects and in that environment there are things a bit like
organisms except they're not alive and unlike organisms
they are extremely darwinistically competitive and they compete for dominance over terrain in this in
this network of minds and they compete for dominance over the transports between minds
the transports the transports that connect humans to ideas and they compete for reproductive uh resources
just like you were talking about earlier right and they are really most of them they're not all
malignant but the dominant ones are malignant they're not like organisms they're more like cancer
right they want to metastasize and mutate and just continue their dominance and this is one way of
thinking about it's not the only way i'm not even saying this is real i'm just saying it's useful to think like
this um this is one way to think about what it is that captures humans and creates this the monumental
problems that we face in modernity these things we call nations corporations the military industrial complex
um you know uh political and religious ideologies these are these things which i i have you know i call
them thrisps right call them thrisps um and when i had this idea the moment that i had this idea about the thrisps
at that moment something touched my mind and just started teaching me incredible things about language
and knowledge and the history of human minds and all these things i'm not going to launch into a long
discussion of that i just want us to notice that it is as if certain forms of ideological structure
dominate the network of human minds and they capture they colonize the humans and then those humans go and
colonize living places and human peoples and destroy them right and turn them into slaves graves
banknotes gold you know square things cars war guns pornography advertising you name it oh yeah oh yeah so so the the thing with me is is this
bridge between languages and then i i i finally you know i get the courage to move and and and learn
as much as i can about civilizations and what was here before before uh the spaniards because well they
they did their utterly best to erase as much as the old civilization but guess what the people
are still are still here they're still here they're breathing they're walking and they have all their
baggage with it including my grandmother my uncles and all these other people that i have been very
privileged to um enjoy and it and that move was like the best thing i could have done and and so many people
criticized me and said like how can you disdain modernity and all the the comforts of life that
the the united states works really hard to provide their citizens and you you how dare you go off into the
wilderness and that you know uh who knows what the hell's going on in the other side of uh the the
the the colorado river the rio bravo they don't care they're just scared that's where the world ends
and i would i would talk to people because my my mother and my sisters and everybody stayed in los
angeles except me i decided no no no no no let let's go explore let's go find out let's let's learn let's
learn and then i found the language uh the the native language and then i i keep discovering things that
are just fantastic and of course the spirits in everything you know people here have the habit of
talking to things you know they'll say like where are you i know you're here i i know i left you here
somewhere they're talking to the broom or something you know and i realized that there we go again the
transmutation i can turn into the broom and appear to the person and say i'm outside come outside and
i can hear the broom calling me you're you're looking in the wrong place i can hear the broom
calling me hey no you're looking in the wrong place come outside that is communication that idea
that it's possible really bothers a lot of people they don't want to know oh no you must be some sort of
which how dare you you can't communicate with things not with rocks not with water not nothing you are
just this blob of amino acids and extreme and small extremities that's it that's what you are
don't try to be anything other than that well see that that's part of the um
um that's part of the domination strategy of this this thing right and it's not the left hemisphere
it's weird it's like it's like the ghost of of the left hemisphere's origin in the right hemisphere
in its nature right it's like this it's like a ghost and and part of what it does is it tells you
what's impossible and what's impossible is anything it can't control commodify enslave grip and manipulate
like a tool all that stuff is impossible so telepathy is impossible healing each other is impossible
right dreaming you really shouldn't do that don't do that don't what are you doing that's that's crazy
making don't be dreaming don't have vision how dare you don't stop perception right i call it perception
very much because mind you architecture was something you know there's these huge churches here and every
single church here uh cathedral size there was a whole civilization around that they just
split the stones and turned it into a church but right there there was a whole civilization and and
it didn't go away they just tore it apart and created their their their cathedrals and what happened
and so people would not uh run from from from these uh miners and all these people that were mining
places and they needed the people to to to uh provide for them whatever so so that uh they needed to keep
the people under control and so they said okay well we'll just let things go in in in a certain point
where we can manipulate them to the point where they're they're not uh they're not harassing us
back they won't kill us but they were always suspicious that we did not want to be conquered we
did not want to be colonized we did not want to be uh invaded by the silliness of of looking for gold and
silver and thinking that's that's it that's what you do that's that's it that's what you do accumulate
this stuff and so it's very bizarre to to to our culture yet a lot of people start taking on the
same habits the habits of lying the habits of pretending they're better than the other ones well
you're you're you're poor you know you you can't afford this or you can't afford that and so this
this thing it starts growing in in the middle of everything in this in the jungles and and they're
being poisoned by these freaking uh mercenaries have no skills no ideas no personal ideas of course because
they're disconnected and for the rest of people like you and me who will have a connection especially
to creatures like birds and animals and little things insects we feel rich we feel uh incredibly well
and and the wellness comes from just being open so there's another feature of the perverse
shadow that dominates the world and it is the idea of an individual
right you're a separate person you're the important thing your soul is at risk
and we've got the formula for immortality for your soul we're going to keep we can keep you alive forever
upstairs in god after death right if you just you know it's weird because they've got they've got this
thing that that reinforce they've got a a sort of a a protocol or a program that reinforces our
separateness as in our value is darren which is the worst part of me right the darren part of me the part
that's really concerned with darren and darrenness and all the stuff that's nothing like what the
goodness of me is right the goodness of me is way beyond darren it doesn't care much about darren
darren's a sort of a peripheral thing like i don't know like the dustpan is to my kitchen or something
right the dustpan has a purpose but it's not the kitchen anyway so the first thing is the separate
thing and then the second thing is you're either us or them you're either with us or the enemy
right if you're the enemy uh-huh yeah you're gonna burn right you're gonna go to hell so their version
of collectivity is fundamentally poisonous i just want to mention one brief thing about this bizarre
people of the book problem right and particularly i mean the jew you know the torah is one thing the
new testament we can think of it as a separate thing a new testament thing is very very strange
and there's a bunch of weird interpretations of that thing but one of the things that happened is
there were a bunch of traditions in greece right in greece and in other places in the middle east
that had to do with undergoing death while you were alive so that your passions
right your capacity to be captured by desire died and you were introduced to the virtues of origin
so that when you were resurrected in this lifetime while you're still you now you would be oriented by
this relationship with these virtues and you could not be frightened by human authorities you could not be
frightened by war or death or threats of any kind because you had seen beyond the veil of life
you knew what you knew essentially what we come from why we're here and where we go and how that
happens each person perhaps uniquely and so there were these uh mystery religions like the elicinian
religions of greece right where they would literally take you through an initiation um you
would have an experience of death and just at the at the edge when you could you know when if you're
left alone you're gonna you're gonna actually die they could resurrect you and bring you back into your
human experience and this was stolen by the idea of christianity and projected into after you die right
you only get resurrection if you accept the blood of jesus and you become a christian and they switch the
word eternity you will you you will uh this is this life is nothing you're here to be tested for the
next life right right that's where that's that's where they play the tricky part the tricky part is
we decide if you will be uh a candidate candidate because we can we can situate you in limbo for a
eternity yeah and you will never never go beyond that limbo because that's part of your punishment
for not being just like we want you right yeah so there's these conditions always creating the
conditions to obliterate your possibilities there is no possibility we decide the possibilities you just
get to obey and wish for you know that other eternity who knows when because maybe you might be dumped and
in and you know the the dante uh situation of of all these infernos it's not just one little place
it's like seven different right seven different tiers um so this is the other thing right uh
these religions utilize fear and judgment now i'm not saying there's nothing resembling evaluation
in the in the sort of origin world there's nothing resembling i don't know karma i'm i don't claim to
know about that but what i do know is that it's very unlikely that if there's something like god
um that it's like a fiercely severe jealous judging hateful punishing vicious evil being
that just seems wild right when i look at nature how convenient right right how convenient when i look
at nature that's not what i see that's not what the sun does that's not what the moon does the forest is
not doing that the animals are not doing that i'm not saying they don't eat each other and stuff like
that they do but overall if i just look in nature i rarely see violence when i look at humans i always
see violence so there's a big difference there um but my point is uh they made the divine into something
terrifying and terrible something you should fear and cower from and i will say that in my own experience
of the divine whatever that may be in whatever however that may be valued the thing that is fearful
about the divine about origin it is not its judgment what is fearful about origin
is it is so explosively beautiful that you will die of ecstasy by interacting with it you will die you
will expire of joy that's what's frightening about it it's not violent or judgmental or like the thunder
thing i mean it's it's ever more ecstatically beautiful in each moment that you interact with
it it's like an explosion of ecstasy of ecstatic loving joyful beauty which is nothing like i call it
i call it the state of grace yeah fair enough when you enter that state of grace it is non-stop you you're
in a state of grace and and there's many ways of entering there are many doors to that state of grace
and and and yes grace is something divine it's funny because um
um there's something very important that has become i've become aware of it over the past few
years as i explore more deeply my concerns with the origins of injustice and the problems with the
humans in modernity and it has to do a lot one of the features of it has a lot to do with absences
and strangely that word again absences oh absences right absences especially absences that present as
presences but there's something i notice which i think is quite profound and that is that
the way in which the divine may be palpably absent in our experience is expressed as beauty
and love and kindness it's like the absence of the explicit presence of the divine expresses itself
as like the glorious flowering beauty of any organism or living place right whereas this other absence
that is very upset about that kind of absence right because that's an absence that
is it's mystically sacredly absent right and this other absence can never do anything like that so it
wants all that stuff gone that stuff has to go away by at any cost like as soon as you can just kill it
just kill it off um and what what mcgilchrist in his book was argued was suggesting was that you know
in our minds the right hemisphere interrupts the fictions of the left right it it's watching when the
left starts to confabulate a fake world and it'll interrupt that and cause that to all break down
so that it has to be remade hopefully better than last time when the right hemisphere is shut down or
missing is stroke yeah you're you're you're breaking up you're breaking up a little bit
okay my i think my my my internet was um broken
no but you know what you were saying about absences lacking lacking lacking when something's lacking it's
it's a sense of starvation and just channeling all these things that are moving
and i feel even have uh seeds and make more little
the others are lacking you know they're looking for
they're looking for abilities i don't know if you remember that movie of amadeus
and salieri the the the guy that was there oh
okay i can't i think you stopped the video i stopped the video because it was so broken
uh and now that i've stopped it we can hear each other i'll start it back up in a moment
okay well but it's still being recorded that's all right you can leave it like that before the part
before where you started talking about amadeus was very broken so i'm not sure if that got recorded
i wonder if you might re-say it and then and then what i was saying was about the lacking
i was talking about when things are lacking uh the absence that you you name it you call it absence i i
call it lacking where where there's not enough uh energy or light or whatever it is to instigate the ability to
and it goes the other way feels it from other places you know like uh protons and and neutrons you know
they come together with other molecules and they will share their their uh electrons and and create a new uh element
element right so i think everything is in a state of constant creation yet when there isn't enough
electrons to go around and and the the energy dissipates
what's little left is is always yearning to steal from other people whatever they can and they don't care
about the quality they don't care about the quality and and that's when i uh that image of uh salieri
and that movie uh amadeus is very interesting because he has this little dialogue with uh god and and and
and he takes the cross and and he's talking to god that you know is angry at god because how dare you create
this creature uh that has so much talent and that he's only you know like in a prison suffering and watching uh
god speak through the talent of of this mozart to the point where he uh decides to destroy uh god's
a nice little creature talented creature and that's that's i i remember that so well
as do i it's a common okay it's it's a common uh can you see me now i can but still um the quality is
very poor so something is wrong with the uh with the connection all right so for the moment let us
continue without video okay i'll turn off my video unless we want to try to reconnect
um at least this way we can hear
okay well um do you want to comment something about what i just said and and yes yes it's very
similar i find i find it really really important i do too um but it's tragic for everyone involved
uh as i said before one of those wolves is infinitely hungry and the other wolf
is easily satiated by even a small morsel of food right and this is important and i think there's
something very tricky about these wolves identities um if we think of one of the wolves as a
we think of one of the wolves as an absence and the other one is a presence or one is lacking
and one is plentiful i think if we actually look very carefully at the wolves we will discover
that the hungry wolf the infinitely hungry wolf isn't actually a wolf at all he's the other wolf's right
call right he's like one extension of the of the good wolf
and he's trying to be a wolf and he can't
now normally it's not a problem right to be the right hand of a being
but if that hand wanted to dominate the whole body and was really angry and tried to attack for
example my face or my torso or something right then you would see a phenomenon similar to what we are
what we are witnessing you know what if what if molieri was actually a feature of mozart
it could be it can be you know that uh that dark side that we all have i i always uh had this thing
with my kids when you know they they're fighting or doing something stupid and i said okay you two
better shape up and they're and they keep going right and they said okay kids you you guys don't
want to know my dark side because my dark side's rarely dark and that's when they stopped then that's
when they stopped okay mom uh we believe you we believe you we'll stop they they think they're
playing they're doing harm and they don't know how much you know somebody's going to poke somebody's
eye out or do something really stupid whatever it is i'm trying to avoid it but then i i call my dark
side to lurk and and and and show a small little bit of how dark my dark side is and and they don't
want to know they don't want to know so yes yes we are both at the same time you know the um
what what mcgill chris is arguing is that our cult what we call our cultures which are not actually
societies they are like left hemispheric style constructs that have no right hemispheric aspect
that can correct them at all right so they're just they're doing the thing you were talking about
earlier they're trying to arrange their own death but no one's coming to kill them that's what they're
doing you see it's the same yeah yeah i could see it i've seen it so many times i've seen it so many
times and and uh people say oh no no you're you're you're miss misinterpreting and no i'm not
misinterpreting uh that's something that i have not just the skill but and the intuition but it's just
like a hundred percent of everything i do this is very important um when i
you want me to turn on my camera yeah we'll try and see if that we'll see
you know the the thing about how much of a coward a person can be i want to turn it off again yeah i
want to i want to make sure that at least our communication is clear you know i don't think
it's cowardice i think it's something weirder i think it's like a soullessness
right their soul has gone dim so it's not just it's not cowardice it's a kind of a vulnerability
perhaps what do you think
well i i i really think there's like six elements working here and and one of the i mean there's like
on the positive side the the positive sensible common sense fortitude is um the ability to learn
the ability to uh have initiative so that you move outwards you know you have this force that goes
forward uh despite many odds and then there's the admiration because you've seen it in other people
or in other things that that all three of those elements create this force a benevolent force that will
carry just about anything into action into a benign state or the state of grace once those three
elements are here but their counterparts what are the counterparts of of uh admiration is envy so the sense
of envy that and and i'm not talking people that are jealous because you know the difference between
being jealous and being uh envious is is a great deal i mean if you're jealous it's like you know
see somebody with a nice car you know if you work hard you can buy that nice car but if you see somebody
with certain attributes let's say a good voice you know that no matter how much you practice you're never
going to have that voice and so yeah so i admire people with a beautiful voice and i and i don't envy them
because that's something i will never have yet i have my own talents but when when it comes to uh
being dependent or uh reliable i'd rather be reliable and than dependent
so said other people depend on me because i think i can uh do what i what i say i'm going to do
but the opposite of dependent is useless oh i can't do this i can't do that you know they they they
dig their own grave because they're just like no i can't oh i'm too afraid or this so so they they
create the situation where you're saving them and they're hanging on to you and so those dependent
people can be really really negative because they're always nagging about something right so that's
that's the opposite of uh learning right you say well i don't know but i can learn and i just need
practice the more i practice the better i'm going to get at it but that other person's going to say oh
no i can't do it so what happens with the controller the person with initiative the one who's like the
politicians who talk and talk and blab and lab uh they don't have the skill set but what they do have
is that they recognize the the ability to to go forward they're going to need the other two
but then they will depend on people with those other skills but what does the other controller the
negative controller is the destroyer you know no nothing can exist except me me and me alone
because if somebody sees somebody else they're going to compare them and of course i'm never going
to be as good and and all three uh uh situations the envy uh the belittlement of of self is going to
pop up and and and reinforce the sense of i'm bad but i'm incredibly bad and nobody's going to know
just how bad i am and so they have to be like incredibly bad and every day you know they'll have
children and they'll teach them oh you're going to have to learn to cheat this is how you cheat and you
and if i catch you that means you didn't learn to cheat right you know there's all these fables about uh
kings teaching their their uh their children how to be evil which is really silly um well that's how i
feel that there's the counterparts that are working against this uh this other uh trinity of of uh skills
and and the other ones are just plain lazy you know laziness and postponing and you know even
magical thinking or positive thinking for that matter which is a whole school of psychology
positive thinking which i think is horrible because i think the the capacity of us to see the horrors
is also important yes i agree you can uh yes we should not um that you just think everything's
nice and rosy all the time i mean on the one hand okay this these matters are very complex and they're
not easily encompassed in simple um proclamations or simple declarations i want to say a few things
though that relate to the history of the conversation that we've been having today and one of them is
that um it seems to me that the elements that represent the absence of our humanity they're very
good at organizing they can organize um incredibly effectively so that they don't have to not be lazy
they can get away with lazy evil because there's fifteen thousand of them doing it together
right so they can get away with being lazy and evil um and again i'm not sure that that it's actually
people right it's like depersonized humans it's dehumanized people you know if you go to a job
every day even a job that isn't necessarily evil right you go work in an office you're sitting in front
of a computer at a rectangular desk everything around you is rectangular it's all a bunch of squares
there's some fluorescent lights above your head killing your soul every moment that you're there
it's basically like one of those tears of dante's hell right it's a terrifying thing and so what
happens is the people become dead inside and then they just um they enact the functions i remember
writing a poem a long time ago when i was in a poetry class about the disappeared in guatemala after seeing
um a show about this on television and being so moved by it and one of my friends in the class turned
to me and said you don't understand evil darren i was like what do you mean like evil isn't it's not a
thing inside people when they interviewed those people who killed and buried the people in guatemala
those people weren't evil when they asked them why they did it they didn't say because i love torturing
humans they said i did it because i was just following orders i was just doing what i was told i was doing
what i was told to do by the guys above me and here we come back to this uh
uh we come back to the hierarchy right hierarchy of human power um
so yeah i think that my video is too it's probably too high res let me see here one second yeah i can
make the video a little bit less my runs i'm i'm fine it comes and goes it's it's a little unstable but
uh yeah you're very blurry on my end so i'm gonna i'm gonna give up my bandwidth for the moment um
all right so we'll see how it how it records yeah i'm gonna stop your video too because it looks pretty
choppy um so we'll just do it this way for the moment maybe wait for a second yeah it looked bad yeah
there we go all right so the thing is there is something like culture and there is something
like society but it's not the big culture in the big society that we that we think of when we use
these words it's like when you go to the poor people in some city or village and you get some of them
together to start making art that is culture you get some of them together and you teach them new
skills and they learn them together for each other with you that is a society that's what a society
looks like not like this other job right not like the enacting of a bunch of dead inside rules what do you think
well of course um i i don't know if i ever uh told you but uh back in 2008 i i started teaching a um art
class in skid row over there in los angeles and uh the police precinct there asked me if i would uh give all
these uh people uh something to do and i and i said what do you mean is that well they they need
to pay their tickets but so they have to do a social service but we have no social service for them
to do could you could you uh take them as your students or something or do something with them
and i'm like well i'm gonna need tables and chairs and paper and oh no no we'll give you absolutely
everything you need and so this community which is skid row it's a it's a it's an important community
mind you there's people that have been living there for 20 30 years and there's new covers every day
of course now it's grown exponentially uh but back then it was pretty big it was like uh maybe
17 000 people were in that area uh camping at some given time and they all had all sorts of issues
but the main issue is that they had to do their social service and so what i did as an art teacher
i told them you know and as soon as everybody arrives just have this piece of paper and write your name
on one of the corners whichever corner you like doesn't matter just write your name and we'll get
started and then once the people gathered i would tell them okay we're going to do these uh series of
drawings and lines and so on and some people were very can't do this and i thought did you write your name
on the piece of paper and they said yes of course well that is a drawing and they they they would just
go cathartic because they like what and i yeah you drew your name the word written writing
is is is just another form of uh name on a piece of paper you can draw the lines and you can draw the
whatever and the thing is i would um give them a a little series of exercises and then i would have
them turn the page and draw the person in front of them and they did it and they could but it was a
funny little thing happening right there derrick the person that they drew was themselves with the
features of the other person in front of them say they had a little hat or thick eyebrows but the face
all the whole drawing was them what are you looking at what are we seeing oh well it's a picture of him
with uh with a mustache or something and it's like wait wait a minute what's going on here and i said well
thing is that we have been trained not to look at others we have not been allowed to look at it into each
other's eyes and observe the person in front of us what we see is the person in the mirror when we brush
our teeth that's who we know we know the guy or the lady that's in front of the mirror and that's all
we know so of course you're going to draw a face that looks like yours but this time i'm going to give
you a new sheet of paper and this time we're going to study the face and he's going to study
your face and she's going to study your face and we're going to observe carefully and you're not going
to take your pencil until i say so you're going to spend 15 minutes studying the features on the person
in front of you and it's okay because so you can try them so you're going to check and see just how
far their eyes are apart how big is their jaw and then i gave them a little bit of advice and then they
drew everybody there every single person made a portrait of the person in front of them exactly
with the features that they had to and that was a two hour session okay so the ability of people to
change and to turn into a community and to acquire new skills is something i did every saturday
right there in downtown los angeles see this is what i'm speaking about so you gave those
together with those people you all experienced something that would seem impossible right i'm
sure none of those very few of those people who you were working with probably thought that they could
actually make a portrait of someone who's in front of them i think they probably thought they could not
do that that's that's not possible um and yet you gave them a direct experience of doing something
that shouldn't be possible that they thought was impossible and you gave it to them you gave them
this together right they they were doing it together not just one on one one person you know everybody had
to do their social service and and here's the the crazy thing because well these are all adults and
they're not you know not well all sorts of uh bad habits whatever you sure their health it might not be
good their mental state definitely crazy of course and uh some of them would you know be really nasty
like oh well how how is this uh a social service how is this going to be make anything better and then i
would say don't you see don't you see you just taught your hand to respond to something your eyes looking
at that created this little channel inside your nervous system where all your muscles are are
concentrating on that pencil and that paper to proceed relating something you're looking at
and they would still like say so what so what what so what if i learned to do that and i said see
from now on you can train your eye to see your problems and now you can solve any problem because now
you can see it now you can see it before we were not taught to see anything like you mentioned so many
times people don't see the squares everywhere right they're everywhere but they don't see them
because they're not taught to see things and it would just bring tears to their eyes because i would
say now you can create the life you want and you need and solve your problems and that makes you a better
person see you teach them something better people this is a better world you teach them something about
the connection between their capacity to see and their capacity to act and their capacity to do something
beautiful with their hands and that connection that three that three-way connection is in a sense what
you were talking about earlier when you spoke of transmutation
yeah that's the proof they've got the proof in their hand they've got it and the person in front of
them is like you made my portrait and sometimes they would exchange portraits i mean it was so
a cathartic to the whole class everybody was just really happy and they would return and they would
give me updates on their lives and it was just a lot of fun but it's something that allows people
instantly to take control to learn to see because we've been so damaged like you said these vibrating
lights and all this disconnection how can they connect well they just have to let go for a moment
and and they were obligated on top of that this was an obligation this was a civil service obligation they
had to be there they wore their sunday best and they had no idea what they were getting into
and something really beautiful here and this is one of the things that i've i always have um
respected and loved about you is that uh you know you are a really beautifully hearted human being and
woman and oh thank you i've always uh felt very privileged to know you and to see um the beauty in
your heart and your skillfulness and your art um and i still feel this way today but one of the things
i just want to mention is that you were mothering those people natalia you were mothering them they may
have been adults you were like being um like one of the people who might guide
you across the river left they after you die right but except you were guiding them back across the
other way you were guiding them to an anamnesis to a resurrection of their humanity and their spirit
and their capacity to heal themselves and each other and meanwhile they're asking how is this a social
service what i'm just drawing pictures right yet you can see that this art is medicine and is powerful
and is beautiful and profound
and i just think that's it it's really it's really important what you're saying because
everybody has the capacity to be awful or to be wonderful it just it's always there it's always there
but it's also very painful to be decrived
of our humanity
and our spirit and our origin and our mothers and our fathers and our living places
and our siblings and our honor and our creativity and that that's what leads to addiction
the the humans are trying to replace something
that is absolutely crucial to their existence and has been essentially vampirically stolen
now i'm not saying they have no role in its loss but it's very easy to become
to become absent to oneself and one's potential once enough of what is crucial has been sucked away by
our by the opposite of what i would call culture
and so one of the things i love about the story that you just told
is in a way you're just doing i think what comes naturally to you you're playing um you're doing
like the thing that the woman in greece who initiates people into the mysteries and she leads them through
the death and resurrection thing you're doing something that actually resembles that you're resurrecting them
um in the midst of los angeles right you don't have the ancient greek temples and stuff to to lean
on right all you've got is some tables and paper and maybe some you know art supplies
but that's really beautiful and i i just um i want to celebrate the spirit with which you have brought
humans and places back to life through your art and your love and your thank you thank you that that
that's um i i welcome uh the kind words because sometimes uh we get so involved in in giving and
doing and and appreciation is always welcome i think it's very important to to do what we're doing
right now because i'm sure there's going to be people listening to this and i'm sure there's hundreds
of artists out there thousands of artists that if they did that what i did that that little exercise
in their community or maybe on thanksgiving or between their siblings and uh i don't know go places and
and do just that little exercise and give people back their sight and their ability to see reality
yeah i think reality is fabulous i'm not saying there's no horror stories in it there's tons of horror
stories in it but what but without the beauty without the ability to see and open open people's
eyes and and you mentioned it many times how can we get together well they don't see each other
that's why they don't get together they can't they can't get together because they've been taught
to ignore absolutely everything and around them and especially people they they run away from people
they're always scared they watch so much television so much stupid things i mean i i had a production
company at at one point in my life and i realized how important it is to produce the right content
to get to stimulate in a positive way and i i always wanted to have an animation company and i didn't i
and now now that the the chat gpt thing is just moving right along taking everything it can and i think
it's too bad it doesn't have any ideas there that's such a pity i wish they did
so there's there's something i want to share about this again there's a problem where um
all right see when you and i come together i i am lucky in that i am aware of a lot of the features
of our possible humanity that we may not commonly experience um and one of the things i would point out
is that for one thing i i love the humans i'm not a misanthrope right which a lot of intellectuals are
they criticize the humans i'm really sad about what happens to the humans at their large collective
scales but i actually love the humans and i believe in them as an organism the earth has invested more in
humans than probably in any other organism that is a complex one anyway i mean the amount of investment
that it takes to just keep the humans alive is unimaginable moment to moment um and probably
unsustainable well it's probably not unsustainable to keep the humans alive but it's unsustainable to
keep a billion machines going that's for sure um that's for sure yeah i agree with you yeah yeah i mean
everybody's arguing like there's too many humans well actually there's too many objects
right um there's you know seven billion cars or something and 12 trillion guns and who knows what
but anyway um so the humans they are like uh
okay the humans are a topology there's amazing humans and there's amazing groups of humans and then
there's really bad groups of humans that are you know deprived and like the like the bad wolf or whatever
or the hungry wolf but there are a bunch of problems that are really simple we're not
shown features of the nature of our humanity and we're trained to a colonizing mindset that poses us as
individuals what do i get what is take what's being taken from me that's what molieri was upset about
molieri didn't thank god for producing a mozart in his lifetime who he could study and learn from and
adore and enjoy right which would be just as natural a reply to the existence of mozart as any other reply
i would argue molieri decided that he was alone he was a separate person and what i'm reminded of is
a sort of a fairy tale that i made up where
there was a world that was made for birds
but there weren't any birds on that world what there were were separate wings
and they flapped around on the ground a lot complaining
and and they had stories of flight but none of them ever flew because they never put two of them
together and formed a bird between them and i think our nature is to actually be thus we are an animal
that needs each other to explore and discover and to block to like fertilize and to nurture
our humanity it's not a thing of individuals it's not a thing of separate persons and when you and i
come together to speak and explore and learn and remember every time we do this we make a beautiful
bird together right my you join your wing to my wing i join my wing to your wing and there's a bird
between us and it's the bird of concern for our planet and for the people and for the sky and for the living
places and the animals and the creatures and everything everything alive right it's this really beautiful
spirit right and i believe in that bird and i i don't believe in the individual
and on top of that there's there's this thing about feminine and and masculinity that i can never think
like a man and and and i tried because i had two two precious sons and and they're they they're both
boys they're they're with their boyish ideas but i discovered this masculinity was was uh
threatened by their own masculinity i mean men against men that was something
i couldn't i couldn't understand and and it keeps uh you know your point of view enriches so much of the
things that i can't perceive because of my femininity that is uh just i can't stop it that's who i am
you know because my essence is this uh like you said mothering non-stop nurturing is is just something
that uh comes out in an in without any effort i mean it's effortless i don't have to think oh i should
do this in fact i want to say something here that's going to scare people but i don't think i think i just
do and it just pops up nothing and ideas pop up in my head i i can't say i thought about them they just
pop inside my head and and like in architecture i i can see the building already finished inside my head
before i even start drawing and and those that's why i can't say i think or i believe
because the things just pop in my head they're they're already there or when you say something
immediately something uh this association or the capacity to associate so many things like we were
talking earlier about the scary movies or the uh captain nemo i mean we're gonna have to talk about
captain nemo because i have a lot of stories around this whole thing i want to do that yeah theses uh
what was a little was was related to an ocean city so we'll talk about that some other time
darren we will but i wanted to get you started talking about words meaning yes yes okay your masculine
focus on this whole uh aspect which is i find uh find important and i find that i need to learn from you
all these uh sounds and vibrations and uh yeah you got a lot of uh things up your sleeve that i want
you to share so okay i want to go back over a few of the things you just said and one of them was that
you thought it would be frightening if you told people that you don't think and i'd just like to
suggest something here that i have recently discovered so first of all i don't usually think
either the stuff that i write it's not because i thought it i wasn't sitting there trying to figure
something out like a math problem and when i draw or when i write or when i make music whatever it is
i'm doing i'm not thinking and also i would argue that we moderns we are very confused about what minds
are for and and i'm gonna suggest that minds are not for thinking
minds are for communion minds are for coming together and making a third way of seeing that
is both of our hearts and our spirits join together in a beautiful mission that our ancestors and our
children would be proud of minds are for that thinking is what happens to minds when they're
being tortured by being isolated and separate then you have the mulieri problem
then you have
it's it's it's it's salieri salieri salieri my bad yes thank you for correcting me salieri yeah
that's the character no no no just just wanted no that's an important correction
yes that you're saying molieri is another is another character from another uh correct
yes my my mistake i'm getting old i've been here for about uh two two hours
we we should get together again and yes yes we will wind down soon yes let me know when when you're
available i will we will wind down momentarily i just want to share a few and wind down and uh
i adore yes please the way you enact your femininity and i adore your spirit and way in the world and i
honor and respect uh this about you i think you're just a beautiful being and i'm so grateful to learn
with you and see with you and hear your experiences and your insights um it's it's really a treasure
i'm so grateful for this time together we will do this again sometime very soon
um and i'm happy to hear anything you care to share before we we wind down for today
well uh it's been a great pleasure every time uh we've uh encountered a few words and uh maybe we'll
make it a habit of uh doing this i um i admire so much the way you manage to create uh all sorts of
things it's just uh i i really i really uh you've always inspired me a lot to keep going you don't
know this because i i don't express it enough but it's uh it is the the the world of ideas is the world of
words and if we don't use the words properly we can fall into that category of uh misunderstanding
or misinterpreting so much so much so that people uh taint their life with uh um this sense of
hopelessness and i think your work is full of hope constant and uh radiating with this sense of
togetherness and hope that is is out there and uh it's being obliterated by so many forces but you know
like i said they don't want to know my dark side because i will use my light side with my dark side
to approach and uh set them straight because this is too much too much they're getting on my nerves
i understand and yes we should fear the anger of the mothers i think we will soon be subjected to
some of it as humans because we've been as a species we've been wildly misbehaving in the nursery for a long
time now i think there will be some answer to that i hope there will be some answer
natalia you're amazing i'm so grateful thank you time i'm grateful as well thank you darren it's
really really really uh a wonderful talk and we have to do this more often all right we will do this
again very soon i hope that you have a beautiful rest of your time there and i wish you wise dreams and
amazing experiences same here take care you too bye-bye for now
bye-bye till next time my friend till next here yes
