this is an episode of death
shout out i'm here with my dear friend
amazing to be here with you um so while we have this time we've been trying to do this forever
we'll probably do at least one or two more of these great so we don't have to get it all yeah
thanks for having me yeah yeah totally love you how did we meet we met in a chat room online
when i was 16 which means it would have been 2001. the website was deoxy.org which is
short for the deoxy ribonucleic hyperdimension dimitri was the uh
master of ceremonies really i i'd only hung out in the chat room maybe for a couple weeks by the way
it would have had to have been at least sometime after may 2002 but let's keep going
yeah maybe you're right i wasn't there before then okay i don't think i might have been no you're
right you're right it would have been closer maybe 2004 yeah i graduated high school so great um
um yeah i that site was sort of an amalgamation of psychedelic literature idioms spirituality
non-ordinary experiences and everything was kind of connected like a wiki but it seemed like it was
all written by one person there was a russian guy named dimitri remember his last name i used to know it
there were there were a couple things like this i it was just i feel like if you were attracted to
any of those things it was well known popular because it was very well done it was very put
together i got introduced to a lot of thinkers psychonauts weirdos in that space and free sauce
big time in in the footer of every page was the same connect like chat room
mm-hmm so it was web-based you didn't have to have irc nothing yeah so you could pop in there any
time and see who was rambling about whatever that's right and you were there arguing with
someone about go pantywag some aspect of biology yeah it was almost certainly go pantywag he was a
guy who was trolling me all the time okay um william used to attack him very severely and
uh you know curse him to the seventh deaths of the 19th hell and so forth yeah so i started engaging
you pretty quickly pulled me aside into your irc we only shadowed from the organ now maybe like 30
minutes to an hour and then you said hey would you be interested in moving this to voice and i said
absolutely and so we talked on the phone for a few hours and then i think i was i was very intrigued
and so i started reading your work but then i was kind of intimidated and so i felt like i needed to
take all of it in before i felt like i could talk to you again and so i read through all of it once
took forever because it's very dense you're talking with that i mean hundreds of pages
i mean with hundreds of pages um yeah and some of those are more comprehensive to me than others
i'm still pretty young and um just not not not informed uh and and then so then a whole one year
went by and then i called you again and then i can create a more semi-regular relationship until 2007
i came to san francisco and stayed with you for a few days and i bounced i remember each year i went to
burning man i would come try to come through here and see you yeah i don't know how much that you
remember how you remember it yeah that's beautiful um deoxy was a crazy mess and pretty profound
you had your own pretty vibrant irc community people that tried it it was small it was like you know
eight to ten people yeah regulars yeah i ran the domain out of this place on the one
one of the xbox that's in the closet over there called the bath trope cool um but yeah that matches
with my memory um i have so many million questions for you so what's the least worthy question to
entertaining consciousness what you're asking me yeah what's the dumbest thing you've ever seen
you think about think about yeah talk about dude whatever what's fucking completely not worth your time
whatever they aren't yeah um
yeah the weather until you know i mean there's a there's a spectrum i mean we're about to be hit by a
no no yeah i don't mean the climate um i mean like whatever's happening whatever's gonna happen
an hour from now that doesn't really isn't really gonna affect us on a deep level so
um what are some of the dumbest ideas you've ever encountered dumbest ideas i'm looking i want to
look in your guard i want to see in your garden yeah in the garbage bin yeah oh uh gosh i feel like
i have there's one i'm trying to remember um i think i think the big bang is pretty dumb
um yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean hilariously dumb yeah yeah we agree when like when i try to think
of the most unlikely improbable impossible thing it's the big bang i am borrowing this from terence
mckenna but he riffs it a lot better than i do which by the way was a huge part of the
originary influence for deoxy yeah he was all over it yeah he was all that's probably how i found it
as i was looking for more yeah yeah it was it was a mckenna it was basically a mckenna church yeah
little playland stuff it's yes on the internet and john lily timothy leary yeah yeah sure yeah i mean
lily i i think he's trippy he himself up academy like many other people have did it permanently affect
him i think i think he's starting to have trouble putting sentences together i i don't know
i don't know the timeline i mean i read it's been so long since i read his autobiography but
he did so many things so many things yeah the guy was seriously trippy i mean he's the i'm pretty sure
he's the um the source concept for the movie altered states yes based on him yeah yeah yeah he invented the
the isolation tank he gave us the dolphins yeah did ketamine for like 100 days in a row when that was
novel he did all kinds of other things which is the scientist i think he i think he had a rough
i think he had a rough last season to put it mildly from what i've heard but i i don't actually know
i don't know he's somebody i'm a fan of though um i love his book um i've got a couple of his books in my
room one of them i brought back to my dad's house because i bought it from my dad yeah book on
communicating dolphins okay i haven't read that one man when i was a kid jacuisto and dolphins and
whales and stuff looks like i mean it was the psychedelics that are embedded in nature
you don't acquire drugs um in any case okay so the big bang yeah it's a pretty weird idea give me one
miracle and i'll explain the rest of the yeah easy right let a monster in the door sure and i
you don't have to give me a second monster i'll just use the first one um lots of physicists
probably agree with you they don't they don't really like that even penrose who i think is
absolutely exquisite as being in their mind roger penrose uh if you don't know him get to know him
right you'll love it um he's not happy with that idea at all uh but he likes punctuated like it's a
you know it's a heartbeat right so he came up with a theory that um must have been something before the
big bang and if there was if the big bang is real then what would have happened in the later stages of
the previous uh iteration would have been super massive black holes and they would leave a
fingerprint that we could detect across the bangs found evidence for this um what's another really
stupid thing that you see humans doing that you just really just stop doing statism and what's the
alternative that you prefer something that isn't defined by the state something that doesn't
demand people be subjugated yeah require rulers yeah so you're um if i understand correctly from
only a few previous recent conversations you're something of a volunteerist like a voluntarist
you have to talk about what that means yeah i play with the idea but i can't say i'm well reader um
um that's not versed enough to argue the you find it attractive though i do very much so this notion that
only engaging in voluntary agreements at larger scales leads to
leads to flourishing or that is more like progress other than subjugation hierarchy
violence yeah but the seem like the problem of political authority has been around for forever so
i understand why why a system that is that leverages violence and inequality exists because it's so much
more powerful and people are afraid of the challenges that are presented when they're forced to take
the personal responsibility for their own freedom in addition to the things that they want and get from
subjugating everyone so first world we get cell phones and technology and free access to incredible
amounts of deeply embedded energy uh in the earth that we just wouldn't otherwise because the negative
externalities of those are pushed out and they're only really leveraged effectively through widespread
violence against people and the natural world so yeah i just think it's connected to a whole host of problems
so and we agree about those things um it's a fundamental injustice that is unconscionable and uh sort of
agonizing at the level of my skin or you know like my bones or something right yeah the um
distribution of damage torture entropy suffering to every life system on the planet for the sake of what
um um numbers and boxes yeah yeah quantification extraction profit yeah yeah really so and higher and the um
uh the re-instructuring of hierarchic of a fictional hierarchic uh my vocabulary isn't working this that great
this late but of um fictional hierarchic structures
that both capture and captivate sort of the the lords and the prisoners but the gods and the subjugated
um fame is a really strange example of this in some way i mean fame is so weird
how many of the famous people actually enjoyed their fame what do you think i'm not sure i mean there's
a lot of fame that isn't because of something pleasant it's comes from something very negative
or dangerous or bless you like infamy yes
actually the question is not so much about fame it's about the fictional
diorama that creates it and sustains it i mean imagine the difference between like for example the
most obsessed adoring fan and the actor but they're mapping about
this universe is almost in some ways couldn't be farther apart and yet they're they generate each
other well it seems like humans have some innate desire to be observed so the pursuit of that larger
and larger scales of which currently we have unparalleled exponential access to it seems to play on
that desire yeah they have both desires to observe and be observed yeah it is fundamental to the nature
of human cognition in my work with schizophrenics and paranoids and psychotic people who actually
are some of our best friends and i think those labels are wildly outdated but are also in some cases
clinically useful um it's all of its observation uh the concept of being surveilled right you can't be
paranoid if you're not concerned that somebody's watching you someone's watching you critically you're
you're the recipient of negative observational attention that's enough that's enough to generate
like deep psychosis it it sunders the psyche suddenly that i'm receiving negative observational attention
this is what um people who don't smoke a lot of weed and then smoke some often experience right when they
say like uh the idea that they become very self-conscious actually is a kind of observational paranoia because
it can under certain circumstances and different strains do different things um it can radically amplify
features of awareness that simulate the observation of others the critical observation
and that can lead to a cascade that literally can produce seizures right we're so sensitive to this
because the our ability to remain integrated or one with the tribes what allowed us to survive in sorrow
the behaviors ideas or actions that would inhibit or threaten that i think are all they're all there
people all sorts of haters that people struggle with in the sense that they really want something or pursue
to pursue something but deep part of our brains that refuses to make that easy say more what do you mean
how does it refuse to make things i'm not quite with you now i think the simplest example would be
when men attempt to pursue women in social contexts there's a risk associated with approaching
a female and there's a lot of cultural social conditioning to not be a creep
but i think there's also a tribal basis of you know there could be another male around the corner
that's going to murder you um or threats that you can't see um because you are pursuing
what is seen as um uh the asset isn't the right word because women aren't commodities but like you're
pursuing a relationship that has implications in terms of how how the tribe progresses right because
wow the pursuit of spreading our genes yeah i mean that's the mechanics of it but there's a whole
metaphysics surrounding that too and there's a there's a poetics surrounding that as well sure
it's like um theater music or literature it's like theater and music and literature and math and myth
right it's it's and the psyche and eros right so it's it's pretty rich you know it doesn't have to be
rich yeah well but ideally it is right ideally you're walking towards something that's so beautiful it's
feels dangerous right yeah it's lethally dangerous it's potentially potentially yeah yeah i mean maybe in
some senses yeah i mean you're also in some sense as men if we are um heterosexual males uh which iids
um and i'm not afraid i don't feel like that's a yeah i think it's a controversial light position yeah
it's not a slight on who i am no um two door women is trippy in all kinds of ways and it's a it's a mythic quest
no matter how that arises in their hearts what i'm trying to get at though is that
our culture is weird in that it tends to it has for oh by the way you were saying something about
the history of politics i don't think that's as old as you think i think we're talking like
10 000 years out of a few hundred thousand years i don't think that the weird higher hierarchization
that the humans have undergone over the past few thousand years it seems i don't know i really don't
know i honestly don't the same way i don't know like the big bang is kind of nonsensical you can't we can't
even figure it out we can't figure out what humans were doing 12 000 years ago but we know what the
universe was doing 4.3 billion years ago really that's your best theory um what do you think about
the idea of asking the universe what he's doing i think it would come back only in a way the person
asking could understand it it would very likely be non-translatable because i mean the person who's
asking is in fact the universe asking right right in some ways it's recursive yeah also it's
i think it's kind of presumptuous to imagine that you could fit the waves emitted outward from the
answer into such a tiny receiver i like that so let me try to say that back to you the nature of the
answer won't fit into the vehicles that you would normally use to okay so we we are contain or
expressions of something infinite and we are surrounded by the infinite uh and i imagine in some ways it's
funny because your son was saying this to me uh recently that you know the universe may be
looking for someone to talk to and so it is progressively continually sort of evolving
things up towards it into a form of being that it can converse with oh i love that that's beautiful
well i can hold what it is enough that it can have a conversation yeah but that's pretty but that's
a lot right that's a lot what because you know it occurred to me that if god exists and we're not
talking about like the biblical god or whatever we're talking about the being or whatever the
fucking the union of all being past present and future might be something like this anyway suppose
that that exists and it's omniscient right you can see everything well there's still things you can't
see like in the same way that you and i can't see our own sea right so it might want a satellite
right that could see it and maybe even see it seeing see it's seeing um but you look non-possed
by this idea help me out well i mean i think you just take the consumption further it may it may want
to explore every possible configuration of that that there ever could be and that could be what we're
doing okay but that's trippy because that possibility space is not bounded right so that means that it's
not like if the possibility space were bounded it would be a simple solution so it would end at some
point not only would it end you wouldn't wouldn't begin right if the possibility space were bounded
15 minutes explored okay you could just compute it and so here we are here we are in one configuration
me thinking me feeling as though i am in my body and what the is that all the time all the time
doubt great doubt is almost all is very prominently
featured in humans become insightful you mean it sort of precedes that insight yeah yeah this doubt
that like what's going on right here that i know what's going on that i am me but i know what me is
it's the doubt of um i was talking about this earlier with andre in any case i have a
a billion questions for you so let's let's walk through with you um when you were a child were
there any humans that you recall that were particularly influential in your thought desire
dreaming visions of the future you wanted to be like them what was going on
i think the closest thing i had to role models were my siblings
but no real mentors no living mentors until i was a teenager uh so nobody read or saw on tv separate
yes so plenty of authors okay let's see yourself figures who was the first one you remember
it doesn't have to be first early one colin wilson wow okay how old um i was
let's say i was maybe 13 or 14 when i read the outsider yeah and uh yeah i was interested in
existentialism and i thought oh um meta analysis whatever that word meant of existentialism by a very
young person for the time and i felt like oh i don't have to read all these books i mean i can but
it's sort of a top level view of the philosophy and yeah i still have my copy i just really it was like
i had i was having an existential crisis and i found a guidebook and i and i just remember
i remember being at my friend's timeshare in florida for like a week because his parents had too much
money and that's what they did and we went to disney world and every night i was just devouring that
book while he played video games and uh yeah it was just soothing and enlightening you know and foreboding
in a way because it's you're still you still sit with the notion that doesn't mean anything doesn't
mean nothing but that's freeing somehow or painful or all this terrible shit can happen and still it's
yeah i can't uh can't really compress it because it's so long ago i remember feeling deeply uh calmed
and and excited because if there were people writing this way and doing this then and then
continuing to live oh okay okay yeah surely there are more ways to do this um i think the one then
the one right after that would be a book by my great uncle um which is called native american spirituality
so i was raised christian hardcore christian for a period and so to hear ironic to hear an indigenous person
who grew up in a boarding school and then really leaned into native american spirituality talk about
their non-ordinary experiences i thought oh okay okay all right um yeah just completely allowed me to let
that dogma go and pursue the notion that there were living relationships with things that were possible
that percus magic basically yeah i'm sent to be kind of blunt about it among other things so again
i haven't revisited that book since i was a teenager what's something that you read when you were much
younger that much younger deeply yeah when my childhood anything that you can remember if anything
i'm not trying to put it on the spot but no you're fine no books are books are formative um
yeah mostly read fiction me too but why why do you shake your head when you say that right
feels pulpy you know that even matters i remember trying to read the hobbit when i was in fourth grade
and it was a little i was like i don't kind of get yeah i think i've read that about the same age
yeah i understood the heart of it the the fellowship of the ring was too tough i had to wait a couple
years i haven't tried that two or three times before i made it through it which was very uncommon for me
the books there was no book there's one book it's a real problem problem what's wrong what was wrong with
it it was completely incomprehensible oh and the most boring and confusing thing she still yes
the bible
sorry i didn't get it yeah no oh we've got to go to catholic sermon and i'd be like hmm oh yeah okay
i tried you tried it's so important everyone's like supposedly yeah this is the most important
thing that ever yeah it's had marks on pages yep right yeah i tried and tried and i was just like
what you know josephus begat begat begat begat begat begat begat begat for a whole chapter of
kazat wik 쓰�czyć phieldég ces censten i mean i'm sure they make kid versions though kid versions
with pictures didn't have those when i ran around when i was a kid even then it was really
confusing the idea that there was like some i remember talking to my grandmother about god when i
was i don't know four or five she's like he watches over you what does that mean well he knows if you're
doing bad things what that's basically that's a recipe for schizophrenia right
there right yeah observational attention how we're gonna keep you
aligned you know yeah so if the universe if it's fundamental principle is
negative like critical observational yeah yeah right yeah hold on to that
right yeah I'll keep up it's gonna go you're gonna shatter the psyche and just
it's gonna be tattoo taboos tattoos and I don't know what BS some kind of BSDM
spirituality thing yeah a lot of segregation hierarchy authority on it I'm curious if
there's a dream you recall from your early life yeah I think the oldest one I
can recall was probably when I was five or six I think we had seen some somehow
near it I had seen Edward Scissorhands hmm but I had a dream where I was on a
table being operated on large knives like it was scary but it wasn't overwhelming
it was painful it wasn't traumatic and yeah I just stuck out I mean that leads
toward another topic potentially I don't think it's I wouldn't interpret it that
way mm-hmm but lots of people do sure they do sure they do there no yeah yeah
I'm not saying I don't only wait I don't suppose I'm that so okay so let's let's
just talk briefly about and I wasn't asking you about your dream to
interpret it okay either so I can I can add to that a little bit okay let's do it I
had a lot of dreams of dying when I was younger okay in a lot of different ways
it's true I characterized my dreaming I was 12 mm-hmm yeah by the way I'm sure
we realize so much we okay so it's very difficult to encounter other humans that
know much about dreaming you can read books yeah there are some people that
write books sure and there's plenty of interesting stuff there I haven't seen a
lot of it but I've been really curious about dreams since I was forever yeah
since I was forever yeah and to dream is to die hmm because the dreaming mind dies
every fucking morning it doesn't have a continuous life right it has a punctuated
existence so it arises lives dies and then we wake up and it's curious about why
that happens every night and it's curious about what's on the other side of that
shit the same way we're curious about that it's curious about waking up because for
the dream mind waking up is death so and for the waking mind dreaming is death so
these there's some really interesting shit here so the fact that you were
dreaming a lot about death when is sort of dreaming about waking up in a way I
think and I've rarely heard people talk about this much I'm sure some people are
aware of the correspondences here but I've never heard anyone say much about it some
people who have said things like no our dreams perhaps but most people don't talk about the
meeting mind is see it just doesn't have so you know my son again you were mentioning some insight
I love I love what you shared from him he was saying one day he was like you know in a dream
you can find yourself in some weird situation you can ask a question about it and the dream
just back fills and it just makes it just confabulates next pour as much of soil in
there like yeah yesterday was your birthday you blew out a birthday candle and that's why the light
isn't going on and turn it on right now to just distract your structured intellect right from
becoming too intrusive and thus collapsing the situation so it's like so your dream does that
and you believe it in the dream right what if it could be the mind doing it to you I think I
agree I think the mind is threatened and so it back fills it's like oh surely everything happened
here for a reason yeah no I like that because the dreaming aspect its goal is similar to the waking
aspect its goal is survive which for the dreaming aspect means keep dreaming sure and if you get an
explicit answer to a question in a dream you're about to wake your shit up that shit you've done
dreaming if you get an explicit answer in the dream if if Michael is explicitly Michael I'm about
to wake up someone asked me for my ID I'm about to wake up I'm trying to take photographs I'm right on
my way to waking up any kind of explicit identity and dreaming is this thing that happens at the end of the
dreaming cycle toward the apocalypse I think you could you know people's things are very different
I rarely have any conversations ever I mean that's entirely natural because speech is not what's
happening in dreaming we can remember conversations in dreams sometimes yes but it's not because we're
making face noises your face was asleep let's be really clear about this you weren't making right
that was not going on so whatever it is that is appearing as conversation in a dream is not
conversation and if I for myself I'll stop laughing here in a moment so I have a million other questions
for you but if I try to explicitly say something in a dream particularly if I'm angry it tends to come
out of squeaking and the harder I try to yell the worse it goes for me yeah for me it more calls it
just falls out telepathically it's just like my thoughts are projected at the person and then
their intention and thoughts it's a I think it's a form of backfilling but sometimes it's completely
transcendental because it's like oh we're communicating part of you part of me is stimulated you're like the
next generation I'm like you know I'm like William Shatner you think you have a more you have a you
have like an Audi mind you know it's more extroverted maybe I don't have as much connection I think to my
intuition and allowing my mind to just speak without thinking somewhat first in certain contexts at least
especially when I'm alone hmm whereas I feel like you could just walk around and talk all day yeah
you're probably good yeah yeah I mean you'll see fascinated by the sound of my own voice which isn't
necessarily a recommendation sure sure but yeah it doesn't mean I don't have thoughts that couldn't
be defined by words yeah it's just that they're they're buffered I think in closer to my body so
I feel more in dream and a dream than I would talk there are certain things that seem out of
even dreaming one of them is language because it's explicit yes I mean for dreaming identity and
meaning are always multipolar whereas in a waking consciousness it's very easy for them to become
monopolar all right that is a door it's not 19 things it's a fucking door pray right don't tell me
it's a ghost it's not a dragon princess right it's not a dragon princess orchid right baby
right it's a door right but in the dream dragon princess or baby no problem right let's go I love it yeah so
all right um was there a person you looked up to when you were a little bit you wanted to be like
Garfield's yeah in a con in a in a comic strip maybe kind of facetious yeah sure
like yeah I'm asking about yeah role model now I mean you know my father I'm sure to some degree
there's a form of more subconscious itemization hmm it wasn't over it'd be so fortunate if I had felt
so totally well enchanted but it wasn't actually that kind of moves more of an authority figure
mmm I don't know if I felt so like I needed to be someone else that's not what I'm asking um I'm asking
was there someone who you wanted to be like who you were like you felt an affinity for their way
of being you thought like I can live toward that person's way of being in an excited way and I'm not
expecting that this is something you had but I'm just asking yeah I'm just trying to remember I haven't
thought about it for a very long time and I'm trying to think very far back because I was like a hero
slot like nine four hundred fifty heroes yeah I love heroes when I was little especially yeah so we
moved around a lot and sort of different people in my life so I think that combined with a general
introversion less attached to figures maybe not that I'm the end-all be-all you know I feel like it
would have come out more in media or games because I had access to video games from a very very early
age and so the ability to interact with complex visual narratives I think it's probably the first
place I would have like playing you know TIE fighter made me want to be a pilot and so this notion of an
empire and the ability to accrue merit and a deadly skill of flying something that goes impossibly fast
was that's more of a pursuit of a skill hmm no I think probably the closest thing unconsciously was
would be my siblings because my my middle brother Matthew especially would just interact with all kinds
of things in certain ways that I found just fascinating so whether he was role-playing or trying to play
pranks on our older oldest brother or just building me suits of armor out of cardboard and you know uh yeah
those kinds of things it's playful and then um yeah I don't know I don't know what happened beyond that
didn't latch on too heavily to really concrete heroes I think until later on uh and then later on who would
be one yeah gosh uh I can remember being really interested in people like Alex Gray talented artists
um the designers and visualists and also psychonauts Robert Anton Wilson yeah Wilson would really
charmed me I think Leary's kind of nuts but Wilson but Wilson would interpret Leary and give you the
bits in a filtered playful way I thought I thought oh okay you know the map's not the territory here but
we can have so much fun that's so funny because that's a courtship skin I'm sure you don't probably
actually know firsthand much about courtship ski at all but yeah that's a courtship ski derivation
which is like you're you've been given an interface and you didn't engineer it you don't know where that
thing came from and it's broken so I tell you that interface is not this is the the sort of idea of um
which has recently become I mean it's been philosophically interesting since greece but
we don't talk about it a lot uh some particular um minds among the ancient greeks
thought that it was impossible for you to understand anything about what was true or real or good
because your interface is human so the only chance you have of having actual understanding is to get
beyond the human interface beyond your senses um but these days we have stuff like uh physicists who
are claiming that consciousness is basically just an interface right it's like a desktop on your computer
doesn't tell you what's going on doesn't tell you anything it just gives you a sort of navigation an
array of navigational potentials that you use that are highly limited and so forth and um
i don't think they're wrong but i think it's incomplete there's there's more interesting
ways to look the problem in any case uh
so you had dreams of being dissected which by the way is pretty much what waking consciousness does to
dream you should be aware of um and the draining line isn't necessarily freaked out about that because
it doesn't have a body really doesn't really know a body so it doesn't necessarily terrify it have you
ever had dreams of your animal uh that's a really interesting question do you mean where i appear to be a
female what do you mean a representation also for male it's the archetypal representation of their
the feminine so a woman would have the animus which is the opposite
but what would i'm just trying to understand um according to the purpose of your question what might that
look like i mean i can tell you what i think mine looks like oh by all means probably a handful of times i
interact with my enema and it's the same each time in a broad context it's a woman it's a woman
that i see facing away from me and when i see the woman their dance begins and there's sort of people
dancing or movement around them and i the gravity is apparent it's this is the we are in orbit one another
i'm not actually chasing them they're chasing me but i am drawn and when they turn their face is made
of light and i am overcome with the immense beauty and love of whatever that is and we sort of dance
and spin and spin and the power for the force of that just wakes me the up because wow what a great ending to the dreaming
uh oh my god well collect collapses the dream there's just yeah yeah but still what a great i mean of all
the ways for the dream to reach apocalypse that's the best one i've ever heard of and or never i never even
imagined it um yeah it's beautiful inspiring the only experience that i've had that mostly resembles
that was a feature of the early experience in toy maker where he was showing the mother
mother of all being and it was catastrophically ecstatically like we were spinning there was it was a dance it was
it was a musical thing and the adoration was just
transhuman i mean completely beyond anything i'd ever imagined possible i had a very loving and
beautiful mother so she totally adored me and this i don't want to disarm my mother but this was way beyond
anything was possible unless in fact it was my mom and that my mom you know was is kind of shielded
right the extremity of her actual adoration for me to somehow uh shielded or you know um held behind
and still filtered through the imperfections of and also danger and propriety and all those things
right sure um that's a beautiful story i love that way to end the dreaming cycle that's the best
apocalypse been a while since i've read about the anima i feel like i'm horribly um and misinformed on
i do of course with females and dreaming okay and sometimes very profoundly over the past few years
though it tends to be weird okay weird in a troubling way i mean do you ever have normal dreams
dreams it's hard to know i don't it's hard to know what a normal dream would be like
dreaming is so trippy compared to our waking experience and i think we could learn a lot about
you know one of the things my son said was maybe i've already said this completely but
i don't think i did not in this conversation i did earlier today with longer okay so my son came
me one night he was like dad you know how your dream can backfill right yeah i taught you about
this right you can you're in a weird situation you're like um fleeing a two inch tall picture
and so a pink tyrannosaurus rex in a medieval castle and you're wearing a clown costume and you
know you suddenly wonder like wait why how did i get here right and the dream can backfill so
convincingly that you actually take it for granted this all makes sense right two inch tall tyrannosaur
kind of costume maybe with hassle everything's perfectly fine you go on dreaming right you just
keep dreaming the dream again its goal is to survive right keep the bubbling happening it's
sort of like a juggling thing right the dream is juggling in a sense and the waking mind is kind of
the opposite of that so my my son was like okay so in your dream the dream back fills and you believe
it right and i was like yeah he said why the fuck would you not think that your waking mind is in the
same thing why do you think that you existed yesterday why do you think you have a history
are you sure you're daring how do you know because your waking mind it backfills way better than your
dreaming mind does compared to what your dreaming mind backfills your waking mind is a professional
like a hitman of identity perfection right do linear chop chop chop chop all the way back
right i'm sort of exceeding what my son presented this is very important to think about especially if
we're concerned with something like awakening which is the um reaching escape velocity
of personal identity and the weird um traps and prison nearing conceptually relationally
in terms of our faculties and skills and abilities that most of us live and die inside
inside unfortunately i think we're living in you know we talked about this the other night right we're
living and dying inside like 0.05 of our potentials beings and most of the rest of that is forbidden
it's hidden our habits and who we are exposed to in the context in which we exist they don't invite us
out of the cage and they reinforce the cage um when did you become interested in ufos
i great question i first considered the possibility something weird was there i saw an episode of
unsolved mysteries and i can't remember the name of the case they focused on i should know this
by heart by now but it was about two women and a young boy who encountered something on a road at night
and one woman got out of the car to look at it as it sort of assaulted them with light and when she
tried to get back in the car it burned her hand and when they when it went away and they went home
they sort of had some physiological effects and i know both the women died
um of cancer relatively early age or shortly after the not shortly immediately after the experience
um yeah i mean it was it was related in a captivating way that only that's all mysteries does when
you're getting in the 90s and i thought hmm interesting because it wasn't a murder mystery i thought
okay so those are real i kind of looked around like why aren't we all talking about this
mm-hmm but but we weren't and so i just kind of set it down but then when i re-encountered it
in 2001 sorry 2003 i read a book by dan sherman called above black i found this was a couple
years after the disclosure project with steven greer and so i kind of devoured those and then
then progressively started it kind of start started to tip the scale i started to read more and more
books i'd say around took a while um it wasn't until 2017 when i really realized i was trapped in a
vacuum like i needed to interact with people in a much deeper way on this and externalize everything
that i had learned and was learning and so then i built the basis for the ufo wiki and that's what
allowed me to become a moderator of the subreddits and yeah now i have a much more much more immediate
access to people that are similarly insane over it all so it occurred to you that the part of you that's
the human is the smallest part the smallest the least significant feature of your being is your
human i guess these concerns have to do with your own origin i think i mean you could come at two you
could come in different ways you could redefine what it means to be human you could cast off the
label of human and just interact with whatever it is either way it probably the latter is more productive
because you're not trying to maintain this box and put things inside it all the time
sure no but not in the sense that
i still inhabit a human so there's still because it is still part of that whole it still feels as though it
is a sacred divine uh ridiculous expression of all of that infinite and so when maybe it becomes more
like a tool or a vessel than uh the fundamental focus but it still needs to be attended to and seriously
appreciated and cared for i agree with all these things um let's say more about what you're asking
sure um we're trained to think of ourselves as humans and we are also given a set it's not necessarily
explicitly delineated but we're given a lexicon of the features that are supposed to be
accessible to us and those that aren't sure you can teleport humans don't teleport sure right there's
no such thing really as telepathy that's supposed to happen supposedly yeah according to the book of
supposed to yeah yeah john yeah there's good research that pushes that boundary pretty hard yeah yeah we
agree um and i have lots to say about the non-ordinary aspects of our being in nature but um
i don't want to go i want to be careful about luxury but there's we have this thing right which is
actually very tricky especially if you're on if you're intoxicated or you're on psychedelics or whatever
or you're dreaming just trying to take a look at this thing in your dream see what happens to you
you're going to have a very unexpected array of experiences you're going to follow you just going
like what right and so you know there's a relationship between this thing and this thing
they're very similar structures right when you find body or working members each three segments one
thinking member with two segments it's not an accident now there's an upscale version of that that
has the same difference between this and this because upscale from this you have eyes
ears mouth you can speak you have all these facts these abilities that you don't have here
and this is amazing let me be clear this is as good at least as good as wings plus tentacles
almost plus eyes right this is some nutty this is the thing that changed our
nature as being but um what i'm getting at is that uh
the humans seem to be trying to figure out whether there's aliens or not
and i think they're really fucking confused about that because
when we have questions about things in the sky that we don't know what that is that don't fit in our
life spawn we actually have questions about the nature of reality what's going on what does it mean to be human
what does it mean to be a being what does it mean to have a mind are we related to those things or
are we separate and in what ways these are some of the questions that occur to me because i've been
similarly fascinated since i was little the first as first you know i grew up when science fiction was
young right 50s 60s there was earlier jules verner and whatever right um edgar allen poe 18 1800s
but yeah i grew up reading um science fiction
what that was actually doing was modifying what i call the uniform which is the the everything that all
other things descend from right the the thing that all things inherit their qualities from
and so the humans are walking around trying to tunnel you know stupid or whatever especially in groups
and it's not helpful to call them stupid but um they're trying to figure out whether there's others
and the problem is like i think the actual problem is the same problem as trying to figure out if
this is if this is a monster to this right it's not that we are them it's that there aren't two things
i'm not trying to convince you or preach i'm just saying like i think ontologically we're confused about
the nature of the nature of identity humans tend to set themselves separate from nature above nature
and they're also very warlike toward anything that impinges on their authority or hierarchical
supremacy right currently which is pretty stupid right especially in a situation where you just have
one body and there's a bunch of different yeah you're just going to kill right yourself um all right so
have you had experiences no have you seen things in the sky no what about dreaming no who's the person
who are some of the people you know that you most trust who have had experiences uh well yeah yeah i mean
i can respond to your general notion too because i don't think it needs i think there is a
a there is a
broader context that is relevant that involves what the phenomena means in relation to how we define
ourselves or place in the universe what the universe is what's going on how cheese is made oh jesus yeah
but there is there is a concrete quantifiable component which is what happens to the people
who get very very close to the thing what do they see how long does it last what does it say back to
them how are they impacted how does that correlate with others who have had the same experience so that's a very um
um
that's a curve based analysis right you're going to produce a curve from all the reports you're going to
look for hills and valleys in the curve sure bank right quantitative quantitative qualitative aspects
yeah it's a general it's generalizing over the continuum but yeah i'm one with you yeah but maybe not taking
what is the average and saying that's the truth just are there averages yeah what is what are the
commonalities yeah yeah yeah that presumably are across countries have been filtered out for mental
illness did not retrieve this information through hypnosis right and and have been studied and voluntarily
given whatever their experience yeah that's only been done once only one of these studies really yes
and it's done by the free foundation um i don't remember the acronym of but it's uh funded by the edgar
michael foundation and it was done not too long ago it was almost the only quantitative qualitative study
they did a few thousand found a few thousand experiencers across 140 countries and did a quantitative
qualitative analysis and i mean it took hours to answer all the questions you know but they wrote a big book
called beyond ufos which kind of contains the results and then individual researchers perspectives on those
results which are all over the place and then they're they're a theory of consciousness that
sort of has arisen as a result to try to explain it it's funny because um
um ufo has recently been changed to uap um but if we took the uap acronym a little more
i don't know insightful we could call it unidentified awareness phenomenon something that rises in
awareness that doesn't fit in the lexicon but anyway please continue yeah i think there do seem to be
though there seems to be a commonality between the experiences of and the encountering and interaction with
other or a group of others that is willing to express something that isn't just like you know with the
ghost so i think those are probably the most relevant people in those positions are the most relevant
because they have the most direct experience of the phenomenon they're also the most time consuming
and difficult to interact with so most people don't have time for that and that's understandable fine
would you like to meet the non-human intelligence absolutely
would you sign up for that if someone said like we can make this happen yeah of course
course um did it ever hurt you that the party that wants to that would say yes like all in might be one
no because i'm human so okay um i think that's funny
i would have to be shown otherwise so okay that's reasonable and also if we could just use
the definitions lightly that i am a being that has been acculturated in this society and i want
to meet something that is completely outside of it that's all it is i mean um
it doesn't mean it's not clear to you that
a tree qualifies blue jay qualifies it does it does absolutely it does and i was tempted to communicate
it's the tree the tree no i mean flickers but but not enough to write a book about
did you ever write a book about a girl you kissed yeah you did you her okay well i'm
gonna have to not do that yeah yeah yeah i wasn't expecting that yeah yeah i mean i only made one copy
for her she's very special that's awesome i i why was that going to be a a zing oh because um kissing
and writing aren't the same kind of thing at all not like a kiss yeah oh they're completely different
yeah right if you have to you said that i never wrote a book about it but most of the most important
experiences of our lives we don't but yeah they might find their way into if we're writers they might
find yeah they might find a way to our writing but we're not going to sit down and
to write the description of the plot of a dream is to rape the spirit of the dreaming it's not a linear
description right in any case um have you had to let people in this
experience no and what is one of the most puzzling non-ordinary experiences that you haven't had
that you just couldn't you know i've been to a you weepy which is a native american ceremony
i was hoping you might speak about this well there were things there that i couldn't explain but i didn't
quite have the opportunity to pursue it repeatedly the way um my understanding other people close to
me did so some things happened there we were there were curious questionable but i just didn't i wasn't
quite sure how that was done so either it was a very sophisticated magic trick it wasn't fundamentally
otherworldly so i remember when um i went to a um session with uh michael harner he was a
anthropologist in the 40s 50s and 60s who went to indigenous cultures around the world and studied
their ceremonial traditions and tried to figure out what they all have in common um in a sense he was
like uh he produced a sort of not dissimilarly to what you're talking about with the ufos right he took the
sort of sum and produced a kind of derivation over the over the continuum of everyone does this thing
they read portents in stones someone brings you a stone they have a question they bring you stone
you read the stone to them
you bring the stone back to nature um everybody believes in something resembling the underworld
in which there are animal companions everybody believes in the upper world in which there are
teaching beings so just about everybody has a way to go to the underworld
go to the upper world this usually involves drumming um and he he showed us these things
and gave us experiences of them i managed to get his attention in this room of like i don't know
400 hippies but i watched this thing this year was probably circa 1998.
um he wrote a book called the way of the shaman he brought sort of he's probably fundamental in
bringing shamanism to the united states if he brought the shamanism um whatever that may mean and we can
mean different things by words so it depends on what the purpose is but my point is that um
i had experiences at that uh training but i couldn't really understand there wasn't a good explanation for
them it seemed as though it was just my imagination he played the drum he told us what to do find a hole
in your memory find a hole in the tree find a cave right find a place where water is flowing into
water and it's creating a vortex um or a nest of an animal that's circular find one of those in your memory
when i play the drum i want you to go to the hole but in your memory imagine that you go to the hole
you enter the hole and you're in the tunnel and the tunnel may be lit you go through the tunnel
keep going through the tunnel as i play the drum until you come out in the space
somewhere he'll come out when you come out look around find the animal see if there's an animal
there here it has teeth
don't go with it you have to wait for an animal that's not fierce it's not a predator
when you find this animal have an exchange
it so i listened to him and i did the things he said we all did 400 people playing the drum
and i had a really weird experience um which i'm not going to describe it's kind of personal
and it's dangerous to share because it's very personal someone who wanted her you could use it
right that's why i'm not sharing it explicitly
um in any case yeah i have this experience and i thought like i have to see my imagination
i can't be sure that that actually happened to me but there were two features inside that
that i knew were not my imagination how so um because when i got to the place first i saw the place
and then the place was a wild place like a natural place right it was actually a clearing in the forest
and there was a there was like a big log of a dead tree there right and i was naked and i was
flipping around and then i before i saw an animal what happened was the whole scene was replaced by an eye
looking at me and it was a very specific kind of eye and i thought it's very powerful
but then what was revealed was not it's not the kind of a being we usually think it was about
and then that being took me to another made me follow it we went to another place and the same damn
thing happened there the whole thing was replaced by one eye right and then the eye i really inquired
into me in a serious way and checked me out and uh and then there was a second animal and that was
uncommon nobody reported that on me nobody's animal led them to the second animal and my animal led me to
a much older animal um in any case i'm not trying to sing the phrases of my experience what i'm trying
to say is um sometimes in a non-ordinary situation like the one you described what did you call
was that right and is that um is that term specific to uh unindigenous people that's makota
makota um so what i'm saying is were there any parts of that experience that were resemble what i'm
talking about where you can be pretty sure that this wasn't a magic trick you would require further
interaction or investigation on my part and it was a one-off experience for you for me yeah yeah
regular access to that so just once yeah that's how it was with me at harner just once um
and do you have any intuitive sense of whether or not it was a magic trick i don't know you're
you're just totally uh the menace man was later
uh outed for faking the ceremonies oh that's troubling isn't it but it was only after his
relationship to drugs had changed this is similar to something that you were reminding me of earlier
because um of the water and the spirit by uh god from the kina fossa
yeah i'm sure i know his name i was very close with his secretary who recently did his life
mark from mark okay perhaps will come to me in any case i don't i don't people can fake it it's true
i don't feel as if i've encountered something i fundamentally could not explain okay i mean although
i mean it's ironic i feel i have disproportionately studied non-ordinary experiences my entire life
the fervor and studiousness that is not common i wonder if part of you might be
trying to ensure that doesn't happen um to ensure that something inexplicable doesn't occur yeah that
you don't find yourself in the situation where i don't think it's a resting for control or
some sort of bless you
uh there are just fascinating things out there that speak to the fundamental nature of reality
that can't be explained and there are specific domains and very generalized domains
and it would just behoove anyone that wants to know
what that is what that's like you know i would i would argue that your desire to have such an
experience is inexplicable so i don't have the desire that's for the desire and the fundamental desire
okay so what
what does drive my present what does he want what does he want yeah well but who's who is mike
razzle right agreed like a living being in the present moment so that could change minute to
minute day to day but there must be sort of a an aura of of razzle-ness yeah yeah yeah yeah not
everyone would use that that label but um um what is motivating to find yourself by what you want
go uh it's yeah it's tough i mean you like girls i like women yeah yeah yeah
you like you like seem to like tech seem to have a thing for tech i like beauty i like chaos i like order
i like the intermingling of the two i like the two snakes spiraling upwards outward into infinity i mean it's
it's all crazy so it i don't want to believe something about it and what i'm doing necessarily
it's it's a moving fucking target i mean i'm i'm dying all the time and re-emerging
and trying to keep up so uh you want to give something to the future of the humans in some
kind of a statement that isn't merely an aphorism what you don't i don't think i'm i don't feel
particularly motivated by a sense of lineage or uh immortality through
denting things with my imprint i do think that each interaction i have with the living world every
moment has an ineffable infinite impact that's beautiful and so the opportunity is present right
now it will be when i walk on the street pass by someone else or a fly on the wall so okay so really
what i was asking you for was something like a principle that a principle uh we could make it just more
playful and abstract sure yeah it's it's uh what's dancing right behind you you know what where does
the joke start just start where's the thread that i can pull to hear all hear more of it and get to the
crazy laughter uh because it's it's i've got it sometimes um it's just what is what is that thing
that's happening over there that people are just losing their minds over that we ostracize them or
try to erase or compress or encapsulate in these boxes that no no that was this thing all right it's
not real or those people are crazy you sure yeah what's the part of you that makes that decision what's
what's what's this job what has it ever done it's built around judging other people it's put a lot
of boxes together that i guess and vicariously standing on looking down at sometimes but
not supporting me a very long telescope in some moments but uh okay yeah it's
i think it's just the pursuit to understand myself and what i am better and and and to say yes to the
the moment okay i love the spontaneity in the spirit of what you shared there and trust it too um
has there been a moment in your life where you felt like this was worth my birth oh yeah many times
could you share anything about one when it comes to mine sure what has been so universally validating um
um yeah there's like hugging a stranger and that's your only interaction with that person ever um
those are beautiful moments sometimes it's them prompting sometimes one time it was me prompting
uh gosh uh kissing the one person that changed everything that's those are yeah those are moments
those are yeah they're fucking sparks that shoot out all over time for those things oh yeah
there's looking backward at like what your parents did for you i think and when you see them age and
interact with you as an adult and it sort of cascades when you see other people being parents or
whatever you like i don't have children um but in my nieces and nephews seeing the just the
the fractalizing of love and layers that it's like we've just been built upon and built upon it's
kind of crazy that's more of an ineffable thing uh yeah interacting with something that someone has
created with such care and novelty that i cannot believe that they pulled that off or or i'll give
one more uh finding out someone that i admired was the person that i was talking to the whole time
and that nda that i signed was to make them anonymous not not not separate me from them
because i didn't never interacted with them but oh you're that person those are crazy good moments
yeah i could just wake up and michael douglas is the game you know once in a while and be like that
that's what i'd chase after but yeah flicker of that i guess just answer your question i'd love to
hear one of yours oh my god it's a it's a very personal question um i don't know what happened on the
first day of my life i don't have actual memories of that they told my mother my mother was had to give
me up for adoption because of the parents like either you let us raise them and lie to everybody
it's not your kids are so she was too young or not very young she wasn't she wasn't she was young
and she wasn't married she's like 17. or um you give them up for adoption so she was like i'm gonna let
me raise my kid i hate you and they told me that uh they told her that i would die they told her i had
a hydrocephalus c which is water on the brain and i'm dead by tomorrow and then it took me off apparently
two little few in oakland but i got both my parents back and i was my mom so that's pretty
amazing in human life uh my first interactions with praying medicines there ain't no science fiction
that you compare to matching that stuff is those organisms are they're not like anything humans can
think they're they're pure science i mean i think organisms in general my relationship with natural
creatures was way different than what most people's seems to be
um so it was filled with awe and wonder like a snail that's enough for me you got one of those i don't
i don't care you got a million bars of gold i'd rather have a snail you know there's nothing as astonishing as
as wooden organisms and places um death of our first stone it's horrifying if my car ran all the way home
whatever the first girl that i adored and i'm really capable of adoring girls and i was made to adore
girls or something i don't know it's bad it's it's worse than myth and romance yeah it's bad um
a few times i saw something that i had no idea what that was and there was no way to fix that problem
yeah that's some good it doesn't matter like one of the things i argued i've had people come to me
with stories and they'd be like dude you really you seem you know like you're intense and you're
intelligent and you could help me understand what this was i was like did it ever occur to you to not
go there like what do you mean like did it ever occur to you to preserve the mystery
maybe the mystery was actually an important thing yeah well dominant culture doesn't leave a lot of
room for mystery so no we're kind of the opposite it's you know quite hacking at it progressively all
the time the dreaming mind has no problem with the waking mind is not happy with that
shit it's a threat to its sovereignty and its dominance its frenzy right um
the love of my parents was really rich and sweet
and i'm hungry i don't even remember whatever the hell toy maker was
like yeah say more drugs are boring orgasm is nothing orgasm is mad shit it's nothing compared to
what it's like to be with the intelligence that is
parental and or companion to us
we are miserably alone
it's wrong we're not meant for that it's yeah it's like remoras without sharks
right what would they do you know um caterpillars without chrysalises
what would they do right they just they can't do what they're supposed to be
imagine it seems worse than that bees without flowers that's what it's like or flowers without bees
right it's just there's something we're made for that has been entirely
um separated from almost all of our experience and there's it's wrong it's a fundamental injustice
in a way all the other injustices are really just
farts from the intestines of this rude injustice in the core of our being
what's the biggest present barrier to rekindling with that there isn't one
um it's so close to us it's just as close to us as this thing here is to me it's that close it's right
fucking there but i mean there is a barrier the barrier is conceptual cognition
it's how language tells us what things are it's that that's it that's the fucking cage
knowledge is the barrier knowledge killed our flight potentials
does that mean there's a necessary pathway that an organism has to take in terms of its relationship
with knowledge such that it transcends it versus there are antidotes to the prison if that's what
you're asking yeah there are antidotes um learning about the dangers of language knowledge conceptual
you know i was talking about this earlier with andre in the interview i did this morning
which is really good i love his mind and we were talking about liberation and what traps us and most of
what traps us is is that we it's conceptual it's categorical i think i know we transfer the solidity
of our expectation of the continuity and form of this object we transfer that onto everything we
think that everything is like this almost nothing is like this what's actually going on has very little
to do with um what are we doing yeah what's going on okay yeah almost nothing that's going on has anything
to do with how we conceive of the world
cool just lost tracking that's all done continuity form we transfer the expectation of the continuity form
position function relationship
from long-term continuous objects like stones and machines we transfer that onto the whole scope of
existence and that that is a fundamental error um that feature of the real is
true and relevant to about 0.0007 percent of what exists it's very specific uh yeah i was making noises but
yeah a very small portion of what it sure is just like that right um also if we could shed
even momentarily and this is why people like orgasm and it's also why they like drugs or other um sort of
you know extreme or edge experiences uh they like those experiences because those experiences dissolve
the expectation of continuity of form function identity um which of course dreaming does very naturally about
drugs or talking or you know guns or whatever meaning to get more advanced guns guns worst idea ever in the
history of ideas yeah yeah close yeah um
so there's a bunch of impediments that we are wedded to
we are going to do anytime we choose to agree in a sincere way to set them down we are free to do so
but unless we make that formal agreement
we're like um we're like drowning people grabbing the anchors
yeah it's a painful analogy just reaching deeper and deeper down yeah yeah just gonna drag your
shit down sure sure barrel mostly and look i'm like that too most of the time um the greatest blessing in
my life is other minds who are curious and want liberation and want not justice in the sense of
vengeance but justice in the sense of um clear scene or truth or resurrection of our souls or
work it's great talking to you and you michael yeah we should do this again sometime oh very soon
uh maybe both was long enough absolutely absolutely yeah i've loved you basically since i named you so
thank you i'm so grateful for your like way in the world um all that you do there's so much more to
discuss about your vocation your mind so let's do another one sometimes absolutely i look forward
to it and yeah thank you very much appreciate the opportunity it's great to record it so until next time
yeah much love
