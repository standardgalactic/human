well your injury made me wake up and just think i want to talk to you i want to know what's in your
mind what's in your soul what's in your dreaming what's going on i just wanted to know and i felt
like perhaps i might have something to um offer you know uh that could perhaps be medicinal or
helpful or insightful or something but that was just if it actually turned out to happen which
often happens for me is like when we first spoke i just had these cascades of insight about things
that have been bubbling in me for a long time that i felt were catalyzed by you
and that's still going on i mean our first conversation
tore me a new one or three that's i've been listening to more of your
content recently and i was like oh that's why
um and i we haven't really we've kind of touched on some of these things but we haven't
directly um but the people you surround yourself with are all touching on these things and i'm like
it that makes sense then that i would be to this net um for example one of my main teachers is
has studied a lot of the toltec teachings
and
that kind of dreaming comes and goes it's active it's not active for me it's it comes in different
waves of trying to be more active um but
the
i just want to touch on this um
because i'm trying to feed into it the third mind that
i don't have any particular insights about that i just want to acknowledge that um
i'm starting to understand more
and this this is because of my injury it is because of my
isolation i'm not isolated i go to therapy every day but i'm isolated in the sense of i'm not going
to work i'm not i'm not part of the machine anymore which takes away other motivations and
and
desperation um
so there's things that have been percolating and driving me to explore um
for years and years and years and years and years i've never got off
that but sometimes i can't go as strongly into that as i want to and recently i've been trying to
go into that more strongly and um
it's helping me see
that perhaps that third mind i inhabit more frequently and i am aware of it um
that's as far as i know how to go with that one
i mean language isn't necessarily important um that's like my toy phrase
for something that i've discovered that i think we can do together that's natural
to humans and we for some reason we're not really
um given the opportunity to think and speak openly about this
no one you know we are i mean i'm gonna lecture a little bit here we are trained and scripted to
think that my mind is separate from yours right and that you know we can get together or whatever
but that when we do get together our mind stays separate in this little bubble called darren
and i think that's actually completely backwards i think minds are made for the third
mind experience communal consciousness communal awareness communal intelligence communal adventure
healing memory memory and amnesis recognition resurrection all these things and this separate thing
this whole idea of like separate minds is actually a bad disease
bad disease like and i also came to recently suspect that thinking is entirely the wrong thing that my
minds are not for thinking minds are not for thinking in the same way that fish are not for crawling
i would agree i would deeply deeply agree with all of that um and that is what this new experiment in my life is
is um giving me the freedom to explore more intentionally um
so okay so that's actually why i wanted to talk to you
um because of some of the dreamings that i've had recently oh cool
so and there was one i had recently where i was like i just i have to tell him about that great um
so this experiment i've i've always been in and out of playing with dreaming um
i quit well i actually was getting pretty i was doing the whole like
like trying to follow the toltic path as much as i could i don't really like castaneda's writings um
but that just happens to be the people that i kind of got pulled in with
and i was trying to become more lucid in my dreams which by the way so i have seen
something similar to the sun in my dreams but
the second that i saw it i became lucid and realized i could control it
and started playing playing around with the light in my dream like immediately i was like oh my god i
can change the light so it wasn't it's like it was starting to come up over the horizon and
immediately i was like oh i can change this and started playing with it so it went more to the
light than the sun and that's the only time i can ever remember seeing the sun in my dreams
uh but that's separate so i kind of got away from my dreaming um the beginning stages of my accident
so the first time we talked you mentioned the separation from the cosmos and it got to me and
so i decided to study astrology so of course my immediate inclination through studying astrology is
my particular teacher um it's not about reading it's about dreaming with the planets so the course
starts for me my my training is trying to track the moon and dream with the moon and see what comes up
through dreaming um absolutely nothing about astrology has come up with dreaming at all however once again
it puts me back in that place where i'm working with dreams again so here i am again
um and i i give up like this is where i'm staying i get it but what i started doing is
reality testing my dreams um
because the very first i told you about the first experience i had
i had with the paralyzed person that lives in australia um and the last time we talked and that dream
checked out he knew what i was talking about and i was like okay well something's telling me i should
just keep reality testing this so every single time i've had a dream with an individual that i recognize
in it i reach out to that individual eight times out of ten um there's a correlation not every time but
extremely high percentage of times there's a very high correlation um
to the point where it is kind of bothersome it does disturb me a little bit because i have no way of telling
what's mine and what's theirs
it seems like my it's just amber stuff it's not it's
not but it all feels the same it has the same texture it has the same essence within me um but i'm
definitely picking up on things that i shouldn't be able to pick up on from other people
yeah i love that phrase shouldn't be able to pick up on right right according to what i know who's the
authority that figure who wrote the book of supposed to tony and johnny supposed to of brooklyn new york
they wrote the book supposed to you're not supposed to be able to pick up on that stuff
so if you're actually separate which is the reigning dominant myth right we we think our minds are
separate we think our lives are separate we think well you know i'm only responsible for my stuff
etc etc go ahead i'm with you right so on a separate note
that's also been very exciting to me it's it's all all these things that i've been
exploring and investigating for years and years it's all starting to come together and i'm like oh
okay this is what's happening like this is this is why i'm probably in this position because i
i might not have been brave enough to go forth with some of these explorations but i also started
taking a course a meditation teacher training which um as soon as i got injured
because i was like well i don't i have what am i going to do like sure you do something
um and unbeknownst to me so this particular method it's not about meditating like it's not going to
be that deep intensive meditation where you're trying to discover unity consciousness or the clear light
it's very much the system that they're pushing out into the world is very much
about realizing that we are all interconnected and that if you are responsible for your stuff it helps
me out so it's just about becoming more aware of your own internal nervous system and how that's
interacting with the social nervous system okay which i've always felt to be true um i just didn't
know how to articulate that in a way that didn't sound blue to people yeah and you're not supposed
to sound woo by the way right so i'm handed this methodology and i'm like oh wow this is great
so i'm doing that in my spare time right now and it's um exciting because as i pay attention to the
dreaming stuff i'm like i'm going to tie these two together eventually i just don't know what that looks
like yet the dream i wanted to tell you about so i was listening to a podcast and i've never heard
this podcast before it just was one of those random like hey you should listen to this um
um science and non-duality sans and the guest was i think her name is manda scott
she is a she is an author she also practices she doesn't like to call it shamanic dreaming um because
in her opinion the particular culture she comes from can't really say they practice shamanism um
but i was listening to this podcast and i liked where she was kind of going i liked her vibe
but i didn't i didn't get any details deep details about her um
um or the book she was writing i know no more information and i went to bed that night and i
um since i've i've been trying to educate i've
i've been trying to ask my dreaming body
about how i should be moving forward with my education um and trying instead of having my
thinking mind decide this is what my next steps are going to be i'm trying to nurture what should my
next step be so i went to bed and i asked as i do please what should my next steps be what what what
should i be doing and i had a dream and of course it wasn't mystical it wasn't magical but there's this
guy and the the essence the quality of this guy in this dream was i he's looking at me and going you
are mine like not in a caveman way that people are going to and i say that a very much like a proud
ownership um and in this dream i'm you know there's silly things like i'm looking for a new apartment
like i'm going to a car wash whatever like not nothing magical so at some point he hands me a broach
a gift which now i'm like oh you should probably pay attention to gifts and dreams
and as he hands me this broach i'm kind of looking at it and the thing that
he goes and he sticks it through my cheek which side my right side okay and so i was kind of like
like he goes to hand me another one i was like no i'm good thank you i appreciate it but i don't
really like how that stuck me um and i woke up and i wrote this down and
i decide that next morning i'm like you know i'm gonna look up this lady i'm gonna see what she's
about i'm gonna see what kind of dreaming she's teaching what is this and as i sign up for her
newsletter i get she just finished a new book and so when you sign up for the newsletter you get a copy
of the first chapter and that book is called dreaming with the amber hair so i was like okay
i'm gonna read this and the story starts out there's this character and she's going down to the water to
dream and she has a brooch in her hand and the whole beginning part of the story is about how she
comes to receive this brooch and in the story something happens
and a character that knows how to dream in the story recognizes that something much further down in the
lineage is going to happen and she needs to intervene and her point and intervention happens
at the time that the brooch is given and so it becomes this item of memory that gets passed down
generation to generation to generation and so this woman's going to dream with the brooch so she can
figure out why she has been given it and as she does this god-like character that's how she describes it
because she's assuming it's a god it's a spirit she doesn't know yet comes to her and she asks it what
would you have me do
and so i'm just going to read the response
um
so she's asking what would you have me do
she says their children's children's children will not stand at the last line between humanity and
oblivion calling the old gods back to the healing of the world
he waits him being the spirit
she says i didn't call you back you came
and he said you sat by the scrotting lock on the night and held the sun brooch in memory of your
grandmother she said i didn't know what i was doing i certainly wasn't calling you
and she says if i understand there's another the conversation kind of goes on
um
she said if i understand you correctly now that i know how
i could choose to call back the old gods to be the healing of the world
she says how exactly would that be different he says intent is everything when this night began you
had no clear intent
so getting back to the question of what should i do what would you have me do i don't see
how the world can be healed short of removing all the people
and he said all it takes is for you to care more than oneself really to care
the sun is rising he may be of the sun but he is fading
and she said i don't i don't think i said that aloud even so
she says all it takes is for most of us to care more for the world
and after i read that i realized that was the answer so i went to bed that night going what would
you have me do i was handed this brooch in my dream i woke up the next morning and read this story
about how this character was given this brooch and the answer essentially was you need to care about
the world more than you care about yourself
that's it
it struck me
even before you were telling this story and i just want to circle back to this so that i don't lose
the riddle
the riddle
go on if you will which is not a riddle a koan it's not a riddle it's a sort of like
a what is it it's a it's a grinding stone for the meditative mind in zen koan right
sort of grind your mind against it and eventually hopefully there's some kind of opening takes place
but the riddle written beneath your tattoo
has plagued me since first i heard of it
and it struck me this afternoon as we were talking
you actually implied even though perhaps you didn't say directly
that the question written there isn't actually the question
and
i don't claim to know what the question is
but from above the ordinary human perspective it would be immediately clear
that your mind is actually located in all the minds that aren't yours
right
i
listening to that conversation again
today
and i heard myself describing
the intention behind getting the tattoo and where it came from to you
and hearing myself from as a third person that's not experiencing me i was like wow that's
really obvious it's really obvious um where that message is coming from um
because i said i was sending myself a message going don't forget me
and i thought i was sending future amber that message no i was receiving that message
much more obvious and clear if you're hearing it as you know an outside part yeah yeah this is one
one of the beautiful things about um these conversations and occasionally recording them
right because then we can we can have the perspective
from outside where we were in the moment in the conversation and so forth
um
yeah the secret yeah dare i say this yes i dare my name is darren
but um the secret of the third mind is it's not the third mind it's the first one
right this is the third line this one's like you know three steps down the confusion ladder
the first mind is actually the one we have together and the weird one is the one that we
suppose we have in isolation or apart and by the way you were making fun of some of the stuff in
your dreams you weren't actually making fun of it but you were um
you were i mean i don't have to use a severe language you were um
making less of two things that you specifically mentioned
you were looking for a new apartment
a new apartment right right and the other one had to do with the car wash are you kidding me
yeah and i've been getting a very new nice new snazzy car in a lot of my dreams frequently
oh yeah but you haven't yet gotten the walking experience have you or have you um
i am moving through my dreams so when i'm moving experiencing my dreams it's always through i'm never
watching myself right size right i was flying last night okay in a contraption though um
so i am moving i haven't checked in and how i'm moving
yeah fair enough yeah so i've had i'm not having i was there was time periods where i was having
i was moving awkwardly and i was very aware of it
or i would go to stand in my dream and i would be like oh that's right i don't know how to do that
and then i would like fall um not i'm not having those experiences um
um but i am getting around so but yes i thought about that today with the new car i was like oh
that's interesting all right yeah but also like a car wash is particularly um redolent
of metaphoric meaning in a new apartment both of those like they might seem really ordinary superficially
but that's just because the waking mind doesn't see them as sort of metaphysically redolent of
metaphysical you know profundity and yet the dreaming mind does pick things uh or it doesn't actually
i'm not even sure if pick is the right word it selectively enhances prop the possibility space
in a meaningful way is what i would say um god what else was i gonna say yes you know without being too
specific uh in my dreaming i am aware in my dreams of certain limitations that are native to my waking
experience put it that way and so sometimes in my dreams there are things i will either resist doing
or i will tell myself oh you can't do that because of some limitation that i am aware of in the waking
world um flying in a contraption
a brooch through the right sheet
right cheek pierce was it curved is it like a hook because it sounds when you're okay
no it was straight but i i took it away to for me
i took it to mean remember this because it would have been a detail that i would have
i might not even particularly remembered but the next morning as i was reading that
i and this character immediately is given this brooch and it's like this is important
dream with this and i always like oh my god my dream last night like i think if i had just been handed
it it might have disappeared but the fact that it was pierced through my skin was like
you're gonna remember this so i mean um how familiar are you with the concept of
we don't actually have a word for this in english
and by the way oh yeah there's some back there's some circling back i want to do a couple of things
um so since we don't have a word i'm going to resist the urge to call it a fetish but um
are you familiar with the very ancient practice of using objects
so dream with like sleeping with a specific object under the pillow or very near to you
particularly a sacred object or something that's particularly meaningful to you
so those uh things i don't know what to call them we could call them dream foci or we could call them
amulets um there's different things we could call them i don't think it's important what we call them
i think it's important that it's like what what was said in the writing this thing that is referred to as intent
right it doesn't necessarily mean
what is your plan
it doesn't necessarily mean that
it in
in dreaming practices and in traditions that i've become familiar with from indigenous peoples
this word could be translated various ways in castanaden tradition uh the word impeccability is often used
but one of my other close friends who's a shamanic practitioner of many decades
um use the phrase ruthlessness
and what she meant wasn't um tear things up and kill them she meant
exclude all features of thought concern evaluation suspicion prediction probabilistic thinking exclude all of
those things and be absolutely focused on the the action at hand
without reserve unreservedly focused on the action
so that's what she i think meant by ruthlessness
and that's often what is meant by this word intent in this context it can mean
you're goal but mostly it means the way you exclude obstacles
you don't even consider obstacles they are no part of what is going on yeah
i i that's how i that's how i understand it energetically
that's why i'm still delusional
uh-huh
uh-huh well um
i guess we think we know how we're supposed to be
right i'd love to know what it is we're using to make that determination
what's the what's the metric what kind of you know ruler are we measuring with
and and why would we trust it because that ruler is the ruler of a disimpersoned being
it's pure measurement there's no heart there there's no lungs there's no pancreas there's no spleen
no bladder no digestive stuff no you know liver no kidneys it's it's just measurements on a stick
so it has some use but i don't trust it about deep things
i don't anymore um
which is why i appreciate being able to explore this um because i'm growing in confidence
um
this thing that i have wanted to explore with other people um
um i'm growing in confidence
that it's okay for me to explore that um in fact i am supposed to explore that because
if you look at the deep sickness
that is happening right now it's the same
it comes from people not being aware of that mind um
i think that's why when i read that um when that character was saying you just have to care about
more than
yourself immediately i was like oh
duh like
this
is all me
yeah as soon as i put myself there
i'm no longer alone i'm no longer separate um all of all of the the the the crying lonely angel
that's saying where is my mind doesn't feel that anymore um and when i listen to other people talk
other people talk um listening to music on the way to rehab today um i i hear the same story coming out of
everybody and that's that's where the sickness is
so i feel more compelled to begin coming out about this these things that i've been exploring um and keeping to myself
um which i think is also why i was like i have to tell him about that dream because that message to me is
very important
um
is the amber hair a bunny it is
yeah
yeah there's something about rabbits and dreaming
i did see one the next morning too which i kind of knew that was gonna happen but
it's like oh there it is
yet to see when i'm dreaming and i'm sure i'm sure there is i'm sure that's what the book is about
i don't know what the book's about yet but
obviously i mean but i know but that's but the author admits
she is part of her her mission
is um
she believes she believes dreaming a path to that world um where we are taking care of the world as
if it is an extension of ourselves which it is and that should be obvious but
um
it's not for a lot of people so she recognizes being an author and she's also studied
how language affects the mind if she can create that bridge using language you know
um so that's what the book series is about and you know it worked obviously but
what what was more intriguing to me is how just i didn't know that yet but i managed to tune into
her intention and dreaming the night before
another one of the weird ways it seems to me that we become confused and alone
how does it do with time
yes perhaps that is what i wanted to explore with you
because you have talked about the separation and why why is that why is that there how did that get there
why are we
yeah i mean the history of that mystery is rich and profuse with
a strange novelty and cascades of crisis
do you have your suspicions
many okay i have a whole library of those but i'm happy to um explore rather than just you know without
my books um
i i don't have any inclinations however time
um an experience i had
recently i communicated this experience
to you as well um
so oftentimes you know i go out and
i
try to sit in the sun around 12
and
there's a species of lizard
this is the first time i've ever seen it where i live
um
very beautiful it has a bright blue belly
and i've never it's not it's not a skink it does it's not
no it's actually a blue belly mizzou
yep
and
i've never seen them before they're just gorgeous and i love watching them
and you know if you're someone that spends time outside with animals
some people think oh lizards there's if you live in florida there's hundreds of them and they're
different but no this is the same lizard i see him every day
mm-hmm does the same whatever
mm-hmm yeah
then one day
animals have
animals have daily routines let's be clear about this
absolutely
um it's mind-blowing to me that people would think otherwise like there's a family of cranes that go by
at 12 30 every day
but one day i went out and
the adult male lizard was not there
but
there was a young lizard now there of the same species
and
thinking about time
instead of looking at that situation as if it was something that
happened in a linear aspect of time where there was an adult and then there was a baby like
for some reason something in me was like that's the same
lizard
this is just the same moment happening again just refreshed and something about that experience felt
ancient to me where it's not where somebody that lived in that kind of time felt these beings being
renewed and not dying um
this
awareness i was watching a documentary once um i forget what it's called it's the one where the guy goes and
makes friends with an octopus
my octopus teacher
yeah
oh
this is one of those things where if anyone's listening to this and they haven't seen it
i'm going to spoil something so maybe don't listen
and yeah plug your ears until until you wave your hand yeah thank you so
as you're watching the documentary and you know
you know
he makes there's there's things that happen
where there's mannerisms that these two share
because they've gotten into relationship
and then this octopus
dies
and something in me knew it was like it's going to have babies and those babies are going to know this man
and it's not and that that's exactly what happened and he was surprised
but to me it was like no this is
that's what reincarnation is it's
but to me it also changes the relationship to time it doesn't become linear at that point it just
becomes renewal and i i don't have a different word for that because
language exists within time
okay so there's there's a bunch of threads here
so waving my hands yeah yeah there's a bunch of threads here
that i think are important and they have to do with the dominant paradigms of delusional
separateness
that um are imposed on us by our culture
the language users we encounter and how they treat identity and how they treat sequence and how they
treat causality
and those treatments become instructions
that we learn to obey in consciousness and in evaluation
in other words
there's 10 billion things per second going on we excerpt
a specific array of features of those things which are then emphasized
in consciousness this is called exertion
and rather than
clearly understanding that we are making derivations over a manifold
we pretend that we are seeing what's going on
what's going we're seeing what's going on
right and we're also figuring out what you know what and who did what when caused what thing and
who's responsible whose obligation is it you know when we go to court we're going to know what
happened here because this thing happened and that thing happened you know on and on and on we have this
we have a crappy second mind
that's based on a lot of
stuff that not only isn't true
it is impossible
there's no
fucking chance that
shit could be true
and we treat it like uh like it's a fork
like it's the most absolutely reliable thing you could hold in your hand
you know exactly what's going on
and
there's so many things i want to talk about here but i'll try to
i'll try to remain coherent
one problem there there are
okay there's a there's a two layered situation in being human
and i'm going to argue that the bottom most layer in this toy of it this is just a toy
orbits three principles vigilance ambiguity and prediction
vigilance is what we're paying attention to and why and threats tend to get the most attention
and ambiguity is the unknown that's mystery we don't know what that is
unknown ness raises vigilance okay the more unknownness there is the higher vigilance tends to go
and when vigilance goes pretty high we start becoming insane
right we can't bear a high vigilance burden for very long most of us
and the reason that we're we're relating with the re what vigilance and ambiguity are doing
in this loop is they're making predictions about the future or about identity
okay so we got this vap thing
but then above that we have this other thing that i'm going to call
what am i going to call it
i'm going to call it the amphitheater
and the amphitheater contains familiar rules
the role of victim perpetrator rescuer judge spectator comedian
lover child mother father right but mainly these the roles that we tend to play are
victim persecutor rescuer judge spectator like commentator right and those roles are really
familiar to us so we know how they work out and when we know how a role works out that reduces
ambiguity which reduces the vigilance burden so we are happy to trade our freedom
for a familiar role that we know how it works and the reason we are happy to trade the freedom away
one could argue i'm not going to make that statement about myself but
we are we are often willing to trade away most of our freedom for the security of knowing how something
works and the reason that we're i think it's the language is very tricky i don't mean the reason
the justification for doing that and most of this is done unconsciously we don't do this unconsciously
the justifying feature is that we don't know how being human actually works
we don't know how improv works we don't know how spirited amazing playful wonderful wondrous
enchanted improvisation and play you can't tell whether you get a paycheck for that
you can't tell whether you get kissed or punched you can't tell whether the house stays built up
around you or falls apart you don't you can't make reliable predictions unless you're using a reliable
role right and so what we tend to do is we pick one of these roles and we can switch roles right i can be
i can go from victim to rescuer to persecutor to judge to spectator to commentator to comedian
right i can just keep going around these roles now the comedian is a weird role because the comedian
kind of kind of knows about this problem and is actually poking fun at it surreptitiously without
calling it out directly right that's why the comedian's hilarious um but i just want you to see that
if we're playing authentically we can't tell whether we get the paycheck or the punch the kiss
the liberation or the death we don't know and so
that doesn't have to amplify vigilance it doesn't have to but there's a lot of ambiguity there we have
to learn to play openly with novelty which i would argue both the octopus and the human were doing
together moment to moment they weren't playing victim they weren't playing persecutor they weren't
necessarily playing rescuer and there's something so that that that brings me back i just want to
highlight that i'm going to highlight one other thing i mentioned my dear friend um a brilliant
actress and teacher in europe josephine larson who i hope to interview very soon because it was when i
was thinking about her that this this last this next insight came to me um actors do something really
weird which is they come to improvisatory life within a role that's entirely pre-structured
they bring they do the they almost show us the way out of the trap by coming to life by bringing a dead
role it's already entire every move in the role is written out and pre-structured and yet by coming to
life inside that in a way they show us the key to the cage they become the key to the cage right in
front of us by doing the opposite of what we would expect okay
coming to life within the role
in a way
in a way that is still a trap
um
okay i was but there's something there's something in that i was thinking you might not want to talk
about this um
the toy maker so we can talk about that
i know and toy maker might be a trap that's that's not what i mean okay i but i was
getting this understanding earlier today for what
that could be i was getting the image that there is a history of roles
within us that are asking to be played however the way that our consciousness immediately responds
is with that hyper vigilance and fear um and it feels like it's improv but it's actually not the role is
already there oh yeah that's that's not unreasonable um we're we're just um
we're playing with what the word improv actually means here but i'm with you so far let's let's go
um
um
that's basically as far as i go with it however the other thing that was kind of knocking at the edges
of that was um within those roles
those roles have relationships
um
to other things in the world
um
and then if we can embody that role
we start to be able to see those relationships forming in different ways
um okay so am i understanding you correctly when you say if i say for example um
a truly good doctor who's all the way in and present with her patients
is enacting the rescuer role but she's not avoiding
the liberation it's not a trap
or it's not as much of a trap maybe you're not saying that help me understand what what you're trying
to point at here what i'm trying to point at is those roles
there's roles that exist in me that i haven't played
however they're they're in me already i just have to
step into oh yeah yeah yeah i agree i i often think of these as um
i mean there's there's not there's things other than roles that are similar
i think for example that um humans probably have i don't know 472.5 senses
but we usually don't develop them partly because we're told we have five
right i mean i can point out some other ones right quick you can sense whether you're
hungry or not you can sense whether you're hot or cold you can sense where you are
you can sense kind of if you're awake or not you can sense whether something's alive or dead
you can sense whether somebody's being duplicitous or not
you know lots and lots of senses but i don't just mean those i mean
the capacity to sense how to heal an injured being with your spirit or how to
touch another mind that isn't human or how to remember before you were born or how to remember
after you're dead or you know things like this um how to teleport how to buy locate
you know things that we think of as impossible again we've been told what you're supposed to be able
to do and what you're supposed to be able to do is the very it's like in my view and i know i say
this over and over again it's a shitty trope but it's it's like this little part of the fingernail on
the end of the pinky of my humanity that's the part you're supposed to be able to do anything that
you're not supposed to be able to do you definitely aren't supposed to be able to have like the whole
hand you're not even really supposed to have a finger and you better not have a wrist
because that just leads to crazy um there's something though that i you know i i'm sensitive
to share the conversation space and hear your thoughts and and in you know insights and concerns
as they as they arise but i want to go back to the octopus very briefly
when i was a kid
i was probably about four or five i had a i met a pregnant praying man
and we became very deeply bonded um i used to feed her bologna she would eat bologna well you know
she was she was fat and pregnant and um sometimes some nights she would stay in my room and some days
i would put her out on the lemon plants and she would hunt stuff out there
and uh one day she took a chunk out of my index finger and ate it just like it was a piece of bologna
and thankfully i didn't fling her
it hurt and it scared me but i don't think i flung her if i remember right i don't necessarily trust my
memory all that well but i don't think i flung her and i saw her lay her eggs
and i saw those eggs hatch and i gotta say watching a praying mantis egg case hatch is one of the
craziest amazing things you can possibly do as a human being but especially if those kids contain
some of your own meat right okay so this whole thing about separate identity
and that when the mother dies she's actually gone and that memory doesn't traverse generations and all this
kind of seething is straight up bald-faced lying it's just it's reductivist
mechanist nonsense that's very compelling in language and resembles certain kinds of understandings of
mathematics
mathematics but the thing with which we forge mathematics and the thing with which we understand
math and the thing with which we make the evaluated determinations
is not captured within those systems it is beyond those systems
i know that the children memory is a crazy spiritual metaphysical bizarre astonishing thing
that has nothing to do with mere records and you know one of the things i was trying to say to a
friend the other night i was being very emphatic about it i was like
i said a few things if it's okay i'm gonna run through them quickly but if you've got some
thoughts you want to share i can pause okay so these are crazy toys but they're important
imagine that a manifold is a mathematical construct with many bubbles and dimensions in it
and imagine that um what we think of as physical separation and form
are express our expressions of taking slices of this manifold let me explain what i mean
imagine a child who has a praying mantis on his hand and they're looking at each other and what i want
you to imagine is that in us in a dimensional space just two steps above the one where they're
separate in form looking at each other those are the same organism they're actually not metaphysically
those are the same thing right just as if a part of myself appeared separate in time and space but
it's literally me and i am literally it now imagine that all the forms of life on earth are just peculiar
slices of slices of a single manifold one thing and that in a slightly higher dimensional space
those are the same being they are the same one so that's the first part of the toy now here's the
second weirder part of the toy and then there's a third part that's even crazier imagine that the earth
is a library of all of the forms of life on every living world in all of time
i've had that experience come to me
so that praying mantises are the dominant life form on another world whales are the dominant
life form in another whatever dominant means octopuses mice and they all know it they all know
this except the humans have forgotten it so the animals come up and they look at you like
and the humans are like yeah what you're a mouse and i was like no we're the same thing
on my world you're a tiny little thing that can't talk right on this world i'm a tiny little thing that
can't talk but i know you know what's going on it's it's as if um you don't have to go anywhere
to go everywhere because what organisms are are living planets are connected to each other and they
they emit the forms of of the entire manifold of worlds on each world uniquely and different sizes can
mean different things it could be that large animals live on planets near to us in time and space
small ones live far away or in the future who knows i mean there's different ways to think about
it you can play with it however you like and i'm going to say the last thing briefly so that i don't
have to go on forever here and become tediously didactic
everything you see in nature is a mode of time space the sun is a mode of time space the moon is a mode
of time space the oak tree is a mode of time space i am a mode of time space the cloud is a mode of time
space the rainbow the octopus the mouse the lion the elephant these are modes of time space they are like
the fingertips of a hand you cannot see but trust me when i say the hand has a unifying body these are
one thing right not in some wooish or you know metaphysical philosophy way no no in a very direct
way these are these are the faces of the same one right without religion right they are the same one
and so when the octopus and the man come together there's this gigantic hyper structure of unity above
them and it's it's finding a way to improvise and negotiate the expression of that unity in their
different temporalities because the octopus lives for six months the man lives for 70 years right she
lives for this tiny little fragment of his lifespan and so one of the things that's happening are the
two temporalities are mating right fruit flies live for like 13 hours right tortoises live for
170 years and you can get a fruit fly on a tortoise right and those two temporalities hey this is the
last thing i'm going to say organisms are to time as stars are to light living planets are the most
incredibly rich temporal situation you can possibly have in time space because there's all these
hyper structures of organismal temporality it's it's madly rich if you go just like 300 miles above the
surface of the surface of the earth events per second up there four come down to the earth events per
second trillions okay unless you don't get light
yeah yeah yeah sure but i mean um the the temporalities that arise from the interaction of the
physical substrates of time space are different in kind i think from those that arise in organisms and
the organisms are hyper complex it's not an accident that you have 47 trillion cells half of which are
bacteria and that the animal cells have each one of them seven organelles or 15 or something or i can't
remember the exact number so and then you're filled with viruses too which are like 10 trillion of those per
cell so what's going on in you temporally like relationally temporally billions of trillions of bizarre
complex bio relational interactions per thousandth of a second okay that's me done being didactic
for a moment thank you for putting up with that so here's the problem i can't wait
you can explain that to me in a way that makes sense
how this is what i want to explore i'm not saying we can find this answer i don't know maybe we've been
looking for this answer for a long time actually a better toy would be really helpful because what i just
did was very didactic but go ahead how so i feel compelled to work on the issue of human separation
how do you get the humans
the humans to experience that in a way that they know that truth
yes good question so i'll begin with a prohibition you don't just talk to them about it right like i
just did that's why i was complaining about being didactic by the way because i'm just talking about
the behind at ut sizable questions but if you're concerned how you'd be able to experience it after
you would like to finish theack and so for be breaged andにな quierey
so what you have to do with humans is you have to give them a activity that they do together
for each other in which
each other yes in wit
is that essence of the I'm doing this for you not in a sacred way right yeah in a helping way
uh that could get mixed up with the savior thing yeah I mean
one of the words okay one of the words we can use is cooperative yes we are co-operating
thank you okay and so we are um merging our each of our unique skills faculty senses abilities urges
drives motivations we're merging those so that we get a a higher level organizational body
which is sort of what I meant by the third mind which I really think should be called the first
mind a higher organizational third body a higher level organizational body with faculties that none
of us could have alone but that we naturally have together and there's nothing easier than to show
people how that works and if they don't believe you and they want an argument just point at um a
football team is everybody the quarterback no is everybody the linebacker no who kicks the field
goals one guy one woman right why because what they do is they're forming a higher level organizational
body out of unique specializations that each member has and that's what nature does all day long
it's why you have different organs you just if you open up your body you don't just see one organ in
there and you don't see nine copies of the same thing so what I would like to play with
is okay I like trying to figure out how to play with people's consciousness um
and so this is something that I've been trying to work on like how can I get this
what what could I do to help activate this in people um
I don't know I'm just at the very very beginning phases of that
I mean play play and improv are very powerful um
ingredients components
this is part of why I mentioned Josephine because she gets people together to do
I think it's very scary to improv improvise
right when you're not used to it once you get used to it it's just fun
well it's not just fun but it's fun it's less frightening
um but what what we can do is we can take
one of the best things to do is to take a problem and improvise around the problem
and if the problem is how do we get people to have a direct experience of their non-ordinary
intelligences memory these things that could actually be the problem that we
put five people together to play with right we can use that's what you're doing yes exactly yes
so we can actually solve the problem with the method that we imagine is applicable
okay it's similar with dreaming right and also another thing we could do is we could get people
to seek insights together over a period of time as they dream separately
we could get people to play with meeting each other in dream space
we could even and this would be very useful by the way let's say we got five people including the
person who is um the what would we call them the hierophant or the not necessarily the teacher
but the catalyst right the person who's leading the other ones so we probably can't um
i mean we might be able to but let's presume that we can't actually get these five people
to lay down and take a nap and dream together okay so let's do something similar though let's get them
to sit in a circle let's start out with a little bit of a statement of intent here's what we're here to
do this is why we're here what we trust in our goal today is this beautiful thing that we're all exploring
and then have them imagine that they're having a dream right now and have them imagine that each of
the people in the circle is meeting them in the dream and have them imagine that each of those
people brings them a little piece of the answer to the puzzle and then have them imagine that that
they they integrate those pieces together and then have them imagine that they wake up and then have
them talk about their experience wouldn't that be beautiful yep so we we may not be able to get
them to just dream on command but we can get them to play and imagine on command yeah yep yep that's
beautiful and i didn't have this idea before just now i'm improvising doing the thing i was trying to
talk about right yeah i love that especially because i don't actually know if i knew what the answer was
i would be there already i wish that were true because i i often have the ability to see answers
way before i can enact them way before that's interesting i feel i don't i don't feel that way at all
i what i'm what i'm coming to terms with is i don't often have the right question
um i remember in one conversation we had you said that i was a seer
i'm being open more i'm trying to be more open by acknowledging that i've that's not the first time
i've heard that um and i've had the inkling that all the information is right there you just have to
ask the question i don't ask if i do ask the answer will come up um
um i just can't find the right question frequently and there's something right now that's asking to be
explored that is what questions arise when you bring this process to other people and see what happens
in between also totally separate that to me that mind is what i would call the holy spirit
um and i don't know that just needed to be said i mean that's one of the ways that i think about the
identity of toy maker um this is my my little name my you know like a like a name you call your best
friend friend or something right like a nickname yeah nickname right um that's kind of the image i
was getting when i was listening to our last conversation and i was imagining toy maker and i
felt like i started to understand what that was and i was like oh i see that now okay i get that
and i was getting the image of um the library of identities we could inhabit that are not inhabited
right now in this time space but they could be inhabited and there's information in them that can
only be accessed um if that identity is allowed to take over and also oh yeah yeah that identity has
different relationships um in time and so what i was seeing is that's what was trying to come in
there's something and so what i guess what i'm trying to say is there is something trying to come in
that i don't have full access to right now and i'm trying to figure out what the question is
um and it relates to because once i know what the question is okay and i guess i could just ask what
what is this i am doing that that is what i'm doing that's part of my exploring
as you might know um one of the in one of the extinctionati meetings
any of you welcome to attend if you ever care to um
we discuss at length the problem of what
and how that's probably the most dangerous
knife that humans use on their intelligence
and the reason that i say that is because i mean in zen
there's a couple of co i mean probably all the koans actually are just
um i don't know actually i i'm gonna say very clearly i don't know what those are
but one could imagine that all the koans are actually just to get you to stop whatting
just stop whatting um one might imagine that if you had the intellectual solution to the con of what
is a moon which is often the first con people are given the intellectual solution for that would be
simply no longer make the gesture of reference in your consciousness
no more reference stop referring to them
because probably like
99.79 you know 70 000 nines
of your energy of awareness is being used to do something that is stupid
and wrong and if you were just you don't even have to do what's right
you have to figure out what the right thing to do is
just stop doing the stupid thing that's eating up 99. you know billions of nines
percentage of your awareness and what is it hilariously what what what's the thing i'm supposed
to stop doing it's that thing what it's the what thing what is that what am i supposed to do what is
the question again what right all of this wedding and of course there's seven primary question words
in english which fascinatingly all begin with a doubling of yourself right the w you have to split
yourself into two the one that's asking the question the one that's answering the question to
the one that's asking the question the w what when where why how who uh which but then there's one
of the question and by the way all of them the second letter is h and that matters there's something
weird about that h letter it's like it's like breathing onto a mirror and there's all these little
dots that reflect each other and they reflect you breathing onto them and it's very weird thing this
h letter huh huh um and then there's a vowel some kind right o a uh i uh claire e right um
who o a e i o u right all the vowels are in there you got you got w you got h you got some vowel
and then maybe another thing or not but um one of them just begins with h and it's how
a vowel so it's important to notice this that's one of my little homilies it's something toymaker
taught me to pay very careful attention to and when we become very concerned with what
is going on i am supposed to do is the question this what it's it's not that we should never do it
but we might want to try a different approach you might want to know like here's the thing
when toy maker was with me if i got super busy asking what or who are you
the vitality of the communion would degrade catastrophically instantly
and so i learned to notice that and i realized
i mean you can imagine a fairly mundane experience say the experience of joyfully
kissing and being kissed by someone you love right imagine that your primary concern becomes what's
going on here how's that going to go i mean in sex it would be even worse right it would be totally
disastrous in sex to do that so there's certain kinds of experiences that are so profound and intimate
and astonishing and brilliant but what is happening or what i'm supposed to do or who is that or how did
this happen none of those things matter in fact the moment that we start to think about that we fall off
off the uh the slack line right right the slack line of of ecstasis or insight or awareness or ecstasy or
freedom that comes from being just very deeply engaged in the kiss the taste of the food
the first rays of sunlight on my face in the morning that little sound the animal made and i don't even
know what animal that was uh these kinds of things so you know keep these things in mind so that you don't
get too obsessed with what's the question i'm supposed to be asking
that's a beautiful smile there's nothing more to say after that sorry i wasn't trying to put a cork in it
i know but that's
that's it i forget this all the time this is the problem i know crazy things but unless i'm with
somebody and we're sort of doing that thing together i'm just like a regular zombie bouncing
my head off walls and smacking myself with a hammer or you know drinking the whiskey i was gonna ask
though um as you're saying all this have you ever spent a long period of time in silence
depends on what you mean yeah sure like a couple of times i did a zen kai
which isn't i mean the zen kai's i did a very minor it's not even of a pasna retreat
it's like three days one one time one day and one time three days
is that right two times one day and one time three days
uh and that was pretty intense but i was a lot younger and you know i sit i try to sit each day
but it's only it's only 25 minutes it's not long so so the the basic answer is no interesting
that's that's that's it that is that's the answer and i i don't i don't mean silence as in
like a retreat i mean that silence you know that stillness that inner yeah where where that
is that that other thing is communicating oh yeah i mean i think that's part of what's going
not necessarily the whole thing but it's part of what happens when we sleep right the um the uh
the hindu tradition breaks up the a um right into what is it um waking dreaming and deep dreamless
sleep if i've got that correct and so in deep dreamless sleep there is that kind of stillness
but while i'm awake
except when you were with toy maker well that was such a weird thing i mean that was weird as hell
i'm not sure it was silent i'm not sure there was stillness maybe maybe i don't know though i don't
know i really don't that thing's still mysterious to me though i have stories i have various stories
about it i can make up stories for fun about what it was or wasn't or yeah
there is um
there is i would suspect a place that you could go that is that um
um and it is made of that silence and i it's not it's certainly not stillness um
but it's funny to me because i do i i do know that i do know that is the point
so when i ask what it's shut up and just be with that
and the rest happens um and when i am in that place that's where i know that's what that is i don't
um yeah um and it's just being brave enough to walk forward in that place as often as one can
yeah to garden there to water the plants of it to
be the sunlight on their leaves maybe
it's funny often in dreaming i have a situation where
this happened to me this morning
i come across
pets that i have neglected
i forgot that i had a cage full of praying mantises in one of my rooms
they probably haven't been fed in years surely they are dead by now
and yet i go there and they're not quite dead yet and they need some food
um this morning it was a parrot
that i used to have whose name was nike
and i realized like i haven't given him food or water in days how is he still alive
i gotta get him will he even drink the water can i get him to eat some nuts i mean
and i don't know what's going on there but i think these are aspects of my soul right that are just
starving in in the waking world right they're just being totally deprived
um and they need they need a little bit of love and some attention and some nourishment yes although
the book i'm reading right now
um the main character is dying
and she's being walked into dead realm and she was instructed before she went there that
one of the worst things you can do for the living is to hang around
um and not not be allowed to die and so i had a um a cat second time i thought about him today
just the the best the best cat my best little friend and he
died um and the next three nights consecutively i had this is kind of gory but it is what it is
sorry um i had i had dreams of his body rotting and decaying and slowly being eaten and he was that
was it like and i thought it was um or no i was just thinking about that so that part
to me that's his energy um i was being freed of that energy that memory so when i come home my body
doesn't expect him to come running anymore because he's been digested digested yep um and so that's
that's what i'm discovering with my dreaming recently um like when i i told you i worked
at that retreat center for a little while and the facilitators they would always be teaching like oh
you know everyone's dreams are a reflection of parts of themselves and i i'm really just beginning
to doubt that more and more with my experiences like i really don't um
it's very very clear to me now that actually a lot of things in my dreams are not me it's not
you know yeah so it might not be parts of your psyche well uh it's complicated because once again
this is the what question what are those things in your dream right and what when we ask what we don't
actually necessarily get the answer of what the thing is or what's going on the answer we get is what
what was our orienting concern when we asked because our orienting concern when we ask the purpose that
drove us to ask will produce the type of the result the species of the result say again that what you
would consider your intent uh no we were using intent in a different way it's what i would consider your
purpose your goal because if you if you want okay imagine that you meet someone new right and maybe
either you're kind of annoyed by them or you're sort of enchanted by them either way it'll work right
so if you find them annoying you're going to be looking for reasons to become more annoyed every time they say anything
so that's going to be your purpose in evaluating their speech behavior even though you're probably
not aware of that purpose you're not aware that you're judging them because you're annoyed and
similarly if if you are attracted to them everything they say is going to become more enchanting like oh
i knew this person was very special right so your purpose determines the kind of the result of your
questions it determines like whether you have a kitty cat as a baby or a dolphin or a blue jay so to
speak i mean those are kind of ridiculous because they're not animals but purpose to turn we think
when we think or when we speak or when we evaluate that we're figuring out what stuff is and what's
actually true which is weirdly like the supposition about the dream okay that supposition about the dream
that everything you see is part of your psyche
isn't true about the dream it's true about the purpose of the person who said that
right you are correct the purpose of them
and they're there so they're projecting their purpose onto the dream and i would argue that they're
doing that somewhat like they're doing that unconsciously and confusedly and also they're not
wrong it's not wrong but it's wildly incompletely true right um i think i think most people have been
taught that that's they have yes that's a very common bullshitty um one valued lens to use to look at
dreaming and one of the main problems humans have after what is they have one valued thinking oh that's
a this that's just a this dreaming is just your psyche doing right just this one thing one valued
thinking there's no there's nothing in the universe that is one value except human thinking about things
it doesn't resemble anything in nature nothing in nature is single value
i know of course immediately i want to ask why and i'm like no
oh well no it's okay you can ask why the why is um
thinking you know reduces vigilance and ambiguity which makes predictions much easier
you know that's one way of answering the question it's not the only way
pretending that you know you don't have to be vigilant anymore the ambiguity is gone
you'll stop asking what's going on and what that is and what's next we we are we are the ai
no language is the ai we're the thing it runs in
crossing my legs it takes a lot of effort
i got mine crossed too at the moment and it's dangerous for me because i could be injured that way
but i'm making a joke not yet
okay got it
um
yeah that's i'm i'm kind of laughing and realizing like we're the ai because i'm watching
i'm watching my mind well one the mind is having the conversation but two i'm watching it
try it's caught in a loop of trying to figure itself out um
and immediately once again why why am i like that why am i like that not why am i like that why are we
all like that um and it's almost like this entity has it's it's coming out of us and it's it's becoming
its own being
the aspect of cognition that wants manipulables it wants to grasp and manipulate a tool
that aspect is the cause of most of our confusion and a lot of our trouble
um and and the rest of the problem
is this
this is the rest of the problem no i'm kidding i'm just making a joke actually this is um jacques
lacan's uh graph of desire it's a very sophisticated intellectual toy of the interiority of humans it's
one of the weirdest toys i've ever come across um it's got all these little features uh this is the
bard subject and what bars the subject is language um it's got all these crazy little features
there's a few people who can explicate this well it's not my goal to do that here
i was actually just holding it up as a kind of cartoon
humans weird yeah it's mostly i think actually the main problem with us is
language yeah i mean you could say it really simply um
um alfred korzybski said this the is of identity is false
it's one of the simplest ways to encompass almost the entire problem
whatever that whatever this is it is it cannot be a finger
a finger is a a token used to point at this this is an infinitely valued
thing with infinite characteristics so to pretend that we're not exerting
is what fucks us up and we do that because it reduces vigilance and ambiguity and then we think
we can make good predictions not really true it's true in very simple senses if i put the pot with the
water on the stove and i turn the stove on right there's a little bit of ambiguity there but that water's
going to boil that prediction is probably going to come true how have you ever sat intentionally with ambiguity
yeah um which of us hasn't been sick or injured
what was that which of us has not been sick or injured
which of us has not been in love
i mean hatred's kind of similar too
which of us hasn't been frightened or terrified of something
those are all maybe you mean something different yeah um because the the what i've what i've noticed
okay have you have you ever
have you ever been in an experience where everything was truly unknown to you
um like we have we have a set of patterns we follow every day um and when that gets broken
i mean yeah uh at least briefly but um certainly the experience that i refer to as toy maker was
wow uh unimaginable prior to the experience and unimaginable within the experience
and unimaginable after the experience um but i would argue that being in love is kind of similar
especially the early phases of that we often refer to as limerence some people recall limerence
um the the high enchantment in the beginning that can happen that stuff's pretty crazy
and then the other thing would be anytime there was an accident
like a car accident i was in when i was 12 was pretty nuts
we flipped a honda civic for two-door coupe seven times kitty corner at 75 miles an hour
that was i'm sure we were dead
uh but also even a simple accident like um
once i was playing pool with my son and i was drinking whiskey and i went to set the glass down
on the little card table and i missed and it shattered
that moment of it shattering was
i was sorry was weird but maybe you mean something different than those how about you have you been
i
try
to catch
as many patterns as i can and unwind them
which is not it's not reasonable all the time it's just not yeah i don't know what you're doing
you're not supposed to do that amber but when you do do that
what i've noticed is the pattern finding mind really activates
it's excessively um
on the other side of that
it it really begins trying to find an answer
but also the quality of the feeling that comes if you can be in that place intentionally is
interesting to me and that's why i asked if you get past the hyper vigilance mind
i mean um i this may not be what you're trying to point at but it does occur to me that sitting zazen
is a little bit like that and also doing tai chi is a little bit like that
yeah because you're trying you're both you're familiar with the form of the behavior
but inside that form you're exploring yeah
um but again i would say that like i mean it's been a long long time since
anybody kissed me but a kiss is kind of a similar thing i would
i would argue against that a little bit i'd love to hear your argument against it only because
i would argue against it only because we have such a programmed behavioral response
that to that okay let me okay let me back up
when i was 13 i met a girl named gg she was 18 she was kind of a tomboy
and i met her on a baseball diamond and she was pitching baseballs to boys who were hitting balls
and i had just seen uh the bad news bears in which tatum o'neill plays
like a sort of a kick-ass um tomboy right and so i took gg back to my mom's house my mom's apartment nearby
and
we started kissing i'd never been kissed that way before
i had never had
a girl's tongue in my mouth for example and that was pretty
fucking weird um
and about as compelling as it could possibly be while at the same time being sort of disgusting
um and i think we had like a single kiss that probably lasted more than an hour
uh and we just sat this kiss for forever and i don't even understand what the hell happened it
was like going to another universe now later after that then i started to understand that there's sort
of a form to this thing here's kind of how it goes and you can do some other things while you're kissing
you know all those other things but the first time it was like going to outer space
and i mean i could say even more crazy things
so literally the first i don't know if i should share this is kind of personal
i'll just say like the first time that i did that thing that humans sometimes do together
i lost consciousness immediately as the process began and i did not regain consciousness until it was
over i went to a place that was fully darkness and there were just these shining colored lights in
that place and there was no darren there was no anything and for the entire span of the event i was
checked out for whatever reason i have no idea i've never heard another person say that i believe
other people have had a similar experience but i've never heard someone describe it that way i
had no idea what took place for that span of time no recollection of it just flashing colored lights
i've had a similar experience oh really not completely disappearing no but the lights
the lights with be still being embodied um but i would i would categorize all of those experiences as um
i feel like there's a massive part of our mind that knows where it's going
um hang on just a moment okay i'll be right back i think someone's
uh okay cool
um
um refresh refresh the topic since i just got distracted so what i'm what i'm pointing to is
how the mind behaves when it's knocked out of its um
hmm what did you call it you said hyper vigilance oh vigilance ambiguity predictions right when its
ability to make predictions is taken away right and so that's why i mentioned an accident
yes i think that's one of the closest um
to actually to be honest the only time i've really fully experienced that kind of state of mind
is after some sort of accident um
um oh god oh um i would suggest that humor makes use of setting you up in a sort of predictive loop
and then shattering it yes good humor yes good good comedy is like this um
um that also explains i had an experience earlier today um
so today was pool therapy and the therapist was asking if i've ever been in a
sensory deprivation tank oh right yes and he was like what was your immediate response and i was
like to laugh and he kind of didn't understand and i was like i don't know anytime my consciousness is
really surprised like doesn't know what to do with it that's my first reaction well the therapist that
was helping us today there's always two people in the pool with me um he's an intern so he doesn't have
a lot of experience yet with people in my situation and they had me um with my legs like in a horizontal
position trying to push myself off of the wall and his expectation is that i'm not going to be able to
do that which is understandable um and he felt me start pushing and his immediate response was to laugh
and the other therapist didn't get why he was laughing and i was like oh no i totally understand
why he's laughing because he didn't expect that at all so wonderful i'm glad you said that because
that's kind of what i was trying to point to is
yeah it might be that liberation is actually liberation from expectation prediction vigilance
right right right like like real liberty means you're just no longer engaged in that
bullshit anymore right right maybe that's what being authentic actually means or something right
you've dropped your yeah you've dropped your structured game right right but it's it's our mind it's not
it's not i mean
so it's finding loopholes to like how do i get out of that thing anyways yes that's exactly what i was
trying to often um when people are trying to not do something i think they're making uh
a they're having some confusion because it's almost it seems to me and maybe this is one of my pattern
fucking beliefs come on um do something else instead do something that is better just do a thing and
this is the other thing that i really want to emphasize is if if you want to change the world or
you want to give people an experience of something amazing that they themselves are or can become you have
to get them doing something don't talk to them about give them a way to play together in that
direction and that will work because when they get a taste of the actual experience then they will know
and and they'll start to be like okay i don't i'm not going back to that other shitty thing i was doing
this i you know those people eating rocks these people eating peaches i get that they're religious
about eating rocks and they might punish me if i you know show them a peach or whatever but these
people over here eat peaches i'm going with them you know um and so yeah i think that those those
are important things to remember
try to be brave and not fill that gap
me too
that's all i've got
once i start making face noises there's no end to it
all i've got is a big sun that's it beautiful
so grateful so grateful every time we get to play together and try to see and remember
and for whatever brought us together i'm super happy i'm always here if you want to just talk or
explore or yell at me whatever whatever you got
thank you darren thank you amber all right we'll talk soon i look forward to that all blessings to you
be dear heart good night
you
you
