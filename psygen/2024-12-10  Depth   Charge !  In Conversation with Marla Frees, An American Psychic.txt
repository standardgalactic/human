i'm all up for laughter everyone always says this at the beginning of things um
that they're super excited and i'm i'm super excited a lot of the time but i'm i'm really
i've been a little bit nervous um about our conversation but i'm sure everything's going
to go swimmingly as they say i don't get so grateful to have you here and for some time
together thank you darren i really appreciate your invitation thank you my deep pleasure and honor
i have recently finished a cursory a rather rapid reading of your book and i was astonished at your
skillfulness and the humanity of your writing it it encompasses a life and and the features of of
your childhood your upbringing your development as a woman as a human as a being um as a mind uh so
beautifully um as a writer i was deeply impressed uh oh it very much captivated me thank you thank
you there was nothing chore-like about that experience well um thanks i i have to say that
writing a memoir is one of the most indulgent things anyone could ever do but for me it became
it was a healing journey to share those stories but what i found out in the six years that it's been out
is that people really resonated with it because they saw themselves in the book that's why i basically
wrote it to get people to see their own journey to see the difficulty of the trauma the drama and the
transformation so it means a lot to me that you said what you've said so thank you i definitely had
that experience as well in reading it it made me reflect in new ways on my own history um development
thought concern trauma drama all of the things you mentioned so it's it's a beautiful and very heartful
mirror there's there's every aspect of what we might hope for there's um there's like trouble and
confusion and confusion and storminess and revelation and reflection and revision and forgiveness and
transcendence um it's uh it's a beautiful pain to the arc of a human life and and how it escapes
the traps that may seem to surround it in its origins so so amazing
well that's that's quite a review and it's also quite an active i like to look at act active um
thoughts like i've been working on with people because you know i i now do the work that i do
constantly and that is actually helping people with their own trauma and drama into the transformation
for whatever reason but i've been working with the statement i choose love which actually has a
resonance with it so if you don't mind saying it with me or on the count of three saying it together
because i want i want you to tell us what saying these words mean because it it shifts us in some way it's
a choice so you're asked i'm not making you do it but i'd like for you to do it with me and see what
happens okay absolutely on the count of three one two three i choose love
it's funny you know there's a there's a technical issue with zoom which is that we cannot both speak at
the same time um i feel choked up me too i have to work not to cry right now and that feels fine and good
um i'm grateful for it
it's not merely a reminder it's a kind of a resurrection right it's a it's a resurrection of
my heart my innocence the original um purposes that i think drew me into incarnation
um and as children uh these these features of our i think both our previous being and our future being
uh they are alive in the most astonishing and vital ways and over time
um as we undergo the processes of in languaging and enculturation
which are extremely confusing for children i think and really don't make sense
many of those uh initial the character and the spirit of our origin uh they get occluded
and really this is perhaps a fundamental feature of trauma is how those in how those occlusions are
introduced and how they are sustained well as you know and your your audience doesn't know this so i'll
just give a little background but i um i'd worked as an actress for 25 years and i was stalked by someone
and my antennas blew out of my head and they never went back down but in the process of all of it i
in in writing the book it really was a reflection it was an understanding that the purpose of my coming in
was to make a difference which is usually what most of our our purpose is but the former lifetime
before this one kind of came along with me and i because of what's going on in our country right now
um i'm just gonna share with you the idea of what that was i've and i've i you and i met because of a
very famous um podcast that was has been going on for many many years with whitley streber and i was a
co-host of that program for for basically 10 years but the dynamic of the bleed through of the former
lifetime is a little i didn't talk about it in the book much but the dynamic was having experiences
with brian weiss who's written many lives many masters he's written nine books he's basically the
father of of past life regression and my experience with him um had me accessing different lifetimes and
this last one feels as though i was in the camps and i didn't know which camp i was in it just was
during the holocaust so the dynamic of that was being in a room with a doctor who basically said he
was going to do something to my arm that would either make me very sick or it would kill me
and i dying's not a problem you know it's literally living right living is the issue the dying is easy
because i remember feeling his feelings the nurse's feelings my own feelings i could feel the dynamics
before i was actually leaving my body and as i'm leaving my body i heard myself screaming
your hate will not destroy my love
what a beautiful medicine you make in the world in my own heart right now just so profound
you know i'm uh i'm an unusual chimera because i'm very intellectual and often that means unavailable
to emotion or sensitivity or empathy but in my case i i sort of have both wings even though i i lean into
the intellectual one because it feels safer um i read that story
and it's hard to imagine the sense of that young girl
and it's hard to think about how she's going to be able to control in that situation without really
just kind of losing it her aloneness the um the catastrophic distance of a caring loving protective
presence right how that's just been completely evicted from this scene and it's almost as if she's
she's literally with demons
and still the courage of her heart yeah well what i've learned in the last 14 years because i've been
looking through the lens of science at work at being a psychic and being a medium all of the cliche
terminology out there that's why i call myself transformational consciousness coach
but i utilize the the terminology on the book as calling the book american psychic understanding that
the the the the basis from which we all come is a foundation that is born out of blood and the
elevation in our consciousness here on this lifetime we're we had to do this ourselves darren we had to do
this and we had to take our own path and be hidden for as long as we could be hidden and then come out
when we needed to come out i mean what's more um what's i mean i was living in a world of make-believe
for so many years because that's what would help my mother try and love me anything to make her happy which
was basically getting on stage or getting into the television to so that she could cloak herself with my
successes as as many narcissists and ill people will do that's how i lived in order for me to express
myself and that's one of the things about trauma it's one of the things that i had mentioned to you i
wanted to talk about was healing the dynamic of whatever abuse was going on in anyone's life whether it
was like my father came back from world war ii and became an alcoholic my mother was crazy you know the
children of of war torn families we're just looking for love hey hey love me love me oh i'll get you a
drink you'll love me oh i'll go on to tv so i look good and you can be happy about that that's what i'll do
we all morph ourselves into trying to be loved right that's what we want and as adults we are now owning
loving that loving ourselves and helping others find that that journey for themselves
there's a in in human existence it's as if we are uh metaphorically we are walking in a metropolis
of skyscrapers of the absence of humanity and they're like these leviathans and often
the one one you know some of the leviathans are our parents right and the irony is that we seek
we naturally seek their approval and love
when the surface they present to us
when the surface they present to us may be evacuated of all that we hope for but in their interior
there is this unquenchable adoration of us that we cannot sense it's this occlusion again right and
so the love is there what we're seeking is sort of its affirmation or validation or verification
and then the parents are often so resistant uh to to demonstrating that when they are right
many parents aren't um everyone's uh life situation path origin is unique i honor you know i honor that
and yet um nearly all of us have these uh
uh these sort of clogs in the flow of our heart and our desire for the adoration of our parents and
it strikes me that part of what we're seeking is um i mean there's a huge backstory here
yeah something comes with us into birth i don't have to say exactly what it is but it's not ordinary
it's an intelligence or a family of intelligences right and then as that becomes occluded we transfer
the expectation of that companionship that reassurance that encouragement that acknowledgement
we transfer that onto our parents and now you know it's like you said you know death isn't really the
problem getting born now you're going to have some trouble living well i i this is really great pr for
reincarnation because as as i've discussed with many of my clients and friends how could we know that
something was wrong in our family at such a young age unless we had lived before it's like i remember
holding onto the sink in the bathroom screaming being very angry at my situation like being mad at god
madacon what the f am i doing in this family what the hell is going on and realizing that there is
i come from someplace else where there's benevolence or some other awareness and okay here i am
and i think we recognize this on a daily basis now that we're older it's like oh damn what do i have
to do now what what what am i have to healing now what am i gonna have to heal inside of me now
it's an ongoing revelation
okay i just want to say something back to you to acknowledge what you were just sharing there which
is crucially important how could it possibly be that a child recognizes injustice unless they come from a
place where it's absent or uncommon like what the hell i love i love that phrase what the hell what the
hell well yes and that's what you know that's what the dead taught me i think the reason that i ended up
being um a spokesperson for dead people is because i didn't have a lot of dead people around me growing
up as a child i didn't have a lot of loss there were animals that i lost but i didn't have people i
didn't have a lot of people losing me or me losing people all my grandparents were dead by the time that
i was born so that dynamic was so interesting because i had no i had no context around the grief of losing
someone but if we start to look at our families darren there is this huge deprivation of love
and that's what creates the trauma in their lives and that's one of the reasons that i've been in my
own laboratory exploring the nature of consciousness surviving death how that is much more prevalent now
than it's ever been understanding it but i i'm boiling it down into a science conversation
which does not take the love away in any way shape or form does not take the specialness away of life
but it's information that we are all able to tap into because it's information yeah every time you speak
like i have eight things in my mind like it just awakens these little flowers right and um
you know i've been fascinated by death since i was very young um some might have called me morbidly
fascinated in a sense uh if death were a woman she's been my girlfriend since i was little oh that's
a quote that's a good quote write that one down that's that's the title of your book that was my
girlfriend um i tried to revive her all the time i was always chasing her skirts
or her spirit yes indeed so there's a few things i want to say here first is just autobiographically
i don't remember exactly when i was introduced to the writing of edgar allen poe but i was hyperlexic
as a child so i was reading adult books very early and we had some poe on the shelf and i was absolutely
fascinated with it um i've just recently finished memorizing the raven for probably the third time
in my life but um where i want to go here is weirder um over the past perhaps 10 months in conversations
with a number of people including a young woman who was recently paralyzed in a car accident and i have
her permission to speak about her situation just to be clear um i began to think very differently about
death and also it's quite common for me to take what humans think and just flip it around i just
invert that thing and by the way this happens to be common in science as well often we will get the
wrong idea we'll get it backwards first and then we'll do like a 180 and have like an aha moment one
example of that is one of our clients in my scientific editing business was writing about um writing
papers about osteoclasts and osteoblasts these are the cells that build and tear down set to tell you
excuse me tear down bone and um obviously the scientists started out with the bias that it must
be the builders that are this is actually relevant to death and life it must be the building cells that
have you know they're the smart ones they tell the other cells what to do and they build things they're
obvious the makers got to be the good you know the best thing so we presumed that that's sort of the
the precedence of effectiveness and capacity and intelligence was on the cells that build them
and so we broke papers for 10 years as if this were the case and then suddenly to everybody's
surprise they discovered that the things that build stuff are essentially just robots following the
instructions laid down by the by the cells that tear bone down got it and so what if something like
that were going on in life what if it's not the builders that are intelligent what if they're
following the instructions of death what if orcs oh go ahead i can see you oh no i know i'm i'm fascinated
by this um also along those lines let's just look at this let's look at the um the dna dynamic here
this has fascinated me for the last couple of years um do you know you know who bruce lipton is right
he wrote the bod a book biology of belief so here was bruce lipton running around teaching the dna
determinism model to college students in med school so he had that down and then all of a sudden he got
compelled to look at stem cell research and found out that the outside of the cell there's a liquid
protein and what do you do on a liquid protein that looks like crystal it's like silicon valley it's
like time watches you imprint information on those crystals so the outside of the structure of the cell
was a place that was imprinted by the environment and he was like oh my god he had this you know come
to jesus moment of understanding that it was not necessarily the dna that made the whole dynamic
it was the petri dish that you put each cell in giving it a different way of eating different way
of of absorbing so it became in my consciousness the idea of thank you god for the many petri dishes
that i chose to put myself in so i left home got out of there or even when i was in home i was in the
woods or else i was in school or else i was on the stage reading or in the library each place and for
any of our listeners here each place was an amazing different petri dish that our consciousness would
invest us in we were and this is where the spirit or consciousness or the dynamic of the acorn you know
the whole dynamic of having the daemon everything inside that acorn that we come in with the cellular
structure of of not just dna but an experience packet given to us by the consciousness that
sent us here in the first place that experience packet has all the information in there maybe you
and i have less hair than most people then i mean whatever but we got other we got other skills right
so but the dynamic of that is the different petri dishes that consciousness that spirit that the that
whatever was in that experience packet put us in different situations because we were compelled
to go there and just so people know especially people in trauma that they are choosing let's say that
you're addicted and you have all these issues well there's there's this opportunity here to choose
another petri dish
another petri dish
that in itself is the saving grace of our dna
wow again so many amazing insights are flowing into my mind just as i listen to your
inspired
anamnesis right unforgetting
unforgetting yeah um and one of them is i've been fascinated by biology most of my life
i have 50 fascinations it's not you know it's not a thing it's better than 50 shades of gray is that
yeah well i've been i've been less less explorational in that particular domain but
you know much to my sometimes regret but um what i was what came to me while you were speaking and in a way
i have a kind i have a variety of features
that are actively psychic they're not the same species uh that you have in practice
um
but somehow when someone is carrying something that they're incapable of quite articulating that's
what lights up my that's what lights up my peculiar uh like what whatever we might call them um i want
to be careful about what to call them but something that occurred to me while you were speaking is that
um there's this fabulous video which i'll send you a link to later it's called the life of a cell it's a
it's a simulation of what happens on the surface layer of cells it is absolutely mind-blowing i love
that thank you and uh what occurs to me is what if so yeah this is the thing we think that the dna
is the blueprint right because we're uh we're engineers and we make machines
um which by the way aren't really or very organic they're not like organisms organisms
a whole produces a whole there's two parts right it's not little parts being assembled although it
can be viewed that way and what occurred to me about while you were speaking is that
the entire ancestral family and what i'll refer very generally to as origin which are the
what we could think of as the divine intelligences right they kind of form a membrane around our soul
and that membrane leads us around tropically right attractively um probably electromagnetic the
some sort of magic in electromagnetism which is what the cell uses to negotiate the the uh boundary
between the interior and the exterior of the cell it uses electromagnetism uh well that's part of the
story it uses structure as well but um what if what if those divine beings and our ancestors and so on
that what if they are the membrane around our soul and they're leading us into contexts where we can get
both the trouble and the bliss that we need to grow and heal and become a light pole
well you just use a couple of really interesting words here um the light pole uh there is a experience
in the book that i i talk about where i have this amazing first uh impression of having a past life
regression with brian weiss i was in the middle of a boat and uh on my way to ensenada mexico with brian
weiss and i thought i was there to talk to one of the the um the psychics who happened to work with
law enforcement because i was working with law enforcement at the time this was in the early 90s
and um i have an experience that i'm not on this earth i'm actually looking at the earth and i'm being
told that i have to come back and my attitude was oh f that i'm not going back there but no
i was literally being um prepped to come back and they showed me going back and forth on the united
states um light going back and forth like on the east coast on the west coast and what happened was
i'm not going to go into the whole conversation about that but i was getting i was cast on everybody
loves raymond as a guest star role and i show up on the set and i go to the uh the assistant director
and all of a sudden this woman runs out of the seats when we were in rehearsal on this on the
sound stage and she says oh my god i had a dream about you and i'm thinking i am not famous i'm a guest
star on this show nobody really knows who i am and she said they showed me you they showed me you
you were here you're supposed to and she pulls out this piece of paper starts writing on it on a table
where we're getting ready to do um the table read and she's drawing the united states and she said
and she's drawing the back and forth of of being on on the east coast and west coast and light
she says you have to pull light
i'm like poll light what the hell does that mean i hadn't even started pole dancing at that time in
my life it wasn't any i had no idea what this meant but she basically recounted my past life regression
that i had had in the bottom of a boat with brian weiss it was right there i don't even remember this
woman's name i write about it in the book but the dynamic of this was the idea of being like a like
a flagpole for information yes yes this brings up another astonishing thing which is that from my side
of my own experience it feels well i think you know because i'm i'm sort of used to thinking this way
that i'm doing something amazing right i'm i'm doing this amazing thing right when i when i can
sort of recover from within someone else something and and actually what's often going on is that
i'm seeing features of myself that have been occluded through them uh but the thing that struck
me about what you just said is you know if somebody's ever experienced hypnosis
right they're likely to to to naturally think that the hypnotist has this sort of supernatural power
right the powers in the hypnotist when in fact uh there's a big truck outside making some squeaky noises
but when in fact um what's going on is in it's in the person in trance and wouldn't it be strange to
discover that what we think of what we might think of as for example me being psychic is actually
the response to the psychism of others that lights us up that like somehow what we're doing is actually
being done to or through us by this intense charge around another person what are your thoughts well i love
that because the nature of trauma is it's um it's a vibration it's a frequency that we as children
are internalizing it's not it's not necessarily what's outside of you it's what happens inside of
you it's like what gabor mate says who is a expert in trauma it's it's the dynamic of what your response
is to what's happening inside of you it's not necessarily the trauma itself it's what it's doing
to the inside of your cells it's it's how you you are percolating how you are responding whether you
are responding in a submissive fright or a frightened way it's your response inside the body so it is a
frequency right so this frequency makes a lot of us hypersensitive so it's like if you had a guitar
right now and i had a guitar and i plucked one of the strings that exact string on your guitar would
vibrate so it is it to me it is an ongoing process of being pulled to a certain vibration in order to
heal it that's why many of us are drawn to a partner that is similar to one of our parents
where we have to work out some of those dynamics and it's usually the person with the most pathology
that we are drawn to you know i mean it's interesting i understand the incoming uh president
because i understood my mother's pathology as a narcissist i never hated that uh individual i i
understand the the problem behind it so that made me um that keeps me compassionate on a bigger level
about pathologies oh oh yes me too okay so so around this resonance we are pulled to the resonance
we're also uh psychically being shown um sometimes it's because when i work with somebody i'll just i'll
just sit on that sofa over there and i will see things i don't know what i'm seeing i'm tapping into the
information of the person that i'm working with so i can feel a wound that happened in when they were
four or 12 or 18 or 21 which is the which is the inception of the wound um darren that helps me
understand and helps the person that i'm working with go oh yeah that happened way back then but they're
still dealing with it right now so they are they're having that um as we would call it the cosmology
effect of of the of the of the family dynamic that is still coming in and it's not to be judgmental of
it it's just to look at it it's just to bear witness to it because if psychologists and therapists
do this do this all the time and um and i work with a lot of them because they are actually getting
downloads and they don't know what to do with the download whether it's a dead person or it's their
own awareness they are accessing information about the person that happened a long time ago but one of
the things that i've learned in my my older years is that the information that i get that seems like oh i
got a sign here i got a sign here i have i have to do something about it no it's just a sign so it's
kind of like the the dynamics of chunks of my life where i went oh my god this is so amazing this is a
sign i have to be with this person well the information is being delivered to me that doesn't
mean that i have to marry them that doesn't mean that i have to do something it's just oh let's just
look at it and go oh isn't that interesting this is part of what we are trained to toward in meditative
traditions right don't you don't have to change anything observe sense it be there be present um
do i need this do i need this it's here for a reminder it's here for an awareness it's here for
us to possibly as you and i are discussing so that someone else might listen to this and go
oh yeah i'm dealing with this right now
i'm reminded again by our proclivity to transform as if we are like um a vibrating shape right we are
like a a thing that is going in and out and it's changing how its shape and then someone comes along
and says or does something and we change morph we morph yeah we morph um this is particularly
obvious to me in one of my practices which is uh i do tai chi pushing hands so this is where you're
very intimate with someone your hands are on each other's body and they're playing with your balance
yes yes i understand and the moment that someone puts their hand on your body especially with men
yeah men are very competitive the urge is to tense up right to try to resist and what you learn over
time which is a very difficult and counterintuitive thing is not only to not tense but to release
and a really good release is unstoppable weirdly it doesn't make any logical sense but a really good
release when someone pushes on you they fall over um so i was just noticing how when we come into
contact with each other there's sort of signals or energies are transferred and we both change shape
right and then we sort of evaluate that shape changing oh yes this is the person i'm supposed
to marry or get that away from me or you know all these things there's there are intelligences there
um to i just want to circle back briefly to to death it has recently occurred to me that the idea now
i'm not trying to say what is true but perhaps what is useful or interesting that much and this could
change throughout our life right like in the beginning it might be our birth that's influencing us
but then at a certain point maybe this flips maybe it flips around and we're being informed
from after our lives right it occurred to me at some point that perhaps our affinities and disaffinities
what we desire and what we reject right are actually death our our future death dripping back into this
moment right the wisdom the the the perception from beyond this life leaking back in time into us now
and i found that such a fascinating thing to play with um i about your experience there's a few
questions i i want to ask you before i lose track of them and one of them is the peculiar relationship
of time to your sensing and the intelligence that you use in your work whatever you might like to say
about that i'd be fascinated to hear
well the caveat of how i work is this i am able to access information for your highest good that is my
intention one of the things that we were talking about regarding what we wanted to talk about
is the power of intention so let's just do a little matrix conversation to make everything sort of
neutral so that it's not organized religion so that it's not about necessarily belief system
but let's just go down the road of this this is the computer we're we're in a simulation a reality
it's a reality frame we're just we're in a game we're playing this game um and just the idea that
we're here for a certain amount of time we have these you know these tools that come with us like
super mario brothers or whatever it is and we we get to move into this so it has been my awareness
and it's funny because you know our phones that we deal with all all the time it's like we look at
this phone and go all this information but what if that was the system that's working with us
what if this we are in a computer simulation what if this is you know what this is a system you know
when we play solitaire on our phone i'm always amused by this because i'm playing a game and then
i don't necessarily know what to do in this situation and there's a hint button and it jumps
up and down move this card here move that card there and i'm like oh my excuse me need
i was in trouble i needed something i asked the system for it it gave it to me
i like him to say that that's kind of how i work with my life and this is how i help others see that
their intention around getting some assistance is always delivered maybe not the way you want it
but actually how you need it you know people want money oh if i could just get a chunk of money
blah blah blah well you get an opportunity for a job that you might not necessarily like but if you
look at that job then the money is right there excuse me and you might have to do something you didn't
necessarily want to do but it's like oh it's right there i have the opportunity so i've been given what
i've asked for but we have this weird thing inside of us as children which it's like
i want it this way i want it that way so there is this juvenile person that shows up oftentimes excuse
me someone will ask me marla how old are you right now when you're when you're speaking and you know a
a dear friend and i'm like 10 and and i i will say to my clients too can we just grow you up to 30
in the next 30 minutes and we look at it as the opportunity to go oh we okay we've got some wisdom
here so so the timing of seeing something in the future we are really quantum leaping something darren
we are seeing something in the future that could really be right here right now we just attach the
the photons the filaments it's like it's like driving around going just get me the best parking
space i intention it and then i collapse the wave there's the parking space it's our it's our it's the
need that we have to be present to what we need asking for what we need and it coming to us so i might
work with someone and i see something you know like someone i spoke to someone the other day that said
well you did i wanted to work with you again because you did say that john would be having a
challenge in january and and when i worked with you two years ago i thought it was that january and i
said i don't remember it's information for you and she said well it was the next january when he actually
did pass and she said but i had the awareness that you had the awareness so i was present for it
i was prepared on some level so intrinsically we do feel these things unless we are actively searching
for it we might not find it so when you talk about a time frame and like time i need to see time in a
linear fashion for the way that i work because i'm i'm interested it's my intention to bring information
in for your highest good so if we're looking at a job someone might see that they have a window a
framework for a window but we're always opening different windows and different doors i usually am
shown information that doesn't come at you like this it comes from underneath yeah which is really
interesting because it's it's not what anybody was thinking right it's just seeing it from a
different perspective instead of the fear you know all the chaos i love to look at the lowering the
the entropy which is heart-centered forget the chaos that's like it's like fumes it's like gasoline fumes
that can make us sick but if we reduce the chaos into being low entropy into being heart-centered
then maybe our awareness is no longer about fear it's about what's possible here
so we get curious that's basically i think i want to call my next book curious um it very well may be
that that is a choice that will present things to us because we're asking for it
and we're looking at being curious so the dead thing excuse me the dead person conversation is not about
fear because we've done it many many many many many many times and the weird thing is i'm saying this for
the for whoever is listening to this it's an odd thing that happens to me when i know that a friend
is on death's door i all i always start to feel the energy and the joy of them leaving the body
because they're going to be free it's most of the time that when people are sick
i can feel that the legacy of them being in joy or being in relief is going to happen soon so i take
that legacy and i'm like i'm going to live the best i possibly can because you've taught me so much
i'm going to be this i'm going to be that and sometimes i don't know that they're dying and
it just happened this last week i felt a girlfriend of mine that i've not spoken to in a while i sent
her something about a week and a half ago i wanted to connect i wanted to bond i wanted to hear from
her i wanted to laugh i wanted to be in communication it was on me and i just decided to go to her facebook
page because i hadn't heard back from her since i sent her that that email a week and a half ago and
she had died two days earlier than me going to her facebook page i felt that with a man who was um
who was a therapist and used to we used to talk about relationships and he would always contact me
in the next relationship that he was going to be in and i could feel that he was in another relationship
and i felt it for months and i didn't feel good about it and i thought this is so weird
and i went to his facebook page and he had passed two months earlier
so what most people aren't really paying attention to this is how my life is so just as a reminder as you
inspire me with that psychicness that happens between people this is how i live right so we
if we can inspire listeners or people who are watching this to just start to think and be curious
about why am i thinking about bob i better look at bob i better contact bob and maybe bob is in trouble
maybe bob's having a great experience but to be curious about why we are thinking about bob
and sending bob love which is the best we can do i mean i think about my friend who died and i just
am so grateful i mean she was a major contributor to theater and she had a mind that was so amazing and
she handled oh you know handling businesses and opening grants and all of these things that she
was capable of and i could feel that coming through in my communication once i knew that she was on the
other side i'm like okay let's open the door and she started telling me what not to do how not to feel
what i was going through you know just as how she would be in life
because the issues that we have as humans stay with the tissues in death so consciousness moves forward
there's no more pathology imagine being in trauma because your mother your father used to beat you
or whatever it is that goes that stays in the body the awareness and the memory of that goes
into consciousness but it's not the same thing it's wanting to heal it's wanting you and i to go forward
and talk to a friend about losing a friend it's literally it all boils down to the love
i'm sorry that was a huge download but that that's really what it's all all about it's all about the love
there's no need to apologize we're totally here for that i'm here for that exactly what you're
whatever you have um i'm i've signed on all right so yeah no need for that we signed on years ago and
i'm just i'm thrilled that you just got back in touch with me so thank you oh yeah it was it was timely
quote unquote um you know i i doubt that among my listeners we're gonna find hard skeptics right
probably just not those people are not commonly listening to my podcasts um but they're probably
there might be people who okay yeah here's another thing i want to turn around
we have these ways of talking about existence and life and death so for example we say well we're
all connected i think it's kind of the opposite of that we're actually one thing distributed into
like the same way these fingers they're not connected they're the same thing right they're one
thing in different aspects um and similarly uh we think well this is hilarious um there's a there's
a bunch of things that i find confusing and one of them is that minds are for thinking because it seems
to me that what minds are actually for is intimacy they're for coming together and becoming communal
right like linking up and so the thinking is sort of a symptom of what happens when we're isolated
right rather than what minds are for which is what the sort of waking mind would like us to leave no
minds are for thinking it let you make these little objects you manipulate them correctly and
it's an engineering task right make the map and fill it in and get all the things correct
um there's a place for that right there's a there's a there's a little piece of the pie where
that's the right thing to do but most of the pie is actually about intimacy unforgetting insight
learning development healing love growth remembering literally re-membering and
again there's there's another question i have for you about time i think we're trained to think about
time and think in ways that might be somewhat confused um did it ever occur to you that time might be a
being or an intelligence well i i think of everything as consciousness so if i look at life as this is
all a reflection of consciousness and growing all the weird things that we got really interested in
like ufos and uaps we can talk i do want to talk about that but all that is to inspire our consciousness
to expand i mean um it's hard to think about the coliseum it really wasn't that long ago that people
were you know blood lusting over people fighting in the coliseum and there's a faction of consciousness
that is still blood thirsty and um that's a level of consciousness uh we all go through these
experiences that teach us things and oftentimes death and illness is what makes us go inward and start
to feel and think and have so much pain and that way we start to reach outward this is what was happening
to me as a child this larger consciousness system that most people call god or spirit or the universal
consciousness saw my trauma saw my upset i was screaming and praying before i knew what prayers were i was in
i mean i have memories from the sense of being born i have memories at such young age because i was supposed
to remember some people don't remember their childhoods because it's not helpful but here we are and
consciousness is is what we are so these avatars we could just go to the avatar conversation this is an
avatar consciousness comes in you know i've talked with scientists and people who are consciousness experts
um the the consciousness of a child is doesn't necessarily come into that child maybe not until i don't
know the sixth or seventh month there are lots of questions around all of it i mean we don't put
children in freezers because we know that they would die but the but a zygote or an embryo that has been
fertilized are in the is in the freezer because that's what keeps them alive you know you don't have
there's lots of ways to think about how the cell the structure the being the baby there's so much going on
around you know consciousness around um embryos or or or babies etc but so many babies opt out
and there there are miscarriages probably i know women that miscarriage numerous times before they
would ever have the child and that might be something wrong in the body of the female it might
be something wrong in the environment of where that consciousness is coming in going hell this doesn't
look as good as i thought it was gonna i'm not staying for this or something wrong with the
child inside the mother it's like um i'm leaving i'm gonna come back i'll come back in the family
another time but it's not time for me to come in i mean there's lots of ways to think about this stuff
that people are judging others and need to be right about this or that when in fact we have to be curious
yes we just have to be curious and it's my experience in death that if there is a desire
from the consciousness of a dead person that wants to make amends somehow or talk to their living
relatives they will find me and they will put me in front of someone it's not them looking me up and
reading my book or anything like that no it's me standing in a line at trader joe's talking to this
tall skinny guy that kind of looked like he was having a rough time and he was this is a true story
about alec who basically was standing in line right before the pandemic we didn't know whether to wear
masks but i i said you look like you need a jacket you know i could feel like i was a mother presence and
he said i'm just having the worst time my my mother and father had both died they died of a
certain kind of lung cancer and i've just been ravaged by thinking about their death and my wife
is going to have a baby and and i said well let's talk about it he said he actually said i've been
thinking about talking to someone about it i'm like hmm so we sat we were on a bench and we were waiting
40 minutes and he tells me things and i said well i'm actually a good person to talk to about this
and i explained who i was and and he said well i'm interested in this and i said well i can feel the
presence of your mother so i'm tapping into the presence of someone that he wants to talk to
and i can feel her coming to me and i'm like okay do you want to go there because i can feel this
so i spoke from his mother's perspective and i could feel her looking through my eyes now that's
the information of this deceased mother that's the information of the father that's deceased
but they came in as a benevolent source to help their son prepare for the birth of the child
and they did it in such a loving way like the mother would talk about him being a musician and talk
about the fact that he shouldn't be eating gluten all of these wonderful weird things and the father
was saying yeah i'm playing golf on a utica golf course and apparently that's where they lived and
that's what they used to do together i don't you know i never know what i'm hearing or seeing or
feeling at the time i'm just listening but what actually happened darren and i bring this up because
this is this is this is the depth of how consciousness that survives death wants to continue to love
their loved ones they came in they gave him this support they gave him this love and what happened was
he calls me five months later the baby is born and then he says and marla i'm so glad i had that
communication with my parents trying to help me get strong because my wife has been diagnosed with the
same lung cancer that both of my parents died of and so we spent the next year working together as a
family they lived near me getting prepared for this woman's death as he had to take on the responsibility
of raising that daughter himself and so there's a reason there's a season there's a reason for the season
but the idea that you have these we all have fanciful awarenesses just my talking to you about this my friend
will inspire and build that bridge to the deceased as well as the living for you to be able to have a
conversation with someone like me or not or your own conversation with consciousness to explore your
connection and it's all about the love
so there's something that's been spinning in the back of my mind and it just it just re resurfaced
um it's one of those things that we might have backwards
um we say you know consciousness survives death
it's actually we got the opposite problem consciousness is not surviving life
right the consciousness is problem with it after death right it's doing fine over there yeah yeah
the problem is over here and so you're like midwifing the re-intrusion of the consciousness that
it does you know we have again we have this backwards you think like well when you die you're
you're dead right the consciousness dies no no it's the opposite consciousness dies when you're born
right it dies into incarnation and that's what requires the healing and the light pole to bring
the light that's obviously out there before and after birth right back into life and reawakening it here
it's it's quite a process you know when we see a flower bloom
when we see someone caring for another which is really what this whole cycle is we lose our way
when we don't think of others
we lose our way when we don't care about others
we lose our way when we think that the trappings of things
are more important or our bank account is more important i gave up a career really financially
successful career because i could not pretend anymore i had to leave that world it was more
important to me it was an agent called me one day and said you know what happened to you and i said
what are you talking about she said you missed another callback this is the second time in the last
couple months and a callback for most people would understand that it's the actual opportunity in
front of directors and producers to get the job it's a very big deal she said what were you doing
and i said i was talking to the president of toyota and his dead father
excuse me i just burped and she said well you need to make a decision you need to make a choice and i
did at that point because i realized that what was happening in healing darren between the deceased
father and this man who was president of this company was more important than whatever the job was
that i wasn't thinking about absolutely um there was a healing taking place yeah i mean you spoke in
your book of this thing that i think is probably extremely unfamiliar to most americans uh this this
activity if you will a kind of healing called psychic surgery
yeah none of us would we moderns be very unconvinced about if any of my listeners were skeptical of
something we're talking about they'd surely be skeptical of that but that you told was completely
convincing to me um not that it's my goal to see this is the other problem with thinking
uh we're inclined particularly men although women may have their own way of doing it and i'm not
i can't speak for them i'll let women speak for themselves you know yeah good good idea thank you
i mean my mother taught me this a long time ago like hey let's yeah yeah but um we're inclined to
dismiss things that we find uh a way to invalidate or that aren't true right yes yeah let me just be
really clear about something most of insight doesn't have to do with what's true it has to do with seeing
better the entire realm of science fiction which were the the sort of mothers and fathers of my mind
those authors uh they weren't talking about what what is true or not they were talking about seeing
right and psychism is a way of seeing um if we call it that uh it's amazing part of your life and how
you're in the world that i honor and absolutely trust um has nothing to do with my intellect it has to do
with my heart so it's not a matter of are these descriptions true yeah we're often
men particularly like if someone says something to us and we can immediately see a flaw
just throw that away that's not right i know what's right and blah blah blah blah blah and that
aspect of con of thought is not trustworthy again there's a tiny scope of reality in which it's useful
but what if it takes over the whole scope you get something like uh the incoming president
you get something like you get something like you get something like you get something like you're
you're soul retrieving people's spirits and their relationships and their physical health
their emotional well-being you are um organizing
the context sort of outside of time in a way or outside of ordinary linear time even if you
have to think in linear time in order to do what you're doing you're sort of reorganizing these things
not not for them but with them um in a way
that removes occlusions right so that flow and healing and love and memory and recognition
and also i think you also flip some things over right the whole death idea no those people aren't
gone they're gone over here they're not in the body right now there's they're right with i can see them
with you right just like they were standing there um so you know it also occurs to me that this idea of
psychism is kind of confused because it's almost like the opposite thing is going on everything is like
that and we're pretending it's not and so psychism is some special supernatural thing well right i i
agree with you there's a there's a need that i have to make the paranormal normal and that might take
the the flashiness and the specialness off of all of it but i really want to i need to tell you guys
that anybody that's listening to this is how what a snarky little skeptic i was about all of this
talk about skeptical i mean there were things that were happening to me in in childhood that
were bizarre and you know i started to pay attention to a couple of stuff but it wasn't like i woke up
and started seeing dead people all over the place no no no no no no no no no no no in fact i was so
snarky about it that when it actually did happen to me i took myself to all the therapists that i could
took took myself to clergy took myself to doctors and it happened because i was being stalked that
stalking dynamic and it blowing the the the antennas out of my head was was the event that made me
be in this dynamic of hearing from a dead woman who's telling me that who my stalker is and all of
that that that's what was happening and i literally thought i was really losing it but the psychic
part of this was that i was led because i my heart was which is 50 000 times stronger than the brain
actually it is the heart that was pumping and asking for help i mean praying whatever get me some
help here and i saw james von prague on television and i i got a call on the phone with a girlfriend
that says you know i can't get together with you this weekend i'm going to see james von prague and
i'm going to be in whatever the conversation was and i said is he the gay guy with the mustache that
thinks he's talking to dead people and she said yeah and i'm like i'm watching him on tv right now
so i went to see him and i went with this snarky attitude
but you know what i thought okay here it it's here i'm just going to embrace it i'm going to go
in there maybe i'm an investigative reporter maybe i'm whatever i'm i'm snarky whatever but after two
hours of listening to him and the things that were happening and looking for the plants in the room oh
they're going to raise their hand and they're going to have this thing i mean i went through it all
but i was so moved that i got home and got down on my hands and knees and said i don't know what this
dog in the dead business is but can you help me and and you know help me with that stalker
and i got answers and i was led i was led to the u.s military psychic spies to the remote viewers
who were calling themselves psychic spies who were basically doing all of this work and they were in
the government and they were in the faction of the government from the 60s to the 90s and i'm like oh
my god now i'm being trained by these guys thank god i was because it was a group of men and women
that had awareness that the psychic functioning of all of us is not paranormal it's normal
and i want to throw this conversation into the ufo thing because when i was with james
i started volunteering for him i because i didn't really think i was you know gifted in this way
until he put me in a class and that was another thing but i was in sedona with him and i was being
snarky and nasty well i'm gonna go out there and see these ufos and i was like i wore oh i spent all
this money on these clothes i better see some critters and i went out there and the guy handed
me a russian night to vision goggle thingy and i was looking up and i saw this dome-shaped skirt thing
and i'm like oh my god there's a ufo over there and i started scratching the lens of the thing to
make sure that there wasn't a picture on it and i'm telling you we lost time this goes back to the
psychic surgery thing we lost time i don't remember what happened after that james and i talked about
this years ago we don't really know what happened that evening we ended up in a bar so those things
were expanding my consciousness the ufo dynamic the psychic surgery thing was expanding my consciousness
and to just to you know to tell your listeners or viewers about the psychic surgery i was in a room
with a bunch of people there were a lot of mediums in the back sending energy to this guy who wasn't
john of god he was um dr fritz you know i think he was a world war one german soldiers i mean i don't
remember doctor can't remember right now i'd have to look it up myself but he touched something inside
of me and i thought he was i felt he was inside my body it was weird and then he moved his hand and i
heard like a vacuum seal and he moved on to the next person and we got out of that room and i saw this
scar that looked like a scar so he had done something and what happened to me was i could feel
people walking in front of me that third chakra was open and i could feel people and it was annoying
and it was it was a really interesting painful but an experience but the ufo thing is another dynamic
and i just want to touch on this briefly if you don't mind um you know i still am in touch with
people within the ufo community and chris bledsoe is has become basically the father of uap dynamic ufo
because it's an ongoing uh presence that he is doing every single day at his home and other
places now but chris bledsoe's book ufo of god is as has been out and it's in different languages and
i met him two years ago when this was really coming to fruition and i was a part of that with
him at the monroe institute i'm so fortunate that i've had this experience and he actually mentions
me at the end of the book but the point is he is an ongoing experience or experiencer of pulling in
these energies and daily in the night time there's video after video of him on um instagram um the the
people of beyond skinwalker ranch have gotten a hold of him so many of your listeners might know about
this but he is an ongoing exploration of consciousness showing up and here we are and
we must be ready for it darren because it's here and it's a daily daily dose of information
that can't be denied that is has not been balked by science where science is basically embracing this
and saying well here it is what do you do with it over the past uh perhaps two years i think particularly
since um uh david grush came forth to the ig and did did his uh like 18 hour presentation and appeared
before congress and so forth and then people like uh diana walsh walsh pasulka and um you know jacques
valet who lives here in the city absolutely my roommate uh built his website and and just had
some back and forth with jacques um gary nolan uh and then some of the older names you know i could i
could sprinkle them on the cake but um so one of the things i just want to mention quickly so that
doesn't get lost is i i actually had a moment of like a surprise when i was reading your book and you
used um used the acronym ufo to refer to unknown family of origin brilliant brilliant so here's
something i wanted context but the context of that just so we stick to the context of this whole thing
i was in a meditation at the monroe institute and i went to a special place on the other side
at a level certain level that monroe teaches and it was john mack who wrote abduction he was the
clinical psychologist that had been part of this ufo conversation that was in this house that i ended
up going into and he says welcome this is the place where you can come in and he says you and i'm here
to teach you about ufos and family of origin i'm like oh my god and of course john mack is dead you know
then he's talking to me so i just want to give the context before you go on so yes absolutely so this is
a topic i've followed since childhood like probably five or six i read chariots of the gods when i was
seven you know so i was a little kid and it impressed me very deeply also it was very clear to me as a
child you know we have this feeling of injustice and so on and like what do the humans do the adults
are out of their minds what are they doing and so it at least occurs to some of us children that there
must be something actually intelligent somewhere somewhere right there must be an actual intelligence
somewhere and the sky is the obvious place to imagine it being especially if you've read a few
hundred science fiction stories like i had by the time i was 12 or whatever in any case
this is another thing i think the humans are very confused about and i just want to say a few things
about it i won't lecture i promise um
um it's really weird the way we're taught to think about being human because whatever we might be
the human portion is like this part of my pinky okay we first are time space itself is expressing itself
as organisms and worlds and stars and beings right it's not like humans spring up in a vacuum and
we're the important thing right we are an extension like a finger on the hand of being and so somehow
we've been trained to think differently like our thinking is really important or we're the important
thing and there are ways in which we are important i'm not dismissing those but
it occurred to me when speaking with amber again i had the most astonishing vision and as you know
although i haven't i don't generally speak at length about this but i think we spoke somewhat
about it in previous conversations you know i had like a nine month non-ordinary experience that was
absolutely mind-shattering and during that experience i had the experience of being psychic
i could look at someone know their name see their childhood if they were injured if they had a health
condition who who was going to die when they were going to die these kinds of things and um and many
many other things it was like being in a school all day every day with nh i and i don't talk about this
a lot i i prefer to talk about what i learned um but one thing that became blatantly obvious to me
was that what if the ancient humans were actually a vehicle for the embodiment of nh i and there was
sort of a developmental intimacy where they could experience physical embodiment which is alien to them
and we could experience the transcendental intelligence which is natural to them and all of this has been
forgotten and now we think there are gods and you know aliens and the thing the most alien thing in
the universe is humans let me be really clear about this we are alienated from pretty much as a species
from every form of life what we do in laboratories makes what we think aliens do during abduction look
like kindergarten like play-doh like playing playful games right think of what we do to the animals in
laboratories for research i mean it's just what are we thinking as a species of course there are
enlightened individuals and there are even enlightened you know relatively enlightened cohorts of humans
we're not all bad but at the group level when we when our humanity and our sense of origin and
intelligence is evacuated and we become mechanical right like that story that you told of the of your
previous existence in that girl in the laboratory in a nazi camp right so i think we're really confused
and i think we belong to time space nh i and us are the same thing we're just thinking about it in a
very peculiar way because it tends to be distant from our common experience yes and man i'm not saying man the
physical sex necessarily just man in general man woman man um there is this sophistry of needing to be
right me and fighting for this weird ego anomaly that i learned in landmark and in parts of est
where there is an image that is created which will defend your ego defend you defend it's a false
representation of you but it will defend you to the death it would rather be right than wrong when we
talk about the cosmology when we talk about our history we as as the united states of america we've got
some problems you know um coming from another country invading killing all the indians you know um
uh corralling them into uh into a dis-existence what's the word extension excuse me i'm not laughing at
that i'm laughing at myself not being able to pull a word in um but the extinction of the indigenous people
so that people so that so that a group of frightened people frightened white people came over here and just
decided to do this and then decided to buy other people to build the country as opposed to themselves
building it they you know they bought other people in order to do that and it is i mean there is something
really um well it's it's it's uh there's a word that i want and it's not a derogatory word it's
enterprising it's enterprising in that in that terminology but the fact that we don't want to
remember our history and what we've done is the problem you know the banning of books which is our
history the banning of stories which made us who we are this really is it's not really possible to do
without the annihilation of all humans because the stories will continue the stories started in our own
families and and and whatever has been shameful in our families has may possibly be been wiped out
you know oh one of my my great grant my great great grandmother looked cherokee and that would
have been really cool to be an indian you know some indian blood but no it's actually slave trader port
blood it's black and it's down south it's in my family and they didn't want to tell that story
so the shame of whatever this is it's the it's this false sense of self it's this thing that we
have developed to protect ourselves when in fact we are seeing it now and i'm glad we have the
opportunity to say it right now we have to be where we are in order to look at everything all of us are in
the same boat we might think differently doesn't matter what religion we're in doesn't matter we're
just humans but the point is we all are here in the united states and we have to learn we have to learn
what it is to be somebody else and we're having that opportunity over and over and over and over again
when will we learn there's a couple there's two things right on the tip of my mind the first one
is a joke that i heard that i thought was hilarious related to the the most recent election and and
someone said i can't remember who it was imagine that half the people on the titanic were pro iceberg
yes imagine that imagine that but but in the context of of ego i knew that i knew that was going to
happen well you get to be right we're all dead but you get to be right exactly okay so here's where i
want to talk about a feature you know my own work is deeply concerned with human cognition social cognition
and what happens in groups because i still have that that urgent need to highlight and perhaps
bring medicine for injustice right i want to know what's the origin of this your family
your family your family your family your family how mom and dad treated you how they treated each other
and you just go there and just have a field day with it i mean actually to be honest about my family
and there's there's i'm sure there's things that i've misremembered but i had a pretty idyllic
childhood i think i did idyllic childhood where i encountered injustice was outside my family
in other children in school in the teachers in watching humans kill each other on tv um that kind of
stuff and i mean there's a sort of there's a joke here i don't know if it's right i'll stay on track
for the moment so i work with a neuroscientist and i have for about almost 20 years now and i've been
fascinated with the brain neuroscience biology but particularly the relationship between the two
cerebral hemispheres yes yes got it and so there's this guy his name is yane mcgilchrist if you don't know
of him i'll send you a link later and his thesis is that our cultures are the um are like it's as if
we've got a just a left hemisphere right or now this is a bit disingenuous because the hemispheres
are usually always connected and the right mediates some of the features of what we could think of as
left hemisphere character but here's what i want to say what has become absolutely clear to me i'm not
saying that um again this isn't about truth it's about seeing there's a feature that arises in humans
in large groups it despises that organisms exist it doesn't want there to be any organisms those
cannot be controlled or manipulated it wants dead manipulable controllable objects it hates life
it hates intelligence it wants stupidity um because in a way it's like an inflated protector part
in internal family systems talk right it's terrified that anything can threaten its absolute sovereignty
over all phenomenon and so literally it will destroy anything to preserve its dominance right including
itself it's happy to it doesn't care even about its old its own survival what it cares about is its
dominance and this feature you can see it in the behavior of corporations you can see it in the
behavior of the prison military industrial complex you can see it in the behavior of nations you can see
it in some behavior organized religions yes i was just going to say churches whatever so this has become
a focus of mine trying to understand the origins of this and it's very clear that the the colonists who
came to the united states were first themselves compromised in this particular way they had been
captured by these processes which are not necessarily evil but they are kind of dead inside right and
since they're dead inside they don't want there to be things that are alive inside that's a threat to
their viability their authority there so this is part of the key to the medicine that perhaps we might be
able to produce together yeah exactly and um the idea that we can go to sleep at night and say to the system
show me how to heal what i need to heal is uh it's a query into the big cheese or this consciousness
that most people call god it is a query that will be answered we don't know how it's answered oftentimes
we might have dreams and we might not remember the dreams but we wake up and we feel different
and we go about our day in a different way or um i i i have an intention for a red sweater and i've been
having it and having it in my mind or something and i go to a store and i see this beautiful
um sweater draped on the back of a chair and someone just said oh that was just returned
you're interested in that and i'm like yeah let me smell it first no whatever it is but i'll feel it
i'll and and that was just the gift that was a simple oh you need you know you need a a vitamin but these
are the things that once we are aware that we can ask for it does come to us it's nothing um it's
nothing less than a a miracle in some way that we have this ongoing connection to source it's that we
hate having to hate having to grow up and those of us who are older than 50 happen to have a way of
understanding and because i've been working in consciousness for so long all of those people
the ones that are alive and people they are actually doing the best they can and it's not about
defending that you know even they know that they're not they're not doing the best they can that is
actually the best they can do and if we continue to find a way for us to do the very best we can do
maybe it's going to be inspiring for someone else i don't know everything i mean i'm not walking around
you know touting the fact that i know things the fact is i do have to know on some level but i'm not
going to go down the road of oh i knew that i knew that iceberg was there well it doesn't matter honey
you're dead yeah wasn't it wasn't it wasn't important that you knew it you couldn't do anything
about it and but while we're here and we always have the opportunity to do something about it i'm going
to wrap this up i choose love i choose love too
so when you say you're going to wrap this up are you saying we're out of time or are you saying
we're going to wrap that put a little ribbon on that topic kind of both
yeah yeah it's like i mean this is an ongoing conversation for me i mean i would love that
and you know and listening to your conversation with amber that's that's you know i i want to be
a part of an ongoing conversation yeah me too yeah this is what usually this is what usually
happens actually right we we have a conversation and then we're like when can we do another one
exactly well that's all i'm all in for that any time i will i will be there believe it yeah good
that's good because i think that that's the nature of it's look it's not that i have the answer i
literally was put into that family had those experiences handled those experiences the best i could
um got really curious about murder because i had three murders in my hometown which a very small
hometown between the age of 11 and 13 an accident with my horse where i was given a vision right
before i had the accident and told how to protect myself so i wouldn't die i mean and inspiring other
people to pay attention to the history of the trajectories of these sort of miraculous things
so that they know they're not alone so that they know that they can tap into the source so that they
know we are in this together in an experience when you spoke about uh the matrix um one of my favorite
authors who's a madman and i i'm fond of a variety of people who are you know unstable uh phil k dick he
wrote this book yes yes vast active living intelligence system and i just think it's important
for us as humans to understand that the humans aren't necessarily the intelligent thing around here
we're very thinky but there is a system in which we are embedded and from which we we arise and for
which we exist that's universal it's not merely human it's more than human we are more than human
and when you speak of your own experiences your gifts your skills your surprises in life the one of
the the um perspectives i would like others to receive from your story is a validation of the vastly
more than ordinary that is natural to us is your sound still working yeah i was just whispering i'm
like going yeah yeah yeah i would like them to have that validation okay one final question before
we wrap up what brings meaning to your life these days
the kindness that others have for each other for animals
it really boils down to the kindness
and the juxtaposition of that where we wake up on whether it's a christmas morning or kwanzaa
or you know during hanukkah or something whatever it is it is the inspiration of the information that's
in memory and we can love our deceased loved ones we can find the memories we can bring those memories to
life that encourages that spark to be felt in another dimension before that consciousness moves on and
reincarnates we still have that connection and when people find that out and they call me and they
said oh my god i just saw my grandma i'm like that's fabulous well i don't know about it and like well
how'd you how'd you feel i felt great well it's a surprise but it's it's the interesting
connections that people make every single day about love
love so thank you for this opportunity to reconnect with you and whomever is out here that we can have
a conversation with thank you you are so inspiring what a beautiful shining soul you are i i love you
you're amazing i'm so grateful to know you and to be a part of your world thank you so much marlon
you darren thank you i choose love to
