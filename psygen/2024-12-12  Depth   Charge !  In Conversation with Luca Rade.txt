so yeah you were talking about something really trippy that was very unexpected
which was your sense of is there a love field here which is not even the kind of thing i would
normally think about or necessarily like yeah just to say some more about your experience since you
got here around that if you're willing yeah um well i'm in it so it's i gotta like zoom out a
little bit to talk about it um yeah i mean the main contrast for me has been like talking to my
partner on the phone and texting and stuff versus being here and talking to people here and just
noticing that contrast and then also a friend of mine here that i met in ashville uh and then but
who lives here and noticing the difference in how we interacted there versus how we interacted here
so those are the two main like contrast signals oh and then going into nature and just being like
kind of shifting timelines into like my full beingness and then noticing the difference
from where i was before i did made that shift um
and and then also a lot of people have been like
like complimenting me on my like heart connection and how warm i am and stuff
and um and there's this like enlivening that happens as they're saying that of like you know feeling that
and it's like a sense of them not having that usually as much um and yeah it's just something something
like uh
there's like the field of love like that where i live is kind of primary not in the whole town or anything but at least in my community is like
the primary thing like the main thing we're first attuning to is like
love like our love of our friends and our partners and close ones and the love of ourselves and the world and stuff and then
everything else is like downstream from that like projects in the world and like
conflicts and uh you know plans of how to live life and all of that is like downstream from that
and i've kind of gotten used to that now and then coming back here it's like oh here's like flips like the primary
thing is that is like the project and like making a difference in the world and like how you're living life
and like the transactional aspects of relationships um like i'm getting something from you you're getting something from me
and then the love field is like a very often distant thing or for people that are really like
pushing it it's like they're trying to pull it up higher but it's not like at the primary like it can't
the field keeps it from being in the primary level because there's such a strong like alternative primary field
wow yeah yeah so i was eerie that i think just the body sensation is like i'm like
floating through mars yeah
which is it's a it's a kind of crazy feeling yeah it does it is a little bit like a spaceship here
um and i think there's something interesting about this which is i mean there's a bunch of interesting
things about it uh what am i doing here
just trying to make sure the screen doesn't go to dark while we're doing this
more weird technical things
hopefully it'll just stay going
um
so you know i've been here forever uh i've hardly ever left
um
the few times i've left the places that i went were very different but nothing like where you've been
um so it's hard for me to get a read on like how it might actually be in a place like what you're
talking about but there's a few things that i know that are weird about this and about here
um and one of you know these things are just sort of my speculations or perspectives right i'm not
trying to say this is how it is or anything like that what's true i don't know what's true i mean i just
know what i can sense and um there's this feature of modernity that's desperately trying to evict anything
that produces novelty including organisms or intelligence or anything
it just wants like dead space because there's these three features that orient human awareness very
strongly vigilance ambiguity and prediction
so ambiguity amplifies vigilance
right because the more there's novelty if you're threat sensitive in any way you've got to amplify
your vigilance
and this is for the sake of predictability right like so inside here it's dead space there's nothing
moving in here except the screens and us right so it's almost like when i was a kid
there was this projection of futurity i'm going to write down thoughts while you talk yeah that's
there's oh oh there's that's much better than a phone yeah um yeah so in when i was a kid i read a
lot of science fiction right and the whole idea was that technology would um save us from everything
we're going to have utopia no more war no more disease no more poverty um and then we had films for
example like 2001 a space odyssey and for anyone who's seen this film
you will notice that the inside of the spaceship is absolutely sterile there is nothing alive in there
right so this vision of space travel involved dead space inside spaceships but instead of getting that
what we got was this weird um evacuation right of our living spaces to more resembles what it would
be in in a spaceship right just dead clinical terrain which lowers the vigilance threshold dramatically
because it lowers ambiguity dramatically and you don't have to make you don't have to worry about
predictions much inside dead space there's another really trippy feature of the human
um sort of inclination to value predictions which is of course the basis of physics right physics is
all about predictions um how do i make this thing not go to sleep
is there a screen i'm an actual mac tech and i don't know how to make it not go to sleep energy
saver screen yeah i tried that okay lock screen maybe uh it's below there right there we go that's great
and maybe turn off the turn display off when inactive up there there's this one yeah that one and the one
below it yeah great so um you know the humans particularly technological humans are extremely focused on prediction
because all of our devices and our machines require uh skillful prediction to function properly
and it gives us um a perspective of being divorced from nature and standing over nature being able to
direct the forces of nature and so forth much like gods uh i think there were some biblical references
at the tower of babel like don't let these people get break them up into little groups because if they can
be coherent they're going to rip out the foundations of heaven which we could even imagine to be
what we think of as quantum physics but i'm not particularly inclined to travel in that direction though i
have some weird insights about it this morning there's a common um and i think regrettable uh predilection to
um re re re-image relationships metaphysics and so forth uh in in quantum in quantum mechanical terms
and i think that's regrettable for a lot of reasons um yeah whatever's going on with quantum mechanics we're
in the very early days of it yeah like preschool yeah um we don't understand it and and i think
we're pre-copernican revolution like we're trying to force everything into these complex equations
that work kind of you know like they match the data but they don't make any intuitive sense and
they're really forced and complex which is exactly what it was like before the copernican revolution
when everyone was trying to like force the model where the earth is at the center to work and they
succeeded equations made sense but they didn't make any intuitive sense and they were too complexed
to me it has that same imprint it does and a denial from speaking to people who study physics like
there's actually a lot of like suppression of alternative frames on quantum mechanics there is
which is shocking in a way and maybe not shocking in the end but it's sort of typical i mean how old is
science 200 years or something right as we practice it today it's really really young yeah um and there
tends to be these long narrative these narratological frames that become prevalent and embedded which
is both natural and unfortunate uh what i was trying to get at though is
so i'm just going to really quickly mention the weird insight i had this morning because i think about
physics problems all the time i listen to physicists very regularly for many hours
um and i've always been curious about the questions that underlie physics what is light what is time
what is matter what is energy what is birth what is death all these things although the last two don't
usually get dressed by physics and um what i'm fairly sure is happening that the humans don't are
incapable of forging a system to understand is that a particle is exploring all possible transitions over the
the entirety of time outside of time and it's selecting a path and weirdly this is so i've been okay i need
to be careful not to bird walk here but i've been examining the concept of justice in ancient greek metaphysics
because recently i'm i've met i've become injured i've come i've become i've been introduced to some
very unusually minded greek people who studied like the ancient eleusinian mysteries or as she would
pronounce it eleusina and then there's also this madman named bomb and hillman who's read a bunch of
the ancient greek medical texts and there's this fundamental idea of justice but it's not the kind
that we practice and i think that what's going on the reason that we see the effects in the double
slit experiment that we see is that the particle is splitting into all possible configuration or all
possible transit configurations testing them and then selecting a primary route afterwards it's it's
not the shortest route between all points it's the best of all possible routes given the entirety of
time which is a thing that i think is expanding right so i don't think there was necessarily a beginning
and a ending but there is a sort of sphere that collapses and expands and it's bigger the next time
that was a long digression what i actually wanted to say was that when humans become fascinated by prediction
they will probably ignore the fact that you more the more you kill what you're predicting the better your
predictions look so if you become like um arrogant like my predictions are great i killed everything
off they're perfect every time right the more dead terrain you've got the better you're the more like
a god you seem right it's really this is sort of the also the idea of the laboratory right like make a
box that nothing can affect and then look at just one thing inside that box which is the weirdest
possible approach to try and understand nature what are your thoughts yeah i have so many thoughts
i'm ready uh-huh oh my gosh where do i start um
yeah on the the on the prediction thread uh
okay no let me let me start from the beginning of wherever you like my list and then go from there
uh yeah so with the first with the ambiguity the list of uh you know ambiguity predictability and
what was the first vigilance vigilance um i guess i would have a slight i don't think it's a disagreement
but an addition which is that in this spaceship those things are have not been suppressed like
spaces are not dead i mean they are dead but they're they channel that in a very specific way
so people are very vigilant and are there is a lot of ambiguity um and they're like there is a strong
like drive towards better prediction but not towards life but towards like the perpetuation of this like
modernist machine because sf is this like hub of innovation and has created a lot of the deadening
structures because there's this like really weird warped way that all that's that those like primal
forces have been channeled towards like uh like almost like within the spaceship ambiguity has been
created in like a controlled environment so that all this like vigilance and predictive energy
is not it's no longer like the the meta environment is dead so nobody has any tracking of vigilance
of like nature or of like energetic flows or you know so all of that is like totally controlled and
deadened and then within that there's this like artificial microcosm that's been created almost
like an artificial womb is the image that's coming to me where we're all just floating in this like
artificial womb and in there there's like the creation of ambiguity such that people
re-channel their vigilance and their predictive drive from like reality basically towards this like
constrained distorted channel that then creates more of the deadness there's nothing we disagree
about there yeah what what i i just want to say back to you something about what i think you may have
been pointing at which is like all right um what we're doing here creates certain forms of ambiguity
it doesn't like here yeah here here in san francisco gotcha gotcha right yeah and in on in sort of
silicon valley west coast this whole thing um so we exchange the ambiguity that we might get in a natural
setting right for a sort of highly curated technological uh and conceptual ambiguity instead right we'll
take this instead or or this is being foisted on us primarily i mean yeah i think it's you know i don't
necessarily have a strong opinion about i'll be right back about whether or not um
uh probably do actually i'm not thinking about it so personally i cannot imagine that
ambient electromagnetic fields have no effect on our cells or bodies it's impossible for me to understand
how that could be true um everything that the cell membrane does is mediated by electromagnetism
so i imagine you and me for example trying to have a conversation say in a parking garage filled with
revving semi trucks and how would that go how could you know what we have to do write things on pages
and then show them to each other because our voices would not be hearable we wouldn't even be able to
hear i mean we just be devastated by the noise field so um i don't know you know how aware of it you are but
if you looked at my wi-fi like uh if i turn on my wi-fi on my on my computer right you would see
i don't know wild guess 70 networks right doubt that's the same where you live yeah
um and that's just wi-fi right what about the wires the you know all of the things well and the
human field too i don't know if that's mediated by electromagnetism like i don't know the mechanism of it
but i just know that there is something you know like it's in the air is like an expression
and i've really been feeling that being here like what i was telling you about this eerie like field
of love being repressed kind of thing like that does feel like a very tangible force on me and
maybe it's just mediated through like my brain and there's no actual like physical waves happening
but i think probably there are but anyway i don't know about the mechanism but it is a real
thing for sure that has a huge huge like shared effect um and then yeah i the juicy thing that's
been coming up for me is how all of this would manifest or does manifest in the field of love
when that's primary um so with prediction in particular like there's a if the field of love
is primary then you have like loved ones that you're like connected to like unconditioned i mean
not completely unconditionally you know like if you killed their mother or something like maybe that
it would break you know but like almost like almost unconditionally like anything you could do within
the range of like what you would just naturally do is contained within that container and that actually
creates massive predictability and replaces the need for predictability in the external world or in
in all these other forms that everyone is constantly seeking predictability and also it removes
ambiguity a certain flavor of ambiguity because you're like i know i can rely on these people and
i know i'm loved and i know i can love someone like kind of in perpetuity in a sense and then so then
that ambiguity is on and then all the other need to reduce ambiguity and to increase predictability that
i see here everyone is just like so obsessed with all that just falls away and you can exist in the chaos of
the world and you're i mean not there's still a desire to bring order to it and that is aligned with
your values and it's not like you just like at least for me it's not like i withdraw from the world
but i do stop like compulsively and anxiously seeking predictability and the removal of ambiguity
and my vigilance then can soften and it softens out of this artificial womb
um because it's like that the the womb can't grip me because it grips me by deadening my field of love
so my field of love is alive the womb is just a dead thing sitting in front of me and i'm like
fuck this womb thing like you know i want to be in the real womb of the universe and then there all
like everything elevates to that level of like the metadynamics and the actual reality of the world
and then there and then there's just a there's like a foundation in the field of love that makes it so
much smoother to navigate all that without this like compulsive like survival instinct thing that's
driving that's that's driving it into the artificial womb otherwise yeah flight fright freeze fawn right
flight fight freeze fawn right yeah and of course here what we fawn over is deeply weird and non-human
not not human i don't mean not human i mean not human yeah okay so there's a bunch of things that
occurred to me while you're saying that first of all i love the presentation of our existence as though
the earth is a womb our body is a womb our relationships are wombs nature is a womb and then the
humans keep making this artificial thing right they're trying to evict all that stuff right and
then put this other thing in its place and it almost feels that like when you're when i've been in a
state of not being connected to all those wombs and i'm on my phone it almost feels like this desire
to be like held in this womb and like ah like you know the safety of whatever the i'm scrolling through
i mean not even the specific things but just the sense of being part of this artificial womb that has
like order instruction oh my god so yeah yeah there's so much there um okay so
yes yes yes yes all right so i don't have i'm not using the notebook so i have to like thread
i gotta sort threads yeah do you want a page from this or no i'm okay for the moment we'll see how my
anciently decrepit memory holds up over this course of the conversation um all right so imagine people
who live you probably don't have to imagine you've probably experienced it people who live intimately
communally and what happens in that situation is that the vigilance burden gets shared
uh right now you have this instead of this right right yeah and and so the vigilance burden gets
naturally shared the dealing with ambiguity gets naturally shared these people are actually are
literally dreaming for and with and for each other when they're asleep right they're doing yeah things
that these people are not doing right they're not it's not that they wouldn't it's that the context
right not only doesn't support it it miss uh directs it right right it almost like it's even
worse than not supporting it it supports it but in the totally wrong direction right so like if if if
we suppose for example that dreaming has oracular qualities which i definitely suppose um what we
would find in the populations here is that they're going to be predicting things like something that happens
in the television show tomorrow night right whereas in a communal situation they're going to be
predicting things about oh there's a transformation of energy that needs to be dealt with communally or
uh there's a food you know there's a transformation in food availability and or abundance or you know
they're going to be networked in a sort of mini cognition right to use my little coin term in such a way that
what they're sensing what they're using vigilance for the ambiguities they're dealing with and the
predictions that they make are integral and what we could call organic right organic to their relationships
and to the living place in which they're in since we're in a dead place and we don't have anything like
this we don't have organic multi-sensing we don't share the vigilance burdens we're making predictions about
representational nonsense and garbage and stuff that has it has an effect on our lives here
but it's meaningless in the terms of what would be valuable to an actual living room right
so these are things that i notice in relation to some of what you were just sharing it's super
important to understand i think and to remain aware of the fact that the lie of individuality is a malignant
lie it's fundamentally untrue um it is true that if you look at the hand from this perspective
right then what you see are what looks like individuals but if you just do this you realize
like there's no chance of this being i really love that actually yeah it's a beautiful metaphor yeah
this is one of the things that angel gave me a long time ago it was like tell them about their
choose the hand every time you teach them something shove them the hand they'll get it right they'll get it
that way um because this is actually fundamental to everything about our cognition it's how we
relate with physical objects um all these things so yeah from this perspective the appearance of
individuality is quite compelling but if you just do this you realize there's no possibility of that
being true and the culture in the united states if we could call it that which i'd be
i don't think what we have as a culture i think we have some kind of weird um multi-spawning array of
anti-cultures um yeah but if we call it a culture then uh it's focus on the primacy of the individual
the accountability of the individual all these things demand high levels of vigilance terror of
ambiguity um selfishness greed uh anxiety right because how could you be a lone finger on like
what's so what our culture does is it replaces this thing with a bunch of representations and lies and
fucking garbage right danger it just replaces it with danger and there's there's a feature of human
cognition at the broad scale i think and i know you're aware of this though you may think about it
in a way unique from how i do that it's like a broken protector part in ifs
and it's trying to take care of every possible job and it feels really vulnerable and like it'll get
evicted if anybody figures out what it's doing and it'll get punished and all kinds of bad accounting
things will happen and this feature despises the existence of organisms it despises anything
intelligent doesn't want intelligence wants ignorance the program the protector part the broken protector
part that is sort of runs of this country right and our society if we could i think it's the wrong word for
it but um it is absolutely focused on one thing which is preserving its absolute sovereignty over
all phenomena and it will gladly put and advancing preserving and advancing yes exactly it'll put it
doesn't care about it's not trying to survive it's trying to remain dominant it doesn't it'll gladly
sacrifice itself to maintain that dominance it'll sacrifice anything it's like a an absolute imperative
that a it not be outed right not be noticed or seen right b nothing challenges it this is why it hates
intelligence it doesn't want anything resembling any kind of authority over meaning value identity
other than its own yeah and it resembles you know amy gilchrist talks about this but it's something i've
learned in studying neuroscience and i'll stop lathering here for in a moment um it resembles a person who's
had a stroke on the right hemisphere which would normally rebalance fictions that the left hemisphere
is promoting in this kind of situation uh which is clinically referred to as annosynosia or body
forgetting um there's a there's an actual little incident in ramachandran's writing where he discusses
a neurologist coming to someone who's had a stroke on the right hemisphere and is in this condition
he says for example mr jones are you where you have a stroke mr jones no i haven't
and he says well mr jones you know can you move your right off your left arm of course i can
you know okay go ahead and move your move your left arm mr jones there i did arm hasn't moved um and so
the neurologist will hold up mr jones left arm in front of his face between his hands
and say mr jones this is your left hand can you wiggle your fingers and mr jones will say that's not
mine it's yours really and the neurologist will say for example surely mr jones you realize that humans
don't have three hands and mr jones will say yes but as you have three elbows it follows that you have
three hands right and this kind of thing now a long time ago in some maybe the late 1800s an italian
neuroscientist discovered that under certain conditions under this condition of annosynosia
i think it's the right ear canal if you turn someone's head on their side and you drip cold water
into the right ear canal it somehow briefly reconnects the hemispheres
and you can then have the same conversation with them and in this case the one that i'm citing here
the person began crying and said i'm so sorry i of course i know i know i just don't know why i was
lying to you i feel terrible right this kind of thing and so it's almost as if in one of mcgill chris
arguments which i love i'm so glad he wrote the master in his emissary because i was aware of these
things long before his book um one of uh one of his proposals is that modernity our societies they are
like this feature of the left hemisphere they don't they're uncorrectable they just want to dominate
and verbal fit anything that can be said is true right the fact obviously it is true that something has
been said right if i say these words it's true that i've said these words and so this aspect seems to
conflate that truth with validity and you can see this in for example the um illocutions of people
certain political figures let's say i'll be too specific right so anything i say it's true i said it
it's a fact and also in the sort of opinionaires that the culture breeds right they don't want
there's no acknowledgement of external authority expertise not none there are cohorts in which the
acknowledgement of external authority or expertise is highly inhibited inhibited yeah i would extend that and say
like i think there are a lot of flows within modernity that are very like expert authority focused
and that do kind of uh slice what is said in terms of whether it's true based on an external authority
like science or whatever but there's some quality of it that is uh
the sense that kind of truth can be like 100 represented in language and it's like accessible
to us as humans like 100 accessible to us so it's i guess it's a slight modification of what you said to
to extend it beyond just like anything that can be said is true to like anything that is true can be said
so i guess i would flip oh yeah yeah i like i like that that's really interesting which is not true
you know like impossible in fact it's almost the opposite like nothing that is said is true it's
only points it can point towards truth and the pointing you can discern in the pointing so it's not
like there's just total like chaos but it never actually touches anything yeah true because the truth
like it's it's a you know it's a verbal thought thing that is separate from the actual phenomenon i often
just that um the moment i begin making face noises i am lying right because that's a good way to put it
like and people will say well that's not really right and i'm like well it's more right than a lot of
things right yeah i mean language is such a trippy i am absolutely fascinated by the predicament of
of in language to humans what a what a bizarre like 19 kinds of science fiction situation right
william s burroughs didn't go far enough when he said language is a virus from outer space like he was
you know he was goofing around with play-doh at that point it is the weirdest thing about our people
and so powerful too like if it's in the right context of acknowledging that it only points to truth and
it never is true like the the holding container of it is the entire determinant of whether it's like
a virus that's eating us up and disconnecting us from our kind of base intrinsic divine reality versus
like encouraging and like empowering that and turning into like a kind of a full god being collective
like it's a very connected it can be very connected force and a very like collectively pointing towards
the truth force and it can be the total opposite yeah it's it's the weirdest technology ever yeah it's
probably the first technology in a way although i can imagine some people say no we were making
tools before we were speaking but how the would they know that um and one of the things i notice
about when i when i have the privilege of learning a bit about indigenous cultures and their languages
so particularly with my friend ryan first diver who teaches me some stuff about blackfoot
language and traditional ways of life they have built-in protections against the stuff that is eating us
alive for example they will not let nomenclature pervade over the relational situation so for example if you see someone
there's a complex set of verbal transformations that would occur if you were up on a hill and you saw
something moving in the distance and as you approached you realized oh this is someone on horseback
perhaps oh this is perhaps a male on horseback oh this is perhaps joe who i know right but none of those things
would prevail would pervade over what happens when you actually come together because we don't know
for example if it's actually joe even though it looks like joe and we don't know who joe comes from
right who is joe sort of representing all these features are open and they're and i'm probably
misstating this to some degree but i remember actually the word for something far away which is
i think my topi and then ah mama topi and then it means like one is coming uh but we see what one not who
right there is a being right the fact that it looks like this and that is interesting yeah but it doesn't
and the words don't pervade over the relational situation right and they have like stories about
why this is crucial so that for example you're very careful not to think that because
because because i might be inclined to call that person an enemy that they are an enemy
right this is not how we do it right yeah right like we just like that person's an enemy
they're an enemy you know generally speaking yeah that i feel like i've this is a big thing that i've
been um exploring in quote-unquote polyamory but polyamory itself is also a label of this sort so
that's just the closest approximator to what i'm pointing at but it's actually what i'm describing
is very different from what is described by the label polyamory follow i follow yeah um but the the
kind of core essence that the word polyamory is pointing towards is where you remove the like
labels being primary like this person is my spouse this person is my girlfriend this person is my
friend this person is my lover this person is my brother my sister my parent whatever and that there's
that same thing that happens there like that is it closes what that being is they are this specific
label in relation to this other person in relation to me and then you get a one dimension like each
of those has like a one-dimensional list of characteristics that you know is determined by
whatever culture you're in or like the norms of your family or something like that and you're mainly
adhering to that list and how you're relating to that person so you're represent relating to their
representation which is closed and doesn't have a space for for being so it's dead you're relating
to them as a dead thing by the way ambiguity like you can write exactly right the culture of ambiguity
the closure evicts ambiguity exactly and there's another important reason okay please continue yeah
yeah and so then there's that and then when you're instead in the field of love with that person
which doesn't happen instantly or i mean actually i guess there is a way that if you're both
in that you can like already come to that immediately without labels from the very beginning and
explore it from the beginning that way um where like you're in each moment relating to that person
as their full being and you're you are determining like for example with my partner we do have like a lot
of norms and rules is maybe too strong of a word but we do have like agreements between each other
but they're very specifically tracked onto our dynamic and they change you know like sometimes
week to week they change but not arbitrary like oh i'm just gonna do something else like we talk about
it but there's this like a live fluidity to it which only works because we're both totally not in
that representational way of relating and we're purely in being and like attuning to each other really
deeply and also like there's a deep respect for each other as beings that we're sharing a life with
and so it actually works really really really well to do that it feels a lot safer and less ambiguous
than if we had a set label that had a set of requirements because then you always have this
doubt like and i was talking to someone yesterday about this even who was more on the monogamous side
and they were like if i was not monogamous i would always have this doubt that the person is going to
choose someone else over me or is going to like betray me in some way and so i need the closed
representational container to feel safe and to remove the ambiguity but it actually increases that
because then you always have that doubt whereas if you're attuned in this way then you you like
feeling the other person always in resonance with whatever the agreements are in that and you trust that
if it's changing they're going to like shift they're going to communicate about it and you're going to
shift it together in collaboration and so then you're grounded in the field of love and then
there's way less ambiguity the ambiguity disappears basically because you're in that
relational field that's non-verbal uh and non-representational and there's no label like
you know i call her my partner for like ease so because people have like know what that means
right yeah but to our each other we're like we don't we're nothing we're we're nothing and everything
we're just what we are we're not a word we're not a word exactly and that doesn't mean we're
not committed right it's the opposite we're so committed that we don't have a word we're so
committed that we don't have to discuss our commitment exactly yeah yeah like by the time
you have to represent right by the time you have to represent it in language you're already departing
from it right this is one of the problems yeah and you can but you still language is still very
helpful to point towards what yes what it is as long as we do use language a lot but it's very different
flavor of using language from like this is the closed representational format we're slotting
ourselves in that's so brilliant um and this uh coincides with another thing that's recently i've
become aware of it um and i'm so excited about this uh by the way if you'd like more tea we've
there's more tea there's more water just cool no thanks i still got some but yeah we can take a
break in like yeah 15 minutes great i also have i want to hear this and i also there's all this
a whole backlog of get to it yeah okay so this is this is crazy um i have a friend who's an acting
teacher and when i was thinking about vigilance ambiguity and prediction which first started
in a in a family crisis in which i was able to notice this in the behavior of two of the people who
were involved um so my father died and me my sister and my son were in his house together and it just
went crazy but mainly between my sister and my son but i had to sort of hold the space and that was rough
in any case um all right
so there's there are these features here that i want to highlight first and and one of them is
what what i'm going to call the organic womb that you've been describing with your relationship with
your partner which is foundationally relational and not linguistic or conceptual or framed and then
the artificial womb which is highly framed and depends on language and frameworks and rules and
agreements that are very basically explicit or tend towards being explicit uh and also how that you
know technology and all those other things that are in there okay here's the crazy thing
humans know how to enact familiar roles and so they will select a familiar role even if it deprives
them of all kinds of things because they know how it works so if i play the role of victim i know how
that works i know what i get i know how to play the role i know what'll happen it reduces a certain
kind of ambiguity right yeah and it creates it creates a sort of certainty of various predictables
as well yeah if i play the judge role i know how that works so i play the parent role i know how
that works the lover role you know the villain role the rescuer role um the inventor role i know how
all those things work so i'm inclined to select one of i may be inclined to select one of those roles
instead of something that i don't know how it works which is improvisation right it's the spirit of
living in
in play experiment discovery learning wonder trust um love right all of these things so we don't know how
that works there's no set array of you can't tell if you're going to get rewarded or not you can't
tell if you're going to lose things or not but those two things like am i going to get rewarded or am i
going to lose something right are no longer the motivating um purposive origins of our thought
behavior feelings but over on the side where familiar roles work am i going to get rewarded or punished yeah
right is the primary motivating purpose of underlying thing yeah and so this is what's mostly going on
is that artificial womb thing of how i've frame initially framed vigilance ambiguity prediction
it's absolutely brilliant what you've done here where you're like well imagine a different womb
in which those features are still there but they function for purposes that we could probably mostly
trust and are mutualizing and take care of each other and our place together and our ancestors and
our progeny right like the whole it's just over the whole sphere there's this sort of shining light
of true mutuality i think even that's the wrong word something like communion yeah right for sure
i just mentioned one more thing and then i'll shut up it recently occurred to me that minds are not for
thinking they are for communion they're for becoming together right and thinking is what we do
when that's not happening right that's the symptom of isolation right and it's really attractive to
me because i'm an intellectual whatever you know so i totally i can lean into that really heavily yeah
minds are not for thinking they are for making this this what i would call the third mind which is what
arises when we come together joyfully lovingly yeah with awareness and hope and um a recollection of the
urgencies that accompanied us into human birth totally beautiful that was beautifully put yeah
totally resonate with all that and that last thing was really powerful i mean all of that was super
powerful and then i just got like hit like our minds are not for thinking but for communion um but
that's the reason that western society is so much better at technology because culture is where the
mind is being used for communion they're just not using it as much to develop advanced technology so
brilliant what you said they're absolutely important um and i'll come back to that as yeah
after we wander in your boat yeah which is but i think the key the the beautiful beautiful thing
about this current moment is that in western civilization we have a chance to return to communion
using our minds for communion and still have this ability to keep developing technology like it's a unique
it's the same way where like you know with the theory of communism like first you have to go through
capitalism to get to communism like you can't just start with communism i'm not a communist or anything
but that same please don't call me names later but that same theory of changes i think applies to this
where a lot of spiritual narratives that i hear around is like we have to return to some previous
state and like western civilization sucks we got to like just basically totally get rid of it and return
to like a more like indigenous way of being something like that you know there's very many
variations on that narrative sure i think that's really wrong not wrong but like not the right
approach it's not gonna happen it's not gonna happen first of all and two not only is it not gonna
happen and damn it's not gonna happen it's actually we have a much better path forward which is to
into like we're to keep the fact keep what we are not just like burn ourselves to the ground like keep what we
are and then return to from where we are using the mind as communion being in the field of love being
in that the organic womb being in this like communal communion shared vigilance setting bring all that
into where we currently are without burning it all down yeah and then we get both like we get both that
and then we get for sure it's going to transform in some kind of way but we can still have all this
like technological advancement and all the like the the the deep dedication to truth like discovering
truth even if it's unpleasant and all these other things that are like strengths i would say of western
civilization and are currently like just kind of shooting off in terrible ways but the potential for
they're they're like neutral in a way that that force is neutral and depending on the holding container
that force could be directed towards something that's like enhancing of communion and of divinity and of the
field of love this is something we don't have to get rid of it yeah and i think there's a fear that
i also used to have and that i think so many people share is like if we just go back to like
the field of love or whatever we're just going to get like wiped out by china or something you know
which is a little like you know i think there's there's validity to where that fear is coming from
and that you know the whichever civilization is the strongest you know conquers other civilizations like
historically that keeps happening over and over so i think that is a truth kind of an unpleasant truth
and ideally we're all just floating in the field of love and eventually hopefully we all will be but
intermediately where we're at like we do have to account for the fact that this we do need like
civilizational strength and technological strength no matter what we do um i apologize for just
deconstructing no it's all good it's all good yeah i'm with you um but it's not it's not mutually exclusive
which is it was a huge insight for me to realize and the reason i know that is because i'm i'm in
that now i'm in that field of love and it's it has not at all reduced my desire to be in that like sharp
technological mindset towards creating things it's just totally shifted how i'm in it and what it's
pointed towards but it's not like that just dissolved um and it's yeah it's like also in terms of like
being really productive and stuff there's definitely a flavor of sacrificial productivity that is gone
for me now but the core of being very productive and sharp is still there and its motivation now is
not like you know needing prediction and vigilant it's not coming from this like anxiety it's coming
from like being in the field of love and wanting to deepen it and advance it and so that's it but it's
still there basically is the big thing um and then also on the the role selection thing um
yeah that's the feeling i think if you're in the field of love you don't need to select a role
because you're in the safety of the womb and the the the ambiguity of the relational container is low
i mean there might be a lot of ambiguity in terms of like oh now we have a conflict and you know am i
going to partner with this person or no so there's still that ambiguity but the basic like i'm held
in a community ambiguity is gone and so then you don't need to select a role that is closed and
causes all the sacrificial thing but when you remove that and this is i think the big thing
that san francisco and much of the western world does is it like pulls the carpet out from under you
so that like if you don't select a role you're like completely or the sensation is you
would be completely and like you you wouldn't be getting your like very basic needs met
and so then the only possible there's like a terror to it and which starts when you're a baby
you know like letting babies cry or like smothering them or just not nurturing them and it's no one's
fault it's just nobody knows how to parent really in a way that creates that like soft nurturing communal
container because we just don't have it um so then you would get that inbuilt terror that forces constant
role selection and then when you're when you're forced to select a role then you can be manipulated into
to slotting into a limiting role in which you're perpetuating this modernity force that's killing
everything not because you want to and right most people i think have no idea that they're doing that
because the role is designed in a way that it feels like it's very life nourishing i think for everyone
there's a feeling in the belly if you're really attuned to it like what am i doing right yeah but for
most people that's repressed and the shared culture is to not listen to that and so and on the surface
there's so many nice narratives saving the world like love beauty the best product ever
yeah exactly so there's and that's all part of the role and so the role if you can close your belly
feeling it feels pretty good relative to the terror of just being in this floating like unheld
situation uh and then the last thing i'll say i mean there's not the last thing i'll say at all but
the last thing i'll say before i hear what what i feel is you just clearly want to say a lot of things
right now um the yeah with the broken protector part oh and everything you've been talking about
like there's a lot of different it's a very not common is the wrong word but a lot of really smart
perceptive like deeply grounded in being people have identified that with different language which is i
think really helpful to mention it's the same way we're like you know for example like the dalai
lama said once like someone asked him like how should we become better buddhists as americans
and he was like don't become better buddhists use buddhism to become better christians
and the idea there is like all religions are kind of pointing towards the same enlightenment state just
with different frames and just use the one that works and realize they're all pointing towards the
same thing but it's you don't have to be like killing the other people or finding the right one or
something like they're all right in their own way depending and also all wrong in their own way you
know like they all have failure modes etc but anyways it's all the same thing is that there's a lot of
different frames pointing towards the same like phenomenon of this like broken protector part force
of modernity that's killing everything and deadening everything and to name a few one is um dominator
culture from non-violent communication which was marshall rosenberg who identified that i mean that's
exactly the thing that it's the same thing that i was pointing out when i talked about hates
intelligence doesn't want there to be organisms can't stand any sort of ambiguity yeah once absolute
dominion over the nature of all phenomenon yeah we could go on the list is like infinite it just
keeps going yeah and that that is dominator culture that term from nbc is pointing towards that thing
as well and then also like moloch you know that i do both in the more like technical sense
it's what what uh wek wetico wetico i've heard that oh yeah but i'm sure it's also i think that's
pre-moloch but yeah wetico is just sort of the it's a similar thing yeah and especially the poem howl
by by alan ginsburg i feel like really nails the sensation of it and then also heidegger talks about
this a lot and in particular that part of it is the uh abandonment by being and the self-concealment
of being of its own abandonment which is a huge part of it like what you were saying it doesn't
want to be seen no no yeah and it's it's really does not want to be seen no no any it's really strong
and and basically every frame that supposedly sees it is actually just concealing it yeah those frames get
captured by exactly exactly the frames that it's very active in capturing any frame that could
reveal it exactly and so then people feel like they're seeing it like i feel like wokeism is like
the maybe the most current prominent example but there's like hundreds today and historically
christianity too what it became not the original spirit of jesus but christianity post jesus and a
thousand other frames which you're like you feel like you're seeing it but actually it is directing your
eyes exactly to distract you from actually seeing it it's so like it's impossible to overstate how
powerful that and subtle that force is and i myself and i'm sure for you too like constantly we have to
like re-see how we're not seeing yeah yeah this is um the difference this is like why
a fundamental agreement that i'll make with someone with whom i presume that i will have political
religious or ideological conflict is could we just have the agreement that when we're together we
will try to see better together every time no matter what we're doing could we just have this
agreement and it's really helpful because if there's an actual bond forming and we make this agreement
it's very powerful otherwise what happens is people sort of just promote their pet biases
right generally yeah some people i should say yeah please continue yeah um so that was a big one
and then oh yeah this is a big juicy one okay now they're all juicy but yeah like packing a meal
yeah or like you know christmas dinner or something right yeah this is the turkey yeah right uh
uh yeah what you said really struck me about when you're in the community you don't have vigil the
vigilance is is shared and that's a huge and this individualism is when you remove this palm and you
everyone is just in this individualist thing then you your vigilance has to go to like a thousand percent
because you have to be vigilant of your entire relational landscape and you don't have any input from
other sensors you're a single sensor right and you have to you can't trust you can't you don't have a
shared trusting sensory system which is so stressful i mean no wonder everyone is like depressed and
anxious i mean no human is capable of that honestly and that i think that's why everyone is there's
such an energy that i'm always and here is it's so so strong but everywhere of like i'm not quite
good enough and i'm trying really hard but it's not quite working and like what's the right solution
and then that can get hijacked and you have a billion people selling you all kinds of things that
are going to like provide the answer to being in this literally impossible state of being an
individual organism that has to like track your entire reality yourself it's like just not possible
that was one of the things on my list on your list yeah the thing you just mentioned that's on my list
oh nice cool yeah and and then if you if and then with the vigilance that's such a beautiful thing
like instead of like i'm here and i'm like vigilant i'm vigilant i'm vigilant if you have a shared
context the field of love if you have that and not just in this like woo woo kind of oh the field
of love also in that energetic sense but also concretely like we're translating that into like
we're actually in something together like we're sharing yeah something you know right whether we're
living together we build the house together we clean the house together we have we like assign roles that
are like related to what needs to happen and so i don't just mean like we're just feeling it but
we're still living in our homes you know separate 30 minute drive apart and whatever you know
um and i mean it can still work with that context to some extent it's so it's kind of more nuanced but
um but yeah when you have that then there's the spaciousness for all that internally driven vigilance
to shift externally and then you have this communal vigilance and then it becomes actually quite easy
to recognize this like beast of modernity that's trying to constantly hide itself
because you're not wasting all your energy on the vigilance of your relational dynamics
and that's also why individualism is such a one of the reasons it's such a huge thing
in that system is because that prevents your vigilance from being directed towards
yeah keeping yourself and your loved ones safe from all the hydrating forces that are out there of
modernity but also of like spirits and of you know it's all kinds of things um and there's also
lots of good things out there i don't want to be in this paranoid frame like everything is bad
um but not everything is good for sure in terms of what it wants to do and the good stuff isn't
particularly militant whereas the bad stuff tends to be right so it's like exactly so you need that
discernment and also the yeah the discernment gets massively amped up if it's communal and you're like
syncing up it does there's a very real feeling of like when you sync up with someone in the vigilance
and discernment it gets like really amplified in a very non-linear way like it's i don't even know
how to put it into words no we agree there's just you're almost it's there's no efforting involved
with the conscious or there is but very little efforting involved with the conscious mind
like with my partner for example but also with my friend network there's like
just like in the course of how we relate unconsciously there's constant shared vigilance
of forces around us but also opportunities and opportunities but not with the like i feel like
the word vigilance is almost associated with strain because the way that we have to do it because
we're in this isolated bubble is so like strained but it's actually a very soft feeling when it's in
a relational field and share it and just showing up unconsciously yeah in the field that's an important
point yeah that's an important point um communal vigilance is sort of round edged and the other stuff is
sharp yeah exactly pointy yeah yeah and then uh yeah and then the the with the shaman i was thinking
as well like so uh i did this so i'm gonna i have a qigong uh school that i've been part of for four
years that's in russia and that's the only school outside of china that's part of the chinese taoist
association so they're closely tied to that lineage and there was a lecture once on like mentors like
what makes a good mentor what makes a good student how do you identify good mentors and he said this
thing that blew my mind and then made total sense he was like okay what does it mean to be a good
student he said it means you completely take care of all of your master's needs 100 which is most
importantly taking care of their heart by being a student that fully lives the teachings because the
master wants the student to imbibe the teachings so if you're living those fully in your life that's
taking care of their heart and then also relationally taking care of their heart but then also like
getting spring water from the top of the mountain for them hunting their meats and making sure it's
good quality building their shelter like all these pieces like totally taken care of and then the
master's teachings automatically transfer to you like fully and with like effortless yeah basically that's
hilariously brilliant because um it puts the oh it puts the emphasis on
true relational intimacy essentially there's a way of translating that into you create an absolutely
healthy authentic wound for them you make that womb exactly now they don't have to worry about the womb
exactly now everything comes to you right exactly like they're now they're in your womb yeah and
they're just going to naturally like osmosis out into your womb and you're going to become their
wisdom almost or not almost you are going to become their wisdom yeah which is such a different frame
from like the way we relate exactly yeah i teach here is technical object i give you technical object of
knowledge you practice this exactly get it right which there's also information in that but it's like
0.01 the depth of this form and that that makes me think and also what you were saying about this
externalizing the vigilance is like the shaman in a in a village society that's well held is totally
taken care of you know that is a specific because today if you're in a shamanic world like a healer role
you have to take care of your finances you know you got to make money you got to find your clients you
got to like you got to still be in this like and you still you have to manage your relational
exactly nobody is taking care of you as a healer that should not have to take care of themselves
because you're you see like even saying that i'm like oh that's a weird thing to say but it's not a
weird thing to say like the healer should not be of a society should not be taking care of themselves
yeah they should be taken care of so that they can like fully open into the vast task of being a healer
right and that's a huge thing what i'm trying to do with flourish which is the
you know quote unquote startup but truly more like a movement or like creating a village
flow or like activating the field of love more in a tangible way is ultimately i mean it's really
hard to do that in the context of the current world but is to to provide that container that womb
for practitioners for healers for shamans so that they so that there's a phrase waiting to come out
so that they can like fully soften into being like a healing creature you know because there's this
if they're in that vigilance they have to put on this like shell and then they're healing people
like from this shell and they can maybe you know if they're really good they can take off that shell
for the most part when they're in the session you know for a minute and then they got to close it again
and like they're at like one percent capacity yeah like and the good ones you know if you
like 12 capacity right exactly maybe had a discussion like this previously maybe i'm having a moment of
vague deja vu not important um yeah so and it's such a like unintuitive thing to do in the context of
society today to it's like non-transactional to be just to have that commitment to like fully taking care
it's like too much like you know what kind of organization fully takes care of someone so that
they can like fully be in their role and not have to worry about like life uh but that's that's like
i think the key piece that is required to shift more towards this like global not i don't want to say
global village that's such a corny term but this field of love like village relational field
um and then i think people are gonna the feeling you would get if you were being taken care of
by someone who is fully taken care of and who is very good at taking care of others
like the feeling versus like right now you right you pay some money here you're my healer here's
some money give me a session okay you're at 10 capacity and still for the good ones it's like
probably three percent receptivity too right it doesn't work on both ends exactly
because you're also transactionally receiving that instead of just receiving it because you need
it or because you yeah because you know it's so different because what you know about the nature
of existence transforms if it is given to you right right this changes what the world is which changes
what all other things are right it's the hall of four exactly exactly exactly totally well said yeah
it's no longer like i'm in this system and this is a specific transaction in this system that is
amplifying me in my very limited constrained like placement in the system this is like a that just
like breaks open the shell of that system and now you're in a whole new world that's transcends
whatever specific thing you received in that session also i just want to mention that like in
the situation you envision here which is a communal situation um
the benefits of the work of the healer when when they are not inhibited by transactional
sort of the dead bloom thing when they when the sort of the patient or whoever the person receives those
benefits it's a completely different way of receiving them and it is it's much more easily transmitted
to the whole right it doesn't just heal that person right whereas in the transactional situation it tends to
be highly localized in time in relation in place all these things yeah totally and there's a scarcity to
it you know there's like i need to make money and so you know here is my one hour right and then i got
to close it after an hour you know no matter what's happening i'm closing this after an hour yeah and this
is the service i'm providing and that's what it is and that's what you paid me for and you got to pay me
more for this thing and you know it totally makes sense why people are in that because that's the
transactional system but if you break that then even if it ends up being an hour and it's the same
thing it's just there's a spaciousness to it that is not even remotely the same even if it's the same
thing you know it's yeah it's like the poisonous thing is filled with all these false membranes
membranes and they're dead they're like walls whereas the other thing is filled with living
membranes and they transmit right so the benefit and the wealth and the healing and the insight and
the love it's constantly magnified this is how nature works right the idea that nature is like
red and tooth and claw and a bunch of competing organisms it's insane it has nothing to do with
what nature is like it's the tiniest part of it yeah um it's massively symbiotic yeah right so the
walls are there but they're alive right and they transmit and receive naturally they give the benefit
back and forth all the time they magnify that benefit dramatically this is sort of why life can be
locally negantropic in a way i think what do you mean by the walls are alive like i think skims of the
animals the surfaces of the leaves the bark of the trees right root surfaces oh the walls are alive
right so they're like there's an exchange happening there all the time right they're giving constantly
giving and receiving to everybody yeah it's it's mutual benefit for everybody and there's a little bit
of well this stuff this you know animal eats that animal but even when that's going on a lot of the time
what's being some of the time what is happening is that a there's a bunch of things happening that
humans are not going to figure out but sometimes what's happening is that a predator is rescuing
another animal from an agonizing long death right the predators select disoriented creatures sick
creatures right it's not just not just out there like can i get a gazelle today right there's they
they're on if you watch nature and you watch predators you'll see how they select prey and they don't
just like go for whatever they can find you know if they're starving they might but in a situation where
they're reasonably well fed they're highly selective and they often select the weak the sick the disoriented
the dying you know and so in at least some cases perhaps not all or even a majority but some
um an animal that would otherwise suffer a lingering agonizing death right is given
the opportunity to get out over you know a span of 40 seconds two minutes right yeah it's interesting
perspective i mean i guess what comes to me then is like the babies because i feel like often predators
we eat babies well babies are just food in nature everybody knows babies are food right that's just
that's just the thing the babies are food yeah yeah the thing with the walls and the living walls
the human equivalent of that feels like what we were talking about earlier where like
you're in a role i'm in a role we have a closed dead wall versus you're a living being i'm a living
being and then we have this permeable wall where our living surfaces oh the shell i just like if we don't
have a shell we're just in ourselves as beings then our our actual living energetic membranes are
touching also in our language like yeah yeah they're touching and then within that we might like
set boundaries or you know to make agreements or you know there's it's not like we're just like all
just like in an orgy suddenly like there's still boundaries yeah but there are the boundaries are of
two living things like and there's permeability and like things are moving okay when those are
established together the membranes intelligently intermesh right yeah right and when they're fluid
yes yeah and when they're established um by rote or role they don't do that exactly they're highly
limited highly limited in their capacity to to mesh and and support each other yeah and they're they're
dead and there's the channels between them i almost i have the visual of like a trickle right yeah
i'm in my shell you're in your shell yeah yeah and then we can't we have this like predetermined
role-driven connection and it's not not nothing is coming through but it's like a trickle and i
receive a little trickle from you and i'm like ah you know thirsty like give me the little trickle
and it's like drop drop drop versus the easy so and then and then you're in this like oh my god i
gotta establish all these channels and there's this scarcity and you know yeah that leads to things like um
um you know if you were to go to the average restaurant out here and buy a meal right say
you go down to gordo's down the street and get a burrito i'm gonna give you a four pound burrito
you can do that you go to one of these restaurants you're getting enough food for three people
right and what what that what that is actually representing is the lack of what you're talking
about here right so the humans are right consuming massive quantities of food in a way to make up for
what they're not receiving yeah totally relation they're just getting the drip feed relationally
right so they're like well i better i gotta make up for what you know this massive deficit that's been
building up over the past 15 years of my life or however long right totally i mean 94 yeah you know
or and all substances yeah yeah absolutely 95 of western capitalism western civilization is like
withdraw the everything that yeah in the like media vacuum meeting human needs is like so easy
like relation like you know we're wired to meet our own needs and each other's needs if we're in it if
we don't have all these systems and put like it's not that hard um the like the basic ones of like
relational intimacy community uh some level of like spaciousness and like self-connection and like
you know that etc like it's not hard at all but the structure is like you withdraw and actively repress
the things that would meet those needs and then you fill the hole with like all the consumerist things
that are all like marketing you represent you make things that vaguely represent the things that were
extracted exactly exactly and so you just basically you give them the wrapping paper by you take away the
chocolate and give them the wrapper exactly and then put some something inside that's not chocolate
but that kind of very vaguely reminds you the possibility of chocolate someday again in your
experience yeah yeah right which is hilarious right when people watch television and they watch shows and
i watch them too sometimes right i'm not without video entertainment but you know we don't have lives so
we watch other people living lives on screens really what are you serious like it's crazy why would you ever do that
and yet think about the prevalence of that behavior yeah i mean i do it sometimes too like yeah me too
it's hard not to in the world today i noticed that once i was i went on twitter like i very rarely go
on twitter but sometimes i have like spells where i just like go on twitter um and so i once you know
a few weeks ago i had a spell and so i was on twitter and i was like what am i doing here like this is not
i feel that this is not nourishing what the hell am i doing and i realized i wanted to really be like i wanted to
be part of my tribe and like just the gossip of the marketplace kind of you know like what's
happening in my tribe like who's saying what that kind of thing um but it was not actually satisfying
at all because i don't know any of these people you know or i vaguely vaguely know them and met them
once or something or um and even if even the ones i know what i'm reading on this screen is not actually
fulfilling that need at all because it's very it's it's not comparable to the i mean those
fucking objects themselves they are a replacement for something so astonishing that if we even knew
it existed we wouldn't do anything else until we got some of them yeah right they're a replacement for
uplink which is outside the human cognitium right like yeah there are intelligences we used to they
used to be with us and they're not anymore mostly i mean this is kind of a religious assertion but yeah
that thing represents the angel no for sure absolutely it's uplink yeah it's a representation
of it which to the hand is this thing right it's the thing that leads up system oh to what it's an
expression of yeah right totally yeah and it's i think until i experienced that myself i totally
misrepresented what it was oh yeah that's entirely natural yeah i mean also the humans are being sold
all kinds of models and ideas i think i thought it was like this instead of like this yeah like i
thought like here is me and my grounding is me and then i can connect to this and then i can connect to
the higher and god intelligence or whatever or i didn't call it god at the time but i felt there was
something but i start here and then i go upwards and this is like an addition and then now like now that
i've felt it it's actually like this like i'm just discovering what i actually am like i am this
i'm yeah exactly from this right and i'm just uncutting off my finger not even putting it back
on it was always this already i just wasn't feeling this part so not it's almost like nothing changes
because you're nothing and everything changes like nothing changes because it's not like you're adding
pieces to yourself you're not starting as a finger and now i'm adding all these pieces like
they're they're all there already you're just feeling them um and so you're the same person
and because you're no longer a person you're what you always were which is like a piece of the i call
it like the divine consciousness yes everyone has a different name for it sure it doesn't matter
what the name is no uplink or you know gaia or you know we can use different names for different purposes
and in fact this is another weird thing about language humans seem to think words have meanings
that's a really weird way to approach language because we use words to mean things to each other
so the words purely really serve us not we serve the words oh totally right um okay there's a couple
things maybe we'll take a break in a minute cool yeah there's a couple things you can keep going i
think for days we can just not eat here oh wow yeah it's been a while um okay so one of the things i
noticed when i had the insight about roles and how uh humans who are deprived of communality will
naturally adopt familiar roles producing drama triangles and you know all kinds of things um and as you can
see in the united states right now for example which i would argue is the primary petri dish for
information psyops and like information warfare you do military conflict is not required to defeat this
nation i mean it's really easy to just get us to attack each other and ourselves right um so yeah i
think we're we're the primary petri dish for electronic psyops um primarily emergent from
countries we consider as competitors or you know enemies russia china et cetera well i and i would say
from within as well that's true yeah absolutely that's an important we agree yeah that's absolutely
true i saw that as well um so there's something really trippy about improv my and this came to me
when i was thinking about my friend josephine who teaches acting in the uk um that's when i got the
whole thing of like oh familiar roles we know how those work oh improv we don't know how that works
that's kind of scary for us unless we gain experience with it together um but the weird thing is that
actors do this very ironic thing right where they take a structured role and they invest soul and life
into this sort of dead shell that's a script right and they bring it to life in a role which is an
astonishing and ironic kind of magical thing to do i'm not sure what to make of that yet but i find that
really trippy um a couple of other things i'll mention briefly in a single sensor system i have
to be right in any situation where people are habitually absent from a relationship
being right becomes really important and in any situation where people are present in a relationship
being beautiful together becomes more important oh yeah right and so which thing like how do you want to
live that's a big part of the nbc thing as well where a non-violent communication which is when
you're in that relational field together and you're turning to feelings and needs being right
completely dissolved and i've witnessed this many times it's like shocking you're like i literally
give zero shits about being right i just want my needs met and the being right was like a substitute
the same way we're talking about before when you remove the thing then you can you throw in all this
hijacking stuff like i have to be right i have to be right but no we don't give a shit about being
right we i mean in some ways we do but not in this like intense relational way like i must be right
over this person all that we want is to have our needs met so when that is just directly attuned to
like yeah the being beautiful together is just so naturally and easily becomes the primary thing and
like everything is different as you were saying before like your whole world just changes yeah the womb
uh rejects the artificial replacements of itself yeah yeah as we establish something within it that is
authentic yeah you know what you're talking about about technology is also important because i'm
something of a expert on the problems in human the human use of language and linguistic um conception
will you get rid of language no right you're not going to throw the language away how are you going
to do that right so what we do is we transform how and why we relate with and through language
because we're not going to get rid of it it's the same thing with technology yeah like so we're not
going to get rid of technology i mean barring you know we we blow up you know we wore ourselves back to
the stone age or whatever which isn't impossible i hope that doesn't happen i think there are some other
intelligences involved that would likely interfere if we try um and the other thing that you said
that's really interesting is well everything you said was really interesting um but the thing that
struck me is uh one of my close friends i'll call him dr b he absolutely despises mcgill christ um just hates him
and thinks that uh he doesn't understand that it's exactly these left hemispheric like faculties and behaviors
that allow humans to dissociate completely into an abstract dimension from which world-saving technologies
emerge right so he thinks these people are the scientists and the mathematicians and the
you know the the allopathic doctors and so forth these are the true messianic beings
and technology is going to save us of course technology is the only answer to the problems
that we have um which i think is bizarre but i'm glad somebody's presenting that idea to me so
uh i really am um yeah he despises mcgill christ and he spent many years forging a sword against him and
this is his sword he calls he doesn't call it this i do i call it ex frenics right these are people who've been
dissociated into wildly abstract mathematical you know the mathematicians the physicists the philosophers
the uh the experimentalists the empiricists these people uh the inventors the technologists all these
people right they're like they they can completely dissociate from their humanity into this extremely
complex manifold of variables that they can encompass and manipulate intelligently right yeah so these
are the ex frenics and that's a real thing unfortunately uh you know i've often said it's tragic
thing to have to say but i mean it no scientist with the slightest degree of ethical
soul soul soul would ever publish absolutely they should not under no conditions should those people
publish because everything they publish will be weaponized in the current situation the artificial
womb owns this planet now until there's something better there where they could trust that it won't
only be weaponized it's unethical to publish wow yeah it's a very extremist position but i think it's it's
important to entertain it yeah i'm getting like tingles from that yeah that connects to a big thing of heidegger
but i also don't want to like you know disembody it for myself into heidegger because it's a deeply held
thing for me as well which is all knowledge within all knowledge basically right now period in western
civilization holds within it the assumption the individualist assumption basically that
what a being is is already determined and it's like the simplest question that doesn't even warrant
asking what do you mean what is it being you're a being i'm a being you know i'm a subject that can
objectively relate to reality and can form understandings and you know and then layered
on top of that i have all these biases and stuff but those are like
biases on top of my like ability to relate to reality directly as a single subject
but that's like a totally false assumption because as we've been talking about like our beingness is
a total mystery and it's like relational and divine and like all kinds of other intelligences are
involved like we don't we've like preschool even before preschool like we're just like
i've got hammer yeah we don't know anything about that right really and you know other civilizations
some of them have gone farther than us and exploring that question but i think basically
no civilization or tribe has really gone all that far along that path because it's just like
like to truly study yourself
like uh you have to yeah you need like a new level of consciousness that we don't have that i don't
think humans have collectively had yet no no what's hilarious is that
it's very very easy for you and me to come together like two wings and make the bird that flies
no problem small and small numbers of humans you can do it right now you do it instantaneously there's
no barrier at all the problem is in the extended cohorts how do you how do you make something one
of the things that i think is plausible and perhaps a reasonable thing to do is to make something that's
so profoundly human and alive and vital and brilliant and amazing and joyful and loving that nobody wants
to be left out and it's just outcome it just you know outcompete yeah give them it has to be something we
do right it's not a thing we it's not like you tell people things and then they're like oh of
course right right you have to give them things to do together they got to feel it yeah also it has to
be enacted yeah because this is what we get we don't we get some kinds of rewards from speaking and stuff
i do but it's action together that really is rewarding right this is what you were talking about
like we live together we do the things together yeah um totally but yeah i think that the present
the sort of the moloch and the wetico and those those by the way i would argue those are absences
interesting they are not presences i i prefer to think of them as evacuations yeah that function as
if they are beings but they're not being right oh right this is how i often think of them and it's
very useful to notice this i've watched people relate with absences as if they were presences
very directly in relationships in their vocational lives in their educational lives i've seen over
and over again the humans become fascinated by an absence yeah that's right i have also yeah they relate
with it as if it's a presence so are there demons right are there team like demons in the sort of
christian sense not the greek one i'm not so sure but what there are are processes that capture humans
with absences
yeah i'm gonna write that down that example
it's very it's a very powerful perspective whether or not it's the only truth i'm not um i'm not a big
fan of single valued thinking yeah that's i mean that's you're basically verbatim stating heidegger so
that's oh you've come to the same conclusions as the best philosopher ever so that's a good sign
well i was shown these things i didn't i didn't like walk through walk to this uh castle on my own
right yeah i don't think anyone yeah who gets there does i mean my mind had a million mothers and fathers too
i mean at least a few hundred in authors yeah maybe maybe more yeah yeah i want to come back
to this knowledge thing and connect it to that as well um
so take a little break um well i don't think because i'm i have to leave around three-ish okay
and it's 245 okay so i say we kind of just keep going for another 10 15 minutes and then yeah yeah
um i'm definitely running out of steam but i think we could we could play with that we could
be like what happens in this like tail end like running out of steam zone maybe new insights will
emerge so yeah with the knowledge thing um
yeah there's this like i was like asimov's foundation kind of comes to mind a little bit
where there's this and heidegger says this as well like in terms of like what is the response to the
abandonment by being and the fact that for all of western civilization we've never once asked the
question like what is being we've only asked what are beings um and it's like refusal withdrawal silence
uh and i think that's the best way to pursue knowledge and i think this is i think this is
what part of why i got tingled when you said like to it never to never publish is the right like to truly if
you truly care about truth like really deeply care about it the bet the best the only thing really
to do is to withdraw from the constructs of knowledge in the western world not because they're wrong no
they are right in certain limited contexts and they're very high reasons why that's an important
thing to do but i'm listening yeah so not because they're wrong because then you know they're they're
not wrong like they're some of it is wrong a lot of it is right in a particular context but because it
doesn't get to the fundamental truth and the fundamental truth is like where where like the
divine is basically like the search for truth is the same as the search for the divine uh it's one path
towards that um and that is not in our we've it's exhausted like the current knowledge structure has
reached its culmination in terms of how far it can get towards that and it was solid it was kind of in
that direction but now it's like exhausted in going there and we're in the stage where the truth
seekers the only path is to withdraw from that and just be in this like primitive baby state in the
organic womb yeah actually it connects back to that pulling yourself out of the artificial womb
and back into the organic womb and being reconceived exactly reborn reconceived and then
you and then we're like the way we relate to knowledge then is very different from in the
artificial womb there's thousands of years of built-up knowledge and we've shells we stand exactly
on top of that in the organic womb though we're kind of just floating on our own and we're we're like
cavemen again like what the is happening like you know and then and so then what it means to advance
knowledge looks more like what the greeks were doing than what scientists today are doing which is like
first of all it's more philosophical not philosophical in the aren't sure kind of way but philosophical in
like chilo so close yeah just adoration of wisdom yeah like and wisdom as like what what am i or like
and then and then i dissolves and then you're like what you know and then what dissolves and then you're
like exactly yeah and then you really got to be in that for like quite a while i i'm still i don't think
i'm ready to not be in that still i'm like and for me poetry is the way is what emerges from that
and for different people it'll be some i think some art form is like some necessary we agree emergence
from that and you just got to be in that for a while and then we got to start being in it collectively
whatever that means like i don't think i've really gotten there yet in my own life but i'm building
towards it to like really be in that collectively not like kind of being that collectively but be like
really in this like childlike state of fully in the organic womb and like having the safety in our
relational field to be there together and not to like clench up clench up and be like oh i know things
i know just be like i don't know anything i don't have words
um and then i don't know i have no idea what's going to happen like because we don't know like
then there's this deep like unknowing and uncertainty and then with but but a deep knowingness within that
because like now i'm there like now i'm touching i'm not just touching i'm in i am truth i like oh
that feels right like i am truth now like i'm i'm living as truth and then you know that's that's the
only place to be and then it emerges from there it's one of the things i notice here is it's a
transformation of what what what what what to is huh yeah because what if you think carefully right what
is going on what am i what is that who is what are they doing what is it's objecting it's uh it's
dissociative right it takes you out of relation into uh the arbiter of values identity qualities
characteristics threats opportunities yeah um i i made a whole recording on the problem of what
and there's actually the send koan that's kind of hilarious in this regard uh what is the sound of
one hand clapping well it literally is what what what what right i mean that's not what the koan is
about the koan is about maybe you should think more carefully about this what
idea get really intimate with this what um and even the other koan the koan of moo which is just
really just a one word koan moo right but when it's presented what's moo what is moo right and so here's
a here's a this is ridiculous and i'm shamed that i'm going to do this but i'm going to do it anyway
because i'm a intellectual perhaps what uh joshi was saying when the monks asked him does do the
does the dog have food in nature or not and he said move perhaps what he was saying is
is one way to one way to intellectually encompass this which is the wrong thing to do that's why i'm
embarrassed is
is
no longer form the gesture of reference in words
rest without the gesture of reference now what and of course
now what it's not a what and the only way through that gate is to actually become
the non-referencing awareness
right
which is similar to what you were talking about when you said we don't have these roles
my dad my mother my sister my lover yeah
and then we're resisting the urge to make representational ref references tokens labels
yeah for our relationships and so then improvisation must naturally prevail yeah right right yeah i love
how all these things are interweaving yeah what's coming to me from that is because what you just
described is essentially like enlightenment you know like where you're just you've totally
beat myself up for having done just you've just described enlightenment what a stupid thing to do
stop that don't do that ever what were you thinking yeah it's interesting that you felt embarrassed
about describing enlightenment yeah um yeah but actually i think that's really relevant that you
felt embarrassed about it because um i gotta be careful how i weave in this good luck yeah i think
enlightenment or you know any religion or any like structure towards enlightenment
the same thing happens that we've been talking about where it gets hijacked yes it's like oh
it looks like you're seeing it it just loops back in yeah yeah this is why they burnt the zen
masters books and things like this right and when you break out of it actually authority dissolves
and like you know the buddha says you got to kill the buddha which means like you're literally just
being and then there's this like the the most important thing about that is there's this freedom in it
to be like i'm i'm uniquely being right now we're all uniquely being and our unique being is gonna
do things uniquely that haven't happened before so instead of like because when i was first
encountering buddhism or you know any kind of spiritual structure there's this um
um authority relationship to it where this is prescribing what the highest form of human existence
is and then i'm following its path to get there and this is i think a place where like actually i think
eastern culture falls short and western culture has a strength like the the divine form of the
the individualism of the west is um uh freedom to fully be without following an authority structure
which in the way it's captured exactly so the way it manifests in society right now is super
fucked and damaging and destructive and not like true to being so i'm not trying to like elevate the
way it currently exists as being a good thing necessarily but yeah it has the potential underlying
all the fucked up ways just like nuclear weapons right exactly exactly exactly it has the potential
to when we do enter a state of enlightenment and i feel like this is true for a lot of people
in the western world that are in some way shape or form like relating to that state is that there's
like whoa right this is something can happen that's never happened before for example like what we're
talking about where by being in that truth um there's a new path that can emerge beyond what's ever happened
before of like knowingness of being whatever that means we don't even know what like we it has nothing
to do with how we currently relate to knowing it just means something that uh
uh just almost breathes life the way what's coming to me is like breathes more life into that state
you know the same way that like science helps us breathe more life into like our material reality
you know like now we have we have air conditioning and all these things that enable us to just
have more space to hot water exactly hot water so it's a similar thing but how it's going to look no
fucking idea but breathing life and sustainability and growth into being so that it can like be nurtured
and that womb can grow and diversify and whatever wants to be born out of that
um but the the core thing that i guess i'm going to repeat here just to like really nail that
is like we can be in a state of enlightenment i almost don't even want to use that word because
it's a referential word that has a lot of this baggage with it a state of being let's just say a
state of being a non-referential state the isness where the what is dissolved awareness awareness
um is this feels even deeper deeper truth and awareness uh we can let go of all the authorities
built up around what that is like buddhism you know taoism christianity whatever uh
structure and kind of explore it as like primitive cavemen or babies or something like that
and recognize that we live in a unique society that is not at its foundation is not all horrible
its manifestation a lot of it is really horrible but like i was just saying with the core of
individualism what lies under there can be redirected or even ai i think is the thing that recently i've
been exploring a bit more where like the way it manifests for the most part is continuing the deadening
in a very rabid way that's terrifying but at the same time it can also be like a reflective mirror of
like isness consciousness and can enhance that so i'll just say that there's all these tools and
all these things in western society that they all manifest in very negative ways a lot of them do
but they have a core energy underneath them that from the isness place can become unique strengths
that have never existed in any other civilization or tribe that reach that isness and can generate
like a deeper beingness than has ever happened like ever like you know like which is there's a birthing
there that is that is unique and and that is not and then you know then there's a tendency like oh i
want to predict it like what's it going to be what are the characteristics how do i you know exactly and
then but then you're immediately out of business and you're just back in this representational format so
there's a total unknowingness in that except that it's there or that it is something like that
yeah yeah i'll leave it at that that was a whole monologue but it's all good yeah i'm also feeling
that same almost embarrassment of talking about enlightenment things it's kind of interesting
that we both have that feeling i tend to uh espouse a perspective of anti-mechanism
and there's a lot of reasons why i do that uh i love the living beings it's very clear that the
humans intend to extinguish those so the machines are the primary means of that extinguishing yeah but
i am aware just like you are that the technology is here so it's probably not going to go away which
means we have to turn it to uh what we could call is isness purposes or authentic wound uh purposes
right and it's not fundamentally opposed to that no it's not like in current practice it is but it
doesn't yeah i mean i'm a little touchy about that because i've heard this over and over again guns don't
kill people people kill people yeah yeah well you make billions of guns guns kill people yeah right i
mean you the humans i don't i don't i've said this before i wouldn't trust modern humans with silverware
i don't want them to have computers or bombs or guns or any of that stuff if it were up to me but um
but i see the same point you see and i also like language language is a huge problem for humans but
we're not going to get rid of it so we have to learn together what we can do how we can see
um to revise the relationship with the tool that has captured us yeah totally yeah the tool that has
become our master and slaver yeah yeah it's weird from from millennia ago yeah i think that it's not a
new thing like no no it's the problem with this thing actually right the powers of this thing are really
complicated yeah and fascinating yeah cool it seems like uh yeah three o'clock is a perfect moment to end
ah beautiful thank you yeah
yeah what a field we've created together indeed yeah i think we shall continue absolutely yeah bye
all right
you
