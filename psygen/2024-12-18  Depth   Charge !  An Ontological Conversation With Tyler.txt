so um one of the amazing features of your core ontology uh is precisely
an array of insights that arise from my toy of the dandelion
right um does this make any sense why i'm saying that yet not yet okay it's going to so
dandelion toy is a model of everything so it's a it's a hyper four or a uniform
right single a single right one ring to rule them all it gives you a base ontology
about everything what everything is and the way it works is it
so the important feature of the toy is the idea
that or the perspective that um the universe many uncountable times per picosecond
collapses to perfect unity exchanges information and then re-expands to distinction
and so everything you see every organism in fact language physics all these things these are
the results of this process over what we can imagine is linear time
and by the way in the collapse phase all of time is there and it's together so most of the time there's
no time um and your ontologies how you think about for example what plants do
um and their structure and it's you know their it's relationship to itself it's an emergent ontology
and it emerges from in my understanding of it and maybe i'm misunderstanding but i doubt it
so far um it emerges from that shared information in the collapse phase gets uniquely encoded and re-expressed
in each expansion phase and so naturally the plant is a hole over time that emerges to our perspective
as a developmental arc but it's always it's unity does that make any sense
yeah and i can't articulate your view of the natural forms of organisms well but i understand something
about its root principles i think um so why don't you just uh riff for a moment on your ontology of organic
forms if you wouldn't mind well with with respect to plants specifically um the whole organism
reappears within each part or region which is what i tend to think of in terms of
um holography or some kind of holographic process because the presence of a whole in a part is linked
to what i regard as memory so you know specifically the process of red integration so recovering a whole
through a part is a feature of memory and therefore consciousness because i think consciousness and memory
are intimately uh related so our perception is always already a kind of memory um because the past
the past perpetually enters the present like a stream
so our perception is a kind of loop a kind of circuit or a kind of integrated hole in which
holes appear but i think what takes place in the body of the plant specifically or most clearly is the
recovery or uh resuscitation of some kind of primordial hole through um a discrete region of space so it
works just like the mind i think it works uh like consciousness so the evolution of the plant is
synonymous with or analogous to uh the same kind of act that takes place in perception itself so that
was why i was so interested in in direct realism as a theory of perception um because of course it
it pertains to you know color theory but i think it also pertains to the reality of wholeness or units
within space so there's a relationship between optics and botany uh in my view for that reason uh
uh yeah it basically has to do with the fact that the morphology of the plant as it develops through time
and space um takes place through the same kind of process that takes place in the mind so um so the
mind is really something that you can see taking place in the external world as living entities there's
some kind of connection for me yeah between between what takes place in the subject and what takes place
in the objective environment yeah there's like 12 reasons why i'm laughing here the first is uh
the the heroism of your life and mind and its attempt to survive and prosper
in a field of human cognition and activity and behavior
that might as well just be like pure uranium 238 or totally lethally wrongly radioactive all around you
and the puzzlement that must arise in you as a human being to find yourself in such a bizarre predicament
um so like your actual capacity for insight is so absurdly hyperbolized over your peers
i mean so you know there's people walking around you're like i'm from another planet and tylus walk
around going like i'm from another you i'm from like an array of other universes you're from another planet who
cares like how tediously ordinary um so there's that and there's also like
you're literally like the mind of toy maker half embodied in a human
sort of without contact with its own origins right so you're like um
you're like the hand of 12 kinds of nhi disconnected from the wrist that would allow you to you know
like prosper and feel like you belonged and understand your own like the meaning of your
existence and stuff like this and you're just heroically
like um wadib in the desert right you're drinking the water of life but you don't know where it comes
from and you've never met the beny jesserits yeah right so you're just out there like doing this
impossible thing almost entirely alone you know one man against the you know against the entire
momentum of the history of cognition in humans right in a world where tyler arises and has no idea
yeah it's really it's amazing um okay but back to more uh mundane features of our conversation so
you have elucidated key features of how to validate the dandelion toy
that that are like the um key to the lock that the dandelion is and let me see if i can explain why
that's how that is so so when you say things like the past is flowing into the form of an organism
and i'm sure you think this of all organisms and probably even rocks and you know planets and solar
systems galaxy because it's not right it can't be just if i understand you it can't just be the
organisms that are like this i got you correct on that right yeah it's all it's it's a it's an ontology
over the nature of matter and time things so when you say that the past is presently flowing into
the form of the plants or the animal um i would add that also too is the future
disagree no great and so when the dandelion collapses
um it's it's not a sphere it's a non-ordinary geometric construct that is hyperdimensional in
my view but it's very difficult to say to ordinary humans what what these words mean
um but if we treat it as a sphere
um and we think for a moment stupidly but this we're just trapped this way a little bit
um of the beginning of time and the end of time right the beginning of time and the end of time
if we're thinking linear linearly and we presuppose something like a big bang which i don't think is
real but we're going to go ahead and do that for a minute anyway then at the big bang the beginning
and the end are the same thing and then they expand for the first time and those and then they are
differentiated and when they do that there is more beginning and more end and when they're doing it now
there is more beginning and more end with each expansion and collapse so at the end of time
is not the barrier across which time ceases rather it is the current phase state of the relationship
between the origin and the boundary and so with each collapse of the dandelion poof everything goes unified
time is gone distinction is gone poof everything goes separate again and this is just a toy
um now there's more history and there's more future there is a bound on the future but it's
not the cessation of time at the end it's simply the boundary uh imposed by the most recent expansion
and collapse phase does that make any sense yeah great so what's happening in the plants just like
what's happening in my own hand is that the entire possible the entire possibility space of the history
and the future of hands is producing my hand right now
and so the hand appears stable in momentary linear time but it's actually not just the history of the
development of hands on earth it's the history and future of the possibility space of anything
resembling a hand in all of time and space localized localizing as my hand
and the same thing is true of minds right um except that the humans are trapped in like
i don't know one one thousandth of a dimension of its actual
fucking possibility space because of their weird relationship with language and tech
sure um but the possibility space of minds is infinite
and so when you look at a raccoon what you're seeing is the entire history and future
of that branch of the possibility space of embodying intelligence in material you know
in in a material mode
and the raccoon also what you're seeing in the raccoon is if you see a raccoon
you are seeing all raccoons
not just all raccoons that are alive
all raccoons that have ever lived or will ever exist thoughts
right yeah that makes sense so there is no there really is no such thing as a part
there aren't any parts yeah right the whole idea of parts is just mistaken
you can throw that away and you'd be much better off
i often um often analogize humans as swimmers who can't wait to grab another anchor
show them any anchor and they grab it and then they're like you know they're trying to swim
they're like oh swimming is really hard and stuff right now can i have another anchor please
you know they're just collecting anvils
you know or birds who are tropic to chains like any chain in a storm i want it give me that
we will sing the praises of flying while nailing ourselves to walls
and our children and each other and then we will be moan the poor state of our children
and the world so yeah you have the keys to um elucidating the proof of the dandelion in the forms
of material existence but particularly your focus is on things like light and organisms i think
that's right and time yeah time agreed yeah it's really trippy that we met and very um pretentious in my
view
you are alone in a circle like i have many brilliant friends but there's nobody like you that has these
ideas you've carefully cultivated and curated an array of key ideas um you are a philosopher par excellence
in my view uh and knowing you is like you know meeting good or something
yeah it's yeah well i feel like a curator yeah you are you're excellent at it you're and you're forensic
about it so can you see why i uh why i highlight the dandelion toy yeah it makes more sense to me now i
can see and um you know one of the more recent developments which wasn't articulable to me though
i was aware of it was just the um
um so the way the structure of the layers of the collapse and the expansion work
and you can you can do it either way it doesn't matter what which you put at the outside really
uh some putting it putting some things at the core and some things at the outside are
more useful for certain purposes than they are for others but if you put origin at the core
and what you have at the core is something like pure transcendental impossibility like that just can't exist
and that's the progenitive force and then the next layer would be something like
um possibility the next layer would be probability meaning at this layer
probability uh is the um character of that layer and this is why this is partly why humans in trying
to understand quantum mechanics play a bunch of probability games
and certain people were pissed about that einstein being one of them
um they just don't understand that before the layer where things become uh relatively determinate
that's born underneath that is the impossible underneath above that is the improbable above that is the
probable above that is the semi-determinant that's where free will works
so it's both true and untrue that we have free will right at the determinate layer it's determined
right at the layer right underneath that it's probabilistic at the layer right underneath that
it's possibleistic and at the layer underneath that it's impossible so all those things are true
and people are like do we have free will or not well you know wrong question why don't you try to
understand the nature of origin and its relationship with its layers right and with this model most of
the questions fall away the questions that humans pose most of those just look like nonsense because
they don't realize they think there's one layer yeah they're trying to figure out what's going on in the layer
um you know i was thinking yesterday about the double slit experiment and um
i realized that probably what is going on in the determinate layer
is the appearance of the ghosts of the activities in the other layers
and what light's actually doing is it's exploring the entire possibility space over all the layers
and all of time and then selecting the best route and as the photon
splits into trillions of potential experiments for the sake of exploring that space
it naturally produces both particles and waves right if you singularize the photon you get a particle
if you don't you get waves because that's that's it's almost as if there's only a single photon
right so there's only one okay but at the determinate layer it it looks like all the photons
there's something weird about the possibility of of there only being single particles that i find fascinating
so yeah it occurred to me that the reason we get the appearance of waves
is that we're causing
by creating a choice we're causing light to explore the entire possibility space of that choice instantaneously
and since we're in linear time where things are determinate that creates interference patterns
ah i see okay
also attempting to force um the humans are really dumb about forcing choices
i think that forcing choices tells them what things are doing
hilariously stupid
anything with any insight at all would realize
you're putting your finger in the pie that you're attempting to pull your finger out of to
determine what the pie is
right so like one one of the experiments that i love is um
in laboratories humans attempt to recreate the um
the circumstances of a previous earth where life arose right the the evolution of life on earth
laboratory problem and the humans are like well we want to subtract all intelligent influence from
this little ball of glass in which we're going to do stuff but you made the ball of glass you made the
laboratory we're gonna how are you going to subtract yourself there's no way to subtract yourself from
an experimental context i'd love to see anyone even partly succeed at that at the deterministic level
you can get the appearance of it does that make sense what i'm saying yeah i think so
so the humans are like we want a situation in which there's no intelligent influence
but you're composing the situation so how can you subtract the fact that you composed it
right well the assumption is that the external environment is fundamentally unintelligent
so yeah the assumption is that intelligence resides in the subject which is the mistake
yeah the intelligence is in the environment not in you right you inherit the intelligence from the
dandelion in my view or actually it's even you don't exist the dandelion exists as you
and you are confused about this and think you are a distinct thing
that can determine the operations of the thing you have evacuated yourself from
i love it it's like a question of um i want to find out if pies arise in ovens
so i build a bunch of ovens and then separate them from all humans
and then go around examining them for evidence of pies
can borscht arise in a random pot by itself
this is the life this is the human's view of the origin of life
i think the earth is separate they're separate time space is dead it's just a machine and they're
they're wondering like can a machine produce organisms accidentally if you make it complex enough
the tragic uh and you know if not so dire it would be totally hilarious it would be the greatest joke
but it's it's pretty dire around here because there are beings imprisoned in that
so what do you think of my proposition that organisms are a platform for the uh materialization
i mean i think it i think it aligns with my own point of view um broadly
because when i look at it it's something like an octopus or a jellyfish or a whale or a raccoon and
particularly a praying mantis what i'm seeing is like okay dude you humans are confused you're
surrounded by the things you think are aliens this is a planet in space it's chock full of aliens
what were you thinking
yeah i tend to see organisms as different forms of time itself so
i see organisms as different tempos or rhythms which probably contain certain numbers or um like
symmetries so in the same way that the body of the plant contains a certain number of waves i suspect
that other uh other organisms like animals contain a similar kind of wave-like structure which is just
much more complicated than what takes place in a plant um and that that complication or that structure
i think arises through the introduction of something like a point or a locus within the body and
therefore like a more determinate uh circumference or periphery so the yeah so the expansion takes
place with respect to a point in the animal body whereas in the plant body its own morphology really
reflects uh space at large it's a kind of embodiment of uh certain holographic properties of space itself
whereas the animal body by moving through space um you know gesticulating itself um its metamorphosis or
its evolution uh is really self-governing because it takes place with respect to its own center
yes this all makes sense um in one sense you're saying
plants are more like because they don't move around in the same way that the animals do in space
plants perhaps are more time-like and animals are more space-like no yeah in a certain sense yeah
and you're doing the same thing that the dandelion proposes which is that you see
that origin is central to form and central meaning like that point you're talking about right that
point is a point of the origin of a locus in space time yeah right and in the animal
because the locus is mobile it has a different relationship to both time and space
space than say a tree does um right so it's a it's a unique mode of the possibility
space of form in in time space yeah precisely yeah so perception arises through motor activity
which originates or appears with the animal kingdom in a way which is missing in the plant kingdom
um but whereas the plant kingdom so the plant body is a kind of emblem of space in which really something
like the totality of space appears as a kind of song or a kind of sigil um its evolution is really
bound up with its environment so it it mirrors its environment so the plant is a kind of mirror of its
uh environment which is really the the total cosmos because because of this this lack of any determinate
boundary or center so the plant really loses itself in matter it loses itself in its environment
whereas with the animal body this circumference allows it to develop with respect to its own center
with its own uh motion so what we call perception or consciousness is really a kind of feedback loop
uh in which motor activity is thrown back and appears as a kind of object yeah so i think your perception
of your environment is a direct function of your own motor activity um so whatever that process
is is we call it perception or consciousness um the plant body experiences something i think radically
different from it uh so yeah qualia and locomotion are bound together so an organism that moves itself through
space uh uh generates uh qualia a kind of qualitative perception of its environment
uh oh there's so much here that's astonishing um so one of the implications of what you were saying
is that you used the word numbers earlier um but i think with probably more like what you meant
rather than numbers is the idea that i have of the mathematical concept of a manifold
right which is an n-dimensional space um over the possibility space it uh
it both creates and inhabits um it partly invents it and it partly inherits it
but what i mean by a manifold is like a bubble of many bubbles except it's not a physical bubble of
many bubbles it's a trend it's a trans-dimensional bubble of many bubbles and so when you say numbers
in the sense that you said earlier i think what you're implying is something related to our d
our idea and experience of music right it's like a broad array of resonant frequencies um held in coherence
by the point of existence and origin differently in the plant and the animal and the mind
uh now it should be obvious to anyone thinking about this that the plants um modify the possibility space of a
planet in such a way that animals become possible right no plants no animals okay so the plants are actively
modulating modulating the possibility space and holding um in that possibility space an array of manifold like
features that create and sustain the possibility space of animals and the animals similarly
enhance the possibility space of the plants right and also hold the manifold for the possibility space of
embodied consciousness does this make any sense what do you think so yeah you're talking about a complex
symphony of manifold producing entities in form and matter that each contribute to another layer
within and we could think of as above or below depending on how we want to think we'll call it above
because humans like to think that way above the previous possibility space so um cells have to be
present before you can get plants it seems and possibly although i think this is a weird idea viruses have
to be present before you can get cells but i don't know about that one that's highly controversial
um and once you get plants the possibility of things like insects and animals arise
and once you get those the possibility of minds as we understand them though it seems to me that probably
cells and plants have some array of qualities that are perhaps pre-mind like but nonetheless related what do you think
i love that chuckle yeah well so the plant is a kind of circuit um but its metamorphosis takes place with respect
to a pre-existing unit which is what i was relating to number so um within that loop or within that circuit
you can see how the plant is internally reflected a certain number of times so yeah these are the waves
these are the waves right that arrive over linear time with each wave uh informing the structure and nature of the plant i think
what are you right yeah okay so it's its internal reflection takes place with some with respect to
something that already exists so this kind of unit pre-exists the appearance of the plant in space and time
yes and so the plant is expressing the flow of this is what i was this is what i mean by the possibility
space and then that leading to the probability space and then that leading to the semi-determinant space
and then that leading to the determinant space yes yeah yeah so what takes place in perception or
consciousness is something quite similar because the manifestation of light is already a kind of
composite product of a process that involves something invisible so when we look at space
i think we would be mistaken to imagine that space is simply some kind of layer or like a monolithic
uh singular uh container right yeah what takes place in space
i think can only be explained with respect to this kind of deeper um holographic process that the plant
exhibits but which is also implicit in uh visions in the in the in the process of perception talk some
okay go ahead i want to interrupt you yeah so so when you look at your environment you you you see
what appear to be solid objects but that perception of solidity is already the product that reflects a
deeper layer so so something invisible is actually requisite to the appearance of matter in space
um which can be modulated or changed through time so so once you change the rate or the tempo of duration
um the object itself changes so so so the mistake i think is to imagine that events take place in time i think the more
the more clear perspective is to is to recognize that that beings or objects themselves are what time is
so there isn't there aren't beings in time that's not like a coherent point of view as far as i can tell
a being itself is what time itself is so as soon as you modulate the tempo the being itself changes
so what you see in your environment as so many beings is already a kind of uh uh a kind of like composite
image yeah so as you change that tempo your perception of space changes
it's not as if so time isn't like a a tape moving from you know one end to another end like a
uh nope like a vhs tape right we have this kind of linear uh you know ordering of events
uh so so the idea that to speed time up would mean something like you know fast forwarding through some
clip right that's not actually what takes place i think if you were to speed time up you would see
different objects in your environment it wouldn't be as if you were simply uh you know fast forwarding
through some kind of spatial container um so the being itself is a is a tempo it's a it's a kind of
speed um so that i think what modulates that speed um is something like feedback so as you enhance
feedback you see i think perhaps more in space so it isn't as if you know space is a singular noun
um one second on the phone yeah space isn't a singular noun in the sense that um actually you're
saying something i think that's much weirder than this there is no space that thing you're calling space
you're confused about that yeah it's all time so there there are different species of time
so what we call space is simply uh you know simultaneity it's like the simultaneous appearance of
beings that's what we call space but um yeah
yeah i mean to me space time say again it's it's it's just feedback uh-huh well it's also the between of
beings and that between is filled okay so try to imagine what i'm actually proposing with the dandelion
that all separate beings most of the time are one thing let's call it a speck okay and
that speck all the appearance of distinct beings is really that speck um
um distributing itself over the possible over all possibility spaces
in the expanded moment where things appear separate right so what happens is
all of time and space and being collapse they share information about that they got while distinct
that allows them to traverse possibility spaces in the expanded aspect right so that some beings
can drag information in fact they all do um and this is what consciousness actually is it's what memory
is too it's just that at the surface level memory looks like recording from one perspective it isn't
it's actually um relation so it's a mode of relation but at the expansion phase where you have all these distinct
beings the reason things appear solid in matter is just due to the rate of the expansion and collapse of the dandelion
so it's a kind of persistence of vision but it's in matter there are no objects
the existence of objects is an illusion produced by the activity of the dandelion
what's actually going on is a form of transcendent unity pervading over the determinate space
does it make any sense at all what i just ridiculous things i was just saying
yeah i think so um so yeah if okay so now this brings up a couple of possibilities that i think are intrinsic
to consciousness um somebody who could for example follow the collapse okay with their consciousness
right follow the collapse down to the point of unity they would have complete knowledge of all previous states
of beings and situations in the expanded state and all future states so they would be perfectly
prophetic if they did that perfectly what would happen
what would happen is that they would present an anomaly in the expanded version of the dandelion
like some kind of bizarre um science fiction like anomaly of like this person has just turned into light
or something right it's like we see the form of human but there's no human there it's just the sort of
transcendent illumination walking around on the planet and this is what the idea of jesus and the buddha and so forth is a
is a representation of effectively right um this is someone who has learned to drag the unity back up the tree
um of the distinction process into the determinate space
and uh
all right so then there are lesser versions of that so my friend marla who i interviewed the other day
who is a psychic that claims to talk to dead people and i think her claims are relatively viable actually
um what she's doing is she's just following a specific being in front of her the person who
she's doing the work for right she's following that being she doesn't know this but she's following them
back to unity and she's dragging information back from from the collapse to unity into the distinguished
phase at the edge of the bubble of the dandelion where we think and live and so she can see quote unquote
um what happened to this person as a child events that took place in their past
past and she can reunify them with features of the dandelion that still exist that she calls their dead
relatives who are actually not dead in point of fact the weird thing is
if we were thinking about this from the perspective of the dandelion to be alive is the dead phase
and to be dead is to be in unity yeah that reminds me of yeah something i was going to say great go for
it oh i mean i just tend to imagine that what we perceive as distinction in space and time is just a
reflection of our own morphology whereas if you were to follow that unity back as you mentioned
that trajectory i think would coincide with a kind of physical death so to perceive unity is to lose
your own reflective relation to your physical mantle basically yeah so yeah that kind of it aligns
with what you're saying because um because the the embodied state would be a kind of
disintegrated state yes which distinction arises but that distinction is only a reflection of your
own body really it's like i was saying how perception is a kind of feedback loop where your
own motor activity is reflected back that's that's what appears as distinction in space and time it's
really just you but when your physical body uh vanishes what you what you find yourself with is this kind
of more primordial unity or wholeness yes which of course we approach in um dreaming non-ordinary experience
right we're half missing part of us goes missing over here and it arises in the unity space and suddenly
you have a psychic or you know any one of millions of children now alive on this planet
who have not yet fully left the unity space and the humans think oh those children are dumb they don't know
what's going on no no it's the other way around you adults are idiots and the children are transcendent
they're still partly transcendent they don't know what to do with it because they're in a body
and they're surrounded by extremely ignorant adults that are trying to get them to learn language
and cultural nonsense and and punishing them and rewarding them right so the and the adults take the
place what happens in childhood is a transfer of the expectation of the presence in awareness
of what we could think of as an angel or all the angels as one angel right with the child's mind
accompanying it into right following it into incarnation and companion with it and we're like
you know my children my child has an imaginary friend you're an idiot your child doesn't have an imaginary
friend you completely insane fucking broken monkey your child is the presence of an array of
transcendent intelligences from origin that exist outside of time right um and you having lost that
think that your child is confused okay um it's just so ironic right if if again if it weren't so dire it
would be a hilarious four-frame cartoon you know or comic um but the children so as that intelligence
fade begins to fade in the child and mostly what causes its fading is the introduction of representational
cognition which compromises the transports that connect the child to origin and the the non-ordinary
intelligences that it is an instance of it doesn't have a relation it's not connected to them it is an
exemplar of them right just like my hand of my body the child's awareness is an exemplar of those
intelligences and so what happens is that retcog captures the resources that are used to sustain
uplink what i'll call uplink and it it
it's causes their sclerosis in consciousness and that's what breaks the connection
now this is just a model right i'm just making a model here a toy of the situation but the toy
is much more accurate than those we usually right employ i love when you snicker because i know what that
means
well on that note i actually have to run no problem this is great so i'm gonna post this as soon as i can
if that's cool with you sure that's yeah fine right on that's good just want to make sure we're agreed
yeah i really appreciate you and this talk so amazing uh like resurrection from retcog while we're
still alive yes right i love you man all blessings all right man yeah i'll talk to you later okay peace for
now all right peace
so
you
