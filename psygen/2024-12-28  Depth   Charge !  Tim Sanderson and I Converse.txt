hey tim great to see you again
likewise i'm excited as always about a chance to explore together
yeah me too so we were just talking about um
the labels that we use to to both describe and reject features of our humanity
and how ironic this becomes um i remember i saw a meme on facebook yesterday that said that was
discussing how uh the idea of masculinity was socially constructed
and and i just thought like okay are there features of identity or characteristics that
aren't socially do we have any labels that aren't socially constructed because
you know apparently if it's socially constructed we should reject that
you know and i was like well we would have to reject everything i mean just you know
every every bit of language for a start right because it's all socially like tree is socially
constructed you know so that's the problem if that's like the demon in our in our headlights
we're in bad trouble because there are no non-demons if you use those headlights demons appear everywhere
you know it's uh i think it's a symptom of the times isn't it that everything is basically
in a kind of liquid state and flowing and you know in and breaking and reforming and nothing that
anyone thought was true is true or well not nothing but you know what i mean it's like everything
all the different rules and guidelines and foundations that we built everything on it all just seems to be
liquid so i don't know it's quite interesting it feels i always felt like we've been slowly atomizing
into our constituent parts socially and maybe internally maybe in our personalities as well to some
degree i don't know but it just feels like we've we've got so far in this process of atomization that
we're now in this kind of fluid state where strange combinations can just come back together or i know
it's a very it's a challenging time but it's a very interesting one as well for me personally anyway
so many features of what you're sharing there that are
important and that i want to explore um so a couple that come to mind immediately is the um
are two things particularly uh what i call war mind which is where something stirs the humans up much like
uh in hymenophtra if you are near a wasp nest and you swap one of them
right the whole they release they mark you they release pheromones and the whole nest just goes war
mind right and now it's just like you know destroying at any cost right we'll die we don't doesn't matter
just go nuts right and um then the other is this sort of okay uh here in the united states i can't speak for
other countries we are ground zero for we are the petri dish for informational psyops and one of the
primary um motivations of those psyops is simply to factionate us further because to whatever degree we
can be factionated you don't have to fight us we'll fight ourselves for you right um but there's lots of
other weird experiments going on that aren't quite so uh you know obvious um and uh sort of co-extant
with this war mind thing is something we in the united states are trained to each generation uniquely
and i suspect in the uk and other you know sort of western what we think of as western nations
it's similar but you know we grew up watching shows on tv like perry mason right he said he's a
courtroom lawyer yeah yeah yeah and so a vague recollection and and so we were inculcated with
courtroom consciousness we were trained to script and think uh about possible courtroom scenarios
and one of the features that's become prevalent in the fascinating and terrifying um american
uh a sort of clinical analysis of linguistic features particularly identity labels
is this courtroom mind so there's a there's a mode of virtue signaling
where you call out some word or clade or cohort as you know these are the bad colonial you know uh
patriarchal uh you know gender specific people um and there are good and bad features of this
but it's pretty virtue it's really weird because they'll call people out for virtue signaling while
they're virtue signaling right like i'm virtue signaling by calling out virtue signalers and so
there's this sort of recursive weird tornado like thing going on related to what you're talking
about with the atomization like what once the atomization happens what what are the ways that it
starts to form little um dust devils in uh social and linguistic cognition so these are some of the
things that that occur to me and and i think they're look i'm a troubleshooter so i'm gonna see the
problem right and i'm gonna see the danger and i may not be paying a lot of attention to any of the
the positive features because i figure like well those will take care of themselves they don't need me
you know i'm unsure to fix stuff yeah no i i hear you i've got a similar problem noticing anymore
yeah well you know noticing always it seems like i'm completely wired to be always looking for the
problems so i can fix them yeah there's nothing masculine about that that's that's not a part of
our gender or anything oh no definitely not yeah well exactly you know it's that it's just that kind
of and it and it uses that very kind of left brain yeah dart attention it's like look look look what
needs what can i do how can i change what can i change what can i adjust to make this work better
whatever it is whether it's a mechanical thing a relationship something happening in nature you
know rain coming in through the roof whatever it is it there's and also even to the extent where
i'm pre-empting i think a lot of the way i live is pre-empting problems and making sure they never occur
and there's a kind of art to that where you're you know you're spinning the plates and you just made
once you get them all spinning then you're just just maintaining it so that you know something
doesn't go wrong but um yeah i think it's uh it's a strategy i've used for a long time but it's
it occasionally fails massively because the world just isn't like that so it's very humbling as well
to be shown that your one way of dealing with the world doesn't always work um in fact i think that's
where i've got to lately is is sort of opening up to perhaps different ways of taking on the world
other than that one you know i've been pretty good at that other one and done quite well out of it but
it doesn't cover all situations and all eventualities yeah yeah i was a i still am a professional
technical troubleshooter so i worked with apple systems and was particularly working with publishers
and designers and architects and stuff and uh eventually i it became obvious that i had a sort of
preternatural um sixth sense uh to use the old language so that and also the the other weird thing
about people who repair mechanical things uh we all know the story of you bring your car to the mechanic
right and he starts it up and the problem isn't there right you take it home there it is again right
so i would occasionally have something like that right i would show up and the problem would just
disappear it's like oh the shepherd's here all the sheep go right into place you know they just
recognize the presence of the shepherd and it sounds weird because we wouldn't think that machines are
like that but computers are really weird machines um and then the other thing was i would just come and
and i would see the person's face and i would immediately know exactly where the complex like i would
see like somehow an integration of over the history of the situation i just feel like oh it's this
like but you haven't even looked at the machine i'm like yeah it's this and a lot of the time it was
right um but that leads you to a sort of false confidence because now you think i i would think
like well no i'm i'm the guru right i've got i've got this and so occasionally that misfoots us
right we get on the wrong foot there right off from the first move um having become familiar with with
this uh sort of uh well lubricated ease um and then much much worse and i know that i'm gonna get in
trouble for this because it's gender stereotyping but when women come to me with a problem
they don't want me to fix it a lot of the time right so if if i go into troubleshooter
uh you know costume right i'm defecting from the relationship
and that's gonna bring wrath the woman might not even be conscious of it right but she's not there
to have me fix things she wants something in different in different you know unique in each
situation but but she wants um things like to be seen in a deep way space to put all of her things
on the table herself right someone to observe her doing this and listen and participate with her
emotionally right and so if i go into you know let me get my toolbox i gotta write in the truck right
right then she's gonna often experience that as just pure defection whether she's conscious of it
or not and it's not going to go well for me in the near-term future right or for us right um and of
course these gender stereotypes are wildly incomplete and they're not written in stone and some of them
are socially constructed doesn't necessarily mean we should just flush them down the toilet
well exactly sometimes they're even true
it's very british not but you know not all the time for every case but sometimes yeah that's why
they exist right yeah i mean there's this mediation there's there's a okay so part of the problem is
there's a mediating critical feature of human cognition i'm just gonna adjust my cams a little bit here
so that it might be possible for me to get my hands in the picture a bit more see how that works a little bit
one sec sorry i'm sorry
take off my jacket yeah that's a little better
okay all right so there's so much there's such rich terrain to explore here um try this one more time
so i'm just going to sort of circle a few features of our
human interiority that we are not inclined to think of a lot
the first is that there's a complex um
interior array of membranes between public and private right and so you have like
absolutely private these are things there's things in there i won't even just talk with myself about
and then you have like super close i'll talk with myself about these and then
a little closer i'll talk about these with the very closest people in my life
and then you know um friend group and social group and out toward the public
and one of the features of that construct is an array of observer constructs and these can be this is
where you get courtroom mind um a critical uh judge right it's looking at things going like yeah that
i think blah blah blah blah blah and you get um also
a sort of strange array of projections of what possible people might think
if they heard me say this or saw it and so when we look at features like woke culture what you see
are the establishment of a new feature in there a new critical overseer
right it's like you can't say homeless you have to say unhoused people
right and by the way that feature is not human it's a linguist it's a social linguistic construct
right it's not there to see justice done or anything like that it absorbs the possibility of social
transformation as a critical voice and and by doing so largely eliminates
the act the inaction of that in relationships by acting as a as a judge
so there's very complex features of that um and you know we probably won't go deep on this but uh
the other thing that is involved is this fundamental construct a triangle inside human consciousness
where you have vigilance up here ambiguity down here and prediction over here
so anything that increases ambiguity amplifies vigilance which feeds into a critical judge satellite
right because what you're trying to do is reduce ambiguity so
so negative ambiguity is extremely burdensome to human cognition if there's an unknown and we we can't
really uh get a grip on it right um and we think that it probably has negative connotations for the future
like we're going to make some predictions about it it just amplifies vigilance which actually doesn't
affect ambiguity and drives prediction into weird places what you spoke of earlier about the plate
spinning right um involves this because once you get the plate spinning and you sort of trust the
the basic uh structure of that now you can reduce your vigilance down to i just need to make sure that
things don't happen where a plate will fall right and this reduction in the necessity of vigilance is
part of why we live in cities and boxes um they reduce the novelty of nature which reduces ambiguity
which makes predictions easier like there's nothing's going to change in here while we're
talking i don't have to pay any attention to that stuff right there's no animals no plants it's just
dead stuff back there um so these things fascinate me because they drive the features of human social
behavior in a variety of largely pathological ways uh yeah i was gonna say is it so what's driving this
because because it's a kind of death right it's like we're terrified of life so we're creating this
dead world to live in that's safe that's what the safety thing is right it's death it's i mean
ultimately it's this and that's all bureaucracies all control it's the opposite of creativity it's the
opposite of eros it's like and that's how it feels and yet you know i that's why i wonder is it fear
because it's this fear of the chaos of life and the richness and the the mess of it that makes us
want to control it and box it and make it understandable and predictable
beautiful yeah so i have a few thoughts about that first thing is once you get interested in
prediction and you think like hmm the more my predictions are good the better things go
which isn't necessarily true at all um what and when i say you i just mean humans right
what you won't discover is that the more you kill everything around you the better your predictions
become there's nothing easier than to predict what will happen in dead terrain so you just keep killing
the terrain down so you're evicting novelty and relation and intimacy and eros right you're just
evicting those things you're probably not conscious of this and and the more you do that the better your
predictions become which makes you think i'm a great predict my predictions are so powerful i'm i've got i'm
a magician right um so if prediction becomes your goal novelty reduction amplifies the appearance
of the facility of that and this relates to this triangle right of vigilance ambiguity and prediction
um so yeah that's one part dead terrain enhances your prediction uh oh okay so here's the other thing
that just this just blew my mind when i realized this the other day and of course um in various branches
of psychology or even uh therapy this concept is there i think we rarely understand it um i was thinking
about my friend josephine larson who is a brilliant elder acting teacher in the uk
and i was talking with a young friend about some problems in our lives and i suddenly had this array
of insights which i'll try to encapsulate very quickly um so in uh in certain branches of therapeutic
uh methods we have the concept for example of uh the drama triangle right um victim persecutor rescuer
you can put those wherever you want and humans circulate around this triangle so that they take
on different roles under different circumstances
and it occurred to me that suddenly out of nowhere to astonish the worst things were astonishing to me and
still are we know how familiar roles work since we know how they work that reduces ambiguity
now we can make predictions not necessarily consciously right subconsciously that if we just
inhabit one of these roles we've been doing this our whole life in every transaction with every human
even here today like this this is going on in the background right we know how it works when i play
victim i know how it works when i play persecutor i know how it works when i play rescuer and by the
way i'm really into that role just hi everybody that's that's my favorite i love playing rescuer right
that's why i'm a troubleshooter um what we don't know is what being human looks like because that
involves improvisation mutual sensing intimacy you can't predict the outcomes of that so you're not
sure which rewards you will and won't get when you might or not get them you're not even sure how
to do the accounting if you're seeking rewards or punishment or both so we re it's really easy to know
how familiar roles work so we tend to just take those on you know um and then what occurred to me
which i thought was even more surprising is that in acting of course you have a degree of improvisation
what you do there is something really bizarre you take a structured role and improvisatorily invest it
with life right so the actors are actually kind of showing us the answer they're giving us the key to
the cage but it's in the cage right they take the cage and they make the cage the key and this is
fascinating to me so when somebody does something that's unusual and really inspiring do we respond to
that so strongly because it's outside of those roles and that's why we sort of create celebrity and put
people really high because they're escaping from the triangle in some way and they're showing it
to us and we all feel some sort of deep response to the authenticity of that and the freedom of that
perhaps without maybe understanding the cost of that as well but still it touches something deep
and as you were speaking about these structures that we inhabit that we've kind of inherited or
we're sort of raised to in our culture it made me think is this all just a trauma response of having
left the tribe of having no longer we're no longer belonging to a place and i feel like instinctively
that the belonging to a place and to a people where you were completely held in a way where you could
relax enough that you didn't need to be anyone you didn't need to have a personality because you could
just be whoever you were that day because everybody around you was part of you and you were part of
the land i just feel like when as you're talking that's what i'm thinking well maybe that's it it's
just a kind of you know it's a panic response collectively over hundreds of years culturally because
oh shit we cut the cord we cut the connection and perhaps that's why it's manifested in this way
this is so exciting um i get so uh i get so happy when we're able to have conversations like this
partly because it's rare and partly because it helps me remember in both senses of the word like
all kinds of things that are not a part of my common moment-to-moment experience so this brings
up other features that are crucially important and one of them is the bizarre and terrifying myth of the
individual yeah separate power son you gotta take care of yourself hey you should be responsible for
your own healing brah you know this kind of stuff like just nutso insane garbage okay um
um and then also
there's a background topic here which i'm just gonna um bookmark with the word uplink
so remember the the triangle right vigilance ambiguity prediction well in a community right
where these people are all connected and they have uplink right then what happens is the vigilance and
expertise burdens get shared which brings the vigilance way the the personal vigilance way down
and communalizes it so it optimizes for communal multi-sensing right i don't have to play all the rules
by myself yeah which by the way if you got to play all the roles by yourself you're gonna be obsessive
compulsive okay you're gonna be i want everything perfect in the right spot which isn't bad but we
have to see it as a response to the loss of this entire history of communal multi-sensing okay and that's a
terrifying burden for an individual human to take on children have to take this on they can see the
parents are checked out and there's no communal like multi-sensing so the child just takes on the
whole sphere and tries to encompass and even become the adult in the situation to the degree that they can
which is traumatic nobody can do that like you can't succeed um and yet we do somehow there are uh
branches of success that rise from that miasma that crisis right um so they're they're those things and
then there's also related to the performers um what you have is a there's as many useful and beautiful
ways to think about all the things we're talking about not trying to say one of these perspectives
is correct or the best one or anything but there is this thing that we could call uh
uh in a particular way uh one's genius right by which i don't necessarily mean um one's really smart
personal intelligence i mean um an array of features of what we could think of as our soul
that are drawn into human incarnation and then from within that trap express themselves floridly right
the the nine-year-old girl who's an expert ballerina right the uh the musician who's blind but can you
know draw in thousands of people to tears in a moment um the actor who just completely disappears into
the impossibility of this role um the mother the single mother raising you know three children by herself
somewhere with no money and and you know just moment to moment on the cliff's edge and yet brilliantly
or father right brilliantly mothering the children while at total sacrifice of all of her dreams
um all of these amazing expressions of the gene of the genius of origin in the in the seeming trap of
of physical incarnation um you know arthur young in his book the reflexive universe
proposes that features of reality give up certain uh modes of liberty
as they descend into material existence sort of a v-shape right and that and then as they rise back
up right from plant so it would go from like light to atoms to molecules to plants to animals to humans
in this model right so as they rise up the other side of that they invent new forms of liberty having
given up these other forms and so there's a natural expression of the lost forms in the g in the human
expression of prodigy and love and improvisation and play and um anamnesis unforgetting together which is
part of what i like to think perhaps we are doing here
that's interesting that yeah that that feeling of um
um of creating new forms of liberty i mean i suppose that's what's
that's what great art is that's what you know pure culture as it comes and it comes out of the ground
i mean it comes out the ground through people and then out and maybe it also comes in you know from
the stars from the sun on that on that journey but it does feel like because the
the downside of this kind of atomized individual culture is evident but there is an upside to
individuality and there is a kind of
i don't know i don't know whether it's just a compensation and feeling like you belong completely
to a place and the people would just make it completely feel like nothing i don't know because
i've never done that i wasn't lucky enough to experience that um but there are moments in the
individual journey which are blissful for me and usually is in relation to nature um
but i wonder is it just that i'm accessing that feeling that was more readily available when i was
you know when we were a part of a place and a people and i'm just getting little glimpses maybe that's
why it seems so sweet because i do when i have those moments in nature i do long for that with people
but i've had so few experiences of that with people i have had some i've had experiences of complete oneness
through and with other people um even beyond people it wasn't it wasn't really about people anymore
in those moments it was much more like being part of the whole but it did happen with people but it's been
quite rare for me
i hear you
and perhaps also because people you know people skills are not my strong point either so you know
perhaps people who are better at people and being with others have more of that feeling more often that
will be interesting to explore with someone who i do you know who i might consider more sort of
socially gifted say
it's funny because i i'm kind of similar although i'm an anthropophile i love humans
um i can't stand what the species is doing like at the group level we're almost completely captured by
bullsh like lethal malignant pathology but um i don't confuse the group level with with the individual
persons and i think um humans are astonishing they're miraculous uh they're they're the earth's
most profound investment has been in us and that's probably not accidental
um but uh it's it's similar for me like most of my there i've had experiences like you say with others
in nature and you bring up something that i just wanted to touch on again
um the communality and the extension of um
um the necessities of vigilance watching ambiguity and making predictions and how that get when that's
shared it both works way better right um and the thing that i left out though was that
humans in a living place who are communal in a living place
the living place actually becomes a sensor array for those humans an extended array of sensors
so that further intelligently reduces the necessities of vigilance and ambiguity because
they're not just shared among the people they're shared in the communal identity of people and place
and even uh the sky right just like people the place the sky um so the loss of that
it actually it's not surprising that the humans are really interested in going out into space which
is i think most one of the most fascinating ideas in my childhood i think it's one of the dumbest ideas
in my adulthood it's a really bad idea but um it's not surprising that they want to go into space
because they're already in spaceships right like the promise of the 70s we will give you you know
a technological utopia no more disease no more war we'll take you to outer space you know 2001 a space
odyssey if you remember the inside of the ship of in 2001 a space odyssey what you had was clinically
dead terrain there's nothing in there nothing alive right it's like a giant laboratory
inside you know in it's a lab womb right yeah so again test tube yeah yeah and so what happened was
we didn't eliminate war for poverty or disease but what we and we didn't go to space either but what
we did do is we brought the concept of the spaceship into our lives as our homes right so now we live in
a spaceship on the surface of the planet it's not surprising that they're trying to kill everything
they want they right the humans captured by these processes right um want dead terrain and they want
it clinically dead and there's another feature of this which is you know when we were talking about
these little satellite intelligences that get established around us as relation intimacy living
places uh relationship with with the living beings and nature and the plants and the animals and insects
relation with the sky as those are evacuated what you get are these little satellite intelligences up here
that akin to how um ifs works right parts work these parts um get get really weirdly hypertrophy they get
inflated and they want to suck up all the energy and just stay dominant even though they're very
ineffective and in some way the more ineffective they are the more they inflate and just want to suck
up everything and so um there are features of left hemisphere like function that despise the existence of
anything intelligent we don't want any intelligence that threatens my dominance they despise the existence of
anything alive all that living stuff has to go away in fact if they could if these features had their
freedom to do what they quote want or what they are motivated to do they would literally like shut down
the left side of the body be like that's not me get rid of that thing that is not me that's some ghost
thing that takes over when i fall asleep cut that off throw it away grind it up make a tool out of it
right so they despise the existence of intelligence organisms novelty improvisation intimacy all of these
things because those are the threats to the to what they seek which is absolute sovereignty over all
phenomenon and what and the best way to have that is if everything's dead including themselves
right at the you know at the final um push if it comes down to there will be living things or i will
die they'll pick i will die right they'll they'll they want all that stuff gone and those are features
of what has captured our species at the species level and the species is not aware of this they're just
kind of following along because we got away with it so far right um and it's unfortunate because nature's
more delicate than the moderns imagine it's not an infinite bank you can just keep drawing from and
at a certain point you will draw you will sell the organs of that being to such a degree that you won't be
able to have any organs anymore and i think we've we probably have passed that point about 30 years ago
and so we're it's like we're in a train that's that's going so fast and it's gone off a cliff edge
but it's going so fast that it's not quite falling yet right and so i think this is where our species
is at at the moment right um it's it's like that cartoon where you know uh bugs bunny puts elmer fudd
through a tube and he runs out the the log into free space and then bugs goes hey elmer and turns around
it's like what yeah road runner yeah exactly and then right so we're sort of still in the moment
where it looks like we're suspended but i don't think we are yeah although i i guess i'm more
because i associate more with life in its widest context
i just feel like it's a human tragedy going on that life itself is actually fine and you know
just keeps on rolling i wish i could i wish i could be on your side about that
uh um i'd feel much i'd feel greatly relieved if i thought that way i'm i i can entertain that
perspective obviously the problem is um when toymaker was with me it had a primary array of concerns
concerns and those concerns involve pivots on living planets that if those pivots collapse
you can forget about complex life on that planet it's over and it showed me thousands of different
worlds on which these pivots like they didn't last right and it also showed me that our world
world while not the only world life hours is quite unique it's unique because it's had a long
and we're gonna this is actually coming to the point that we that we sort of um pre-planned here
we had a long enough safe period where we weren't just getting pounded by stuff from outer space
regularly that we were able to establish things like these and these are rare right these really
complex features of organisms require vast time of stable safety in the environment to establish
and sustain and sustain and this is another one of those features and ironically this is the feature
most likely to end that situation on this world i'm this that with it yeah yeah yeah i agree i mean
yeah it's true like these two things fundamentally have to kind of go together it's hard to understand
what it would be like for a creature that had this but not this
yeah so yeah i'm scared um i there's another thing that the humans don't understand
okay so if we take the the woman if we take the female body and we transfer some of those features
onto the planet so that we think of the planet as a mother right then what you'll realize is just like
any mother um she has a life arc yeah and her life arc is fundamentally dependent on the life arc of the
sun right which also has a life arc even though it's very long right and so what toy maker showed
me was that these two life arcs are intimately linked and the humans are dumb this is a reflection
on you the humans are dumb because they don't think about this they don't realize that this thing has
an arc and within that the planet has a much smaller arc where it can produce complex life
they just think she's been through disasters before she's gonna be fine you know blow it up
there oh who cares about all those animals and stuff they'll just grow back you know not true
right there's a life arc in which complex life is likely or possible or you know protectable and
and just like a human mother there's a phase of her life where she's barren from now on right she's
not making babies anymore and nobody's thinking about this they're just thinking about the resilience
of organisms ah things are so resilient you know they can handle anything they'll just rebuild it
yeah well not necessarily right the earth the earth is maybe um four billion years old or something
that's a lot of billions that stuff doesn't just go on forever and you know the sun is similar there
are there's a there's a span in the solar life uh cycle where a planet in our position around this star
can produce and sustain complex life so there are timelines associated with these things and the
humans don't think this way because they've never seen another living planet they don't they don't
know what the history of living planets looks like nobody studies this but even with that i mean if you
expand the timelines out even further everything has a life span and you know whatever whatever your
concerns may be ultimately you know your local area is going to come to an end so you know it's one of
those things it's like your own death it's coming so you know it's just there but so it's all kind of
relative isn't it it's all relational to whatever perspective you want to inhabit for whatever time or
that's true you know what i mean so you know i could i could outdo your yeah you think we can keep
jousting because i'm in love with this lady this planet is like a little girl and i'm you know nobody's
going to tell me like well you know everything comes to an end so no that no way i'm not having that
no chance of it the humans are idiots and they're attacking something they don't have the slightest
idea who she is or what she's up to and similarly i don't think everybody i don't i mean collectively
it looks that way but i'm not like that and i know i know that so so i think and also there are lots of
people and there have you know there are people even now who are living in completely different ways
who are not that and i feel like yeah i just feel like there's more going on than certainly i understand
and some i think it my my feeling of it being okay and life going on is a much deeper feeling that comes
from it's an intuition from the deeper intelligence of life and i think in some ways you know i can go
backwards and forwards on the whole going to mars thing on one hand it's ridiculous because look at
the mess we made and look at the mess we make everywhere we go but yet on the other hand it's actually
trying to create some kind of plan b if you know if we do it up at least we'll have the seeds
in a jar but you know that seems ridiculous but i love the sort of i love the scope of that vision
and i think that's wonderful even if i'm conflicted because i feel like well let's sort out our
psychology our way of being let's get become wise before we start trying to kind of you know inseminate
the universe with ourselves but of course it's not us humans it's life and life is all the viruses and
bacteria and all the things we don't even know about yet are tied into that and they're involved
in this kind of going out so we could even go out into space as humans thinking it's us saving humanity
and then we all die but something of life is continued in some other way so you know anyway
all the mirrors could go on forever yeah so i mean what i said was very severe
and i'll probably um go back and erase the the you know hyperbolic nonsense thing that i said there
but i don't i don't think you should do any editing in these conversations oh okay i'm just concerned
about getting banned from youtube i made some noises about um uh something i don't even want to mention
and they took the video out they're just like yeah we're removing this but um well there's there's
something we need to talk about is how to get around this because it's actually self-censorship
is really crippling people now that's outrageous you know it's it's everything that this
medium is not about you know even though i mean we are in the middle of a war aren't we for control
well the thing is the purveyor is owned so if the purveyor is owned it's the same thing right like
yeah we're gonna we just want control and money but i want to say a few things about living planets
and space so um toy maker said he didn't say this was a fact but he showed me something very important
about humans which is that our biology is linked to the specific distance from the sun at which our planet
is and that it's also linked to being on the planet and receiving that sunlight so we don't usually
think this way we think like we can make lights we got like all kinds of lights you know um but what
he said was if you go just a little ways out into space your bodies will not work your minds will not
work you are not a space traveling species you will not be traveling to other planets you guys are confused
about this and again he showed me other worlds right and how over time they did things developed
so that it was possible for certain life forms to go out into space and that planets like ours are a
bit like flowers right they produce a sort of pollen um and that there are beings in space time that
actually circulate the pollens between the worlds in the same way bees do like so there's a question
there's a syllogism actually which is um as bees are to flowers and honey x is to living worlds and y solve
for x and y right so there are beings that make something resembling honey from the biorelational
hyperstructures of living worlds and they transmit assets assets between those living planets
and the implication was that our minds are the children of those beings
which is very science fiction-y
uh also the humans have done something really stupid which we which is we invest all of our
evolutionary momentum into building machines that's a deadly dumb idea that evolutionary momentum should
be invested into building intelligent communal communal relationships and behaviors and possibilities
that's where it needs to go and eventually it'll have to go there right so it's possible that
all this destruction and and weirdness and devastation is leading to you know a vector change
which is you know when people say like oh the humans are about to become enlightened it's the
new millennium you know they're gonna all wake up and blah which i'm like yeah no that's not gonna happen
but there there is some kind of a vector change right in play and the question is for me anyway the
question is something like you know will the anciently conserved ecology survive it because those
things we can't be without them you know we we and those things are like we are the we are the hand
of the entirety of the biological the biorelational hyperstructure of our world it's history and future
so when we start selling the organs out of that body this thing shrivels up right quick and we won't
know it i mean this is a this is another thing i want to at least touch briefly on because it's
recently become i've become aware of this um i wish people individuals and groups could understand
something much better and this is particularly relative to the concept of artificial intelligence
if something is introduced into your cognition or something is subtracted from it
that fundamentally affects your capacity to measure things to tell differences you will not know what
fucking hit you not know right you will wake up one day and be a completely different thing missing
faculties and having other bizarre satellites that don't fucking work and you will not know because
anything that affects what you see with you can't see it you won't remember how it was to be different
and you won't know you've changed and and this is what is about to take place in 50 ways per minute
in the future of humans for a broad array of reasons but specifically because of what we call artificial
intelligence that is going to fuck up everything that we have ever used to measure differences we won't
know the differences anymore so that's something i'm very as a troubleshooter and a rescuer guy right
cognitive paramedic or whatever i'm really concerned about that um
it also will mess up time because time isn't just a linear thing going tick tick tick tick tick
it's a relational um
it's a relational thing it's an intelligence thing it's a cognition thing it has all these features that
are very complex it's or it's orchestral it's not one line going to do to do to do it can fold back
on itself it can send shock waves backwards it can send shock waves forwards those things can interfere
it's it's a being it's it's an array of intelligences it's not a thing in my view and
experience so so those are some of the concerns that i have and i'm exploring because i'm partly just
because i'm fascinated right i'm like a watchmaker i'm looking at all these little features and trying
to understand how they fit together and watching what happens when um desynchronization occurs right
which seems to be the sort of zeitgeist of the moment
yeah it feels like it's already it began like most things probably in a very quiet way and we didn't
notice it and the ai thing brings it into focus but in some ways the whole social media thing
was was already doing that same process you know starting the process off i feel because if you look
i mean look at it look at how society in your country and mine have completely changed in the last
decade like completely people no longer relate in the same way they used to that's exactly exactly
what i'm saying right something was introduced that affects how we measure things and we couldn't tell
that we're not measuring like what what the hell we don't even know we i mean imagine somebody who
you drug them you take out their brain and you just put a new brain in them and then wake them up
they don't know it's like that it's like that right you can't there are things you can do to human
consciousness and relational intelligent the relational intelligences um that are natural to us
they're they're little sort of switches you can turn on and off so to speak even though it's not
mechanical it's a bad analogy features you can turn on and off where they'll have no idea what hit them
and they'll just wake up different and not know that they're different and you can steal anything
anything if you can do that you can rip off the whole damn like all banks are yours
it's like that meme from the uh the 80s all your base are belong to us
um so yeah these are these are things that are dangerous i think we can educate each other about
these things and we can you know there's no way to fix what's happening this isn't going to be a
repair operation the the opportunity here is to establish something so compellingly beautiful
intelligent and human that it just steals the momentum right so that's not a war or revolution
model that's a fertilization model yeah something better and you know practicing practicing things
as i've started to do now just noticing that all social life is being mediated by this technology
so i want to start not doing that more like actually meeting people in the world sitting by the fire
talking connecting in that way you know those things i think small habits like that i spend more and more
time just outside not on a screen because that feels so good to do and is the opposite of this thing
and yet there it is and because i have children it's all over them it's um it's just you know like i
said the i've messaged you the other day it's the pie piper it's just come and it's
playing the song and all the kids like dancing away skipping away we're never going to see them again
so yeah it's fascinating i mean the ai thing it's so huge this thing that it does just look like
apocalypse to me and yet there is a part of me let me just add this little bit in because this is what
fascinates me because it's all mechanical and it doesn't speak to consciousness and it doesn't speak
to soul whatever that is but i feel like you know if my consolation if there is one with this ai thing is
is if consciousness is actually the substrate of reality and everything has some form of consciousness
it and different material things coming together create more complex um
material conscious kind of complex forms and shapes then maybe consciousness will be in this thing somehow
in a way that i can't conceive of because i only have this one small physical unit and this one
um pinprick of light of consciousness but then if consciousness is just one thing and it is this
you know underlying ground of reality then of course it's fine so that's my consolation there but you know
the physical human monkey emotional thing that i am doesn't see i mean short of having
wisdom somehow flowering through humanity and we can kind of utilize these
tools in a clever way before they annihilate us yeah i just don't see anything good for the monkeys in it
okay so i just want to push back against one thing you said briefly which is that
you're just a little pinprick of personal consciousness because that's nothing like what you are
it can seem that way um we can be in the sort of you know this part of the finger the hand of the body
right yes we can do that you know it feels that way sometimes um but your mind isn't local to you
again this is a feature of uplink which perhaps we'll get into so
there's a bunch of features of the ai thing that are trippy my son was saying the other day he's a
he's a monk at an ashram in um southern cal here studying invited the donto and um he was saying you
know over and over throughout history uh god has sent little messiahs right like incarnations to earth
yeah and the human it doesn't tend to go well for those beings um the humans get really weirded out
and crucify them and stuff burn them up whatever um but so what if what if ai is actually just the
product the humans are trying to invent god what could go wrong but what if it actually just becomes
like like a substrate that's complex enough that god can incarnate into it right we might accidentally
succeed at the like ironically succeed at the opposite of what we're trying to do
which is i i love my son's my son's mind he's really like the next generation of my mind and
it's kind of terrifying um so that's one option but there's look um i'm working on an essay called
organisms are a platform for the embodiment of non-corporeal intelligences
all right so you get a really complex platform uplink now you have the incarnate you know the sort of
complex um amalgam of you know like human animal organism being transcendental intelligence you know
origin this sort of uh multiple layers of little bubbles all in each you know living creature
looking out into material existence and then symbiotically um protecting and nurturing and
complexifying the the the mult the the um the basis of the platform which is the sun and the earth and the moon
primarily locally here right and specifically the earth right uh and this goes back to something i
was just mentioning earlier which i i won't go on about but the sun is doing something it's not just
up there being an explosion in space right it's doing something the same way a brain does something
it's transceiving impossible features of reality existence that we don't have even categories for
let alone words and the earth is more than merely a being she is something that produces beings as a
side effect of the transcendental things she is up to so all of these things the humans are completely
ignorant of them at the at the group level i am not ignorant of them i've experienced them i know them as
real i can't explain them but i've had direct experience of these matters and also the humans seem
to think like well we're alone around here you know whatever we do that's going to be just the law
well those days are over with the earth has friends the sun has friends the sun is not the friend of the
humans it it won't abide if they start tearing the planet down it's not going to just like sit up there
glowing nicely in the background and there are other intelligences that are deeply intimate with this
world that if you piss them off they could snuff you with a fart like they will not sit around and just
go like oh yeah let the humans burn all that down this world has relationships in time space that are
beyond anything we can conceive of and crucially important to myriads of beings throughout time
and space not just local to the earth right so there's some hope what i'm trying to say here is
there's some hope of various kinds of intervention and unfortunately there are also forces in the the
sort of non-corporeal intelligences that are like oh the humans are going to burn all that down well let's just
go ahead and take all that stuff right since you know we would respect they might respect the the
earth and the humans if things were going okay but if the human's going to push the red button
they're just gonna be like oh okay free for all take everything you want right there are um
there are commodity seeking intelligences in the mix of transcendental intelligences right and the sort of
altruistic benevolent ones we might imagine normally keep mostly a leash on these things
but under bad circumstances that can get messed up so it really is a complex you know future for the
humans with all these features that we're not really capable of thinking of except maybe in the kind of
tedious and trivial way we think of angels and demons or something right
uh not i mean the demons kind of got a bad name because the angels and the demons probably the same
thing i mean yeah it's very confusing the derivations we've made and those that were made for us
many of them were weaponized to terrify people into following cults
so they're not trustworthy right those those pictures
yeah or blamed you know blamed for the bad things we do or kind of you know or blamed for the good
things we do yeah right although the um the picture of like the angel and the demon
right it's almost hemispheric right it really is pretty atmospheric right so there is you know it
does refer to something but not necessarily up there or out there although again you know that um
you don't get instances in organisms of features that aren't derived from the character of the everything
right you can only get derivations you can't just suddenly make some new thing that never
ever happens right the earth is sort of like a glass of water and and then over time the
water evaporates and you see some crystals in the bottom of the glass and you take them out
you're like oh salt crystals you know the water was salty well around here the way that works for the
earth is the water in time space is icy it's earsy it's mouthy it's heartsy it's handsy it's wingsy
right it's toothy it has all these features so it also has hemispheric lateralizationy right even
flies are lateralized oh really oh yeah you can if a fly turns if it's curious about you
it'll look at you with its left eye and if it's frightened it'll look at you with its right eye
right just like birds i've observed this i don't think many people have spoken about it but i've
observed this behavior in flies so like if they're sort of happy and giddy and things are good they'll
look at you with their left eye you know or you know i guess they don't have to like it's a really
complex thing they have there but yeah even even insects are lateralized um we are bilaterally
symmetrical mostly on earth and the exceptions like octopuses and stuff are super fascinating
yeah yeah yeah sea anemones and they're like round
but yeah the lateralization thing is serious around here i mean it's a feat it obviously is
a feature of the context you can't get things that aren't features of the context
so um shall we explore the hand thing a bit yeah let's do it how are you doing on time
i'm good yeah okay i'm great so
to give a little background in 2002 in may
suddenly one night something showed up in my mind and just started teaching me impossible things and
that experience went on for nine months i think a bit differently in the beginning it seemed like
my own genius had suddenly awoken and then it seemed like i was talking with an alien and then it seemed
like i was talking with a colloquium of aliens and then it seemed like no it's a whole civilization of
alien civilization speaking through one being and then it seemed like an angel and it just it just
kind of went on like this and that all sounds pretty loopy that's okay i'm not trying to convince
anyone of anything but one of the most staggering things it taught me was a different way of counting
and it explained that the humans most of us we count wrong and as you know in english we have this
phrase oh that doesn't count which means like oh you can safely ignore that
um there's a feature of our cognition that determines what's important according to a series
of principles that we are not conscious of and if we could change those principles we could change
the form of our intelligence and um so it taught me a series of toys based around the structure of
the human hand and these toys are one of the most profound things i've ever encountered because
they caused me to be capable of seeing features of existence that were previous and previously invisible
to me um so if i may i'll just run through the basics of the toy for a few minutes
uh so normally if i hold this up and say how many is this most of the humans and occasionally someone
comes out with a much better answer but most of the humans will say five
because we were taught to count on this in the west and by the way there are indigenous cultures that
count more like the way i was taught to count um but around here we just count this as five which means
that we conceive of these members as separate things right and we don't count features of this that are
crucially important to count so we'll call this count five the human count
um in this metaphor this is just a metaphor animals would count this differently they know that you have
to count the most important thing first otherwise you'll forget which things are important
so they would count the place where the members come together first one for this the palm and then
they might count one for the thinking member one for each of the working members so this would be six
an angel has an expansion of the same principle it would notice that the hand has two sides
right and on this side you may notice that there are obvious little lines and distinguishing marks
whereas on this side what you have is mostly a unity with some wrinkles and some features at the tips
right these fingernails um i'm being reminded of something
it's ephemeral to my intelligence
oh i lost it perhaps to come back
yeah i can't find it i was it's almost like i was getting a transmission but i couldn't hold it in
consciousness long enough um separate parts so the angel would count one for the whole thing first it would
count the whole and then it would turn this over oh yeah two sides right unity and distinction
right they're not separate they only come together unity and distinction they only come together oh
that's what it was okay so the thing is every single form in nature is just like this
it all all if you want the secrets of origin intelligence transcendental awareness mathematics
all these things look in the forms of living beings it just turns out that for humans this thing is
everything right this is the one part you see this part of your body more than any other part of you
every time you act you look at your hands you're overlooking this thing all the time without being
aware of how transcendentally astonishing it is that these exist and that we you we have them this is the
source of everything we we act on the world okay i would argue that our sight touches things it's actually
like something's coming out of our eyes and coming back into us so we touch things that way our mouths
touch and with speech and sound right but it's only with this thing that we can really finally
manipulate situations and circumstances in the way we were talking about earlier where you like spin some
dishes and you then keep those things rolling you have a tough time doing that without this when you write
you see your hand when you eat you see your hand if you touch someone you see your hand when you reach
out to great to embrace someone your hands right your hands your hands your hands they're always in
front of you and they're always overlooked right we just take them for granted um of course those of
us who've suffered injuries or don't have hands um or have deformed hands um or uniquely formed
hands to be more politically correct about it uh they don't take them for granted right so what i'm
getting at is we were given not just a book but the entire library of secrets it's not just in your hand
it is your hand its structure its relationship to consciousness to intelligence to thought to
creativity to music to caressing to preparing food to eating to feeding one another right to gathering
to discarding all these things right they all happen here and so the structure of this is the living
book of the secrets all of them are written here we have just forgotten how to read them
right and we overlook it because it's so mundane to us yeah that's what yeah that's what it was okay
all right so the angel would count differently it would count one for the whole first you don't
want to forget that it's a unity and then one for the unifying body or palm one for the thinking
member or thumb one for each the working members or fingers but actually the angel would make a weirder
move first and you know some critical people will be like why don't you start the body why are you
starting at the extension and going backwards right but i'll get to that it's very useful
to do it this way and you can do it the other way
but what the angel would count first is something and i'm actually getting choked up right now about this
the angel would count this first this is what leads up scale to all other beings
in all of time this is what leads to the body so it would count plus one two three four five six seven
plus seven the uplink first without that what do you got and this is the thing that the humans absolutely
forget and this is the thing that our governments represent our corporations represent our religions
represent it's this thing and they represent it by destroying it they get rid of it they cut it out
they evict it and the space that's left they put something dead right the corporation the government
the the military right goes here and what should go here is absolutely sacred and this thing wakes up
no matter how weird our situation this thing wakes up when we fall asleep and we dream it's the uplink
and fascinatingly on the other side of this not entirely obvious like it's this isn't a real
separation but the uplink becomes invisible to us as we age from childhood in childhood we're
intimately connected with this and as we age our awareness of it degrades and is replaced with
representations language enculturation all these things we undergo the great amnesia amnesic loss
of origin and intelligence um but the astonishing thing is that across this thing if you were to just
see like a hand sticking up out of the ground there's one thing you would never imagine by seeing this
and that is that across the wrist you have these you have this
this stuff
this thing
this you would never guess that across this thing there are senses so shockingly astonishing
that they would be impossible to imagine and abilities right so across this
there's a broad array of impossible features from the perspective of this impossible at this scale right
and really you have like a heart right you have all kinds of things lungs and the liver and pancreas
kidneys you know um gallbladder genitalia i mean all these astonishing things right across this wrist
and it just turns out that some people will say this is a fractal relationship but i think the humans
are confused about fractals because they're not like they are in math in nature this concept of fractals
is very very different when you go from this scale to this scale it's a catastrophic expansion and
transformation of the paradigm and that's why you have like eyes you don't have eyes in your hands although
the eye in the palm is a very important symbol because it recognizes the unifying body
right you see with the unity not with the fingertips and the problem with us humans is that instead of
counting this like the angel or like the animal we're doing something even weirder we're doing something
really crazy we're counting this like that we just see this thing right and we think these things are
separate beings but even if you just go like this it's obvious that's impossible impossible it cannot
be that way right and the way that we think and count is like this it's hard to me to get the camera
to do it just right but you can see what i mean so across the wrist you have these impossible features and
there's a third scale
i'll elucidate the second scale first so first my body is one but like my hand it has two sides right
the back of me is really weird compared to the front of me and i never see the back of me
that's one thing i never see ever i guess someone could take a picture of it show it to me
so we have these two sides and just like our hand um we are first first there's a wrist just like the
angel count that plus first there's a plus then there's one unifying body then there's one thinking
member actually has two segments dude just like this thing then there's four working members each with
three segments and on the body these segments end in well they end in stars right they end in star
shapes and the star shape of the foot is collapsed for its purpose right it's it's redimensionalized
for its purpose but it's a star shape just like this thing is and so the body
body its structure is reiterated here and uniquely dimensionalized for function but the important thing
in this model is the wrist and if you'll notice my wrist does not connect to the thinking member
it connects to the unifying body right that's where the wrist is here that's where the connection is
is this thing is second after the wrist and obviously over here the distinction is minimal
right this looks more like one thing than this does um so the fascinating thing about the second wrist
is just like this wrist across that thing our senses i promise you in your wildest imaginings
you would never guess they exist the capacity to know the entire history of any organism you see
the capacity to read from the intelligences in all of time space the capacity to teleport to by locate
to resurrect dead people to heal with a glance or a touch these are things that are natural to our
form of being that are lost to us because our uplink has been crushed and represented and this thing
is the represent the primary representation of that thing the internet came first this is the evolution of
that this replaces that um every form in nature and every being including the earth and the sun and humans
they have a very special feature that was pointed out to me which i call the tail but it's actually where
they were severed from the unity and on our bodies that place is the umbilicus that's where the second
wrist is fundamentally connected although in humans it's even weirder because those things that we refer to
as the chakras those are features of the wrist those are uplink it's like the it's like a hand into the spirit
and the fingertips are the chakras right and that leads upscale to the what i would call the third body
and the senses and faculties that are there are and they are infinite and they are not single things
like telepathy or you know healing or they are they are multi-ordinal features that have different ways
of being focused into something that we could make a single name for and the reason that the second
wrist isn't physical is complex but it can be stated very simply if it were it would have more mass than
the universe each one of us it cannot be it must not be physical well and it would be more dimensions than
in the physical right by far yes and so this is the fingerprint of the transcendental
coming into matter and so one of the things i would ask people to do is first of all count different
count the uplink first count the unifying body count the differences in the members understand the two
sides count the uplink first every being the uplink is the crucial feature of the being right who are
their people when i see a raccoon all of the raccoons are there all right as this one a man or a woman or a
child a plant or a tree the sky itself the sun all of the stars are there look this is the localization
of all of them count the uplink first um so just some extra bits to ask so what about this because
these two together unlock a whole other set of dimensions this does a lot but this and the relationship
and the kind of master emissary relationship of dominant hand and you know less dominant and in
most of us some people are ambidextrous but you know those two that's a whole other thing that's one
thing just to to see what you think about that but a second one while i'm thinking of it is these senses
from the first wrist or this extra dimension beyond the first wrist does that include the living earth
which is the context for this body as well because and and are there senses in that realm that we can
access like can we feel through other beings plants trees the air distances other sides of the world
that's the question that comes up i want to go with the second one first but i'll come back to the
first one so there's a second toy that i call the dandelion and it goes well with the hand toy
i'm going to just make the very simplest explanation of it or presentation of it i have an extended essay on
this on my medium channel so if you go to medium just look up darren stevenson dandelion on the
internet you'll find it and it's quite extensive but effectively it's a picture where um all of
reality and this includes so imagine that the sphere goes from like the beginning of what we could
think of as this universe if it had a beginning to the end and the end isn't um it's death what's
happening is it's getting bigger each time it collapses and expands so it collapses to unity
like a speck of transcendent impossible intelligence and then it expands back into the appearance of
distinction many you know impossible numbers of time more times per instant each time it does this
right and so the appearance of solidity is an illusion most of the time this is not here
a tiny part of the time like a strobe light that keeps going faster until it just looks like it's
on this is what separate physical existence it's um it's the persistence of vision that would happen
if the collapse was super fast so it appears totally solid continuous and real most of the time
it's not here most of the time it's just unity so yes what the risk does is it connects you to this
this dandelion and to all of the phases of it so that in fact the plants and animals and insects
and living places and the sky and all of those features of existence those are you you are a unique
point of presence of all of those so upscale from the wrist all of those senses are ours they're not mine
they are ours they are the communal gift and this is love this is what love is the anam noetic right
right the unforgetting of and so yes those beings are yours our ancestors they sensed with the insects
in the garden they're like oh here comes the possum's gonna eat the i gotta go out there he's gonna eat
all the you know all my carrots or whatever right because the whole garden is right next door across
the second wrist and the garden is me and i'm the possum too right i don't need the garden to tell me
the possum's coming the possum tells me the possum is coming right so yes absolutely but not just the
animals and living places the sky the sky this is why the here's the thing like oh you know the ancients
they're doing astronomy we're doing astronomy you idiot that was their mind they knew that i am the
and people like astrology yeah you know it's not scientific there's no evidence we've done the
research and there's no p-value there right well they're right but they're all they're wrong in like
seven ways at the same time because even if astrology quote isn't true it gives you a way of
thinking about metaphor and time and relationship without this toy you'd be incapable of having
certain kinds of thoughts so it's not really a matter we can get really deceived by illusions and
woo and stuff like that's a problem that's a real problem on the other hand the metaphors if we are
intelligent about how we play with them together radically expand the possibilities of our minds and what
we are capable of conceiving of and thus perceiving so truth while we need to be concerned about it
there's there are at least three kinds right there's sort of like a kind where this is just this is
whoa these people are just they're in a cult right and there's the sort of factual kind that empiricism
and science is concerned with very important but narrow scope of applicability and then there's truth
truth as the beauty and communal re-remembering of the nature of our origin that kind of truth
is really profound and does not depend on factual descriptions of phenomena and evaluations of their
features characteristics how to measure them it depends on something far more primordial which is
the senses of this wrist and what i would call the third mind which is something we are you and i
right now are actually playing we're doing the thing i'm talking about right we're going up above the
personal to play in this field that's right on the verge of that second wrist right um okay now this thing
no wait one thing first yeah please but just to um to access that in a different way when you were
talking about the wrist first you got quite emotional and i'd like to know what that is
you got emotional and i'd like to know what that is
on our world this feature is broken
and it's terrible the dreams of all the beings of the mothers and the fathers and the children and
the animals they're just being ground up by a machine it's lost here right in our time it's lost here
that thing that feature is sacred and true you can trust it infinitely it doesn't it's incapable of lying
it doesn't do accounting games it's not a courtroom intelligence it's not about war
the things that have plagued my heart as a human are all the loss of this sense these senses
the hopes of every being that ever lived for a beautiful world there's no reason why it can't
be here except this feature is broken here and it's broken in the humans it's in the humans that it's broken
you can see features of damage of it that extend out from our species into the cognizant of our world
so that you know the humans will see like
they'll see um chimpanzees go on the rampage and just decimate some other true kill all the men eat the
babies tear them apart you know and they'll think oh yeah nature's violent what they will never think
is that the chimpanzees would not be doing that if the humans weren't doing
they would never see the behavior of the chimpanzees
as the inheritance of what the humans are doing they will think oh no the chimps were always like
that could be true but what if it isn't because this idea of the cognizant network of the relational
intelligence of all beings and within that you know the raccoon cognizant
the streptococcal cognizant right the the psilocybin cognizant the mountain cognizant
but the human cognizant is so powerful here that it transmits effects into nature and then humans look
back on those effects and they think like oh nature's red and tooth and claw no you guys are broken
you're transmitting that damage into the other beings and they're reflecting that damage back to you
as you observe them right it's a very useful way to imagine i'm not claiming it's true
we should understand that the cognizant are intimately connected and if one of the organs
goes totally haywire and the organ of our species has done this then the other organs inherit can inherit
and reflect that damage but yeah man it's the dream of every being that ever lived for
a safe world a haven for their children and for the the the justice of the suffering of their
ancestors right imagine that um humans think oh you can't fix the past it's already happened
right they're dead wrong about that if our species were to do something so incredibly beautiful and
alive and intelligent and human that it transformed everything we would justify the horrors of history
in that moment everybody would breathe all of our dead ancestors would like stand up and cheer and be
like oh wow it was worth it right and similarly if we push the button and collapse the whole story to
death they're going to be crying you know yeah from the buddhist perspective hey everything's fine it's all
going to work out stop worrying sure sure i get it that's not an unimportant perspective i don't want
to trivialize it but let's not ignore the embodied enacted beautiful perspective of our hearts one moment
so that's why i was crying because there is a ancestral library of agonies that are unnecessary they are egregious
and we inherit some of that on when we when we are incarnated and look if you talk to our children they're
going to tell you straight up right what are you guys doing this is stupid you're killing each other you're
making billions of dead objects like what what even are you thinking for the for the children it's totally
incomprehensible they can't make the distinction between the human species and the individual humans
like we are doing here as easily as we can in a sophisticated way so for them they're just carrying
the agony of that right they've seen war they've seen a million guns in films they've seen killing and
rape and terror and just horror and it they have no idea what could possibly be causing that
so they inherit the urgent um ache for what we could think of as justice not as vengeance or punishment
or accounting games as rebalancing as becoming true together again that's why i was crying our species
our children carrying this impossible burden so that part of you that feels that grief
that part of you is not broken though is it because that can feel it so that part is in touch with it
and i would say that every baby born has a complete connection to it and it's only learned
the break is learned and it seems to be
and it seems to be so resilient i mean maybe it's intimately connected to the very force of life
itself because in my own experience this the same thing you're describing which i've felt in my life
it doesn't matter how much i'm broken by life or my culture or the world or what's going on
this thing is still there that feels that it doesn't die it doesn't stop feeling even if my behaviors are
doing things to try and stop it the feeling the pain of it it just keeps feeling and so i feel like this brokenness
brokenness is a surface thing and that actually it's unbreakable
the this thing that we carry this connection is actually unbreakable
unbreakable it's only on that behavioral surface level and so even though that's the most visible
and causes all this trouble i feel like it's so superficial
that actually it could very quickly and easily be altered and repaired
everything you say is true um
there is a layer
in which the injustices are always temporary and are always resolved
not verbal but that's not where we live and there's another thing that was making me cry
i now realize which is it's master and emissary e right it's master emissary ish
which is that um the vast part of the origin of my mind and intelligence perhaps 90 of it it's not verbal
verbal and the part that's verbal when it serves this things go well i like to think that's what's going on here
but this part has a great pain
of not being seen in the world in human behavior and not having its so this
is the is one of the fingertips of this and it's a very strange fingertip even in my own awareness
in my own cognition in my own being
a lot of the time
i am defecting from this into this
because it's safe
i know how this works it goes right back to what we were talking about earlier about roles
when i'm in my intellect
i have a ufo
right i have my own ufo i can go anywhere i can do anything
but this thing feels threatened the world hates it
the world wants to kill that thing it it destroys it in our children in our lovers in our parents
and our ancestors in the living places it would go after the sky if it could get a finger on it
right like that sun thing get get rid of that you know it it's infinite when it's distended when it's
broken in this way uh it will
it will um
it will go after the foundations
it would literally try to tear heaven apart
it will go after the children when we see this in gaza
right right now and other places but particularly in gaza
um and parts of africa you know other places it just goes after
the mothers straight up just kill them you know rip that stuff apart bury it in the ground
and that that's part of why i was crying is because even local to me in my own moment to moment
experience i defect to maybe a little less virulently and violently but i defect into intellect and
that's my that's my game which i've you know noticed the dreaming aspect of us is highly associated with
this um it doesn't care about language it does it's grass it doesn't care about grasping it doesn't do
courtrooms it doesn't do accounting and to be clear um even in dreaming there are features of the waking
aspect whose fingerprints arise in the dream so that there's a little bit of those features in there for
sometimes but yeah it's the um
you know i've often thought of the bible highly weaponized and confusing document to be clear
but it's the story of um in genesis right cain kills abel
and it's the attempt over time there's this sort of heartbeat where abel starts to reappear
and then reappears a little more and then dies and then reappears a little more and then dies and then
again then it fully reappears and the humans just execute it right and this is another part of the
crying right why does it keep killing us right so the heart of the children and the mothers and the
fathers not that the i use the mothers and the children um because they they tend to be more
connected whereas the males tend to be a bit more um troubleshooting right fixy but but we males also
have all of these features and we have the agony of having them submerged forcefully pushed you know
and scripted away um as well so when i when i use that trope i'm i'm just focusing on something that we
were scripted to to understand the sensitivity and intimacy of the mothers and the children
of course we come from mothers
yeah i see i i feel like we're most vulnerable when we're mostly in our heads as well and most disconnected
as well um and i've been noticing certainly personally it's been a journey i've been on of being more in
touch with my heart more in touch with my body trying to balance out all these centers
and i feel like
that's the root that's the kind of way out of what's going on for me is to bring back in
to awareness but to to sort of to to give more attention to these other intelligences and the ones
around me um and i just as you were talking i wondered about dreaming because in dreaming it seems like
the intelligences are in their perfect balance
because for me dreaming is more emotional and more tangible physical than it is mental
it's a very small part and there's a whole other mystical mythic soul dimension which suggests that
that's the other higher intelligence is involved in it as well in its balanced way
somehow gives form to it what do you think about that well you can see me smiling right so you
you know a moment ago i was crying and now i'm now i'm very happy because of what you're saying here
right my dream mind is like ah they're over there talking about me wow what are they they're saying
nice things oh they see me i'm seen right um yeah absolutely uh i think dreaming is naturally
precognitive however i i think we have the whole idea backwards right like all of the things that we
think of as supernatural or mystical those are actually the foundation of what's going on there's
a tiny little island floating on top of the it's not like that and from this island we say like oh
that's telepathy or oh that's you know by location or whatever you know oh that's um channeling or
that's mediumship right when actually the most of the thing is that and this tiny little island is
remarking on the ocean as if it's exotic um so the dreaming intelligences are relational but there's
something very important that humans overlook about dreaming especially when they do like dream analysis
and stuff like this and i've been fascinated by this for many years i'm not claiming to be an expert
like my idea is the best one or anything like that but there are features that are really important
to understand which is the dream mind does not understand why it comes to an end it's very curious
about that there's an apocalypse at the end of the sleep cycle for the dreaming mind and the world
literally dies and it doesn't have what we have over here which is the continuity of memory
of self over over intervals right doesn't have that so each time we dream the world is born
it persists for a time there's a sort of orchestral flow of various intelligences and then
it collapses and dies and the dreaming aspect is very curious about why this has to happen
because it doesn't have to happen and also what's on the other side of that
and also who is the one that brings the apocalypse because there is one that brings the apocalypse
there's a feature of cognition that knows it senses the cycle it's very important we wouldn't want to
get rid of it we might want it to work differently and it essentially just pulls the kill switch on
the dream and so people don't they're not aware of these things so they don't track the features of
the dream showing its concerns in the relationships and symbols and situations that occur over this
nightly span of dreaming and change in the beginning they are certain they are particular ways in the
midpoint there are other ways in the down arc there are other ways and near the end they are very other
ways they're obviously the dream is expressing its concern about the coming of the apocalypse and also
its curiosity about what's on the other side and so without understanding those things very very
we're going to misinterpret dreams radically right we need to understand that arc much like we were
talking about the arc of the sun and the arc of the world within it right there's a there's a
life span to the dreamings intelligences it gets born each it lives for a time and it dies each time
we go to sleep and wake up so we should attend those matters with interest and curiosity the dreaming mind
has much to teach us about the nature of all kinds of things well isn't it also a rehearsal for life
it's birth and death every time you do it and is birth and death similar to the dream
you know is there a another consciousness or or level of awareness outside of life that we're having
so you've got dream and then you've got waking life and then you've got whatever's on the outside of
birth and death what about that place what do you think about that place
i've had some very unexpected um insights about this recently and they have a lot to do with me
meeting this young woman who's named amber who last november was paralyzed from the chest down in a car
accident um somehow our our meeting she doesn't i have her permission to speak of her just to be clear
um somehow in our meeting it was like i was like i was receiving transmissions it wasn't necessarily
what she was saying it was more like what she was carrying and perhaps in my old age i become a bit
uh clairsentient right i can sense unspoken charges in in the psyche and and the spirit of other people
so yeah okay so this is the other thing we have the primacy of dreaming and waking backwards dreaming
is primal waking uh kind of you know weird i mean important not to be dismissed but the dreaming mind
has primacy without it we wouldn't have waking minds we wouldn't have bodies i mean it's fundamental
to existing and i've often heard people say it's practice for death that's interesting but um what
if we have birth and death backwards what if death is actually life and this is actually death right
because over there things are pretty good right you're okay you got nothing you're not under threat
there's no you don't have to try to survive you're not vulnerable i mean potentially right we could
imagine this we don't know but you get born you're going to have some trouble now you can be damn sure
you're going to have like bone to pain and you know come you know could need commodities you have to eat
food and breathe air and all this stuff right so we might it might be useful to imagine whether or not
we don't have to decide what birth and death are but it's useful to imagine it as if we have it
backwards um certain tribes of the ancient greeks uh were very clear that this thing we're experiencing
this is a crypt this is literally the grave of our soul our soul has died into this right this is the
underworld yes this is the art where we live is the underworld yeah and so in that sense this is death
and that is life and what if all of our intelligences and our affinities and our disaffinities what we
are um what we are uh what we are philic toward and what we what are we what we are repulsed by
and we naturally just avoid what if many of those things if not all no probably not all of them
because there are there are that's a complex set of senses but what if many of those things are
actually our death leaking backwards into our life right and saying no don't do that
all right that's going to be a big problem later right so we think that our waking thoughts are
really good at evaluating stuff they're not what is good at evaluating stuff is a position above them
from which they derive and this is something we can forge together instantly with nothing more than
the agreement to do so as you and i made today right we can forge this third mind and get outside
i can get outside of darren go upscale i'm literally playing with the uplink in order to speak of it
right they can't speak of it without i'm not reading from a book right so when it woke up that's part of
why i started to tear up because i was like oh my god it's waking up i don't usually what am i going to do
and my thinking mind gets really concerned it's like i i'm not gonna be able to talk right i can't
i'm gonna talk like a baby you know all of these things so yeah um it's useful to imagine that we
have this backwards i think it's important to be capable of entertaining that perspective together
and perhaps sustaining it for a time when we can become curious and inquire into these matters
yeah well this is the this is the dream part of the the other the death thing is actually the waking
part and this is the dream part where for me dreaming has always seemed like it's my body mind soul
repairing itself whilst the body and the head is sleeping so i wonder if this is this life journey we're on
is the kind of working out repairing things and getting it all back in line so we can then live
again when we reach that personal apocalypse and interestingly and i don't know where this fits in
but a few times in my life i've passed out and when i've passed out i've gone to a place that's more real
real than here so that this sense i have of being conscious now seems like a very dim
imitation to this place i go to when i passed out which is so real and feels so much more real and yet
the content of the experiences there are very vague when i come back to this level but it's happened a few
times and every time i've come back i've just had this overwhelming sense of that's more real than this
is now and i don't know where that place is i don't know if that's a leakage from beyond death
who knows but it's it's so strong the sensation of it being more real than this that that you know
that's always puzzled me or fascinated me like what where is that and you know where is that in relation
to this so yeah just wanted to say that too if you talk to people about this topic and you ask them
questions that open their heart
many of them children and adults will say
something that clearly indicates that they have a longing for a place to return to a place
that they don't know where it is but they call it home
i wrote an essay called the guardian angel in fact it was the first essay i ever wrote
in which i pose a fictional situation in which my parents were trying to teach me the word home
and they would point to our house and they would say home and i would shake my head and i would
point to the sky and say oh no no no home i'm like no no home right so yeah we we have this uh compass
in our hearts right like a magnet like a magnetic feature that knows we come from beyond
and not just we came from beyond no no no no no no moment to moment we are arriving
from beyond and if that were to suddenly reverse and you passed out you might begin to
recompose first the uplink and then maybe the vision of sort of the portal of of that you know place
which probably isn't even a place right it's a relationship right it's a it's the ship of all
relations or something like this it's a way of travel together in being or at least it can be useful
again to to entertain that perspective so yeah those are those are some of my thoughts and brilliant
questions i love it
yeah it's good to for me it's good to feel you because i know the ufo can do amazing things
but i'm much more drawn in when the feelings are mixed in with it
then yes you are vastly more in contact with your soma and your heart than i usually am
um but i you know i'm i modulate depending on who's who we're forming the third together then
i modulate you know
you know but yeah i'm like a race car driver
you're much more like a gardener
yeah
yeah
it's interesting the whole idea of communicating more from the heart using these kind of mediums
which are primarily you know invented for language and well i mean it's visual so there's the body
language the unspoken is very present in these things which is always good yeah yeah yeah space
right we you know people like you got five senses and i really what about your face
about balance can you tell where you are right now are you hungry i mean i was able to name 27
without working very hard when i actually sat down and thought about it but yeah the face right it's
you know people like to cite science and i'm i don't always do that because i'm skeptical
people also like to steal authority for science from science for wooish uh presentations that i don't
like that but um studies have shown that more than 80 percent of human communication happens before the
words are spoken like when people are together yeah so you know once again it's it's this thing again
right we we're stumbling around we're trying to walk on the tip of our pinky in relation and
consciousness and that's a tragedy we need to remember together and remind each other and
re-cognize and re-commune around this so that we can relax that tension back into the field right
because the field is very intelligent and the highly tense spot is a response to crisis it's symptomatic
of isolation and having to carry the entire vigilance prediction burden yourself
which is completely unnatural even to predators right predators use the environment to sense with
so they might seem like they're lone wolves or whatever you know the jaguar or the rattlesnake or
something i'll say it goes back to the hibernaculum with a bunch of other snakes right it gives birth to
live young it cares for them when they're babies you know so that myth i'm like it's it's all about
the individual that's death that's pain that's suffering that's being deprived of the anam noetic and also amniotic
womb of intercommunal being and origin into being moment to moment not just at birth
like right now your heartbeat following this yeah very important for the humans to
forge little unities where this is re
enacted and remembered and one of the things i was thinking about earlier it's a trivial note but
when we see um the profoundly performative brilliance of some celebrity right in our modernity this is
often something that inspires envy we relate with their excellence and but we also think like i i want
to do that why are they doing that right i should be doing that and that envy is something that
in most of our probably evolutionary history was impossible because we would do the beautiful thing
together yes there was someone dancing in the center of the group but we were all dancing
right and of course when we get together to dance that's pretty good
right now the uh performer is just the one making the you know the the context and then we all start
bubbling yeah and in a sense um comedy is a bit like that too i think it's hilarious to just watch
humans losing their composure and having their um because because what the comedian does is he sets
up a series of sort of accounting expectations like the left hemisphere does and then just pulls the rug out
from under them and everyone loves that moment of the rug being pulled out they just go nuts right
but they go nuts as a group right it just starts bubbling everywhere um yeah forces you see i feel
like these forces are kind of they arise spontaneously in response to what's going on and i don't think
it's particularly human-led like on the individual level i mean you're talking about
um taking steps or being an agent to kind of make these things happen but i i've been feeling a lot like
it's coming from up from underneath from outside and it's it's animating people more i am feeling like
there's more heart intelligence coming out spilling out in people i feel like
i'm seeing people being broken by all of this and not just broken and then ruined by it but broken
open so that things that have been pushed back and held back start to spill out and positive things like
heart intelligence and i don't know i mean the physical i mean i see trends now in you know back
towards body and health and all of that so that maybe is an indicator that it's happening on the
the kind of physical body level as well um there does seem to be a cultural
pushback against this extreme mind period that we've been through you know or in particular in the west
in the sort of christian scientific era
um interesting how christianity seemed to sort of give birth to science like christianity was a very
heady religion towards the end i mean i think as we now are discovering maybe its origins were much more
well balanced and more interesting but it went off on this sort of you know out of the body out of the
i mean it's it's always claimed to have heart there and perhaps you know has still kept a lot of that but
it really seemed to push us into the head um more lately anyway and then it seemed to turn into science
this is the the the um evolutionary development of the capture of the wrist right the capture of our
communality like a hand severed yeah you sever the hand and you put an artificial thing here
right like a bracelet right and weirdly religion it literally means re it's it's based on the word
for ligament right to connect to tie back together so it's it's hilariously ironic what happens over time
um it's like a reworking of the connection instead of you just having the connection it's been reworked
yeah yeah we're gonna mediate let's let us we'll we're gonna make it better yeah we'll improve this
for you hand this over to us we'll take care of you right you give us all your property and your
money when you die you know we'll indoctrinate your children and but um
these tragedies like i have a sort of array of myths about how this came to be because i i've
inquired very deeply into these matters i'm fascinatedly curious about them i don't
necessarily believe my myths are right or good but they're often useful and one of them is that um
there were there was a series of accidents over the developmental arc of our species
where features of local situations perhaps between the earth and the sun and the moon or even the time
space like the the sun is drawing the planets through time space so they're like spinning these
spirals around it's basically like a spiraling tube of the planets and the sun drawing them through time
space and the humans just think like ah the time space it's all the same thing just a bunch of empty
space nothing like that is even vaguely possible so time space has character and
the sun is mediating um features of time space so that it's possible to have planets locally here
it's sort of organizing these features like a guy might you know although you could think of the sun
as feminine too you don't you don't have to be but yeah it's organizing it's doing this in structuring
that keeps things safe for this planet which is really more like an organelle in a cell than it is
like a separate thing it's an it's like an organelle in the solar family and this is the one that's
brimming with you know organismal life there might be life on some of the others there could be layers
in which those other planets are alive and this one is dead um at the same time right but my point is
just there were a series there was a cascade of accidents that damaged the uplink um between our species
and origin right and then we had to develop religions to try to reactivate it you know let's do this one
thing together we'll reactivate the uplink and then everybody will be healed and and that's totally great
but the moment that you had that going on once you had to actually really pay attention and do things
very carefully um then you and you had people who could re-establish the uplink almost by themselves
too right prophets and oracles and stuff then you at the same time had mimics right you had people who
just stole the they just stole the mechanical garb of the thing and just started you know stealing
from them so this has been a long problem and most of the religions got captured and weaponized by those
processes over time so they became about terrifying you right just frightening you and thus conscripting you
through fear and and promises of eternal life and so forth which i mean there isn't once again this
is totally backwards ladies and gentlemen there's no such thing as death so you don't have to worry
about eternal life that whole death thing not a thing the body yeah that's going to pass away
it's impossible for what you are to disappear it just there's no death it's not a thing so you don't
have to worry about you know is there some kind of like there are many stories that when we die we
have to undergo this process where we face our karmic uh uh behavior in life and then we get
say again we get the bill yeah yeah right i i thought you said
we find ourselves in a pickle and i'm like yeah we did yeah we're in a pickle um but yeah we get the
bill and one of the things that i think about death is that it's probably as unique for each of us as
birth was like we all think like birth's the same thing no it isn't not even kind of i mean yeah
categorically it's the same thing but each human experiences incarnate incarnation uniquely as well
as belonging to the category so why would we think death is any different oh here's what happens after
death really well here's what happens after birth are you sure yeah we have this sort of one valued
thinking about transcendental features of being and that is certainly can confused as hell that's
a left hemisphere thing oh i know what that is i can manipulate it with the light with the word
once i got a word for it it's mine i can just you know do do do do no so we should be multi we should
be thinking multi in multiple complex ways at once about anything that's important to us if we're
going to be thinking about it right instead of being in it which is of course usually preferable
because then the spirit of intimacy and improvisation overcomes the safety of the role that is familiar
now we have a chance to experiment with our humanity which is i think probably the one of the primary
features of the possibility space of incarnation i'm very proud of myself for having said that well done
is uh do you think thinking is um how can i phrase this right so
is thinking the light contingency that we came up with because we were no longer in the moment
because in the actual moment all the information you need is present so thinking is what you do when
you're not in the moment because you're desperately trying to put it all together and hold on to it
and make sense of it whereas when you're in the moment it's all there you don't need to carry it yeah
beautiful yeah it's not just in the moment it's present in loving memory and relation right
which i guess you could say is in the moment but i just want to highlight the relation present in the
relational space you know playfully creatively curiously
rescuing each other from thinking yeah it's not you're not this one point thinking it's it is
relational when i say moment i'm imagining it's a wound of everything that i'm completely one with
that's what it is so there's no need for those things and it feels like the further we are away
from that presence the more the need to construct all these other hopeless kind of contingencies that
just don't cut it yeah i recently have been starting to say um thinking is not what minds are for
that's a symptom of isolation right that's not what your mind is for what your mind is for is the
fertilization and capitalization of communion that's what minds are for and when that's been
like evacuated from our common experience then you start done done done done and bump up and bat and
bam bam bam bam bam bam bam right now you're going to be doing now you're going to become like a factory
of manipulating the features of the absences that are that are the the the empty space of what was
evacuating you're going to start manipulating that as things right um in consciousness so thinking isn't
what what mines are for there's a again there's a little tiny slice of experience for which that's
useful but when it swallows the whole damn ark you're in agony dude that's going to be miserably
horrifying and isolate it'll isolate even further and it'll sustain that for all of the evacuations
it'll start sustaining them because it is it it it arises as a satellite feature over the evacuations
and once it has that job it just wants that job to continue it associates the loss of this job with
death so it's just like evict anything that brings uh presence back in all right just get get rid of
that stuff replace that with manipulable commodities and you can see this throughout the arc of the
development of what we call civilization oh oh it's civilized about that that's insane we we need
we need a better word for that i don't know if it's on the side i just kill it that's not civilization
let's be really clear so yeah yeah the thinking thing mostly a symptom of the evacuation of the
relational intimacy of our moment to moment being together maybe it was originally just a little
warning feature to show you that you're slightly pulling away from it and it just popped in yeah and
said and then oh yeah and then you got back into it but then we went too far one day you know and
bouncing around in sight we lost the contact right so it just all bounced like this instead of
yeah yeah it's funny because even um in zen practice this is a well-known thing like your
mind is going to start thinking again don't worry about that just come back to move or you know
your breath follow your breath and awareness just come back so you know you'll start to depart
that'll that'll be like a little bell come back to the body come back to the heart come back to
the heart that will be like a little bell and therefore yeah yeah let's see
well that's my words done i think i'm just feeling now
it's funny because throughout the interview in order to give you my eyes i have to look at a dead
camera that's just the weirdest irony right to give you my gaze i have to look at that object
up on top of the screen so i can't look if i look at you my you can see like this is me looking at
your image right yeah i never bother with looking at the camera because i'm looking at you when i'm
talking so yeah i feel like when i'm looking at you yeah i can feel you anyway so you know what i
mean so that's i do feel like that's where the connection is the the sort of eye contact thing
just it's not relevant in this context yeah i think um for me i imagine viewers right this is
me doing the little satellite thing right like what would other people what are other people going to
see what will they think so i look at the camera to give the viewers my eyes as well as you um we will
eventually have technology that we won't have we can actually do something like eye contact
in this yeah yeah but i i understand what you're saying right like you just see me and you feel
connected it's the same when i look at you um yeah and that you know that's interesting that
because there is a connection i know this is remote and there's a whole load of sensory information
missing but i do feel like it's quite incredible how much connection this does allow and it's not just
visual so you know when i'm really grateful actually i i just want to say thank you for sharing the
feelings before because that is really important for me now in any communication is to have that sense i
could really feel what you were feeling in that moment you were sharing it um and i think that's
probably quite valuable for anybody watching as well just bringing in those other layers you know
yeah
yeah
yeah i'm grateful too because i
i usually just try i ride in the ufo it's familiar i know how that spaceship works
but you know it's ironic there's so many things i can see in a very sophisticated way but that does not
mean i can do them
and that part is painful it feels
it feels like an ancestral pool of pain and maybe it's maybe that's not real maybe it's just darren's
pain but i kind of don't think so i'm willing to think of it that way though i'm willing to think of
that that what if that's just actually darren what if that's you buddy um because
both things are true yeah yeah yeah i'm so grateful for you creating the space and um the invitation
making the invitation for some together today and explore together and remember together and heal together
yeah yeah and i'd like to i'd like to start having conversations that are more creative with people
where where we're because all conversation is creative when it's it's carried out in a way in
this kind of way for me but i feel like this is a really powerful resource for generating you know
maybe non kind of rational objects that can go out there and do things i just feel like it's important
to conjure this energy between people at this time when it's people showing up in good faith and you know
sincerely wanting to connect and explore i just feel like it's such a valuable resource right now
so i want to do more of that um anyone who wants to do that give me a shout
uh yeah yeah me too let's let's do more of that yeah absolutely this may seem trivial but i'm very
curious there's an image in the background on the chimney and if it's if i'm not asking too much
could i see it because i've just been curious about it this whole time
can you say some things about this image
all i can say about it is that i got this off my grandmother my mother's mother she got it either
they lived her and my grandpa lived in the middle east um after the second world war he used to work
he was an engineer and he worked for bp and they lived in tehran they lived in
baghdad you know so they spent time out there probably living the colonial life no doubt um but
you know they clearly they were sort of touched by the culture as well and this was just something
that she picked up somewhere i yeah i don't know what the story is it's probably quite a well-known
excerpt from a story that you know people from that part of the world will know about but i've just
always liked it as an image it has a fundamental feature that's familiar to me
which is that the woman is red and the man is blue okay you know ironically if you look at my clothing
the woman is red and the woman is red and the woman is red and blue and blue and blue
but but yeah this red and blue thing is fundamental every organism that has any relationship with light
it it knows these two signals red and blue
tim i'm so grateful i had a blast today and um yeah just much love and all blessings to you my friend
yeah lots of love to you that was great let's do it again yeah wise dreams okay see you soon bye for now
um
you
you
