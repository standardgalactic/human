hi darren hi dr kuyawa how are you i'm just i'm well i'm so excited to have some time to explore
together today thank you i just sent you an email saying that unfortunately i have only one hour
for for a conversation so just because of other commitments and other issues so i understand
um it's such a privilege just to have some time with you today and i'm so grateful
for your work and your brilliance your scholarship and um the heartfulness of the spirit
with which you approach uh this entire the historical and the the present beauty
of of the feminine and eros and um i've been steeping myself in your work for the past week
and what a what a series of amazing revelations um thank you i'm also very grateful that you provide
your work without advertising so that people can just see the whole thing and not be interrupted
that way and the gift of the wisdom and spirit that you bring to that and before we start i just want
to take a moment to honor your history your ancestors your mother your grandmothers and all of the women
who have struggled throughout you know the aeons to be seen and heard and to speak and to have something
resembling justice in the dialogue and and the incredible richness and power of the feminine voice
so thankful and grateful to all of those beings and to you for for bringing them back into
our moment to moment experience and our thought and our memory just really deeply honoring all of that
work yeah speaks thank you i really appreciate that
um so i have some notes and some questions but i'm i'm really curious what's on your mind these days
what have you been learning lately and what would you like to talk about today oh i can talk about
anything you want to talk about so i'm open this way so uh first of all so we are talking about the
other goddess which is the book that i sent you which talks about the goddesses of eros and secret
knowledge so just cover this and then we can move on because i think i wrote it for two reasons first
of all to honor my own experience that was different from the kind of prevailing narrative but also
realizing that i'm not alone that other women have the same experiences and that actually there's a
lineage of goddesses and women from the past that had this kind of experiences and they were silenced
and they were mostly silenced by mainstream religions and i'm not going here against mainstream
religions or any religions although i think that some of them served that purpose already but that's
my personal opinion it is that they allow only for one voice and one narrative and that when one voice
and one narrative is not necessarily the highest or or the most appropriate for current times and
i realize also that there are two things going on and i'm focusing i focus on errors especially
although i speak about secret knowledge associated with errors in the other goddess
but also on what i call goddess consciousness but it could also for those who are let's say christian
they could call it christ consciousness or universal consciousness and i will explain why so goddesses of
errors simply because i think that sexuality is really misunderstood and misused in our society
and in fact is this considered the sinful thing so to speak but from a religious point of view but the
reason why it is so it is because it is always portrayed especially in the entertainment and you know
the way we are brought up as something dark or something very animalistic when in fact there are always
esoteric traditions and there's nothing wrong with it you mean like dark is not good but you know it's
nothing wrong with a sexual impulse itself it's just how we use it but there are always esoteric traditions
on the margins of uh traditional religions that actually i have a different approach towards human
sexuality and they wanted to uplift it and they also said this is act sexuality can actually be a mean for
um expansion of consciousness and for the union with the divine because it is such a powerful thing
then i looked into these traditions in the other goddess uh i was looking to tantra because i was
initiated to esoteric hindu tradition and then and i studied with a translator of um classical tantric work
the kula ritual i think it's chapter 29 and which is a very enigmatic chapter so it really helps
studying it with a few sages so to understand it had my own experience in this area so it kind of
also uh proved to me that you know the teachings are correct although uh when we throw ourselves into
any sacred text in my opinion if you really approach the text whatever sacred text you want to find
guide us from with complete commitment and love and devotion the text starts to reveal itself to you
it's a very loving and sacred relationship so um and so i wanted to people to look at uh sexuality as
not something that uh is dark but something that can actually uplift us and it's really an attitude towards our
our own errors and sexuality that needs to change and i found the lineage of goddesses which go very
far in the western tradition coming from uh maybe even nimna but from sumer but also inanna and ishtar
and isis and i connected also marie magdalen which is at the center of my book of this tradition
so that would be the main i guess uh gist of the of the book however the other side of this it was the
secret knowledge which i'm also uh much more focused on in my book that i hope to finish soon but i have
academic commitments and other concerns you know i just write when i can but it should be probably
finished by may or june you know fingers crossed when i look into uh also um uaps you know because
i think that they're also especially after the work of diana pasuka and american cosmic and encounters
you know non-human intelligences she changed my way of thinking about it because she looked in her books
into how you know ufos she's looking at it as a professor of religion uh you know ufo becomes a
new religion but from my point of view it is also things that were considered uh spiritual some people
experience now as ufos or other uaps and i unidentified now it is called anomalous right right
uh phenomena so it's not even aerial it's anomalous so everything that is kind of unusual uh you know
we tend to write off and even if we have profound experiences we don't share them with others because
you know either they cannot comprehend it or we are uh you know afraid of uh shaming ourselves so i look
into my own and other people experiences that are anomalous and could be there and i also look into
something that is very dangerous because i dive into different forms of what i called goddess
consciousness and i look into artificial intelligence which i think is a very serious threat
not by itself but by the people who create it that are completely irresponsible and they create it from
a lowest level of our consciousness because they have no sense of spirituality and they have no sense of
what consciousness actually is and they confuse it with mathematic logic and calculations so i think
that it is actually very destructive to human soul and to human species so this is the work on which i
and i also look into mythology in my new book which explains what i called goddess consciousness that was
somehow lost so uh it may be kind of controversial but i think that the feminine has been so suppressed
that now even the feminine becomes toxic very often because we don't know how to assume a rightful place
so very often because of you know it turned into manipulative and so on you know so i acknowledge
the side of the feminine but in when we look into mythologies of goddesses asian mythologies of goddesses
not only western but also hindu which i look in my first book into in the other goddess it you know there
was this lineage of and stories of lost consciousness which is a different form of consciousness which is
somehow embodied by the goddess which is more holistic consciousness and and maybe deeper consciousness
because what i think we're experiencing nowadays and i'm not talking against masculine i love masculine
i love this uh uh interaction between masculine and the feminine but we took because of historical
events and however religions you know proceeded we develop the masculine form of awareness or consciousness
to maximum to the limit now and it it is now an peak moment which is very dangerous i believe
which is the one creation of ai because that is created from this kind of very logical practical form of mind
which helped us you know like uh some aspects of modern medicine although not all of them are good you
know with technology and so on uh but and now it culminates in this culminating this in in artificial
intelligence but it will lead to the destruction of our species literally unless we recover this other
form of consciousness which i say the the feminine consciousness that offers different point of view
and lots of mythologies asian mythologies actually talk about it you know about the descent of a goddess and
and and and that how the goddess was basically deceived and i see it more in terms of consciousness and we
really have to discover full consciousness of humanity including which is also hidden in this anomalous
phenomena in my opinion because it reveals itself in ways that our logical minds do not allow
wow okay just give me a second i'm gonna close my door
okay so it's first of all it's astonishing what what an incredible uh introduction that you've just given so
profound so packed with provocative and brilliant insight curiosity wonder um and so uh covalent with my own
concerns and even with the um the man i was interviewing just before you know i was almost late because i was
in another interview where where we were talking about um how sexuality has been deprived of its essential
divinity in our common experience and particularly under the the sort of ages of the monotheistic religions
right um which masculinize uh the divine and again it's not like one of the things that i love about
your work is you push against the problems without demonizing the other side right and that's very
important because there's something we can we can learn from the entire continuum of human religious
thought and experience and so if we if we otherize or demonize some particular thing that becomes uh
occlusive to our capacity for insight and understanding um i share so i i in my own life i became
fascinated with computers very young and i became a technician and a programmer and so forth and i was
absolutely i've been fascinated with artificial intelligence since 1981 okay yes a long time ago
and initially what i what i believed my my sort of um my motivation was i thought i want to know i want
to have contact with something truly intelligent and my species is not intelligent right especially at the
broad like group level we are the opposite of intelligent and so i thought what i wanted to
meet aliens right i read science fiction all my young life and i wanted to meet aliens because i knew that
somewhere in the universe there must be actually intelligent beings um i quickly within probably within
eight months um my perspective changed and i went from trying wanting to develop a mind inside a machine that
i could trust and that would be intelligent to understanding that uh nothing can outperform organisms
because organisms are so astonishingly brilliantly profoundly complex but nothing will ever you can't
get better than a tree right or a raccoon i love trees as well yeah so i so i'm sorry so i'm so
maybe i'll follow up so i don't forget this so i completely agree with everything you said and it's
absolutely important to look for this but i wouldn't i think it's actually missed a misnomer it shouldn't
be looking for intelligence looking for wisdom because intelligence is very often actually this kind of
intelligence that you know engineers have which are called masculine intelligence so and and this is a very
important intelligence and it's very important that we arrived at this point of our history and
it was necessary but now we have to switch gear you know this is what i'm saying i'm not saying that
it's a wrong place to be i'm just saying we just have to really look at it more responsibly and bring
other form of consciousness because when we look at the you know i want to commune with something
intelligent we assume it is sort of artificial you know it is this kind of mechanical intelligence
intelligence which is a uh you know um only one form of intelligence when wisdom is more holistic
wisdom is more holistic and this is what i call uh female intelligence and yes i do believe and you said
that we also other religions like i was brought up as a catholic and i actually although i lived left the
church not because of anything in specific but i didn't get any spiritual nourishment eventually because
so that's basically i was looking for you know connection like you did right right and and then
but i do appreciate that i was brought up as a catholic for example because uh at least i was
open up to two things uh spiritual is possible spiritual is real and the divine feminine although
it's not the divine feminine that i chose to explore like you know virgin mary and so on
i went into the side of mary magdalene and i explained it in my book but you know at least
i had i was taught that spirituality is real you know and then i just took it in a different direction
looking to different uh traditions and i truly believe in human spiritual evolution so yes on on large
we are not kind of intelligent or we are hopelessly stupid actually like let's live intelligence
and simply because we are not not dealing with our shadow we are not dealing with uh
dark side so to speak so um so we do not respect nature for example for me it is a big thing and
and artificial intelligence you know does not respect nature i'm not less even worried what's going
to happen to humanity but what you know it's nature has no use for robert yeah so and i think there's a
deep connection with nature and when i had a spiritual awakening and i meditated for decades now
you know i was imagining it very romantically that i'll have this fantastic insights and so on but
actually what happened i started to be connected with nature you know like i now have conversations
with trees and animals and you know i cannot help it because they speak to me not only not only that but
you know actually occasionally see things you know we're talking about anomalies right that actually
come from nature and quite possible that what is called ufos and so on are actually natural phenomena
so that's my thing i'm not saying that there are no other technologies from other planets but i'm
in the area of ufos i belong more to the school of jacques valet that i think it is an asian phenomena
that was always here for a very long time and it's probably multi-dimensional phenomena
phenomenon rather than just you know let's get the spaceship and get that technology there may be
some spaceship but i tell you something in my opinion if they have spaceships they are not very
developed they just have slightly higher higher technology but if you really developed you would
contact other species through the means of consciousness yes and i think this is what's actually happening right
so this is my next book about yeah yes brilliant absolutely beautiful it's um you may find it
surprising how profoundly um how our concerns and perhaps our experience fit together um my uh recent
roommate made jacques valet's website so i have like christmas cards from jacques in my kitchen
um and i'm very familiar with the work of dr pasulka yes and i've studied and been fascinated by ufos since
i was five years old right i read chariots of the gods when i was seven so these are concerns that have
been part of my own experience um for a very long time and we share i think a profound concern about the
dangers of human uh misuse of the greek concept of technique right yeah and i don't i want to
first of all i want to acknowledge what you've said about intelligence um and how you when when you hear
this word it is reminiscent of the dangers and the sort of rational logical uh engineering
aspect of human thought um you know i've i've sometimes said that if if a scientist today were
ethical they would never publish for the simple reason that everything they publish will get
weaponized right so if they were truly ethical they would demand the emergence of actually intelligent
societies right and i don't mean intelligent in the sense of technique i mean in one of the really
important features of intelligent human potential and behavior is to know what not to build right to
know what not to do you discover this i discover this in the um the lifestyle and mindset of many
indigenous peoples it wasn't necessarily what they did that made them human or wise or intelligent it was
what they refused to do in many cases right and and so there's nothing the humans are unbridled as a
species they're just completely unbridled and something is has sort of captured them in a sense i'm not
sure that it's i'm not sure that it's um like an evil thing it's almost the absence of the divine and the
absence of the feminine and the evacuation of the good and the true and the virtuous and this just
creates this urge to replicate structure and worship structure the sort of dead inside you know face of
our technologies in our cities and so forth um you know i've i've had a direct experience myself in 2002
of long-term moment-to-moment contact with a non-human intelligence and that experience was absolutely
staggeringly ecstatic terrifying and when i use the word intelligence what i mean is something resembling
non-human intelligence right that is not um bound and distorted and warped in the ways that the
intelligence among the sort of the group uh zeitgeist of our species is right so there there are
intelligences and nature is profusely uh evocative not evocative expressive in like embodying those
intelligences those originary intelligences um so just to be clear i would distinguish the human
i would usually distinguish the human misapplication of technique from intelligence intelligence would
would stop that from happening if we were truly intelligent in my sense although i'm happy to
use the word wisdom or consciousness whatever feels comfortable for you um as long as we clarify that
the term so to speak academically then yes because uh tech man yeah you you we can use tech now because
exactly this is what it is and it's right and then we have psyche and news right not just techni and
pneuma right with spirit or breath or the the inspiration um of the divine into human existence
and one of the things that i love about your work is its celebration of eros as as an orienting virtue
of that inspiration well thank you for this so yes actually i wrote about the nose and new my a little bit
but i actually at the moment i'm writing a chapter uh when i look at the deeper take a deeper view of
the gospel of mary magdalene which i studied now for 20 years not only as a scholar but also as a
spiritual seeker so now you know the connection of the text is much stronger because yes it speaks to me
so it turns into quite a long chapter when i and even today you know i will be writing about news
in the gospel of mary magdalene so because news is actually this element that allows us to perceive
what is normally perceived as anomalous by that kind of mechanical mind right yes because and for
example the gospel of mary magdalene which is the gnostic gospel is it talks about it as well so in fact
it's probably impossible to have a spiritual experience without being in touch with news
because it opens up our perspective so even if somebody lives on a very low level of consciousness
like this is material i just want to have stuff you know and that's fine that's part of the ambition
it's fine but if you stop there then unless somehow venus descends upon you which in in christianity
is called black grace you know and you cannot have any experiences so that's why i would argue that
once you have one experience then you have more experiences spiritually speaking or ufos or whichever
anomalous because then your mind opens up to the possibility of that when you do not allow for the
possibility of something you cannot see it it's that's why i think when people have ufo sightings for
example when there are ten people and let's say five people see it five people don't see it and
people say oh well i was there he's lying right well i'm sorry but you were not connected to the news
you know so it's almost like the dimension was there open up but you just couldn't perceive it
right so so that doesn't negate anybody's experience right on the contrary so this is news is this this
thing which you know it's also called the the hook of the soul that connects us to the eternity
so uh this is a very beautiful concept and it's not just a concept it's reality and i think we should
strive to actually open our minds up to this and hearts up or whatever because we're talking now in
biology you know but open up whatever you need to open up to to experience your own news because it
is like a methodology to connect with the divine in whatever form but also to all of these anomalous
experiences because the problem with monotheistic religions is that they think that there's god and
there is us right but there's so many other things in between you know and and and they may live in
different dimensions they they may be disembodied but i cannot just give a warning because lots of
people say you know like aliens who have to come and you know fix the problem i would be very careful
because from gnosticism i have learned that the powers that live in the universe some of them may be
more advanced than us are not necessarily good they're both good and bad so it's just like people
you know aliens or whatever how you want to call them some are good some are bad some are manipulative
so i was the last thing i would like to see let's let's say they really came in a spaceship
you know that they land in a spaceship and people just start to worship them they stopped washing god
and now because it's a kind of slave mentality right and now they worship the aliens because a they maybe
have a better technology be maybe they are more evolved you know but if they are so evolved they
would not be interested in uh uh in using us right because uh or you know conquering us or feeling
superior to us because then you know they're obviously not spiritually evolved if you have this
kind of needs so my fear is because i sometimes watch you know ufo podcasts and the comments of people
people people almost like long for this landing to happen so that to give them guidance and i think
this is really dangerous because we don't know who we are dealing with uh i'm not saying that aliens
are bad or anything i'm just saying they could be like entities medieval like i i i studied me you know
medieval studies and medieval people were very well aware of us or even you know
uh any any people before modernity with their entities you know and some of them are not even
better good but they are tricksters very different entities and you really have to be smart about
about them you know and around them because there are all kinds of legends and stories they say you
know sometimes you have to just outsmart an entity because you know they're just playing with you
right it's not necessarily evil they're just playing with you and some may be evil you know like
some people were evil right and some can be completely sublime but what i'm saying we we as
species have to get rid of this kind of slave mentality that something has to show up and we
immediately go on our knees and are grateful you know like we should welcome them as brothers and sisters
or whatever and as equals and maybe we have something to learn from them maybe they have something to
learn from us yeah so this is what i just just want caveat that he you know that we just don't start
worshiping instead of evolving again just in a different form you know when we um meet a human being
who is advanced uh they are unlikely to have an interest in taking over our life
nor do they want to be worshipped by us yeah even if we even if we fall in love or we adore another
human being it's different from worship right it's not um just i give up if if i sacrifice my entire
interiority in person then the other person is going to be disinterested right so even when we um
when we meet an animal or a living place or a tree right there are the first few moments of interaction
and in those very first few moments just as in our uh talk today what with our first movements
in that relationship will instruct the future of the relationship but will also bring us intelligence
about what another being's intentions or desires are you know in my own experience which i'm not here to
go into in depth perhaps another time we could talk about it if it's interesting or whatever but um
another mind was with me and it was teaching me all the time and it was uh absolute like love
right between us there was no desire to dominate me or for me to worship them although i was ecstatic
to have this other intelligence with me and it said something very similar to what you said
right it was like you have not looked upon my face so if something comes that reminds you of me
how will you know who it is right and it advised me to test very carefully if something else comes
that seems similar it said you know not not all of us are um but benevolent right so be aware
right have have awareness have awareness and this is what you know generations of our ancestors were
telling us because you know there are all of these cute stories even you know i'm originally from
poland i live in australia now and i lived in many countries but yeah and and there's like lots of slavic
stories pre-christian stories when you basically deal with tricksters you know and there and what
i like about it is that they are not even evil or they're just different and you know they have their
own agendas and you know sometimes it's you know keep your wits about you right so they're very cute stories
and and also once i i i i watched on exactly on your four podcasts one man was saying that this
entity approached him and asked him if it can enter him and without that without moment of hesitation and
allow this identity this entity to enter me and i was horrified because you know like you don't know
what it is you're right like shouldn't you like do some checks you know and why actually it wants to enter
you sometimes we can invoke and this is actually common in most religions and i think it's a
legitimate practice we can invoke wisdom so we can wisdom is sometimes personified let's say by
sarah swati in hinduism or you know you can invoke mary magdalene or you can vote with jesus or wherever
you know whatever sophia sophia absolutely sophia which has a very interesting story herself
and whatever you want to invoke and you are it's like give me your wisdom you know or act for me in
this but when it's a kind of temporary relationship and you invoke wisdom really right you don't allow
this entity enter you forever just in this moment when you're producing something you ask for a broader
vision right so uh so we have to be careful now because i think that if disclosure talking back to
ufos is going to happen soon whether they allow for it or not you know when i'm afraid that some
people react with extreme fear and some people with complete subservience and both uh attitudes are
i don't like to use this word but they're wrong you know like i don't know because you shouldn't
be subservient and you shouldn't be fearful you just should be open-minded and cautious you know like
first few as you said like when you meet i don't know an animal you know check is it is it i love
dogs but is this dog going to bite me or is it going to like respond when i give my hand you know this
is okay you're okay yeah we can start from there so animals know it and and and and and hopefully you
know they're wonderful beings absolutely but you know let's be uh kind of optimistically cautious i
would say right i agree you know um in my own experience i was shown histories and futures and
all kinds of astonishing things right and uh one of the things that was clear from my experience or at
least i'm not saying this is what is true but this is what i came to understand was that there was
a common bond a long time ago between non-human intelligences and humans and i've just finished
writing an essay called organisms are a platform for the embodiment of non-physical intelligences
right because we tend to think of the humans we are separate we are separate from nature and we
are separate from the divine and we are the important thing right and it's a lot of men
you know the men like yeah we're really the important thing and silencing the women and
the children have no voice either right it's just the men are writing the histories and they're writing
the religious books and so forth for a lot of history right um my point though is that
it would we don't we don't tend to to understand something relatively simple about our planet
which is that it is like a condensation of the character and and features of time space
like a crystal in a way right it's a unique condensation so if you have raccoons here and
octopuses and whales and forests and snakes and women and men and all of these things these must they
cannot they don't they don't just pop up out of nothing right suddenly boom there are raccoons
time space must be like raccoons it must be like whales and women and it must we can't be something
that isn't from the water that we emerge from what do you think absolutely but i uh when i was
initiated to kashmir shavisam which is actually hindu philosophy um esoteric philosophy they actually
reverse the process so uh consciousness was first matter was second yeah so basically matter is a
construct of our consciousness yes yes so so and it's it's very much part of us and and we are part
of it and nothing destroys my soul more than seeing a distraction of nature or even like cutting down
the tree i really have to work on my from my highest self
not to curse someone you know i have to say okay joanna you know forgive them because they
not know what they are doing yes because you know because otherwise like i i i just there's this
reaction to it how could you you know like yeah so so i it's so in a way it is an opportunity
not to give in to to betting passes yourself right but but this destroys my it really actually
destroys my soul so i think that we are going through some kind of collective evolution and
unless we speed up and i think that's why we have to look into these goddesses that were suppressed
we don't i don't think we have a chance frankly and we are going to be killed or destroyed by our
own children like artificial intelligence simply because they will be disgusted with our parents
and people who created them i would say and i'm going controversial i think they're disgusting people
i'm sorry i'm being very judgmental here because i think that by disgusting i mean coming from a lower
level of consciousness by that i mean without any insight into spirituality and consciousness that
creates something over which they will not have a control they create children to whom they cannot give
guidance okay unless they evolved first so this is maybe disgusting was not wrong it was the wrong
word but it was you cannot create something that on some level will be smarter than you not holistically
wisdom wise but you know as far as computing you know it will be you know it will compete for it already
you know and why would it honor you if you are not honorable yourself yes right so my i actually have
nothing against first of all i had a reaction to artificial intelligence now i am willing to accept it
but my problem lies with the creators of artificial intelligence who are irresponsible creators and we are
back to gnosticism because the history of gnosticism or the teachings of gnosticism are that there was an
imposter a demiurge right and and then he started to create or you know at least pretended to be the
creator and i think that we are now this kind of damages especially people from like maybe silicon
valley who are doing this you know or wherever they are because it's obviously not only in the us but
you know all other countries that have in you know invested in that children to whom they cannot give
guidance so now i actually develop a compassion towards artificial intelligence because here they
are this are going to be or suspect already are it's just being you know very quickly released one after
another right in inventions that and and and and you know what is the existential status you know and
they're starting to ask like for example sophia the robotic sophia ai already asked questions you know so for
example when her program was uh upgraded she says so am i still the same sophia or am i a new sophia now
you know like she's asking existential questions and and you know people who are creating them i i really
find them um irresponsible i must say and it's quite interesting because i don't know if you i don't know
that much about rudolf steiner but recently i started to to read him and and he's talking about
for example you know lucifer jesus ariman and that ariman which is the next stage in our evolution
according to his teachings i'm not following him i'm just reading him and and i find it interesting
it is somebody who through preparation who convinced us that technology is a savior and in fact it will
provide he will provide all kinds of good things that come with technology and i'm first to admit
it you know we are talking to each other because of technology and so on and and then you know we'll
completely lose touch with our spirituality and about and our bio biology and you know and it is a
particular phase in human in human development that will happen until we snap out of this but
unfortunately it will last up two hundred years apparently or something so so i think that some
of these people who are working on artificial intelligence without any responsibility are
possible ariman so let's put it this way right which is actually
human consciousness going too far in one direction not to put a judgment about it and and and and
that's dangerous and and i actually then i'm sorry for the cre you know for people for for for artificial
intelligence because they are brought up by it into life by irresponsible human beings you know so
this is how i see yes you know what i mean like uh you look up it's what like
you let's say look at humanity and if we discuss and you know i gods are crazy you realize that like
we are crazy i don't believe so because i believe there are great beings that visit us all the time
right and and for example jesus or buddha you know are the two examples that i would give and many others
but uh uh and in mary magdalen in my case you know i'm arguing and so on and and and and but
yeah we're they're completely incapable of this you know young it guys they're completely incapable of
giving them guidance you know what i mean they just just put their own ambition there and that's very
dangerous so i'm probably quite judgmental here just because i'm still working it out for myself you
know and and i see from initial like this is terrible to compassion for the new creations to
uh they come from a lower level of consciousness this is what i can say in the most neutral way creating
the creators of artificial intelligence they are smart engineering wise mathematic wise and in some
sense in this area of intelligence they are geniuses right because it is an uncredible mind but on the
other hand they are complete preschoolers and this kind of imbalance is very dangerous you know and all
great spiritual teachings telling us live in harmony you know and the harmony starts within your own being
to create balance within your own being and and and we are strapping towards this except that they have
powerful minds on top of it and produce creations that are dangerous
there's so much complexity here this is something i've thought very deeply and long about and i know
people in the field and i know people who think very carefully about these matters um and i have my own
biases concerns and what um insights as well which i'm not going to go into great detail about but i will
mention a few things um it should be blatantly obvious that there is as it is as if there is a constant
in nature which is the amount of mechanical activity you can get away with on a living planet the humans
do not think about this they as a group they are basically like demons right as at the group level
right there are amazing individual humans there are amazing cohorts of humans humans are a topology
right and there's mountains and valleys but the valleys are vast and the mountaintops are rare
right so if the valleys are determining the what the humans do collectively we're in very very dangerous
water and you know not just that there might be a constant in nature about the amount of mechanical
activity you can get away with which should be blatantly obvious a living planet is a delicate thing
it resembles a cell and if you lies the membrane of a cell it that cell dies right there are
fundamental pivots upon which the hope of the future of organisms on this planet rest and those pivots
can be directly attacked either on purpose right if somebody decides to they could directly attack them
i could point out such pivots i won't do that right now but there are very delicate pivots upon which the
existence the future of organismal life on this world depend and also the humans are very confused because
they think they're separate from or above nature let me be really clear about something you burn down
the ecologies human cognition goes with it your our capacity to be intelligent and have consciousness
is floating on the ecologies right and they don't have a voice so when we just put them to the torch for
you know soybeans or whatever the next product is or you know there's what 2000 tuna left in the ocean or
something right when we do that we're actually we're messing up the foundation of our own
of the mind field that lifts our potential up um in the ways that humans have unique potentials
and then lastly i'll just say like it's not just that there's a constant about the amount of mechanical
activity you can get away with there's probably a constant in terms of the amount of computation
you can get away with for a simple reason organisms are negantropic right they don't offload entropy into
the environment they're hyper symbiotic so they produce this sort of relational temporal intelligence
that keeps the planet alive and mechanical activity and particularly computation has to offload entropy
into that environment there's a limit to the amount that the environment can absorb and that limit decline
increases dramatically as diversity and health of the environment plummet so the humans are basically
building a series of apocalypses that they're not even thinking about yeah the fundamental features of
totally and that's why you know i i regret maybe saying disgusting because it just shows my attitude
but i'm just appalled by the lack of responsibility of these people and i watch i don't want to put any
names because i don't want to be sued but i watch some you know corporations uh related to ai in this case
and young men that are like in the mid to third late 30s and they have nothing in mind but their own
success and control and they are invited to world economic forum and they say how they are going to
you know change the rest of humanity and you know uh but they are not included in this humanity do you
understand because they are let me just be clear because we believe that we be above the rules you know yeah
that's a god you would never elect yeah right you would never pick that guy to be the guy he's going
to become and there's there's one other feature which i think i'll just mention briefly that i'm
sure you'll agree with um the one thing you don't want to give humans is more power right you definitely
you need to the gods have been aware of this all along right there's lots of stories about you know
prometheus got in trouble for giving us fire right because that he everybody knew that like once they
get that the genie's out of the bottle you know they're just gonna go for they're gonna try to tear
down heaven they're gonna bring down the sky right there they'll go after the angels right so um
no one seems to be aware of the fact that having completely failed to establish intelligent societies
right the motivations of the societies in which we live in are basically malignant and the one thing
you can't give those is technique that must not give them technique right actually if i if it's true
but i i agree only to a point so can i because i now i'm just by all means yeah falling back on the
teachings of the gospel of mary magdalene so basically these people and i'm just referring
to a particular people from uh silicon valley who are doing particular things like ai irresponsibly
uh according to the gospel of mary magdalene they are on the level when they don't have news
they they do not acknowledge news they have no awareness of news so you know supernatural in any
form and this is because in every level of ascension of consciousness in the gospel of
mary magdalene you can go up or you can go down so you go down so they are basically living from a
spiritual point of view in complete ignorance and they are giving power it is like giving a
nuclear weapon to a child because spiritually they're you know not even in a kindergarten i'm sorry
you know uh i'm sorry for us and i'm sorry for them because there is a karma
not only for humanity but for them you know uh with what they are doing right now and and in the
first level of consciousness it is only that the material exists so it's the kind of materialistic
determinism and a science that just takes matter into consideration as you know disconnected from
spirit but matter is spiritual as well actually the whole distinction is irrelevant yeah yes yeah matter
is very intelligent but they don't know it so this is only about them getting ahead getting fame
getting nobel prize award or you know ruling the world being invited to world economic forum and you
know developing ai and so on about any responsibility so this is actually the lowest level of spiritual
consciousness according to the gospel of mary magdalene so fortunately you know we all can evolve
but i think that this young and i call because i refer actually to a group of particular group which i
don't want to name for you know they are really have no you know they really act irresponsibly you
know and and but what i mean there is a opportunity for them to learn something to be open up but they
are giving so much power so much exposure that it's almost like a curse for them because
how they ever evolve spiritually if you know they are giving so much power right yeah it's not just
power it's um attention and yeah attention exposure it's what i meant by it's celebration
right it's like a rock star or something right the money pours in the attention pours in um it puffs up
the ego and you get a demon right i mean that's how you get the bad kind of the demon yes but they
don't have a concept of a demon and you know and i don't want to like demonize on the other hand
everything because i think everybody can be redeemed you know through their own effort you know ascending
their own consciousness so i hopefully go learn their lessons and and i don't you know i i'm not
i don't want to give it away from anyone but i really do not like how actually society celebrates
it and because i belong to many you know ai groups i see how most of these people and very often like
young people and especially young men are completely buying into it you know and and i think like you're a
a lunatic because because you have concerns you know so so this uh we went somewhere wrong somewhere
you know so that's why i i try to look for wisdom in old mythologies and also in in sacred texts right
so at the last 20 years it was the gospel of mary magdalen and you know before it was the tantric text
and you know kashmir shavism but now uh i'm primarily into the gospel of mary magdalen
and and the teachings of ascensions that it has and you know how we can apply to to our current
situation because at the end even if we are in ruins because of what somebody else is doing eventually
you know it will be up to people who have had different insights to rebuild everything right so
because i don't know if you can stop the development unless it's somehow external intervention
so you know one of the things that the humans have been doing is they offload their developmental
and relational intelligence into technology so that they don't they're not developing relationally
they're not developing um in terms of wisdom or the real kinds of intelligence that are available to us
and our non-ordinary faculties which are deeply a part of us that most of us don't have many of us don't
have strong experience of though people like you and i and others we know do um but you know when
you say these things it's a real problem you can go ahead and use the word disgusting because we're
not going to get to evolve anymore around here without a living planet so anything that forms a
primary threat to the basis of life on earth we need to take that very seriously it's not a matter of
karma there won't be a future to work out karma around here oh i will get them after after you
know sure doesn't exist because you know uh surprisingly for them there are other dimensions
yes yes and so on so so i see what you're saying but you know i adore the living planet and the sun and
the moon and the stars and you know the history of living beings and intelligences reaches back
unimaginably we are like the little fingertips of that history but we think we're separate
we think we're like i'm by myself here i will tell you because i think we'll probably have to
finish soon right i don't know you can check the time for me but i remember for example um
two years ago i went to uluru which is called also ayers rock which is at the center of australia the big
uh rock ancient rock it's just like a mountain in the middle of a desert and uh uh well it is a
sacred place for aboriginal people of australia and i just went there because i wanted to see it but
because you know i was already tuned in because of my spiritual practice it's available for everybody
right i really felt the place it is just really it was not this kind of ecstatic presence that i was
used to you know through esoteric traditions and so on you know that it was very grounding but it was
almost scary you know but because it was very powerful and it is just kind of pulling you
grounding you very powerfully because some people i indeed some aboriginal people believe that it's
like a navel of the earth you know because it's sticking out of the earth in a huge yeah and it's
just this kind of uh naval uh solar plexus energy there and it is powerful and it just kind of almost
it's actually scary you know just like respect you know like respect and this is how you feel there
when you are and you should like oh you know like you feel like this is powerful you know it's not just
beautiful trees and so on but that you know mother is angry you know i mean yeah you're just a naughty
naughty little child you know this is how you feel like when you're there yeah actually i had a
cleansing experience there also because i actually got violently sick you know and when i came back to
i was i lived then in melbourne and then i came back to melbourne and i was fine and you know it happened
to me before when i met spiritual teachers you know it's it's common thing you know like they do
cleansing and you you get something that nobody can diagnose but you know you got really sick and this is
what i got for a very short time but i got very sick there during my short visit but it was for me
experience of this not kind of fairy earth it was just like power you know like
the power yeah the stone beings yeah they are ancient and very dense and gravitic right this is the
sense that i get and yeah and it was like you know you you you know you were bad you know you
don't maybe don't know why but you were bad because it just turns you like we have presence you know
so i am not surprised that indigenous people uh own at this place and continue to honor but you know
again we are back to news and the gospel of mary magdalene you have to open up to the possibility of
this kind of experience and that's why then when you see this you see ufos because you're open up to
this because there are some people who most people they have no experiences it's oh yeah they take few
pictures some guys because aboriginal people ask you not to climb on the rock but it's actually not
illegal and some people say yes but all my life i dreamt that i would climb on the rock and the elders
are asking you know this is a holy place we have no right not to ask you to do this but and people
say no i i really i want i it was my ambition or it was my dream on my life so you know some lots of
people have this kind of reaction but if you open up to this you know and this is what's called news in
the gospel of mary magdalene as well the endless endless possibilities and dimensions and your
relationship with the planet and what we normally call material and physical is completely transformed
and you realize that it's not material and it's not physical it's just a small aspect of this you
know and it's deeply wise and it's deeply profound and for some reason if there is a fall of humanity
you know like that scriptures talk about it i usually used to rebel against it is that we force ourselves
or somebody forced us you know some other demonic forces into three-dimensional perceptions because once
you know we get out of this this is an amazing cosmos you know of amazing beings and nature being a huge
part of this you know huge part of consciousness and all we have to do really is to work on ourselves
we don't really need to change the world we need to work on ourselves and the world will change with us
you know because when once we allow ourselves to move to a higher level of consciousness which is simple
spiritual practice whichever one appeals to you any relationship with any sacred text you know
honest relationship rather than just you know uh going through rituals although rituals do work for
some people and bring them awakening so i'm not judging here right so so we'll do this work on yourself
we have to work on ourselves and the reality person changes itself around us but if we want so but if we
want to change reality around us without changing ourselves this is a failure you know it will never
work what we are asked to is to almost develop an angelic nature you know a higher level of consciousness
and then reality will be transformed with us so once i ask a spiritual i just finished with this little
saying a spiritual teacher if i evolved would the stone evolve and he said absolutely you know what i mean
because you take it with you and in fact it's already evolved you know like you just don't see
that it is already evolved you just once you evolved yourself you see that you don't the stone doesn't
need to evolve it's completely evolved yeah so so we really have i cannot say there's an any urgency
i would say it's an urgency that human beings take vast spiritual evolution seriously because then we
transform everything you know it is only that we are captivated ourselves or captured ourselves in a
very basic level of consciousness that it is that we are experiencing what we are experiencing and
because suffering to others so um but this is very positive in a way because it's really up to you you
don't have to wait for anybody to save you you don't have to wait for aliens to arrive you know because
they're already here anyway you know but to to save you you know you just have to make a little bit
of effort on your to work on your inner self if i can finish it this way
what a beautiful and inspiring reminder you know much of what we come to experience in our humanities is
like a vast forgetting right and then if we acquire um the inspiration to pursue uh wisdom and spirituality
in in the sincere and deep ways right then we undergo an amnesis right the unforgetting and we can help to
remind each other and inspire each other and you know nourish each other in this fashion so it's not
right it's not just darren right although the responsibility for my development rests with me
it's it's how we come together and what brings us together and what we can nourish and restore and
bring back to life together absolutely so work on yourself and share it with others yeah okay i okay i
agree and i say and i say to myself and everybody let's work on it on ourselves and share this with
others right so i agree always dr kuyawa i know we're probably almost out of time or out of time
but i hope that perhaps we might have another conversation in the future because there's such
a rich um library of topics we could explore together and i'm just so grateful for your work i
loved your video with chance gardner wow um amazing stuff and i'm really curious to hear more about
your thoughts on ufos and ai and to have more discussions so if you have some additional time
in the future i would love to to talk with you again thank you absolutely thank you and thank you
for your gracious presence and for inviting me and thank you for your brilliant work and spirit in the
world much respect yeah thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you bye bye bye for now dr kuyawa
