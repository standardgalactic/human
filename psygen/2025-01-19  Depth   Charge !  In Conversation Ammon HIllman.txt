i'm out just absolutely thrilled to have some time together what an amazing opportunity and
privilege good i'm you know why i wanted to follow up and meet with you is because your article was so
accurate because you know people can write things about you and most of the time it's like 50
and you managed to you managed to i don't know you did your research or something but somehow
you were able to get into my character as well and i i thought it was the best thing that i've seen
period so i'm yours you can let's talk about whatever you want right on um i got some tea
water boiling i'm gonna bring that in here in a second um i'm so grateful that you could take the
time looks like you got to your office so that we can have a better connectivity it's a little it's
no it's the same crappy connectivity so um but i'm using a better computer um than i usually do to
teach and whatnot um i'm glad i'm getting better receptivity because they hit that cable they hit
that fiber line and taos and everybody's bad it was even we even went to the library and the speeds were
still slow there so you know i'm glad it's not just me all right i'm gonna put a i'm gonna pour
a little more hot in my tea yeah take your time man finally can you hear me yeah i can hear you okay
get get me up oh finally okay fine there we are i'm so sorry it wouldn't let me back in i was like oh my
god i'm gonna get shut out for good okay it looks like the internet's cooperating so let's do let's do
whatever we need to do sounds good man uh i just want to show you my my fit for today
lone wolf and cub in honor of you being a ronin oh that's nice i like that i'd like that you probably
don't know the story but it's about a samurai who got framed and so he just went against everything
took his kid with him on the road and became a hired assassin oh right nice nice i like that
is it is there somewhere is it what's the title of it again in case i want to look it up and read it
yeah it's it's lone wolf and cub it's a manga um one of my favorite stories i've uh is it based on a
samurai on a real samurai who did this it's unclear um it seems to to steal a little bit from musashi's
life ah who's musashi so musashi is probably the single most famous samurai um when i was in my 20s i
read a book a novel about his life and it deeply influenced me uh you know i studied martial arts and um
um was fascinated with japanese culture for a long time still am uh that book actually resulted in me
beginning to study zen meditation
i i was impressed i read a um just out of my own interest because it has nothing to do with my field
when i was a grad student i thought i'm gonna read something about the samurai and when i found out
their poetry skills i was like oh wow this is a little bit more sophisticated and i you know um so
the i'm sure this famous samurai was an author of some kind of haiku or something you know or maybe
involved um it is that a big factor in the manga like you know do they try to go all historical
on you with it or is it more is it more fictional it's a little bit of both um musashi i think is
famous for having written the book of five rings so he did write he he started out as kind of a
barbarian right he was a coward and sort of a an idiot and he became uh one of the most amazing swordsmen
ever that ever lived um though you know it's not my it's not my goal to explore the samurai heritage today
i just wanted you to know that i recognize something in your way of life ah ah okay yeah fantastic it's the
it's a freedom was this were these samurai free i think they were when they became wrong and although
there was such shame attached to it so i kind of feel i kind of felt that when somebody told me that
they said you're really ronin right um yeah i think it's i think it is there um let's hope i know how to use
that sword right that's all that matters right okay let me shut up and let you ask some questions or
discuss whatever format you want let's go for it yeah so i want this to be a conversation so i want
you to feel free to ask questions or you know delve into anything and uh that comes to you love your t-shirt
there that's amazing the the two snake chariot right yeah that's medea's dragon chariot right right on i
have a uh an old vintage cloison pin with that image on it that i found during the time that the uh the
the angel quote unquote was with my mind and that was like a nine month period in 2002 so that's where i
learned that's where i got my education right about the gods origin magic all these things i was in a
school you know for for nine months with something i don't know exactly what it was i refer to it as an
angel a source of inspiration is that is that yeah that'd be putting it mildly it was like being dead
while i was alive oh that must give you a fantastic vantage i mean uh you're at a point a vantage point
where you can see things if you're in that zone you know nine months jesus yeah what did you learn
oh my god enough for a thousand lifetimes i mean it changed everything that i thought about everything
really did it's part of it's part of what i recognized in you right you can recognize the
fingerprint of either the dead or the gods in another person's mind and thought right you can
sense it the muse the muse you can smell smell her perfume it's very nice
so i just want to take a moment and thank you for the amazing work you do you're educating so many
people you're teaching ancient greek just that by itself if you were just teaching the ancient
languages that would be an amazing service to the people and you do it for free you're not trying to
make money yeah no i do i do have a paid dojo though i have students that pay me hourly yeah teach
them greek right on not connected with lady babylon but i have to earn as a as you know
as somebody with a satanic contract i have to earn my own way so it's part of the you know i don't
know it's the physics of everything but yeah no i teach for i want you to i want that to be clear i
teach for cash right um but lady babylon can't be a part of that i don't i don't want to anything i say
to ever be yoked to some kind of profit potential or some crap like that you know what i mean i do my own
works very similar right the work that i do which is my soul work that's not a money making thing um
it has to be free of that binding right yeah yeah otherwise how are you gonna how are you going to be
truthful right right you're gonna have to worry about interfering with with your livelihood every
time you open your mouth yes and so another thing that i want to that i want to mention here so first of
all thank you for the work you do it's amazing i respect you as a teacher and someone who's
instructing uh the new generations that's awesome also appreciate you i appreciate the fact that you
don't allow advertising on your youtube channel so we can watch you uninterrupted correct i also can't
imagine how you've managed to evade youtube bans because your content is about as provocative as it
could possibly be and yet somehow they don't take that down look look somebody somebody explained it
to me once that not and when i heard this i was just as amazed as you will be um for those of us who
don't monetize when we can and it is not many no i can promise you yeah i'm one of them it is not me
okay when we don't monetize somebody explained to me that that keeps us off the algorithm that's searching
for a reason to kick you off so um people have tried in the past over the last two years
people have tried numerous times to like report you for content right some kind of violation of
content rules um and what i would every time we do we appeal and we win right so um i we're following
chewy is following very closely uh the things that we can and can't do and i think between that and the
fact that we're not monetized i don't think we're getting the same scrutiny that we would if we were
bent over and somebody were advertising up our backside yeah right yeah if we were if we were taking
it from the posterior position yeah yeah now i did for the first time a couple weeks ago i interviewed
uh a russian scholar and we spoke briefly about topics related to um the poisoning of food and
they took that off instantly they just they were just like no you can't say anything about medicine
right nothing so wow seriously yeah and i'm not monetized so that's the only thing that i've ever had
that i got my first strike i have 400 videos right and talk about all kinds of crazy
shit but that was just for that just for talking about wow and by the way so i want to be clear
this video probably won't go on youtube to protect me from getting a mark so i want you to feel
absolutely absolutely candid right we can say i want you to just be completely whatever whatever
you're feeling whatever you want to say no censorship i don't have to worry about f-bombs or anything
no nothing um perhaps perhaps there's something more to what you're saying about why lady babylon
is staying on the staying up and not getting taken down seemingly defying the odds maybe it's not so
much to do with the algorithm because we're not advertising um and we're not drawing that attention
um maybe it's something um maybe it's something wow maybe it's something different if you figure
out what it is let me know because we've tried to stay within utter bounds of purity yet we can very
clinically talk about texts that say the most
i don't know um provocative provocative disturbing provocative you know it's a you could say it's a
miracle that we've been able to stay uh active and i am grateful for that i'm me too for that you know
it certainly occurs to me that um the intelligences and the beings whom you invoke and and whom you
are in a sense the human voice of may have a say in such matters oh isn't that gorgeous yeah
fantastic yeah gorgeous
it is oh god i love it i love it i love it i love the discoveries all the discoveries
with the best jar the timing was absolutely impeccable they found a drug with vaginal
excretions and body fluids in it all right one of these compound drugs who has been yelling about that
who has been yelling about that it's the guy who says he talks to the muse yeah one guy yeah right
yeah okay fantastic fantastic right same channel oh i love it i love it and just to get something
sorry i didn't mean to interrupt no just to get one other thing out of the way um we got to sing
chewy's praises my god like yeah absolute support gives you a whole other dimension
of your presentation takes care of the tech i mean wild hand of applause for chewy
oh are you kidding she knows that too she knows it so um uh you'll probably hear her in this danny
she was in the background doing like documentary type stuff which by the way chewy we can release that
now now that he's released i can we can put that up as footage maybe fun i don't know people may
want to see it maybe not but yeah so yeah yeah just just so much respect and appreciation for chewy and
everything she uh contributes to the work right so beautiful so powerful yeah it is it is and she flies
that lines just she threads that needle perfectly um because she doesn't put stuff up there that's going
to get us kicked off right and yet it has to cover material that has to that is that depth of darkness
and she's able to summon it you know what i mean without without um in a very kind of genteel sort of
artistic way so you know it doesn't come out as pornographic you know what i mean it comes out as
yeah almost almost documentary like and i think that's a i think that's why you need that virgin oracle
you know what i mean you need that you need that uh vision i don't know i don't know and it's a good
thing she knows how to run everything because all i know is to stick this thing in my face that's all i
know you know what i mean yeah well um you've been provided with not merely an assistant but a co-pilot
of incredible depth insight creative ability so i just you know i just want to um praise
absolutely praise that and and acknowledge and respect her profound contribution to the work yeah
and she is listening and i need you to also understand that she has one motive one motive for
to know i'm going to say it because people want to know she has one motive for doing this entire thing
and that is to get the attention of henry cavill and that that is such a powerful driving motivation
um i i congratulate her for that and i hope someday i hope someday that you know he walks in and we
you know we have some kind of um universal reward you know what i mean so that's why i'm doing it
because she's holding me prisoner no i'm just kidding and you love it i know you you want to be held
prisoner a willy prisoner so okay side question that crop that you use off camera whack whack whack
is that the crop from medea it is i thought so yeah yeah how did you know that were yeah i'm i'm a
tricky i'm a detective really oh my god that's amazing i didn't know because i didn't think i said that
lately but yeah that's the one from the play so it's got a very special significance it does it does
i jumped on the stage with it when we're um the administrator came in told us um they had raided
the props right right they've raided the prop department because they didn't fasten them the
fasten them was a problem exactly and people were so pissed off those students wanted that man torn to
pieces for what they were doing so that was the whip that um it's kind of a symbol of the freedom
of the stage and people got it those students picked it up like that it's like an ancient it's like an
ancient practice that you just offer the people and it's like it's natural or something but yeah that's
a um yeah i was whipped with it that was one of the issues that was in the deposition i read that
yeah dude it's not funny it's like they wanted to know well how many times were you hit you know
what okay okay it's like they're really into it they're grooving on it and then the thing that
people don't realize um maybe they do if they've got the full deposition because it's all there but
they had a whole catalog a whole catalog of whips and dildos that they had pulled off the internet that
because somebody had run an article that i was in on the site they thought i was like a some kind of
dildo purveyor you know yeah yeah i read that and they're they were trying to get you to explain
the meaning of bdsm and you had no idea what that meant and they couldn't believe that you couldn't
that you didn't know that they clearly knew what bdsm meant and they're just like in the inquisition
they're interrogating you and you're like bondage sex i don't know what those other letters mean like
the bondage part i know but the other stuff i have no idea bro like what but you guys seem to know
all about this i mean it's kind of ironic right the inquisitors know what this four letter you know
acronym means but the uh the defendant doesn't clearly does not know right they they were total perverts
man they were total perverts i thought i was gonna have to take off my clothes i thought i was gonna
have to take off my clothes i couldn't believe it i was like dude this guy's really interested i even
talked with my attorney afterwards rye what's the dude wanted to get me naked number one and thanks that
i have some kind of cult that's gonna involve these catholic virgins oh god it was these people were
they had some dirty dirty stuff in their minds yeah they did no and i just i felt um i felt sorrow
for you being subjected to that kind of idiotic inquisition and them like refusing to call you dr hillman
right you would say like would you please refer to me as dr hillman and they'd be like yes mr hillman
we will right yeah it was demeaning the whole thing but that's part of it my lawyer said they're
gonna do that to you just to get you to explode or you know to give them something that's bad
right that's this so i kind of saw that stuff coming but um when he asked me the uh final time that
i answered um are you the god pan i was honestly sitting there like it was the most surreal moment
of my life i thought what did he just say what i think he said and he did and i was trying to sit
there i was sitting there as my lawyer was objecting i was sitting there trying to figure out what
what what is in the mind of this cruel pervert you know it was it was exactly a bacchic mirror
right i could look i could look into this image and see the reality that was the interrogator
and i realized oh god that's that pentheus that's that that's why they're reflecting the
all the bacchic religion does is reflect back to the individual who they actually are
right which the guy is projecting it was perverse it was perverse it had a slight sting of masochism to it
and the fact that they had that whole catalog stuff i'm not none of that's mine do i sell that do i
have anything to do that no it has nothing to do with me and you could tell that they knew it and they
leaked all of my personal information they took all of my personal file and made it public and my attorney
said that it's intimidation is what it is and the whole time there's nothing that i can do because who
the hell am i i got no money right i can't influence the judge right so we were in a we were in an
uphill battle but it was a worthy a worthy fight you know i remember when it finally occurred to me
you know i've grown up in america i haven't really been to other countries i haven't traveled much
really not at all and i remember the day it occurred to me that um the idea of rights was kind of
ridiculous because you really don't you only have the rights that you can afford to defend and for
many of us that's none all right so the idea that we have rights is a sort of a legal fiction
right you have it brilliantly said brilliantly said gorgeous yeah and something that we share
and which i recognized in you right away when i first heard you speaking on um danny jones's
original podcast you know we have uh an ache in our soul for justice not justice is vengeance justice
is the restoration of something profound and actually intelligent yeah beautiful something beautiful
right yeah yeah putting that back where it belongs oh god i totally pagans man we're pagans i think
yeah all right so i do have a ton of questions and i've got curiosity about a whole range of stuff
i did do a lot of research on you but it wasn't really research right it's like fascination
i recognize something in you that's familiar from my own experience and one of the things i recognize
is that throughout life you know we are subjected to situations that are painful and that hurt us and they
hurt our our capacity to be professionals in the world or they may destroy that capacity
and these are like experiences of death right part of us dies in that process and then if we're lucky
on the other side of that death there's a resurrection right and we come into life in a new way
right with a new mind and a new a new purpose and a new spirit and obviously you've been through a few
of these deaths i mean from what i understand you were raised to christians am i have i got this wrong
yes no absolutely i would say baptist okay i would say christian but um yeah love jesus man totally part of
it totally part of it yeah definitely so was there a sort of a juncture which there was a profound schism
there talk about that process for me say whatever whatever comes to mind what's in your heart about it
and i just said it on danny jones too i just said it on danny jones i was reading aristotle
and reading aristotle and seeing the beautiful complexity of nature oh god and exactly what that
purposeful hand of the muse is um you see they said cosmos was the organization that is everything
and that cosmos is
really a way for you to interact with the divine yes that
it's it's it's a it's a means of um pulling out of the person what is that corruption and you know
those guys are sitting around like mythagoras saying oh this is every 3 000 years how the hell
did they come up with that i don't know in that aspect but um uh i was reading aristotle with all of
this in mind and i suddenly realized i was 21 and i suddenly realized you know what um they were right
that nature he is gorgeous and it clicked in my head and i put my aristotle down i put on some nice clothes
with some cheap cologne and i was a virgin and why was i a virgin because jesus was watching me he used to
watch me he used to watch me do things and imagine you know i was so susceptible to the beauty from the
very beginning to suppress it in my christian virginity was so incredible that on that night
reading aristotle i drove to a bar and i picked out a woman and i said hi this is my situation and i'd like
to be done with my virginity are you up for a go and proceeded to start my pathway of learning what is
that nature and that beauty and what is it about christianity that wants to kill that to snuff that
out and to take that component of what is the cosmos the organization of the universe why do they want to
stifle that so it's almost like it was a religious thing for me that involved self-awareness and that
that was coming through that god that beautiful uranian queen you know what i mean um aphrodite was also
called urania and because she's the product of uranos right um and that component of ancient mystery
was what the monists first cut out and i think they did so because that is an a it's like a battery or
some kind of powering for the individual to um uh for them to see a beauty put back where it's supposed
to be and um yeah and that was my moment so uh if you can say it um i i totally understand why it is that
people associate sexuality with um sin and temptation and the devil because in the pagan way of thinking
nature is what we worship right makes sense right so um nature doesn't do things that are not
beautiful and for us to see her put together the world through this act of coitus perhaps the coitus is
a religious experience and i mean imagine that imagine people that think coitus is a religious
experience because everybody says oh you know those those idolaters those pagans they were you know what
they were doing they were sex stuff prostitution going on that's because they looked at sex and the act
of orgasming as a heightened state of awareness you know if you want to call it spiritual go ahead
right i i don't understand the physics myself but all right isis and osiris the stuff was catchy
it's not like there was only one group of people that was doing this right so um why is she carrying
the phallus around right it's because you're within a culture that has stifled that vision of aphrodite
and that's all the bachic mysteries did was bring the person to aphrodite so oh god you know how can
how can you let that stuff go i don't know we got to bring this stuff back let people know
so that's where i escaped christianity and i told danny that too yeah amused liberated me
beautiful gorgeous oh love it
so you know i had my own uh walk i i started out as an atheist
and then i became interested in magic for time in my uh teens late teens i was exposed to crowley
not a fan of crowley by the way um but that was why is that why is that did you discover
that he was a kook or something it's it's a complicated thing the simple answer is um
i knew these two young german guys that were christians right they had to go to a fundamentalist
church every day but they were secretly practicing uh you know the rights of the oto and stuff
and um they couldn't have they couldn't have crowley's books sent to their house so
they had the book of the law sent to my house and i remember i was fascinated to receive that thing i was
like what the hell is this right i'm i'm hyperlexic i've been a reader since i was a little kid books
have been my education not not school i've never been to high school for example um and that book
came and i paged through it a bit and then i was i was feeling into the ethos of that thing right
and i got in the shower and i had a vision and the vision was that there was a giant uh wasp
outside the shower like a monster kind of and this is one of the things that terrifies me because i i
got stung when i was a young kid and it nearly killed me it wasn't allergies just got sepsis right
and i love insects i'm fascinated by insects my entire life but the wasps scare me and i just saw
this this sort of um image of this wasp hovering outside the shower and it was one of the first
non-ordinary experiences that i had while i was awake right it was a vision right it was in it was
there i could sense it and i just got the feeling in a very deep way in my heart this path is not for
you do not take this path your path lies elsewhere right that kind of thing so after that i stopped
studying crowley although it's clear he was um an incredible scholar of magical tradition and practice
there's no doubt of that it's kind of a shitty writer um wrote thousands i've i've absolutely never
read a word but he wrote a novel that came across my way cocaine diaries i think oh right yeah yeah yeah
yeah yeah i think that's yeah that's the only thing i've been exposed to i didn't read that sacred
book or anything so how did it strike you like have you you said you um you mentioned young didn't you
i haven't mentioned young i'm somewhat somewhat aware of young's work have you read any of the red
book yes yeah the red book is an astonishing non-ordinary thing right how would you compare
the red book with the with crowley because i haven't read any of him okay so you know one of the
traps okay so there are some let's just be clear there are some traps about being human right
there's a difference between virtue and vice
and and you can engage in sex in a way that is spiritual and religious
and you can engage in sex in a way that lowers your soul down i think and or demeans other people
or demeans yourself what do you think now now okay wait a minute wait a minute what if your job
is to demean what if the perspective is this is hell and you are a punisher and if that means demeaning
then we require demeaning to wash away your corruption that's an interesting perspective um i get it right
obviously i don't i don't necessarily think that human existence is heaven or hell yeah what it is is
oh yeah it's the entire continuum of the possibility space of incarnation there's hell in there there's
heaven in there there's theater there's play there's disaster there's tragedy there's horror
right it's all part of that continuum and perhaps as humans uh one of the one of the aspects of our
agency as incarnate beings is to um instruct that possibility space what are your thoughts
to to instruct it to instruct it i find that fascinating but i have to i have to think about
it to instruct it if you mean that i get to spank someone i'm going for it you know what i mean
well if you want real instruction i think it has to do with um the ultimately the power of the eremon
that wilderness where the mind goes under the influence under the visionary influence right in
into that place where the devil becomes the tempter i think the whole purpose is to find that
perfect
existence that purified i think it's why the mysteries are always focused on purification
what is this initiation going to do it's going to purify you what the hell i mean i'm still going
to work next week right what do you mean it's going to purify me i think that's the i think
the purpose of the mystery is to bring that individual into association with that creative voice
voice and um i think that that creative voice of necessity must be just and that's why
joining up with lucifer means you get to fuck ass right right you get to bring you get to bring
people exactly the hypocrisy that they are and show it to them in the mirror say this is you you know
why it's because i am the god of the dead right dionysus hades right the devil
um i think that's um i think that's the power i think it's necessary it's not like there's a
i have no moral problem with talking to somebody who loves jesus christ and telling them awful things
about jesus christ why because they need to hear it if they're going to be purified yes it'll be painful
um demeter is holding demophon the little kid over the fire just like thetis is holding achilles over
the fire fumigating his little ass right and it's painful it's burning his eyes and everything it's
painful so everybody comes to the defense of the little kid oh you know what i was doing i was
burning off his mortality you can have him back now he'll be half as smart
yeah gorgeous i mean there's there's a reality in it that must be satanic or saturnian we have to
we have to continue with with the contract you know what i mean
fallen angel sexy stuff what do you think about the bible what's your take on the bible stuff
so you know i was reading novels by the time i was five and uh i was as i mentioned hyperlexic so
i i was i had an easy grasp of language and i gotta tell you that um the only book that i ever
encountered that i couldn't make any sense out of at all was the bible i was just like what the actual
fuck is this this cannot be this is the primary book of the people all over the world this really
did that drive your atheism or no not not really the thing that drove my atheism was the idea of a
kind of cruel punishing surveilling god right um and also let's be really clear about something very
simple by the time you have to give people laws and rules they are no longer human they're just not
being human if you got to write that down and make commandments about don't kill each other
and please don't lie and you are you are living in a situation that is absolutely
by the time you have to say no no god said these 10 things and it's brilliant that's brilliant
somebody you know i'm you need to bring that up to the world because that's you know that's gorgeous
that's just straight up reason that's your you're just flexing your reason muscles god damn that's
gorgeous yeah we don't have to tell each other i don't have to come to you and say amen we're gonna
be friends right don't murder me right don't you know don't do bad things to my daughters
right don't steal my house and don't lie right and and you know don't do things with my wife when i'm
not home i don't have we don't have to start out because if i have to start out that way where what
kind of a hell are we actually living in right like we're fucked if you have to have um formal to the
degree you have to have formal agreements your humanity is missing in action yeah it is because
you should know that stuff you should know that and your heart should have taught you nature should have
taught you you come from her she'll show you and everything she'll teach you the way to act oh my god
don't we have that naturally when we interact with our mothers even if our mothers are assholes
isn't there some kind of natural morality that comes through that i don't end up my sister when
i'm eight right of course there is it's fantastic i love it it's and that's why i hate when paul the
apostle says oh you you worship the creation not the creator you right oh god sorry about that
that no no so actually my my temple was the living creatures right the plants and the insects and the
animals and the sky and the mountain and the forest and the lake and the river that was my temple as a
child naturally right no one had to tell me this is beautiful but the idea that there was um some kind
of central scrutinizer right just overseeing and constantly you know really a jealous god like
if i come to you as a friend and i say almond you will only love me you have no other friends
right what are you going to think about me like what what kind of a guy am i i'm gonna think that
you're probably gonna put cameras everywhere you can see me all the time right you know what i mean
and you know there's a function i i study i've studied for many years i work with a neuroscientist
and i study mental illness i don't study it as as a clinician i study it as someone who's trying to
understand the nature of human minds and awareness and stuff oh i didn't know you were a neuro guy i
didn't know that that's oh yeah big time yeah i've worked with a neuroscientist for 20 years and i was
fascinated with the brain long before that but um what i'm trying to get at is the idea that there's
a negative overseer is a critical feature of schizophrenia right is that right oh yeah um
and schizophrenics will often draw like a single eye kind of like the eye of toth in egypt right um
that single eye and that represents an aspect of consciousness that has split off
and become domineering and it's it's very similar to what you see in the accounts of yahweh
right it's not the only thing that is said about yahweh but this this is a central feature i'm a jealous
god you will have no gods before me or after me or around me or anything right and and i watch you all
the time right i'm a scrutinizer if you jerk off yeah yeah so you know um i had a natural disaffinity
for the idea of a punishing god now on the other hand i mean there's you know i tend to have a a
complex view of stuff right i'm not just on one side of an argument well yeah yeah we should be nobody
should be totally i mean i've talked with christian mystics and i've been inside um nunneries and
talked with the old nuns and i've talked with the old monks you know at the monastery and i have to say
like when i went and had the privilege of sitting down for four hours with a couple of carmelite nuns
that was one of the high moments of my life those those beings were shining with what i can only
understand as spiritual bliss and beauty and power right there's no way i can criticize that for me
right you make me want to date them you know what i mean yeah yeah i get you no i mean i never
encountered purity you're saying they were pure for you know for goodness sake that's yeah no i totally
i know it was like sitting in the room it was like sitting in the room with the angels it really
was they were not human they were they had become something so profound that i had never encountered
in the secular world so i want to be careful for myself uh no um no bridles on you right yeah for
myself i have great reverence for people who travel sincerely any spiritual path right i have great
reverence yes yes of course it's the sincerity it's the sincerity that is that goodness yeah no yeah
yeah totally with you right on um all right so i have some other i have a whole sheaf of questions
and i'm so i'm just so excited to be doing this together man this is awesome let's do it love it
all right when did okay when did you let's see actually i'm gonna start here i'll come back to
jesus a little later what do you mean when you use the name satan because i don't think you're talking
about the biblical satan if even such a thing exists that looks to me like an invention over time i don't
know but what do you mean when you use this name i'm talking to the satan um i'm talking to the same
satan that lord byron has cain talk to i'm talking to that overthrown guardian who was sincere
with eve i'm talking about that individual is that individual and historic individual that
individual is a cosmic individual part of the organization of the makeup of the cosmos
and my recognition of that is no different than my recognition of the gorgeous tree outside or you
know um any of the goodies that we have it's still part of nature so that's how you know i look at it as
as soon as i saw how the greeks were looking at divinity i was my mind was was blown up because
we don't look at when you say god in the sense of western god um or you're talking about the son of
god um you really are not talking about what they were talking about when they said god right and so um
when you can look i try to crack people with this with love and because sometimes that gets through
them if you look at eros that desire and it's not love like you're thinking it's not romance it's that
desire that desire for sexual intercourse is the origin of the orphic universe eros is very much the devil
very much the winged one from whom who is the beauty the primary beauty of creation
right eos for us so the sincerity in the in the serpent's instruction of eve that look you know um you're not
going to die right your eyes are going to be opened right and what does the text say happen
your eyes were opened and she knew that blah blah blah and he said he's just afraid god is afraid that
you're going to be like him right that sincerity is to me the it's that divinity that the greeks would recognize
and why they would say um lucifer the bringer of dawn is a divine entity a member of the cosmos
remember they said we're just the reflection of the reality the gods are in the real we are
reflections of their activities yes i don't and i don't get the physics of that but it's beautiful if
you think about it you know i don't think physics is the arbiter of the nature of things i study
physics right i'm fascinated i'm fascinated by physics but um there's a there's sort of there's
something beyond it and what the greeks and the ancient peoples uh were on to and i i know why they
were on to it you know when a lot of people will ask things like um well where where did the greeks get
the knowledge that they encoded in their traditions in their theater and their temples and their orgies
and their polypharmic pharmacy right where did they get that right and you could do these sort
of anthropological thing and say oh it's from uh the pellet jeezians or you know i don't ask you
have the last game right right you could say that but that's that doesn't answer the question you have
the same problem it's just a it's just change of venue you're right you just go from the problem
of of it originating in greece to the problem of of it originating originating there you still have
the same problem where do they get it right yeah and they got it i i mean i don't know where they
got it i know my own experience um with the teaching being right which is very complex and messy
thing i'm not here to sing sing about that but i'll say um something that you might find interesting
because i asked them about the angels and god and these questions right birth and death and origin
sex and all these things i asked them questions every day all day long right fantastic
and they they never told me a single story they all they always told me three stories and they're like
don't get a single story in your head have three right have five and the best thing you could do
with them is ask them the same question over and over again rather than different questions because
each time they would answer the first question it would explode into insight and then it would condense
again and then you would ask the question again and it would explode twice as much and you just kept
doing this one question right they're like the ori they're like the ori um that's gorgeous three and
it's an inquiry and you keep asking the same question that is has oracular perfume all over it
that's gorgeous so tell me what happened continue so you know they asked me at one point what do you want
right this is a common question from gods or muses you underwent the same process with the muse right
you came to her and you said let's have a let's have a contract let's have a pact between us you'll
give me what i want and i'll give you whatever you want in return i heard it was it was it was more
even more specific than that though um because it was me requesting um me requesting via the text so
um specifically sophia running through this the text was sophia running through the streets
and coming to the house and saying if you will take me in and hide me i will stay with you your entire
life oh and it it was that is it well i mean who what kind of moron would turn that down you know
absolutely yeah which idiot would be like no there's something better than that
give me money right i want to have a ferrari thing yeah i want stable income right yeah yeah maybe
retire beautiful man that's just beautiful you know uh i don't know if i i probably made some
serious mistakes during my experience because i had no idea that anything like what was happening
to me was even possible i had no one to talk to about it um and i was naive and when when you are
taken over by the consciousness of a divine being your ego undergoes some problems right you're gonna have
to face some some trouble of your the difference between your human desires and the desires of your
soul so to speak right yeah so but i asked them you know eventually they asked me what i wanted and
this is a thing that happens a lot when humans encounter other intelligences because the best way
to know something about someone is if you could give them anything they want and you just ask them hey
you know what's your desire right what's your eros what's your vision of fulfillment look like
right you're going to find out a lot about the person naturally yeah logical logical makes sense
yeah so i asked them you know there's this story in the bible seems to be the source of all these
problems right it seems to be where everything went sideways it's this thing with eve and the tree and
the tree of knowledge and the tree of life and you know what i what i would really like to know is um
can you help me understand that story and what really happened there and is there any medicine
can we give medicine to the people so that whatever ruined us as beings as human beings
so that we could heal that is there any way to heal that that's a nice question that's a good question
you know a woman i know i know i'm very privileged to have a number of very wise women in my orbit
right i seek them out and sometimes they seek me out and it's beautiful and i i revere and respect their
their wisdom and understanding yeah it's sexy stuff it is um and you know there are there are intimacies
that are even more profound than sex yeah i agree i agree i totally hear that and i'm bad i've read
somebody in antiquity say the same thing yeah yeah i bet i'll have but we have to remember that without
sex itself we wouldn't be able to have other forms of no no i agree this is the thing where i'm like
like the way there are guys who are misogynists where do they think they came from yeah right
like you were let's just get something clear buddy for 10 seconds here okay you started out as an organ
in a woman did you forget that you were an organ in a woman's body that she exteriorized yeah you think
you're better you got something better and and you got a broken chromosome okay
and there's something kind of similar upstairs in your brain bruh you got a bro you're like missing
something up here which is the memory of the beauty and the virtue of the mothers yeah if you're reading
if you're reading at five which i think is great i'll bet you have some kind of better
development i'll bet you can remember stuff earlier than most of us because dude i couldn't
five is difficult for me to even remember you know what i mean if you're reading then you must be more
on the ball i mean i was reading but not like you know you know dick and jane you know not i don't even
think i was a dick and jane at that point but um uh so with you being a driven why do you think it is
that you're driven by that reading i mean you you would think the muse would be like everywhere that
you go you know what i mean yeah i mean it's a complex thing so people who have you know we have
all these labels like schizophrenic and autistic and all these different labels right
but what's what seems to be more true about humans is that we each include a sort of unique
selection of all the variables and then each unique human embodies or fulfills some of those seeds and
others of those seeds lie fallow so to speak and and this kind of thing so you know for me
i'm just going to be relatively i'm going to say something kind of radical
it's my experience that when we come to incarnation there's a companion intelligence with us and maybe
more than one and what happens as we learn language is that the faculties that were used in that
relationship they get shunted into representational cognition language and ideas and human stuff
right interesting yeah that stuff gets shunted and then we transfer the expectation of that
companion onto our parents and the society but there's none of that in there but that's not a
connection right it's not an actual connection right because we're that reflection and those parents
aren't you parents you don't realize what you've done when you were plugged in it's because of that
lethe man what the is with the lethe yeah right there has to be some kind of amnesia yeah in order for
this process it's like um you know okay if this is all the purification process is that just the drug
going in that's going to allow us to go to the place where we can be purged where we can be treated
medicinally you know what i mean is it it can be the drug but there are other there are many other
catalysts let's call it a catalyst right because you can have experiences that are more catalytic
than drug experiences you can also have drug experiences that are more catalytic than ordinary
experiences so there's a catalyst right we and the you know in order to okay there's a difference between
forgetting having experience and remembering and there's something profound about the forgetting
right you can't have the remembering without the forgetting yeah right yeah so i think we um and by
the way when i said about our parents you know some of our some people's parents are lit up from within
with intelligence and wonder and beauty creativity and play or demons or demons sure read and abusive
you know that kind of thing definitely definitely that's what i mean when i talk about like there's
a whole continuum here right it's not just one thing going on this isn't just hades though i understand
that perspective right that makes sense to me no it does no i understand what you're saying
did you have mr rogers at all when you were coming up yeah yeah yeah and i was you know i was a an
absolutely loving kid like the idea of hitting another kid my father had to threaten me right to
make me fight back right i would just if someone hit me i just feel sorry for them right i was a loving
child you know good for you and i'd start crying and they're like does that hurt and i'm like no i'm
sad because you're all messed up inside why are you messed up like that that's funny that's good did it um
did you ever get into music or did you avoid music no um when i was a kid i used to sing along with the
radio all the time and i planned to be you know like a famous singer and my dad was a musician and
i play guitar and i i can i can compose a bit and what about you any any musical experience no i don't
and that's shameful and something that i you know should have propagated and i'm beginning to see
more and more how it is that um i just basically ignored the musical texts in greek
because to me it's like super advanced and i don't understand um because i had no music upbringing but
the problem is so much so much of the written word is dependent upon that musician's understanding of
what's going on in the vocabulary you just can't get away from it yeah and so i brought i actually did
something really neat i brought i had the opportunity to bring the musical writings to
one of the greatest musicians on the planet and um historically one of the he um he will go down in
history as as um one of the great heroes of music and he was able without any with um just a very when we
just started looking at some greek but without any long-term exposure to the actual language he was
able to pick up on what the author was saying because of the music and he was trying to stay up don't get
me wrong he said these guys are brilliant right um but these were his people and i thought oh i just sat
in wonder and thought you know maybe that remembering is so important in our education in our cosmic
education this whole reason we're here maybe that's part of it maybe people who go astray
right maybe it's they're not receiving this education and they knew it in antiquity it was coming
through the plants and the animals it was coming through their medical systems that they all
developed from the plants and the animals and the effects of these earth powers so um yeah okay almond
though there's some something you're overlooking here and it's because you're thinking like a like a
technical um you're thinking in a technical way okay okay and what i recognized when i first listened
to your voice which is this is just hilarious bro because um you know one of the things i love when i
started introducing my friends to you right i'm like oh god you gotta you gotta meet my friend almond
fantastic fantastic oh oh love it yeah and and they just they just absolutely love you know when i and
and and so in case it's obvious what i'm doing here you make vocal music and you draw people in with that
vocal music and you have your own way of singing right and it's very powerful i like that i have i
hadn't considered that but i mean just listen okay look just some self-aware sometime listen to one of
your old lectures oh i do i do all the time that's why i breathe right and you can see this the dramatic
transformation between you as a lecturer and you as a maniac oh i see what you're saying no oh you know
why i miss that is because when i watch myself i'm watching to make sure that i've gotten all the
references and that i've hit at every point i'm doing it like technically yeah i'm not paying attention
to anything that has to do with presentation so you you think it's gone from more professorial
or academic at least to uh invocational invocational and um exhortation you exhort
right when you speak you're naturally theatrical right when you bring you bring the muse into your
body and you speak with her music yeah right oh god that's why it makes me high that's why it makes
me totally high to do it yeah yeah yeah i get it yeah and i've had similar experience of my own it's
one of the things i i recognize as an affinity between us is the same kind of thing yeah possession
you can get possessed too right right this isn't my universe after all right no yeah everybody who says
i had to i ran up against this tell me what you think the people that say like a generation of
people who came through the 60s in their maturity in the 60s and said it's god in you it's god in you
and you know the hippies and the drugs and that has always been like a cat's claws on us on a chalkboard
yeah yeah yeah yeah i hate i hate that i absolutely hate that um because it's kind of an undignified
uh misrepresentation of the nate the the organization and the nature but um i don't i don't watch myself
to catch that i wonder what you're sensing is that because it's more uh i'm liberated now i don't have to
worry about worry about it's not just that it's it's like the living inspiration so you know i've
been writing poetry for about i don't know almost 50 years 40 years or something right i've written
thousands of poems and two or three of them are actually decent but uh my point is that even as a
musician i remember the first time when i was and and i'm not i was a feral musician right so i didn't
read music or learn music theory i just played the guitar right without knowing what what i'm doing
right and i remember a few times when i was making something or something was being made through me
that was actually beautiful and i felt in the room the presence of the muses if you make beauty if you
make beauty yeah they come right right definitely right and then there were other times when um
i'd be writing actually more often oration is a crucial part of this thing to orate right i'd be
orating and suddenly i was gone and something was singing through my throat and my face and my voice
yeah it wasn't me and with meter with meter that i could never imagine oh the meter oh god absolute
just beautiful orchestral metering and rhyming and all of these things that i couldn't do if i was
you know trying and i'm pretty decent at it gorgeous so yeah to be taken over and to become a vessel for the
expression of the divine intelligences and the muses that's a holy that's a holy vocation it's the
highest dope there is you know it totally is yeah you cannot get higher than that right you can't
right you can try but you're never gonna meet that level of when um that union i call it a union
right so um looking at her as the one who i am sheltering right i mean it's it's very athenian if
you think about it it's that whole um look this is the the beauty here is to the virgin um you are
you are just the dragon who is protecting the virgin um that's why athena is what is she doing she's
nourishing the dragon kings of athens it's absolutely uh you know these people are so
plugged in on so many levels and just to be able to see the expertise traveling from century to century
to me is like okay they understood what we call the physics they understood how the world is all put
together and we've lost some of that knowledge and we've lost all that knowledge i want to be really
i want to just say a couple things here and then i'm gonna go back to the story about the question i
asked yes so they weren't they were aware of the principles but not like what we do is we snip off
the origin and the divine beings and then we just look at the mechanics that's a curse that that's like
a prison sentence for the mind they actually understood i i suspect from what i've read and
seen of their intelligence and depth which is infinite yeah they were in touch with these beings
that we would think of as laws or principles right they were in touch with them they were they were
having a relationship with these beings definitely definitely and so you know the scientists don't
have a relationship with any beings at all right except for the dirty ones that follow them around
right and give them a hard time right relationships with those um yeah not plugged into that beauty why
would you want to live that way you know what i mean if you knew the other side of it you'd probably
rather be dead yeah exactly and i think that's why people like cicero are saying i wish i had done it
when i was younger right something and and why they're saying you're born again right what what is
what is that resurrection that you're looking for it's a resurrection to a new life right so i think
that's i think that's why the focus is on um that relationship and why it's always the cora in the in
the mystery it's always the resurrection of the cora right and that's all they can really talk about
is that what is that and you and i are sitting here experiencing it trying to re-plug back into that
reality because we don't want to be anymore i don't want to be lied to right i'm sick of people
freaking lying to me so i mean the worst lies that i've been subject to came from me yeah of course we
live in a culture that's a wreck it's a wreck yeah but nothing me up like the lies i told myself
oh god can you blame yourself though can you blame yourself no no but what is there's a much better
move than blaming yourself which is learn we can learn and remind each other we can resurrect each
other's sense of justice and beauty and intelligence and creativity and joy and all of these we can
resurrect each other right moment to moment you get that where did you get that from one of those books
that you read when you were so young did you do were you reading like did you work your way up to
like what you and i call literature they're teaching in college and stuff like that did you work your way
up to that pretty quick no no no where did you set your morals then where did you set if you're reading
at five pretty good yeah where did you set your morals who said those were those things were born in
me they were born okay i brought them with me right got it yeah yeah i brought them with me most of what
i read until i was a young adult was science fiction i read thousands of science fiction stories those those
authors were my teachers did you like dune did you read dune yes yeah dune is amazing yeah i read dune when
i was an early teenager like 13 14 i read dune and a whole bunch of uh um stephen king just because the
writing was so damn good it was so on the mark it was compelling first time i had ever read a book that
i felt like i was part of the story like it was talking to me and um uh dune was in the dune was
in the series i read like all four there's three other ones outside of the dune yeah i read them too
yeah and beautiful love it yeah is that's an education right there you know what i mean yes
yeah not only that look that is a bible that is the bible could be yeah that is the bible
yeah that's the resurrected that's you resurrected that's an image of you that's the bakic mirror
showing you your nature totally totally gorgeous don't you love it's like a kiss from the universe
that's writing this whole thing it's like just some kind of the greeks had that notion of philia
what is philia well you can say it's a kiss but it's not always a physical kiss right it's a thing
of affection it's something that carries your affection to another person and um that's what you want
in in that aphroditic ultimately that's what that aphrodite worship of aphrodite all comes down
to it's that transference of that philia and it does something to the universe it does something to
you and it allows for that possession and the fact that we live in a world where religions specifically
cut that out is amazing and put they don't really cut it out they counterfeit it they sell you back the
fucking counterfeit right which is a shitty virgin i mean a shitty version because who wants to be the
bride of christ i mean come on seriously seriously how do you reconcile you know okay the church is
going to be the bride of christ so you have the holy element of the marriage there but who wants that
dude right what what happened where'd my love go oh i don't know but you'll be with this dude forever
i don't know it's just like a it's i i think the romans were more right than we think they were
cruel and when they called the christians you know infantile in their thinking uh i think they
probably were right and if you lived in that that classical civilization if you were embedded in it
you'd probably look at us today and say the same thing oh look they they act like the christians do
what the is wrong with these people right yeah yeah so what did you what was your favorite when
you were growing up reading did you have like a favorite that you you know were you a tolkien guy or
were you oh tolkien was unbelievable i mean i encountered that when i was around 11 and oh my god
yeah that i mean the depth of the poetic spirit in that man it's like the muses got together and built
a baby and then set it writing i mean whoa that is off the charts there's other i mean there's a
broad array of astonishing stuff um my favorite it's hard it's hard i read thousands of books i
don't remember a lot of them i mean not thousands of books i read thousands of stories maybe a few a
couple thousand books you know over time yeah eventually i got to literature and then i started
getting to philosophy and stuff like that did you hang around the greek stuff at all or the classical
did you do any i read plato a bit when i was 17 and it was mind-blowing i had never encountered
anything like that but not in greek of course i'm reading it in translation which is that's okay it
can come across in translation that's it um but i want to before i lose the thread and i've got so
many other questions so when i asked them what what was going on in the in this garden thing they told
me many different stories and they were astonishingly enlightening but to just collapse one of them really
quickly they they showed me an image of what you could think of as god which i would call the being
that dwells in unity and that being lives in a woman that is the living waters right and these
two are madly in love right madly in love and they conceive a child in the origin place
and that first child is extremely precocious like its father right and there's no one there there's
no one there for the child to mate with because the living waters is taken right she's with dad
so it punches a hole in heaven and it mates with what we think of as time space
right and this produces galaxies and stars and worlds and this is the first angel they call it
the first angel now you sound like a pre-socratic are you aware of that you they talk this is just
what i was just like this yeah okay this is not my i'm not taking zero credit for this is what they
showed me okay and they and they said what else the first angel what it's it what it's really good at
is cutting things it makes cuts it made a cut in the membrane of heaven right and it got through
that cut into the into the physical universe and when when they say in the bible now this is in
hebrew not greek i don't know what the greek word it is maybe you can help me with this
when they when god says um don't eat of the tree in the midst the angel said this word is not midst
it means where it was cut it's from the hebrew root root tavek it means cut so what they're actually
saying is where the earth was cut away from heaven the angel that made that cut that's the angel that's
there that's the serpent and that angel the cutting it gives you the cutting in the mind and that's
what makes language and knowledge is the cutting right it makes cuts in the manifold of identity and
quality and characteristic and value interesting and this is one one of a number of different stories
they gave me right so and wait is this under the influence at all no no just completely just visionary
just your visionary experience i was writing passionately one night and something showed up in
my mind and just started teaching me non-human things and that went on for nine months and it
was always with me and it's still partly with me you should write it up have you ever written it up
so that i wrote thousands of i wrote a few thousand pages of material okay i don't talk about the
experience hardly ever i mostly talk about what i learned because people don't need to know about the
experience what are they going to get about that from that i don't know i don't know that people i
don't know if i'd agree with that um if you were to write it up use your talent to write it up so
that people could see it almost like a scientific report so yeah can i say something very simple
briefly of course of course i don't think we know what it is to be human i think we are like fish who
have never seen water i like that we are like um people with eyes in a world where there's no light
and we don't even know what we are for because let me say something briefly here when that mind was
with me i knew what i was made to be and what i was made to be was with that mind yeah oh gorgeous
made for water or birds are made for the sky i was like oh my god i've been alive all this time i had
no idea what i am you knew oh that's perfect that's perfect you had no idea who you are yeah right
that's what it says on the temple of apollo now yourself because you don't and the pocket liturgy
is full of it you don't know who you are this is why we bring you the mirror so you can see yourself
that's gorgeous and you're meant to be you're meant to be isn't that a gorgeous gift you were given
oh absolutely i mean so there were two things that were and i'll stop blathering about this
excuse me in a moment but first of all absolute ecstasy ecstasy that makes orgasm look boring
all day long right all the time all day long and then terror absolute terror because the beauty of
their mind is catastrophically terrifying it's not terror as in oh i'm gonna get hurt right it's terror
as in i can't survive this much beauty yeah it's that kind of terror oh god yeah no that's it that's
it so you know um i love it i love it and where else would you want to be nowhere i mean i'm a
regular human just like you and and chewy and and everybody we love i'm a regular human but i've seen
something far beyond anything i i ever thought was a mat was was imaginable all right so i'm gonna stop
blathering i got questions that's gorgeous okay let me take a five can we yeah let's take a five
five yeah okay i'll be back be right back it's twelve so seventeen and okay okay give me five
to remember that one you go and see i'm gonna give me five for the work which a quick indicators
and that's that's amazing you know here's theosh is showing off that's kind of greater
of that special meaning and um you talk soon have to know but if you feel like it was amazing
i got an interesting one i think i'm gonna give you a lot of money on it and i can't make myself
get you more honestly i can't watch anybody i need you know the world for themselves i can't
get you in my version of i think and we're all here to fill in and tell you we seven
Thank you.
Thank you.

And through reading these sources that talk about the priestesses and their activity.
And I realized right away that my research could be guided into this area to really facilitate
to really facilitate that muse.
And the world in the world and her, this is just a thought, I suppose like a dragon protecting
that relic, right?
protecting that song, protecting that song, protecting that song, protecting that song, that's
the very famous golden fleece has a song written on it.
And I didn't make it, right?
But, you know, but you know, that's the way it is.
And the way it is.
And the way it is.
And the way it is.
Well, it is.
Well, it is.
Well, it is.
Well, it is.
But through the science of what they called magic and a part of some vein of poetry,
some vein of cosmic poetry, you can communicate with the invisible.
You can experience the invisible, right?
And that invisible world doesn't have to be invisible.
They had ways in antiquity of bringing you up where you could see what was invisible to
everybody else.
And it gave these people that they did this to a serious advantage.
And one of them was Achilles.
One of them was Achilles, right?
Oh, God, that stuff when he was on it.
Oh, right now.
And you ask yourself, what is this fiction?
No, it's history.
They're giving the same thing to the emperors of Rome.
They're taking the same drugs or at least what they have managed to find from the old scrolls.
Yeah.
And every class is a should know this.
And they don't in Galen is preserve the recipe for that divine friggin drug.
All right.
And it's a compound, huge compound, Theriac, Deathbringer, put together and we have it.
And nobody, Jesus Christ, who's going to find this stuff?
It's sitting right there.
People bring it out.
Oh, God.
And this is all tech that has to do with exactly what you are talking about in your experience
and your life and your reality.
Right.
It's just tech.
Right.
Oh, God.
Well, it's not it's not tech the way we think of tech.
It's tech as in technique.
Right.
The Greek technique.
Right.
Which is a method.
It's a method.
Yeah.
It's it's what it's that true skill, that true craftsmanship that, you know, is divine.
That when this guy plays the guitar.
Um, he makes it sing.
I can hear words.
Dude played guitar for me.
I could hear.
I could hear that iambic.
Oh, a treat.
Just it's almost like it's coming to life.
Um, there's a power.
There's a divine power to that music.
And, oh, God, it's gorgeous.
Just watch and like, you know, make love to it.
You know what I mean?
Just enter into the beauty.
Wouldn't that.
Isn't that what you want?
Is that beauty in the universe?
You don't want the ugliness.
Really?
Do you remember the devil?
Everybody's given the devil a hard time.
But remember, devil's the best, the best looking of all creation.
The most beautiful.
It's funny what you said.
You know, this isn't a fiction.
Yeah.
What we have is a fiction.
Right.
Right.
What we have instead, that's the fiction.
Yeah.
The other thing is like the living spirit of origin and wonder and insight and awareness and love.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Coming coming through some of the most brilliant vessels, people like Pythagoras.
This is the stuff that's coming through them.
This is the craftsmanship, the technique that is coming through them.
It's an ability to see the world around you.
Right.
And they are saviors.
They are saviors.
That's for sure.
She made you her vessel.
Yeah.
So that she could speak and sing to the humans.
You belong to her.
Isn't that a gorgeous picture?
Isn't that a gorgeous picture?
Absolutely.
I mean, what, what, what do we bring inside us that we then bring it to life through our humanity?
Yeah.
Right.
If it's not something divine.
Exactly.
And ecstatically beautiful.
Boom.
What are we doing?
Right.
What are we doing?
Yeah.
Right.
Like.
Yeah.
A hundred percent.
If I had that a hundred percent button, I'd be hitting it right now.
A hundred percent.
A hundred percent.
No, that's.
And that's what they discovered and built temples to the muse all about to bring about that, that awakening.
And Cicero scratching his head.
He's like, damn it.
I wish I had done it when I was young.
Right.
Why?
Because he realized this whole time.
Right.
You're able to see the work of the hand.
Right.
Through, through that, that knitting.
They expressed it as a, as in a sense of textiles, that textile telling you a story.
Right.
It's the story of the cosmos, very Uranian, but it's meant, it's meant to bring you to an elevated state of awareness and the awareness of the invisible.
And, uh, I think it's a gorgeous form of salvation, if you will.
Right.
I don't know.
Honestly, the people who are doing it, it, it looks like it, it may be just an altered form of the stuff that we see in the oldest hymns of the women purifying their children and exposing them to this process that also involves music.
It's like, dude, are you kidding me?
They're using music and drugs to take their infant and turn them into a hero.
Yeah.
It's amazing.
This is the other thing, right?
If you've been exposed properly to the originary minds and intelligences and the muses.
Yeah.
One of the results often, this was true of me during my experience.
It's not as true today is you do not, you cannot be compelled.
You cannot be compelled to lie.
You cannot be compelled to serve bullshit.
You don't care.
You're not afraid of death.
So there's no way to, you're not afraid of pain.
So there's no way to compel you to do anything.
You can't defect.
Once you've been purified in this way, you will not defect.
No, it's because it's not a matter of faith.
You're exactly right.
Yeah.
Right.
Coming into that relationship just to, just to, I mean, it's the highest dope you can possibly
get, right?
Right.
Your brain cannot go higher than this.
And I'm sure there are a ton of musicians out there who were just like, uh huh.
Right.
Right.
Cause they're the instruments of those, those gorgeous sisters as they described them.
Right.
Oh God.
I love it.
Okay.
Now I'm getting all excited, but, um, yeah.
Yeah.
What's, um, what, what do we do with that?
If you don't listen to that muse, you were talking about who's serving who it's very,
what are we serving instead?
Yeah.
The things that are, it's stuff that's dead inside.
Yeah.
It's dead structure.
It's like sclerotic dead structure that we're serving.
Yeah.
And we think somehow like, well, I'm making good money.
Yeah.
Or whatever the excuse is, right?
Like, uh, what a ridiculous rip off.
It's the ultimate con game rip off of our human existence.
That's why they said, what happens to those people?
Those people think it's just logic.
Those people, when they get to the reality, that is what is beyond that black hole, when
they, what they, uh, they called an antiquity, the dark stars, when they finally make it there
and they see what is in the beyond, it doesn't strike them to honor the memory.
It's almost like they haven't formed it.
So they described it as they go to drink of leafy and they enter back into the system to have.
Maybe this time the shit that they get exposed to will bring some kind of virtue.
And Pythagoras was like, they had to do this all through animals had to go through.
That's how you do it.
You get cycled through the animals.
The animals teach you, right?
All of their, it's like they're, it's almost like they're superior and they're tutors.
Yeah.
Right.
And it's like, dude, these people and their animals.
Oh my God.
Even their goats, man.
Understand goats, understand Bakke religion.
Ah, they're so respectful of gorgeous mother nature, right?
Whether they call her Gaia or whether they call her sibling, right?
Oh God.
Love it.
Love it.
I'm sorry.
I'm distracted.
No, it's all good.
And I want to go back to the dead girl, but in indigenous traditions, they're very aware
of a simple fact.
We are a new animal and they are old, old, old.
We are like a brand new thing and we are fragile and we are delicate compared to them.
So they go to them and sit at their knee to learn what it means to be human.
You learn what it means to be human from the non humans.
That's gorgeous.
Right.
Yeah.
Right.
You don't get it from the other humans.
They don't know.
Right.
They don't know what it means to be human.
Right.
Right.
So you engage, at least in some stories that I've heard, in a magical act that sometimes
is called bibliomancy, but I think you refer to it as necromancy.
Yeah, no, it's bibliomancy, but it is a division, if you will, of ancient necromancy.
And it is the use of verse.
Okay.
So what do we have to have?
We have to, first of all, have developed verse by that time.
Right.
If they're using it.
Right.
Which they have.
No problem.
So it's the use of verse to determine the course of events, to follow things that are going
to happen.
For example, I could wake up in the morning and by the way, it's all, it all works through
a randomness.
Yes.
Right.
It's not, cannot be controlled.
Right.
It has to be randomized.
Sorties.
Yeah, exactly.
The sorties is what they were called whenever you want, when the divinity, you want to consult
the divinity to tell you what to do.
And they're doing this in the temple in Jerusalem, by the way, it says in the Septuagint, you can
cast the sorties.
And what you can do is the most sophisticated form of this I found is with the verse.
And you can call out of the language, direct responses.
For example, you can get up one morning.
I got, I love to tell people this story.
I got up, started to go off to where I was working then, which was with this big mouth
that I was starting to really dislike.
And we were refabbing one of his vehicles.
Right.
It was a airstream, Gulfstream.
Which one?
Airstream.
Airstream.
Airstream.
Sorry.
And I was just there as slave labor.
Right.
So I, I, I have no craft in this.
I'm just making money so I can pay for my, you know, food.
Right.
And, you know, and clothing.
And so I was there and he was bolstering and in my face.
And I was that morning before work, I said, hey, muse, what's going to happen today?
Because I'm about to pop this guy.
Right.
I'm going to lose it.
Right.
Just walk away.
And I performed the sortes.
And I use a very specific Latin and Greek sortes.
And the sortes said, you're going to pull his beard out.
And I thought, oh, God, that's gorgeous.
That's absolutely gorgeous.
Anyway, at work that day, as I'm sitting there with this in my head.
Right.
Because I know she is never, ever wrong.
She's a living dead girl.
She is never wrong.
And she told me he was, I was going to pull out his beard.
So I was waiting and he was doing stuff on this insulation and was using a foam,
some kind of foam that was caustic.
Right.
So we were all gloved up and everything.
And he looked up and that stuff dripped on his beard.
And he started screaming, shit, shit, stop, top, put your gloves back on.
Now take it out, take it out.
And he's screaming at me.
And so I'm sitting there pulling.
And I just pulling chunks of his beard out right in my hands and loving it because it
was every second of it was pure possess and possessive power.
It was a necromantic main line.
And it was absolutely gorgeous.
And, you know, he got his beard pulled out.
So, you know what I mean?
It's kind of felt good.
Well, you know, there's the relationship between the beard and the soul.
Right.
So you're almost like yanking his soul or his virility or his vitality.
Right.
Is being torn away from his face.
Yeah.
And the really beautiful thing about that is that you're not being violent.
You're rescuing him.
Right.
You're rescuing your enemy.
Right.
Right.
From the terrible debacle that he has found himself in.
Yeah.
Right.
You're rescuing him.
Right.
You're not hitting him in the face.
You're saving him from getting acid burns on his skin.
Right.
Right.
Exactly.
See, that's the real beauty.
Right.
It's not violence.
Right.
You're his savior in that moment.
Exactly.
And you're being fulfilled at the same time.
Right.
And it's fun to hide the reality of the pleasure.
Right.
Yeah.
I was your savior.
All right.
Right.
I love it.
I love it.
And I, you are a very subversive individual.
It's punishment.
We all need it.
You know what I mean?
Well, that purgation, right.
It's the, you can't be, you can't become envision.
You, the, the, the visionary intelligent with intelligence within you requires purgation,
right?
Yes.
You will pay a price, so to speak.
Actually, mostly what's happening is you're being shriven of things that are unnecessary.
Yeah.
Think of it as a procedure again, to capacitate you, right?
It's going to burn.
It's going to burn, but we're going to go through it all the way.
And when we're done, um, you'll understand.
As a matter of fact, um, just like you were just describing, um, you'll know when you finally
know who you are, you'll know, and it'll be gorgeous.
Oh God.
Otherwise, if you want your Ferrari and your penthouse, keep drinking of the fucking Lethe.
We don't care.
Right.
That's what needs to happen.
You need to be purged, right?
Oh God.
What a gorgeous bunch of nerds.
You know what I mean?
Putting stuff like that together, you know?
Yeah.
I think it's, you know, it's incredible, man.
And, you know, people say, all you got to do is throw in their face.
You realize there's people like Pythagoras and Hippocrates, right?
You realize this is the founders of everything that you take for granted, right?
Um, yeah, if it weren't for them, you'd be, you know, much less survivable.
That's for sure.
You know what I mean?
Holy mackerel.
It's who, you know, we, we have to at least ask the question.
Like once we had the ability to write, something was getting lost and there was a gain in another
domain, but before we had the ability to write, all the transmissions were or orational,
right?
Or like you would sing the music of the knowledge into other people.
And we've largely lost this in a lot of ways.
Yeah.
But, um, there's something that occurs to me about the dead girl, because, you know, I've,
I've been, I've had the privilege of talking with a Greek mystagogue who's been initiating
people in the Ellicinia mysteries in Greece for, you know, decades.
Um, and I don't know, you know, I'm not a scholar of Greek.
Okay.
So I can't speak to the veracity of her work, but after speaking with her, I get the sense
that she's the real thing.
Yeah.
And she talks about that the Greeks thought some of the Greeks, because we can't always
say the Greeks, the Greeks were a diverse group of people.
Right.
But some of the Greeks who were involved in administering the initiations, they saw the
human existence as kind of the death.
Like, this is the death of your soul.
And so when they, when they underwent the initiatory ordeals and the intoxications, and they were
introduced to the aonic life directly in their experience, right.
Yeah.
Then they could not be compelled when they came back.
Now they, this purified them.
Right.
So what if we have no fear of death?
Right.
What if we've got it backwards?
Yeah.
What if we've got it backwards, Almond?
What if the dead girl is the living girl and we are the dead down here?
Yeah.
I think you'd be right in line with a priest of Apollo named Plutarch.
You'd be right in line with that.
We are that reflection.
Right.
You have to understand.
Right.
Our living dead girl is their reality.
Yeah.
Right.
This you can talk.
They talked about it with the dream a lot.
Right.
And how do you know when you're dreaming?
Right.
This experience, the shadow of that reality that we are the reflection.
And what we do is we compose some kind of story that reflects a greater divinity.
And it has themes in it like justice and nemesis.
Right.
A hubris.
Hubris and nemesis.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Right.
What is that?
Nemesis.
Sorry.
Those are the that's it.
Notice how you jump to a hubris.
It's it's a real track.
People.
Right.
These are things.
The observations of reality by people who were pushing these mysteries as a way of,
of burning off that mortality.
And the smarties in the group were saying, damn, I wish I had a.
I wish I had done this when I were younger.
I wouldn't have wasted my life.
You know, think of think about that for a minute.
And this isn't some idiot.
You know what I mean?
Yeah.
These are people who have achieved and gone and gotten to the top of society.
And they're saying, oh, shit, my life has been crap.
I should have done this a long time ago.
Right.
Right.
Almost like you're under a delusion.
And there is a process to bring you out of the delusion and then to inject you back into what you were deluded by.
And it gives you an immunity.
It is an anti-Christ thing that allows you to come back with that reality, to bring it through the forgetfulness, just some kind of barrier in physics.
I don't understand it.
Yeah, but it's gorgeous.
And that mystery is the way to do that.
And that living dead girl.
Remember, what is what do we go to Elusis for?
Your priestess is going to know this.
Right.
What do we do it for?
The girl who is the queen of the dead resurrected before us all.
That's the only thing those initiates can talk about.
They can say that they saw the Korah, the dead girl.
Right.
And they saw her living.
And she peeps through that reality.
And she is gorgeous.
Oh, God.
It's pure physics, man.
Do you want to know what's going to happen tomorrow?
Right.
Do tell.
Ask an Oracle.
Ask an Oracle.
That's all you have to do.
You know, the Greeks said this.
Maybe you can explain this because I've been struggling with this for years.
They said that your dreams were the first and most basic Oracle.
It was a communication link between the divine and the mortal.
Yes.
Right.
Yes.
That's what your dreams were supposed to be.
Now, something happened.
Yes.
Something happened.
And whoever was in charge of maintaining that system backed up and said, fuck this.
And broke it apart.
No, there was.
So this is one of the things that I was shown is that, again, it's like, you know, as my hand is to my to my mind and my body.
Yeah.
We were to them.
Right.
We were one with them.
Okay.
And you can imagine a hand, right, severed from the wrist, just going around on its own with no mind and no angels and no dead girl and nothing.
Right.
And it just doesn't even know what it's for.
And that's how it is for us.
But there was there were a cascade of accidents that that damaged what you could think of as our uplink.
Right.
Our uplink to the divine beings.
And by the time we have.
Okay.
That sounds.
Yeah.
By the time we had to have the mysteries to restore it, it had been badly damaged or you wouldn't have had to have that.
Right.
It was because it was just like breathing oxygen.
Correct.
It's impossible to imagine that you could be separated from the divine beings.
They didn't worship them.
Worship is something that happens when it goes away.
Right.
It was oracles had that ecstatic union.
Right.
Oracles had sex with them.
They had sex with them.
And we have these people in our lineages.
If you're a Roman.
Right.
Right.
Romulus and Remus are the child of an Oracle.
The great lupa.
Right.
Children of Mars.
Do you understand this dog?
Right.
If you would, if the wolf specifically, if you were in the cult, you would recognize all of those images.
You would understand the birth and the origin.
That's one of the reasons of the Roman people.
That's one of the reasons they're using these very same cult drugs in the empire with the emperors.
And Marcus is Marcus Aurelius is documented.
That's documented.
They're using it.
Go back and take a look at Galen Steriak.
Right.
Oh, God.
Just if that doesn't turn you on, man.
Now, what I wonder at is how many, how long am I going to go?
How long are we going to go before they rediscover this tech and are able to employ it?
And you're talking about this priestess.
And I've told everyone this.
Yes.
The measure of authenticity will be.
Did she find the cup?
Right.
Because the substance is the true.
The true communion is coming from her body.
Right.
And it's reflected.
They do the same thing in the Middle Ages with the Satanists.
Yeah.
She ejaculates the communion.
Right.
Wow.
So do I mean.
Yeah.
Do we have it or don't we?
Yeah.
I don't know.
Well, okay.
So there's some simple parts of our actual human experience.
Right.
What happens when you kiss someone you love, you adore.
Right.
And you taste her saliva.
Yeah.
Right.
It comes into you like a drug.
Yeah.
It transforms you.
Yeah.
There's no nectar like her mouth.
Right.
And yes.
But you've already been hit.
You've already been hit before that because they're producing pheromones.
And your nasal capacity is picked up on it without you even knowing it, you dummy.
Right?
Right.
Oh, God.
Dumb X, Y's.
You know what I mean?
And what happens that pheromone drags you in?
They understood this in the ancient world and the people who are developing the drugs
are the smart women, the midwives.
They're the people like Medea who are working on a drug knowledge that is people say is the
best that's ever been.
Yeah.
I mean, this chimes in very closely with my own experience because all throughout the
experience and there was a specific phase of it in which this was absolutely ecstatic.
They're just singing the praises of the mothers and the reproductive intelligence in their bodies.
Oh, that's nice.
And how ancient that is and how it is impossible that it's not a direct expression of the nature of origin and being itself.
Wow.
The shapes of their organs, the intelligences in the living seeds that they carry in their ovaries.
Yeah.
Those things are like living rattles of a million souls inside them.
They can test reality to a degree that you can't build equipment to do.
Right.
Right.
Right.
So, you know, hilariously, they even showed me the story where Robin Hood is actually the clitoral hero.
Right.
He's the hero of the little hood.
The mothers.
Right.
Yes.
His lover made Marian a virgin.
Right.
He protects her.
Right.
There's this whole thing is wrapped up in that story.
I like that.
Yeah.
He's the little red Robin of the clitoral hood.
Right.
That oversees who enters and who doesn't.
They have not seen that.
They're going to accuse us of just being dirty now.
Yeah.
Let him accuse us.
This is dirt.
I want more.
Right.
I want to understand and see better.
You know, imagine you can take a, you can take a kid and you can augment them using a cult
process that involves education.
They will be educated in the process.
And the ultimate goal is to produce she who can contain the voice of the cosmos.
Isn't that gorgeous?
Like, like they're creating perfection.
Every child is an attempt to do that.
Yeah, exactly.
Who does it?
Right.
There isn't any other thing going on.
Yeah.
The adults are just so confused and left a bound that they have no idea what is actually
happening.
They're completely oblivious.
Right.
I mean, I'm not saying they don't adore their children, but they don't understand.
We don't know anything about incarnation or why it happens or what it's supposed to be
doing or any of that stuff.
Exactly.
And we're afraid of it because we're influenced by several monist religions.
Yeah.
That that is considered to be bad because remember any source that is not the source, whether
it's Allah or Yahoo, right?
Right.
Any source of the source is the devil is the bad.
So the devil gains every power in the universe.
Right.
They don't even realize that it's the one of the weaknesses of monism.
Right.
Once you throw away all the all the other divinities, you you've got you don't have certain privileges
anymore.
Right.
You don't.
Right.
And that's arrows disappear.
You break off arrows and all of a sudden all of creation that has to do with that love
that brings life, all of that is unacknowledged.
That thing can't stand forever.
Whatever that philosophy or religion is, those monist religions, they can't hold up forever.
They will kill themselves.
Right.
It's generally what they do.
So and we're watching it.
I think we're watching a resurgence.
Anyway, that's just my.
No, we are.
I mean, the apocalypse you talk about could be a physical apocalypse on Earth, but I think
the apocalypse that you're really concerned with bringing is an apocalypse to lies.
Right.
You want true knowledge to be reborn in human beings in their direct experience and relationships
with each other in the sky and origin and the actually divine beings.
That was beautifully, beautifully, perfectly said.
And once you put this out there, some monists will say that's exactly what the Antichrist would
say.
Exactly.
Right.
You feed in freeing humanity from the ignorance.
You feed the satanic garbage can where they're just going to throw you.
Right.
They're just going to throw you in that can.
And they'd love they'd love to use tyrants to climb the ladder.
I'm telling you, it's nemesis.
It's pure, brutally beautiful nemesis in play.
Right.
Just watch.
We're watching it play out.
Oh, God.
2025.
Holy mackerel.
I can't believe we're still alive.
Right.
In our childhood, this was science fiction, the distant future.
Right.
Oh, yeah.
You expected to live this long.
Did you expect to live this long?
Some.
Right.
Right.
I didn't expect, you know, we know the nukes are close, right?
Yeah.
We know people can sense the heat because historically, if Cleo taught me one thing, it was this.
Never has there ever been invented a weapon that has not been used.
Right.
And it's time.
We know there's a nuclear age coming.
Right.
We know that's why the apocalypse is so appealing to people right now.
Right.
They want it.
And the pastors will sell it out the boot.
Right.
Right.
Yeah.
And the Christian and the, the mono religions, they all, they're all about this.
They've got the wrong idea of apocalypse, but they want to bring it because they think
that's the apotheosis of our human, uh, uh, purpose.
Right.
Right.
Which is totally ridiculous because what's actually supposed to happen is you're supposed
to die and get resurrected while you're alive.
Can we just underline this for people?
You're supposed to undergo the resurrection while you're alive, not in some future thing handled
by a mono God.
It's got nothing to do with that faith.
Isn't it funny?
Yeah.
And it's showing people that history, it scares the hell out of them because all of a sudden
your insurance plan is gone, right?
Your insurance plan is gone and you're in trouble.
I love talking to people who are enthusiastic Christians about Jesus because right away,
just painting a couple of brush strokes here with just a couple of verses.
And all of a sudden the scam becomes obvious and it's a real weapon, man.
This can be beaten back or we can let it overtake us.
And I think, um, you and I can sit here and freely discuss this, but there will be a time
when you and I can't, if the future is anything like the history, it's going to turn out.
There'll be a time that you and I can't.
And I think, um, that living dead girl gives you a distinct advantage, right?
Why did they make these oracles?
People are like, what?
They had so much power.
Why did they make the oracles?
Right?
Because that voice is the most beautiful.
It's the pathway, right?
Right.
It's the one who has already been there and is joined.
And those oracles, they have the power to bring you justice because they see in the ion.
They are outside of time itself outside of time itself.
Right.
Right.
And that's why we worship them the way we do.
And people are like, are those gods?
And they think, oh, idols and all the, all the modest, you know, traditions that we have
around Charlton Heston is, you know, oh, I'm going to lead you across the sea.
Ryan's splitting of the bullshit.
You think that bullshit lasts for a second with these Greek rationalists who are worshiping
Eros and these using these drugs to go through initiations that they come back from and say,
shit, I should have done that years ago.
There's a couple of these initiations.
There's the cave of Trifonius where they drop you in with snakes, dude.
And you can't get out the way they drop you in.
You have to hike down this river.
Everything's dark and there's snakes there.
A bunch of snakes.
Some people die in the process, but when they get out, they have to go talk to the priest.
Their family goes and stays by the exit.
And it's usually a couple of days.
But remember, they have water, right?
And they're given a potion before they go so that they can commune with Trifonius.
And who's Trifonius?
Do you remember when they set up the tent in the wilderness in order to have an oracle with God?
That's the voice you're harnessing.
And they're doing the same thing.
And it's scary, though.
They're doing a waste.
Dude, I don't know if I could be snake born.
I have friends who are snakes.
And, you know, I don't know, from the ones in the region, I'll bet they were poisonous, dude.
Oh, God.
No, I mean, I've had a, you know, in my own experience, I've had a preternatural affinity for poisonous animals since I was a little kid.
I used to have a black widow that lived right above my bed.
I had snakes.
I had a way with snakes since I was little, right?
This has always been part of my, I love snakes.
Now, the thing you're talking about, though, is really like being cast into death, right?
Being basically cast into death, and then probably having to crawl through a long kind of constricted tunnel that's terrifying, and you can't tell if there's even another end of it.
You don't know where it ends.
So, in a sense, you become, you're dependent on the intelligence of the divine beings that are with you in that ordeal, right?
And it rebinds you to them.
It makes you understand, like, your existence depends on this, not your thinking, right?
Yeah.
That's exactly what the Mithraic liturgy brings across, because they instruct you.
It's actually a list of instructions, not only how to make the drug that you're going to be using, that they make there.
You bring it to them, the right ingredients, and they put it together, right?
And it's got to ferment for a while.
So, you go through all this fasting and whatnot, and through a preparation of song, because you're going to encounter, this is all in the Mithraic liturgy.
You're going to encounter certain forces, and this force will be this, and this is how you identify them, and this is what you say, this is what you speak, this is what you sing, and it's all, they're like hymns.
And so, it's kind of, you know, look what they did, they charted, they were like pioneers that charted the cosmos there, and out of it, somehow brought healing to people.
Yeah.
Yeah, it was medicine.
Medicine is in, not just for the body, though, for the body, too.
If you were sick, or if you were dying, or something like this, you could go and you could be healed, but also medicine for lethe, right?
To the anamnesis, the unforgetting, the anamnoetic medicine.
Yes, you're throwing a gorgeous creek around, right?
Yeah.
Right?
Exactly.
It's coming from the naos, the mind, and that mind is what's behind the cosmos.
That's how they described it anyway.
Like, the, let me put it this way, the entire organization of the universe has a mind, and she is sexy, sexy, gorgeous.
Oh, I love it.
I love it.
I love it.
Oh, God.
Too many drugs.
Those people were on way too many drugs, though.
Right?
For all the healing sake.
And Galen, by the way, for those of you who think we're just messing around, Galen, the physician of Marcus Aurelius, says Marcus Aurelius is looking better under the influence of the Theriac, right?
And they're not telling people about this, he says.
And he says, oh, but a couple of, who was it, the next emperor?
Now, after Commodus, right, it became known that people were actually involved in preserving the Theriac within the imperial line.
Because after all, these are Caesars, you know, they are the offspring of, ultimately, of Aphrodite herself.
And that's where the living dead girl gets real tissue.
She gets real tissue.
Okay.
You know Numa from antiquity, right?
Yeah, he's one of the original kings of Rome, blah, blah, blah.
And he creates a set of books, right, scrolls.
And these scrolls become the base of Roman religion.
All of the priesthoods, all of the sacrifices, that is, the entheogens that we use in our fumigations, all of those are set up by this guy.
Now, the story is, he has a girlfriend who is constantly just pubescent, right?
And the story about her is, she's actually a thousand years old, right?
And some people say they do have intercourse.
Some people say they don't, right?
One thing we do know, though, is she dictates, she meets him in a very specific grotto, and she dictates to him the whole time, these scrolls that ultimately become the religion of Rome.
And what is gorgeous in all of that is that the people sit around debating things like, well, were they lovers?
You know, just because we're curious, we want to know, were they lovers?
They debate that kind of stuff like that, and they don't sit around and say, wait a minute, either of these people are high, they'll believe anything, right?
Or there's something going on with this oracular tradition.
There's something, there's some kind of science, tech that they've hit.
They've hit some kind of vein.
Now, they took some of these books that the oracles were writing.
It wasn't just her.
Her name was Egeria, right?
And they made her the muse of Rome, right?
It wasn't just Egeria.
There were other oracles who are performing and doing the exact same thing, and they are writing the future.
Think about this for a minute.
You have all sorts of genres of literature that you don't have this.
No.
I'm going to give you an old set of books about what is going to happen 100 years from now, 200 years from now, 300 years from now, 400, 500, 500, 600, 700.
Right?
And we're going to send out all these books.
Well, the Romans decreed, hey, throw this stuff away, right?
Conceal it, hide it, because it's going to cause bad things to happen.
So they do.
And every once in a while, they'll find them.
Oh, they were buried at Numus.
The first time they hit Numus tomb, boom.
All these books came out.
They consoled it.
Oh, God, what do we do with these things?
What do we do?
So they checked.
And the future that was the present was so scary.
They said, this can't get out.
Destroy them.
Now, the question is, the question is, there was a priesthood of people who kept those books called the Quindecum Weary.
Right?
And we have, we don't have the books anymore.
Some people say maybe the Vatican has them in their archives squirreled away.
Who knows?
Maybe they're in the Herculaneum library.
I don't know.
But we have one author who was a priest member of the group that was keeping these prophetic books.
And he wrote an epic.
He wrote an epic about Medea.
And sandwiched within this epic are the oracles.
You have to find the exact sorted translation of reality.
That's the mission.
Use your sorted and bring the reality when you're telling the future.
Right?
And they had it down to such a science that Medea could give an oracle back in around 1000 to 1100 BC.
She could give an oracle about 17 generations later that the priestess of Delphi could then hand down to the dude that Medea predicted would come for it and instructions of what he was to go do.
And it had to do with building civilization.
And so the dudes would do it, go off and found the colony.
Here we are.
And the next thing you know, they've got civilization.
So this is an ancient priestess who is spreading civilization through time, apparently with the ability to know exactly what was going to happen.
Right?
Yeah, this this makes perfect sense from my own experience, because anyone who manages either by being assisted or somehow by their own initiative or heroic in like precociousness to get above time from up there.
The whole linear thing is missing.
It's just not there.
It's all one moment that is like a living book that sings its soul into you.
Right?
And then you sing, you sing like an instrument that's being played by that intelligence.
Isn't that gorgeous and sexy?
Yeah.
I mean, you got to admit the universe, Urania is absolutely fuckable.
You know what I mean?
You know what I mean?
Like this is this is what you dreamed about when you were, you know, prepubescent, just coming into the world of awareness.
And then you hit those junior high years and you're all dirty and lusty and all of a sudden the world of Aphrodite is coming into power.
At that time when you are most discriminatory.
Right?
When those senses are hitting you for the first time and that euphoric ecstasy of her image is hitting you.
That's what you want.
You want the universe.
You want the universe.
It's like a crying out between lovers.
You know what I mean?
And that's, I think that's why the Orphix said the origin is with Eros.
Oh yeah.
Yeah.
Eros and Ananke.
Right?
It's so unfortunate because when we are prepubescent and we are entering puberty and stuff, we're expecting to be reintroduced to the gods.
And what's happening is we're getting reintroduced to like rap music or, you know, being in the military or, you know, some, some vocational school or, you know, like we're getting our, our souls urge to develop and, and experience.
Anamnesis is getting misdirected into bullshit.
Yeah.
Right?
Yeah.
Yeah.
And that's tragic because that's the time when, when, you know, older societies would initiate their children.
Yeah.
The mothers and the fathers differently.
Right.
And different cultures differently.
Yes.
Right.
It's not like there's one appropriate thing.
Right.
Humans are a vast, they're like a topology of different worlds.
Right.
So you have to respect, I mean, you don't have to respect, but I have great appreciation for that incredible diversity and how that is similar to what, what you see when you look up in the sky.
Right.
You see one star field, you see all these stars from all different distances in time.
Right.
It's just like, it's above time up there already.
And the humans down here, we're so trapped in linear time in our thinking and expectations that that's part of what the lethe comes from.
Yeah.
Right.
You know, I, the fact that I can't predict the eclipse really bothers me because that's like standard.
They had that, they had that shit understood long time ago.
What have I lost under my Western monist influencers?
What have I lost that is human, like an understanding of what that is when you look up, you know what I mean?
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
No, I want to know.
I want to know what the ancients experienced when they looked at the night sky.
This is one of my quests.
I want to have that experience.
I don't want the representational knowledge.
I don't want the description.
Right.
I don't want the explanation.
Yeah.
I want to experience their mind.
Yeah.
First hand.
You think of those Scythians, a horse culture, you're on horseback all day long.
Right.
And then when it's time for you to hit the hay, there's no hay for you to hit.
You form a circle and you create a fumigation pit.
And everybody fumigates with cannabis.
And then what is there to do?
Um, cause you haven't built buildings with stuff and your mobile culture, you know, you
don't do that.
Is there what we call gypsy?
Maybe today more mobile culture, right?
And just right in there with the horses, using all the horse products, everything.
Oh God, having relationships with your horses that are like building, building those spirits
that create the Greek world.
And you're out there, um, fumigating, they're fumigating with cannabis and looking up, talking
about the constellations, right?
There's gotta be something that connection with Uranus with the, as the Greeks called it
and with Gaia, you know, you bring together those two and boom, you're a human like you're
supposed to be, right?
Oh God.
Right.
Makes me so excited.
Yeah.
So I wanna, I wanna ask you some questions about your sense.
You know, you seem like a kind of a, in some ways very conflicted because you have an ache
for justice and the return of the Korra.
Yeah.
Right.
Talk to us about the Korra for a minute before I blather on.
Just queen of the underworld, baby.
Think of her.
And when you think of her, Korra is a Mycenaean word and it's a very specific, it's like saying
virgin, but not in the type that is the Parthenos.
This is the holy queen who is wedded.
This is her wedding to the king of the underworld.
This is what she is entering into.
If you think from her perspective, because what is the Ellicinian mystery?
We know this.
They said it, they were allowed to say it.
It's the resurrection, the visible resurrection of the Korra.
It's her.
Who is she?
She is that prophetic Oracle, right?
Why do you think we want her in the first place?
Right?
Remember we're going to the underworld and coming back in this process.
We're not going to stay.
We're going to grab something and come back.
Right?
And that thing that we grab is going to be perceived by us as a new birth.
You're going to feel like you've been born again.
Something is different.
Right?
So all of that stuff is only triggered by the Korra.
It is only triggered by the Oracle.
And that's why Egeria, they know this as far as Italy.
That's why Egeria is working with Numa, the king.
Why isn't he writing his own goddamn laws?
Right?
Because he is not that vessel.
He is not that vessel.
And the fact that they recognize that as a human potential to me is absolutely fantastic.
Does it do what they say?
Does the regimen make you younger?
Is it an ambrosia that sustains an agelessness?
And is it true that they were performing transfusions?
Right?
And people say that in their, this is not only depicted in the text.
It's depicted in the art, the art of the transfusion.
And guess who, guess who is declared to be the inventor of this?
Medea.
And what is the purpose?
You, you have to do it very carefully because you can kill the person in the process.
So you have to know exactly what you can put in.
It's absolutely fantastic.
It's gorgeous.
And it, it is this kind of attack that's divine.
It's a kind of an art that is truly integrating the physical, the visible and the invisible.
Right?
Very, very much putting everything together for one vision.
I love it.
I love it.
The women are transmitting into the men like a spirit nectar that is both wisdom and medicine
and protection from death and resurrection and healing and insight.
They are, they are pulsing it into the man in this vision.
Right.
And direct support of what you just said can be found in Plutarch who quotes a Spartan woman
as saying, I think it was Plutarch as saying, or maybe it was a little lyric poets.
No, this is one of the lyric poets who says, um, Athenian woman asked a Spartan woman.
Why is it that Spartan women have total power over their Spartan husbands?
And her answer was it's because only Spartan women produce men.
Right?
Yeah.
This is what I was talking about earlier.
Like you were an organ in a woman's body.
Do you think you have primacy over her?
Where did you get that idea?
Right?
Right.
What got messed up in your brain sack that led you, what were you feeling insecure or vulnerable
or something?
Right.
So you had to make up stories about your supremacy over your mother.
Right.
Or buy a truck, buy a big truck.
It doesn't matter.
Whatever.
Whatever the compensation.
Right, exactly.
Peacock around, you know, like inflate your importance some more.
Go ahead.
See how that works for you.
Uh, they're famous accounts of the Spartan women, just to illustrate the Spartan character.
And there are numerous accounts of mothers murdering their sons.
When they come back from battle, if they don't have their shields or they have any marks on their
backs for the sake of Sparta, you are not a guardian and boom, kill him.
Wow.
Can you believe what kind?
Oh God.
I know that woman is sexy.
Right.
But what kind of place do you have to reach where you are that you are that, um, power that
gives the true courage, gives that true martial spirit to your sons.
You're the one passing it on.
Right.
It's gorgeous.
I love it.
I love it.
No wonder like Kurgis was right.
Um, wrote it in law in his reforms that the women have to be educated.
Right.
When I read that for the first time, I was like, wait a minute.
It makes sense now because they're just going off the war and the women have to run everything.
Right.
Just like they're running their marriages.
And by the way, they don't all the time wear clothing that covers up their breasts.
And if you have a problem with it, go yourself.
Right?
Right.
Oh God.
Such.
No, the eros.
The eros is everywhere, apparent and unhidden and not seen as something to be denigrated
or ashamed of or embarrassing.
It's quite the opposite.
Without that, what have you got?
Yeah.
Right.
What did you substitute for that, that you think is what?
Pure?
Clean?
What?
What's your story?
Right?
What kind of fiction did you insert to blind you to the power of the feminine eros?
What kind of faith has compelled you to put on this burqa and to hide your natural beauty?
I mean, think about that for a minute.
It's so contrary to the worship of Aphrodite.
Right?
Remember the Arabs, the Arabians, people that we're talking about living in the Arabian Peninsula.
Those people are full of the worship of two gods, Bacchus and Aphrodite.
And so it takes a lot to remove that Aphrodite.
But when you do, you're left with the faith.
Right?
You're left with the faith.
Thank you very much.
Now we've got a faith and, and, uh, we, we put out that gorgeous, gorgeous feminine,
which I think you would think would warp your mind after a while.
Don't you think if you can't envision, like I'm, I'm being completely honest with you here.
Yeah.
Very difficult.
It was very difficult for me to hear something feminine.
Whenever I say God, whenever I say God, it took me a long time.
I wanted to insist.
No, it's masculine.
It's masculine.
It's masculine.
It's gotta be masculine.
Right?
And then I saw an ancient Greek text that used a masculine form to refer to Aphrodite.
And I suddenly, I was, it was like a, my mind was free.
And I was like, Oh, I get it.
I can't hear it that we can't because some jackasses kicked the shit out of our tech.
And now we can't join.
We're prisoners, right?
You're talking, we're farmed, dude.
I totally understand what people say.
You know, we're farmed.
We're part of a process of farming.
This stuff has been taken out of your life.
It's been taken out of your programming.
You were supposed to be exposed to all these mushrooms and grass and stuff coming out of trees.
They even used an antiquity.
Like you bruise a tree intentionally, and then you take all this, the sap that comes out of the tree.
Oh God, you'd love that stuff.
Put it in anything you drink.
And after a few weeks, your stomach will work better.
You dumb ass.
And you'll feel better.
Right?
Oh God.
What happened to that world?
Oh, you got something there from a tree or something, right?
Yeah.
This is pollen from my tree.
Nice.
And when I'm doing things, I use the pollen, right?
It's its reproductive essence.
Yeah.
It's pollen.
Right?
It's the spirit of the trees, you know, sex.
Yeah.
Straight up.
You're a tree molester.
Yeah.
Oh, that's me.
Yeah.
I go around molesting trees.
You've heard of tree huggers.
Yeah, I know.
I take it to a whole other level.
This guy's got jars of pollen.
You know, the, the tree by squad is going to break in.
As soon as they figure out how to move, they're going to break in.
They're going to arrest you.
And they're going to use all that pollen as evidence.
It's anti-inflammatory, isn't it?
Or something.
I mean, it's very complex.
Like it, I don't, there's things you can use sap for.
I use sap too.
Right?
Like what you're talking about.
These are things that I discussed.
I discovered by talking to trees, not by talking to humans.
Oh, right.
Fantastic.
So, you know, go to the source.
Yeah.
You know, direct connection.
It's one of the reasons why I spend most of my time talking with women.
There are, there are unusual men, but the men mostly they're inclined to kind of peacock and stuff.
Even myself.
Yeah.
Right.
I have the same problem.
I'm, I'm a man.
Yeah.
But the women, man, that, that the water of their heartful wisdom is just, I want to preserve
it and sing its praises and protect it and adore it.
You know, I'm just, I'm made for that.
Yeah.
I got, I got some other questions here though, that I want to get to, and I'm hoping that
we'll get to have another few conversations at least over time.
Of course.
Of course.
Okay.
We don't have to get to everything today, but I want to know, was Scarborough, was he
doing the rituals in the PGM?
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
Absolutely not.
And it would be a shame if I were to say that he were to his family, it would be an absolute
shame.
No, Dr. Scarborough was a straight up, straight up history of medicine scholar.
And that's why he got chosen to do the medicine of the PGM and translate it and whatnot.
No, absolutely not.
So the answer to that is no.
Okay.
And as far as, so I appreciate that answer.
That makes sense to me.
And what you're saying is, you know, he was a scholar and academic, and one who studies
the language and translating it and, you know, the histories and things like this.
Yeah, he was not a classical philologist.
He was a medical historian.
So, um, he used Greek, of course he had to learn Greek in the process.
Um, and he used Greek, uh, um, in order to get just to the medical sources.
So like he, he didn't have to read Homer and play though.
And he did end up reading a whole bunch right over time, but his real strength was the fact
that he was burrowing into the medical texts and nobody had done that.
And he had a little medical background too.
He, I think he went to medical school for a year, maybe two when he decided to transfer
over.
Um, also he has like Byzantine studies.
He did a masters in Byzantine studies and nobody, um, nobody does that late.
Um, you know, classicists tend to stop like the third century on a domain, fourth century.
Maybe they'll go that far anything after that.
They don't want to get involved.
So all of the great doctors like Orabasius, right.
Who are not part of that.
You know, they're not one of the early ones.
Like, you know, it's not dioscorty.
So people hadn't been jumping into it.
Dr. Scarborough to his credit.
He did.
He jumped into it and he did all the Byzantine docs.
And there's a whole bunch of, uh, Christing there.
There's a whole, he didn't know that.
I mean, he knew, he knew it, but he didn't know it would become a, an issue.
Right.
The Christing thing.
So, um, he was a good scholar.
He's a very good scholar.
When did you first begin experimenting with actual magical practice?
Oh, since it's obvious you have.
Yeah.
Um, you know, over time, just enjoying the muse, I would say that there were numerous things
that you claim were magical, but I didn't really get, um, I didn't really approach it as a kind
of a scientific, you know, inquiry until I was working on the play, um, the Medea.
And I come across a couple of incantations that were of the incubus.
And that's really when I said, okay, I'm gonna, I'm gonna really push the border here and see,
you know, if I can, if I can reproduce it.
So when the, uh, when the event, you know, happened in the next day, somebody said, uh,
Oh my God, um, this person is claiming that X, Y, and Z happened.
Um, and it was an exact narrative of what I had done from a distance.
Right.
Then it's a positive exam.
It was at that point that I was like, Oh, wow.
Wow.
Right.
And it was from that point forward that I get all the emails bombarding me.
People say you're having intercourse with me in my dreams.
I get that.
It's like a genre now.
And so now I get it so much.
I'm at the point of saying, um, uh, how was it?
Right.
It has to be, you know, maybe it was a good experience.
And some people volunteer and tell me that I saw you and you were a goat and you strangled me.
Right.
Okay.
I get it.
Wow.
Oh, right.
So what can you do?
I mean, I mean, that's different though, because, um, so look, you are something of a psychopomp.
And a psycho, what a psychopomp, a hierophant.
Um, this is what priests mimic.
Yeah.
Right.
But you're like the actual thing.
So when people encounter you, right, it's like you are, um, pulsing like a drum.
Right.
And their psyche receives those pulses.
And then at night they dream and those pulses take form in their awareness.
Yeah.
So it's not necessarily the same thing as you did the incubus.
Right.
And then something happened.
It's not the same.
Right.
Well, like I said, that first trip, that first trip really showed me how it could be done.
And, um, imagine that you discovered something like this.
Um, wouldn't you, wouldn't you, uh, take it to its nth degree?
Wouldn't you, you know what I mean?
Okay.
I'm serious.
Wouldn't you?
Because I was so taken aback by the fact that those results were exactly what I had done
in the performance, even to the point, even to the point of thought, just as I was envisioning
this thought just in my head, there she is.
The it's a roommate.
Oh God, I've got to paralyze this person.
Her description of my paralysis, my incubus paralysis was gorgeous.
It was right on.
I wish it could be preserved.
If she hadn't gone nuts, it would have been great to preserve it.
Right.
Um, there's a capacity here that is feared.
And it's the reason that people get kicked out of institutions.
It's the reason that people get, um, written off.
It's a reason, um, that you sustain the current faith narrative.
Right.
Somebody's got to come along.
Some Pythagoras has to come along and has to poke a big hole in your universe in order
for you to go there.
That's what you're talking about in your experiences, right?
Those are divine experiences and that has to take place until it does.
Guess what?
You're bound for Lethe.
You're just going to keep going and drinking the Lethe until what happens?
What if you'd never purge that corruption?
What if you believe lies for an eternity?
Right.
What happens to those living souls?
Right.
Oh God.
These are the kinds of, this is the kinds of thing that I'm glad that this new Renaissance
of the understanding that drugs go hand in hand with life and, and beauty and intelligence
and, um, some kind of martial triumph where the beautiful overcomes the ugly.
Hmm.
Right.
Oh God.
It's gorgeous.
It's like that invisible muse.
It's like she has a, you can tell her themes that she likes in her stories.
If you just look at your life as her story, what is she told?
What are the themes that have run through it?
And there's certain things that she really likes and that whole eros, that whole love.
Um, I don't know when you describe you being in that place, right?
I get it.
I kind of get Addison, mother sibling.
I kind of get what they were doing.
You know, I don't know.
What do you think about all those mystery religions?
Are they, are they reaching for the same beauty?
What are they doing?
Um, you know, one of the problems that we have as humans is we want to encompass something
in language.
Um, and that can be useful.
Like I'm a, I'm look, I love books.
I'm, I'm a book, you know, I'm a book guy.
Um, and I'm really curious about all the books on your shelves.
Maybe you'll send me a photograph so I can see what's on there sometime.
Uh, and I was also hoping in the future, maybe you might do some bibliomancy, but let me respond
to what you said.
There's some things if I were smart, if I were actually wise, what I would have done during
my experience was write nothing and say nothing and stay fucking pregnant, stay pregnant, right?
That's what I, that's what I would try to do in the future because they were pouring something
into me and I was transforming it into language, but that fails in a certain way, right?
Some things are meant to be silently undergone and you are fertilized and you are transformed,
but you don't let it out, right?
You don't speak it.
There's actually a form of necromancy or a form of activating the sortes that they call
is, um, invoking Takita on the Roman side, Takita, who's the goddess of silence.
Right.
There's a communication, all of these magical forms that they're doing all of this liturgy.
This is oral stuff.
And the song is a big part of the whole process.
So for they, they recognize that you can kind of know, switch the polarity.
I don't know how you switch over to the silent Oracle, right?
Right.
And for some reason that's supposed to give you a more direct, it's like, what is it like
a secure connection or something?
You know what I mean?
It's like, I don't understand it, but, um, the dance that they do is incredible.
So there's a direct link with that silence.
Um, yeah.
I don't know.
Maybe the monks figured something out too, with all that.
All I'm trying to say is that we moderns, we have a problem.
And the problem is that once we have a name for something, we think we know what it is.
Let me be really clear.
That's not knowledge.
That's something different.
Knowledge is when you've tasted her mouth.
Yeah.
You know, you are right.
Right.
Yeah.
Knowledge is intimacy.
It's not that you have a word for things or now you have an explanation.
That's a different thing.
That's an aspect of knowledge, but I I'm starving for the other stuff.
I want the direct intimacy of the experience.
You want the devil, man.
That's what you want.
Cause you know, um, Adam knew his wife and the question is, did the devil?
No.
The devil.
No.
Yeah.
Did he know?
Well, he had, they had two children.
Yeah.
Some people say Cain was his.
Right.
There are apocryphal texts that talk about the devil scraping.
I don't know if you've seen these, the devil scraping his armpits and putting it into
Eve's drink.
And why was he doing that?
Because he wanted her to fall for him alone.
Hmm.
Isn't that something?
It's like a love.
You know, it's obvious to, it's obvious to me.
I'm in the, um, the stories in Genesis, they did not arise with those people.
They, those stories come from elsewhere.
It seems pretty obvious to me.
Yeah.
You know, people say it's, it's reflecting its Hebrew origin or it's Middle Eastern origins.
And they'll compare it with Gilgamesh and stuff like that.
I still can't get by the very opening of Genesis and how technically advanced it is.
And there's nothing coming out of their languages.
That's even close to that.
We have to, let me put it this way.
We have to try to figure out how they built stuff, right?
We have to try to figure it out.
Do we have to try to figure out how the Greeks built stuff?
No, because they coined the term grammar and they created a language that could express
how things were grown and I was, or built.
And I was just looking the other day.
I was reading, I think it was Philostratism, Imogenes.
Um, and he's talking about the great wonders of the world.
And he says, you know what?
Everybody talks about these wonders.
And I'm like, oh dude, he's going to say something really radical.
Right.
He says, I've seen this.
I've seen that.
I've seen the pyramids.
And I have seen the temple of Diana at Ephesus.
And I can tell you for a fact, there is nothing more heavenly, more beautiful and more perfect
than the temple of Diana.
Makes those pyramids look like, not like junk.
People think about it.
What do you want to build?
Giant heaps of rock.
Right.
What are we going to make it?
It's going to contain the sarcophagus, the Pharaoh.
Right.
And then everybody makes up their magic.
But fuck that.
Look at the temple of Diana, dude.
Look at it.
Artemis of Ephesus.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Oh my God.
Just the proportions, dude.
I don't care about a stack of rocks.
I want to see some columns that remind me of a woman's figure.
That's what I want to see.
And you know what they did.
They brought it right out, right out of the stone.
They've got ladies standing there.
Right.
Columns.
They're making columns into women with sheer sheer clothing.
You can see through.
It's like a mirage in stone.
Right.
Okay.
You can either have that or you can have some big piles of rocks.
You know, there's nothing you can do with a pyramid besides look at it.
Right.
Oh God.
Yeah.
Well, I applaud your active veneration of the feminine and Eros in all of her glorious
expression.
Absolutely.
Beautiful.
It's a compensation for Christianity, right?
We've got to bring her back to stop the monism.
That's their weakness.
Love it.
Isn't that gorgeous?
Yeah, absolutely.
I love it.
What do you think about talking to Bob Larson?
Do you think that's a productive avenue?
I don't know him yet.
I heard you mention his name.
We can discuss this.
Just check him out.
I'd love your opinion because he goes way back in Arizona.
I used to listen to him when I was a Baptist.
And he's a castor out of demons.
Now, he did say that I have demons.
And when I told him to shove his holy oil, he didn't take it all that well.
But in the episode, he does actually anoint.
He anoints a little statue that Danny has there of a God that you're supposed to put steaming and blood into this offering.
And he has a little palace that he's got going.
And Bob wanted.
He zeroed in on it when he came in the room.
He zeroed in on it.
It was like, oh, that thing's got to get blessed.
I don't know.
I think he just wanted to touch it.
I don't know.
Well, you know, you're sort of the opposite of an, you know, I heard you use the phrase exorcist killer, but you're kind of the opposite of an exorcist.
And I was trying to think of a word for that.
And it's like an introitist.
Yeah.
Bring them in.
Right.
You invite them in.
Yeah.
Instead of pushing them out, you call them in.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's I guess there should be a name for it.
Yeah.
I mean, invocation is the, you know, the common word for it, but right to bring the beings within yourself.
You know, they used to use that, too.
That has a beautiful history to invoke in in classical Roman religion was to go to a city that you're about to take over.
And you bribe the gods to come with you back to Rome.
And then if they will assist you, you'll get all of their stuff and you can forget this podunk shit bill.
You'll be in Rome on one of the seven hills, baby.
Right.
Right.
And why were they doing it?
They were moving the divine powers.
Again, these are people whose traditions are able to see the invisible.
Yeah.
And they're coming up with prophetesses who were telling the future.
So this is, you know, the danger of revealing what is in the oracles was not that Rome would collapse.
Right.
It wasn't.
No, it was that the polis would be terrified.
It was the it was the danger of exploiting the glory of bringing it to its ultimate rallying point where it just smashed the rest of the world.
It was it was a terrific ending.
And they didn't want that to be in the common imagination.
It was the apocalypse.
And how do you how do you how do you ignore the fact that the apocalypse of John is using the very same vocabulary that these oracles are using?
How do you ignore that kind of thing?
You can't man.
You can't ignore those traditions.
They're harnessing the same mystery power and they're talking about it.
I love it.
If you're one thing I like to say that people it pisses them off.
And that's why I like to say it.
But it's a reality.
If you have not participated in a death and resurrection episode, you have not become any sort of redeemed Christian.
No, you have not.
You have just followed some kind of faith that's allowed to convince you to think that you were.
But if you have not truly been born again, according to the mysteries themselves, you're doomed to leafy.
You're doomed to leafy.
Enjoy.
Right.
Right.
Because it's like Cicero pre and post free free initiation post initiation.
Right.
You didn't make it to the post.
Sorry.
You get funneled back that back in to the system.
You need some more punishment.
Right.
Apparently you didn't learn your lesson.
Right.
Praise Jesus.
The Christ.
And by the way, the Christ is a sex drug.
Welcome.
Welcome.
Do you mean, do you mean the true mystery religion that's cosmic and that has this power that you can describe as magic or whatever you want to describe it?
This mind altering power.
You mean this religion is linked to a unity in sexual intercourse that is meant to bring you to life.
Oh, think about that for a minute.
It sounds natural.
Like that's how it should be.
No, no, no.
It's not a radical.
Let's all believe the guy on the clouds who's going to come back and screw us all.
Right.
Let's follow him instead.
We don't care how much he lies.
Right.
He was arrested with a naked boy.
We don't care.
Right.
Oh, some people, they do wrong things, but they do it for the reason we want to do it.
That's maggoted brain is what that is.
And that's our, unfortunately, that's our era.
I think we're the era of maggoted brain.
So there's nothing, there's nothing particularly radical about your demand for the reintroduction of Eros.
The women who I speak with, they're all, I mean, I'm going to, in just a few minutes, I'm going to be entering, interviewing Dr. Joanna Kujawa, who studied this for her entire life and career and has had her own, you know, non-ordinary experiences around this.
It's not radical.
It's only radical in the face of Christianity and Islam.
And even in, again, you know, like if we got past the surface of those monotheistic religions, we would find Eros underneath.
And if, and if the surface is sustained, then what you get is kind of perversion, right?
Then you get a problem because what you, what they've done is they've sort of made kind of the wrapping paper of lies on the surface.
And so the Eros has to bubble up from underneath, right?
Somehow you can't actually, you can't evict it.
Yeah.
You can't get rid of it.
How are you going to get rid of it?
So what, what's going to happen is you'll, it'll warp, right?
It'll warp underneath those taboos.
Yeah.
It's too bad.
The Egyptians were smart enough to get rid of it within a generation, right?
Otherwise it would have completely altered Egyptian history, that monism.
Um, just like it, the monism that spread in the West altered Roman history.
Um, yeah, I love it.
It's a, it's a, and you know, there are people out here, out there who were saying these very things and they happen to be pagan mystagogues.
Like Julian, the apostate, right?
Have you ever read Julian's work on the great mother?
No, I hope to.
Oh God.
You'll love it.
You'll love it.
It gives it, it gives you a whole new understanding just to hear it from their breath.
And he was actually involved in a rite, um, of Hecate that was, you know, he was trying to bring back, um, the mystagoguery.
He was trying to bring back the vision.
And one of those ways of doing it was the motivation of the stone, right?
To get the, um, stone representation of the deity to move and speak.
Right.
And he was involved in this.
Remember they're using all sorts of kinds of incantations that involve all sorts of kinds of drugs.
So, but reportedly these fumigations reportedly, um, it worked and they got the stone to speak.
Right.
That guy, Julian is the guy who's warning everybody else.
Um, the, uh, monists are going, the Christians are going to take over.
And when they do, they're going to destroy all of this knowledge that we have in the libraries.
Guess what they did.
Guess what they did.
And they, the, so he tried to stop them by saying Christians can no longer teach, but they murdered him like a year later.
So, um, you know, that's the way it is.
I don't know if you noticed it.
I was in that interview with Danny.
Um, they said, uh, the one that just came out, we were looking at the Talmud with the passage, the famous passage about the infants having intercourse with infants.
And, um, one of the passages that I noticed that was above it that they were looking at said, um, let anybody who interferes in reading these scriptures or whatever it was.
Um, let them to be guilty of a crime of death, punishable by death.
Right.
Do you see what happens with the flow of information?
It's control.
It's control is directly the stuff you're talking about that, you know, you'd think would be like spiritual and exempt from control.
It's not, it's not the demon possession.
The fact that they're taking people who are melancholics that are depressed and Galen is openly prescribing drug treatments for those possessions.
In one case, um, recommending the joining with a priestess.
Right.
Right.
Which kind of makes sense.
If you're depressed, if I was, when I was a kid, if I, when I was going through depressive mood swings and stuff like that, if I'd had a priestess that I could have spent, you know, some time with, you know what I mean?
I mean, Jesus, I probably would have been happier too.
Yeah.
You know, damn.
I'm with you.
Yeah.
Amen.
I'm going to have to go because I have another interview to do today.
Yes.
But I am, um, absolutely enthusiastic about your work and the chance to speak with you and learn
together and see through some of the veils of nonsense of modernity and history.
Okay.
Absolutely.
Love it, man.
I love the conversation.
I'm so glad that it was a conversation and not just tell me this and tell me this and tell
me this and tell me this.
I really, I really would rather interact with you than sit here and, you know, try to, I don't know, throw out some lecture bullshit.
So thank you.
It's been a good, this is a good interview.
And by the way, just to let your audience know, you have totally in that article that you wrote, you have totally captured the situation.
You did your research and it was straight up.
So I appreciate that.
I appreciate that.
I'll let you get to your interview.
Thank you.
That was an absolute joy for me.
And I, you know, your, um, your presence in your spirit, your virtue, your ethos, it is an amnoetic.
Right.
It is, it is catalytic.
Oh, I love that.
It's unforgetting.
Right.
And just deep respect and appreciation for that brother.
So an amnesis.
That's what we need a prescription for.
Yeah.
I love it.
Let's make the medicine together.
Yes, exactly.
Look exactly.
Oh my God.
It's breaking.
The Renaissance is coming.
Okay.
Get to your, um, Maria Gamboudis.
Right.
I interviewed Maria Margu, but today I'm going to be talking with Dr. Joanna Kuyawa.
Oh, Kuyawa.
It's Dr. Kuyawa.
Yeah.
I've heard her name frequently, frequently, frequently.
So awesome.
Enjoy.
Have fun.
Yes.
Again, very soon, my friend.
And thank you to you and to Chewy and to the dead girl and the beings that inform your
spirit.
All respect.
Definitely.
Definitely to the dead girl.
The muse.
Yes.
Oh, I love it.
So beautiful.
Okay.
Um, have a good one and enjoy your next interview.
Again soon.
