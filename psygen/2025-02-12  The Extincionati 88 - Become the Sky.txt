I don't want to set the world on fire, I just want to start a flame in your heart.
So you just asked me if I had any thoughts about Jack Sarfati and, you know, we were prior to that, we were speaking about incredibly brilliant women like Sarah James, the Dream Incubator or, you know, the Onira font.
I love that word, or Onira pomp, Emory Amerigood, the Greek Mystic of China, China Kajala.
All right, there's some noise.
Can we just go into deep space?
Hello, hello, just here?
Probably that person just muted their mic.
Yep.
And that's probably Nathan.
Give me just a second.
We'll actually do the intro.
All right.
So let us take a moment together to remember all of those beings who have striven to establish a beautiful way of being on our world and on all worlds.
Those men and women and children and elders and animals and living places.
Brilliant of spirit and gentle of heart.
And also fierce.
Who strove throughout their lives to mend fundamental problems on our world, which are primarily, it appears, with humans.
They arise in our species.
So somehow at the same time as having the capacity to establish something paradisical here, our species seems fascinated with the possibility of hell as well.
And I want to remember all of those beings past, present and future who strove to become living medicine for the problems that our species so trenchantly recapitulates generation after generation.
And we gather in the hope of sustaining their vision and dream and establishing amazing and beautiful and intelligent ways to be human together.
Remembering them inspires us.
And may we serve their their dreams and passions with the same brilliance and heartful awareness that they brought to their existence and their struggles.
Oh, beautiful ones, we remember you.
So, you know, we're talking about brilliant women.
I named a few.
I'm particularly amazed at this point by Sarah Jane's work.
She has studied dreaming her entire life.
One of the things she said that I think is really brilliant is that she felt that if she could just sustain lucidity, this is really important to me because I've had a similar kind of concern.
When she was very little, she was lucidly dreaming all the time, just naturally, and she's not the only person like this.
A number of the people that have spoken with her are similar.
And as a little girl, she thought, if I can just sustain that lucidity across the barrier into waking, I will defeat death.
I will live forever.
And I think that's amazing for a number of reasons.
The first is what the children know of death anyway.
I think they don't.
I almost died once when I was a little kid and I was just curious.
I wasn't scared.
You know, I was like, oh, I'm going to die right now.
And I was like, oh, OK.
Ain't nothing I can do.
I'm going to sure miss mommy.
There wasn't any like terror or anything.
I'm like, I just fell down on the ground unconscious and, you know, started dying.
I guess it's kind of cool that I didn't have to actually die at five years old.
I was suffocating.
I couldn't breathe.
My lungs were locked up.
My mom woke up when she heard the thump of my body on the floor.
She was napping on the couch nearby.
Managed to make it out to the living room before I passed out.
She got me breathing again.
But yeah, so Sarah thought if I just learned to stay lucid all the time,
then I will never die, which is such a brilliant thought for a child to have.
Not only that, I mean, how oppositional to everything the adults are doing,
which is almost always the opposite of lucidity, right?
The waking world of human beings is the catastrophic opposite of dream lucidity
for most of us much of the time.
Now there are exceptions, you know, when we're being really loving
or we're trying to grow together or even in our, you know, in our meetings,
we at least urge on lucidity because we sort of have this agreement, right?
We start out with an agreement to try to see and remember and learn.
And even like the things that I said in the beginning of the meeting,
man, I really mean those things.
Those are not mere words to me.
My heart desperately needs a context in which to chase its origin
and the beauty of the possibility of our existence with other, you know,
people like myself in that one, in those senses.
And, you know, I've studied dreaming in my own way my entire life.
I know a lot of unique things about dreaming that I think are very uncommon.
Even in my interview with Sarah, my first one, and I hope to do another soon.
She was startled by one of my questions, which is,
what do you think the source of illumination in dreaming is?
That's a number occurred to her.
So I feel, I feel kind of excited that I was able to ask a question
that she had never yet considered about dreaming.
But I could ask her a lot of questions because I, I'm a weird, I'm a weird mind.
But yeah, she's, she's really brilliant.
And the thing about lucidity is that it, it unifies the normally distinct aspects of awareness.
And one of the things that I always wondered was, you know,
all the, the dreaming experts are talking about lucid dreaming,
but not, I, I haven't heard one of them talk about lucid waking.
Apparently this idea never occurred to them.
But it seems to have occurred to Sarah, right?
Because from, even as a little kid, she thought, apparently she thought that if she could retain the lucidity
that she normally experienced, that she commonly experienced in dreaming,
into her waking experience that she would be free from death.
That's a really trippy idea.
Now, of course, it's not actually clear that death, it's not clear that death exists.
It really isn't.
We, the death of our body exists.
That's real, that's, that's going to happen in so much as, you know, this is what we mean by death.
But the death of the self is wildly unlikely, in my view.
There's no, there's, there's almost no evidence for it.
Other than, you know, the person disappears from our experience, which seems like a lot of evidence, but isn't.
So the death of the body, that's real, for sure, but the death of this, of the being that, what is the right word, that animates, right, the being that animates the body.
Very much doubt this myself, there's so much clear evidence in my view, for that not being real.
And rather, rather than being destroyed or ceasing to exist.
What happens is a transition into a different layer.
Yeah, I think.
But yeah, it's just brilliant that she thought, if I can just remain lucid, I will defeat death.
That's awesome.
Brilliant idea.
And then, of course, you know, we find all of these traditions.
And this is going to get to something that George was saying in a recent text message.
Find all of these traditions that associate something very similar to death with healing.
Healing impossible things.
There's a story, of course, it's anecdotal.
And that during the mysteries of Alexis, right, where they would take thousands of people from all walks of life,
through an initiation.
First, they would have to purge themselves, right?
So it would be six months.
I think of abstention.
And sex.
Well, it's not hard for me, I can abstain from that forever.
Eating meat, right?
Fasting, not abstaining from fasting, but fasting.
Cold water bat bathing, a lot of sort of hardships, six months of prep.
And then you carry a piglet with you, you get a piglet.
You traverse this long path over a number of days together with the other initiates.
And then you go through this process, which is what, you know, Hillman, I don't think he actually understands the process.
But he does know that there was a way to experience death and rebirth, even though I don't know what he thinks about it.
This is one of the things I hope to ask him about, if I get a chance to talk to him again.
And he thinks, you know, this was a thing done with intoxicants or that the medusae, medusae were involved.
The medusae, I don't know how to pronounce that, A-E at the end, means plural, pluralizes the medusa.
But it's clear that there probably were substances involved.
There's a record of a man who'd been, I think he'd been blind his entire life.
And he went through this and came out with the ability to see.
It's clear that not everyone, like, right, you had to be selected to be healed.
But you had a shot at it, right, even if it was, you know, impossibly, impossible to heal injury or something.
You had a shot.
And, you know, this is a, this is a thing where you meet the divine beings.
So essentially, you're going to travel from this world to the, what I call, what I refer to as the origin world.
And that origin world, which most of us have no conscious experience of, I have experienced it.
Or I claim to have, you know, if people want to question you about it.
I have to say that compared to that, the realness of this world is trivial.
It's not real at all.
The origin world is this impossible thing.
You can be in both worlds at once.
You can be in the origin world and incarnate here at the same time.
I wouldn't be surprised if babies have this experience and then forget it as they become acculturated and in language.
I think they probably do have this experience.
I don't know what their experience during conception is.
I think they do have experience during conception.
It's unclear how that or if that's remembered.
But yeah, there's some kind of a strange amnesia that afflicts us in the process of incarnating, right?
Not just, you know, by force of incarnation, but in the process we undergo, which is a process of anolucidity, right?
Like the loss of lucidity.
And if we had lucidity, then I think it would be impossible not to sense the origin world because the thing that you call your mind is actually the spark of that world in the incarnate world.
So that means that it's as if there's a kind of lightning that's touching you all the time.
And if that lightning of the origin world were to go away, you would perish immediately.
You would certainly not be able to have awareness in my view.
I realize this all sounds theoretical, but I'm going somewhere with this.
So the ancient Greeks and other cultures, certainly Egyptians and others before them, though Hillman would like us to believe this all starts with the Greeks or the hello hello.
Hello.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
I can't remember.
Palagians.
Something like this, the sort of the pre Greek peoples.
but no it starts way back and other cultures have known about these things but in the greeks
the mystery traditions literally take you down under the earth
you kill the piglet to symbolize before you begin you kill the piglet to symbolize the death
of the sovereignty of your human animal desires over the desires of your spirit
so your soul or origin what i call origin so the the idea is that it's sort of to flip over
so that no longer you can no longer be enslaved by the desires or the fears of your body
the um the slaughter of these piglets poor little piglets it's not merely symbolic but it's also
symbolic of putting to death um the stuff that keeps you trapped
that causes the amnesia which is mostly your human fears and your desires for
sensory pleasures right and there's a really good reason why you'd want to put those away
and the reason is that if you could even for a moment experience your soul's senses you would
never give a about any kind of pleasure you could ever have in the flesh you would not care you like
sex i don't give a food don't need that water who cares sunlight doesn't matter um there are pleasures
so profoundly ecstatically beyond anything you can imagine that the pleasures that you that we seek
the comforts that we seek in our incarnate aspect are just you could just forget about them they have
they have no meaning in the face of even a few moments of this lucidity of understanding what you are
and where you come from and who your actual family is and what your role in that family is and all of
these things um so george was saying last night i'm gonna i'm gonna ask him to sort of step in here
and and take over for for time because i've been blathering long enough um i'll just i'll just finish
up with a couple things so post initiation the successful initiates have essentially died to
they've experienced death while they're alive this is what is referred to as the second birth
that we sometimes hear about in religious traditions particularly christianity although christianity
steals this idea and reformulates it as something that you can only happen if you you know worship jesus
which i think is absurd i doubt jesus even wanted to be worshiped if jesus existed i don't think he
was like worship me and be free i don't think that's what he was talking about at all most likely
what happened is that the tenets of the mysteries of alexis were misconstrued by a small group of humans
who decided to make a power play and rip off all these ideas and then um trademark them and say you'll
die forever and be punished forever and blah blah unless you do exactly what we say and on and on and
on um but the the goal was to be absolutely free from being compelled by the animal aspects of who you
who you are as a human being and so an inversion right what happens is the soul the sort of underneath
of you right flips over and becomes on the top and the animal aspects are subjugated to it instead of
your soul powers being subjugated to your animal aspects which is miserable suffering it's like a
fish not knowing what water is and not being ever being in water right this is how most of us live
we live like a bird never having flown you know a snake never having slithered um go ahead yeah well
i think death is more like a latent potentiality within life rather than an event at the end of the
life process so death is more like an ever-present possibility within life itself so it can only be realized
within within life yeah that's brilliant yeah so you have to die while you're alive in order to
experience it it's not at the end of life i suppose that's what i mean it's actually there's no way
to die that doesn't happen in life right right yeah it's like sunrise can only happen in the nighttime
there's no other way for that to happen right yeah but but like life and death aren't separated by an
interval i suppose that's what i mean what i mean to say is that death is within life itself within the
waking experience of life it hovers over what life itself is as opposed to being at the end of life so
um to actualize death is is initiation so there's a i think there's a there's a dimension
um there's a dimension to life which when actualized uh yields this kind of occult um
influx of information which i think proceeds from this uh
uh the same force that we attribute to death that we call death there's a there's a there's a
relationship or a link there that's absolutely brilliant um obviously this is well known throughout
many traditions um in zen uh i can't remember who it was might have been sasaki roshi who said something
like um die the man who dies once on the pillow will never taste death again
all right and what he means is die to the illusory self in meditation experience the complete cessation of
that nonsense um that illusory deception uh
uh and be rescued from all you know all suffering you know then you can choose things like if you want
to incarnate again or not or what um all kinds of things yeah so
yeah well there's there's a similar relationship between light and space or light and darkness
so you know ordinarily we imagine that light and darkness are two opposite extremes or that they
exist along a spectrum but really darkness and light interpenetrate so instead of thinking that
light is propagating through space you could you could take the the opposite stance and recognize that
space itself is within light there's there's an inverse truth so i guess that's also what i mean so
so to recognize that death is within life is the same kind of act as recognizing that space is within
light there's a there's a very similar uh i think um structure there yeah most people would find that
terribly counterintuitive i don't um
um it's absolutely brilliant that you say things like this uh
you know one of the ridiculous features of human cognition is to take aspects of existence as separate
and
i guess you could imagine a box in which there's no light
right you could say like well inside this box we created a situation where it's there's no there are no
photons in there okay great but the box is in the universe how will you evict the universe from the
box okay you have the unit you know the box is already in something that is swimming in light
time space beings you know awareness intelligence all these things so you can you know you can make a
box inside which you think there's absolutely nothing right um absolute zero right but the box you made the box
so so how can you evict your making of the box from the box and the universe you are an expression of the
universe the box is an expression of the universe so you might think like no we can make nothing in
there there's nothing there there's nothing you're wrong you're just wrong there's no way to make nothing
right yeah i mean that also i think you know to some extent um
illuminates what you were saying about the um the dream world so what illuminates the dream image
right um you know so we tend to think that light illuminates an image so you know we think that
the beam of light like a flashlight in a dark room illuminates some kind of um you know spatial
or spatially extended image but you can take the opposite stance and recognize that the light beam
itself contains an image so the image is within the light it's the exact opposite you know yeah this is
yeah see this kind of intelligence is so rare it's one of the reasons i adore your mind
you're a very unique intelligence as a human being one of the most unique intelligences i have ever come
across keep going by all means and go go to the dyspepsia let's let's have the fucking comedy
yeah yeah because it's exactly what you're saying these religions weren't there to cause you to worship
beings you didn't first of all let me just be really clear about something
it is impossible to worship that which you are that which makes you and sustains you moment to moment
um it's not impossible to adore it but worship worship would be like if i constantly sang george's
praises with no having no experience of george at all right and and actually refusing to have any
contact with george so what i'm trying to get at is if you were to touch if the origin
world were to emerge even partially in your awareness you would instantly sing and dance and adore it
helplessly there's nothing you could possibly do to stop those things from happening your soul would
ring like the sun with familiarity recognition awe wonder ecstasy joy um freedom you would just your
whole being would just ring like a bell and i know this because i've experienced it directly
it's the opposite of worship you can't help it it's like a bird flying or a heart beating there's nothing
you can do that could possibly intervene in that if this were to touch your awareness while you're you know
awake or dreaming and so this idea of worship is what happens only after that goes away
right so it's like oh you put me in a prison where i can't feel my nature or origin then i could start
praying or something like worshiping um something that i have no real experience of or very little
experience of and i'm just trying to say that it's like the backwards thing you're talking about where
they think light illuminates it's of course reasonable to think the light illuminates things
but there's something that illuminates your mind without which you can't recognize light or illumination or
anything right um and so originally these uh many of these spiritual experiences were um oriented as medicine
um renewal resurrection healing the death of um the blindness of our common day-to-day waking
experience the reawakening of wonder and awe and ecstasis um and also intellect go ahead right well
this is what ties it back to coca-cola because uh john pemberton originally marketed coca-cola as an herbal
tonic it was supposed to be like a miraculous cure for all sorts of ailments like indigestion headaches
and fatigue um but over time it it basically became the product of marketing hype and i think something
similar happened in christianity you can you can actually trace the the history the editorial history
of the books of the new testament um to see how they were uh interpolated or modified and then compiled
with this clear like editorial strategy and a theological design which i think people like
alman hillman actually misunderstand to some extent like you can't read the books of the bible
independently because the theology is baked in and they were written with respect to each other
by a single group of people so uh so the theology is there it isn't something that you superimpose on
the text it's something that you're supposed to uh to glean by design um a very specific message
that you're supposed to take away from reading the text so um i think alman hillman gets that wrong but
uh what do you think he thinks
well he seems to think that the gospel of mark is a historical document or even like you know
the gospel of luke which clearly they aren't they were written probably over the span of 10 years by
maybe the same person or a single group of people so he seemed i mean he i think alman hillman is aware
that um the gospel of mark is based on homeric episodes um i think he knows about dennis mcdonald and
uh like literary mimesis or mimesis criticism um but he i think he where he airs is in thinking that
jesus performed these acts that mark describes i don't think that's like as if it's a historical
document that's not i don't think that's what it is at all um so so because mark is aware of paul
and because paul was probably an ahistorical person like a confabulated literary construct
designed by the proto-catholic church or the proto-orthodox church to counter marcionism
mark and paul have a unified theological message
and that message is centered on grounding the character of jesus in in a specific jewish context
which probably wasn't there to begin with so um basically to judaize this character to give him
a jewish genealogy to give him a place on earth because marcion you know contended that jesus was
some kind of alien that descended from space and he was a fully grown human being without a birth
narrative or without even a resurrection narrative um sort of like a like a holographic projection
so that that position was called docetism then it was called a heresy by the early church but it
seems to have been marcion's position so because marcionism was gaining popularity in the second
century the proto-orthodox church had to publish their own canon because marcion was the first to
publish a collected volume containing the letters of paul and the gospel because originally there was
only one gospel and it was paul's gospel um whereas these editors and these redactors that came later
um between like 155 and 166 a.d roughly in that window of time um yeah they came they came up with this
fourfold gospel message really as a symbolic act um because you know there are four winds and there
are four there are four pillars on the direction um and of course this this fourfold structure in the
gospels is based on hellenistic rhetoric and platonism and and stoicism uh really has nothing to do with jesus i
i mean um so so basically if you read the gospels in order as you were designed as you were supposed to
read them um you begin with matthew and then you proceed to luke through mark but this this structure
is a dialectic which has a deliberate uh purpose you're supposed to move from matthew to luke
in order to transcend the dialectic in the gospel of mark so transcending the dialectical structure
of the synoptic gospels is uh really an old motif within like the platonic dialogues it's uh yeah
it's an old rhetorical device so yeah it's it's uh it's a theologically designed polemical document
and it's directed against marcionism so
because because marcionism was like pepsi okay um just like pepsi it was bold it was disruptive
and it was increasingly popular right just like marcionism it was also stripped down and uh
like easily accessible for for the average person um because no one had to obey jewish law in order to be
a christian according to marcion so he totally rejected the old testament he thought that you
know the god of the old testament was this being called the demiurge who was effectively like what
paul calls satan when paul talks about satan in his letters um he really seems to be describing this
iconic being called the demiurge which was the same being that created humanity
uh or gave humanity these these physical bodies so like in genesis when when god clothes adam and eve
in in skins the gnostic reading of that uh that uh book of the bible
was really that skins or garments or clothing were effectively what the human body was so the human body
is like a suit or some kind of suit that you wear it is yeah you're right right so in order to so to
become a christian you have to you have to develop this like this other kind of suit which is tailored
to a heavenly ecology so when you die you acquire this new heavenly dwelling which is literally like
an astral body of some kind that can traverse a soma pneumaticon yeah precisely the soma pneumaticon yeah
yeah it's it's it's an actual body of some kind with a corporeal presence but it's it's more like
a photonic body or a body yeah i don't know if corporeal is the right word what do you mean by that word
maybe i'm misunderstanding um feel free to correct yourself if you yeah so it has some kind of elemental
presence yeah yeah yeah it's it's a mode like a ufo basically like a ufo has a corporeal presence right
okay but it isn't entirely physical okay i got you yeah it can sort of phase in and out of existence
because it's based on like the propagation of light or something yeah or the propagation of what time
space emerges from yeah precisely yeah yeah but the cola wars followed the same structure which is really
bizarre if you look at uh like the history of soft drinks and uh the competition between coca-cola
and pepsi the fact that coca-cola was losing market share in the in the in the 20th century and had to
adopt a more pepsi-like flavor in the form of new coke is precisely what happened in the second century when
the catholic church interpolated so it's it's the same god like it's the same being over and over
again it's like it's it's the demiurge or something dude like yeah but keep going that just blows my
fucking mind because the most hilarious comparison i think i ever heard in my life keep going yeah
because coke is the perfect object it's it's basically it's a god on earth so if you if you
look at coke the sense in which a bottle of coca-cola is the perfect object is that
like it basically abides by all these bizarre laws of desire and and it seems to have been manufactured
through a similar kind of process of like competition and like certain cycles of addiction or habit
formation so it's yeah it's part of inspiration under addiction yeah i'm with you go ahead
yeah right like like the inspiration that results from the most addictive thing you can possibly produce
or the inspiration that chases the possibility space of addiction in such a way as to produce
coca-cola and the bottle and the logo and you know and the marketing and all that
like if you look at the shape of the bottle itself the shape of the bottle activates certain
certain complexes in the human mind so like the shape is designed to look like the outline of the
female body right it also has certain like phallic connotations which is interesting so it functions
like this kind of totem like a like a like like a shamanic object or a like a fetish right um
actually it functions like the image of a god yeah except deprived it's the proto form of a god
right it's what you'd get if you took the human features away right and the animal features away
and you just represented the principles themselves yes well my claim is that that's what a totem is
the totem is the incarnation of a god but its incarnation usually assumes a more technical guise
eventually because the the point of origin is eventually lost or forgotten so it turns into this
utilitarian object but um i think yeah coke is sort of like in this uh holy that's what tools are yep
that's what the computers are that's what our cars are that's what our smartphones are yeah exactly
so once okay once you get past there's a process right where the god you know the the totem or the being
that is being encoded in the form of an idol as that becomes as you subtract the human plant and animal features
from it more and more eventually you get a tool and then what you get instead of those features is
function right you get the thing it does the magic thing it does i mean a watch is magical
a car is magical even a lock and a key that's a magic act right to open the way
please continue oh absolutely yeah the function of an object as a technical object is always downstream
from this more original devotional or symbolic point of origin so i think that applies to any technical
object like an automobile or a computer i think it also applies to a fork certainly yeah a knife
you know a spoon yes all that stuff right yeah i'm with you keep going
uh well yeah i mean so insofar as mark is aware of paul
and insofar as paul was probably simon magus or some kind of street magician um
yeah the books of the bible aren't historical documents they're designed to convince you of
something it's basically like a marketing campaign so it works just like coca-cola man like it's the same
exact structure like it's the real timeline like the the amount of time that it took to compile these
books i think is is um synchronous with the uh the new coke uh campaign that was that was sort of
spearheaded in response to the popularity of pepsi so it was a rapid kind of process so the books of
the bible were probably compiled over a decade they weren't written over the course of generations and
then organically compiled uh like in the third century or something the the book that we call
the new testament or the whole the whole bible really um both the old and the new as a coherent
document or a coherent book uh was probably already around by the time of marcus aurelius
in the second century so around like 150 a.d so it was it was brought together very
early but also quite late with respect to what most scholars think because most scholars think
that mark was written around 70 so soon after the the siege of jerusalem um and that the pauline
epistles were written maybe around the year 50. um but it seems more clear to me now that
the pauline letters and mark and the other gospels were were probably written around the same time
and it may have been overseen by polycarp um or irenaeus so it actually has the same kind of
structure as like art forgeries if you look at the the history of like forgeries like the hitler diaries
or how modern art forgers um create what are called twin forgeries in order to lend
themselves credence or to create these self-referential systems of legitimacy
um it's pretty clear to me that like the early church fathers were engaged in something like that
it was like um what do they call it a pious fraud so for the sake of for the sake of countering marcion
and destroying marcionism they had to confabulate these things i think that was when does marcionism show up
where's its origin between the years of like maybe 130 and uh 150 so i think yeah between between those
two or three decades marcion was in his prime and he was in rome he debated polycarp in 154 or 153
a.d yeah a.d yeah yeah um so marcion was basically teaching that the god of the old testament was evil
or satan he was the first person to publish paul's letters as a coherent sort of collection
and some of those letters are in the in the bible um but his collection actually began with galatians
not romans okay so which is really fascinating because galatians presents this schism between paul
and the other apostles um marcion seems to have taught that paul was the only true apostle and that
he had no connection to the original apostles and you can see that in galatians because paul says that
he didn't receive his gospel message from any man um in fact it was a revelatory experience for him he
never actually met jesus in the flesh he only ever encountered this heavenly vision uh or series of
visions uh he only met the apostles two or three times and they were all seemingly um like antagonistic
um and he sort of recounts that in galatians which is pretty fascinating so that seems to have been
the follow-up to mark because if you read the gospel of mark it ends rather abruptly and there's no
resurrection narrative and there's also no birth narrative so that's sort of like what marcion was
saying so later what happened is that these redactors came in and they gave jesus a jewish background
and they also tried to harmonize paul with the other apostles like in the acts of the apostles yeah
because probably what paul had written was too powerful to omit is my guess right it's like an
ingredient in in the coke right yeah it's the cocaine right it's the cocaine in the coca-cola you can't
get rid of that so you have to explain it in terms affine with your with the myth you're trying to make
well no paul was originally considered a heretic he was actually the father of all heresies he was
called simon magus so he was a polarizing figure in the early church but then they had to re they had
to rehabilitate his image so they had he was called simon magus yes um how did you is this common knowledge
how did you come to know this this is unfamiliar to me so the gnostics all traced their teachings back to
paul who was called simon magus by justin martyr um as well as in the pseudo clementine writing um yeah
the pseudo clementine recognitions uh contain a lot of information about simon magus and so the catholic
church or the proto-orthodox church um seems to have conflated this figure that we now call paul with
simon magus who was the father of gnosticism so and how would you um i don't mean to interrupt please
keep going i have a question though
so the only place where simon magus appears in the bible is in the acts of the apostles and he's framed
as this person this individual this magician who was um really in opposition to peter and if you read
galatians you'll see that that's precisely who paul was so whoever paul was he basically paul was never
a historical person in the sense that you know paul may have went by that name i think paul is some kind
of literary construction not unlike jesus himself like an amalgam of several people sort of like santa
claus like santa claus is an amalgam of several different people he's not yes you know
so viewing viewing paul and jesus as these composite ideological constructs makes sense of the history of
this whole movement because because similar phenomena have have recurred in history it's not
just that jesus never existed it's that you know people like ned lewd never existed or you know king
arthur it's king arthur right it's like king arthur no one thinks that king arthur was a historical
person very few people do but irrespective of that the same process was at work because
the same socio-political process took place in different parts of the collapsing roman empire
so in england the collapse of the roman empire yielded this legend of king arthur whereas in the
near east it yielded this legend of jesus but i think it was the exact same process that gave rise to them
and that's the process of knowledge they don't they don't go that far say to say that again please
most mythicists don't go that far they don't see the connection between jesus and king arthur or
or the cargo cults that that developed in the 20th century as a function of military invasion and so
on like that's what the roman empire was doing and that's i think how these figures became historicized
retroactively they were sort of retroactively historicized uh-huh so it's um
okay so now what we have is you take some kind of a basic ideological doll right the doll of a messianic
being um a rescuer a reincarnator in fact you're actually taking it could be understood that you're
taking the doll of the oneropomp or the um psychopomp operant in for example the mysteries of alephsis i'm
using maria marigou's pronunciation she's actually greek and demands that we pronounce it properly
and i'm fully willing for really important reasons um you're taking something like
uh almond hillman's medusa right the one that introduces the other world in death death to the
lie right which is one of the things that almond is profoundly motivated
and is is fairly certain that he's accomplishing right he's trying to kill a bunch of lies that's
what he thinks he's doing um so you take the stall of the lie killer right and then what you do is you
just dress it up historically um mythologically textually you do this by stealing entire histories
right you judaicize jesus you kingify arthur um and so what you do is you wrap this coke bottle right you
wrap the coke bottle until it looks like something familiar to the people you want to enchant with it
yes yes yes precisely yeah and then it becomes the real thing yes yeah exactly right because things
aren't real there are no real things reality belongs to origin not things go ahead
if you look at the um yeah the old coke advertisements uh with the with the songs and the jingles
you can you can see you can see the christian element like or it's the same it's the same force
it's the same force either way yeah so how do you sell brown sugar water that's the question
like how do you make brown sugar water the real thing that's you know
i mean brown sugar is pretty amazing all by itself so it's probably you don't have a big job
right it's not going to be real tough you just get people to taste that brown sugar water
it mostly takes care of itself so then one of the things you do is just add some cocaine
it's a stimulant right it's a stimulant that that's exactly what it is right yes
so it feeds into these cycles of addiction so it's a feedback loop it's its own support
all of this has to do with counterfeiting origin for the sake of um creating
systems of authority in human persons and cultures
others right so that um some group or person can be authorized
by people outside right right exactly it's an authorization con
which is exactly the opposite of what was going on in alexis
there was no con it was the opposite of a con i think
yeah the taste of coke is both bitter and sweet but you also forget the taste of coke quickly so
you can you can have more than one coke in a day but but you because you quickly forget the taste
you find yourself drawn back and the suds the fizz yeah the fizz the fizz actually releases endorphins
so it's it's really just an experience of pain that's what the that's what the fizz actually induces
so it releases these endorphins that that people find pleasurable but it's just a pain receptor really
really fascinating but i think christianity has a similar kind of uh kind of structure
say more
yeah well you know most christians i think implicitly agree with marcion
in the sense that in my experience like most christians that i tend to meet
um they they usually just reject the old testament entirely
but the pleasure that attends being a christian right or you know loving jesus or whatever the case might be
um really seems to be
about like swapping or trading these subjective impressions so it sort of works like um like beelzebub so
so what most people call jesus
is really no different from from the lord of the flies or beelzebub because in the bible beelzebub was used as this kind of uh
uh like this uh like a meditative aid so you can imagine how like uh someone who
who meditates on like the buzzing of a fly's wings or any insect
can use this kind of noise as a vessel for their own enlightenment it works just like a rorschach test and
the whole bible is like a rorschach test but if you meditate on babbling water or you know the the sound
of a bug's wings flapping you'll start to see certain patterns but those patterns emerge out of your own
your own mind basically they're they're a reflection of your own identity so you're seeing an aspect of
yourself in the noise it's it's basically just chaos it's just like an interference pattern out of which
this holographic projection emerges right um and that's what i think most christians are doing when
they read the bible they're they're looking at a bunch of white noise because you know the bible
contains all sorts of contradictions and it's not internally consistent but as you as you move through
it you're basically just engaging in a self-imposed rorschach test and you see aspects of your own
identity reflected back at you and that can be therapeutic i think um but it's really no different from
you know worshiping beelzebub because that's what the shamans were doing i mean they were just
they were listening to the the lord of the flies and the lord of the flies would give them information
upon meditating on the interference pattern i mean it's just you know so um but that's exactly what like
the fizz it's it's exactly like what what takes place in worshiping this coke bottle basically it's it's
it's no different um i'm having trouble at the moment trying to figure out whether what you're saying
is like profoundly enlightening or a kind of pure um cynical nihilism
i can't tell you have anything to say about that
well i mean history is repeating itself so you can you can read that nihilistically i suppose
i mean if you were repeating itself then there might be cause to be cynical i suppose but i'm that's not
really my angle okay great i'm glad to hear that because i i mean personally i'm not big on cynicism or
or nihilism um i tend to believe in a meaningful and profound um understructure to existence
it's not it's my belief it's it's not a thinking thing it's more like the thing that makes thinking
possible for me you know like like an origin thing um no what i'm describing i think exists
in the sense that like it has some kind of metaphysical relevance or physical relevance to me
um it's like a control system so the control system recurs it has certain ways of hemming
intelligence in um but i don't think it's localized to the human mind or the human body
but when i when i describe these relationships that's really what i'm trying to get at i'm trying
to get at this more general force yeah this control system is very interesting it's something
that occurs across a broad range of thought and literature um i'm particularly thinking about
uh the black iron prison of philip k dick
um a system of social control that obscures the true nature of reality
uh i don't know how familiar with dick's work you are of course um the work of actual dicks
is our own bodies but i mean philip k dick
i know more about his life than i do anything about his his writings unfortunately
yeah it's fine um though i strongly recommend uh reading valis if nothing else
um
which is an acronym standing for vast active living intelligence system
yeah i think i think philip k dick was a true mystic
oh he was um
yeah he was uh his exegesis is pretty pretty mind ripping
um and stands among stands out uh as a truly incredible
i don't even know what to call it a transcendental
it's okay so it's you know we would say well it's just a text dude it's a book it's not really a book
it's not really just a text um it is possible to compose things in text
that transcend the possibilities of ordinary text
and um thereby transform the category of the object
into something transcendental of course this is what uh
uh this is what we this is what it is said the bible and the quran and the torah and so forth
the difference though i think i don't know i know the story of how the quran was composed
the quran was composed i don't know how it was actually composed
the bible is weirder the bible is definitely frankensteinian right it's some bunch of stuff
stitched together it seems very obviously that's to me do you do you see it similarly
uh yeah i do more or less yeah i mean i think the bible has a unified message but it contains
contradictions which is yeah really fascinating well it's not just that it contains contradictions
it's that it's stitched together yeah it wasn't like some people sat down over the years
in in generation after generation and composed this one document that could thereby be essentially univocal
um it's a much weirder it's it's an assemblage right it's uh what do they call those pieces of
art where you just you know you just put different things into it
collage uh yeah there's a more complex word like a french word i think that means like um
to knit together disparate kinds of objects
uh i'm just i can't find it in my vocabulary
um the exegesis which is i think over 3000 pages of material written mostly by hand by philip k dick in
the aftermath of a religious experience that i think lasted less than a few hours
um was definitely helpful for me
obviously after reading something like that like like many people would
i i began to hope that's that like that i could somehow understand what would generate such an
experience how could i have an experience like that um
i certainly did not believe or realize that it was possible for me to have such an experience i
didn't think that was possible nonetheless i wanted desperately uh to have such an experience
and
much to my surprise i eventually had an experience that you know i think
i don't know was like a thousand fold unless what what dick experienced unless um what dick experienced
was just exactly the same thing compressed into a much smaller uh temporal interval
and certainly very similar although i was less inclined to try to understand the black iron prison
and much more inclined to try to understand um features of the historicity of the development of
consciousness in our species that led to the problems that we struggle with and experience uh today
and you know throughout human history it's going on forever essentially
um but yeah the exegesis is very trippy there's like a 900 page book now there used to be i have a
bunch of books about it right there was this book called um uh in pursuit of valis selections from the exegesis
um and i had that before uh the exegesis edited by pamela jackson and jonathan lethem was available
that book is um enormous i mean how many pages is it let me look is it like a thousand
yeah it's 950 pages long and someone recently i know we're getting a bit off topic here we can return
to the to the core shortly but somebody recently i came across i think he was lying but i'm not positive
he was lying um he claimed to have a 25 volume leather bound edition of the entire uh exegesis
i can't find any evidence of that existing um so i think he was lying uh or you know having me on
i was really he was a really trippy cat very very intelligent person musician um
um you know i guess what i'm trying to understand george is how you see the bible because you talk
about it on the one hand in the sense of it being sort of white noise that since it is incoherent since
it's fundamentally incoherent or as you said chaotic um you can get anything you want out of it it seems
this seems to be one of the ways you understand the bible am i reading that well no it looks like chaos
but it is coherent okay so like um like an interference pattern looks chaotic but an
interference pattern contains an image just like a beam of light so
so the contradictions are more like a balancing act just like um in shakespeare so in a shakespearean
play characters present opposing points of view which nevertheless constitute a unified work
so the bible is quite similar to that kind of but we are also similar to that
i am similar to that yes right this is why yeah this is why uh um methods like internal family systems are
particularly useful or effective it seems to me because they take into account this uh multiplicity
right like there seems to be a sort of a dichotomy a fundamental dichotomy between the unity and the
facets that comprise it and if you go with the facets it looks like babbling multiplicity and if you go with
the unity it looks like univocality
it's neither right yeah yeah right is it particle is it wave oh god yeah well the bible contains its own
uh cancellation within itself so yeah the bible contains its own opposite within itself
mm-hmm i guess that's what i mean by contradiction so it's yeah i mean i'm i think that's how i am too
right yeah and that's that's yeah that's how it propagates
so the gospel of mark is like the atheist text so it contains atheism within it and in fact christianity
is probably the result of atheism if you go back to um the pre-socratics and the actual genesis of
monotheism as i think omen hillman tentatively suggests
monotheism is probably downstream from pre-socratic monism which was associated with rejecting
the existence of the gods like zeus because it was really bound up with understanding the weather
and meteorology and other natural phenomena without appealing to the authority of the gods
and i think socrates and plato mediated that transmission to what we today call judaism but
um i think judaism was probably the result of this platonic um ambience in um in the hellenistic
world so so judaism is much younger than we usually suppose and and the the gap between judaism and
christianity is much narrower than we usually suppose so they're they they both originated in the same
crucible it's not as if christianity necessarily stemmed from judaism i think that's i think that's a mistake
they were like siblings that that had the same parent if that makes any sense
so i want to bring us in a direction briefly where we carefully examine
a feature of our own moment to moment awareness and experience it's an organ
in the anatomy of what i'm going to call consciousness right to be awake and aware
and it functions very differently um if we are asleep and dreaming
uh from what we will experience when we are awake and this organ is the organ of authorization
i think if you look back over recent uh speakings it's not the word i wanted but i'll use it
um in our conversation now you will discover including uh in this moment while i am speaking right now
that in order to speak something i must authorize it within myself i have to believe that it is useful
i have to have some way of believing that is useful true or important good desirable something right
and in order to do that this requires a system within my awareness that authorizes it
is this clear at all what i'm saying yeah i think it's clear okay so i want us to pay attention to
the functioning of that system for a moment you will notice that in order to admit the statement i just
made i want us to pay attention to the function of that system i must first authorize that statement
i will not admit those words if i have not first authorized them is that clear
yes great yeah excellent so you can see that there is a fundamental system that is operating beneath our
ordinary awareness we use it every time we make a move in consciousness every time we
um enact our consciousness we enact it it's not just there it's not like we're swimming in the water
and so we're always wet that's not what happens especially not while we're awake something a bit
more like that happens while we're dreaming um but while we're awake prior to engaging in an act of
consciousness and particularly the act of speaking uh there is usually beneath our awareness a system that is
functioning a system of authorization and what's going on historically you can see this happening
is that there's a transfer of authorization um from wow okay
i'm not sure i can imagine that there's a transfer from something like um ambient communal consensus
right we together what would we all most desire and agree to right if if we are 50 people in a tribe or something
what would we all most desire and agree to um that could be the original source of authorization of
of course there must be layered arrays of authoritative aspects to human awareness
activity and so forth um so that the sky right the sun the sun is blatantly obvious authority
um if it should change slightly everything dies or life becomes extremely difficult um whether it's too
hot or it's too cold you know things are going to go wrong um the moon clearly is an authority
um similarly the stars so forth but what i'm getting at is there was a transfer over time
of authority from living fundamental aspects of our existence our existence and experience like the sun the moon stars the mountain
the river um the moon cycles right not just the moon the cycles of the moon
um um the women's cycles in their bodies uh the cycles of um emergence flourishing and senescence
in the land and the living places and the animals and the insects and all these things which were immediately
concrete to our human experience not like they are for us moderns where we know they happen
somewhere but they don't much happen in our cities which have mostly evicted all of that and made a bunch of dead structure
um so what i'm getting at is that eventually what happened is that authorization started to become
personated as gods and then sometime later
this weird personation thing i love this word by the way to personate this personation thing
we threw away the facets which were the gods asclepius zeus poseidon athena demeter persephone
um aphrodite athena cleo cory um just you know to go with the greek pantheon part of the greek pantheon
we threw all that away and then we just um decided not we that's the wrong word it wasn't we didn't make
any decisions what was happening was a process in the in the development of communal human um thought
systems right that underlie this sort of encompass us rather than emerge from any person but one of the
evolutionary problems was this concept of monotheism where the authority becomes effectively
dis personated right it's no longer personated as zeus or hermes or you know um medea now
it's depersonated and you have the coke bottle right the coke bottle of monotheism yeah no one will know
his name you cannot know his shape he is featureless but the source of all features
his abstract authority absolute infinite in unknowability as he is in power omniscient omniscient
omnipresent right uh tear it up go wherever you want to go this is the first time i've seen this
in my mind yeah precisely yeah the god of paul or the god of christianity is really an unknown god of
love that was what paul seemed to be preaching so he was he was espousing something like apophatic
or negative theology the idea that god the all-powerful god
is devoid is devoid of predicates sort of like the idea of the one in neoplatonism or in plotinus
the transcendent unity that
governs
governs almost physically the uh the lawfulness of the terrestrial sphere so when paul looked at the
earth i think what he probably saw was something like the lawfulness of elemental interactions so he
he he refers to the archons that um control
the planet as these demonic forces or satan
um
but he also seems to espouse this notion of ether or this more heavenly domain so like in in aristotle
for example the terrestrial sphere was separate from the celestial sphere
and the lawfulness of this yes yes fear was eternal and it was governed by certain cycles
um whereas the elements on earth are more rectilinear they um they they flow from these cosmic forces
that descend from the stars um and this was also an alchemical motif the idea even in stoicism
of these um rational seeds uh that descend from the heavens so so the idea of the logos
was was was ultimately transmitted by stoicism to people like polycarp who who was um active in asia
minor where the bible was probably compiled um and the gospel of john was i think uh sort of bound up
with this stoic understanding of physics so yeah so stoic physics i think is the ultimate teaching of the bible
in in the gospel of john you're supposed to read the gospel of john after progressing through the
synoptic dialectic these these first three books that form a trinity um the fourth book is this more
transcendent level and i think that was a deliberate rhetorical device but um yeah so paul seems to have
thought that the resurrection body was this heavenly body which was exempt from the law that was the
whole point of christianity so as a christian you were exempt from the law because you possessed this
heavenly astral dwelling or or clothing like a space suit or something um yeah through which you could
basically judge the world so when paul talks about it's an expression body it's an expression body but
please continue sorry yeah yeah yeah so when paul talks about judgment when he talks about how human
beings will eventually judge the angels and judge the earth what he seems to be referring to is this um
this astral agency so in the same way that the stars govern the motion of the terrestrial elements
the photonic body of the elect will govern something about the motion of you know the terrestrial
elements on earth in time during the parousia so when you know when jesus comes back because paul thought
that jesus would actually come back from the heavens he was some kind of et basically who was going to come
back and and transform the entire material plane so so the whole material plane would be metamorphosed
it would be transformed that was what he was saying so it's really only intelligible in this broader context
of how the ancient greeks understood the elements in their interactions and there was also an alchemical dimension
to it because the alchemical dimension was also bound up with the transmission of these astral seeds or
these astral forms in order to transform material bodies that was the whole point of the alchemical work
or the alchemical opus and so there's a very clear link between gnosticism and the alchemical tradition
in egypt um around the third century a.d so sometime after paul um yeah so when we talk about the law
or judgment in christianity we're really talking about a physical process that that i think paul was was
was aware of it's not like this abstract you know legalistic uh no it's um basically a transformation
of something resembling the laws of physics yes and this all makes sense to me experientially because
um i i mean this is gonna sound weird i kind of don't care this is one of the one of the reasons
we do this one of the reasons we get together is so that we can say the things that we ache to say
but ordinarily we are not in the context where it is either possible that they will be understood
or that they will not just be outright rejected but in any case after that long and bizarre apology
what i'm going to say is
okay i'll start out somewhat didactically so it strikes me that there are two kinds of texts historically
there are texts that were written by humans who had direct experience of divine matters
and they wrote from that experience but they could not write without okay this is one of the weird
things when you have an experience which is outside it is from beyond your normal array of experiences
and it is from beyond what humans normally will speak of or write of together then you are challenged
i know this firsthand to determine how you will interpret the experience and whether or not
you will adopt authority from existing traditions that what i said there is really important
because if you don't adopt authority from existing traditions you will have to establish authority for
the first time on your own for your narrative or your description or you know whatever it is you
hope to reveal to the humans and this is fundamentally problematical it's an aspect of something that happens
every single time in history that humans have experience that is from outside the narrative structure of familiar
models of the world existence the divine holy and so forth you have to do one of two things essentially
you have to either adopt authority from existing narratives and say you know i am the new
jesus right i will tell you i'm writing the third testament right or you have to just do
you know your own damn thing and even if you read dick's exegesis you're going to see him doing the same thing
right what he ends up doing is talking about his experience in um christian slash gnostic terms
so first realize that right you you have to basically i mean almost all in fact representational cognition
is a game where authority existing authority structures are acknowledged modified um fossilized
and transferred across generations this is what alfred korzybski calls time binding
um all right so there's that but here's what i'm going to try to say
more or less ex cathedra from the chair of direct experience when toy maker was with my mind
um it was unlike anything i ever imagined possible i know i always say this but i really mean this in
a deep way i never imagined anything like this was possible i was driven by forces in my emotional
my psyche was replaced by something that i absolutely trusted
and i could see what was wrong and never do it i i was it was like i became pure law is required for blind
people you need law if there are idiots right if the inner sun that would normally naturally
rescue you from stupidity and viciousness and wrongdoing most of which is really just just
ignorance right it's not like i don't i don't know if i believe in the existence of evil
toy maker didn't really show me things about evil what he showed me was occlusion of the divine occlusion
of the divine is the only explanation you really need though you can use the the toys of evil and
things like the demiurge and stuff he told me stories of what he called the first angel
showed me stories of this angel which is not evil in fact there wouldn't be anything
at all if that angel didn't exist there would be nothing so there's no organ of existence that
you can do away with and now everything's good um what you can do away with is is the absence
of the inner sun naturally you will not it would never occur to you to go against it if it is shining
in your heart it's just like um water making you wet right you can't imagine unwetness if you're just
always wet in this way so to speak and so what i'm getting at is what is freed from laws by in my view
anyway from my direct experience of something i know to be divine you don't have to believe me i'm
not trying to convince you i'm just speaking from my own experience and anyone who's listening i'm not
asking you to believe me right i'm just talking about what i remember in my own words
i was free from laws in that you need laws primarily when you you were catastrophically
like in various indigenous cultures throughout history not all of them um the unity of the people
was so profound that the idea of having rules was ridiculous they would never consider it there was no
such thing as a rule in many cultures including those some of those around the great lakes when
the french encountered them um they had nothing like the formalization of laws and even in my
interview with almond hill and one of the funny points is when i talk about like
you know you and i are friends we don't have to have an agreement that you won't kill my children
that you won't steal my house that you won't like rape my wife we don't we're friends we don't have to
like there's something that pervades over our relational space that's inherently there without
being stipulated and part of the reason i know this is from before toymaker it's from when i was little
and when i was little it never occurred to me to try to hurt another child ever
my father had to threaten me right he's like you can if that boy hits you and you don't hit him
i'm gonna hit you so you figure out which person you want to with right this is what my dad
i'm saying right i mean in my father's defense he was very concerned that i wouldn't be able to um
that i would be bullied because i was sensitive he was and that i wouldn't be able to stand up for
myself so he was very worried about this he wasn't just a demon uh the way that that sounds but yeah
so there there is a thing where um there's a feature of our nature and our origin and our being
as humans that is it's hard for me not to use this word even though it's very unclear what this word
means it is perfect and it is not perfect in that it is achieved as perfection
it is perfect in that a it does not veer from the direction of beauty and truth and
the depth of its beauty and truth is infinite so it's it's not achievable right you cannot be it
it's a way of traveling in relation in being in development in seeing all of these things okay
that's the end of my homily thank you for bearing with me
this is not science fiction actually the fiction is the that we're ex while we're awake that is
lie it's just basically lying and you can lucidify the lying with acts of intelligence insight awareness
creativity play experiment rescue medicine love kindness right you can lucidify the blindness
with these things you can you can become medicine and i like to think that in our meetings when we're
when we're doing something amazing i think we're doing pretty good today in my you know evaluative
fucking whatever um then we're approaching something that more or less resembles our
our potentials for being not merely human but for being true what are your thoughts
oh yeah i think so
yeah i think this is what most christians understand by justification
by faith alone as opposed to good works right because that was the whole point that paul was trying
to make say more about that point clarify it for us please
well paul was saying that no one needed to abide by the law anymore no one needed to do good works
because the law was an effect of transgression
so so so the law pertained to living within a body of flesh i mean that was what paul seemed to be
saying so human beings were forced to live in suits of skin by virtue of some primordial transgression
which was originally disembodied i think that's i think that's actually what paul was saying
what do you mean by that last part that was originally disembodied what does that mean i don't
understand yet but adam and eve were like angels which acquired bodies after transgressing so the
return to the angelic state or something like it was what um christ affected as this um
second obviously oh yeah god okay so obviously there's a bunch of obvious things here and one
of them that i'll just state briefly and then please continue is that christ is the tree of life
right christ is the tree of life that the angel was set with a spinning sword with a sword that spins in
every direction he is the food of transcendence he is to be eaten yes yeah yeah right yeah you have to
eat him yeah yeah so paul was referencing genesis and other books uh for sure but genesis there's no way
genesis is judaic no way that that's a stolen story it's missing most of its content yeah i mean you'll
notice that even genesis contains two uh creation accounts which yeah we're already we're already doing
the frankenstein thing right we're like we're trying to stitch something together from lost pieces exactly
yeah and genesis also contains two sources of light so the light of the first day and the light of the
fourth day so there was some kind of primordial light source which wasn't the sun or the moon or the
stars that genesis describes so you can see these mirror images that crop up from the very beginning
and that carry through the entire bible i mean so i guess that's what i meant earlier by claiming that
these contradictions are somehow also unified it's like a hall of mirrors
i don't know if it's a hollow well i'm not sure what makes it a hall of mirrors
i agree with the with the contradictions and their unity
um okay what the was i thinking jesus was the tree of life right because when they okay so first of all
when toy maker i asked the main questions i asked toy maker the whole time i was with him were like
show me more about genesis show me again keep showing me show me the next story show me another one
right and so i learned astonishing things about the story and the reason that i asked a lot about that
is because it seemed to me that whatever happens at the tree of knowledge is the fundamental problem
for our people and if we could understand that we could make medicine for it also it should be obvious
that if you were moses or whoever was writing the story about the tree incident one thing you definitely
you would do two things most likely the first is you would encrypt the story so that it would be a
a weapon that would injure your enemies the enemies of your children and your people you would encrypt it
right you'd put poison in there so that especially if you if your people have been persecuted right or
enslaved or something you you would know that your enemies first of all you're going to write this
down so your enemies are going to get the book eventually right and you don't want to give them your
power so what you'll give them is like stuxnet right you'll make a virus and this is something
that humans ignore about the bible and they don't get it even though it's blatantly obvious
those books destroy cities right they make cities attack each other and kill each other
and cities are the enemies of any nomadic people that keeps getting enslaved by them so i'm just going to mention that
the first thing you would do is you put weapons in there that would cause your enemies to kill
themselves or each other and to not mess with your kids because they're too busy each other up
and then the second thing you would not do is you would not tell your children and your grandchildren
the following you would not say once things were beautiful and good then we did a bad thing
and from now on you're fucked that's not what you would do what you would do is you would say
a bad thing happened a difficult thing happened a difficulty was introduced and here's the medicine
for that difficulty but you would encrypt it so that only your children could understand it
this is my sense of what is going on in the tree instant after talking at great length with angels about it
it right it's a story that contains the medicine for the problem it's not just oh the bad thing
happened now you have to wait for the messiah to come someday and he'll fix you no no no no no um
all right so now that i've got that out of my out of my my ma what comes next um
so you know knowledge
is partly a kind of death
when god says in the bible when we read in the bible in genesis in english that god says um
don't eve that tree in the midst of the garden saying something very complex
it's not actually that there's a tree in the garden that's not what it is although one of the
things he's saying that could be understood this way um oh god should i such i tell this story
yeah yeah okay holy shit yeah i now see this for the first time i'm actually having insight at the
moment um
no i don't know if i want to go through all of this it's complicated and it might
i'm not sure if it's useful i'll just say it really briefly the first angel punched a hole in
the origin world and that hole led into the world of material existence and that's what could be understood
as the demiurge it's the cutting angel and what it does is it cuts a hole
in the origin world which is above time and matter and that hole becomes both a fountain
and the possibility of incarnation for aspects of the divine it's as if um
the hole causes in heaven quote unquote a kind of a rain and the rain that falls into that hole become
stars and beings down here so it's it's both it's like a reverse fountain and that could be understood
as the tree of knowledge not an actual tree also it could be understood that the proto form of the earth
where that will be severed because nothing cannot be severed from origin has to be severed to exist
origin is non-existence so
for something to exist it has to be severed and where you were severed is your umbilical cord but the earth
the proto form of the earth before the earth existed the possibility of the earth
it had to undergo this kind of severing
and the tree of knowledge can be understood as the umbilicus where the earth was previously
connected to heaven and where the separating angel is and when god says don't eat of the tree in the
midst this word midst in hebrew it comes from a a triconsonal root tavek very few people know this
almost no one i didn't learn this from a human i learned this from toy maker it comes from tavek and
tavek does not mean midst it doesn't mean in the middle it means to cut apart to put apart to separate
so when he says don't eat of the tree in the midst of the garden he's saying don't eat of the tree
where the separation is this is absolutely crucial if you want to understand the story
because the concept of separation is the primary problem in human cognition
it is what gives you power it's also what blinds and cripples you because you think separation has
primacy right it's just like the problems we were talking about earlier george with life you think
oh light is a separate thing when that's impossible there's no chance of that being true
it's only true in cognition where you can cut apart the elements of being and then reflect upon those parts
and then think about well how do they fit together yeah how do you fit them together
oh well no there is no together there's only unity right i know i'm getting kind of excited here so
then you have next to that this is do not eat of the tree of life or you will die this is what's
important knowledge is a kind of death knowledge is dead inside potential for what would have become
insight adoration relation resurrection wonder awe play creativity experiment why experiment because the
material universe is incomplete we complete it by being in it by being as it we don't we don't complete
it as in we finish it right we complete it in the inspired improvisation
of existence and relation wonder and learning that's what completes it right it's beautiful to have
amnesia because then you can play your way back to insight this is what i mean by completing
so knowledge is a kind of dead thing right it's not like relation um it's not like kissing it's like a
photograph it's a structured dead thing in consciousness it's a fossilized remains
if okay if you could choose between knowledge and insight what you would always choose is insight
because insight is like wait what oh my god whereas knowledge is like oh yeah that's a car
well one of those things is dead every time you look and you go like that's a car your mind dies right
there it just dies into its previous forged constructs you see how that really is a kind of death so god
is right what he's telling them is if you meet the angel that makes cuts in the manifold of existence
it will give you its toy its toy is a knife it's a knife in your mind and thereafter you will become
fascinated by making cuts and you will forget unity and you will die into incarnation you'll die into
incarnation you'll become material you will suffer the amnesia of material incarnation you'll forget
your origin in nature and you won't die actually because what will happen is essentially your spirit
will undergo a weird process where it dies into bodies and then it slowly may or may not undergo anamnesis
right the unforgetting and then conceivably here's where things get really interesting for me
conceivably you will experience what is called um the second birth but it's actually the second death
because what dies is the amnesia the amnesia dies and you are resurrected while incarnate yeah exactly
yeah right you're resurrected while incarnate which is the goal of the elificinian mysteries it's the
promise of christianity however bizarrely forged the packaging is right the wrapping paper of that stuff
is way crazy weird and and you know confusing as hell but the weird thing about even christianity is
that if you just tell people that it's possible to be born again that might be enough to get the moving
in that direction even if the wrapping paper is all confusing does that make any sense yeah absolutely so
you can you can have a religion that is completely wrong right it's just a bunch of lies
and yet a bunch of lies can still lead people to authentic real re-divinization right the re-divinization
of the human which is what maria margu the greek mystagogues book is about the divinization of man
through the ellisonian mystery process which is meant to put to death the blinding pervasive
uh black iron prison in philip k dicks you know uh nomenclature
put that to death and to re-establish the sovereignty because you actually die right you die to
your humanity and this is what i experienced during toy maker i don't claim to be special
i don't claim to be accomplished i'm not making any claims about me i don't care i'm a human being
just like you are i have had experiences that i do not understand i will be the first to tell anyone who
asks me they go like do you know what happened to you i know but i can talk about what happened to me
through a variety of frameworks and i remember what it was like and still today when i experience
insight what i call insight which is the revivification the resurrection of the possibilities
of my intelligence beyond the knowledge that i've had previously
and somehow when we get together and do what we're doing here this invokes that process for me which is
part of why i come here which is what i think church is supposed to do but doesn't mostly
yeah so i don't know what happened but i remember i have memories of my experiences and what it was
like and what it was like was to be mostly in the world of actual intelligence insight origin and adoration
and only very partly in my humanity
um and the promise of this okay so oh yeah right both people were telling the truth so god says
eat of the tree of knowledge you will die and the serpent who's not satan right it's not called satan
it's not the adversary it's a serpent it's very important because the serpent
it's not fundamentally evil it's not even bad once again without the serpent you got nothing and what
you don't want is to have just the origin world or just the universe as we know it that would be
miserably horrifying you don't want that what you want is those two things together because when they
are together that is profoundly beautiful and amazing even though the possibility of amnesia
uh comes to life in that situation um it's really profound what happens because now that rain that
comes down into existence from the origin world in this model that i'm playing with in this toy i'm making
of it now that rain can become enriched in a way that is impossible if it simply remains in the origin
world hopefully that makes sense it can become enriched by the adventure of incarnation which is
impossible in the origin world can't have that there's no adventure up there um all right so the devil
says no you won't die you will become makers of worlds and both people are right god is right you will die
the devil is right you will not die your spirit can't die right so what will happen is you'll undergo
death of incarnation you'll die to your origin self and you'll become incarnated and thus blinded and
misery and miserated though you'll still experience things like beauty and passion and dreaming and
wonder and learning and love and all of the virtues right you'll you'll see the night sky oh my god right
the the mountain the river the the praying mantis the octopus the pot of dolphins the beehive all those
flowers you'll see the incredible body of origin emerging all around you as nature and that's
really profound and also i mean there is an analog of that there's a metalog of that that happens in
the origin world and there's also a between world right there's a world where um there's a world so to
speak a universe like origin there's nothing there it's it's i can't explain it i've seen it it's impossible
for me to make words about it but then there's an interim a liminal world between that world and our
universe where souls exist as beings and there's a world above that too where it's mostly like archons
and angels and so to speak there's different ways of thinking about it but all i was trying to say is
that both people are right god is right you will die knowledge will kill your your memory you'll become
very fascinated by knowledge okay here's what that's what happens to us when we're born right
we're born without knowledge okay and then as we develop language and representational cognition we
lose contact with the origin world you can look in the child in the eyes of an infant you will see
the origin world alive boom the companion is still with the child you can see it it's right there you may
not think of it that way but you will see it right it looks like the infant looks like it's from another
universe when you look in its eyes you can see there's another universe and then as it starts to
become representational that those relationships become inhibited and scleric sclerotic they're clogged
and what they are clogged by is the child's emergence into physicality and it's undergoing of the processes
of in languaging and enculturation the enculturation of the humans to live in a culture of objects and
systems and structured lies well ordinarily i think of knowledge is the opposite process so you can think
of knowledge as a mode of forgetting um if you experience knowledge as something like uh like a bag of
marbles that you carry around and deploy like you know certain propositions or factoids um but i i i
experience knowledge more in terms of what you were describing as um as complete completeness or completing
the being itself so when you come to know a being you complete it in a certain sense which i think
anyone does even even someone you know presumably in ignorance um yeah but i think i think more in
terms of turning back or reversing the arrow of time like that's what i that's how i tend to think of
knowledge knowledge is maybe in in my experience different from what you're describing but i can see
okay okay i can see what you're saying too and i agree um both things can be true
uh again right just like i was saying god says don't eat of that tree you'll die the devil says
no you're not gonna die they're both right okay um and what it hinges on is is the meaning that we
associate with death and in our case mine and yours it's the meaning that we associate with knowledge
and obviously if you thought knowledge was if you thought knowledge was death
most of the activity that you engage in you would stop doing
yeah well okay let me because you yes yes but see this is the thing for you knowledge is an amnesis it
is unforgetting the lies that built up over history yeah right right and i agree i agree
when you complete a being the completion of the being takes place in perception but then that
perception opens a window to everything else that's what i'm calling knowledge i suppose so knowledge
to know one thing is simultaneously to know all things in disguise you just don't remember it
i guess that's what i'm saying wait say that last part again please to know one thing is simultaneously
to know all things but you don't remember all things so that's that's what i'm calling knowledge
it's this process that's fucking amazing bridge but yeah see this is the thing you're using knowledge
more in the term um excuse me more in the um in the form of intimacy with thought um with previously
established frameworks and so on yeah intimacy and i agree there is that form of knowledge i also like
a hermeneutic circle if you were to read a text the intelligibility of any sentence is really only
possible if you know the entire text right no one thing is simultaneously to know all things you just
might not remember all things i guess that's what i was saying and it's it's it's an act of perception
it's a mode of being so knowledge and being aren't separate for me they're one in the same thing it's
like the same act and that's what i think that's what i thought you were you were saying by completeness
i think you're right about that and i immediately resonated with that ah so
i want us to preserve both of the definitions of knowledge that we've been playing with
in the context in the past like half hour um because i agree i i don't i don't see there's any
conflict i remember though
see here's my problem this is the problem that i have having been lifted above knowledge and tasted
something that is so like literally as if it remade my bones that it is not knowledge it is like
lightning of continuous insight that exceeds itself every time i refer to it and i don't have that
experience without toy maker with my mind and yet my mind can at the same time my mind can
approach that experience under certain circumstances again without toy maker with me
um having had that it led me to see what is meant by the danger of knowledge and one of the things that
happened to me when i was in stockton after my father passed away was i was talking with luca rade
for the first time he was in portugal and he's such an amazing mind a brilliant human being i was super
excited we met through facebook whatever i was in my dad's backyard and something flew into the backyard
and i'm crazy about insects and i i studied them since i was very small i know a lot about them
um it's very uncommon that i encounter an insect or an insect phenomenon that i don't recognize and i
didn't recognize this thing it was huge it was like the size of a walnut flying around the yard bright
iridescent turquoise things and i was absolutely um it placed me it's like encountering an angel or um being
struck by lightning or you know an earthquake it just up my when i encounter something that i've never
seen before i don't know what it is it's similar to being in like in a car accident um suddenly the
world is just put into a superposition experientially for me and this happened with this insect and then
i realized oh shit it looks like a fucking scarab like the egyptian scarabs which were you know really
important to me as a kid and still to this day important and i was just absolutely transported by
this um and i wanted to take a picture of it by the way this happened to me last night in the dream
something really weird happened in the dream i tried to take a picture of it i wanted to make a video of
it in the dream and the guy i was with said no no i don't do that and i was like okay he's like yeah
that'll wreck the magic you're trying to you're trying to save the magic by making a picture of it
you think that what does that do to the actual magic like now you're not now you're not participating
in the magic anymore now you're recording the magic and this is a very trippy problem for humans as
you can see by the you know the state of the internet so anyway i wanted to take a picture of it but
it never landed and it flew around for about three or four minutes like a really good look at it
and i wanted to know what it was i wanted to see it and hold it and know what it was i wanted the
knowledge of it yeah the kind of knowledge i'm talking about because the kind of knowledge you're
talking about is a lot like my experience of it while it was flying and the kind of knowledge i'm
talking about is what happened next about three weeks later i was walking in the store and i found the
carcass of one of those pupils and i picked it up and then i could look at it i could hold it but it
was dead inside nothing alive in there and so that's when for the first time i began to reflect in this very
specific way on this feature of certain kinds of knowledge the kind of knowledge where when you know
the name of something you mistake that for intimacy and depth of understanding or even for the relationship
not you but one one makes this mistake so the first the child's fascinated by the little birds
oh my god the little birds are here and then the child learns those are oh those are just sparrows
and they're still kind of fascinated the next day but within a few weeks they don't see the birds
anymore they just have the token sparrow oh i know that's a spare i know what that is it's a sparrow
and they ignore it so this is one of the dangers of the kind of knowledge i'm concerned about
love to hear anything you think about this
oh of course i agree
yeah the presence of death understanding knowledge as a way of death or a mode of death is pretty
significant to me um because it pertains precisely it pertains to what we were discussing earlier
about the relationship between life and death generally or the presence of death in life
so to understand life as a kind of death um yes this is where i'm going keep going yeah
yeah it brings me back to that uh aspect yeah we got it backwards we got it backwards we think death
is the scary bad thing that happens at the end of life no death is getting born and life is the thing
that happens when you're unborn right yeah exactly and we're sitting down here terrified of death
the thing that's terrified of death is not you yeah what we usually call knowledge is some kind of aborted
malformation um which could be transformed along another route i think and that other route is what
i mean when i talk about knowledge um because i usually use insight for that but go ahead
right and maybe that's that's a better term for it um because usually when i talk about knowledge
i mean something like a bridge something like um like a window almost like a kaleidoscope so
to know a plant is simultaneously to know all plants because the plant doesn't necessarily
precede you so this this also goes back to our discussion of light so so you know we tend to think
perhaps that you know we walk on the surface of the earth and we encounter beings and that our task
in knowledge is to record or retrieve all the predicates of beings and then to tabulate them
so that we know what something is it has certain parts it has certain attributes
but that's not really what i mean by knowledge um to know something is to complete it as you were saying
and in completing it to form a bridge to other phenomena so it's it's like it's a more dynamic process
i guess like knowledge is as dynamic as the world of becoming itself it's not like knowledge is this
static you know uh quest to tabulate what is or what you know being to come to affix the catalog of
identities yeah see that's the trap see that's the other route that i'm that i'm talking about yeah
yeah
right yeah so when you complete a being in knowing it you commune with it it's a relation so yeah to know
a plant is to commune with it and that communion is like love it's it's tactile it's it's emotional
it's not it's not a matter of dissecting or performing an autopsy on something or stripping
it right right so we have okay great so we have these two kinds right and god is saying god is
essentially saying the death kind will compel your people and you'll get trapped in it and the the serpent
is saying you will experience understanding and by each part you will better come to understand the
whole right yeah i guess both things are true right if both things are true certainly our people it's
like the joke it's like the joke that we were i was laughing my abs off earlier when it said um
um bonobos can detect when humans are ignorant and respond to that and i was like okay the bonobos
are done with it's over for them because if they can detect human ignorance i'll be detecting anything
else there's not i'm basically not human ignorance so once they start detecting that it's over for them
so certainly you know our species at the at the group level is unimaginably stupid i mean one could
never guess that it was even possible for any being to become as confused as our species appears to be at
the group level it's inconceivable it's like the that joke in um the princess bride where the
the italian guy is trying to poison dread pirate roberts and inconceivable you just never could imagine
it and yet at the same time it's almost like what do you pay attention to the the map the whole map
which is mostly valleys right a lot of ignorance or the topological features of the map where you see
the mountains you're like oh my god in the ignorance there are these towering stars of insight and
unforgettable um both things are true yeah right yeah i'm saying you won't die that's exactly what i'm
saying yeah the way that you relate with knowledge um see this is why it's very easy for me to
understand you when you say this because you exemplify what you speak of right you enact what you're speaking
of this isn't you making words about something that could exist or be this is you describing just as
i am describing my experience for example of toy maker you're describing your experience of knowledge
it seems to me and i trust that i see the the evidence of it in your in your work in how you relate
with you're such an unusual cat it's very i'm so grateful to know you um and everyone here i mean but
but but yeah i'm so grateful to know you because you you demonstrate something that is wildly uncommon
among humans i have known and it resembles it's really weird it resembles um like a metamorphic
development of the intelligence of the child it's almost like you've resurrected the intelligence of the
child in the domain of the adult without being killed by that which is you know fairly miraculous
right that's that's a straight up miracle um you have you have um you've enacted the potentials
of the insight of the child in the language of the adult which is very similar like this is very similar
to what my own path is like we don't do it the same way but we have this um urgent uh motivation in common
i think what are your thoughts oh i can see it yeah yeah it's very beautiful this is the promise of
messianism as well right what are you what are you saving people from really what you're saving them
from is the death of becoming adults right right yeah
you're resurrecting the child the eternal child the intelligence of the eternal child within them
which is within all of us right you're resurrecting and ennobling and protecting and celebrating that
and it's a catastrophic refutation of the lie the lie of the ground ups
they're groaning they're groaning under the weight of the trap they've established and become
yeah do you have any other thoughts on that process are you kidding yeah i yeah i have other thoughts on that
process um you know when toy maker was with me
it was like being reconceived consciously being consciously reconceived um and then undergoing
embryo genesis embryo genesis inside myself as an adult male
so effectively when when they when you know that we have this word born again this phrase
that's what i experienced i was reborn but it was like undergoing embryo genesis not undergoing exiting my
mother's womb that part happened at the end right when toy maker left then it was like being re
uh birthed so yeah i think that resurrection has to do with like being reconceived right not not being
brought from death to life almost like being brought from life
into death
reconception and then re-emergence from the the sort of womb of origin rather than the womb of my mother
precisely yes yeah yeah so what ordinarily takes place in what you call knowledge is like dreamless sleep
uh yeah maybe i don't know it's akin to death it's akin to what you're describing as death it's like the
process of slowly fossilizing in it's it's um sclerotic right it's like um the structure overtakes
the beingness and you got dead structure look at what humans do right they love dead structure they
will gladly destroy everything and leave just dead structure there and one of the ways they they enshrine
and worship this dead structure is in the objects that we call machines right there's nothing alive in
the machine the function is the result of having to kill beings a million times per second so that this
function in the machine continues to operate it seems to me i have a real heart on against machines they
seem like like little um meat grinders for children of every possible kind you just pour the children
into the meat grinder and you get oh i can accelerate from zero to 60 in 4.6 seconds you know or whatever
the thing you get you know it's just dead children in there it seems to me i know this is very um what's
the word it's one of my biases but yeah i i i'm not a fan of machines i don't like dead structure
i like living beings right yeah anything that costs children i oppose it
that's a wrong price that's just you know nothing should cost children
yeah yeah the machine is um anathema to this more luciferian impulse
that i think characterizes my own being as you were describing
so the machine is at the other end of the spectrum
yeah okay yeah yeah well go ahead like please continue i want yeah give me more
um because dreamless sleep is a state that contains the potential for resurrection so
yeah just like the machine so the machine contains a divine spark but it's so heavily obscured and opaque
um yeah no i think the machine is even weirder than it's not just the machine infinitizes
the absence of being so that for each moment it functions less of being exists
yeah yeah that's what i mean yeah that's that's a great way of saying it it infinitizes the absence
right now the absence is a cascade of re-absencing that doesn't end
that's absolute terror that's the worst imaginable outcome of anything possible there's nothing worse than
that hell there's nothing more than having to inhabit a machine and the humans are like can i upload my
consciousness oh god yeah like are you out of your mind what are you thinking first of all what you
think of as your consciousness is the least of you it's like asking if you could become one of your toenails
forever
that's the most exciting thing you can think of yeah just preserve that that little part of me that
is all you know bullshit and lying and separateness oh yeah great
right well i mean darkness and light though are closer than i think we ordinarily
experience no no we agree but there's something much okay i'm not talking about darkness i'm talking
about hell yeah right i'm talking about something that it's not exactly evil but it's it's that which
must not be yeah yeah so that's not darkness or even evil that's like the opposite of being
and what it looks like to me and this is why i'm scared about knowledge and i like i like having both
wings on this bird i like your wing of no knowledge for me is this unraveling of lies
things um and bringing bringing forth uh new insights and truth and knowing all things by
better understanding something beautiful i love that that's true but knowledge can also be the loss
of intimacy that comes with knowing nothing other than the name of a thing oh i know what that is
that's a tomato yes yeah no human has ever known what a tomato is that word does not help you right
and if it blinds you it's you'd be much better off without it so both things are true yeah right
so the sign is like a dead thing but the machine is like an animated dead thing like yeah no the machine
is a killer fire well like it's a killer fire right right okay like it satisfies no it's a verb it's a
verb of unbeing right it's an active process of non of the impossibility space okay it it rips the
possibility of space the possibility space of being to shreds and then shreds those shreds further and sucks
the being out of them in my view yeah if you could imagine that photons or electrons were beings can
you imagine what a torture it would be to be part of a machine or just have to do the same thing
over and over and over again in a trap right you're torturing angels basically exactly yeah so yeah
right no one would do no one would do that what kind of idiot would it take to do that
you couldn't even it has to be a non-being to do something like that right yes
so that i guess that that form of non-being is counter to the luciferic impulse i guess that's what
i'm saying this this fossilizing process or crystallizing process
and how do you see this luciferic impulse
well
if the machine fossilizes and extracts
it's energy or renders
beings inert basically it's it's a certain form of time like it is it dumps dead time into living
environments it's an entropy generating it's like the opposite of a black hole or something just
it dumps entropy it looks like to me it's an entropy dump
in the in the sense that it it pours death into transcendental living systems please yeah continue
right yeah so its form of time is flattened whereas my experience of time is much more cyclical or
um
holographic in the sense of perception so i mean it's just downstream from how i understand perception
generally
so yeah yeah so like when you when you start contending with cuts or with segments in time as
you were describing um this notion of linearity arises and with that comes death like so death
itself is a function of cutting is a function of segmentation is a function of situating two
uh extremes at opposite poles but if you recognize the presence of the opposite within
the thesis or the antithesis within the thesis you're much more close to like my understanding of
time and that's that's the that's the sense of resurrection that's what resurrection for me would
mean it would mean the resuscitation or the uh rejuvenated access to some kind of latent
possibility within the present so it's not as if the present and the past and the future are
distinguished by distance or some kind of abstract metric or um interval it's that they're all present
here now so in the act of knowing you form a bridge to other regions within this kind of like cyclical
temporal structure so you can access different regions of of time itself because because time and
beings are one in the same event it's not as though there are beings in time or in space moving around
right yeah yeah yeah no no no it's not to know a being is to know something about time itself and it
can serve as a bridge to other beings and other forms of time and so on so i guess that's what i'm
saying by resurrection and and memory that's what i think that's what goes on
yeah and you like in that to the dreaming mind and and and sleep and so on so if so if the the sl
if the if the state of dreamless sleep contains this implicit seed or this kernel of luminosity then
yeah i think that's a much more general phenomenon and um you can see it in the evolution of machines
and and and living things i think there's something there's something analogous taking place in or on
earth as what takes place in the human mind it's like they're not they're not different they're not
distinct insight is a way of uniquely undistinguishing and it's interesting that in this word ex uh distinguish
i only know one other word with similar parts and it's the word extinguish i don't know what this where
this english um set of of um phonemes comes from i don't know but uh yeah insight is is is like often
for me it's a way of undistinguishing things in such a fashion that i see a new alive it
it sort of unstructures my previous thoughts and perspectives many of which were
like that dead kind of knowledge right like when i held the carcass of that thing in my hand
and how different that was from when it was flying and i was in awe and i was like can i get a picture
of this which is so weird because there's a part of the mind there's an aspect of consciousness and
awareness that thrives on the capacity to grasp identity now identity should be ungraspable
right it's impossible if i am kissing you know i like women so if i am kissing a woman who i love
there is a kind of knowledge there but it's it's ecstatic it it it leads beyond any possibility of
grasping it's like i am falling into an infinite um space and i am rising above all structure this kissing
thing it's unbelievable how could something like that even exist i don't know i don't understand it
but it's it's both liberating and gravitic for me and knowledge
is much more the kind that i'm concerned about is much more like porn right it's not like kissing at all
it's got the gravity but not the ecstasis right the dead structure of i know what that is see once i know
what something is the possibilities of relating with it die into that um graspable uh token right and of
all the terrible things in our human life that exemplify this money is probably the worst of them
i don't know if it's money or guns or porn maybe all three together are you know horrifyingly
uh horrifying example exemplars of the process of taking the divine the possibility space of beings and
just collapsing it into a token and then killing everything with it you know um i don't know what
are your thoughts
yeah severing the cycle results in death so when you when you transform a cycle into a ray with infinite extent
you generate something like a machine or something like a sign or a a tokenized word
yeah once you sever the cycle and and situate two opposites at odds you sort of set the stage for
extinction you set the stage for death um and this infinitude that i think you're describing yeah
it's really weird because you can create a sort of a black hole it just sucks the being out of beings
and turns that you could say it's it's the soul right you could say it it vampirically absorbs
origin entering being it vampirically enter it like gets in imagine something that interrupts the
lightning of origin coming into being right it just puts a little shunt in there and it shunts that off
into the producing structured objects and tokens think of you know i don't know whatever you like
think of um one of my favorite uh examples of this is i don't know exactly the number of packets of
ketchup that humans produce per hour but my guess would be something like 12 million
and then just imagine that you just keep producing more packets of ketchup each hour
which is what the humans generally do right they don't tend to produce less and less of something
once they start producing something they just keep making more and more and more of it
they get really excited about making more things faster which means more dead children per second in my
idea more dead minds more um sclerotic uh agonized um remains of what could have been origin alive in
being per second this is what i think of photographs as right they weren't necessarily always that they were
always super dangerous but now i think we produce around um 340 billion of them per day or something
i mean just you know but and that's just still photographs right so what you can see in that one
actually the photograph is probably the best example it's even better than money um because what you can
see is like eventually to keep those photographs those electronic photographs in existence you must
destroy living beings so people taking pictures of food eventually leads to there's no food anymore
we just have photographs it's like a stillbirth it's um abortion it is it's the wrong
thing yeah go ahead i'm sorry it contains the impulse to transcend history so it can it contains this
kind of mystical dimension but it's it's not actualized in the right way yes yes it's it's the wrong kind
of immortality exactly yeah it's the kind of immortality that is death like it's the opposite
of the possibility space of existence expressed as a token that is immortal
yes see yeah that's god path that's the wrong path oh god oh oh yeah i want it oh beautiful yeah
yes that's what it is when i look out my window right now and i see the cars
the cars those cars appear to be eternal they shine with the glow of unchangeable form
and this is the promise of machines and it's the opposite of the promise of being
yeah right it's the eternality of the structure empty of being
yeah the allure of that cleanliness that a historicity is a mystical impulse that's what i'm
saying but it's actualized in the wrong way oh my god this is this is the like this
is what we do right when we get together it's amazing i i love this um we make the the context
in which insight can can arise and then we craft it it's like it's like uncarring
we are uncarring our minds together that's what i want to do with my mind
it's crazy listening to this whole conversation while driving a car for hours on end yeah yeah
yeah driving a car to pick up my son
you you you put me in a car you said go go drive a car nate and i'll talk about how bad cars are the
whole time yeah but you are such a beautiful spirit that it's all it's all um juice for liberation
right it's all it's all liberation jews but no i'm i'm i'm seeing so beautifully together with all of you
you know and all the beings remember like in the beginning of this which not everyone was here for
we had a little invocation right where we we um i mean i i do it but i think we all agree where we
remember all of the beings who ached for um beauty and the establishment of intelligence and loving
kindness a generosity and wonder a resurrection and the erasure of prisons and cages on this world
and on all worlds and so when when you start out with an invocation like that you're gonna have to
work really hard to that up you see what i'm getting like when we agree with their spirits and their
passions and their their dreams and their suffering and what they strove for when we enter into an
agreement with that it's going to be hard to not be beautiful together
it's going to be hard to not honor the nature and the excellence of our our actual nature and our
potentials the possibility space of not merely our humanity but our beingness our organismality our
animality um are the things that we don't have words for and yet we are them we can become them
if we choose to together anytime we choose to together it just naturally occurs this it does it is very
helpful if you have someone in the uh
you know
wow this is awesome wow
it is very helpful if you have a person or two in the in the group
who um is skillful and practiced um
who's good at uh who's sort of a space person right they come from outer space or they come from the
origin world and they've got that's the stuff is still sort of with them right
that's very helpful but it happens almost instantly and automatically
if we just make this agreement together i think
i agree
because the world the universe wants this it doesn't want cars and computers and
shit it wants this the humans i don't know man something weird draws them
um when i asked toy maker about it he was basically like okay look it's a problem that
happens when you get representational cognition in an animal that is supposed to have companion
intelligences and the companion intelligences go away then that thing just starts making objects
that's basically what he said the problem was what are your thoughts
i mean that that statement right there every time we come up to this point the question is always
how do we get back to that companionship
well there's one thing i don't know like my recent essays um
um the umbilical disaster and uh
organisms are a platform for the embodiment of transphysical intelligences or whatever the
fucking ridiculous title was i'm embarrassed i should i should have a three-word title not a 19-word
title um but those explore the problem um here's the thing
thing both toy maker and the second thing that came they both basically had one thing in common
although toy maker wasn't as pushy
which was they were like look dude you become the radio station
we will gather people around you and you will re-establish the uplink
and in a non-pushy way that wasn't terrifying with toy maker i thought oh yeah that'd be good
with the second thing that happened in 2009 that was a little pushier
um and seemed very mono focused on this one thing and that scared me i was scared of that
i don't know it's very complicated i'm not sure for example okay just like it's important
for us to die into incarnation
it might be important
for our species i i don't like this idea at all but i can understand that it could be true
it might be important for our species to undergo the second death
into
bad kind of knowledge and machines
to create the possibility of a third kind of resurrection or something i don't know i don't
know um however to more directly answer the question so yeah i'm scared i'm scared i think i
could connect people to non-human intelligences and i think actually all that's that's the wrong way
of putting it you wouldn't have a mind if toy maker wasn't with you you there's no way you could
locally have a mind you're just not aware you don't have conscious interaction with that thing
and that thing if you follow your mind upstream in the direction of its origin you will
encounter there's nothing else you could possibly happen you will encounter the intelligences that
forged the possibility of your mind and that's so when you say that when you say follow your mind
upstream i don't even know how to walk i don't even know how to move upstream yeah you do in fact um
you've been doing that with us here the difference is that what we are doing
is what we are doing here is doing that in the realm of thought knowledge
and the ideas about what our humanity is that's what we are doing here but you can do that
and this is look you do know what it is because you you had problems i think and you had experiences when
you were undergoing the ordeal of um vipassana
no yeah no that's true there to me i would describe it as a shedding but i could see
a different perspective where it was also going upstream meditation is going upstream um true love
actual love which is not merely lust is going upstream um dreaming is going upstream oh so what if
what if the what if we combine these three things so i'm asking you to i'm not asking you to i'm
saying that it's possible to follow what you think of as your consciousness which you think is in
you you think it's yours that's actually a lot of the problem right there you think that this is your
thing this mind it's nathan's mind i promise you that is impossible not only is that not the case
there's no chance of that ever occurring in anywhere no chance of a separate mind no chance so you're
like the tip of one of the trees of earth you're like the top pointy point of one of the trees of earth
which are all one tree and are connected to all trees in all of time but you think no no i'm a separate
little point right that thought is the thing that keeps it's both useful and a trap if you can be
free of it it's ten times more useful or a thousand times more useful if you can't be free of it it's
mostly a trap so all i'm really asking you to do is follow this thing you call or i'm i'm not asking you
i'm suggesting that it is interesting and useful valuable and beneficial to follow what you think
of as your mind and i get what you're saying i don't know how to even take one step is i think what
you said all right so how could you take one step all right so if you wanted to take one step there's
different ways to do the one step thing one of them is obviously meditation so sit down pay very close
attention to your breathing and the sensations of your body release the structure of the prison shape
that your mind normally composes very strenuously moment to moment release that more with each breath
that will naturally result in taking steps in the direction of the origin of your mind which is not
in your body it's not on earth it's not in the universe in fact what you will discover eventually
is that it is not but what that word not means in this context no t
i mean one of the hilarious things about this knot this n-o-t is if you make an acronym of it no
is the first word other is the second word tree is the third word no other tree
that's a toy maker glimpse that's how a toy maker would show me things he would show me that inside
our languages there are these they're not fractals we need a better word i need a better word i should
have made one why didn't i make one okay it's not a fractal it's a
a fractal pro octal i don't know see the problem with the fractal is that um at every register of
the fractal the same structure is present and that looks really trippy to humans but with what nature does
with the same principle is something truly amazing and it's not like a fractal it's the difference between
the three registers of the universe your body and your hand right there's a unique instancing of the
possibility space at every register and with each unique instancing you get not near not merely unique
structure you get unique abilities affordances is the word that the the extinctionati taught me
who who introduced that was it corn fed or or was it george uh that was me yeah affordances with with nature um
at each register uh being right like the uh scope layer at each register of the fractal there are unique affordances
uh arthur young in his book the reflexive universe talks about um origin descending into matter in this
kind of v-shape where you give up certain degrees of liberty on the way down in order to gain new forms
of liberty on the way back up this is a crucially important um feature of the future
all right give me some juice boys what's going on in your minds
i think we just lost darren
we lost him did he go i think he just uh
uh he just left wow um how you doing man i'm i'm pretty good i'm uh
it long story short i'm at an inflection point in my life and uh
uh ready for what comes next
uh i don't know when you guys lost me where did where did i where did i get lost
oh you wanted to hear the juice yeah yeah give me the juice hit it hit it george hit it nathan
well the machine is like the after image of the sun so if you glance at the sun
you might see an after image that fades gradually that's knowledge that's what i meant my knowledge
yeah organization and representational cognition yes right yeah brilliant love that go so in order to
continue to incarnate the sun you need to continue to look at the sun to generate these after images
and um yeah their dissolution is totally entropic right so the machine breaks down over time the
machine needs to be maintained and serviced by this perpetual frenzy of workers right
um which i think is also anathema to the dreaming mind because yeah in the same way that the sun is
anathema to the dreaming mind the machine is anathema to what i was calling knowledge so you can
you can take knowledge in in in those two directions but
from my perspective knowledge is more like the emission of photons by the eye so i brought this
up a long time ago but if if the machinic unconscious or the machinic form of death is like the after image of
some spot of light then insight would be the reappearance of light within the living body so
the eye does this i think perhaps even in in sleep but also in meditation so what can happen in the course
of meditation is that the body as a transceiver begins to emit its own input like a microphone
i love you oh my god yeah just like a microphone that gets carried away with itself yes yes it's
feedback but it's not merely feedback go ahead yeah right so that mode of feedback is what i was
describing as a bridge so you can use it to travel between different like even images or modes of
awareness um because once you realize that the being itself is time as opposed to being in time or
moving yes yes the time dash being yeah yeah then once you know one being you can traverse yes
the totality yes that's sort of what yes that's that's a superpower right yes yes yes except we've
got it backwards the superpowers are our actual abilities and the features of our body's capacities
are the non-abilities yeah yeah yeah yeah i mean not to cast shade on the physical but um we've just
got this idea of superior is backwards it's originary not superior go ahead oh i see what you mean yeah
yeah so so the the physical body mutes or limits information so it functions like a filter but that
filter can be tempered in awareness through feedback so in the same way that a microphone might filter
certain inputs through feedback you can amplify the signal so your body can behave like an amplifier
and that's i think that's one of the okay your mind though is the same kind of thing and what we're
doing what knowledge does is it kills the feedback that would become cascades of insight
and the reason part of the reason it does that is because cascades of insight
are terrifying you don't know what to be not only do you not know what to do
when you experience cascades of insight you don't know what you are
you are deprived of the possibility of knowing what you are
right i love that laughter yeah but as we said what a being is i think is a matter of completing
or a matter of completeness so so the being doesn't already exist in some complete state
the completeness of the being is something that you supply in your relation to it so so a living being
is a is a similar kind of cascade so what takes place in the mind is really no different from what
takes place in the in the physical world when you encounter a physical being
its own cascade is tempered by your filter so there's there's something similar going on in the
external world as in the act of meditation so a tree is a form of meditation it has a mental
essence there's something edetic about it it's it's just like memory oh my god yes except that it's um
okay it's stable continuity
is deceptive
it's okay this is what it isn't it's not there it's actually not there
it's not their ness takes on the form tree
in the same way that that the not there ness of insects can take on the form praying mantis
in the same way that the not there ness
of humans takes on the form daring
it's a transcendentalization of of a kind of absence
yes yeah so you can see the link there to the machine because the god the exact opposite oh my
the god
holy
okay these are things which are forbidden for mortals to say
you're not supposed to be able to say such things
now we have we are we have like gone it's as if we we're going through the layers
of the atmosphere to reach outer space right and then you get to the layer just before
fucking hard vacuum and then you emerge through that layer into hard vacuum which of course isn't
vacuum at all
so when nathan was asking here's the really weird thing that happened nathan asked i don't know how
to take even one step in that direction and then you know from my perspective anyway
we started just walking in that direction together right now in language which is supposed to be
impossible and probably is forbidden and you know then the obvious question is well who who does the
forbidding i get it but still yeah this is insane
the forms of the organisms
okay let me see if i can say back where if i can recapitulate the transit and help me out
george the forms of the beings and the organisms the plants the insects the animals they are um
like the fingerprint
the positive fingerprint
of a kind of absence of transcendentality
transcendingness they are unique modes of
non-continuity expressed in the material reflection in the water of matter in the mirror water of
materiality as beings right temporalized structured beings and machines are the opposite of that in the
machine you have death transcendentalized as function which infinitively consumes being
and makes death in an invisible layer that we don't even see what are your thoughts exactly yeah oh my god
i'm starting to feel like i'm in hillman i don't know why i don't know why the that would happen
i want to be more bald than i already am i want to have tattoos of greek all over my body i don't know why
why why this is confusing
yeah i want to out almond almond i think that's what's going on
do you have any tattoos zero
do you have any tattoos no
nathan any tattoos
nope but i've always thought about getting one
yeah see that okay that's the difference though right like
stay pregnant you're better off staying pregnant with the idea
because see that's the thing preserve the possibility space
space rather than i i this is my suggestion anyway preserve the possibility space
um
there's something metaphysically weird about tattoos
i
i don't
i'm not trying to say anything about other people i find them fascinating on other people
they're particularly weird on women but they're also particularly weird on men
i am mistrustful of them though
well i mean can i like yeah you can i think they're they can be incredibly beautiful like in terms of
art and to actually carry art with you uh on your skin is a cool idea but the meaning that becomes
ascribed to it sort of like what we're talking about with knowledge it's literally like
in in printing that sort of uh
whatever idea you're trying to convey onto your skin to transmit that idea until you know presumably
you die or you get it removed by a laser i mean um the hope is a kind of a magical hope isn't it
and if you have a magical hope
don't settle for letters on pages don't settle for letters on pages of skin don't settle for symbols
don't settle for symbols written on the surface of the sun
go
to being
raw naked alive
and say to being
i am a child of the earth
and the stars
allow me to drink from the waters of memory that i may take my place
in the library of the hearts of the beautiful beings
don't settle for the token
sarah james
um
i heard her
say something very powerful
because we we have heard we who have read things and we who have heard humans speaking
we have heard that um
when you die there are
challenges you must face
so one of the things that she said
and sarah is a really brilliant spirit and and heart i trust her i trust her path
i trust her soul
i would let her lead me i authorize her right i totally authorize her
um it doesn't mean she's perfect it just means that i think she's good
like she has the fingerprint the scent the fragrance of origin about her and it wakes me up
and makes me come to life she was talking in an interview on third eye drops
um
and she said one of the secret things
so for for people who will listen to this and there will be people listening to this soon
i think not just us and that's one of the things that lifts us up to be able to see and and talk
and learn together much more profoundly than we might if we were having a merely private conversation
though even if we're having a private conversation
um basically what happens is that you get different lifting organs does that make sense
yeah so sarah says two things and i'll try not to paraphrase them so that they're very clear
when you die and you become extremely thirsty and you see i think she said
it's a big white birch tree and everyone is drinking there and you're very very thirsty and you see
this big white birch tree do not drink there and then when you come to a little stream you say
and you are challenged at the stream you're challenged you say i am a child of the earth and the starry heavens
permit me to drink
of the waters of memory that i may take my place among the initiatives
these are
okay in the same way that you do that you are not lucid in most of your dreams
right these two um features
they may or may not refer to an experience you could actually have
they probably do refer to an experience that many actually have but they may or may not that's not
the important thing the important thing is that you understand the principle
the principle that they encode
and carry it with you because that principle is the principle of lucidity
it's the key to lucidity sarah doesn't say this i am saying this
um if you try if you manage to do what i have recommended and tr and i would like to continue
to do what i am recommending to become what i am recommending that you traverse like the salmon
chasing the waterfall um it is impossible for the salmon to swim up the waterfall it can't be done
there are zero fish who would look at a waterfall and think i'm going to swim up that waterfall yeah
we'll get right up to the top of that thing and i'm going to swim back to where i was born
that's what we have to do in consciousness
that is the fundamental
mission i think once we become incarnate now there are there are orbital missions right just like the sun
has different planets we have different missions they're orbital missions and one of them is to
simply remind the humans of origin and to nm to nm knees them to anamnese them and to achieve anamnesis
together unforgetting together that is fundamental this is what the children are trying to get the
adults to do when they invite the adults to play but the adults are so trapped in the black iron prison
of representational cognition enculturation language that they the mothers more the mothers much more
are are are innately amenable to the child's messianic resurrective potency
the fathers also can be it's not that you know it's not like a gender problem but the fathers
are less inclined to their their mode of being is different right um and they aren't there is difficult
for the for the males to uh submit to submit right because we males we are
innately penetrative even me while i am speaking of these matters right it's very masculine the way that
i am speaking if i were speaking femininely this would be poetry and song and i would be making music
instead of admitting you see how sharp the words are they have these fricatives and um consonants
in any case
there's there's there's there's a feature of liquification that is involved in all of this
right you have to lose your structure if you want to walk toward the origin of your mind dissolve the
rigid structure of your ordinary waking consciousness if you start to do that you will immediately begin
to experience hypnagogic uh awareness right you will enter the liminal space between the worlds of life
and death between the worlds of wake and sleep between the worlds of light and dark between the worlds of
matter and origin between the worlds of knowledge and wonder
i mean for me do you want knowledge or wonder well you gotta have both but if you ask me which i prefer
i like wonder but don't give me wonder without knowledge right
give me some juice hit me come on let's have some stuff yeah
give me some juice hit me come on let's have some juice hit me come on let's have some juice
hey neid did you have anything to say
nope i am uh completely blank
congratulations you made it beautiful oh god no it's hilarious because um this word nope
all of our words for that that are words of negation do you know where i'm going here george
because if you do just take over and fly with it uh no i'm not sure oh you just said no ah that was
good bro you actually made the negation word um i like to think okay so i'm going to say a few things
that toy maker made very clear to me in the hopes that it'll help everyone here and anyone who's
listening um you don't have to look for outside beings or people or knowledge to discover
the path up the waterfall
but let me be really clear
no fish ever sat at the bottom of waterfall
and thought i am going to swim up that
fish swim up waterfalls salmon are the only ones i know that do it there may be others
um i think there's a word for this uh birth stream seeking kind of fish i saw the word in
for the first time in the book the dawn of everything
but what i'm going to try to explain to you is that your own life okay your conception your embryogenesis
your birth your childhood each phase of your life was recapitulating everything there ever was it was
recapitulating the birth of god the birth of the universe every feature of the birth and development
of human consciousness you yourself have undergone there is no other way to exist
you can't not do this and me so when people say like they say things that are confusing
and this goes back to the question of you know i don't know how to take the first step
um you your own you must
an amnes your own history
an amnes un forget your own history and you will discover in that history the answer to every
everything not the answer the nature the origin the purpose the meaning the spirit the adoration
the freedom
the transcend the transcendence you are those things it's as if you're looking out the wrong end
of uh of a seeing device right instead of oh god when george earlier was talking about um
the feedback
uh which is of course dreaming and insight is a certain kind
of this similar feedback that can happen while we're awake lucidity
right waking i want and we have here i have experienced here today um with with you all
uh lucid waking right which is this kind of an amnoetic
unforgetting
revelation
revelation so each of us undergoes that story in genesis that's something you undergo
right you are the before of adam and eve you become adam and eve
god tells you don't eat right you go through all these things in fact one of the most important
things the bible can be understood as particularly the torah the fact that the bible exists is enough
justification to take it um passionately not seriously passionately um and if you're really
curious and you and you explore the bible with curiosity you know go ahead repudiate the hell out
of it if you're you know if you're somebody like almond perhaps go ahead um see how that goes
that might turn out to be powerful i don't know but i tend to prefer the other path right i prefer the
path of um find the seeds of insight hidden within i also like the path of expose the lie
right so we got this path to find the seeds of insight hidden within coca-cola and pepsi
and then i also really like um that's just a bunch of sugar poison right i like both i like both sides
i want both wings knowledge as the death of the possibility of insight and relation and knowledge as
the unwrapping of in in awareness and consciousness of the nature of being an identity and meaning
okay where am i going here so there's a sort of personal archaeographic travel that you can do
which is what i mean in part it's it's one way of taking what i mean when i say swim up that waterfall
is your mind's origin moment to moment your mind does not exist it is not a state it is not a thing
it is not a static it's a relationship that you're having with something and if someone says well what
what is that thing i'll be like why are you talking like that no i would say um one way to call that thing
is the logos it is the being that is not i'm gonna make a double negative here it is the being that is
not not time it is the being that is not not light it is the being that is not not space it is the being
that is not not being and that being is the possibility of mind and all minds are an instance like the
organisms are at least down here of the absence a unique mode of presencing the absence of transcendence
i know i'm using negatives weirdly but this this negation thing okay so yeah now i see where i was
going i made a huge circle i didn't mean to make this big of a circle but i'll i'll go with it anyway so um
i have a sister and when we were little to hear my mom tell it
um my mom my mother who was very like with us all the time she she carefully recorded the first words
of me and my sister and i spoke before my sister because i was first born and my first words that my
mother told me which i think are really profound and masculine were i go
i go this is what i said i go this is like the sun right it's a masculine thing i go
my sister's first words were no
so you can see these two principles and when i say our lives and our our histories
are in actions of the entire history of the universe you can see that in the first words of me and my
sister right the masculine principle i go i i i do and the feminine principle of negation no men will do
every thing women know what not what should not be done oh men know some of what should not be done
but negation is very profound and when you when you hear stories about enlightenment and so on you
will almost always hear that it is rarely compared to isness it is almost always compared to not this no other
tree
give me something let's go what's left
yeah the greek concept of truth as a left way
meant something like unconcealment so yes
so truth was more like a process of
removing a veil than a predicate of something
and i think we just lost darren again
oh there we go
so
aletheia
unconcealment then you said so and then i disappeared
um so yeah the greek concept of truth was more like a process
that removed a veil than a predicate of something
yes
so you know as opposed to falsehood being the opposite of truth
what i think made truth possible for the ancient greeks was the extent to which the body behaves like a
filter so the body itself is the possibility of concealment and so then what appears in space or
what appears in the image of the external world is like a series of veils that interpenetrate
so space is a layered structure consisting of interwoven temporal
rhythms or regimes uh orchestrations yeah like a melody um orchestrations yes which is mediated by the
body so the body is like what makes concealment possible so in order to arrive at truth or a truer
image one needed to transcend the body to some extent or modulate it so basically to um interact with
its feedback um with its environment yes yes okay here's the thing it's the feedback that is the mystery
it's the feedback that produces lucid dreaming right it's the feedback that people uh chase in orgasm
it's the feedback they like in intoxication it's the feedback that becomes medicine for healing
it's the feedback
now i when i keep saying this one word i'm i'm i'm killing it i'm i'm not doing the right thing
the filter has another property it has another valence and the valence is to
the truth when it filters its own filtration
and that produces various modes of this stuff that we call feedback lucidity is a kind of feedback
um you're right though the greeks knew that the body was a problem you would never perceive the truth
because the nature of the body's filters would deceive you something like this not the greeks
some greeks who thought about these things go ahead yeah but unconcealment is also more than just
removing a veil like a blanket um in the same way that filtration is more than just you know this
unidirectional flow from the outside to the inside as it was for descartes
yes because um now you have will purpose imagination um intent right what is your intent
yeah yeah so the process of authorization that you were describing is a kind of filter
it is it's one that usually remains unconscious if we pay if we shine light on that in consciousness
very strange things start to happen that will produce various kinds of feedback go ahead
right and so the cycles in time that that we can perceive in you know the external world are like
a series of veils that issue from what the body itself is but the body is more than just what appears
in space so you know if you were to look down at your body what appears in space is already filtered
right so it's not as if this this you know this skin is like generating an image see that's that's
the mistake of modern neuroscience in in imagining that the brain or the body is somehow generating an
image that's not what happens right yeah no it's a reductive materialist eliminative materialist fantasy
yeah right it's that the body itself is already an image is already tempered by this deeper process
no it couldn't exist there'd be nothing there without the image
eidos in greek a e-i-d-o-s yes right right idolon idolon it's a mistake to privilege one image over others
and to claim that one image is the cause of others it's rather that it's rather that the the totality of
the image so multiple domains multiple beings co-arise by virtue of the same process so yes it
isn't as if matter is causing living things to exist or that matter is causing a living being to to
exhibit a certain feature it's rather that they both reflect the same underlying process so they can be
used as bridges that which causes matter causes beings
sorry what's that that which causes matter causes beings yes precisely yes so they both exhibit the
same kind of overtone uh see their structure exactly like a harmonic yeah like a harmonic right so the image
of the external world is a kind of um holistic image so so the image as a whole has certain properties or
certain features that make it look law governed or law abiding has a certain reason but the freedom from
the law resembles the freedom from the body exactly yeah so once that grants that grants insight and
understanding right understanding awareness exactly yeah insight yeah so the the physical image contains
this latent potential which can be actualized through feedback so through feedback more of the image can be
revealed that's that's what i think the greeks were talking actually more of the image arises
it's not just revealed well yeah it arises in the same sense as the completeness that we were discussing
earlier yeah yeah but okay so what you're saying is the unveiling you're placing the emphasis on the unveiling
which is different from the arising there are two competing um idol longs here one is that the nature of being is
unveiled to us so it is remembered and the other is that it is being completed by us it we are we cause
it to rise by interacting with it you follow well the completeness i think is is the same process as the
memory so the red integration the um whoa wait wait wait the reintegration yeah the reconstitution of the
being is something that you supply through knowing it or through interacting with it but it's a form of memory
memory in the same way that um in the same way that remembering a fragment of some melody um can can
re-instantiate the entire melody so if if you access one portion of the melody you can reintegrate the
totality and that's i think what takes place in encountering beings in the external world in resurrecting
them or in remembering them you complete them at the same time but their completion is also a function
of your own filter so it's not as if they exist they don't like pre they don't pre-exist you right
right yeah they're incomplete before you before you encounter them oh my god did i did you invoke me
or did i invoke you because this is absurd dude this is ridiculous you're not supposed to do this
see am i am i giving you like a forbidden fruit here is this yeah okay this is not this is not
supposed to be able to happen down here you do understand that right you do you have the same sense
of that impossibility that we are transgressing together no i don't really feel like i'm breaking
the law well i do i mean i'm not breaking the law it's like um
i've i've never participated in conversations like this one the closest
the the conversations with toymaker are transcendental to this one but this has the
stink of the same kind of progress um all right so i don't want to lose the thread by celebrating it
which is one of the weird ironies of being a human being um it's a bit like taking a photograph of
something okay so there's this idea that i know who nathan is um because i know his name and i know
i can imagine something resembling what he looks like he's this sort of toe-headed um half angelic
half awkward sort of guy young guy that i know and one of the amazing things about nathan that i
think is truly beautiful is that it's very clear that he doesn't merely know what to do he's discovering
what to do as he plays in the possibility space of his of his moment and his relationships with others
and being a human and being nathan and all these things and that's really amazing but there's a conflict
in him between the static uh nathan-esque known nathan and there's a conflict between that and the
representational layer of human existence modernity culture technology systems structure roads cars
rent paying job thing right and there's a conflict between that and his interiority
um we all inherit that conflict you know within the bible and they're like the sins of your fathers
will be visited under the so that what the actual sin is is just representational cognition let's be
clear right they wasn't like they did a really bad thing or they like decided that we're going to go into
matter and become material beings that wasn't the sin sin was like we will play with tokens instead of
being together with each other we will tokenize relationships um and thoughts and things but that
that sin is also important it's it's sort of like the first angel you can't get over you got to have that
um so one of the things i was i was what's so amazing to me is that we resurrect each other when we engage
in behaviors like those with wit in which we are engaged right now we bring each other into the possibility
space of consciousness awareness thought understanding insight intelligence wonder awe
anamnesis we bring each other into the space i need you to carry me in return i will carry you
and we will unforget together and we will
we produce a kind of a feedback effect with our minds right i give you some juice it explodes in you
you give me the result of that explosion it explodes in me and we keep going that's how you get back up
the waterfall what are your thoughts
i mean that completely um obviates the concept of an existing static darren exactly existing static
george right we bring each other into existence or we bring each other into structured death
right yeah so you inform an aspect of my own identity which is very real but that aspect of
my identity is your reconstruction so memory is more than just retrieving something that once existed
memory is a creative act so you create you co-create an aspect of my own identity when you interact
oh yeah right manema sign is the goddess i will adore manema signs right she who is memory without her nothing
yes yes this relates back to what nate was saying earlier for someone i think it was nate
um yeah my identity isn't actually mine it's not mine to protect right right no the this is the
thing right if i want to be the fingernail of darren then i'll just darrenize and i'll be like you know
darren's the greatest thing ever you should really love he's amazing bro darren is the good shit right and
on and on and on and on the more that i do that the more that i'm dead inside it's not that ego is bad
you need to have fingernails right i don't want my fingernails to go away but i also don't want to be
like the fingernail on the end of my pinky that's too um limited a scope for my being and also that if i
become that flat and hardened and angular um almost all of my capacities for new degrees new new ways of
um new degrees of liberty right new ways of being a being will disappear they will disappear into
into structure right um repetition uh it's a symphonic situation it's without the body you can't
synchronize the multiplicity of principles but the fact of the body can trap you in the appearance
of repetition and trap you in the sense of repetitive um consistencies what do you think
yeah i think the same process also occurs in the natural world if you look at the evolution of life
as a whole so the individual the seemingly individual human being
in its identity or in its ego is like a condensed version of what took place on earth yes it's the um
when when you hear this in like uh the emerald tablet right as above so below as within so without
what you're what's actually being said is weirder than that what they're saying is there are no forms
that are not the unforgetting of origin in structure
yeah because darwinism posits that an individual being is the object of selection or a certain feeling
there's no chance of that being true yeah yeah though you can slice the manifold in such a way that that
becomes the most obvious feature of biological reality you can slice the manifold that way that's
a way of cutting yes yes yes go ahead yeah the identity of the organism is also co-created by its
environment in the same way that you co-create my my identity it's the exact same process yes yes
see this is why you can do these things alone because all of the beings are in you but when we
come together in the way that we do here um like both things work you can anamnese in isolation you can
joyfully anamnese in isolation that's possible it's probably more challenging it seems much more fun and
interesting to do it with brilliant inspired you know playful other beings um the tree is such a being
any tree is such a being but but here
it's really funny we are i think we are doing what the greeks would be very proud of
socrates i think would be like crying with joy in his grave to hear a conversation like this um this is so rare
that the humans get to do this that they do it in any way that sustains itself
it's very precious this kind of this kind of medicine that we can become together right
and i think uh it's different you know like when nate says i don't know how to take the first step okay
uh yet there's a difference between
um giving humans instructions
and becoming the way together with and for each other
right i mean it resembles the salmon at the bottom of the waterfall yes
asking itself i don't know how to take the first leap right yes also something that most people will
not really understand that the salmon naturally understand it's very profound um
is that we think of individual salmon swimming up a waterfall
but i'm pretty sure that what happens is that many of the salmon
some of those salmon that reach the base of the waterfall they come from the same mother
right those mothers don't have one or two children
they have 700 children follow yes so when they when they're collecting back at the base of the waterfall
what's happening is like the the minimo signing the memory of the mother is materializing
at the base of the of the waterfall and the spirit of the father who goes i go
right he is materializing in the between of them and they draft together
right multiple children of multiple mothers materializing at the base of the waterfall
they come from the same stream they come from the same year of the same time stream they come to the
base of this waterfall it's not just the waterfall that is the problem there are grizzly bears
others up there at the top that want salmon brains they want to eat some salmon brain they mostly throw
the fish away from what i understand they don't eat the salmon they want the brain just chew this
chop the brain taste that brain and throw the fish away and grab another one
so there's lots of um weird challenges to get back to the birthplace the origin place um
what a shockingly brilliant metaphor and nature like if you see if you see a situation like this in
nature it has 10 000 meanings not one we're using we are making expedient
use of one of the meanings of this figure that we see in the salmon swimming up the waterfall which
i love i think is amazing um i love the salmon i love the living beings the living beings are
the embodied transcendental spirit of origin alive with eyes and
and they are delicate right they can suffer if you're not embodied it's pretty hard to suffer i think
although we have you know models of disembodied suffering in hell and so forth right i don't know
i don't know about that i suppose it's i mean
okay let's just say then that the forms of suffering
very uh charged right to be embodied it's a different kind of suffering if you
are injured or sick or lost or alone or deprived or you know you can't something bad is happening to
your body it's very it's uh tangible it's very tangible
i love the living beings absolutely without any like um unconditional adoration of living beings
unconditional adoration they are heroic and they are doing i know this is going to sound weird but i'm
i'm basically certain that even uh when they are confused like our kind of beings are which i think
is a really weird problem why are the humans so stupid um
they are doing something that that is invisible that is uh beautiful and nourishes the origin world
it enriches the origin world but there is a very bad there seems to be a very bad problem with with our
kind of our kind of being with human beings and
damn i'm losing a thread that i'm trying to find here
problem
um
humans
or ignorance
i don't know it's very weird i can't find the thread it disappeared as i was trying to grasp it
typical
yeah maybe it needs more time to incubate
no i had it it's a hippocampus thing my hippocampus
powered down briefly the thread i was chasing dissolved
um
wow
what an amazing path we've woven here
perhaps it is a good time
time for us to wind up
how are you feeling george
yeah i think we're over four hours now just about
okay
yeah i i can't even express my gratitude for this um
this is just
i mean it's like the nectar of being alive
dripping into a graveyard of my ordinary life
wow i'm glad to hear that
i hope i hope it's somewhat you know i hope that resonates with you as well
yeah yeah
it's my lifeline
right on
yeah i'm just so grateful
um not just for those who were here today and you and nate
uh but those who gave birth to this you know i can't imagine
what hugh would make of this conversation
i have no idea
uh
right
i i i think he would i don't know like this is the opposite though of doom
singing and that's what i really love
i don't doom singing doesn't help the humans
right it doesn't help anyone it's not clear at all
like the bad bad bad bad thing it's part it's a it's an ingredient in the soup that we
make and eat together here
but that thing that's just um it's really toxic if that's the the main ingredient right
well the point of doomerism is to get you to die early so that you can resurrect early that's
the idea die early yeah yeah die now
hope right that's yeah give it up right and then you repeat it
i see it's a sort of black sabbath thing
it's like salt soup
right yes just suck all the moisture out of me right now desiccate
if you give up then maybe you have a chance i mean i think that's the idea
then you'll i know i like our flavor much better
it's inspired and inspiring and am noetic and it sings the praises of many beings who
have striven for beauty and
um
um not it's it's more ripe it's it's more mature it's more yeah yeah it's fruity it's fruity and
fragrant juicy and nectarous
and i'm so grateful for all the beings who gave us this chance to exist now who suffered and strove
sometimes fought, sometimes died, who spoke and who were silent, who sang and
who cried, all of the many beings, I adore them. I remember them. I love them.
They are my family. You are my family.
So grateful.
We are grateful for you!
If you don't know, I am thankful for you!
How will I support you?
I am thankful to you.
And here we go!
