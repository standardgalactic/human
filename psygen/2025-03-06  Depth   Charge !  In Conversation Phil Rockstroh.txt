yeah so so i've lived in san francisco for about 40 years and yes i've absolutely seen the uh
the gentrification in fact i could probably be seen as one of the early waves of gentrification
because when i came here i was a an apple technical consultant primarily in publishing
design and architecture so um i was making enormous sums of money in the 90s like ridiculous
amounts of money and at the time i was publishing an art and literary journal called cyanosis so
almost all of my friends were artists writers actors musicians um and they definitely saw me
you know they they knew what i was doing for a living so so they saw me even back then as you
know kind of the first wave of tech in influx in a way well i remember in the 90s salon magazine
started there and there was you know it was actually kind of a bohemian wave of online
things happening which was not objectable you know objectionable at all um you know there was i mean
san francisco was once again a hub of something happening of alternative culture but then the
evolution of that is always you know first the artists move in and of course this is the story
of gentrification you know in the 90s i had a conversation um andre kagescu wrote a blurb for
a book i collaborated on in a dinner and um in new orleans you know he made the comment that the art
movements have a commonality um of how they exist and at the time seattle was going on so you know
from seattle to paris um cheap rent and and then without cheap rent then you can't have a bohemian
alternative to the dominant culture um you know because i mean and i've seen that happen in austin
which is the sister city of san francisco as you probably know that the cross-pollination of music
was extraordinary exquisite and then you know now austin is being invaded by the same tech bros
and the rents are going sky high so so that that that is gone now too um yeah nearly zero of my
original cohort still lives here the last time i had any significant interaction with a bohemian or
artistic cohort is probably more than 25 years ago right there's just there's nothing now i'm not
saying there's none of it here you know i'm much older now i don't really have access to it in a
variety of ways but um but yeah the the the weird thing one of the weird features of colonization
colonization is that it recolonizes itself right it's like a recursive process and it's always
you know if we're if we're looking through this lens right then we see uh consistently sort of new
mutations and the colonization goes from sort of external to internal in the way that perhaps social
media represents yeah yeah and then internal colonization is the thing i've written about
is you you know i mean there you have to adapt to necessity you know in in the greek goddess
necessity use the root word of angst and anxiety um archetypal psychologist traced her name james hillman
traced her name to um what you put around an oxen to control it the choke on a slave or an ox
and she has no temples that you can bring offerings to because you have to get up you have to find
something to eat you have to relieve your paddle and ladder and bowels you have to find a roof over
your head there are things you have to do for necessity so there's no reason to give an offering
your offering is just going through daily life and when necessity um gets harder and harder and harder we
have anxiety and then you can say and then one of the ways we with anxiety we react to it
is we become manic and if you i don't know if this i watched this happen in new york which has
always been hermetic in this way hermetic in the good sense of this cross-pollination this alchemy of
art and music and creativity but then hermes got to his trickster side as far as becoming a fleece artist
becoming a grifter you know in ancient greece and athens they were put right outside of the outskirts
of the polis and there were giant enormous statues of penises you know that warned the public you know
there was a type of male era so there was that symbolism but there was also you know dickheads
are over here and they're going to take your money that's how they dealt with their tech you know their
tech bros um so i watched in new york which always had a balance between immigrants
coming in and immigrants exiles from the rest of america too that had something to say could find
cheap rents find an affinity with other people there was a time you could walk down the street
in the east village and just get into the most extraordinary conversations on stoops
you know you would just meet somebody who was never going to be famous but they should have been
you know bands that were as good as any band that ever made it playing out every night
and so you know and there's there's an effect that has on an individual too to to challenge yourself
to take to take your art a little bit further and then there's the which i've seen something you write
about there's the effect on the soul because obviously something happened to you there must have
been something with jeffrey kripal um at the university at um at rice university he writes his archives of the
impossible cause cause the flip yeah there must have been a flip that happened in in in your psyche
that caused you to go from um the life you were living to what what um i'm looking for the word for
but what fills your heart now yeah there certainly was um
and you know before i it's funny i'm getting i'm getting kind of choked up just listening to you
um i'm not sure that's funny but it's it's important um
you know san francisco was my first taste of a real bohemian culture although i had gotten sort of
previous uh samples from aspects of the culture in santa rosa where i was living just prior to
here there were a few little pockets of artists and musicians actors and writers and so forth
and um you know i remember uh in the 90s the the two of the children of ted berrigan and alice
notley came here uh anselm berrigan and and ed berrigan and they were quite young at the time i
think ed was probably 17 18 and anselm was maybe like 22. and they were they were part of the the
sort of the little uh cohort we had here for a while and i remember hearing noises such as you know
well san francisco is sort of like training wheels for for actual artistic life you really if if you're
gonna if you're gonna make it if you're gonna do this you gotta go to new york right which is of
course where where they were from um and they're both absolutely brilliant uh i i remember their
their presence here and meeting their mother and going to some readings of hers and and hearing you
know recordings of ted and stuff back in the 90s that were profoundly influential on me um and you know
there were there were waves of tech colonization and i was certainly part of the early wave set
uh but i watched for example like kate ashbury just become completely gentrified you know it was a
it was a fairly significant cultural um what womb you know if you will uh and
you know when i was younger in my my late teens when i started messing around with computers i was
primarily interested in three things writing um strangely artificial intelligence and music
right so i i was fascinated by the capacities of computers to become an interface to electronic
instruments and so forth and i thought you know i was reading out uh alan kurzweil and stuff back then
and perhaps some good lesher bach by hofstadter and and um i remember i was only really fascinated with a
i was fascinated with ai because i wanted an experience this actually leads into where you were going a
moment ago i wanted an experience of relating with something that i could fully trust was actually
intelligent and it seemed that very few of the humans and certainly not our cultures resembled
this virtue of of insightful living intelligence and i thought that perhaps it would be possible to
compose such an intelligence mechanically i thought that for about eight months
and then i realized that what cells were doing you know just the basic what they this is a dumb phrase
the building blocks which is insane of of organisms was so much more profound than anything machines would
ever possibly approach that that that never my branch of in you know that branch of interest didn't
die out but my idea that oh we're going to make something intelligent inside a machine
definitely you know mostly faded away this was the 90s when time people thought that they were going
to make money by delivery coffee at home right there was a there was a lot of grandiosity i remember
standing in a bookstore in atlanta georgia and looking over to wire magazine and it was talking about
the economy is never going to crash again it's going to go up and up and up and up and i'm thinking
these people are drinking way too much espresso you know they're staying up all night they're not
getting any sleep this is a kind of um what they call in union psychology player grandiosity the winged
youth that flies up until his wax and wings are undone by the sun yeah yeah the icarus syndrome
syndrome which is you know which which infects capitalism you know there's this there's the aspect
of um what they call in union psychology even the cynics the old man of order limits time money
uh agriculture you know he plants the seeds his eros is over as far as sexuality but he plants seeds in
the ground and they grow that way and that can include money but the flip side you know young
said it's a split off archetype one side is the old man of order limits of time the other is the youth
which is necessary too of having no limits and it seems to me that you know um this is a poor culture in
a way that we don't have a tomorrow you know we have a few charity but we don't actually plan for
the player thinks he's so special and unique the future is going to unfold and take care of itself
you can see this with elon musk you can see he wants to break the bonds of the earth he wants to
he wants to fly off to mars and become its sperminator you know rather than being here on earth and
you know having some way that we actually work like you said the cell the cell of the is the earth
this complex degree of cells that are interrelated like our body is interrelated and we don't seem to
be able to get to that place where we realize that there is an interconnection not only the earth but with
all things where inspiration comes from you know the greeks believed there was a daemon and you know if you
couldn't look at a god directly like dionysus's mom he turned to a pile of ash so every every person
had a daemon that connected him with larger orders and we don't actually have a we don't have a way to
find ourselves in that because of you know this hyper individuality um that brings on a kind of crack
pot crack what i call crackpot realism you know there is an idea that okay show me how we can make the
future right now by making lots of money and you know of course in america where you can come and
reinvent your own identity right you in britain you were who your family was here you could just make
it up as you go along and that's good that's that's what an artist does they create a unique identity but
the other side of that is the grifting aspect of that culture where you can just make it up as you
go along becomes very tempting and yeah i i recently quipped that it that it's become a what can't you
stop me from doing accuracy which is actually interesting there was a lot of you know you were
talking about the 60s there were a lot of yippies that were doing that but they were living artistically
you know there was an idea of where we're going to take out they probably grew up on mad magazine as you
know and they said we're going to live by it we're going to live by mad magazine and later you know
national lampoon and we're going to go out and we're going to live life as art um and then of course
if you do it successfully you get commodified and that modification becomes an addiction because you
you know i must be doing something right and so when you get money you're you're you're very unstoppable
the more money you get there seems to be less and less consequences for you the more you go along
so so you lose that connection of how things are done down here among us shabby people it's funny you
know um so i'm i'm there's like i have a million questions uh and i i have no idea we can just have
a conversation ask each other questions whatever is comfortable right but um you know i'm i'm not
formally i'm a non-formally educated person so i've never even been to high school um and when i was
a kid my my primary teachers were science fiction authors i've read thousands of science fiction stories
and those were the mothers and fathers of my mind primarily um but i remember literally at 16 i was
something of a master book thief right i was a runaway i was living on the street and i basically
just decided that you know since society wasn't wasn't giving me anything really at all then books
were free for me and i remember literally you know shoplifting abby hopman's steal this book right
so yeah you know i was something of a child of the 60s i mean i was born in 63 and uh
you probably saw more deeply into it than i did um but even you know when i ran away i went to a place
called the russian river and this was probably circa 84 i'd guess no it was probably even pre-80
or early 80s 81 82 and what was going on there was there was sort of a leftover bubble of 60s culture
so it was really like a time machine back then my mother was um managing this big victorian hotel called
the highland dell and it was just like the 1960s every day they had a huge bar big dance floor
bands playing a kitchen and all this stuff and it was just hippies rednecks i mean the primary
cohorts were hippies rednecks and gay people right which don't necessarily get along all that well the
hippies and the gay people which was just more brittle form of bohemian but still kind of hippie
yeah yeah you know the hippies weren't quite as angry that you know the punks were more like yippies
except um with a lot more of you know what they call the time attitude i remember being in punk
clubs and i remember there was a shift from like let's say the cute hippie girl that would come up
you know reeking of patchouli and be open to talking about you know her horoscope to girls that would
slam into you and i asked my friend i said why do they keep they said well they must think you're cute
or something because so there was a different form of communication but there was still a viable bohemian
because they were squatting in the post-industrial ruins of america right you know in various places
and they were living for something resembling art even if they weren't artistic people were trying
to live artistically and see my way into the 60s was i do remember i got most of it from television
right and they got everything wrong but when i got to be 13 or 14 in atlanta um there was an underground
newspaper called the great speckled bird it was the equivalent of the berkeley barb or the detroit free
press and you know i went and hung out and i could sell the papers on the street and uh dealt you know
dealt with that street life there that was going on but this is interesting because you were talking
about one of the way colonization happens there there is this form of it um the mayor of atlanta
at the time um he was a jewish man but he was really overdoing the southern thing and he come
and go hi i'm saying myself you know and there had been jewish people in atlanta since you know
since the early colonists here but he sent into a six block area he spent sent 200 cops and these
policemen's job was to destroy hippiedom to arrest anybody selling wheat and i didn't know at the time
but later in the church commission and when contel pro came out it was full of fbi agents they were
full of cia operatives and they were bringing in bikers and they were bringing in people dealing
speed and heroin to destroy the neighborhood as they were busting the people for acid and grass
and you know busting the hippie communes so there was that form of contel pro colonization happened
and now just like now if you go to midtown atlanta which was called the strip in those days
because it was full of victorian houses across from piedmont park which would be the atlanta
equivalent of of the districts in san francisco and new york where these hippie communes and hippie
crash pads were you go there it's hyper gentrified unrecognizable as most of atlanta was but still in
the 80s atlanta there was a viable bohemian culture um you know which produced um bands like rem even though
they were up the road in athens and the black crows and the georgia satellites you know at any given
time there were really good bands some good enough to be famous unlike those that were happening the
same time as what was happening as i was you know doing i was and then i started doing like spoken word
and music tours around you know 48 states every six months with a collaborator and then we go through
new york and go through san francisco and austin and boston and you know those areas but you i could
see that happening austin still had a vestige of of that san francisco music vibe um atlanta did small
places like charlotte did um ashville other places all around still had it but since i lived in germany and
have come back to the states recently for a while i've noticed that's almost completely gone because
of the high rents and you know that's what i said we have this mania of hermes which in his positive
side he is the crossroads i could go into the many synchronicity experiences which is hermes domain
that made me who i am by community by going out these crossroads experience where the mentor
or what you needed at that moment just showed up i'm not sure what the alchemy is that creates that
but it is there in existence and that there seems to be a way with high rents that's less likely to
happen or maybe it happens with people who make for much more money than i do and it's happening there
in this aspect of the hermetic yeah it's brilliant um this correspondence between the upswing
and the difficulty of just uh covering one's survival expenses and so on and the loss of creative
artistic bohemian insightful um traditions is quite profound right there's a that's not an imaginary link
that that's a concrete problem it is a it is concrete but it's also shamanistic
say more about that the shaman really just doesn't give a fuck right he you know he went mad in his
youth and they said we can't do anything with this kid and they gave him to the shaman and you know he
walked between worlds because this one was you know like the old gospel song this world is not my home
just passing through and so he learned to pass through and then and there is that kind of
connection at the crossroads that would happen when people happen into a thriving bohemian culture
and part of that is the ability as you have to be allowed to fail over and over again to feel free
enough i mean i imagine that there are personalities that can keep failing and keep going but most time
you know i remember hearing the antidote that bob dylan promised his parents if he hadn't made it
cross for med headway in a year he'd come home to minnesota and work in the family hardware business
and i think you know and so in those days you you could come and be accepted and there was a way
that you could be nurtured by mentors who also had cheap rent or places they could have you crash and
now when i lived in new york before my wife and i left and um lived in munich we you know everybody
in our building was young going to nyu going to parsons but every one of them was a trust affair every one
of them's parents were taking care of the enormous high rents and you know there is a certain self
absorption that comes with that that i noticed that there was an inability to whatever that was that
you know from the desert comes jackson polish pollock and he can piss on you know his patron peggy
gumenheim's fireplace right and he still he still can do that otherwise he's very nice they were all
very nice you know but they you know they they weren't going to create splatter art and change art
history because everything was too comfortable for him there was not that interplay between having to to
live and be reborn into this world they were they could still live in their very nice bushy world at
the same time they're they're what you know they're they're almost has to be a way where you keep your
identity and you write about that you know you still keep that and there is the daemon in there
but there is a way that you say okay i'm leaving that and i'm open to rebirth and it's almost it's a
process of soul making and um i think when in our culture um when you have the spirit of money and
it is a spirit you know in and soul making cam cam by way i'm not you know i'm not saying that money
is the root of all evil it is going to exist there's going to be an exchange of somehow there's going to
be this exchange of money but the way we regard it um seems in this culture where it is the only
option towards freedom you know there there is the freedom that you can have that comes from being
totally freed by your art as you find a way like okay for example one way i could be a poet is i learned
to read tarot cards uh on sixth street in um in austin texas we were busking on the streets trying
out new material and making a dollar or two to get a pizza slice of pizza and there was and this um
transvestite tarot reader said i have to go pee can you watch my cards and you know reading
union psychology as i had people came up and i just started playing with the cards and people
were handing me money and that made more than that night than busking by doing that so you know i i
as i said i studied that art and i could always go into a cafe and lay down some cards and then
make money doing that and not have to worry about my security and hence be free to be able to write
and not you know i have three close friends and we were all told in high school um i'm going to
advertising you know and i tried it for a while but i would find myself weeping you know across the
side of the buildings after those three martini lunch lunches you know there would be just something
was askew about and later you know after much analysis it was like i'm taking the archetypes that
come from eternity and applying them to hemorrhoid cures you know it's like somehow i i found my way to
the asshole of creation and that's what this is about right so there was a there was a spiritual
crisis and i i was going to ask you about that because you must have had something similar come
about in your life as i mentioned you know jeffrey kripal's flip that comes about and then somewhere
emanations from somewhere else arrived that that work as guides yeah so much there so
you know i began writing poetry when i was 18 and it it actually began with a very specific event which
was me and my sidekick in stockton at my apartment my friend rich verone and one of his friends who i
hadn't met dropped acid in santa rosa had no idea how to get to my house and just drove directly to my house
you know on lsd and i noticed when they got there we had you know they gave us some some lsd and we
we had quite an adventure that night but i noticed that they both had notebooks and i you know i was a
voracious reader my whole young life and i looked in their notebooks and there was there was some
journalistic stuff and some creative stuff and whatever and that's the night when i first wrote
something in a notebook and then i just kept doing that and i wrote hundreds of absolutely abysmally bad
you know um sort of uh narrate like looking at myself in a really bad mirror and just hundreds
of bad poems and eventually one day you know that that flipped around um and i and i finally began to
to be capable of writing something resembling an actual poem and i i remember what that day was but
that process graduated into a much more experimental relationship with language and i was hyperlexic as
a kid um yeah there's some apocryphal stories about that that i'll skip so uh i met this guy gary he
introduced me to some crazy people i'd heard lori anderson and there's this album with her and john
giorno and i i heard this craziness coming out of john giorno that my friend was very interested in
and i was reading burroughs and stuff and we began to experiment with language i became interested in
psycholinguistics um and as part of that experiment i took a job writing ad copy right on the same same
thing like going to advertising right um there's that film like how to get ahead in advertising
guy i think actually grows a second head or something in any case the pimple that becomes the
head exactly yeah and i you know i i saw that experience as um one which i've done many times
in my life of going to the enemy terrain to understand how that shit works right how people
can be influenced with language but it led to some very wild experiments with language and i quickly had
direct experiences where things that burroughs speaks of and i'm not a huge fan of burroughs's uh sort of
characteristic way of being a writer he's he's kind of an alien um on earth right uh but i learned so
much from him he's certainly one of my finest mentors especially when he describes exp producing
experimental situations in which to understand something you know see something new about
the universe or whatever and so yeah i began to have experiences where things i wrote about i wouldn't
i wouldn't say there was mere synchronicity it was as if some of the things i was writing about
occasionally generated futures and that made me very suspicious in a fundamental way about what the
is going on around here because if you can do science fiction days you've read philip k dick too
and yeah that was an influence because that's what immediately popped to mind burroughs by way of philip
k dick okay okay you're on the right track yeah so um you know i'm happy to talk about this a little
further but to be very uh simplistic about it i had these two experiences so i had a couple experiences
where things i wrote almost literally came true um complex things where there's like five or six elements
in the narrative and these things come true like with the right name in the right location and stuff
not a whole bunch of those experiences but enough to let me know like something weird's going on here
and i looked into the some of the history of the surrealists who were also my mentors particularly
the women people like remedio svaro and leonora carrington and um dorothea tanning and so forth uh in any case
i had this adventure that began around 2000 and the first time i was just gripped by this incredible
inspiration that i've never seen anything like and i sat down and i wrote 150 pages of text in about
two hours which i'd never done anything like that in my life right and i saved the document and i upgraded
my operating system during the upgrade it crashed i got the thing back together i'm a mac tech right
this is my game the document's gone everything else is fine that document is gone and i can't
recreate it the thing the inspiration that gripped me disappeared and in the document i was exploring
the foundations of the problem sort of with humans and language and conceptual thought and i thought i
felt that i had finally a window on it i could i could see its origins i could see what we could do
about it i could see like a whole way of fixing this problem so that was obliterated and then in 2002
in may the same kind of inspiration gripped me and i began writing a document called symbols insanity that
was relatively similar to the first one and somehow during that process early on in it maybe about 45
minutes in um there were there was sort of three things that happened in the sequence and i'll i'll
stop very shortly here so the first was i began to conceive of human minds as a world
a world a world just like ours but that we can't see so an environment right and i called that
environment the cognizant and then it was immediately apparent to me that there were organism
like features in that environment that inhabited it and i called these thrisps
they're very domineering they're much more darwinian than organ organisms are they basically just
go for domination of the transports terrain reproductive rights mutation ability and so
forth and these could be you know thought of as memes in a way but what i was seeing was more like a
complex animal uh entity and then when i went into my imagination to invent a word for the connections
in the network i call the network the cognizant and when i went to invent a word for that
that something happened that was absolutely world changing for me which was there was a light in my
mind in a place that i've never knew existed and the moment i became aware of that light it began to
teach me impossible things that relationship went on for nine months and it was like being
it was like having the the soul of the logos itself with me at all times teaching me all day long so
that was the transformational the fundamental transformational experience that completely
you know death and rebirth rewrote my awareness of what everything is obliterated my existing human
ontology replaced it with stuff that's not from humans yeah well i mean chock-fil-a we call it high
strangeness or you know diane silka who writes about those experiences and connects them with ufos or
jeffrey kripal it's pretty it's classic i mean it started i think with the poetry and maybe the lsd that
you know and of course that's an experience where you're when you're young like that you write bad poetry
until the figure goes this is so awful i'm going to come to hell you know some muse some entity some
daemon something comes to be an assistant to this kid that's really trying hard and there's you know
i kind of look at the figures and like you said you know ram das said just because you're intel you're
in touch with a disembodied being it doesn't mean it's intelligent so you kind of have to be careful
about who you leave it in the house like some of them you said are very domineering you know it reminded
me what what flashed my mind as you were doing that is some of those entities that come about
when people describe in dnt trips like you're looking down into the dna of how the psyche personal
and collective looks and we're trying to find an interpretation for something that can't be
interpreted you know i wrote a very short poem i don't know if you read it i put it on on facebook
and i haven't sent anywhere else but just you know a tick sensibility about how you know it there are certain
ways that there's certain chemical reactions that tick smells on skin or fur that makes it just it
doesn't even know it's in these brambles it doesn't even know it's on a twig but it just sort of it just
sort of finds its way you know you could call it the the pollen path with a b you you could just sort
of call it a way of destiny with human onto the blood this is where it needs to go but you know it has
no awareness of what sky is and you know we live in a brambles the same way we don't really know
you know to use huxley's notion we filter down what you know actually by way of william james we
we winnow down so much so we can live day to day we're not all of a sudden getting this
this florid dmt imagery coming in you know we just so we can put one foot in front of the other during
the day and make our way through those experiences like you're talking about happen in a way when we
can handle them or we'll go mad and it lets them just lets enough in because you know we'd be like
that tick that all of a sudden that would have no reference to the sky wouldn't even know what we're
looking at so we're always walking through this architecture of heaven almost to put it that way you
you know it is always here but we are seeing it in a particular way that describes our humans
you know a fly can be coming through a room where mozart is playing it means nothing to it there's a
pile of poop over there that's meaningful you know so all the time we are kind of standing on music
you know there there is this this you know to me you know sometimes it feel sometimes it feels like
you know a major chord sometimes it feels like a minor chord at best they're putting them together
in a way that that we are coming in existence and we're seeing we're having what what kerouac called
you know called the downbeat we're being beaten down till we rise as a beat and we're beatified
and so you know what you're describing is a to me i'm hearing a beatification that's why i mentioned
diane posolka you know there is an aspect of where you all of a sudden your life was going to
completely take a different course because essentially you're a different person after that
you you do you still have a vestige i mean i am still the person that i had i was before these
experiences why i just call put them in a more mundane sense even though to call it poetic is not
mundane they were a place where you i was improved with a poetic vision of seeing things it made life more
resonant it made it made a way of living every day tolerable because i you know it made the mundane
have a language where it spoke to me and it it spoke of things both deeper and larger than me
that i could only get in an evocative sense but it was reassuring to know that was happening
so there's a there's a lot to talk about here and i'm not sure exactly which star to uh focus the
the macroscope on but how about your load star fair enough you know um i think you and i are both
uniquely and perhaps differently aware that most of what we are isn't human that our humanity is not
human yeah i mean even if we were to be very simplistic and non-metaphysical about it first we
are beings then we are beings in this solar system then we are organisms then we are animals then we are
humans then we are particular sorts of humans maybe right so even if we just take that consent those
concentric circles it should be clear that most of us isn't human we are beings right we are you know
beings from this part of the the universe we are you know as i said so i think that um i remember
theodore sturgeon's book more than human and certainly i'd read valis you know by dick fast active living
intelligence system um whatever it was that happened to me and i don't i'm not it's not important to me
to ontologically you know label oh it was a this i i don't think we'd have the words for it no we
we certainly would you refer to might have a language that we do understand yeah essentially
one of the things they so it was like being in school all day basically it was it was an educational
thing and it was kind of like being in a a school for like a preschool for angels or something like
this is one way i could describe it but um it introduced me directly to the non-human aspects of
being human and i've never recovered also similarly to something you said it warned thankfully i've
never recovered but it warned me that um something similar to it could could arise in my future
experience and that i should be extremely careful if that happened and you know have some do some
discernment and make some checks because essentially it implied that just like humans right um the fact
that actually it used a trope it was like your friend joe comes to the door every day you know
him you know his face you know his voice one day he knocks on your door you look outside it's joe
you open the door how do you know it's joe right you think you know it's joe but what if this day
it's not joe how would you know right so it gave me it basically trained me in all kinds of things
but what i'm trying to get at is you know we do have stories from the ancients and i strongly suspect
that human beings were for most of our history we had companion intelligences we might have even
those might have been necessary to our humanity i think they still are and that's one reason we're in
such a wasteland we agree yeah now i'm not trying to you know propose a religion or whatever but i i
think it's it's very clear to me from what i was shown what i've experienced directly that we are like
bees on a world without flowers or rather the reverse we are like flowers but there are no bees
and we were born we were made for interaction with these kinds of intelligences that are
not necessarily material there's probably a broad array of them you know i've heard john vervake
talk about encountering hermes recently wildly different from what happened to me because the
thing that was with me never spoke in language it just reforged my awareness directly as if it had
composed my mind right well i mean that's the that's the real key and angel you know each angel is
terrifying because it serenely disdains to annihilate you you know so there you know that that's the
annihilation period but i mean like what you're saying is yeah there was a lexicon for this i mean i've
heard people um james hillman talk on the subject when a greek walked through the polis
in classical greece there was athena with them if they look seaward you know they they saw a particular
terrifying god with a triton right there was you know that there there were you know there was a
vote between in in athens about who was going to be um the patron whether it was going to be athena or
the aforementioned scary sea and one vote put athena there but see if you walk through there you would
you would actually be with the goddess of the polis and and would would inform you of how to be in this
space not that this was utopia you know we went through all the anguish and joy that we do as
human beings it's what i just mentioned before i think there would be a greater resonance to it
and so these archetypal forms that we're talking about some have a language some don't and this is
you know this is the structure of an unseen world like i quoted in a piece i put up put out this morning
um you know i often saying we're lived by powers we only pretend to understand
and you know so these powers that live through us um you know they speak to us i remember when i you
know sometimes when i would be writing a short story with different characters or a play um i'd be in the
grocery store and sometimes my hands would be reaching for food and i'm going why is that in my
cart i don't eat that oh she does that's what you know the character that you're creating that is the
food that you know so there is a word so that gives you emanations that there is um some binding
intelligence and you know you just look at bell's theorem and that are later aspects proof um even
location is not what we think it is in quantum physics they pretty much said that location is an illusion
you know it's relative like time yeah so in these spaces beyond you know these spaces um
that we in the human space i think it's important to live a human life a lot of people that get this
message you know like you would mention burris some kind of alien insectoid intelligence you know
which i think was um you know really captured by david cronenberg
and in the movie he did with these alien insect intelligence that took him over that he was
it spent his early life trying to kill you know being you know um but there was an aspect of that
of where how am i going to receive this and still remain human and i think that's what that's the
poetry is the bridge you know how am i going to bring this like because i mentioned rilke
where he talks about in his early poem the man watching where he's you know where he's talking
about the poem starts with an image of a great storm blowing in and it's moving the trees and
transforming the landscape so it looks to him like a line in a psalm book and then he says what we fight
for is so tiny what fights against us so great if only we would allow ourselves to be moved as things do
by some great storm then we would grow strong too and not need names and then this is crucial is for
when we win it's with small things and the victory itself keeps us small what is extraordinary does
not want to be moved and bent by us and then he compares um the poet to you know a musical instrument
being played by an old testament angel yeah and yeah this is what's going on this is what's obvious in
your work this part of why we're having this conversation right you are you are a you are a
bard in in in the archaic sense right and your passionate awareness of the beauty and the potential
of nature the bio the organisms the biosphere the possibilities of intelligent human communality
and all of this you sing so beautifully and constantly and passionately of this uh you know
it's it's a fingerprint i recognize right it's a fingerprint that's related to the origins of virtue
justice music not justices in vengeance justice is in beauty yeah yeah truth is as in the fulfillment
of of the most uh desirable aspects of being in relation in speech you know in the world of humans
you are a star my friend i've watched you shine well i had five cancellations today because of the recent
piece i wrote on on the heart you know about why the left fails because they think they're going to win
an argument through logic when you know they should be brandishing poetry yeah yeah or at least um at the
very least you know profoundly compelling rhetorical figures right well i mean i i give my you know i've
made an illusion before of like going and hanging out the great speckle bird underground newspaper and
they took me to the byron pop festival which was woodstock south and that was my first introduced
introduction to lsd you know jimmy hendrix on his last tour of the united states played
and i just i remember watching it from above but the more profound thing happened during the time
after that where piedmont park was the hub of hippiedom um as it wasn't you know in haight-asbury
there was an aspect of you would have beings in the park well you had sort of these beings in the park
that i'd have to drive leave my neighborhood and go through this really tough at the time now it's
hyper gentrified but working-class neighborhoods where the guys would be working on their cars with
marlboro reds rolled up in their sleeves and their hair full of royal crown and um they chased us into
the park um you know they were gonna kick our ass and give us a haircut and um but when they went in
there they encountered something that that they they were first of all beautiful women there were
all these hippie nixies and you know gypsy queens and you know just all you know all over the place
and these women there was kind of a cracker lisa strata where they you know these rednecks looked at
them and they they questioned their life so you'd see them coming back and the royal crown would be of
their hair and their they would their hair would become blanker and they'd be laying back on the grass
as the almond brothers the almond brothers used to play for free and they go oh man delane's guitar
shooting sparks into my head and there would be this and so what happened during this period of
time i watched how art was transforming people and you know okay the great speckled bird had its writers
and they had a part of it too but you seduce somebody from the mute with the music then you can put the
poetry then you could then you can put the the political zero mods you could put all that in
place but first this architecture of transformation had to happen whereby they were seduced by something
you know later when i was writing comedy i you know that was my first real job as a writer is writing
comedy wow and it was um the trouble is they played you in eight balls and oh great yeah and then that there
was a demon there i mean literally there was a creature when that if you did cocaine it would
tell you you can't be funny without me i saw so many comics destroyed by that you know i wrote jokes for
people all kinds of people famous and not famous but it was like i saw what happened and that was the
thing of when i quit cocaine and found a mentor that was really kind of shamanistic of what spirits you
listen to and what's what you don't and there is a spirit uh you know of alcohol of cocaine of those
things that just wants to live through your body and get high and you know and then it'll lie to you
it'll you were just talking about how do you know this is your friend that made me think yeah there is
there's one that shows up and it has exactly the voice of the helper that that helped you get over
cocaine but it somehow talks to you you know like it's like the guy that shows up at your house and
knocks on the door and he always gets a free lunch out of even their swear you're never going to do
it again you know so there are spirits like that that come in but they can be very helpful like one
of the last things i heard a mentor of mine james hillman say is you know you either have the archetype
or the archetype has you and so that so when these voices come into your head you better have a
conversation with them and keep your eye on it and i think that's really what it says is i you know like i
said earlier that bad poetry that young people write that starts the dialogue that gets the helper's
attention um if they keep going and they have some capacity i don't know i don't know what talent is
you know i think talent is a is what you're describing is the ability to survive the the rilkean angel
you know the the ability of to realize i don't know you know bob dolan says i don't know where these
those early songs came from and then he sort of points up where carl young going when he's asking
a later interview does he believe in god he says no i don't believe in god i know there is a god there
is an aspect but you're going to have to be willing to be transfigured by that and that's hard to do
not that i have the courage for it every moment of the day there oftentimes i'm going no i don't
really want to look over there i'm afraid of you know i'm just really can't take the decimation right now
there's too much going on can you approach me at a later day when i'm having a good day
and i feel like i can handle things
phil are you a musician i see nails on this hand um yeah that's for picking a little bit my ukulele and
good yeah yeah i lose myself in that yeah so you know we moderns i think we are um
um unfortunately very confused about the originary aspects of what we call art and particularly music
and theater because these things were not um mere pleasantries or entertainments they
you know the other night my son and i were playing with some synthesizers that i have and one of them is
quite unusual and we entered into this state of like basic disbelief right we were we would make
noise we would make a noise on the synthesizer we just look at each other like what you know
and what i realized i've been a musician since i was around 16 and um but what i realized that
night which i'd never realized before is that when we make sounds we are changing the shape of something
resembling our soul or the expressive organ of our soul it's changing its mode right and the ancients
were clearly aware of this and it wasn't just in music what was going on in theater
was psygenic um medicinal it wasn't like you're going to see something for entertainment that i don't
think it was mandatory you go to the theater yeah you have a hundred thousand people wait you know
wailing and crying over the over the fate of agamemnon yeah and and i think from what i understand there
was like a sort of a purgation that would happen in the beginning right there was sort of this purging
um a cleansing thing where you get rid of the stuff you sort of brush away you couldn't be a citizen
without an initiation probably taking something a lot like a magic fungus of some kind yes and then you
were ready for citizenship otherwise you were completely unqualified to be in the agora you know
precisely yeah and i think that's what's missing now and that like you said like i heard recently um
somebody talking about um marsilio ficchino a neoplatonist during the renaissance hugely
influential and when you talk about the artistic life of florence at that time he should be mentioned
but he's not and he was a musician played his lyre and you know his his father was a doctor and
he he treated the head of the medici family and ficchino when he was a boy just talked to the man and
the man said somebody needs to educate this boy he's brilliant but his education happened and
ficchino got insecure he didn't feel like he was pleasing his father so he became a doctor himself
and he became became very discouraged and depressed and so he picked he played the lyre
in the tradition of the greeks and he sang a prayer to orpheus and at that moment he was
convinced there was a knock on the door and there was a letter that he was going to be sponsored by
the menichee family to be a teacher and um and he all and so i think we have to remember that music
that we are attracting i mean the trouble is that you know so many of the musicians from the 60s for
example in other times um if you're going to embody dionysus you know jim morrison even got the ponchi belly
that is described before the end you are this is you know i was writing uh a piece recently and i
i used brugal the elder in it and a number of paintings from the argument the argument the war
between uh carnival and lint i don't know if you're so you look it up if it's extraordinary paintings
of and so spirits the carnival is spirit you know you we are carried along like the spirit of christmas
or the spirit of alcohol those are living entities that come in and possess us in a carnival and
sometimes we get grifted because when the spirits are high you can get your pocket picked very easily
and the money is flowing out of you but then comes lent which is soul making you're walking on the earth
you know and and you you you have descended and you know if and if we're talking about orpheus that's
why rilke was so so obsessed with orpheus you know rilke there's a descent so like i mentioned with
kerouac you can have that upbeat you know in in in the sonnets to orpheus rilke is grieving over the
the death of a friend a friend of his his child and that's where the beginning of the poem comes to him
he's looking at a tree growing nearby and he's seeing the branches and he sees them as a string
instrument but the roots are going down to the dead and he thinks of orpheus's descent and he
thinks of the life of the poet and their realms in it where they're they're the spirits of dead
children the souls of them around but there's also in the poem there's always descent and there's always
lifting um and you meant you mentioned musical instruments you know yeah there there is um the
minor fall the major lift as leonard cohen put it right right right and so you know that's if you're
going to deal with music you are like you said you're putting yourself on that vibrational level
and you're opening yourself up to that is something is going to be transformative i think the danger
though is you have to always like um the kino did give the credit to orpheus give the credit to hermes
that there is a way if you go what a good boy am i then you're going to get the rock star grandiosity
which might you know gods live forever we don't and that's why so many of them didn't make it
no this was a major um part of my experience and that i had to navigate because there was a
so there was a second instance of the phenomena um and that instance was different at first i thought
it was the same thing because my mind the same thing was happening as far as i could tell right
but over time i realized that um whatever it was that was teaching me again it had an agenda
first thing didn't have an agenda and the second thing didn't have a sense of humor the first thing
had a sense of humor it was very beautiful and non um non-shaming right kind of sense of humor
like a divine sense of humor and the first thing which you know being whatever you want to call it
it loved it loved the earth it loved the living things not a fan of machines at all
romantic spirit generally isn't yeah love the humans right realized how um deprived and confused they
are but loved them yeah second thing didn't evince love humor it had a goal right and its goal was
basically essentially to like i'll make you great i'll make you great you connect me the humans i'll
make you great and i did i didn't sign up for that there's something metastopolies about that yeah
yeah right like this is a familiar trope that i've seen i've heard this before yeah yeah i'm not i'm not
up for that but even during the first experience uh i i struggle with megalomania right you know um
and even in the aftermath you know i am a different thing from my fellow humans it seems to me i've
seen worlds that i think very few of them have glimpsed um but that's made me much more humble
rather than me like this is not a thing i go around talking about generally at all i don't i haven't
written a book i'm not i don't usually introduce it into conversation um mostly i just prefer to explore
what i learned and to continue to develop those insights
in a way that i hope is helpful or you know beautiful for other human beings
yeah well i'm yeah i'm struck by uh like you know i've mentioned um the change jeffrey kripal
of change in an instant you know he talks about this stuff comes about generally through trauma getting
struck literally getting struck by lightning and a very nice middle-class jewish lady who's
you know when she sees her her body laying on the ground she she sends her children into the
shul it's the anniversary of her um of her grandfather's death and she had a nice dress
and nice shoes and as she's entering the parking lot of the synagogue there in dallas um a huge
thunderstorm breaks out and she sends the older kid to the door he's about four and then reaches for
the younger kid but she's holding an umbrella but just before he's reached him she's struck by lightning
and she remembers following the kids into the temple but being disturbed that everybody's not
noticing her not nice shoes and her dress and they're only talking to the children but everybody's
moving over to a window and she sees herself you know laying there smoking but and a call goes for a
doctor and this is a synagogue so it's full of doctors including the special that the specialist in
electric being electrocuted so she's she's she's literally doesn't have she's out for five minutes
in cardiac arrest but she says she spends six months in heaven talking to what she thinks is
her grandfather but over time she realized she's talking to god yeah but she couldn't have handled it
at first if it was god but she comes back with extraordinary abilities she sees she does literally see
the future orbs show up in her house phone calls come from the dead that her husband hears but she's
so different the marriage doesn't last she's shown on the other side a child she's gonna have and the
reason she was gonna go you know go through life but she was she says i am no longer whoever this nice
jewish lady was i am something else entirely yeah and and so you know people have the experience you
described that's what made me you know think of that changed in an instant it's very important what
you say um and that's a beautiful story i've also i used to go to meetings in berkeley of the um of i
ands which is the international association of near death studies and these you know often the meetings uh
in those meetings people who uh had died or had nearly died would you know tell their stories and um
you know before i talk too much about near death and after death experiences and so forth
something very profound you said that has more than simply occurred to me which is that
encounters with um severe injury illness trauma um and it doesn't have to be even something physical
right uh emotional trauma or you know family dissolution or something like this right these places
these place aspects of ourselves in an orientation
that is much more likely to either call or attract power and so you know in in this sort of like a
science fiction story right where a kid figures this out as a little kid because the first time he breaks
his leg or something right he sees angels or whatever so he starts engineering survivable catastrophes in
order to invite stronger and stronger powers right he's you know getting out um and there's an aspect of our
psychology that's a little bit like that too because we know you know in a simple way that if i send
signals for help something comes humans other things right and sometimes the not helping helps
because you're used to you know like you're a child and you're used to being rescued right you're used to
some some so you know i think so sometimes when we are in the wasteland there when we are in the abyss
um just that the lesson is even though things are plateauing just keep you know like the like the
statement goes uh when you're in hell keep going right yeah yeah i mean sometimes it's going to be
virtual but other times probably the same thing might be true in heaven right when you're in heaven
keep going right yeah i imagine but see that that's the thing is like in the kabbalah for example
we we the the name of god you know if you look into the torah for example you know they don't spell god
out they did because it's it's it's a name that shouldn't be pronounced much like it's probably not
even possible to do that so you know and that then the aspect of like if you look at the tree of life on
you look at the you know the tree of life you know these aspects of the these different you can't
really call them hierarchies they're more of a interdimensional lattice with no hierarchies yeah
exactly so this is uh for gemetria yeah which is what the angel was teaching me okay it taught me
hebrew right i don't know what whether four there are four thousand words i mean so you got
right right um no it didn't just it mainly didn't teach me the language it mostly taught
me the alphabet and some key ideas um but you know this is if i call it the angel i don't know
what i have a pet name for it but um but what i'm getting at is well actually never mind what i'm
getting at i have some other questions for you do you often i'm gonna just change the channel here
if that's okay for a minute um do you often recall your dreaming experiences well that one was extremely
transformative involving hermes and this this is what i would think was the life-changing dream two
of them wow on the same thing i'm i'm i mentioned being a comedy writer pretty dissatisfied um i've got
that voice in my head that said you know robin williams joke is far better than one i can come up
with about it's god's way of telling you're making too much money and i i was not that there was i was
born to do something else apparently because i'm dreaming i'm in my apartment in los angeles and i
think it's an earthquake because and it is an earthquake of the psyche coming but but the house is
shaking the apartment is shaking and i open my door and in charge is a bull elephant and he graphically
rapes me and we're talking about full pachyderm penis leathery you know sinewy everything penetrating
me and i wake up in terror you know i mean you know what is going on here uh and um so i um i leave
los angeles and to go stay with a friend after i'm describing how miserable my existence has become
and he says well just have a room and just go back there and write and so i went back there and
voices started showing up in my head in a contrapunctual way and i just started working on a play
and um as these characters were um showing up and the play was about this hyper controlling person who
would come into money but rented apartments uh he rented out his house in the hollywood hills and um
all the different hollywood characters were living there um and but he just enjoys being an antagonist
and destroying their journey you know a lot of them are flaky yes but some of but he just enjoys being
taking them down as far as having this discerning intellect um you know i mentioned the word
metastopoly and finding the place um to leave them powerless because he's hyper controlling it had some
trauma in his life lost his parents quite young it inherited this place from an uncle um and
he um he actually worked in an emergency room because not so much he liked pain he just liked being in
control and so between that he so a flood comes in in the play and the and a mudslide and everybody comes up
out of their apartments and they're in his and the the confrontation that happens with them where he
has a nervous breakdown including a poltergeist in the radio that plays appropriate music or comes on
with the right things so there is a so as i'm as i'm finishing up the first draft to this play um i have
a dream i go to sleep i'm on a train we're moving to a desert landscape i get this idea you know like you
know how they do an indie you climb up on the top of the train and you look at the landscape go by
so i start to go up through my play but my play is blown into the desert and i get off of the train
and i'm trying desperately to scatter the you know pick up the pages and this elephant numbers up to me
and i go oh no and he goes no it's not like that this time phil all you have to do is touch me and i can
move 10 000 moles an hour if you want so uh trepidation i touch him and we do it's like this
you know those movies where the starship enterprise takes off and and he takes me to an identic realm
and you know literally a place where lions are laying down with lambs and animals are everywhere
and he goes to cool himself in this pool and uh a figure walks up to him to me and he says i'm the
keeper of the lake um and i said um yeah but um i play and he goes don't worry it's just on a train
to north carolina it's back on the train you can stay here as long as you need to and so i wake up
now interesting like the way these synchronicities work the first place that play was um was done in
north carolina um that's where the commission and i got a stipend to go up there and so but what that
taught me was um the hermes which is gnish the elephant god the god of the crossroads
of new places in life um he is their hermetic figure um he i was turning my back on something i
needed a direction i needed to go and it entered me through the only orifice possible because i was
literally being an and that's there's a there's five comedy skits there yeah and um so what that
taught me like i said these dreams have been significant at different places in times where
i felt like i had run out you know after a divorce for example a dream where i am in a train station and
i'm lost and a really cute girl with beautiful cheekbones comes up to me and she tries to pick
my pocket and i catch her and she looks at me and she goes oh and we go on the train and we pick
pockets so we can survive and that was the dream that happened right before i discovered tarot cards
oh wow emissary once again of how to live you know she was you know she was dressed in furs and she
was just you know an emissary again of how do you live a life um the bohemian life we were talking
about early on how do you how do you how do you deal with necessity but she when the train
dropped me off at the terminus point there was this vast beautiful reservoir um that i stood looking at
and she kissed me on the cheek and disappeared and so it was you know what what was what was going on
there is it showed me there is a reservoir still here right now you can't find that you feel lost
in this place of transition but it's coming along um just hold on right like the old gospel song you
know paul and cyrus bound in jail had no money for to make their bail keep your eyes on the prize hold on
paul and cyrus thought always lost the dungeon shook and the chains fell off keep your eyes on the prize hold
on um so you know that that's the way that during those periods and you know i think i'm kind of in
one of those periods now where um you know where the culture seems so terrifying and you know i go how
do i contribute to this with my writing i don't want to say the same things i've said in essays for
years i don't want to work on the the same criteria how do i how do i keep this vivid alive
um and engages in the process engages the audience but also works on the soul making
that happens when you you are writing honest you're writing honestly you know i've been in the place
sometimes you have to be in the place of you're just going to sit down and you're going to put one
word in front of the other and you're not going to feel it and you have to do that till the muse you
know takes pity on you or yes you know you you just have to do that yeah you have to make your
writer that's what you're going to do you're going to write yeah you make the milk until the nectar
comes right right then make the best milk you can make right you go ahead and be disappointed and know
that it's not alive yet that's fine but then if you keep doing it something someone something comes
and uh infuses your interiority with passion and urgency and love and insight and new ways of seeing
right i think i think there are mentor spirits yes and you know like i have mentored young young guys
before yes you know and it's it's and something comes alive it's like the old archetypal tale of
the knight that thinks he's done you know and he gets up and he's creaky and everything hurts and
he thinks he thinks his days of adventure you know going after the grail or and then the young knight
knocks on his door and the calling comes again yeah there's something that happens and i you know if
that's if there is a spirit that infuses us to go question the world to look for the grail i imagine
this is going on in the spirit world too yes yes and um you know something that only recently occurred to
me it's a very complex backstory i'll try and be simple about it um i remember the experiences that i had
right and it and they were absolutely like there was it was terrifying but it wasn't the kind of
terror that i'm used to it wasn't terror of bad things happening that all of that fear was completely
obliterated it was terror of beauty there's some poet it might have been rilke said something like
i'm gonna paraphrase wildly here be thankful you've never encountered an angel because if you did your
heart would rip itself out of your breast and beat itself to death on the ground right and that that
you know resembled my experience very directly but um what i'm getting at is
you know i have this this kind of hiss i've studied something that you might call the the development of
human consciousness over time right people like bruno snell wrote about this julian janes in his book
on the bicameral mind there there aren't too many books that i've encountered about it but i'm
fascinated by the topic what what were the minds of our ancestors of the ancients like and i don't
want to know i'm not just curious about this ideologically i want to have experiences they had i suspect
they are not gone but are alive somehow in me and reachable right so that we can have the direct
experience of what it was like to look up at the sky 50 000 years ago as a as a human being
but um where am i going here did i lose my thread so oh yes yes so i remember the ex the absolute
ecstasy of this companion of having this companion intelligence with me but it was also catastrophically
stressful so it was ecstatic and stressful so when it when it began to fade you know it sort of went in
a curve right and it began to fade that was relieving but it was also frightening have i done something
wrong have i messed this up or whatever just like a child might feel um but what never occurred to me
until fairly recently was that the gods or the diamonds or the angels there's they're experiencing
something similar by interacting with us it's not a one-way relationship right they are ecstatically
fascinated by the possibilities of matter and and being in matter and one of the ways they can be
in the material layer is through human beings yeah so it's it's very complex this uh this situation
much more so than i think we are ordinarily inclined to imagine especially because many of
these matters are literally unimaginable well without direct poetry is the way you imagine it like i don't
know if you've read wallace stevens the idea of order at key west you know and other you know
wallace stevens is a poet that really gets though though he you know is a modernist but he the
complexity of his prose he does not come out and say it like we're we're attempting now to find words
for it he does find a word words for it by elliptical means and then not in the idea of order at key west
which is a dialogue between him and the ocean and his muse and he's asking who's writing this poem
essentially um but you know he he asked in a poem he asked um the angel do the angels
dream of the green corn here you know in other words where is it you know how you know we are here
we taste we touch we know flesh and i imagine that um these beings are infinitely curious about that
experience and like the way um a good teacher learns just by teaching they they go to reach the student
they find parts of themselves that they didn't know were there i don't know if you've ever had those
dreams where you and you you're in a house that's similar to the one you live in but yes it has rooms
you didn't know were there very recently yes and creatures in it and all of those kind of things you
know this is something um you know like for example the sufi poets use these experiences of the you
know the boarding house type places where the soul with the soul is a boarding house in some way and so
i think that these entities like for example you know you're going to if you lived in an old boarding
house setup like some woman who thought her life was over when her husband dies and she and her kids
are gone and she has this big house and then all of a sudden these people are coming you know are coming
into the boarding house and they're and that by their interaction with each other they're transforming
each other there might be a you know in the old days there might be a vaudeville act that met and they
hit it off and you know they tore together there is some way that when we we and to relate this what
you were talking about about um these non-corporeal entities um they i think they are transformed you know it's
not a one-way thing they realize that altruism is helpful even probably in their realm yes yeah i mean
there was one ex one brief moment of the experience that i had where the the being that was teaching me
or my companion it basically just asked permission to have my hand and it it showed me things about our
hands that are i'm not going to go into it but are catastrophically like revelatory um but it was
like yeah in all of the universes this thing here is so precious like nothing almost nothing lives long
enough to get one that explains a recent conversation sorry to interrupt no please a friend of mine was
talking about um you know on his his first acid trip i think he was talking about psilocybin but it was like
he just realized lips right um chickens don't have lips cats don't have lips but i have these lips right
and there's something extraordinary about being in this incarnation right now and and a lot of people
i said you know a lot of people and i remember quite young when i did my first acid trip it was my hand
yeah i just it had the same experience of this wonder at this you know of what this is and so you know
it's interesting you bring that up directly after that conversation um so of course i gave him
permission right it's like yeah of course and this was the only time that he expressed something like
childlike awe his enthusiasm went through the roof he was like oh my god you have wait you have pockets
with things in them and i felt him reach into my pocket and just explore and it was completely
it was ab so absolutely novel to his experience i use the you know i use the gender loosely here
but yeah it was so novel to his experience that was like a kid on a rocket ship or so it was just
absolutely out of his mind with joy well that would be like those those extraordinary dreams we were just
talking about i mean maybe when they come into their this realm this realm is their dream and yes
yes brilliant he's having this extraordinary dream of discovery about this because it's like i mean
that see that's what we're getting at okay we were talking about psychedelics will give you that feeling
oh my god i never thought about how incredible pockets were and then you woke up you know you write
it down and you wake up the next day and you go yeah pockets something that mundane right but then you go
but then really when you're in that experience of the heightened numistic numinous experience
it is about that aspect of exploration about how much we limit ourselves yeah and it's not going
to be every time you know um this this flip like diane basilica or jeffrey kripal or others talk about
you know it's not going to be abducted by an alien like whitney strever you know that's
but there's going to be like i'm walking down um the street with my son one time we first came back
in atlanta and we're airbnbing and uh you know i've got my son he's a child and we're going to cross
not a particularly busy street but a street that has traffic on it from time to time so when your
parents you you've probably been through this if your parents are really scrutinized up and down the
street before you commit and we i have my dog and so we cross the street but i feel a vehicle
right after we passed go behind me and i glance over and there is what seemed what close i can
describe it as a chassis of a car no wheels and it's a you know it is silver and it is just
and so i don't want to say to my son who at the time i was nine and a half i didn't want to say did you
see that too i wanted to say did you see something behind this that i missed and i had him describe
it he saw the same thing he described it he said except he said there were old-fashioned wheels on it
i mean old-fashioned tire i mean not wheels but um headlights on it like an old-fashioned car
so something there something was there you know what um would be called high strangeness
it came into our you know came into our life like that and so it was not so much um the actual
experience but it was like what is this the world is more than i can possibly imagine that this odd little
thing came by it's odd little thing just to show me hang on a little bit the more is going to be
revealed you know further along we'll know all about it right as the old gospel song goes further along
we'll know the reason why you know and uh be happy my brother live in the sunshine further along
well you know in the sweet by and by so there's this aspect of like every once in a while we get
something like that you know we get you know this happened during my mother's illness as she was
leaving this world and so i just i i have a tendency to think that every once in a while
things like that will happen not so much for their literal take on it but just just like music the
feeling it leaves you know um as a child i was pretty precocious and i realized very quickly that
the adults were living in worlds that don't exist that are literally just fictions often they were
fictions of language right this is a that here is what happened right um and i quickly understood
i mean not in a way that i can articulate like i can now but i was aware of this problem right the
adults are living in a world that it's not real it's in their thinking right and they're speaking that
they're that they see this world and so i quickly became both a fan and a student of anomalies right
i went looking for the things that violated the fictions that domineer in our cultures and i pay
close attention to them you know in um the writings of castaneda i don't know how familiar you may or may
not be with them but don juan proposes that our entire experience of the world is not real it is
something we are constructing moment to moment consensus reality yeah and there is like a field
effect right this is what you were talking about when you spoke of the park into which the you know
militant rednecks would come right they don't realize they're enter you're going into the water
there buddy and you may think you're going to fight that water but you wait until those the music
and the women and and the goodwill and the beauty right it's going to get you right it's going to
you think you know what you're up to but you're actually in in what robert anton wilson might say
you're like shifting reality tunnels and you're not prepared for that right you think you know what's
going on right and i was reading um it's funny i don't know how to pronounce his last name which is
hilarious i was reading bio echo malafe i don't know if you know this this facebook uh his facebook
presence but he was writing this morning something that really profoundly i thought was beautiful he
was saying he was about to do an interview and the woman kept asking him um you know would you please
uh pronounce your last name for me he said no have a go at it and she's like no no i don't want to do
that just just at least pronounce it once and then i'll try it's like no just just just have a have a go at
it and she was very nervous and she finally you know did it and he said you know in you know in the
yoruba uh in our in our way of life we don't expect people to say things right we're open to
the insight or the god that may appear in their in their mispronunciation of a word or our name
right and this is also very true in music if you're composing a song and you're trying to do
it right okay now if you're playing music from sheet music that's different right the goal there
is to get it right but if you're composing a song on an instrument like the guitar or the piano
and you make mistakes it's very very apparent if you're if you're in any way creative that something
speaks to you through the errors right there's you know writes quite a bit about that yeah yeah
there's this isn't um it's not a matter of right or wrong and i think it's also very important
forgive me if i get a little bit on my soapbox about this i'll i'll keep it minimal
to understand that um as males we maybe we make it scripted to dismiss things which we can determine are
not true right right if the girl comes to us and she says you know blah blah blah blah we're like
that's not true right and then it's over with right we think like we got now we know what's going on
this is one of the worst things that could possibly happen to a human being is to know what's going on
right when you know what's going on first of all you're almost invariably wrong secondly you're so
delimiting what's going on that your chances of liberty are basically zero i mean there are
exceptions right it's not a lot when you get it right like you said this is why the the hero dies
this is the tragic hero as he keeps believing by doing i know that what comes to me is that
image of jason underneath the argo he's totally blown it but he's reliving his glory and the argo
collapses on him and kills him this is the athlete saggy in front of his trophy case
this is you know the idea that we we got it right that one time but our template
was dead on correct but we keep trying to use that template now this is the problem it's the
improper transfer of a template from one aspect of experience or being or becoming to all aspects
right and one of the worst places this happens is the expectation of physical continuity that we get
from the physical world like my door is not going anywhere it's always it's going to be there tomorrow
and the next day it's always going to look the same right and we transfer that onto things of the
mind or the soul or the creativity and that's insane those things are not like that door and even the
door but it gives us anxiety though that you know we want the world to be just so we want there to be an
explanation for it and it is the anxiety that comes over us i mean the greeks describe it as pan
going into the agora is that there's panic and pandemonium when all of a sudden you know
this musky animal and this is the thing this is keeping the sense of humor part about it is humor you
know looking at it more like the marx brothers combining it with karl marx if you're a commie
right i mean you know you don't want to become one of those humorless doctrinaire commies it's always
correcting everybody and their their writing is just horrible and then so it's like you you know
pan's mother's kind of ashamed of him and she wants to put him up on olympus and sneak away and
the gods come out and they're looking at his antics and the gods can't agree on anything but they agree
they like him and he's funny so they form a panorama around him you know and so you know
they're always but something about the jealousies the rivalries when they're looking at pan falls
away and when we're taking when we are in that place where we want the just so stories we want
it to be just the way things are so everything buttoned down and that's what i was talking about
that early play of mine was about a character that wanted that and then that same kind of chaos comes
into his life um that that there is a element of panic that comes about and i can give you a whole
experience i can give you an experience about of synchronicities about that about um no let's have one
well my first wife and i um about to take a trip to europe um and so what we noticed in the newspaper
choice carol oates is just going to give a talk at emory university a few blocks from there so we walk over
here and she she reads a poem that strikes me about the playing of marcius um the satyr that he he
picks up a musical instrument it's athena's thrown it away because she does not like the way what's
later called this pipe pan pipe makes her face scrunch up when she plays it and he learns and marcius
learns to play it and so much so that um the other woodland creatures are saying to him
oh you play as well as apollo himself now marcius doesn't agree but he i guess he doesn't stop him
fast enough or the damage is already done because apollo lands on earth and challenge him to a contest
that is judged by apollo's own muses so you know life is rigged from the start right and so when apollo wins
he plays he plays the skin off of marcius so um the night before that i had had a dream of sitting in
paris um and a goat had come up out of the soup of the bowling bags i was eating and ran through the
streets of paris so we get we we're not scheduled to go to paris so we we had cheap um got a cheap right
to brussels on sabina airlines and we we get off and there's a torrential rain happening there in
belgium and we get on a bus and we just get off it randomly and we go into a museum just oh there's
a museum great let's put us right in front of us we're soaking wet and go in there and the first
thing i see is exactly the painting that the poem is based on now we were cold and we said okay before
we go back to paris we go to paris let's go to greece and warm up so we go to this island and
you know i'm scribbling poetry and she my wife at the time was an artist and she did really good
caricatures and sketches and people are giving you know the island everything's because she's drawing
the people on the island and anything we need they're bringing us and i am and but this phenomenon
starts happening of the goats start looking in the window of our cottage and i think okay this is
something the goats do so i'm asking the farmers and people i said the goats do that to everybody
and they go no just you as we're walking down the street the goats will leap out and you can ask my
first wife about this they would follow us down the streets and so i'm so there is a way that i
before that what brought on me leaving la and were panic attacks but then as i started to deal
with this by art and look deeply in it this this this musky animal god of the body you know and as
i was mentioning before this was the time of the punk rock era where you would go to clubs and you
would dance remember the bumper stickers that said art let's dance right and that sort of thing i was
really kind of into that aesthetic at the time and so what i'm saying is that my life has been filled
with these dreams and synchronicities like that at times and i can give antidote after antidote about
transitions where that happens but this is what i was saying before about when you know the the um
vehicle came down the street and what you're saying about i can see why this creature was so interested
in your hand is because there are guiding hands somehow and it's it's not the invisible hand of the
market but there is a there is a market there is a place of souls an agora of souls where there are
these helpful hands that come about and you know like i said i don't want to i don't want to over
elaborate on what that can be you know as um let the mystery be as the song goes yes yes this is very
important there's a few other things that i was on the track of and one of them is um i just got to get
my plug by all means take you know if you whatever you need yeah um so
you know i was listening to rivake yesterday and he was talking about four different kinds of
knowledge i think they were propositional procedural perspectival and participatory
and they use different kinds of memory you know he's a cognitive scientist among other strange things
and um this is another problem we don't realize there are different kinds of knowledge
right these are these he's saying that these are different kinds of knowledge okay great that's
these are obvious you can give examples of them you know it's blatantly kissing is is you know
participatory knowledge right to kiss another human being it's not is it true right it's not a
procedure right it's you know participatory but what we don't realize or what is uncommon for us to
realize is there are different forms of truth right and the kind of truth that is associated with facts
has a very narrow scope right within that narrow scope it's quite real but you know as a student of
science fiction authors there's a different kind of truth in there which is perspectival right it gives you
perspectival truth it's not talking about things that are actually exist so when we you know and
and there's dangers on both sides right there's dangers of well you can come to believe things
that are nonsensical and then behave in the world and in relationships as if these nonsensical things
are true or good or veritable or something that that's part of our human experience right we can
we can get it wrong in a way that is problematical for us and others but um getting it right is often
very problematical too right so because what you've done is you sort of narrowed the scope of reality
and potential to a manageable feature and part of the reason why we do this and part of the reason why
it produces anxiety as you were discussing is that um and this is just a toy i'm not saying this is
how it is but underlying human concern and awareness are can't you can look at it through a lens where
there are three principles and one of them is ambiguity and the middle one is vigilance and the
third one is prediction so when there's ambiguity right i live in a dead box you see all those squares
back there all them rectangles right it's not an accident that stuff's all rectangular that stuff's
not going anywhere right it's just going to stay like a frame for the rest of time pretty much right
and it's not going to move and i don't have to pay attention there's no ambiguity right those squares
evict ambiguity and we live in boxes that evict ambiguity and part of the reason we do that
part of the reason obviously for shelter and it's you know convenient to build them whatever but
it reduces vigilance and vigilance is a burden and what happens when vigilance gets amplified
by ambiguity is humans have anxiety and they panic yeah we can see that going on in our culture in a
way we can see the results of these upsurges in ambiguity various domains of ambiguity sudden rather
suddenly right over over short periods of time and then you got people who are just going to surf that
shit right humans go nuts they're panicking i can i can just come in and own that whole like i'll just
own that country right i'll take the whole damn thing because it's it's ripe for capture right and
opportunists like musk and trump and putin and others have realized in a sense well they're just
running fictions anyway so now why not run mine right now there can be there can be propitious
fictions and there can be dangerous fictions we agree my mother left nazi germany on a kinder
transport you know her father in socks and housing concentration camp um so you know like you say
these are dangerous times because demagogues can take take advantage of the ox that comes from
ambiguity especially when you go into the grocery store and you see the prices or people are worrying
about how to pay their rent and so go ahead please go ahead please continue okay so um this is the
thing about like is the story working at this moment my early days as a comedy writer i would go
around with um work for an impressionist i work for comics and you feel what the audience is feeling
mm-hmm and you can feel when they're hitting it just right or you can feel when the and so comics are
um kept a good comic has to be very aware of what's going on in the audience hopefully it'll be an easy
laugher there right and they'll get everybody going but that you know you can't hit you can't have that
luxury every time you you you have to be able to have and you know with tarot card readings that i did
you have to have a feeling of whether when you're talking about the archetypes that have been laid
down in their interaction with people you have to get a feeling of whether they're on the right track
it doesn't mean that you're just looking at their body responses but there's no way you can help
missing that and it's just all part of the process of telling the story about what these guards are
saying with one another and so if i would like for the days when i'm reading tarot cards if i'm just
working through templates i'm going to be bad at it yeah i'm going that's what you're saying you said
so oh this really worked last night when that card came down but if i expect it to work in that same
way and give the same vaudeville chameleon joke right you know these jokes have been waiting for 20
years as baggy pants chameleon chameleon comedian says that i said the word chameleon that's interesting
because that was it is yeah there is an aspect of the i think that you have to be i that
was one of those little intrusions you know one of those philip k dick moments also the bio was
talking about where the god comes in and speaks for you right and it's close to what you were going
to say but it ain't the same thing right and that is that was a hermetic moment that is yeah you can
call it by what you want but you might say we we maybe we invoked that by the previous recognition of
this you know potential please continue yeah so i i agree with what you're talking about about we
want to know the future we become hyper vigilant and you were talking about four functions there
well jungian psychology has that three okay vigilance ambiguity prediction you were talking about the
feeling sensation you were oh right right there are four kinds of yeah the four kinds of knowledge
four kinds of knowledge well okay you were talking about the kiss what came to my mind is eros eros the
son of aphrodite there is eros in that there is a living it's not only a function no only a type of
knowledge this knowledge comes by way of a god it's not even merely a god the god is an expression of a
principle that is from like this is one of the things that socrates was executed for saying
socrates was executed for saying no there's things even gods have to obey truth beauty right virtue other
things right at least this is squabbling with each other about that you know apollo's truths are going
to be different from aphrodite's truths yeah from athena's truths like and socrates was executed because
he started like promoting the finance bros of his time and he he upset the democracy there that didn't
like these rich boys that were operating outside of town behind the penis statues so you know i'm
not i'm not i'm not defaming him there but i'm just saying that yes those different and this is where
like i mentioned hillman before of i think we look we have a monotheism about like we want to know
so we i have a friend that's very anxious we've been friends he's a brilliant artist but he's been a
christian since we were teenagers after he took too much acid and he still plays my own fridays and
we talk and he is so fixed on the idea of the farther archetype and i'm not going to confront
him with him and saying this is because of your anxiety and you want to know that god is taking
things up in heaven and you're loved and you know every place you felt like a failing as a boy that this
is that god is in his heaven and they're there and and every he loves you if you don't sin and but
there and but i have talked to him about why christianity splits into so many schisms but by using
james hillman saying this is what monotheism does there's a multiplicity of energies and forms and
intelligences and feelings and sensations that are coming in and one god it's too much for one god
you know there might be a you know according to eastern belief a godhead but then it comes into all
these different diverse forms but if you're saying this is the only god you're going to be splitting all
the time also if you're also saying this is its only child yeah right both you got to have both those
fictions there right one god one child right and then from there one people you know you can just
keep doing the and then you're going to get genocide because that one people you know not just genocide
i mean what is the word for the obliteration of the womb of creativity intelligence literacy all these
things i don't know what the word is for that sterility would be the opposite of the wound becomes
the wound so you you know you the poet takes care of the wound so the new life comes out of it but it's
over sterilization a heaven that is over scoured with you know bleach and detergent to make it so clean
and perfect that you there you're going to get a sterility uh that you neither have spirit nor soul
you have yeah yeah so you know like when the um when islamic extremists invaded i think it was iran
and stuff right they went to the museums and just obliterated everything that was in there right and
we've seen this waves of this over and over in history and of course the the corollary in um
in capitalist culture is just commodify it right so you know they obliterated capitalism creates the type
of imperialism that brings that about right so you come in with modernity you cannot like for in iran
for example and you you install the shah right and he brings about this radical change but mo it would
probably be accepted if most of the people weren't kept poor by the oil flowing westward you know like i
remember in my working class neighborhood um things were fine and before inflation said you know that's
where those you had those redneck hippies forget willian elson going to austin you you had you had
redneck hippies and things were going really well um when people were smoking weed and dropping acid
but when the inflation started people started getting very ox ridden and conservative again
and the changes that were happening the modernity coming in you know with eight track tapes and trans
hands hands was just great you know girls and tube tops but then the the idea of when it when things
got expensive the idea of sin and a lot of them became christians because of their coke happening
so there was a you know and then the idea that the world is unstable now you have all this inflation
coming in i need some grounding i need some solidity i need daddy the father i mean here here outside of
atlanta there was a trump rally where um um the bow tied guys whose name is escaping me um that was at
fox very popular and then he got fired for you know certainly tucker carlson tucker carlson was speaking
and he went into this entire riff about daddy's coming home there's the infants poop on the walls and
the teenage sons watching porn and the daughter is you know wearing a dress too short i don't remember
the exact words but daddy's coming home and there's going to be a reckoning and so this aspect of daddy's
going to come home and set things right so we get the fear that comes in the museum early on where the
destruction of the library of alexander happens when the christians come in during the crusades there is a
aspect of where a a being that comes in that is born of the terror of the unknown you know this is
dovetailing and what we keep talking about about how do you let the unknown in with you know not only go
there's the risk of not anxiety but there's the risk of madness carl jung noticed he was the son of
a minister in switzerland and he noticed that in the asylum there in zurich
his his schizophrenic clients were speaking the language his father did in church
and so but they were possessed by this madness because uh the templates of modernity no longer
like i was describing athens where we went living with the gods where ezekiel for example talk about a
vision that is ineffable you know he's sitting there he was he was a priest in um in israel he's taken in
chains as a slave he's sitting on the jordan river you know eating his slaves lunch and then all of a
sudden over the jordan he has a vision of these rings of fire coming um and that's a real interesting
story in so far as um transformation goes he finds himself in the valley of bones
you know and a storm comes from heaven and this army of flesh rises and then later the last part
is quite beautiful and i'm not and and they don't name the temple it's not it's not the temple that
believed it's going to be restored according to jewish mythology but it is a temple that that is built
and it's extraordinary and exquisite and a small trickle of water starts coming out of the ground
and this ripple becomes a stream and the stream starts revitalizing the land until it goes and
revives the dead sea and all the creatures of the sea are restored and the land is well you know this
is a story of how this is a story not only what the christians told us the grail you know what what
heals the sick king or what health heals the sickness of the land as they're confronted with
with babylon um where he's being held but it's a story of the restoration of of the soul that is
happening by these type of transformation that comes from the flow state of water or the wandering in
the wasteland and all of these stories come about and who tell you know this is what wallace stevens is
asking in the idea of order in key west who the hell is telling the story this the ocean as he's
walking by it in key west is telling her story the muse is telling her story he has his version of it
and you know as any poet he's going which one well i you know which one should i pull i'll publish all of
them you know and that's the whole problem with monotheism is it needs it needs even i'm telling
the story of a of a people but i think you know the the the religion of my mother which is was judaism
they're born in nazi germany is that you know that constantly there is a new story that is going to flow
in first as a trickle and then as a deluge and whether that deluge is a drowning deluge or one
that restores the land depends on how you're going to approach it and it is better to approach it as
a slave than a king um yes agreed not that i'm triggering slavery i'm just agreeing that you are
going to be enslaved you know as bob dylan says you're going to serve somebody you're going to serve
something um yeah you know and maybe the right word is a servant rather than a servant or you know
but i think there's a certain aspect of um does the daemon enslave us because it's going to be one
way or another the daemon is going to come in and as james hillman points out in the soul's code if you
don't follow the calling of that daemon um it's going to just it's going to destroy you it's going to be
you're going to become a drug addict you you know you just you're going to there are going to be
ways that a dissipation is going to happen rilke put it this way um everybody has a letter written
inside of them and if you don't live the life your heart wants to live you don't get to read this
letter before you die so imagine a vast dead ladder office full of this correspondence and the feeling
you're going to see if you see that would be melancholy a depression will take you down to bring you
down to whatever's distract whatever's been distracting you and you got to deal with that
you got to meticulously open those letters one by one and it's going to be painful to read it
but to me that would be the enslavement that you would feel it's almost like um you know in
the story of rumpelstiltskin the the maiden being led into that room and she has to separate all that
grain from the shade same thing happens in the story of eros and psyche of separating the grains
from the shape if there is a way that that that's what i meant by kind of an enslavement the slave has
his task to do and the beulah land is going to come but it is the aspect of not master running you but
what are you going to be the master of your own soul and that's what's going to enslave you like
you know the the the entities that you're talking about the dialogue you're going to have with them
it's going to you know after a while the slave is going to become the slave and the master is going
to become the slave and they're indistinguishable from each other i mean and you know there's there are
other important features of this problem for us as human beings which is we're going to be serving
something yeah and if you can't find something i don't know exactly which words to use i'll try to
be careful if you if you can't really if you're not really sure what virtue is or beauty or justice um
um then you're likely going to end up serving things that are fictions of benefit yeah you're
going to serve things like convenience you're going to serve things like money you're going to serve
the representational layer that the humans establish and train their children into slavery too
that's going to suck for you for your children for your ancestors no one is going to be happy if you
do that yeah i'm going to be in the chorus and give a hallelujah to that because you see it everywhere
yeah you see our culture of distraction it's misery it's in miserating it's not just you know we imagine
oh i'm just a separate person i'm going to live and die and blah blah okay great even if that's true
this sucks but if that's not true if you're actually the embodiment of the entire sort of
you know library of of not just your ancestors but of life on earth and you're like the little
fingertip of that whole process you have the capacity to either see the thing is humans think
like you can't change the past well you can sure as fuck change the meaning of the past if you do
something profoundly beautiful which is something i know you ache and chase and quest to become every
time you set pen to paper even though maybe it's not a pen these days well i felt it when you said
immiserate i thought i thought about that function of what immiserates you it's what sets you down to do
that to open yourself up into a way that you can experience you know what yates says truth is beauty
beauty and truth that's all you are feeling all you need to know and justice too justice well yes athena
you know if you if you read uh you know the arrest i mentioned the agonies of agamemnon it's not going
to come out agamemnon a minute ago right there is um that where where is he when he goes to the oracle
of paulo after being you know these goddesses are chasing him with razor sharp teeth and
headdresses that are serpents and it's quite painful he's immiserated and he goes and paulo says
go put yourself on trial in athens so he goes and his defense attorney is athena justice and and so
she and so she she and the prosecuting attorney are these furies these ancient goddesses of revenge and
vengeance and so what happens in this trial what happens as the trial goes on is athena convinces them
to go from retribution to justice to going from immediately this kind of tyranny to the democratic
process she convinces them to become the kindly ones the enemies of the democratic process
um the the enemies of those who bear false witness the enemies of those who commit injustice so so
this is a story that is known that that is brought to us and we tell it and this goes back um to what
we're saying about like greeks had to sit through this and after in this uh after an initiation where
their consciousness was expanded to use the words that people don't say anymore you know there was you
you know where are you going to come across a conversation nowadays where people are going
to talk about that we're right here you know i you know i mentioned like seeing that wired um delusion
about we're never going to have a crash even though you know a few years later the tech crash is going
to come in a big way well next to it um i i think there was an article and i don't remember the publication
but i just remember you know throwing the one the wired and discussed against the wall and picking
up that one and as synchronous you would have it there was an article about the long-term effects of
lsd and the people didn't go psychotic their children didn't have gills you know all of these
things that we were told not to do it not not to do not to do acid the only one thing they have in
common is they don't take career seriously they realize that you know they might even have careers but
they don't take it seriously they're more likely to put it in the terms of archetypal psychology
to follow their daemon to follow the guiding spirit in their life and to understand what you were
saying about truth and beauty and the way you the immiseration you feel when and if you look at the
at the wasteland of our society built on distraction built on a kind of inconvenience yeah a dark
magician's distraction a dark magicianship of being able to take you know you there's that movie from
the 80s taken from the bradbury story something wicked this way comes yeah i think yeah what do
you want it's from what's your wish what do you want what's your wish what is it going to be that
you know metastopolian again but the immiseration of those nice middle-class people that never live by
their heart and you look like you're going to say all right so yeah there's a few things i want to
say so if we are not merely separate humans and we are in fact the uh sort of waves of the history of
life on earth and the humans that have come before us and our ancestors and so forth are landing in us
right now and being expressed into the world then when we are when we are capable and art is you know
one of these crucial um vehicles for this when we are capable of acts of beauty acts of justice and
some of those acts are just are simply speaking something more true than what is commonly on offer
right making the nectar of when i say the word justice i do not mean vengeance i mean something
like resurrection of virtue right that's what justice looks like to me the resurrection of virtue
and not in a puritanical sense in a relational sense right something so beautiful it is possible
for us even in this moment even in our speaking to do something so beautiful that the entire history
of life on this world like all those beings they get up and they're like yeah that thing that's what
we were talking that's why we lived and we died was for that to happen to become possible to be
enacted by a human being or a cohort of human beings or a group you know a living place the living
places are are um intrinsically heroic they don't do anything that's not heroic they can't veer from the
path the way humans do right we are we are endowed with the strange position in nature that we can do
something that is like we can evacuate the virtue and create a representation and then propagate that
it's vampiric yeah but i mean you know of course all things come with their opposites the heroic is
going to come with his shadow that makes him fall there yes there is a and so i think okay we don't
have a living lexicon that tells us of the dance between eros and psyche oh my god that might be the
most beautiful thing you said all day um you know psyche is the most beautiful woman on the planet
right according to the story and she's so beautiful and forth you know i mentioned this earlier with apollo
well aphrodite is upset by this and she comes to the town she lives in and says i'm going to destroy
the whole place and kill your family unless you sacrifice her to me so the family weeping brings
her to the altar and she's placed on the altar and there's the sacrificial blade and the blade goes up
in the air and everybody is weeping and renting their garments but then all of a sudden the blade
drops it clanks onto the altar and psyche lifts up and she's carried on a western wind and she's taken
to his palace very much like um cock to did in beauty and the beast you know where everything is
taken care of her wine glass is empty and um and a voice appears behind her and it's and the voice says
i am your husband i i will give you anything you want but i ask one thing of you
do not ever look upon me he makes an impossible request of course of a human being but then but
so she gets lonely and she asks okay i have a request can my sisters come visit me and like the
sisters in fairy tales and myths the sisters are up to no good right the sisters are jealous they
whisper in her ear they put poison pellets in there he must be a monster that's why you can't look at him
you know he's going to kill you you know how these guys are he's going to kill you and so that she's
living in fear the ox has come and she's laying in bed and one night she can't take it anymore and she
gets a lamp full of oil and sneaks over to his side of the bed and pulls back the sheets and there is
eros the most beautiful entity the son of aphrodite his golden skin and she shakes and lamp oil spills on
him and mars his beautiful skin and he weeps and he cries and says you of course she's a human being
she does the one thing she was asked not to do and right he flies away and psyche is immiserated after
this because she gets she falls you know she's no longer held up by the sepper she's on earth
and she becomes gaunt and she loses her looks at one function that one template that we try to use
and she's asking everybody and she has these little in certain stories she has this aspect
of where um she comes across this little help me like you know like supplies and supplies she
help me help me and she looks down and there's an ant with a golden crown and he's drowning in a
puddle and she helps him with a twig and another where an eagle is wounded by an arrow and she removes
him and nurses it and then she hears she she's asking everybody and then she hears it that eros
has returned to his mother's palace to aphrodite's house i don't know if he's in the basement eating
hot pockets and playing video games but he is but he is there and she supplicates herself at aphrodite's
door and aphrodite wants to keep this troublemaker away from her son you know this mortal and says
i'm going to keep her busy and i alluded to this earlier she leads her into a room where she has to
separate grain from shape you know this is like being led into a room full of cereal and there's
and you know there's cornflakes and there's fruit loops and and there's you know cocoa crisps there's
every type and you have to separate it right and so she begins weeping and what jung says about this
is in this weeping um she she summons the underworld the chthonic realms and the king of the ant this ant
emerges with an army with this ant with a crown because she had taken care of the little small things
and listened to what other people don't listen to and they separate the grain from the shave
and so aphrodite comes back and she's shocked and she has to give her another request and this is to
go out and make her a fleece from these golden sheep of the sun and it's futile she can't catch
them but she notices when they run through the brambles well you know unless they go they they make it
through the thickets and the that there's gold strands and she gathers them and gives them to
aphrodite so aphrodite thinks okay i have to think of something no mortal can survive and so she says she
gives her a pail and says go down to the left the river of death of course if any mortal goes even close
to it they pass out and they never wake up again and so psyche trudges down there and she passes out
but then she feels something lifting her and it is that eagle and he takes the pail and then brings
it back to aphrodite so she's aphrodite has to think of something undoable okay psyche i want you to
go to the underworld and for persephone the queen of the dead get the get a locket of immortality
and so along the way psyche is telling her tale as she descends and the shades are weeping
they're all moved by it she's even moving the dead by everything she's been through
and including persephone who gives her the locket and of course once again pandora comes into it and
she's given a more an immortal is given this and she opens it up and she passes out but eros has been
watching this and eros flies into the world and takes her to olympus and the only mortal ever allowed
on olympus and to be enthroned and to be with the gods is psyche um
thank you for that rendition that's very beautiful it's reminiscent of stories i've heard in of all
places blackfoot culture which is many thousands of years older than the greek stuff and we must imagine
that the greek stuff came from somewhere okay um right it wasn't just it didn't just pop up there
right um one of the things that that occurred to me while you were speaking
there's this concept of the the chorus right and it's related its relation to democracy the polis the
chorus um the democratic uh approach to which is very very different i think in its function in how
it worked in greece than it than it does here just add in the story i told earlier by all means
in the story earlier the chorus it would be the jury because that's also or the checks and balances in a
real democracy not the one we have now the chorus would be the citizenship that votes that and so with you
know that's what athena argues to the jury to let essentially arrest you off for killing mom
so there you know there there is an aspect of and i keep using the word aspect you notice that
because i'm relating my unconscious my soul is relating to things phil you're only giving part of
the story right walt whitman said i contain multitudes yes no this asked the idea of aspects is fundamental
even in like internal family systems or psychology or whatever you pick right biology right there are
aspects organs so to speak features i keep catching myself saying it maybe you can explain it well i i
actually had not noticed that you were perhaps overusing the word but it's a very common word for
me as well because you know we once again we think like what is something we know what something is
is really well what if you move your place in the amphitheater right now you approach it from another
angle is it still the same thing what do you see then what what is in precedence and what is backgrounding
what is the context it changes as you orbit so if we are to become wiser insightful we must have
mult at least two or three positions two or three positions of perspective on something not one
yeah this course antagonist protagonist as in great theater yes yes yes and that's where the fourth thing
comes about that you know there's a fourth thing that comes about like the four functions
in your immune psychology um they they that always there is a quaternity according to young
a transformation that happens by the triad becomes a quaternity and and like for example into
row cards you get four different functions that the sweets of them you get hearts for example cups
pentacles swords and there's four of them and then it's the interplay between those between those four
aspects and their different point of view on of it then that is what's creating you know the four
elements are also we're all we're getting the series of fours and i think that's why i keep catching
myself using the word aspect is i'm coming from an aspect that might be the cups in the tarot card it
might be the you know i wonder what would happen and i think there have been experiences of this and
perhaps some ancient cultures were mostly this uh in in a kind of opposition to ours if instead of the
chorus of the humans you had the chorus of our souls yeah right what would what would they sing
what would fill them with joy what would they inspire what would they catalyze what would they
want to well that's the secret court that's you know i mentioned leonard cohen's seminal song
that's the secret corn that david played and it pleads the lord right that and that's the thing is i
don't know if we're all you know we're always in an aspect like let's look at water like i mentioned
the cups in the tarot well water has all different aspects yeah sometimes it's flowing through as a
river other times it's steam other you know there's always different ways that water is coming around
there's always a different aspect of water and these are the aspects of the psyche and in and then that
chorus you're talking about okay the individuals are maybe in a great place singing at once but they're
giving a different aspect of the story than protagonist and antagonist and the god see then the
fourth place would be the gods there and the gods that are moving the situation along so um i think it's
real important um to see how full of we are yeah just to throw you in other words just to say in other
words to go at any given moment i am such a good boy with it i'm trying to relate but then i have to
pause and i have to let her knees in you know yes and that's where that space you know the word liminal
is everywhere now sure but as artists we know how to get out of our own way and that's when amazing
things happen and it's not just as artists even in our conversation today right we when when we get out
of our own way and then there's there's a there's an invitational space that draws mystery into uh
potential and then expression right and so this is why darren's not that interesting right yes of course
i'm darren yes of course i know i want darren things yes yes right right but it's not that interesting
what's interesting what's interesting strangely what's most interesting to me is something you sang
about which led to this conversation today you posted something wild paraphrase is i want other
brilliant passionate minds to be with to seek with to learn with to speak with to grow with together
right this was your prayer to the algorithm quote unquote right and and that you know i have there's
there's a i have a few people that i do this with regularly as i'm sure you have many and uh there's
a couple of groups that i do this with regularly and mostly we get out of our personal way and what
happens is absolutely incredible and unnexpectable right it's not something any of us could possibly have
predicted every time we get together and i think in the agora this is part of what was going on right
they weren't merely it wasn't they weren't just having arguments right about things they were
trying to get above the place where our human desires histories urges failings are become the gods
and crush the possibility and the mystery and the beauty and the divinity right they're trying to flip
that over right which is also what happens in the elifcinian mysteries i i've recently had the
incredible privilege to know maria margu she's a greek mystagogue she initiates people in the elifs
the mysteries of elifcina and what was to to hear her speak on this at great length which is profoundly
beautiful what's going on is this this process of sacrificing those human sort of animalistic if you
will drives and re-establishing uh what you're going to serve what are you going to serve right you're
going to serve those drives your whole life how can you do that as a culture and achieve anything
resembling virtue well i mean where is the you know as this was pointed out by robert bly and james
hillman years ago in the men's movement was that you know where's the initiation take place
yeah um in this culture you know um it certainly doesn't happen in junior high around the time that
most cultures do it you know you you're put into this madhouse this you know this that's exactly when
it's supposed to happen right you're supposed to yeah our young people grow up expecting in their
interiority right not necessarily in their consciousness they grow up expecting to be invited
into the efflorescence of their potential and what happens the army right well that's the corporation
well that's this culture that has a colonialist in you know empire is going to want to induce
young men to be reborn into the realm of aries uh mars you know we are rome you know in a particular
way like the greeks you know aries was a minor god he had his dalliances james hillman has a brilliant
right in a book that's very hard to read it should have been you know his only bestseller was the
soul's code but it should have been a terrible love of war because the love in there was aphrodite
and war was aries who are always locked in the lover's bed i just want to mention briefly
it just occurred to me that um that air that arisian uh uh initiation right the love of war it all
what our corporations are just that sublimated into a less directly violent form and the violence of
those gets um absorbed in the torment of living places nature ecologies the biosphere and so forth
right we just dump the damage into the silent living uh membrane around our world yeah which you know
maybe circa 1930 or earlier seemed infinite right you could just dump as much damage as you want and
it'll just keep absorbing it but certainly is no longer that way modernly yeah well at the i guess
we uh we are in runaway right now yeah you know when writing about addiction gregory bates and
systems theory guy i know him talks about that you know we're in the place an addict is in the place
where is the the the engineer's hand is on the governor's switch and it can't stop right actually
it just keeps pushing it harder yeah not just can't stop if it was on if we turn the dial to 10 yesterday
it'll be 100 tomorrow yeah we're on exponential runaway as far as that just not it's mirrored in
climate change you know it is mirrored by these exponential changes that are happening and so when
this happens when a system goes into runaway like a drunk the problem is is the trunk believes
he can control the bottle he i can control this one drink and he convinces himself of it this relates to
when you know wait let me just interrupt you that that the ass okay the thing that you're calling we
first of all doesn't exist that's the absence of we that's doing that and that
thing doesn't have feelings or emotions or thoughts or anything it's just driven like a process drives
itself it's not even a demon there's nothing we're like sorry to get so excited and enthusiastic i'll
lower my voice it's fine i mean that's to get you going it's like a train that the absence of a
conductor is what's driving the train right and that thing is insatiable it's like what you said
you quoted someone whose name i can't recall in one of your pieces i read parts of this morning who
said um you can never get enough of what you don't need to be happy eric off yeah yeah and and that's
what's conducting the train right it's like let's just invent new things that we can never get enough
of that we don't need to be human or intelligent or happy or alive or anything and that thing
it probably is the closest thing to something that actually resembles evil but it's not a presence
it's the abs it's the constant re-concentrating absence of good it's not even the shadow of the
hero right it's the absence of both those things well or it could be it could be seen that way it could
be seen to return to bates and as far as like this this this is relieved when the drunk decides
the bottle controls me i don't control the bottle there's no way my i i think you know what they call
it saying in recovery is 12 self-will run riot is the idea that i have an indomitable character that
can overcome this and let's see that whatever it is that that is driving the trunk that keeps convincing
and like you're right it's kind of a zombie consciousness it worked at one time and so now
in this time of zombie zombie capitalism so there's this problem which is the humans think that like
governments and corporations and things they treat them as if they're people right that they have
feelings or ideas or emotions or all of these things that humans have they got from one perspective
that i think is useful i'm not trying to say what they are but from a useful perspective there's
nothing in there it's just lethal processes driving themselves and i want to be really clear about one
other feature what those um motivating functions they despise life life is a threat to their continued
dominance and existence they despise intelligence they despise creativity they're like a tyrannical
psychotic that wants to evict anything that's a threat to it and what i mean by a threat to it is
a threat to its continued sovereignty over all phenomena it's going to eliminate you know
it's going to try to kill what it can't control is what's you know and so everything look at the
story of like a trickster myth that started we're going to look at giantism giant vehicles on the road
right giant mcmansions right i'm sitting in a house that next they're they're taking the the the brick
bow ranch houses down and putting up with mansions and blocking the sun for the people that are do not
want a mcmansion right and so we have a giantism in our culture so let's look at jack and the beanstalk
just for example like we look at this um this boy who's a fool and he gets he gets grifted by hermes
and so but within that story though there is a cow let's say it's a mother image that no longer gives
milk there is the land is it's a young pointed out for example the giant is eating everything in the
psyche so everything else the soul is starving so the land now is a is literally a wasteland and if
we take this out to our culture there is a giantism that is a like a corporation and it this giantism
that becomes a consciousness that is only there like the giant and jack and the beanstalk or these
stories it is only there to survive and to destroy what does not enhance its belief in
in its survival even though it's not even alive and so what what what happens when we are dehumanized
when we enter that realm it is stolen the the fleeting hours of our finite life to be in that
place and we experience a mortification now in jack and the beanstalk what happens what is seemingly
like for example um the the mythology of christ being born not in jerusalem not in a palace in rome
being in the sticks where he's not going to be looked for with as young points out there's animal
all around him you're not going to you know the ego is not going to look for this tiny thing like a
bean and jack the beanstalk it's not going to look for this in this fool boy but what happens as i alluded
to rilke and the sonnets this beanstalk which has roots in the ground and it goes up high and it
elevates and there is the golden goose there is redemption but it's being warded by this giant
the gold of the soul is not being used the giant doesn't know what to do with it
and then when the slaying of the giant happens this is where the land is restored and so if we find
ourselves now in this land of giant trucks and giant egos as our president and giantism everywhere this
bloated unfeeling place that creates alienation creates dehumanization i think that the crucial
work of the soul now and this is what my daemon tells me i have to do is i do have to speak about
these places and hence that that um prayer to the algorithms that that you quoted and you know i
think as much as we can share these kinds of things and get it out there and you know you share to me
and you bring me people and i bring you people yes and then when then we begin to have this dialogue
um you know that increases you know that that increases rather than diminishes
um also you know um so it's one other thing right those young people that are seeking initiation
and they get served something toxic and dead inside instead they are very interested in us older
people and our ways of learning and seeing and growing together right like that that knight right
he's retired and he's you know i can't i can't ride the horse anymore you know i can't go for the
grail i'm gonna have to leave that to future generations there's knocks on the door you know
i have out what i would think of as allo children and these are people you know in like their early
20s and stuff and we just have a blast together and we learn and we grow and you know you i've i've
watched you it's so funny that this is our first conversation because i've been watching you for like
15 years right and you're an alchemist man you're making that medicine that nectar
of insight and something far more deeply resembling truth than what is usually on offer you're doing
that just naturally all day long you're passionate about it that reaches into people's wife wants me
to do the dishes more but wait say that again my wife wants me to do the dishes more yeah well you
do some yard work while i'm not going to argue with her you should probably do some dishes yeah i do i
mean okay good well it's it's then she finds it's something else i've missed but you know so it's
like yeah what we're talking about is important i'm just making light of it because i but see that's the
thing is i remember like these experiences like you said you got an intuitive idea when you were young
that adults were speaking something that was missing the point of all things you know i remember like
driving in birmingham where i was born with my mother and walking and seeing the poor neighborhoods
and she said i cried they called me the judge because i look at everything and i was moved to
weeping by poverty see that's the chorus that's what i'm talking about right there that's the chorus of
our souls that recognizes this should never be there's no reason for this to be this way this is
fundamentally wrong we we have to become something better than this together today even if it's these
adults who didn't know like even if it's only in our hearts you know for me one of the things there
were two things where i grew up during the vietnam war and i saw them on television all the time and i was just
like yeah what what you know um but the other thing was humans seemed to think that insects were bad
and should mostly just be disposed of right and the insects were my companions i adored them right they
were like gods or angels to me as a young child i was absolutely enthralled with the existence of all of
the tiny life of earth yeah so when the adults were like yeah you just kill that stuff up yeah i i knew
like something's gone wrong in my people right like guys oh yeah you have those early communal
experiences like um and you see that there there's an inside i mean i remember having this terrifying
experience talk about terror and beauty walking through terminus station in birmingham alabama with my
parents of about three and a half four years old and um seeing a mr t a life-size mr peanut statue and
this was some insect alien god to me of terror and running away from it and dropping down there you
could as you ran you saw mica i thought the micro were stars and it was god behind it and praying that
it would save me from this thing and so that you know the world is alive these insects are alive and
talking about the like what you said your experiences came to mind about in our apartment complex in
birmingham there were lots of nice old southern racist ladies and they were saying things that were
utterly out of their minds and noxious like well that martin luther king's gonna come to town and
all he does is you know stir up them bucks and you know those bucks they just want white ladies and you
know god's against that because uh you know you don't see no dog and cat mating do you that's why
the racist should say and i'm going late i'm three and a half four five years old i go lady those are
different species and thank you for the sugar cookie but they're pushing me out the door you know okay
well i i know your mother's jewish and you think you're smarter than everybody else and so it's right
right you know this this whole this i almost said aspect again that aspect of life where you as a
child know you you know as a child something is intuitively wrong i grew up watching the vietnam war
too and experiencing a mortification and that's why like i said even when you saw the way hippies were
being mocked on the television at the time where they never got beatniks which beatnik isn't even a word
they you know a beat ever uttered it was like a journalist in san francisco i believe jack kerouac
is so out in space he's like sputnik he's a beatnik right that's where the word beaten it came from
wow you know so the aspect of where the beats how they were noxiously limbed how the hippies were
noxious you know that's what most people knew i remember sitting around with people that never
watched anything from television and when you talk to them about the 60s they talk about talk about that
time i dream of genie and the hippies came in right you know that was what it was to them not this
organic and you talk about the um compensation for the corporate culture for the war machine culture
or you know this all of a sudden what came about and there was a problem with the flower people
because the flower people you know are going to be a little bit green um as robert you know
um um robert bligh talking about um the beatles for example you know john lennon staying in the
bathroom because of his mother was dead right so the flowers came up from the earth and as the men's
movement came about okay how are men that they came up like this how are we going to live in the world
we're going to be we're going to be green what is going to be our grail and that's the other aspect
that's the compensation coming up but the compensation was necessary in the 60s you know
we needed the white goddess to rise and inspire the beatles because what we were getting was the war
machine in this hyper masculine culture of me my father was in the airborne you know and he he walked
around like he thought it was kurt douglas he would explode and raise like the men of those times you
know it's you know kirk would just explode you know and it was like that those were those were the men we
were confronted with this very volatile you know war was the answer and even though my father was cool
um he still had that aspect and so all these really nice people now that are afraid of the patriarchy
they're an overcompensation for these out of hand over and so this is where the alchemy comes together
this is where you know you were talking about reaching out to young people they need to be taught
my generation needs to be taught to be a little nicer you know huxley at the end of his life are
going you know what's the answer is he's giving his college lectures and he's saying just try to be a
little nicer to each other well this prophecy came too true with a lot of young people yeah right ultra nice
and they need a little bit of that you know need a little bit of burris crustiness you know they need a
little bit more of that kirk douglas in them to confront power and as i wrote about the article
i put up on substact today um was that in that the in the idea of we where how do we convince
you're not going to be able to convince unreasonable power you're not going to be able to go into the
corporate board that's the wrong that's the wrong strategy generally speaking right they're not going to
right they're not going to respond to logic no we can have all these well-reasoned art you know
well-reasoned arguments about what they're doing is bad for the earth and even bad for themselves
but at the same time what is going to be that orphic influence that begins to make the transformation
and once again i think this is where the hippies were right it's going to come out and in some way we
have to reinvent culture and practically the last thing that i heard james hillman say um at his 80th
birthday celebration in pittsburgh um as at the formal talks ended um he said keep the conversation
going yeah you know that's what you know later than he read um william butler yates is um sailing the
byzantium because he was 80 you know there's no country for old men but the last thing he said in
the formal talk was um you know we we have to have a dialogue about this and somehow we have to keep
you know there's a romantic place where there is an insularity and and there is where the
transformation is happening but at some point though after the process of the blackening is happening
then the opening up and bringing in um younger people you know the great my favorite movie critic
the best movie critic that ever wrote and entertaining was pauline kale in the new yorker
and she wouldn't go to the movie with geezers like me i have my fixed opinion about what they would be
she would you know see the right young people who are writing in the village voice and she you know
the younger people and she'd invite them and that's who she'd go to the movie because afterwards she could
have coffee with them and have a discussion with people without ossified opinions yeah right yeah yeah you
don't you don't want to um ply ply around with fossils there's a couple of things though that that i
think are important you know we've been inculcated with this idea that you got to fight the things
that are wrong i think that rarely works out well most of the things that are problematical
are highly structured profoundly historically momentous right they have this incredible momentum behind
them and um if you if you go at them face on bad things are likely to happen or just failure well
that's a that's a point where things you're going to have to have the red army face the nazis right
you know okay that that extremist has happened where this juggernaut of nazism has happened but
that's the extremist of life thank god on most days we're not faced with that and that's why we're
unprepared to deal with climate change you know because on most days blissfully little has happened i have
a poem you know and it's talking and everything in the poem like an old sofa is yearning to be a
luxury bed in a luxury hotel and the luxury hotel is yearning to be a flop house with a poet
you know that's writing unpublishable verse and you know and everything in it is transforming when it
gets to the point where um you know there's an there there's an aspect of an individual that it's
longing to it's longing to be a garment on a prostitute that's given to her that gives it to a soldier that
goes to a war and dies and the war is longing to be a quiet evening at home and so you know there's
this there's there's this always this longing and this is where it's really important to say you know
sometimes we fight the power sometimes we yield sometimes we're like bruce lee bruce lee we're like
water but what type of water right yeah sometimes we're like fire yeah oh i agree right no it's it's as
as if there there certainly isn't one answer but one of the things that i've come to understand in
my own concerns about our situation and and um possibilities for transformation is that uh talking
to people rarely does much good what humans seem to respond to a need and what actually creates change
is giving people something to do someone to be something to become and this is what has been largely
captured by our toxic culture and the other toxic cultures of modernity it's it they've got a sort
of stranglehold on role and humans ache for meaningful roles if you can give them even in a even in a
playful way an experiment an adventure something to become together this tends to work very quickly i suspect
that one of the keys to the problems we face is to reverse that empty we right that we keep using
right well we we can't and we're not going to be able to do anything about climate change we can't
stop nuclear there's no we there yet what if we we if i'd so that there was something that you know an
anti-nut movement that trump and others have reversed you know the democrats starting a war in ukraine
there's a way there was a we at one time that did have an effective anti-nuclear movement you know
caused ronald reagan to go to reikovic and there are so there either are yeah i would say yeah there
were organs of a we yeah there were organs of we and there's the thing about one caveat conversation
i'm not talking about debate i mean though we we can't have a debate debate in agora conversation is eros
oh agreed eros is entering the psyche like the story i told yes and so you're having this dance
between eros and psyche in good conversations yes i am you know that's why i'm saying keep the
conversation going and let's make and this is not to intimidate people they don't have to make their
conversation art let's just try our best to make them artful in other words you know and you just and
the way you do that and i i think the word authentic is overused you know it it's it's overused by people
that are purists but what i mean when i'm going to use the word authentic is i used the word damon before
that what you know is the force of character of where you've done the soul work and you're allowing
yourself to speak from the polis of yourself yes you you were you know there is the chorus too yeah
the chorus and all those other kinds of things you're listening to yourself and you're listening
to the other people and then you know whatever the the forces are gathering around and that they are
giving i i know when i've collaborated with people all of a sudden i'm speaking lines
and though i don't know where those lines are coming from but they're best lines in the poem or
the comedy routine and that can only happen by the experience of you know the music is playing and
there are other people dancing and you join in yes yes so this is i just want to say so the there's
this thing we can do together where we establish a third mind right it's not my mind it's not your mind
right it's it's this space that we um fertilize and rise up into out of ourselves and uh yeah you
know one of the quantum physics i've read i can't remember which one it was and it talks about a group
of people that set out to create a conscious entity and that creature like a poltergeist and i believe
its name was philip um came about and philip actually existed with this group of people um
that that they had created an entity that communicated to them see this is part of what i'm trying to get
at when i say whatever we are i think the smallest part of what we are is human and even even in our
humanity even in that the part that we inhabit is like about this much of it right it's like the tip of
the pinky of an entire organism and we're mostly trapped in there we have no idea what we are
because we don't live most of us and we don't adventure into and create and invent together the
context in which we could understand what it means you use the word pinky and then earlier we were
talking about the hand you were yes i was on purpose yeah yeah so so the hand extends and then what is
that hand and i think that i think that there is a very strong part of and you were mentioning this
before very strong part of whatever this ecosystem of souls is whatever it is it wants us to have a
human experience yes yes i agree very crucial part in some small way the same way a liver has its
function the same yes absolutely and it's it's divine and inspired it's not merely uh you know pragmatic
right no yes it's not pragmatic i think it's there too you know i remember terence mckenna speaking
of the fabergé eggs um of the making of the fabergé eggs by the machine elves and he was saying when
he finally was able to construct one this joy went out through the universe right they this excitement
happened when he made his own little version of those cosmic fabergé eggs and you know in pan's
labyrinth when the when the young girl sacrifices herself for the greater good this applause goes
out among among the heavens you know there is this and i've had dreams of those arenas where there are
these watchers that that are there and when we when we make something like what happened with mckenna
this effect there it makes them happy and it is not like you said it's not crackpot crackpot realism
there is they're doing it because joy is their nutrition you know i'm not not here for darren
but i'm mostly here for other beings yeah right and so just recognizing that by itself is both humbling
and profoundly empowering because it invites the chorus and the polis and the protagonist and the
antagonist and the audience you know and the jury and whatever right it invites all of that into uh
expressivity and potential in the conversation in my relationships and in acts of both uh creative
wonder or play but also like things that are intrinsically heroic rescue love adoration care
um helping a being who like like uh when psyche rescued the ant king right or pulled the small
thing that we ignore yeah yeah right the small ego doesn't want to recognize because i got an agenda
right now and i'm feeling sorry for myself because i'm no longer beautiful and i've got to go get my
husband back but she takes the time to hear this king of the ants and rescues it and that's transforming
transforming her identity the meaning of the earth the meaning of the sky right this kind of act
it changes what everything is it's ontologically transformative it magic it it these sorts of acts
of the great beauty of the heart and of the the sort of the course of our of the souls they change
what reality means yeah and that might still look it might still look the same as it did a moment ago
but it is no longer that way yeah well yes we're seeing new eyes you know we we're coming upon a
reality that is you know more of a trans it's more of this transmogrifying landscape that we're trying
to make sense of um by by seeing particulars and i think analogous to you know what we think is our
individuality cellular structure right we that you know this this cell all of a sudden this describing
itself as an individual well it is an individual cell but it's working within this corpus and then
we even get into what the microtubules are up to right you know that they seem to be that function
you're talking about that you know that the microtubules are you know just devouring their amino acids and
having something to do with consciousness that we don't understand you know i love um
i love penrose's take on this it's much more sophisticated than it appears superficially
i've paid close attention to his work you know we should probably wrap up fairly soon but i have
a couple more things i'd like to chase with you if you've got a few more minutes
one of them is um how did you come on to the work of pasulka was it through uh oh gosh what's his
name you mentioned him earlier at rice university jeffrey kripal yeah was it through him or or how
did you come across her just one of those serendipities you know somebody um you know a lot of
algorithms can actually help with that right sure and you just you're coming about and maybe
something catches your eye like i'm just trying to do some research about what my son and i saw so
i'm um i'm you know looking at the but i'm going online i'm searching for jacques jacques belay
and you know so jacques belay's um experience with you when you have high strangers like that
and then you'll just see you know i emphasis her mentioned and i'm going to go see who this is
okay slow down just slow down for a moment i want to i want to direct you a little bit if you'll
allow me um so first of all like i have some connections with this whole thing right i i know
i know valet i've i've read pasulka um we got we got christmas cards from valet here last year and
stuff right he lives here in san francisco and i've followed his work for many years and i've been
interested in uh ufos since i was a child i probably you know read um uh chariots of the
gods when i was like seven or whatever what did you and your son see what happened tell me the story
okay well yeah i think uh we're crossing the street not too busy you know it's in there oh oh that story
that story of you know i had and so you know we're crossing the street and that um high strangeness
happened about what that vehicle was where obviously was not operating by the laws of
physics it had no tires there was no propulsion device it we both saw it disappear into thin air
um we we felt its presence behind us both of us there was something there he saw something a slight
variation of what i saw so you know what popped out of a dimension you know out of a portal like my son
has been forced fascinated with portals since i used to tell him you know he's four or five years old i
would tell him stories and i always had to have a portal to another dimension right right so so there
was you know so whatever it was um whatever that was that came and went for whatever reason of its
own um i think that's when i went and i said okay what does valet say about this and you know what and
so i started investigating you know his concept of high strangeness and that probably i can't remember
exactly led to the writing of diane which when i came across her books i said okay i know i want to
book to my wife what a couple books i want for christmas right so you know i ordered her books
and so it was um you know that as and and so i found that extreme i found it riveting um that you
have experiences in your life and sometimes they can come about through an elephant dream you know or
sometimes they can come upon a visionary experience um that that you know cripples flip happens
mm-hmm and so i mean other things happen sorry you know like i can tell you experience of how i came
across james hillman of two books came into my hand i was going to get i was giving a talk on hermes
and um i saw a book you know it was in the passage of hermes where um key where hermes is helping odysseus
with the problem of cersei so i just came across a book that said hermes and synchronicity and i'm
pulling it from the shelf and another book called loose ends falls into literally falls into my hands
and i said okay look at the second i open up the book about hermes and synchronicities and it's
talking about something called library angels that show up at a crucial time the book right
book ends up in your hands and behind me these two women i overhear them talking one of them saying
you know she's saying up the street at the far road library yesterday i was looking for this story
that you told me about by oscar wilde and i couldn't find anywhere it wasn't on the shelf in
the wild section where his other books were but then this i see somebody get up and they just leave
a book and they walk abruptly out of the library and i have to check i go over checking the book and
it's the oscar wilde book in the story you were telling me about and i'm overhearing this these women
say that and i'm going look um library angels you saw a library and they're backing away from me
slowly because it was not their experience to hear that tale but it was so but and then i opened up
the book and it was when my first marriage ended and there had been a betrayal involved and there
was betrayal in this group of the odyssey there were betrayals happening in it and this whole thing
was living out and james hillman's essay in loose ends about odysseus and the coming to manhood by
betrayal is and and i actually said to him and i he said he i said okay he goes i know what story
you're going to tell me when i was speaking to him he said i know it's this thing from loose ends he
said that sort of came out of me in a period of material when i was a very young man it just sort
of showed up and i wrote it practically overnight so it was like in the story and like okay the opening
of the story would sound anti-semitic but as i said i'm half jewish so um so half of my my mother's
people would be so it starts out with a jewish father and he sets his son on a mantle and he says
son jump to me and the boy jumps and the father moves out of the way and the kid flatters on the
ground and cries and and the father says let that be a lesson to you never trust a jew or a father and so
so so kilman gets into explaining himself about this okay um he says that when we men reach a
certain age and this has to be with the initiation work he later did with robert bligh eden is mom
it's the garden it you know like your mother's breast or the food mom brings to you
and you know is going to show up there on your tray and but then you know
god shows up everyone and eden ends you know in other words in psychology the mother
is the image and then with the greeks you go out to zeus and zeus is the cosmos
and he contains all the other gods so he so human was saying in these initiation books he was writing
and working with bligh about it and having these men's meetings that where in our culture the men that
came of age in the 60s were um not having this initiation period so betrayal is the wound the
wound of odysseus odysseus he compares in the essay um the caledonian boar that kills adonis
adonis lives with mom um aphrodite she buries him half the year and he spends it with persephone so
but he is killed by the caledonian boar that's what kills adonis but odysseus also has this wound in
the same place and that is which when he's washed up on ithaca that's what's recognized by his nurse
is that he is the returned king because he lived through that wounding which is the leaving of the
edenic realm but what odysseus needed though was all these shipwrecks to kind of have confrontation with
goddesses because he was a greek patriarch and he was so wily he couldn't be taught but till he was
set down and made miserable and lost everything he was still not quite a man and so it's the betrayals
that hillman is saying that when you live that you want unconditional love but when you realize love
is conditional real love breaks out and it's the same thing that happened to psyche when she fell to earth
it's part of the process of maturation even though that word is um value laden in ways that i don't
mean uh i mean like um developmental efflorescence right and the phases of that efflorescence well
hillary calls it to stay try to stay in naivety and this culture has it with this obsession of the
innocence and he calls that toxic innocence right but there is an aspect of innocence to return to in the
blakey incense that's completely you know there's different from toxic innocence that this rebirth
of wonder as ferling guenny put it i am looking for the rebirth of wonder in his coney island of the
mind that there is that that is blakey and innocence you know blake was a major influence on the beat
writers but the toxic innocence of where let's say i'm walking down the street and i'm staying at my
sister's house when we first came to america and this this very you know nice but insane bourgeois
woman is talking to me and she's going in that house there's a pedophile and it's this abandoned
house and there's nobody living there so i asked my sister about it later and it turns out there was
this law this old man he was lost and he asked a cop who was an undercover cop for directions and they
were doing a dragnet for prostitutes for men for jobs so he gets on these lists that these moms see
on computers and they have this you know they have the hysteria of hestia about protection but and so
that's toxic innocence you know that the idea that that we blindly you know kesti is in her house and
every time prior papus who's a funny little god who's a god to sense of humus he's mostly phallus
if you're still in italy you see these valley and you see these little statues these huge phalluses in
the yard well that's prior papus he is the crude joke he but every time he tries to enter the house
donkey braids and hestia passes out so it's this so where where this comes into in this vast dialogue of
things of what hillman's getting at is when innocence is lost um the soul making starts to
show up because if you're in eden you are locked in childhood and in some ways our culture is very
emotionally arrested that way um that that the woundings don't happen in life and i'm not saying
sadomasochism i'm not talking about hurting people for the sake of hurting people i'm talking about the
soul making that yates is talking about you know by seeing the terrible beauty of the world that's
going to create a wound in you you know when i'm having these wounding experiences i'm walking home
in alabama and i'm jumped by rednecks right that is you know which actually would happen right a
jewish boy walking home and there's a wounding that happened to me there or where the teacher
sends me into the little girl out of the room and you know she that was the day they talked about um
that aspect of the new testament i believe it's in matthew where the jew killers killed our lord
right and i'm jumped on the playground there's an aspect of where i'm learning a little bit more about
what's out there and you know later after my hippie you know my hippie days and all of that i'm in high
school and getting jumped again and i got take karate and i get a black belt and that's an initiation
into another life but it's a little bit limited there's just way too much aries and you know a
lot of men in there that are gay and they're hiding it by hypermachoism but they're not going to come to
the you know they're not going to come into an awareness of bracing the spartan aspect of being gay
they are going to keep saying you know making these weird projections the kicking and punching and
gay and doing this life is going to drive the gay out of them so and then i just have to go into the
initiation of i'm walking around my neighborhood with a ukulele and i want some money and i'm saying
i'm chanting my poems you know because if you're walking around with you know with a musical instrument
you're not panhandling and if you're being yourself and saying funny and speaking poetry p i'm going to say
yeah i'm going to give you a poem for a quarter and you know i have enough for lunch at the local
zestos right so so there's an aspect of how these woundings you know the madness that i could not
live an ordinary life um that wounding of the way i'm humiliated when i try to do something that you
know like it's when i'm trying to have a normal ordinary life working it's like those scenes and i love
lucy where she's in the chocolate factory you know there's just you know something goes askew
to take me back so i'm a troubadour on the streets you know that's the way it's going to work out and
a way those are the woundings i'm talking about the humiliations that happen that when you're not
living the life you're supposed to live and the world wounds you so the wound can become a wound
and in that process is that's the wounding that hillman's talking about when you lose your innocence
beautiful
well this is when greeks say that silence happens that's when hermes enters
when there's a conversation going so that everything is quiet
you know sometimes we have to make space yeah for that phil i'm so grateful to have this time with
you right now i hope we may have future conversations if you're open to that i would very much we should
carve a group of people like this group you're connected with and we should and that way we can
enrich and large deepen and expand ourself go outward and upward and down at the same time
yes yes we have um there's actually a couple of groups uh i've just started a new one but we have
this thing called the organon which is going on on saturdays around uh 12 pm pst so that would be like
4 pm your time um and i'll send you an invitation but i would love to have a further conversation where
we can explore some other features of our history thought creativity and so forth um just together if
you're open to that sure yeah all in any of those yes excellent all right um thank you my friend
fabulous to spend this time with you today i'm just so i'm so happy and grateful that we
could explore together and perhaps experience a kind of uh anamnesis if i may use the greek word
for now more soon
you
you
