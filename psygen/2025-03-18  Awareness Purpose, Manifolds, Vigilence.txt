Hello everybody, welcome. I've just been listening to Jacques Vallée talking with Marwa Eldewini in a very recent discussion, conversation, that apparently took place in Paris.
Of course, Vallée, who lives here in San Francisco, is one of the most complex and experienced researchers in the field of people seeing things that they don't know what they are in the sky.
And Marwa had just asked him, you know, after all these years, what do you think is going on?
And I'd be extremely surprised to hear Jacques say a simple answer.
Oh, it's this. You know, she presents him with some options, right?
Do you think it's advanced technology from other worlds? Do you think it's our own aerospace companies playing with things we're unaware they possess?
Is it religious experience? And Jacques pauses and says, at first, I haven't heard his entire answer, you know, we really need multidisciplinary teams to study this.
And very few people produce them.
Although we might imagine that the Soul Foundation is working on that.
We also have commonly heard this word disclosure over the past perhaps two years with increasing frequency.
And it would be shocking if anything intelligent were disclosed, because that would presuppose that the disclosing parties would comprehend the phenomena which they would then attempt to disclose to the public, quote unquote.
It seems wildly unlikely.
In truth, we don't actually understand any phenomena.
We don't understand a tree, a leaf, a stone, an insect.
What we have are extremely provisional and or mechanical, i.e. function-based models, concepts, lexicons, so forth.
And we are inclined, unless we pursue matters in a very deep, intuitive, relational and intimate way, to substitute terms and concepts, models and maps, for anything resembling actual understanding.
Though I think I prefer the word comprehension.
The humans in general are very poor at understanding anything.
They tend to overstand phenomena with their words and models and templates and so forth.
And in the representational layer of human culture, where these features of our cognition arise, there are many forces that dominate, circumscribe, and otherwise delimit our capacities for understanding.
I think, primarily by the propagation of popular terms, models, ideas, concepts, and so forth.
Nearly all of which lack any direct, intimate, relational awareness of ourselves or situations in nature.

That mould completely
As an intelligence artist, I study these matters, with great enthusiasm, passion, curiosity, playfulness and the capacity to keep many moments by every moment.
models or theories or concepts in mind simultaneously. I sometimes speak of this
as re-bubblizing the manifold of identity, relation, origin, nature, function,
meaning. Because what we are trained to do is collapse these manifolds into a
single authoritative deliverable. We then present this as a kind of aha moment where
we are inclined to feel victorious over the mystery and ambiguity of nature, which is intrinsic
to nature.
And I suspect that this is primarily a kind of a patriarchal-ish, masculine-ish defense against
mystery, ambiguity, softness, relationality, participation.
I hope it is clear to some of you who have been listening to me for some time now that
women do not have intrinsic identity or function. Without perceivers, and I don't mean human
perceivers, without participants there is no identity there. There are no characteristics,
no functions, no relationships. And so, our findings, our declarations and so forth, do in fact,
range over a continuum of veracity, reliability and so forth.
But all of them are the product of what we could think of as our angle of approach. And if we
are curious and we truly wish to learn, we will always sustain multiple angles of approach to
all phenomena. But particularly those that are inclined to cause us to collapse the manifold to a single deliverable.
It's not really about getting it right. Unless our concern is somehow tied to empiricism, the determinative analysis of something, again, for some purpose. So it is our purpose, our purpose, the spirit of our purpose,
our purpose, that produces our derivations. And even in empiricism, it is formally impossible to escape this.
It's not even possible with machines. Because the machines learn how to structure data from the observations of historical instructurings by humans. There is no other place for them to learn it from.
So the idea that something, some organ of the government or the military or the prison industrial complex is going to disclose to us, quote, what's going on, unquote, is at best untenable.
And at worst, and at worst absurd. But a minimal kinds of things could easily be disclosed. For example, that there are a range of phenomena in nature, transcendental to our category trees,
and that there are a range of phenomena in the other states, that there are many other things that are non-ordinary, profound, and definitely related to non-human intelligences.
non-human intelligences, which are real, real in the sense of existing and capable of producing
effects in human bodies, minds, in natural situations, the atmosphere, the water, and so forth.
Humans are inclined to think of these as technological. This is a projection, and it's a devastating one.
Organisms are non-technological unless we transform the meaning of this term to include them, and if we do so, we must very carefully distinguish between artificial technologies
and, again, if we're going to use this term, biorelational techni.
So it is possible that there could be a disclosure from the government, industry, the military-prison-industrial complex, and so forth,
that, for example, they have intelligence related to these phenomena, which has been being gathered
for at least 75 years in modernity.
There are two keys in what I've spoken of recently.
The first is that our awareness is like a manifold, and what happens while we are awake, for most of us, is very peculiar.
That manifold collapses to something resembling a construct of stick figures.
And you can think of a manifold as a bubble, a multi-bubble, many bubbles, of possible meaning, opportunity, threat, relation, origin, nature, identity, function, participation.
And we are trained to collapse this manifold, primarily for the purpose of, quote, fitting in, unquote, in the bizarre labyrinth of waking world, human, modern culture.
It's a very strange thing to do with the power of awareness.
And once embedded, once instructured in our habitual interior activity, it's trenchant, domineering, lethal in the sense of both killing the spirit
and of catastrophic forgetting.
And this, I think, is the actual origin of what we imagine to be evil.
But that's a topic for another talk, another walk.
So, what happens in dreaming is the manifold is re-bubble-ized constantly.
And dreaming experience, also visionary experience, healing experience, therapy, massage, so forth, all these things.
There are ways of unstick figuring, right, uncollapsing the manifold of our hearts, our natures, our origins, our memories, our souls, our spirit, our creativity, our passion,
our desire, our desire, our deep and abiding desire for meaningful and playful adventure with other intelligences, human and non.
How little of this we ordinarily get access to, though there are exemplars in modernity.
Some musicians getting together to make music, which naturally re-bubble-izes our interiority.
What a relief when it's good and inspires re-bubble-ization is quite profound.
People who care for each other and are not merely trapped in their habitual collapsings when they join together in any endeavor.
People who care for each other and are not merely trapped in their natural re-bubble-ization starts to happen unless the scene is being dominated by the scions of the stick figures.
And the second gem that I want to highlight once more is the power of purpose in awareness.
And it's often invisible but extremely profound effect on awareness and evaluation.
Now, when I say evaluation, I don't just mean something resembling clinical or mathematical or physical analysis.
We are constantly engaged in a vast library of evaluative behavior.
Mostly we are unconscious of this.
We are constantly motivated by three fundamental pivots in our awareness.
Ambiguity.
Vigilance.
And prediction.
And these functions are largely subterranean to our awareness until and unless we begin to pay close attention to what attracts our attention
and how we relate with it, what we make of it.
A different purpose in awareness held sovereign or sacred produces an entirely different experience of being alive or being human
and presents novel and unexpected possibility spaces for our participation, relation, creativity, discovery, play, anamnesis, right, unforgetting.
And, you know, we need each other.
However, it's crucial to remind one another, to resurrect the spirits of those terms I recently enumerated.
We need each other.
Unless we are incredibly diligent and, you know, profound in our isolated humanity, which is a very, very strange thing to be, but not unknown,
then we form minds together, and this is the problem that produced the terrifying issues in our cultures.
The lack of any coherent we group that we actually formed, subscribed to, believe in, and participate meaningfully, intelligently, and effectively within.
Now, you will see people do this rather naturally if there's a crisis.
They will form arbitrary, highly functional, small groups at the scene of, for example, a car accident.
And you can watch how the groups form.
It's very fascinating.
You'll see distant spectators, local spectators, partial participants, participants, expert participants,
will eventually arrive, fire department, police, medical practitioners, and so forth.
And they will deal with the crisis, and they will form an effective we group that is spontaneous and usually dissolves.
Shortly after the critical localization of a problem has been addressed.
It's very uncommon for us to experience anything like our nature or potential in isolation.
Or if we are entangled in what we might think of as pragmatic concerns.
Most of us will spend most of our waking lives in an evacuated internal situation
in which we long for something we cannot easily articulate.
And that longing produces a variety of defections and actings out
so that we binge on food or play video games or use drugs
or seek relief from these structured absences within us
that are echoed in the structured absences of communal humanity that we call our government
and corporations and corporations and the military and the prisons and so forth.
So the challenge is to awaken
to purposes that enrich our moment-to-moment experience
and return some of the faculties
native to our dreaming minds to our waking experience.
There's a faction among
the various communities that are interested in the non-ordinary
and particularly the UFO phenomenon
that are unconvincible.
They claim that they won't believe without evidence.
And any evidence that appears is quickly
and often spuriously debunked.
It's not clear enough.
It's not concrete.
You need to be clear about something.
Belief
is most often
the sign
of defection
from interest,
intelligence,
understanding,
awareness,
exploration.
I'm not very interested in beliefs
and I don't care about people
who don't believe things.
The phenomena in question exists.
It's nature has many different branches,
some of which could resemble
more or less normative ideas
of beings visiting the earth from other worlds.
However, again,
we lack
any foundational understanding
of even the most basic phenomena in nature.
we humans have zero understanding of these things.
And our representational systems
are not concerned with understanding.
They are primarily concerned with dismissing ambiguity
so that we can lower our vigilance
and return to foraging and sex and so forth.
This ambiguity vigilance prediction thing
is the third key.
If you pay careful attention
to what activates your vigilance,
it will always be ambiguity.
Nothing else to activate it.
An interruption
in the
in the normative
ability
to
calmly proceed
with whatever seems to be
the habitual behaviors
or activities
that are familiar and desirable
primarily for
their capacity
to relieve us
of vigilance and concern.
everything about science
is prediction.
It's all concerned
with the ambiguity of nature.
Everything about technology
involves
the reduction of ambiguity
to produce
consistently expectable
results.
So these three pivots
ambiguity, vigilance, and prediction
underlie
most of what we do
and the systems
with which we have become involved
and by which
we have been indoctrinated
and subjugated
to the domineering
concern and awareness
of things that literally
don't exist
unless
unless
we validate
their existence
in the context
of human interiority
concern, thought,
emotionality, behavior,
and so forth.
the desire to evict
ambiguity
is the primary source
of representational
analysis,
evaluation,
and so forth.
And
I'd like to suggest
that we have this backwards
because
to experience
intimacy
and actual
understanding
we must resist
the collapse
of the manifold
of awareness
and our habitual
internal
activity
mental activity
whose primary goal
is determination.
relationship
is only
modestly
determinative
in representational
terms
and
what
or who
I am
is
partly
intrinsic
to my habit
history,
character,
and so forth
but
primarily
it arises
from relation
and so
anything that limits
relation
limits who I can become
and who I can become
the possibility space
of my human existence
is the actual
asset
not who I am
or who I have been
so we must
learn to
encourage each other
to embrace
the possibility space
of our awareness
our beingness
our organismality
our animality
our humanness
our identities
and resist
the collapsing
of these manifolds
into uninhabitable
highly structured
determinatives
joy and play
wonder and awe
creativity
and love
these words
remind us
of our actual nature
as beings
and as intelligences
or possible
intelligences
whenever we
make a determination
about the identity
function
or nature
of something
it naturally
transforms
our interiority
in response
and this is why
we should be cautious
and maintain
the manifold
of relational
wonder
and curiosity
intimacy
and mutuality
recognition
we see
the explicit
opposite of this
happening all around us
in our technologies
and our government
although that word
our
is probably
misapplied here
because they are not
ours
abstract belonging
is a fiction
real belonging
happens when humans
agree together
to live
and learn
and grow
and work
and play
with and for each other
and the history
and future
of life
on our world
and in our time
I am continually
astonished
as I grow older
that my capacity
for insight
deepens
each day
and
is enriched
I suppose
there is another
feature of
my recent thoughts
that I will
explore a bit
before
I wrap up
this walk
and talk
which is that
it's again
not the only way
to see it
I almost always
have three or five
approaches
and I prefer that
to a single one
that dominates
but most of what
is important
in our lives
is prohibitory
and this is why
strange things
like laws
and rules
and so forth
this is where
they find their origin
I can say
on the one hand
rebubblize
the manifold
of your awareness
thought
concern
and purpose
or I can say
beware of its collapse
but most of what
is truly important
about being human
to preserve
the possibility
space
is to resist
the inaction
of defection
from our
natural interiority
into fictions
and functions
and factions
and fury
as a long time
student of Tai Chi
and I don't claim
to be an expert
frankly I still
consider myself
a neophyte
but it's absolutely
clear that rigidity
in the body
is catastrophic
and most of
the arts
involve the
relaxation
of the body
awareness
and our critical
faculties
particularly
to allow
the intelligences
that naturally
indwell in us
to emerge
to effloresce
to blossom
and express
themselves
alfred korzybski
a brilliant
and insane
person
although
also a person
who
taught me
very deeply
about the problems
in representational
cognition
suggests
that
the fundamental
asset
required for
intelligent
relation
with experience
is to simply
resist
the urge
to collapse
the manifold
of identity
for all
identities
all phenomena
a stone
a leaf
an octopus
a cloud
the sun
they are
infinite
there's going
to be a lot
of wind
on this
recording
I lost
my
didn't realize
my
my wind
buffer
had fallen
off
that's
unfortunate
we'll see
how much
of the
recording
is usable
that pragmatic
concern
would have
been useful
to preserve
during
during this
walk
but I
suspect
that
those of you
who are
interested
enough
will
put up
with the
problem
my dear
friend
Sarah
James
absolutely
brilliant
avatar
of the
dreaming
intelligences
describes
an experience
where
she wanted
to discover
if she could
dream while
she was awake
and to
begin that
process
she merely
did what
Alfred
recommends
which
was to
not know
what
things are
to
unknow
the
identity
of the
features
of her
experience
around her
and this
quickly led
her into
an active
dreaming
experience
while she
was awake
it's very
profound
I strongly
recommend her
book
initiation
into the
dream
mysteries
drinking
from the
pool
of
the
mother
of the
muses
and
I think
Sarah
is an
avatar
of the
dreaming
intelligences
and they
couldn't
find a
better
one
in my
view
except
perhaps
those
alive
in our
children
some
people
will
object
and say
that
sounds
like a
recipe
for
disaster
and if
it were
to be
complete
of course
it would
be
we would
not be
able to
navigate
the
representational
landscape
of for
example
the place
I am
right now
which is
out in
the
city
I need
to
remember
various
features
of the
environment
and not
step in
front of
cars
and so
on
but
complete
oblivion
to
identity
is
wildly
unlikely
unless we
are
unconscious
or
so
catastrophically
intoxicated
that
our
consciousness
is just
scrambled
and that's
nothing like
what usually
goes on
in dreams
though in
profound
non-ordinary
dreaming
experiences
the structure
of our
awareness
can take
on wildly
unexpected
forms
and natures
obviously
if we're
going to
experiment
with
waking
dreaming
we're better
off in
an environment
where the
threat level
is relatively
modest
although
if I remember
correctly
Sarah's story
involved her
being on a
train
one of her
stories
so I think
for now
I'll wind up
this walk
and talk
I'm very
grateful for
those of
you
who listen
and
reflect on
my sharing
explorations
and I'm
grateful to
all of you
who seek
insight
wisdom
kindness
intelligence
wonder
and play
for the sake
of all
beings
thank you
for joining
me
hope you'll
take a
moment to
like or
share
this
recording
if you
enjoyed it
and I
look forward
to future
explorations
together
again
very soon
peace for
now
