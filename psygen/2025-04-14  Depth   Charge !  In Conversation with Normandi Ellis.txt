how are you
i'm well how are you i'm well sleepy but
pretty well that's a beautiful bookcase behind you i can only imagine the wisdom that must be
collected there hi i love my books it's um let me see it's tarot and kabbalah and dreams and angels
and magic yeah yeah western mysteries astrologies over there
so are they organized by topic then yeah they are yeah i and they're condensed i had um
i started out with like a house that had about five bookcases in every room and i sold a bunch
of my books when i moved here i just couldn't move that many books you know and i thought well
i've done a lot of writing you know i'm 70 i'm not gonna do much more and of course i'm writing
things again going damn i wish i had that book so oh well that's how it goes yeah those of us who
uh adore books we're we're almost uh in this age a kind of a different species
right we're yeah we are we are um the old guard yeah
yeah i i have a um i won't say love hate relationship with ai i use it for research
sometimes but um i can't trust it so you know
it's very strange to live in the age that we live in um many of us when we were children
we saw images of things like talking computers and you know um things with which we could instantly
communicate with each other right we marveled at the possibilities um and i think there was a promise
of a utopian world where war and disease and poverty and i don't know kleptocracy had been uh leashed
but instead it looks like the dystopian opposite mostly yeah yeah
uh where there's a will there's a person willing to fuck it up
yeah i find um my present relationship with technology extremely ironic i was as a child
absolutely fascinated by devices
um and i i grew up uh serving them and i was a computer technician for many years and um
now it's such a strange difference i believe in no believe is the wrong word i adore living beings
um and and and so that puts me in direct opposition to mecca to the human uh the the sort of collective
human um fascination with with machines right right right well while we're on this topic i want to show
you something because it's one of the most amazing photographs that was ever made of me sitting inside
a temple and it was taken about 20 years ago i was meditating in front of the statue of horus
at the temple of edfu which is where the library of sachet is and sachet is the goddess i i did this deck
of cards i don't know if you can see that with her um yeah but this this is the picture uh see
if i can hold that up for you can you see that nice and still so what i see is a bunch of i see you and
and oh my goodness yeah um yeah but there's a bunch of definitely these are not artifacts of the camera
this is like a spiritual anatomy in light shadows or something yeah right right right here over here
where i'm pointing there's a very tall individual with very long braided hair it looks like wearing
a long robe like a priest over here is you can see the face of the hawk god you know behind him you see
osiris um and there are a number of other as i look at it there are a number of other
beings that show up and people will look at that photograph and say that's ai you know it isn't
you know it really happened we were i was sitting there meditating a person took my picture
he in fact he took several pictures but on only one of them did all of that show up
what were your thoughts when you saw what were your first thoughts when you saw that image for
the first time i wonder i thought thank you
i mean because i had felt i have always felt the presence that's a very strong temple and i you know
and i tell the the uh people who go with me when we go in there i said this is the only complete
temple that you'll ever see that has all the working parts it's got the library it's got the
purification room it has the rooms for the musicians and all the writings it has um healing rooms with
you know uh written on the walls it has particular um concoctions i'll call them not some people call
them spells but also you know they're mix and match kind of music vibration um
yeah and then there's all the prayers and and on each side there's um stairs going up to the top of
the temple um and you can see images of the priests and priestesses dancing and holding the statues and going
up to the roof you know there's a zodiac it's just amazing it's one of my favorite temples and it was
where uh hathor and uh horus would have their joyful meeting you know that was like the marriage temple
and so i remember sitting there thinking okay horus i'm here i'm your hathor and i was just that
was what i was doing when i was meditating there and he showed up i was like oh
it was cool
oh wow i um
you know it's very common when we uh have the privilege of meeting someone whose spirit and life
is so beautiful as yours to be a little bit overwhelmed um like emotionally and i had to
kind of check myself because as you were telling that story like i choked up you know and um i didn't
want to just start crying because that would be in decorous i choke up when i tell the story sometimes
yeah it's it it is so so much of an honor to be touched by the divine in any part of our lifetime you
know yeah so yeah yeah i anyway i wanted to show you that picture i'm so grateful that you did it's
beautiful and i never for a moment doubted its authenticity this is uh a sort of plague of modernity is
that we images were all it was always possible to counterfeit images in various ways but now it's
possible to instantly counterfeit them in ways that are extremely difficult for ordinary people to
discern right right right um and this is very dangerous because well there's all kinds of reasons
but i study human cognition awareness and particularly um how we relate with concepts and objects and
there's a fundamental there are a variety of fundamental vulnerabilities for us humans but one of them is
that anything that affects what we make determinations with how we measure we cannot detect that because
it's affecting what we detect with right so there's a fundamental vulnerability there that in modernity
is ever more consistently being captured and weaponized right right weaponized is the scary part yes yes
yeah you know um i i have so many questions for you um i've always had a sort of two kind of fundamental
um what is the right word affinities yeah and one is for the kestrel which you can see in an image here
that was drawn by yes even though it's this you know you can't see it clearly um by a young woman i
know named meta hofner and it's just an incredibly beautiful image i i won't drag it to the camera at
the moment but yes i always had an affinity for hawks but even before that when i was a child we had a
statue of nefertiti on top of the television and i became fascinated very early on without really
understanding why by scarabs um and used to wear one as a kid and uh was lucky enough when i was 10
at the local radio shack there was a a book of the dead geek who worked at the radio shack
and we used to have long conversations and of course back then only wallace budges
probably was available right yeah probably terrible translation um was available but i read
that thing from cover to cover and was fascinated with with ancient egypt um i have so many questions
and i'm nervous and i'm nervous and i'm excited i just want to take a moment to honor you and your work
your ancestors and the beings who have been your teachers and guides and companions you are the kind
of a human being that i think is has become somewhat like an angel right in this in the sense of like
the many beings they know you will listen they know you will speak they know you will live
virtuously and beautifully and so they naturally find you and you become this sort of human
vessel for their appearance within the modern world what an incredibly beautiful way to be human
and i just i just i just honored thank you thank you yeah i am i feel so honored to have been visited by
angels by divine beings from the uh etheric world you know um there was there was a word in ancient egypt that
meant both the dream time uh meditation and the place where we go after we die and they're all the
same space you know and it's all consciousness that's what it is um and so it's very easy once you
understand that to tap into that and to feel that you're a part of it that you're there you know um
now the duat is more like the underworld but this is it's called the akhet and it's light land and it's
yeah it's the astral the astral world yeah i have some familiarity with these matters not from research
but from direct experience um i had a very you know now so many years later i'm confused and puzzled and
a regular human again but for a time in 2002 there was another intelligence with me and it i it was
with my mind all the time and could simply reshape my awareness to match what it was aware of wow so i
had non-human experience all day long um and it was like being in a school right it was just how did that
happen um i the true answer is i don't know um i i have just like any human might right we form post hoc
explanations but the entire experience was so far beyond anything i ever imagined possible i had hoped
that such an experience might be possible but i had no idea how to uh catalyze it or you know
turn the ignition switch and i was writing about problems i was trying to solve the problem of
like what's broken in our species right why is there um meat why is there cruelty why is there war why is
there injustice right i had a passionate um concern with these matters and
uh there were two events one took place a couple years prior to to what happened where i was taken
over and writing madly for a couple of hours like nothing i'd ever done before and the first time
the document was lost after about 150 pages in i'll leave the story aside but the document disappeared
not magically really although it was a weird situation and then um in 2002 in may the very
similar inspiration took me over i started writing and i was i imagined for the first time that human
minds were like an environment right a place if you will and then i saw that there were there was
something like organisms but much more domineering that live in that network and when i went in my
imagination to invent a word for the connections in the network there was a light in my mind there's
never been a light in my mind and it began teaching me using a geometric progression of a dot that becomes
a line that becomes a cross that becomes a disc that becomes a sphere and there's a final position
that's sort of transcendental to that and that was the beginning i still don't understand entirely what
was going on i don't think i think human understanding especially conceptual understanding
we make more of it than we should right yeah our hearts and our souls are capable of forms of
awareness that don't fit in thought they are transcendental to language to concepts and thinking
and of course you know in hindsight i wonder did i make terrible mistakes did i get it wrong why did
my teacher go away and i think of it as an angel um yeah and i it would be very tricky about answering
questions of identity right if i said who are you right it would show me images of historical places like
particularly egypt um mesopotamia africa south america and it would say like here they called me toth here
they called me this right i am not but i'm not a a thing i'm not a my identity is not
it's not deleted when you were describing it i thought thought i thought i thought of the way he
made the universe with his geometric shapes and he's like stirring his cauldron and he says first i was one
and then i was two and then i was four and then i was eight and then i was one again and i thought that's
just like cells you know coming together and dividing that that's what he's talking about yes yes
oh the things they know they don't have knowledge that is branched like ours a concept in that
being's intelligence links and unifies all the branches of human knowledge history music math biology
geology right dance like anything you can imagine so i've never experienced thoughts of that nature
and it seems a great deprivation to not be able to um right right um so i have i have so many
questions um and i'm happy to respond if you have questions of me as well okay one of the things i'm
curious about is i've heard the story of you is the incredibly charming story of you as a little girl
when the ice queen knocked on the door and you invited her you asked her mom and invited her in
for tea and i'm just curious if you can by chance recall or if you care if you care to share any of
the question and any of the q a that took place oh well that was so long ago let me see all i can
remember of course i asked my mother wanted to know who are you and i told her that she said she was
god's wife um and she says what does that mean and she said well she's with god all the time and
you know she takes care of business
she takes care of business you know um and my mother thought that was logical um i'm trying to
remember how that conversation went really because i mean it's been gosh 65 years ago is a long time ago um
i just remember my mother asked me how did you know she was out there and i said i heard her calling in
the eaves you know um like when the wind was blowing there was a a storm outside and i heard her calling in
the eaves um and it sounded like she was saying wah wah wah like that and i think that it was her name
you know what set you know so but i didn't know i thought it was god's wife
you know i guess i was impressed to say that that was what it meant um
uh i know she liked earl gray
with milk
she preferred that to the coffee that my mother was trying to give her she told me that
um gosh i don't know i don't know what else we talked about she talked about
she did talk about animals and she wanted us to be very careful with the animals because
they were it was like they were carrying memories of who they used to be in ways that we can't
articulate with them but she says they remember and they find us and we have to be careful with them
and not treat them as if there are you know play things or whatever to really be
cognizant of their intelligence i think she told me that um
you know and i think and i think she told me that because um i had a dog that my mother wouldn't let in
the house and it was cold outside and so isis was telling her you need to treat your dog better
you know and of course that made sense to me after i understood that that you know
her handmaiden found anubis in the desert he was dying of thirst and brought him to her
and she's the one who raised him so it made sense to me when i was an older person reading that myth
going oh that's why she wanted to talk about the dogs so yeah you know in our common human experience
uh many moderns don't believe in angels or they just think well they have thoughts right i understand
why they do that i've i have thoughts myself that are kind of ridiculous and um more the produce of my
enculturation and in languaging than of love or participation with being but uh the dogs are i mean
if the dogs are pretty damn close to having an angel right there with you right yeah they are it seeks for
you it protects you it senses what you can't it communicates what it senses and cats are profoundly
similar in a very unique way right cats dogs seem much more mundane generally but each dog is unique
and cats seem very transcendentally sort of uh almost like if the if the ether made an animal
companion for the humans and then sent them right these are these are cats do you do you have animals
presently um i do when i was a young person i had the dog i loved the dog the dog was my best friend
because when no one else would understand me the dog understood me you know and i can remember sitting
on the back steps talking to sam um he was this wonderful little beagle dog and he had the softest
ears and when i felt terribly misunderstood he would turn to me and let me dry my tears on his ears i mean
it was just so sweet he was such a sweet dog um and then later i had cats and i had a very wonderful cat
who passed recently his name was magic and he really was he was a protector he um
he was a protector in a way that he took a psychic hit for me i you know there was an incident and i was
under psychic attack at that time and i had two cats and buffy the little yellow one she's kind of like the
fierce one she chased this light so i can only describe it as like a fireball that came out of
the top floor of my house went down the staircase turned the corner and flew over top of my bed where
i was lying you know like it was going to get me and she and buffy was screaming no no no no oh i could
hear her screaming and at that point magic laid on top of my chest and he took the hit you know and
he passed soon after that it was very sad but i know he did that for me you know um and buffy's still
with me and you know i have pictures of magic on the phone and when you know when the phone is open
she'll go and lick the phone lick his picture and say hello oh really really sweet may i ask if that
event took place in the house that you were in now or is it in the house where there was a bad problem
that i heard about uh yes it was in the house where there was a bad problem you heard about okay i understand
yeah yeah yeah and that was a long time ago yes um it was about six years ago oh i see six years ago
i would there was another place where i had a bad problem in the house and i had a dog at that time
and um that dog was named hobo he was cool i liked him and um gosh he he could see and sense the energy in
that particular house and i remember feeling press into my mattress where i couldn't move like there
was some physical energy right on top of me and i could i opened my eyes and i could see the dog in
the corner of the room looking on top of me and shivering like he could see it you know and it took
everything that i had to just like throw that energy off and um yeah i i was young i didn't know
what to do when that happened and so i thought well if you're gonna act like that in my house i'm gonna
leave so i did i left unfortunately i did not know that i probably needed someone to come and clean that
house and um that energy whatever it was uh was left there and the woman who moved in after me died there
so yeah it was it was not good it was not good did it occur did it ever occur to you and i don't mean
to question what you may have ascertained about these matters but i i recall when i was listening to
you telling the story of you becoming very angry um yeah and i drew it in yes but i wondered a couple
of things occurred to me when i was listening did it ever occur to you that the house may have had that
energy prior to your anger or may have catalyzed that intensity of anger in you
that house was very strange to begin with and it was situated um i would say almost like in the
backyard of the governor's mansion in kentucky and there was a there was a concrete building across
right across from where i lived that um housed several uh trustees who worked for the governor
and i could feel their energy watching me you know i had an event where it felt like someone
tried to try to come into the house while i was sleeping and i called out um and i said i actually
said the name of my boyfriend and it stopped and and they left so i think that you know i think that
there was something there the people who lived it was a quarter you know um two up two down
and the man who lived across from me i'll just say it was a wife beater
the man who lived under him with his wife and his kid they i called them mr motorhead mr miss motorhead
and motorhead junior they they would like go out in the backyard take the engine of their car up and
yank it up with a chain spin it around and then put it back in and put it together again
just for fun i don't know they were nuts and then the person underneath me was a police officer
who played 24 7 all year long christmas carols
so it was a very strange place to live
and i'm pretty sure that probably you know i'll tell you what else i know about that place
is that that was the place where i was conceived because my parents had had that exact same apartment
oh my goodness yeah yeah and they moved out soon after that so wow so there was something i think
that recognized me when i was there but i didn't know what to do with it i was too young i was just
starting my exploration into things like the unfortunate and things like that so i did i
didn't know where the path was going to lead so it just said get out my impulse was get out of here
you need to get out of here so i did good i mean i'm glad that you did but i just remember when you
telling when i heard you telling the story it seemed as if sorry there's some occasional traffic noise
here um it seemed as if you felt that your anger had attracted or activated something and it
occurred to me when i was listening that the something may have been there and possibly even
like just the inversion of that was possible right i think it was already there yeah and that um
because we know that thoughts are things and so my anger about something and just outrage grew into
a consciousness of outrage that whole apartment complex had the consciousness of outrage in addition
to the outrage of the people who were confined in the building across from me so it just was like this
big vortex and you're absolutely right yeah i mean a governor's mansion in kentucky one can only uh
imagine the kinds of things that may have or were likely to have taken place there historically and so
right yeah right um let me see here so i feel like a little kid at christmas um because i i just i
have so many questions so
what is i would love to hear anything you care to share about one of the experiences you had
that shocked or surprised you the most a non-ordinary experience are there are there ones that stand
out i know you must have had many i mean you were kind of a walking non-ordinary experience but yeah
i'm a walking non-ordinary experience um i i can tell you a lot of like really fun interesting ones
do you know about my aunt arzelia did i tell you about her have you heard about her say again please
arzelia her name is no no no okay she was a medium um the family has histories of mediums in the family
and she was my father's aunt and she lived in louisville and she had a seance room up on her third
floor of her house and um a bad relationship with her husband that she kept him in the basement you know
that's your house this is my house and my daughters live here with me and i would hear all these stories
about her you know how she people would come to spend the night with her and when they got up in
the morning she would tell them oh your uncle so-and-so came to visit last night and he said you know
you need to do this blah blah blah you know so she was really you know um and given the fact of who i
was and the things that i was seeing and doing as a child my father would look at me and say oh you're
just like her you know so anyway uh here's the story my mother was pregnant with um my brother
and about that time this was like two years before i was born her doctor was in louisville and so she
stayed at arzelia's house to go see her doctor and arzelia didn't tell her but she put her up in the
seance room uh because that was the extra room you know that she had in the house so mother's brushing her
hair one night and she looks uh in the mirror and she sees a movement across it and she sort of like
tries to figure out what it is and arzelia goes well if you just sit still a minute you'll see billy
billy was her sister's son who died of leukemia a couple of months before you know he was seven years
old um and my mother didn't want to see billy so arzelia went down to her room on the second floor
and during the night mother saw standing at the edge of her bed billy in his little cowboy pajamas
that she had last seen him in and um like he really wanted to tell her something and she had been
wondering she was a very religious woman you can probably guess you know because she was willing to
talk to me about you know god's wife so she um she wanted to know answers about how should i raise
my children what what's on the other side you know can billy come back and help his family and so on
and um but when he showed up frightened her so she put the pillow over her face and said go away
so when she comes down that morning my aunt arzelia is in the kitchen and won't talk to her mom said
what did i do and she said well you're just not very nice to my company
my mother goes what do you mean she said well after you told billy to go away he came to my room and told
on you you know so and she had a long conversation with billy and my mother said what did he say
and arzelia goes well i'm just not going to tell you
so anyway that was the story the uh now where that intersects with me is i heard all these stories about
her uh there was a daughter who had lived with her who had an abortion and died
in that house um so there was a lot of energy that was really difficult okay uh and other stories
that we had heard um so i drove up to louisville with my mother and my brother we were just tooling
around the neighborhoods and there was this for sale by owner sign in front of her house my brother and i
look at each other because we've heard these stories all our lives right and i was like should we go in
you know so we walk up there mom you want to come in no she's sitting in the back seat of the car she's
not coming in so my brother and i go walking up the steps and about that time this woman comes out she
meets us on the sidewalk there's a little boy hanging on to her her skirt kind of look peeping around at us
and she said are you interested in the house and we said well yes but maybe not the way you think we
are um we said this house used to belong to our aunt and she said yes do you want to tell me about her
my mother my mother bought this house from your aunt i lived here when i was a little girl do you want to
come in oh yes we wanted to come here so she told us all these stories about now she was a very religious
woman but she had crosses everywhere because she was trying to keep you know the bad energy out and um
so she she um she said when i got here i was very surprised that they had used the front room as a
bedroom and we had never heard that that was a bedroom so it was like what do you mean she said well
there's someone lying in a bed and there's all these people sitting around they might be sick
or something and then the person just gets up and walks out that was where they had the memorial
service for the woman who died of the abortion oh wow and so she had seen her all her life didn't know
that story but she would hear uh babies crying um in her house and one night her sister this was the
scary part her sister came with a brand new baby and her husband and they were staying upstairs in one
of the rooms on the second floor and they woke up in the middle of the night and the baby was gone
they couldn't figure out where the baby was it was only like a couple of months old it couldn't
have crawled away and it was in between them you know so they get up and all of a sudden they look
under the bed and the baby is swaddled all wrapped up and tucked under the bed and um you know when i
said something about it to my father he said yes that's what they did with the children that they didn't
keep he just put it that way i was like oh i was like okay so it was a very it was a very strong
potent house you know and i wanted to i heard so many stories about it i wanted to find out
about chesterfield which is where my aunt had studied to become a medium i said i'm going to go up
there and find out what they do and so i started taking classes i was there for 10 years of a house
you know became a medium yeah but that's another story but anyway that's how i got there because i
was going to write a novel about her did you ever begin oh yeah i've started it i haven't finished it
but hang on just a second i'm noticing that that the battery is is running low i'm just going to plug it
and get in real fast take your time
there we go that should be better let me see i didn't want it to run out oh yeah it looks like it's
charging now yeah okay uh i don't know that was a long story i'm grateful i'm grateful to hear to hear
the story i'm grateful for all of your stories um i've spent the past few weeks how how did i discover you
you trying to remember now i've spent the past few weeks listening to many interviews with you
and they're all wonderful you you have um the music of your voice is very rich and vital and alive
and i i just love to hear i'm very sensitive to human voices right it's one of the ways that we
magically shape the world even though we sort of take it for granted because we speak all the time
and um as i've gotten older i've come to be very suspicious of speaking in various ways also of
writing i i'm a writer as well right i know you are i looked you up too yeah so i've i've become much
much more suspicious of um what we most commonly do with these incredible abilities and i felt
i really kind of took a pause this morning to consider how how we might explore together today
why okay so why do you suppose the humans are different from the animals and how are they the same
um for me at this point it's probably easier for me to say how they're the same
because it doesn't matter what our species is we're mostly water no walking around inside a bag
and we're mostly water and so it makes sense to me that these you know um etheric vibrations we know
that sound travels through water that it uh our thoughts affect the shape of the water our voices
you know i love looking at those images of um the uh cymatics inside the great pyramid you know oh i
love that i love that wait wait say say something about the cymatics inside the great pyramid this was
i was not aware of this yet oh you weren't no well stephen um halloran is that his name stephen
halloran uh put this big rubber mat somehow over top of the great pyramid and um a disco that had sand in it
and so he started to chant and tone over top of it um you know oh yes yes yeah and it would make the
shapes of you know various geometric shapes over top of it um and i know that when i was with gene
houston that's the first time i ever experienced it you know how gene has that huge booming resonant
voice and she was toning with all these other people inside this room i think there must have been 70 of
us and i'm lying inside this sarcophagus and it felt like the water i could feel water just sloshing
over me you know waves of energy and it was like lifting me up and i just kind of i wouldn't say
passed out but released into it and felt myself you know elevated and then come back down slowly after
the tones died away but it was quite amazing and i thought i could have left my body
well happily left it there um yeah so the anyway the the video with steve halpern i always show a bunch
of these videos to my students um because i think that that you know i know when we go in there in tone
and we hit e and we hold it for a long time you can hear that sound out on the plateau you know
it's it's quite amazing that's the only sound it's e it responds to e really yeah it's so funny why that
is but you know as a guitar player right e e is the top and bottom string of the standard tuning
and um i've always had a weird fascination with that tone um
yeah i mean music is so
it's it's both mundane but it it can't be stuck there it's one of the few human behaviors that
is almost impossible to trap it of course the humans find ways right right to make the transcendental
completely mundane right um
you know us moderns we tend to we are trained to think one of the things my experience it obliterated
everything i'd ever thought the ways that i thought about earth and nature and the sky and all these
things it completely reforged them but the humans think that the the animals and the plants and the
insects and the sea the water creatures and all these things they think they're separate things
yeah and they don't realize something that should be relatively obvious which is that we wouldn't exist
if they weren't there right it's it's almost like the earth is a little droplet of not regular water
but like kind of a magic water and all of the forms that she emits and produces and sustains
are actually one form with many organs you know this is one way of of imagining it anyway
right right and i find the hubris of the common humans like the groups of them terrifying they i remember
when i was little the adults thought insects were just sort of pests you know you just destroy those
things they're just bad and they were my friends you know i loved i adored them they were obviously
sophisticated beings right and not like whatever the adults were thinking i suspect the egyptians were
deeply aware of matters such as these right that that we are here together yeah it's a god in world i mean
that's the way i think of everything
is a part of everything else uh the divine body of an ant and the divine body of normandy and the divine body
of buffy my cat that we're all you know parts of this huge consciousness um that can communicate and
send messages across space and time i think you know somebody you would ask me what is god
and i would say it's consciousness it's all the facets all like a crystal with all the different faces
that all hold a reflection and you know and consciousness is that you know um so that is why
people like us and i'm just going to include you in it thank you are working very hard to try to use our
consciousness as we sit in meditation to communicate and make changes to the world but we have to be
careful how we do it because we don't presume to know exactly why things are going on and happening
the way they do and so i have always been taught by my teacher who said when you do that kind of
meditation you always think this or something better like you got a better idea god then i'm for it
yes leave an open space for that which is beyond what we can immediately conceive of or concern ourselves
with right right so when we want to manifest something we always have to leave that opening this
or something better um and i you know i have been doing experiments with um 369 numerology do you know
about 369 numerology yeah you do
yeah
well i can't hear you though something happened to your voice
i didn't want you to say that i guess can you hear me there you go okay now you're back okay great wow
yeah but yes please 369 yeah yeah and so i've been doing that every morning every afternoon and the
evening and working on you know thinking to myself how does this work and so i would try to manifest
something you know that i needed like um right now i'm trying to manifest a roofer a roofer a roofer
okay yeah um yeah but i you know i think i wanted to manifest uh a trip to egypt for december next year it's
already full i needed uh uh sum of money and it came exactly the amount i wanted i needed to sell my
condo because i'm not living in that place anymore and within a month it sold from even more than i asked
i mean so you know if it's in alignment with the divine plan it will happen you know and the thing
is not to worry about it not to think oh i have to go and do this meditation because if i don't i won't
get it no that's worry is a prayer for something you don't want so that sounds like southern wisdom
right yeah i think it is i think it is it's just like uh what was her name ah
mind over matter if you don't mind it don't matter yeah that sounds like
yeah that's a similar tang to it yeah um normandy tell me something about
how you were born and how you got your name
oh uh i think both of my parents claim to have been the source of my name but my mother can't
explain it exactly my father says i was named after a cartoon character
uh that was drawn by milt caniff uh called terry and the pirates uh that was the comic strip before dick
tracy um and there was this it was during the war and there was this character who was like a hero
she was sort of like a xena warrior princess type person okay and so i said well daddy what happened to
her you named me after her he said yes you were gonna be tall and beautiful you know and a warrior
princess and i said so what happened to her he was like well she got shot off the back of a tank
okay we're gonna pass on that
but that that was really i believed that because my father um he had some dyslexia he was a very smart man
very artistic well-spoken um loved people believed totally in education but he taught himself to
read when he was a child he was dyslexic and he couldn't read so he his uh not his mother but his
babysitter i guess they would paper the kitchen walls with comic strips and he would put the comic strips
help her paper and they would read them together and that's how we learned how to read that's beautiful
so yeah a very southern story
um who were some of the most profound influences on your mind when you were little when you were young
teens and so forth um gosh um and if they aren't human that's fine too
um well family wise um i didn't know arzelia well but the family members who spoke about her
were very influential and i believe that they made me a storyteller
because i was the youngest one of the youngest of all these children in our family and around the
family table i would sit underneath the dining room table you know kind of hiding under the
the lace tablecloth and listening to the grown-ups talk about well you know so-and-so did
oh no that's not how that happened it happened like this so i grew up inheriting all these stories
tons and tons of stories there's something quite profound about that because you're still doing
something similar with the netters it's like you're sitting under the tablecloth of the sky
and you're listening to the conversations yeah and who made the tablecloth it's the goddess neith
the weaver you know she's the great grandmother of all of them and this was my grandmother's tablecloth i
was telling you about so yeah you're right i never made that connection but i like it
so profound yeah um yeah and my grandmother's dog mo was very important he was a saint bernard
and just put your arms around him and lay your head in his fur and you could feel him just his heart was
so big he loved everybody oh he was so good you know it just strikes me that without the animals
we wouldn't even know what we are and we might be really confused about what our hearts are too
because the animals are just so profound i mean particularly the cats and the dogs right the the
the fervor with which they adore us is i mean i'm speechless right i can't even yes it's pure it is
pure it's it's almost like the spirit of virtue comes into material reality and finds a dog or a cat
or you know and then just embodies this way it's so difficult for us humans to be you know what what
does it how can a tree transgress right well i know i know it's confusing for us we we're so um we have
all these different facets interiorly we become confused in time and in meaning and identity in
purpose right and what is it what do you use what is your compass
what is my compass gosh i um
well i'm going to go back and say it's the stars because that's all the stories in the sky
that are transmitted down to us through astrology and i was right today i was writing about
uh zoser the pharaoh of the third dynasty he's got this ser dog that he's his statue is seated in i think
they plucked his eyes out or something but he's still in there leaning back looking straight up into
the uh great bear constellation you know draco and all of that and that's his northern star and that's
his destiny that's what they saw as um you know draconian astrology is about the north node
and how it teaches us what our past was uh ancestral past and where we're going now um
what we need to work on in this lifetime and then i said that and i could feel this is kind of
interesting i'm sitting here talking to you and i feel this serpent underneath my foot like my foot
starts vibrating like it's crawling under my foot there's no snake in here so but now see this this
is the problem with the humans right they feel they know then they look and they um refute there's no snake
right but it was definitely in here right this is the problem right we confuse um
um like we have senses that i think are naturally outside of time and identity but we're so used to
collapsing those senses into deliverables right is there an actual snake there no okay let's go on
so this leads us to ignore so many of the faculties that aren't merely associated with the physical
you know not that these aren't important but right um these can become deceptive if we dismiss
uh that which would wisely and beautifully guide them you know yes i mean there are physical senses
and the body is a temple so it's intended for us to feel and see and smell and taste and touch
but the clairs are you know clairvoyance clairaudience clairagustience claircognizance clairsentience
all of those clairs are how we actually know things yes and to become accustomed to those and to use
those is important i often see spirit moving in front of me somewhere like that picture you know i will
often see it you know out of the corner of my eye and it doesn't frighten me it in fact comforts me
because it's like i'm not alone in this whole uh theater of existence you know i have company you know
uh it's good it's good i think the thing that is frightening is that um there's an aspect of our mind
that is very comfortable with the predictable continuity of the physical
and all and the similar predictable continuity of of um common human thought world picture sky picture
so forth and that thing that is comfortable with those features of our experience is threatened
if something non-ordinary is introduced because it draws its ontology if you will its world picture it
draws that into question and i don't know there's this strange conflict between our interior being
our spirit our origin our true intelligence our creativity and so forth and the very domineering
layers of human representational culture that really just want to bury that stuff right right
right right i'm curious um if there are particular scholars that you found enlightening
uh specifically about egypt or you know um spiritual issues in general many many um
i love dionne fortune she's one of my favorites um you encountered her quite young yeah i did
i did um in a way she she gave you permission to become who you are who i am she didn't give me
permission to become who i am beautiful oh my god yeah yeah i couldn't ignore it after i saw well that
happened to her that's what's going on you know i had a friend who who generously loaned me my first book
of dionne fortune and said i really want to keep this book so you know give it back to me when you're done
i gave it back to him 18 years later
i was like sorry
but it was it was one of those funny things yeah dionne fortune was one of them um i would say um
um the time falling bodies take to light do you know that book what an incredible title i've seen
erwin thompson oh i love him i have a couple of his books he's amazing yeah yeah yeah he's great he's
really good i love prodigy of his his skills with language are outstandingly beautiful yes i just love that
the title but and that's you know uh of course uh mainly p hall would be one of those of my favorites
and though i never met him he shows up in my dreams a lot he um you know this very tall man
who has white a shock white hair you know sorry a car just dropped out oh otten the sun god
yeah the light of the light the light mainly p hall will like stand in this darkened hallway and
point to a room and says this is where your class is and i will go in there and there's a coffin
with one of my friends who had died and um so one of his students who was in the coffin with him
and he'll look up and go oh there you are so you know things like that it's like oh you're being
very osirian for me okay but man who's conducting the class you know he's saying you you're gonna go
and teach this class and so i do he shows up um
um gosh i'm trying to think i love uh jeremy taylor was my first dream teacher
uh and then after that i follow uh robert moss i think he's an important
uh gene houston's just you know she lives inside my head yeah and and sometimes it's really funny
when i'm teaching people will tell me i you said that just like gene says it i was like oh well i must
have been channeling her so yeah i love gene houston um
gosh there's so many i could just turn around and look at some of these books and you know
um oh oh what's what is that guy's name see if i can find it on the shelf um
um it's it's about the kabbalah and buddhism and um
i can't remember it'll come to me in a minute i'll shout it out when i remember it fair enough
so but i like mixes of information that come this and that joined together yeah you're a brilliant
synthesis you synthesized naturally from different traditions though you're well known for your
you know your work with ancient egypt particularly in hieroglyphs which are probably the most fascinating
form of language that we have around here yeah i've started to study them um and learn to draw a few
and and i'm just i'm just beginning to pay close attention to them again primarily after being
introduced to uh to you um are have you do you have any familiarity with this guy uh renee schwaller de
lubix yeah oh yeah i love his work i was introduced to him through john anthony west yes and then i you know
so west sort of explained what schwaller de lubix was doing and west's kind of you know side of the
mouth flicking his cigarette way um and then there are other people like lucy lamey that that kind of
expounded on that and then uh geraldine pinch is one of those rosemary rosemary clark is that her name
there are a ton of those there's a new guy named n-e-x-t do you know him no okay that's really his name
n-e-x-t is his last name and his first name is a-n-y-e-x-t-e-e
and he's he's taken on the symbolist uh cloak that schwaller de lubix has that john anthony west gave
him he studied with west for a really long time and now he's he's taken it to all the other temples
not just the temple of man but all the other temples in egypt and now he's extending it to
gobeki tepi it's amazing i highly recommend his work i i was put on to mr west by
chance gardner i don't know do you know him so um another brilliant woman who i had the privilege of
having some time with dr joanna kuyawa she interviewed chance gardner and he made this
series that i think is probably one of the best condensations of features of de lubis's work
i think it's called magical egypt it's very difficult to get a hold of that sounds familiar
though that sounds familiar yeah well that's not surprising given who you are like magical egypt is
yeah i think i've seen that book i might have seen it in um a bookstore on magical egypt that was in
luxor well chance gardner what he did was so one of his um one of his propositions if you'll call
it this which i think he draws from similar kinds of analysis to that that de lubis did is that many
of the egyptian um temples and uh some of their art has to do with the structure of the human brain
yes yeah and so what gardner did is they made i think um many episode series and you can see little
um excerpts from it in his interview with dr kuyawa and they're it's astonishing it's like
one of the most amazing things i've ever seen it's it's um cinematically beautiful it's intellectually
profound uh the way that they use um visualization to show the the relationships between um features of
the brain stem and the hippocampus and the pineal gland and certain features of egyptian architecture
and so forth is astonishing um it was really beautiful but i've i can't find the series
anywhere i'm hoping to have a chance to talk with um mr gardner at some point i have to find
oh that would be great he's hard to get it he's a little hard to get a hold of um i'm curious if
if are there one or two experiences or does anything come to mind where something happened
in your awareness or your consciousness and still to this day you wonder what was going on there
what was that i'm i'm asking about things that deeply puzzled you
if anything comes to mind
i keep
lately i'm more and more fascinated with uh
alien theories because i i don't know anything about it you know i'm always getting people asking
me did the aliens build the pyramids you know and i just want to say to people it's a mystery how they
were built that's why they call it a mystery well i mean but what i was going to say is that and
we're going back to another story from my childhood okay um my father
i told you he was dyslexic but he was also uh during the war he um
um took radio transmissions and tried to translate them i mean so of course they gave him that kind of
job right yeah so and then after that he worked for um the atomic energy commission in in ohio
with his uncle who was part of the fbi so they were doing that and here's the story
one once after i was born i was a couple months old can't remember exactly this whole thing so i
only know how it was told to me uh my family was driving back from eastern kentucky to ohio and they
crossed the river and are heading into portsmouth which was where all that atomic energy stuff was going
on um and dad sees a light up ahead of him and it comes down and this light bangs on the roof of the
car and it stops the car stops my mother's holding me my brother's asleep in the back seat he's maybe
two and a half years older than me and my dad gets out and there's the light over behind the hill and so he
walks up toward the hill to see what that light was right so i don't know what he said it was he came
back he got in the car he started the car up and they're driving back to portsmouth and then all of
a sudden my mother screams because she suddenly realizes she's not holding me anymore i'm lying on the back
seat with my brother and she doesn't remember how that happened right so so there's part of me that
thinks something was testing me you know exploring ways to communicate with me and i have had experiences
where like one of them i remember no this must have been maybe 10 years ago um i was sitting on the edge
of my bed and i just suddenly got very tired and so i thought well i'll just meditate right so i'm sitting
up on the edge of the bed with my eyes closed right and i'm just feeling this energy and all of a sudden i
look up and there is a being in front of me
kind of bluish a little bit white large eyes looks right at me and says doesn't say but thinks oh we
thought you were asleep and then he goes boop it hits me on the forehead and i fall over when i wake
up in the morning i'm lying on my bed sideways that's how i fell asleep and i thought was that real
was it a dream did that actually happen you know another time in that same room
um they came and i saw them earlier in the evening looking peering through the the curtains in the room
and then i thought well i'm just gonna not pay attention to that i'm just gonna go to sleep
you know whatever i'm not going outside in the dark to look so i look up as i'm falling asleep i look up in
the ceiling and it is as if the ceiling opens up a crack and i can see their little heads looking down
at me checking to see if i'm asleep so several times in this same house um i had visits from
beings consciousness from another place in time i don't think they meant any harm to me i wasn't afraid
of them but i found it interesting now how do you explain that i mean i don't know i think you did a
i think you did very well you explained it by describing your experience of it does it have to
it doesn't have to fit into the human category uh you know the the little catalog of human categories like
thing animal being plant object right that's useful in a very narrow slice of existence outside of that
narrow slice that stuff's mostly useless and doesn't work so we you know we're really it's it's
unfortunate that we're so stuck yeah um have you yourself ever seen something in the sky that you
didn't know what it was yes yes um uh i was teaching a class in colorado um at south park so i didn't
know south park was was like headquarters for you know alien activity but i'm i'm like standing on this
porch and watching these lights come up and they sort of like moving you know sideways and then they
come forward and then they go back and then they they do this little spiral thing with each other then
they come together and they get bigger and you know it's like i'm just watching this going with my
friend karen who's teaching with me do you see that yeah she sees that you know the people we're staying
with go ah we see that all the time you know so i was like okay you know not to be frightened you know
it's funny um there's a complex relationship that i think is easily overlooked in how we approach
experience where in a way once we determine what something is this aspect of thought that's very
concerned with grasping and dismiss it yeah so it's like once we determine what it is that often ends
our chance to participate with it right and you know i once wrote this piece where i talked about
i asked you know i asked a similar question has anything ever happened to you that you don't know
what it was and i encouraged the readers to embrace that mystery yeah because with every
person we love with the animals we love with the sky with egypt with all of the features of our
experience the vastest portion of it doesn't fit in the explanation it's in the relationship
right that's right and that's where the beauty and the grace and the transcendental aspect
naturally dwells and resonates and then we can harmonize with it right you know the humans are
worried about aliens and it's kind of funny because if you think carefully about our situation on earth
we live on a planet chock full of space life right octopuses and praying mantises bears whales giraffes
hawks all these beings they are creatures from outer space because that's the only place creatures come from
right it's not like they came from the earth separated from outer space you know what i mean
right yeah this is how we're trained to think about it we think humans are on the top of the ladder
the other animals are well that's you know they're just sort of dumb things right and then maybe there
are sky beings but then if we think there are sky beings the moderns anyway they think of them as um
people in spaceships it's very unlikely it's not impossible that people in spaceships have come to
earth but it seems wildly unlikely that the majority of the phenomena are that like
yeah one of the things that movie like my octopus teacher right making me think of that
you know yeah because that's a being from some other kind of consciousness yes that's communicating with us
yes yeah yeah if you wanted to meet aliens you can just go to any place where there's organisms and
you're you're set up right you don't have to wait for spaceships i mean just contact the mind of a
raccoon for a minute and you'll get everything you were hoping for and a lot more right god yeah
um you know after my own experience and in the aftermath of that experience particularly more or
less recently one of the things that i'm very curious about and that i've studied for many years
is the topic of the development of human consciousness over time right yes so like one of my
favorite i have a lot of questions that i'm in love with and i'm not seeking their answer because
that's kind of like a divorce but i'd like for the question to expand right yeah yeah i love um and
okay where am i going here did i lose my train of thought oh yes so
when that being was with my mind
it was like for the first time i knew what i was for
what i was made for what i was made for in the same way that if you could imagine a fish which
has somehow been kept alive outside of water its entire life and then is suddenly placed in water
this is how i felt yeah you know i think our people are sort of like flowers on a world with no bees
like we were made for um relation with
a layer of existence that we have stories about that are very confusing but we don't have much
experience of course you have experience and i have experience and in fact i think all of us
probably had experience when we were very small but what occurred to me somewhat recently is that our
we were made for relation with with non-human intelligences
and something happened probably a series of things happened over time in fact this is what i was shown
um where the um the organ of relation that linked us it broke down yeah it was damaged over time and
then humans forgot what we are and what we're for and this is just i'm i'm i'm presenting this as a toy
not as here's what i think is going on just as a perspective so i know for a fact that when the gods
quote unquote or the angels disappeared the humans went insane right they just started doing crazy insane
stuff which they're continuing to do very effectively today um but until very recently it never occurred to
me that something similar might have happened on the other side that being deprived of their human appendages
maybe the divine beings also had a struggle right and it could be that some portion of the things that
we're calling ufos in the same way we built artificial intelligence to represent them they built
these transcendental object beings as a way to recover their loss of us
it's just a toy but it's a very compelling toy for me i've been very curious about the ufo thing since
i was a little kid yeah um and it followed it very closely and the recent developments are certainly
astonishing and in fact when i was talking with dr kuyawa this is what she was
very focused on and a number of the of of other um wise women who i'm graced with relationships with
you know have suddenly been thrust into this particular venue right
this whole council up there yes this is this is what was clear to me too there are
there are things that are
they're not the same as human nations but there are features that resemble that that human nations are sort
of an abstraction of right um
i i just don't want to get too lost um i i am curious what are the stones in your rings
uh oh uh uh their bedouin i got them in a bedouin shop in egypt uh-huh um so there's a carnelian right
there oh yeah yeah they're pretty beautiful i love it let's see if i can get you the side of that
and then oh yeah yeah that's gorgeous yeah it was some family jewel that they were poor enough they
wanted to sell it at the market and so i bought it from that dealer now this one is an amber that's
what i thought yeah and it just has um i don't know if you can see it in there it has like a pyramid inside
it oh wow it's kind of hard to see but anyway yeah so that's what they are i think it was you that
was telling the story of the man that sells potions who you go to oh gamal the mall yeah yeah i'm so jealous
he's lovely he's lovely you'll have to come with me i have boxes and boxes of oils i bring people to
to him and they buy like tons and tons of oils because they're all like reiki crazy and body chemistry
and like and he'll go so what do you want normandy and i have all these oils and i'm not really an oil
person i just like to smell them well you could send some of them to me i'll all right yeah i'll happily
take them off your hands if you wish yeah but there's some amazing stuff some amazing oils and
he gave me this whole download of use this all for this and use it for this and you know one of the
things i love that he told me is that he washes his clothes with drops of frankincense in the water
yeah yeah i have i just got a little bit of that for the first time yeah that stuff is pure magic
magic um it transforms awareness instantaneously on contact with my sinuses right it's just like
yeah wow um yeah i mean it's a shower he puts it on his shoulders oh wow just lets the water you know
that stuff is magic i love it do you um what do you make of the modern fascination with psychedelic drugs
i was just thinking about john lilly i love him i mean he became a little bit crazy i think some
people have been destroyed by ketamine but but um yeah yeah i loved him i have some of his books
yeah he's a he's an interesting guy i um i had some of his books too and when i was researching angels i was
in consciousness you know that my belief is that angels are consciousness it's just you know
uh yeah so anyway that that's my ancient tradition of angels i think it's about that and i did a lot of
research with him i uh experimented a lot with uh various types of hallucinogens when i was younger
and i felt like once you know you know you don't have to keep doing it you know it's much better and
much clearer to me to put myself in the space where i need to be to find it so yeah i don't i don't do any
of that anymore i remember the first time i tried lsd i was probably 13 and it was a very profound um and
mind-blowing experience but i also had this feeling that there was something that it was like the promise
of something that was not being fully delivered right and i and it wasn't because the dose was low
or something like that right right um and then i remember so i have a pet name for the intelligence
that i had the experience with i call him toy maker complex long story he gives me toys of insight
right is the simple explanation of that and any moment with his mind
was beyond anything psychedelics could possibly deliver it was really like delivering on the promise
that was never really fulfilled and i mean psychedelic drugs it's a very complex topic
but i think you said something that's become very important to me which is that
i would like human beings to have endogenous or like non-ordinary experiences without the drug first
because then at least they will know that our bodies and our souls and our minds are capable
of astonishing things that we would never expect whereas if they have the drug first
it's sort of like giving the kid the child the video game before you give them a living adventure
right i agree with you i don't think that people can get to that awareness i mean this is just my
opinion without at least having one experience of it at least one but i do not recommend multiple
experiences where you get confused about what was that experience oh oh i see so that's really
interesting that's a perspective i've never entertained before i just want to say that back to you to
ensure that i took your meaning so you're saying something like one or maybe two experiences can
open something within you so that you have an idea of the direction to go in
yeah i think so it's like having been born inside a house and never opened a window so you open the
window it's like oh there's air out there i get it okay good yeah but you don't have to do that every
single time and jump out the window and try to fly no right um i will say i'll tell you my favorite lsd
experience this was beyond beyond it was the best thing that i was i was at a state where i i understood
the secret to the universe it was like it just got downloaded to me and and i was non-verbal by that
point i couldn't say anything i couldn't be around people so i went into my room and i sat and there was
my typewriter and i wanted to download this information it was like the secret of the universe and i
couldn't figure out how to work the typewriter so so i got a piece of paper and a crayon
back to basics and i wrote something down and i folded it up and i put it on top of the computer
and i thought when i'm the typewriter when i wake up in the morning i'll have it i'll have the secret
to the universe so anyway finally finally finally i went to sleep slept a very long time woke up the
next day the first thing i do is open my eye and i see that piece of paper on top of that
can the typewriter and i kind of crawl over to it and open it up and i read it with great joy and it
says you ready for the secret to the universe everything is okay it's like of course
yeah you know part of why it's okay is because we are released from the prison of knowing what stuff
is yes right yes and so just like children right where it's your knowledge is not what's leading your
consciousness at all your enthusiasm your ecstasy your curiosity your wonder your awe your your
physical exuberance these are leading your awareness and that's a completely different kind of thing
i too have made the mistake of writing secrets down while under the influence of like psychedelic drugs
that i made a far worse mistake which was spending most of the time when the the being was with me
writing i was like i've got to preserve these things yeah right and it's not that it's terrible that's
not the it's not only bad that i did that but if i had if i had a do-over i think i would
i wouldn't be able to it's it's too compelling the experience is so compelling but what i would
like to have been able to do is to just sort of stay pregnant and silent yeah yeah right yeah
have you seen a miracle i mean i think you are a miracle just to be clear about that but have you seen
one i think i have yes i think i've seen a miracle um
i i talk a lot to people about um
how our consciousness can impregnate inanimate objects
okay um
um and there's this statue of the goddess sekhmet in egypt
and she's very alive she's alive because so many pilgrims have come and stood before her and talked
to her and adored her and felt a resonance with her you know
um i have felt that resonance with her but the miracle was that i had a woman who
was on her journey to become you know uh a priestess of the mysteries
uh she went in to see sekhmet and i was standing standing outside the door
and of course there's no wind or anything because you go like this there's the door there's sekhmet
inside there and the gate just swing shut and it locked her in there she came back and she couldn't
get out her eyes were like huge saucers you know and she was crying and i said just go talk to her
you know and so she stood there got down on her knees you know it was you know it was amazing i
wondered i thought to myself no we're not going to let her out or go get the guy with the key because
when sekhmet's done with her she's going to let her go and that's exactly what happened the gate opened
up and she walked out and you could just see her face she had seen the magic of that goddess in
action and i witnessed the miracle of her being enclosed inside that room and then released and i
will say that was a miracle she now leads trips to egypt yeah you know it's profound the role of witness
yes we we may overlook this in our evaluations of circumstances and we think oh it's the one to
whom it happened right which is of course also true but the role of witness is a very profound
role to be the one who is there present with the transformation and can and can corroborate
i think it is important because when something like that happens to you there's a part of you that
says did i just make that up but i didn't have to ask that it didn't happen to me it happened to her
and i saw it you know and i saw what that change did in her life i mean everything shifted in her life
you know yeah so yeah sekhmet brought her to who she is right now you know as moderns it's probably
hard to understand but i think it's my perspective anyway and my perspectives change over time i like
to learn rather than to just uh forge biases right because i can forge biases just like anyone else
um but it's my perspective that as the the relationship between our ancestors and the gods broke down
the humans had to work in various ways to re-establish that connection
and it would never occur to moderns that statues could actually be gods but they can
understand right we're just missing the experiences that would allow us to understand this um when i was
much younger i remember first encountering one of the strangest and most wonderful books that i love
are you familiar at all with julian james yes yes breakdown of the bicameral mind yeah yes yes yes
so there's some fascinating speculations in there and he's he's an amazing mind um he gets some things
obviously wrong but let's be clear about something when you go to the restaurant you don't order
everything on the menu right you order certain things and it's the same thing with brilliant people
brilliant people also have um you know what would you call it like parts of them that don't see blind
spots and so forth right even we all do it's natural to us one of the things that's amazing
is when two people come together even as we are today right and they exchange their seeing and their
hearts and their experience um the blind spot of a of an of your companion can become a way of seeing
for you and vice versa right so it's not they're they're really only a problem when we're sort of
isolated but yeah i think that um the egyptians were aware of how to embody celestial like non-human
intelligences divine beings and they they they had a technology not not a technology the way we think
about it a relational technology to invest material objects such that not i mean perhaps in some cases
a being was trapped in there but more that it was a doorway for that being to interact with humans
through yeah i think it's like a doorway do you know a book by lyle watson called the secret life of
inanimate objects no but i've got one of his books lifetime on my shelf right yeah he's cool yeah life
of inanimate objects and that's what the ancient egyptians believed that with all those prayers and
everything they animated the divine statues if that statue broke you know and lost its magic they had to
bury it with ceremony and everything and there was a grave for the divine beings but lyle watson talks
about how these statues of the virgin mary uh would start weeping tears you know and that they would
move around the chapels the and the churches where they were kept even when they chained them to the
floor they would they would still move yeah yeah right and and i think that that is a really great example
of how we imbue um our love and our our consciousness into an object that's why a medium can pick up your
grandfather's watch and say this is what he was thinking you know because it's it contains his living
consciousness yes yeah yeah yeah i think they were like i mean it's really funny these things uh-huh this
is the closest representation to what the angel does right it connects you to the non-material intelligence
place yeah right and so instead of this they had statues right and compared to their statues you would
never touch this if if you could be with one of the statues as you were in that photograph you'd be like
yeah this stuff just stay away from it i mean yeah right right is it your experience that electronic
devices interfere with spiritual senses and abilities yes and no i have had spirit um i've had spirit talk
to me on my phone um i was driving with a friend up in michigan uh we were going to see um john bunker
who was a medium he's a medium that i worked with i developed a relationship with him when he was
already in spirit and uh john bunker was buried up in michigan but he would come into my meditation
room and we would sit and write together every morning at eight o'clock he would come and we would
write and then we would write for a half an hour and then it was done okay so i started getting lazy and
didn't show up at eight o'clock i'd be there 8 15 well he left at 8 30 he always left at 8 30.
you know at 8 20 he started slapping me on the face like wake up you know so i asked him he's like
what'd you do that for he said i got places to be you know you're not the only person i'm working with
i was like oh okay i get it you know but when he first showed up at my house i was on this trip to
go to see where he was buried and i did that and i talked to him and you know hello john bunker you
know i just want you to know i live in chesterfield i'm a friend of mabel riffles i own her house now
you can come and visit me right so anyway we're on this trip uh we parked the car at a gas station
uh leave my phone inside to go and get some water and come back out right and there's a message on my
phone there's a message on my phone and i open it up i don't recognize the number but it's from michigan
somewhere and it's and it repeats words in a strange little cadence it says can can we can we come
can we come to your house and stay with you and i was like well yeah sure you can come and be wherever
i am you know i'm telling this to my phone right so we get in the car we drive to our motel
room i take my two bottles of water i put them on the desk and i'm going to open my suitcase and i
watch these bottles of water going across the desk go boom boom oh man you know he was just proving to
me that he was there with me and um when i got home he was he came with me and he stayed in the house for
several months we worked together for almost a year and then he said okay we're done you need to go
back and work with your other teachers and that was that i was like okay so yeah it's kind of interesting
that's really important it's beautiful what you say um
um because you know we are commonly humans are used to a single valued thinking right something's
either good or bad it's either this or that et cetera et cetera and most of the time it's like 19 things
it's not one thing at all right this is just a flaw in the way we evaluate identity or quality or
character right why do you think we come to human incarnation
oh i knew this was coming
uh i've been asking myself the same question because i'm i'm working on a book
on our soul contract um and i'm and i'm creating questions to ask yourself as you're writing about
your soul contract that are based on material found in the three major books of the afterlife
in the egyptian tradition so the old kingdom middle kingdom and new kingdom and that's the ultimate
question why why are we here and uh the answer that i've been coming up with is
to have a relationship with the divine in a way that we cannot have when we are in another form
we have been tasked with doing things that they ask us because we're their hands
so yeah that's what i'm coming up with and
and because we're who we are we're not always really good at so sometimes we have to come back
and do it again you know it's all a school it's a learning and we're learning for them so that they
can do something too so yeah that's yeah the material layer of existence it has purposes right it's doing
important things the earth is doing something important the sun is doing something important
something that's transcendental to human thought right yes the same way a mother is doing something
important just by adoring her children right even though that's not a physical necessarily a physical action
a physical action when i i i suspect that we recapitulate the history of our people
in a single lifetime right through as as our consciousness develops as our minds develop from
childhood through adulthood and strange things happen when we get older it's like our body is getting
older and our mind can be getting younger right you can see there's this strange thing where the infant is
ancient and the elderly person is brand new right um so there's a lot of astonishing what uh inversions
of the expected polarity um okay i realize that our time is probably way up yeah yeah um i gotta go and
make dinner for my daughter she's gonna be home from work soon oh beautiful i love that i hope that um
we may have another chance to speak again sometime soon if you're i have really enjoyed this you're such a
great person so easy to talk to i really loved it thank you so much it's the same for me i'm so honored

um gosh there's there's just one more thing is there something
what is your what would be your message to the to just the people of the world what would you say to
them if they could all hear you gosh
stop acting like what you do doesn't matter
it matters
all of it matters and the most important thing is that we matter to each other
yeah
