so this is the first time we've had a chance to talk together william and i'm i'm quite excited
um you reached out to me i think after seeing some of my recordings about almond hillman or perhaps
the uh the conversation that i had with him recently yeah you had a conversation a month or
two ago i guess it was with him and um i mean i was very impressed with your your ability to
take in what he says and kind of condense it into a single sentence and understand it and uh
so you know you seemed uh you know just brilliantly intuitive about language and uh some of the things
that i think he was even struggling to express you seem to understand it and i i think that was uh
you know i was kind of hoping that maybe you'd have some understanding what i was
seeing and thinking and it seems like that you not only understand it but have have experienced
some of it as well so that's uh kind of kind of makes it a you know unique uh conversation so i'm
very glad that you were willing to to talk to me and stuff so i'm super excited to talk to you um
you're one of the only people who seems to have had this kind of um intuition
that there's something underlying all the linguistic systems that humans use that could conceivably link
them together or demonstrate a kind of a a root of origin or concern that i don't think obviously you
know there's been tens of thousands of people who've looked into uh the origins of language and humans
and the origins of writing and so forth it would be i think premature to suppose that none of them had
a similar intuition i'm sure many people have had an intuition like that or just a sense or even have
discovered something but i'm not aware of very many of them it's a it's an uncommon thing when someone
uh you know sort of runs the flag up the flagpole that says hey there's something here that's being
overlooked right that we're just not seeing it and um in my own experience uh it's blatantly obvious
that there are root aspects to human language and particularly writing systems but not just writing
systems sound as well the way that we use sound like i remember um when i was a kid at some point
probably first grade something like this maybe second grade i went to my teacher and i said um
you know we have this i didn't say this articulately but i said you know we have this word to see
right and and then we have the word the sea the ocean right and i said surely there's a relationship
between these two words she said oh no no it's entirely arbitrary right and i was like i don't think
it's arbitrary i mean not to mention the fact that um you know the sea is made of salt water and our eyes
have salty water in them right so you know even as a child i was you know i was fascinated by by language
in general and um i think there's there's a broad array of features that just don't get any airplay
because in modernity we have this uh the sort of bizarre objectivist uh predisposition right that
that just makes wild ridiculous claims for which there's no evidence like well there's no connection
between these things yeah i think that that's what a lot of people would say it's either coincidental
or you know it's just uh i i can't remember the the you know if you see things in the clouds that's uh
it's somewhere yeah there you go that was the word and uh that kind of prevents them from seeing beyond
that and uh so years ago we had some people from google here and he was pretty high up in in google and
you know they have a slide in their main office and all that stuff and he was looking around and
he looked at me and he goes well you really think outside the box and i and i just kind of made it up
at the time i just looked at him and go shh there is no box and he goes i'm going to use that in the next
talk i do you know because there you only think there's a box because you're told there's a box
and there's when you step out of the box and look back you realize there's there's not a box
you know my son the other day was saying that um i'm going to paraphrase him slightly he was saying
you know dan i think this whole uh objective um empirical uh slant that the humans are fascinated by
is a result of them having no idea what they are and since they have since we have no idea what we
are then we project that absence of knowledge onto the exterior onto the exterior world and just try
to determine what everything is out there right and and then we kind of related to each other and
the other things that we've created but i was kind of playing with this idea so i you know i've spent
a lot of time with the uh figuring out what the the different alphabet letters and sounds mean and then
i kind of applied that to you know first english in different languages and then i kept expanding
i probably looked at over 300 different languages and when i got into the native american languages
i started finding very similar patterns repeating themselves as as i saw in africa and other places
and it just came uh you know very obvious that this pattern exists but until you are aware that the
pattern exists you can't you can't really take it in and i started looking at like how we
how we structure our lives on things and a lot of what we do i i yeah i'm sure you're familiar with
what a cargo cult is when the you know in the south pacific during world war ii people who had been
relatively uncontacted you know something falls out of the sky a pilot it could be japanese or american
pilot and they made uh you know they tried to make sense of it because it's some new uh thing in their
life and they don't understand airplanes or radios and they incorporated that into their their life
without really knowing the technology and kind of us as the we'll call our you know the technologically
more advanced we can look at that and kind of say ha they you know they don't understand that and they
we kind of label that as a cargo cult but then when you look back at our own culture
most of what we do is cargo cult and very little of it is based on you know objective testable
even in even within the sciences so much of the sciences you know if you look at uh you know you
probably remember that when they used to say two eggs is over your daily cholesterol diet and of course
there was very little science to that and their model for what cholesterol was doing at the time
was completely backwards of what you know scientists would say today but
everyone would agree that this is just it must be true because you know it was on tv and so that
that kind of gets incorporated to people's thoughts i'm sure you've heard of the uh
when they they invented radar uh the british released a story that their pilots were eating carrots
that's why they could see at night and so it was an mi6 cover story for the fact that they have
a machine doing this they didn't want the germans to know that they could see them at night
and then the germans had to run around and start eating massive doses of carrots and it didn't
and even to this day most people would believe
these kind of you know stories become accepted as as in it it starts to form this
this kind of cargo cult mass that you have difficulties seeing beyond and and uh every now and then it
takes somebody to kind of step outside of what's been accepted and say hey wait a minute i don't know if
this is this is reality or is this is this just a a kind of a group uh a group agreed upon you know
mythology or or and it seems like language you know the if if you uh so i used to work at monticello
uh or thomas jefferson's you know home and uh it was pronounced monticello but there were people
from a town in i think it was in new york and they said oh no it's monticello
and of course the correct pronunciation is monticello and the and the town is actually named after
monticello the house but because everyone in that town calls it monticello
now the correct pronunciation is monticello because the locals call it that
and so the origins doesn't doesn't reflect what's actually being said the new agreed upon meaning
for a word could be something very arbitrary something very different from what was originally
uh you know like words change meanings over time and you kind of have to go with what the group
except as the meaning of something but as this happens you get further away from
um i'll just call it my system that i was using is alphaglyphics is what i named it it's perhaps
arrogant to just come up with a name like that but it has to be called something and uh it's it's it's
the structure that i think is forming language but as languages age they get further away from the
original system
and that's that's what kind of really got me interested when i started looking at other languages
languages so like if you look at portuguese it's a latin language but it doesn't feel very much like
spanish or italian spanish and italian kind of you can mumble your way through some italian if you know
some spanish they seem close but you would still see if you if you read the uh portuguese
it's based on the same ancestral you know it has the same latin roots but they've so changed how
they pronounce things it's very difficult to at least it is for me to to pick up the words the same
so italian is fairly easy even if you don't know italian if you just know a little bit of spanish you can
you can you can get your way through italy pretty well and these same words are in the portuguese
but pronounced you know they they've they've they've changed john john to jow you know they've gotten
rid of their a lot of letters have changed to the point where it's very difficult to to recognize things
and then uh you know my wife is uh well she's from crimea so that uh whatever country that is and
largely russian and so having someone whose native language is is a different language and you have
to explain why we do this or why we do that you start to have to actually you know a lot of times
you just don't know why you know well you're an english speaker you should know why i said i don't
know why we did you know you just you just have these accepted norms of of what you grew up with
but there isn't a lot of logic to it and then as i was going through in the system and i started
discovering a bunch of things and i was like oh that that's why there's a you know the silent k in
english suddenly makes sense now if you look it up people will say well they used to say knife and that
isn't actually why they're doing it but it it represents the hand in the word because the the
letter k if you take your the imprint of a hand and flatten out your fingers your two end fingers
you get the letter k if you draw your your first finger and your last finger as a straight line
you get the k off your hand and uh you know that that is sort of the accepted
original origins of the letter k in the phoenician uh alphabet to some degree and it shows up
in little relics in language and i i kind of you know finding those little
weird little things like that because if you go through your mind and make a list of the the kn words
that you know from english most of them will be knocking or some sort of k and and the k with the
n i mean i i don't know how far you want to jump into this um but the letter n becomes rather hard to
the letter n is more complicated and the letter r is more complicated in how it interacts with other letters
and so that that it was uh that's kind of explained if you if you think of the k in the n going together
and i really saw that particularly when i started looking at other languages
uh when i started looking at the japanese so i believe you said you you had done some martial arts
and and i'm not going to test you on your dojo skills but you know i had uh and i just like quoting uh
my sensei was sensei marvin and i just uh i like saying sensei marvin it just seems like a silly name for a sensei but
he made us speak japanese so ah and i took
uh okinawan shorin ru and ru is a school and shorin was the type of school and as far as i knew that's as
far as we went but as i was looking at language i realized so the japanese have no letter l
and they often put the letter r instead of l and is actually shaolin ru and it comes from the shaolin temple
and it is actually and i never looked up the history before but there was a
a uh a woman who who developed white crane uh kung fu i think it was at the shaolin and she went to
okinawa and that that is the origins of the karate that that started in okinawa
and so now i suddenly realized that oh shao shao rin shaolin was shaolin
and you know uh i work in a scientific editing firm and we we we edit papers primarily from japan
um send me some noise for a moment and um
the neuroscientist i work with he worked in japan for quite some time
and apparently at some point uh the japanese scientists and perhaps even the government
may petition
to be able to write papers in english but they wanted the the letter l removed
they wanted to be able to write english without l
so you you've heard of the store lululemon yeah yeah so the guy invented the store the name um
to he's like i want something with a lot of letter l's in it because
just like we had haagen dosh in america which basically means nothing but it sounds foreign
he thought he thought lululemon would do real well in japan because it sounds so
it's so it's so challenging for them to say and so that's why he came up with lululemon because it
had three l's in it and he just thought it was funny so i have a couple of thoughts about some of the
things you've shared before we continue too much further um the cargo cult thing is a serious problem
uh it's a problem so you know a lot of my work has to do with the origins of human cognition and sort of
the the arc over time of how the forms of cognition that we are subject to today developed and what
they developed from right and um one of the things you'll see that that is it's more than evidence
for the cargo cult problem it's a blatant uh demonstration of the problem is that humans build
machines and then they reify organisms in the image of the machines right so your heart is a pump
your brain that's a computer right your everything is just seen it's almost as if people were ignorant
enough to say that you're a cartoon because you're animated i mean you're obviously animated
right so you must be a cartoon um there's no real relationship between machines and organisms
right but every time we invent a new machine we then reify some feature of the organism as if
it were originally a machine and you can see a um you can see in this a peculiar feature of our
predilection to sort of kill down into structure things that we have lost intimacy with right because
actual knowledge is is about intimacy it's not about thinking there are precisely zero objective
observers in the universe there's no such thing as an objective observation that's a fiction of
statistics right we suppose for example that if joe tim john jane and julie all see a raccoon and they
all call it a raccoon and they you know they all agree that this is how you say that word well then we
suppose that's objective right it's a statistical convenience there are no objective observers it
is impossible to have an objective observation there are no such observers all observers that we know
of are subjective right i mean you may have a different perspective and i'm i'm happy to hear about
that if you do but generally speaking what we as humans think of as valid knowledge is merely um well
it's not merely it's mostly the vox populi fallacy if everybody agrees then we'll call that objective
um empirical observations are profound useful and real within a very narrow scope right within the scope
in which empirical observations function and by the way this scope is engineering it's physics it's
mathematics right these branches of knowledge give us the impression that perhaps everything should be
empirical um so there's this weird problem with human cognition where we switch out intimacy for
representations we switch out understanding for mechanical facility and so forth and then the other
thing is just who decides what's correct is is that just uh or would we do a poll right whoever like
64 percent of people think that it should be called monticello right or whatever right how do we decide
so there's and then there's another problem which i think you also identified which is drift over time
right there there were some originary features of language and alphabets and so forth and over time
those drifted and underwent um kind of regenesis in various ways in various places at
various times and those transformations were affected by um specific predilections of the people involved
um specific features of how they lived uh their historical ways of communicating and so forth
you know one of the things i've become aware of and i'll stop blathering here in just a moment
about um indigenous languages and the relationship between speech and interiority in indigenous peoples
they were clearly in in the cases that i've come across anyway particularly in the black foot in the
navajo they were clearly aware of a problem with representing identity they knew that was a very dangerous
thing to do and so it was not merely traditional but practically obligatory to negotiate identity rather
than declare it and this is a very different way of seeing thinking and speaking than the ways we are
familiar with because we just we just say what that is that's joe i know what joe i know who joe is
every time i see joe it's the same joe that was not the case in indigenous languages at all we who someone
was was a feature of from whom they are coming like who who do they represent in this moment
and many other features that we don't even have language about um but yes i do have you know one of
the complex parts of my own strange experience was a long education about letter forms where they came
from sound forms what they mean together but um in in our emails uh use you sometimes mention the muse
which i think you're referring to probably you caught this term from almond i'm guessing
well no actually um the the muse predates uh predates that quite a bit but uh so so i actually
i guess i saw almond first on uh gnostic informant i don't know if you've ever watched
that oh yeah and and and unfortunately they've they've they've seemed to disagree at some point
on things for whatever reason i i won't get into their disagreements so i i still find both of them
them educational on on different matters so so do i uh the disagreement according to gnostic was simply
that uh gnostic informant does not believe that the septuagint predated the hebrew bible
that's the point of dissent between them yeah as far as i can understand it i have my own thoughts
from my own perspective on some of this stuff but uh but if you want to talk about the the muse i i uh
uh so i've had what what people would call you know precognitive dreams and in my wife's culture
they're they're a little bit superstitious despite having endured uh decades of communism they're they're
quite uh you know not specifically religious but uh you know they believe in reading dreams they believe
in a lot of uh quirky superstitions when i was first over there i tried to with my limited russian
buy a dozen roses and that was completely taboo because an even number is for dead people and so
you're supposed to have nine roses and the woman selling roses would not sell me 12 roses for nothing
and i i kept repeating the same phrase and i'm sure i was right with you know what i was saying but
finally i just bought nine and i i didn't know that these so that there's a lot of weird traditions
and they're and they're different than ours which is kind of interesting i mean that one in particular
is very important because um it was made clear to me in my own so
evenness and completion to render something complete these are problematical features of human behavior
all right so i can i relate in my own way very deeply to what the inspiration underlying their
refusal to sell complete you know like even numbers of flowers and so forth you know the the origins of
what those things came from and then another thing that uh that i find fascinating about almond is that
while i'm in the crimea i i go to so i go to these caves that were you know easily 8 000 years old and
i i'm asking people you know who are these people and and what are these you know ancient ruins from and
what was this port city and they keep telling me about the skeifs which sounds like s-k-e-f and they and
they kept saying skeif and i was like oh and who are they and they said they said well they're kind of like the
the greeks but no one seemed to know what was going on and of course they're the scythians
and so the port that they're right at was the was one of these scythian harbors and uh as i've learned
more about the scythians i go and tell my wife you know what the scythian you know and all the weird
things that that uh you know uh almond's obsession with the the scythian women is is part of my daily
life so i i live i live the experience uh that's brilliant without the poison arrow necessarily but
a lot of the quirks showed up but i always wondered like when i started looking at some of the russian
stuff and i would bother my wife endlessly and she'd be like oh go away go away because she
doesn't want to explain her language any more than i want to explain english to her
but sometimes i'll catch her on a word puzzle and be like oh yeah i bet the word for to cut
has a z in it and she goes well how do you know that i go does it she goes yes and i was like well
okay and that's what you know i i understand what it's coming from and and it works perfectly and then
she's sort of impressed by that but but uh and i i will get sidetracked very easily but to stick with
the muse uh specifically
so she believes in some of these things but you know she's also uh you know she went through medical
school so she really is the uh she really is medea in a way but uh oh by the way i mean almonds
she's ex-wife was an anesthesiologist and tried to poison their two children
yeah i i actually heard that from some podcasts and i and i felt
weirdly uh disgusted by the guy that the west guy that uh posted that stuff because i i've uh i was
like you know no matter how much you dislike someone you really shouldn't
drag them through the internet mud like that but oh oh we agree about that but that comes from the um
so that comes from you know i don't think this is something almond would hide um it comes from a
i can't recall the word for when a lawyer takes uh yeah the deposition it comes from the deposition
right he he mentions it in the deposition um and i'm sure this is a matter of some you know pain for
him um all i'm trying to say is i'm certainly not trying to drag anyone into the mud or defame anyone
but it was just almond clearly has a kind of a mythic historical relationship situation that
deeply resembles features of of medea
yeah yeah i just i just uh having been through a deposition on my myself it's uh
only those who've been through them understand how how how how they can be
yeah no i i think what they did in that was um egregiously if not vicious close
well i just i just saw with the the the guy who put it up and i don't watch his stuff because
he's in a different a different a different uh cult than i am and uh but just understanding that
that this this uh what a wes huffman i think was his name who posted it that i saw it and he
i realized that he hasn't suffered through one of those experiences because if you had you wouldn't
you would have empathy for anyone that had yeah you wouldn't bring it up and so he hasn't he didn't
he did he doesn't understand what that that was no well i mean if somebody let's be clear if it's
someone's um initial goal to defame another human being well already you know where's the basis for
trust in that like what's what's up with this person i merely brought it up because i think there's
a there's a mythic background to hillman's um perspectives and orientations and so forth that's
quite profound and human and alive uh and i'm you know i find hillman uh fascinating uh and very rare
kind of human being well he looks at things you know in a very unique way and even if you disagree
with any individual thing he says his perspective is you know if you have someone way over there
looking at something they may see things you know you might see the cup as a square somebody else might
see it as a circle but it's really a you know three-dimensional object and and another perspective
might be just what some people could use but yeah you know uh hillman is a prodigy and he is uh in the
greek in my view anyway he's what could be understood as manis thigh right he is uh
uh he speaks from the spirit of enthusiasm this is very uncommon to find this you find people
emulating it all the time in christianity hillman's not emulating it right he's not playing a game
that i can see anyway so he's a very rare um kind of human being uh and i i find his work fascinating i
don't have to agree i don't i don't have to judge what he says to find his work valuable and profound
it's not necessary those two things don't have to go together for me
um but i want to return to this concept of the muse and and it's meaning it's meaning for you
so because my wife takes the dream analysis
somewhat serious you know in a kind of a a hobbyist you know some people believe in this
stuff some people don't i i am actually much more she's very skeptical about a lot of stuff
but in terms of that stuff even things that happened to me i would be skeptical because
if you it's very easy to fool yourself that you've oh i saw this in a dream so what i would do and and
this is a pattern that uh i'll just i'll just give you one story because i i think it's undisputable
that it's something weird and so it's certainly not the first go around for us but
often on the first night of a vacation and i've heard from other people that said that
on the first when you're when you're in a different environment sometimes your brain is a little more
aware or you're open to new new you know new things or you know your brain is working if you're in a
routine maybe you're boring you don't have anything interesting going on and uh so if i have an interesting
dream the first night of a vacation i i i'll i'll and it's always at a at a certain time usually but
of course if you're on vacation sometimes you're a little bit uh jet lagged or or you've been traveling
so we went to uh san diego over on your coast and this was a few years back and i had this dream and i
told her and it's a pretty weird dream and i usually argue with whoever's telling me things in the dream
as as i am the skeptic and the first part of the dream was there was a house and i i was building
the house for this person and they had an entirely glass foundation and i just told them you you can't
have a house with a glass foundation that's that's absolutely ridiculous how do we bet you know and and
so i'm arguing with this but then the dream goes on and i and i go to this park and there's this green bench
and there's these little black dogs and there's multiple ones and they have no legs and i pick one
up and it's kind of grumpy with me and i set it back down and i and i said hey those those legless dogs
are kind of mean and and so i told her that in the morning and of course there's no way to make much
sense of all that because it doesn't really make sense and we go for a walk and we're staying
just north of uh or just south of la jolla on the beach there and we walk along the beach and she
sees a dog that's like a corgi and she said well that dog has almost no legs and so my wife is kind of
you know laughing at me about the dream but i said well you know that's a that's a white it was a
whitish dog and it still had legs it just didn't fit right and so we walk up the cliffs and decide to
come back along the uh you know there's these big fancy houses up on the cliffs and uh you know la jolla
is pretty schmancy and uh we were looking at these whatever i think 10 million dollars wouldn't even get
you a garage up there but uh and we come to this house and it has a three-foot moat around it
of concrete wall and the entire foundation is glass all of it below grade it is the most odd thing i've
never seen it uh there's actually a second house we found on the same walk that clearly by the same
architect and what they did was they just gapped the foundation wall three feet out and made a you
know a 10 foot high concrete wall straight down and the entire foundation was glass panels
looking out at this concrete wall and you know as as a builder i would say that can't happen but
when i see it i go oh that's and my wife's like blown away because that's exactly what i told her and
because i you know it's it's not something that i could fool myself that i thought of it later so she's
the kind of the objective uh observer yeah i mean the chance there's i mean there's so many problems
with how humans think i find it interesting that you classify yourself as a skeptic
um it's very complicated this matter because
in my own research into human cognition and so forth
um often humans will make comments about what someone believes or doesn't believe
and um in my own experience and in my own sort of quest for understanding and insight
belief is most commonly an obstacle it's not a functional thing it's a thing we do to protect
ourselves mostly from stuff that we don't understand it's like oh i believe that or i don't believe
that and the things that we make decisions about this with in other words the architecture of the
cognition that we use to determine whether we believe something or not is mostly garbage
in almost every case we just don't look at it right we don't look at it it's similar to our houses
right we live in boxes that evicts ambiguity having the ambiguity evicted lowers the vigilance floor
right the less ambiguity we have the less unpredictability we have the less we have to pay
attention and humans are famous for doing stuff that evicts ambiguity to lower the vigilance floor
right in my room nothing changes there's nothing moving in here there's not one living thing in
here other than i've got a plan right nothing moves nothing changes if something does change i can
immediately tell like wait that's out of place we live in boxes and that's weird um and most of the
ways we are trained to think are the result of living in those boxes it's interesting what you said about
um if if one travels excuse me then the mind may open up and part of the reason the mind may open
is because we are not in a familiar box right even if we're still in a bot like we're in a hotel or
wherever we are it's an unfamiliar box and so we don't actually know what to expect um i remember watching
so in terms of like precognitive dreams that's just a straight up real thing i mean it's as real as the
sun rising in the sky people don't believe in it i don't care what they believe i don't care at all
yeah it's like saying i don't believe in cars or something right it's just like go ahead don't believe
i don't care um it may be that dreams are so dreams are really complex they don't just serve a single
purpose but it's uh it's precognition is built into the dreaming um mode of awareness and humans think
things like that's impossible to know the future you can't do that go ahead and think that be my guest
right you can think fish are dry you know the desert is wet think whatever you like right i don't care
um a lot of the time skepticism just protects us it's it's a sort of defense mechanism from things
that we would find would threaten our ontology right our world picture our picture of what
what is real what isn't real and so forth and on the one hand there certainly are delusions right humans
have delusions right that's a fact okay however what they don't do the accounting for
is how much of of the eviction of what is real and accessible to humans is delusional because
although there are delusions over here and those can be dangerous this delusion over here of evicting
things you don't understand is catastrophically more common and monumental than then you know this
one over here right so people are like i don't want to think things that could be crazy
crazy on the other hand most of your thinking is crazily non-creative uninspired not you but you
know yeah common thought is like living in you know the tip of one's pinky of your body or something
it's just ridiculous and this this little thing is going well that's delusional yeah go ahead you
know believe the monster right it wants to you know it it's terrified that it'll be dethroned by
something resembling living insight and when i think of the muse um although i don't yet know exactly what
you mean by that um for me i know there are beings i know the same way i know that water is wet
in my like if i drink some there are beings that are they are non-physical beings and they are pure
insight they don't have judgments they don't have like uh delusions they are pure insight and i'm
pretty sure our minds are their children
but we don't have that experience most of the time because
we got the 12 roses problem the structure dead structure overwhelms the aspect that can sense
and yet light leaks in and we become curious about things like alphabets
well i've become curious about lots of things and and as a uh i guess as an innkeeper i become
more and more curious but the second half of that story was that i i saw legless dogs and that seems
like a a rare thing so i don't know where in the east coast or west coast you are but uh if you go
on the other side of la jolla we went to some cave and we came out and there's this horrible racket of
barking and we went down to the beach and there was a sleeping sea lion and everyone was kind of
taking pictures with it and the water was up to where the you couldn't get back out the stairs without
getting wet we were just in our you know regular street shoes so we weren't prepared to get wet but
there were other a couple other tourists there and so this this sea lion was there just sleeping in the
sun and not moving and this other sea lion comes out of the water screams at it and then they kind
of do a little battle and the other sea lion pushes that sea lion out and so now this this sea lion that
has been pushed out looks at us and there was there was like maybe eight or so people in this little
group on the beach were kind of just trapped there and chases us in kind of slow motion yeah i have i have
real black bears here so it's not really they're very similar but uh and i'm looking at this thing
as it's chasing us at you know two and a half miles an hour going across the the beach and and my wife
both we both go that's a legless dog it's a leg i was hoping you were gonna get to that it's also black
right yeah i know it was exactly what i'd what i but my brain in the dream is trying to compartmentalize
information that i don't necessarily have an image for right so see i find this very peculiar about
humans they will have experiences that are blatantly non-ordinary right because
it's supposed to be quote unquote supposed to be impossible to directly correctly sense the future
the future yet this clearly occurred to you and at the same time it doesn't appear to have
muchly affected your skepticism or your ontology you saw into time for sure
i saw into time in a short span which is actually easier than the dreams that you have if you had a
dream that happens seven years later even if you remember that dream your ability to say aha correlate
it yeah but if it happens within 24 hours or 12 hours even of your dream all of it unfolds to two
seemingly impossible scenarios unfold within one day and you've already seemingly impossible to the
aspect of consciousness that in a material world that's impossible no no it's not impossible it's
just humans like to say that yeah but what's the only thing there's nothing to do with possibility or
impossibility right humans just say things they just make up and they go like well that's how the world is
within the cargo cult i guess it doesn't yeah exactly who cares like i mean i do care because um it's
blinding it's blinding and it's cruel we should not teach our children absurd things about the
predictability or normativity of the world or being human that's vicious in my view it's crippling it's
wrong um i remember seeing so certainly i've had you know precognitive dreams um i've also had intuitions
about the future i mean i have other experiences that are much deeper than those that i'll not
bother you with but um there's a gentleman i can't recall his name at the moment
or necessarily where i saw him it might have been on danny jones he's been researching precognitive
dreams for many many years and has gathered a lot of evidence um in favor not just of the fact that
precognitive dreams exist he's actually declaring that all dreams are precognitive we just the problem
the reason that we don't realize they're precognitive is because their their coding doesn't always
sometimes it's a bit too obscure for us to make the links right um but your dream seems blatantly obvious
and yeah and that's just one dream right and and i use that one because it had no effect on me
personally uh-huh in that nothing happened there's other dreams that were you know i i saw my wife
i've seen i told my wife what what our children would look like before they were born including their
hair color and and and certain events that were so repeated that it's like okay is that yes that's it
okay and it's almost boring when it happens but it's uh you know we we've we've had these discussions
you know for our you know we've been married for i should know 21 years now and and uh so we've gone
through a lot of this stuff from from being i you know i understand what other people would say
because i've had these discussions with people who if you don't see these things it's very hard to
convince somebody that it happens and once you do it depends it depends on who you talk to william
it depends on who you talk to it's it's hard to convince um people who live in boxes that there
are circles yeah sure and so you have to understand their point of view too that if they don't see it
or they they can't see it for whatever reason um i mean they can't see the kremlin but they believe it
exists right like yeah there's all kinds of things they have never seen that they believe quote unquote
exists why should they be so skeptical about these specific things obviously there's something
threatening here or right there's a problem of some kind but i i just find it interesting that
you describe yourself as a skeptic even though you've clearly had experiences that are non-ordinary
that are effectively irrefutable i mean the dream you describe there's no chance there's no way i can
possibly understand that as a mere coincidence right it's it's too blatantly obviously direct seems to me
and that's why i like that story because it's kind of silly and yeah it is it's great i love the legless
dog part that's awesome the legless dogs is not anything i would come up with but then i've noticed
weird patterns like that in language also where if you if you think about it longer you'll find out that
you know even in like akkadian that their word for uh a pigeon and i can't remember what it was but it
literally translated out as uh poop in the street right and it's just like you know people will make
up weird names and it if you if you just understood that the word was poop in the street you might not
oh and then you see it's a pigeon oh okay you you only get it after a lot of what we you you i don't know
it's it's like a puzzle that you don't see when once you see it you get it but if if you don't see
it you don't see it it's even within language the aspect of human okay so first of all unfortunately
at least in english we rarely make up words you apologized for having made up a word a little
earlier in the conversation if i recall you said something like it it's arrogant of me
to have made up this word alpha glyphics i don't know why you thought that was arrogant
particularly but i want to mention something that i think is very important there's a certain phase
in childhood in which we are like much more likely to invent words and particularly to invent private
lexicals with our close companions we did this as a child in my peer groups probably most commonly
between the ages of six and perhaps eleven um because we speak english and english is a relatively
non-neologizing non-word making language most of us don't have an experience of neologizing hillman
talks about neologizing in greek and is deeply aware that it's important for you to be able to make
words yourself um because of my experience as a writer and someone fascinating by by linguistics i
do neologize somewhat regularly not in common conversation only if i'm trying to come up with
a way to communicate about a topic that we're missing a word for but there are languages that
are natively neologizing i think german is one of them right it's it's a language of particles that you
can sort of just they're a bit like legos right if if i understand correctly yeah it keeps getting
longer you get those super long right yeah yeah so that's a naturally neologizing language but i don't
think there was anything arrogant about your uh inventing of the phrase alphaglyphics and i think you're
you're fundamentally on to something there's a couple more things i want to mention
before i stop um frothing at the mouth here so one of them is that the aspects of human consciousness
or awareness that are involved in the creation of language they aren't fundamentally non-ordinary
they're not like things you can think they're not like thinking they have deep poetic and um
um what is the right word uh prosaic pro the prosody they have deep senses of prosody poetics um
uh similar sounds rhyme all these things much like the dreaming mind right they're not usually um
i think it might even be impossible for them to be simply pragmatic
right even though we can find examples that look relatively pragmatic in uh word structure phoneme
use and so forth so yeah there's there's like this there's like a hidden intelligence here and it if
we want contact with that intelligence i guess the greeks would probably have referred to it as the logos
um there's an intelligence from which the possibility of things like letters and phonemes and words
arises the humans don't believe in that they don't believe in that i don't know something like that
humans just make up words yeah of course right they're just down there making up yeah no
there's no way of doing that in fact it would be impossible to make anything if the sun wasn't there
the humans don't believe there's an origin for things good for them right the thing they're not
believing with has an origin right there in the sky no sun no thing you're believing things with
right so this idea that like origin isn't real or doesn't matter we can't contact it or it's just
you know made up is insane anyway so yeah these these features there's a there's an intelligence
an array of intelligences involved in the history um and the origination of languages
writing and so forth and it's uniquely instanced in every people in time and time but that fingerprint
is always recognizable and i think this is what you're on to you sense that fingerprint
that's that's when you when you started talking about that i don't know if almond sees it that way
i think that he
he sometimes criticizes the hebrew
uh i i don't know necessarily to be defensive of the hebrew but there's there's some interesting
things that happens in the hebrew i just want to say something brief about that and then
i'll i'll ask you to continue so
almond's correct to a degree when he says you know there were only 8 000 hebrew words the greeks had
300 000 words you know who was doing the right where's the medicine no there's nothing there's nothing
there right he'll say and he's right about that but he's overlooking something which is that
that at a certain point in history things flip over right and then the hebrew becomes astonishingly
sophisticated so both things are true it's not now it's only the greek right the greek that's that's
that's true over an epoch but there's a overlapping epoch where the hebrew rises into incredible
sophistication so yeah please please go on and i'm certainly not a hebrew expert i i uh like i
say i started in english and and then did some other different languages that i was looking at
i'm a bit of a hebrew expert but when i started looking at the hebrew at you know at first when i
tried to learn a little bit of hebrew it's a little daunting with you know it's a little challenging at
first but then i went to some other languages and then i i i kept i i came back to the hebrew after
looking at the acadian which and to me the acadian and i i didn't look at it for a long long time
because it just seemed you know it's it's a challenging one and i didn't find any good
translations until uh for a while but anyway i i started looking at it and i'm like oh i keep
i keep understanding what the word is before i i can i can read this stuff just basically basically
using the pattern that i that i already know from looking at language this language makes sense so i
would say about 25 of the words in acadian make sense to me in in what they mean versus what the
letters i think they should mean which may not mean much to other people but when you look at the
hebrew and you finally and i finally was like okay i think that they created the hebrew from acadian and
aramaic with a filter and the filter being the words had to make sense to the letters that are contained
in them and if you said okay you have you know a hundred thousand words in english or i think it's
175 000 words in english but then you said okay well use your alphaglyphics uh filter to to just get
words that that fit with what you think would be you know that okay here's a really good word because
it means these these you know and a very simple example would be what i i think i i emailed to you was
um the idea of a fractal word and i and i i don't know if you're familiar with fractals but the the
small part is the same as the big part and so like if you look in the hebrew the word bet is house and
the word b or letter b is house and so you already have house within there the rest of the words kind
of irrelevant the r is the head the the you know the the symbol for the head and rosh rosh whichever
and this these are these are also all uh akkadian words but some akkadian words don't seem to make
any sense and probably people just on the street made them up and uh it meant you know whatever it
needed to mean at the time and it didn't have a reason it you know it wasn't following rules
which is what happens when everyone just uses them but if you're creating a and i'm not sure
when hebrew you know people will argue when the oldest hebrew is is around i think the most of it
came after the babylonian uh exile or whatever which was around i guess 600 bc i'll i'll say and so
we don't really have any writing before that so we don't have a sense that there's this organic language
growing from nothing but then they were going to create a language and they wanted the language
to look like the original source code whatever that might be and i think if they went through the
older versions because aramaic is not as it doesn't fit the pattern that i like as well as the akkadian
does so it's evolving away from the pattern i think somebody back then recognized this same pattern
use that to find words that would fit that pattern and created a language and a bible using
trying to make it fit into these these words that the letters within the words actually mean what the
word is and it happens almost all the time and in hebrew so much so that it it is it seems intentional
it might not okay that i i get it i get what you're saying it seems like it was done on purpose
however i think we should at least entertain the possibility that it was
very unlikely to do it any other way
right um to do it in another way would mean that abstraction would have to prevail over intuition
right like the meaning of
so that letters have meaning is for most english speakers a weird idea for people who speak hebrew
or arabic or um you know there must be many other languages in which the letters have meaning
but letters in english have meanings in fact they're very similar to the meanings that we might get from
greek or hebrew um i'm sure you're aware i mean i know that you're aware from reading you know some of
some of your work that this the shapes of the letters even have meanings right that's the yeah yeah
so what i what i heard you saying is that
at some point in history when for example the bible was being written in hebrew
there was an attempt even i think attempts the wrong wrong word it was natural for them to forge
huh yeah see there's a problem here and the problem is that um
it's it's territory that i don't fully
claim to to understand but i just see that the pattern there is
you know too strong to be coincidental yeah yeah it's not arbitrary not by a long shot the thing i was
thinking is um it was not on the one hand we could say it's natural for them to form words
in which the meanings of the letters contribute their spirit to the word itself but the problem with
that is that the speech the words existed before the alphabets right there was speaking hebrew long
before there was writing hebrew and the indigenous languages had no writing whatsoever
many of them right there was no alphabet they didn't spell things they just spoke them
there was no spelling for you know
no spelling for this until later when uh the blackfoot people were colonized and they you know
know acquired the english alphabet i mean there's a huge mystery here and it goes back to something
like see i i'm gonna just be i won't blather on but i'm gonna be i'll say something very brief and simple
i would be absolutely shocked if i discovered if i could travel back eight ten thousand years ago
and i found humans without non-ordinary intelligences linked to their minds moment to moment
the way we live i don't think there were any humans like that we don't know what it is to be human
because we do not experience some it would it's similar to um flowers that live on a world without bees
like we were born to relate with bees but we don't know they exist we don't believe in bees
right we don't think there's things that you know put the pollen between the minds right we just
don't think there are such things which is really like fish not having never encountered water or
something it's it's so fundamental to what it is to be human in my view that it's very shocking to be
without it and so it seems clear to me that the languages were attempts to do something similar to
what those experiences of transmission caused in our awareness and when that disappeared
then we had to make figures right shapes and light i mean the other weird thing about letters is just
think about this really bizarre feature of them they shape light to cross time and space into other minds
right this is their function right they they they shape light to cross time and space
that's a very weird thing to try to do
i i i think the the bee thing is actually a very good analogy and it took a long time for me
to come around to the to the so there's multiple like when i started seeing things in the japanese
i thought that that was nonsense because they don't they don't have letters they have kanjis
and as far as i'm told oh those are language isolates they didn't have contact
with the you know and yet there's words in there and i have just you know there's words and i i don't
have all this list in front of me but you can go through word by word and and say well that looks
an awful lot like the word for you know in hebrew or the word for you know you can see these parallels
and i thought well that's just can't be right and then i started when i you know i i showed you that
one example where the you know i i went through the word uh nakasendo because it's this it's this
trail and i would like to go there one day and i just like well they they someone said what it meant
and they said it meant trail through the mountains or something like that and there there's no word
for mountain and there's no real word for you know and it's like wait a minute that's probably not
what it does mean but then i i started breaking it up and i don't know what a japanese person would even
say it means because a lot of times these translations don't you know you'll say it means this or that
but it it doesn't really encompass either of those words sometimes and so sometimes the translation is
you know you hear lost in translation and i started looking at the word uh shima in japanese
now shima shows up all over the place but uh you know in japanese um if you look it up it'll it'll say
it means island and they can also paraphrase yeah change the sh to a j uh that's where iwo jima jima means
island except there's a bunch of places called shima and they're not islands and so there's a bunch of
towns called shima but it's not an island and when i look at it through my analysis the sh uh
in a kind of verb sense the sh is to divide
do you do you see that and so and the ma you can speak any language you want except you know we've we've
reversed the m to w in our silly northern language but uh ma is water in arabic and all throughout
africa you know amanzi and is it you know in the zulu language uh you can go to the cherokee and ask
them what water is and they'll go ama okay and it also means milk
uh and it basically just means all the liquids and we get it in marine and other things in english it's
all over english we don't we don't necessarily say we're completely aware of it but you see an m it's
got to be something it could be blood it's a lot of times blood uh but it's a liquid in those categories
and so if you say that uh you know island is divided by water
it's it's land divided by water if you go to any of these towns they're also divided by a river
yeah yeah yeah yeah this is great yeah and so and so they're they're saying the same thing
yeah but it doesn't mean sometimes it means island what we would say in english is island
uh-huh but it really just means divided by water and it could just be that a big river goes through
most towns actually have a big river in them so you can there's all these shimas that are
you know like harashima and other shimas that are they're not islands they're divided by a river
yeah yeah and so now nightmare basically means like bad water
water right that mare is water yeah all right and the mare and horse is actually because they were
milking them oh really yeah yeah and that's and that's where you get yeah it's like dark milk or
something right like black milk or something no it doesn't have it doesn't have to be milk it's just
a liquid but when you call you call a female horse a mare the mare is because they would milk the the
horses in original times but it's also it's like ma re ma re right it's so it's like that water but
with re and that re i mean i would argue and this is a very simplistic um i'm using a very simplistic toy
here but that ma is origin and the re is radiates energy right just literally re are
radiate e new things come out right children ma re right so these letters it's not that they have
in the way that i think in my view anyway in my current view it's not that they have explicit
always the same thing meanings rather it is that principles
are obviously associated with the letters it's not an accident that radio radar radius these things
they're about transmission and reception right it's there's no way that that's just arbitrarily
accident oh that's just you know how it turned out no one no one try it's probably true that no one
tried to make that happen go ahead well in your radio term i've never thought about this word before
but we have the letter d which as you know from your i don't know if you took uh in your karate the
dough the dojo dough is the way so if you have the way of radiating in your radio you i mean it's much
worse it's like r radiate a first principle d to distribute i selves o the universe over all spaces
right it's blatantly obvious like there's things in our language that we are not trained to look for
therefore we are likely to dismiss them at first glance even if someone presents them to us
and i was just again i'm i'm not even using complex analysis here i'm making something that's very
toy like that i could give to children right and they'd be like oh right i'm not trying to show i'm
not trying to prove my work or give you the calculus of the letters right i'm just showing that there's
something fundamental in the sounds and the shapes of the letters both
that they are not necessarily universal in the sense that they are explicitly instanced in all
languages but as you say the fingerprint is there or as you know this is my analogy right you can sense
the fingerprint and that fingerprint leads to something and it's repeatable and i and i was sure
that you know when i first looked at a few languages i started with i think algonquin and started going
through that and one of the one of the issues with the native american languages is that they have not
been written down for a very long time or i mean till till very recently so they were actually one thing
about it that's trippy is they were not collapsed into writing so most of them became written down
in like 1820s and which was actually long after contact with you know yeah the whited man and uh you
know the the uh i don't know if i mentioned that in one of the things but i started looking at uh
uh english because i realized i didn't understand english very well because i don't know how much
um words really mean what they mean and i i realized that i i am using what consensual you know
people are using for these words but when i when i uh you know when i studied and and worked for thomas
jefferson at monticello and i worked at poplar forest later which was his summer home that he
built while he was president uh you know i was reading his letters that he was writing to the
original carpenter to rebuild the building and you have to realize that thomas jefferson's
understanding of things is is different than ours he's using words that are fairly similar it's not that
far away but his concepts of things are slightly different than our concepts of things and
interestingly enough back back to the you know you said that uh um
we have different analogies using technology well of course in their in their time period god was the
watchmaker because the watch was kind of the height of technology that was when they first figured out you
know longitude and stuff like that you know got you got cook sailing around the world with this
idea this magical chronometer is now gonna you know so god was a watchmaker and now you have elon
musk saying you know god is a you know makes simulator games i prefer the old one so but we're always
analogizing it to some piece of technology right which may not be the best yeah it's maybe let me just
let me just interrupt that not only is it not the best it's blatantly you might as well just stick a
knife in your brain if you want analogies what you go to is nature yeah not machines right the earth
wasn't like swarming with machines when organisms arose we didn't find any here right we had to assemble
those from parts so if you want analogies that are intelligent and insightful you go to nature if you
want to get dumber you just substitute machines for natural processes that's my little lecture i'm
sorry but please continue well um if you don't mind getting completely sidetracked no let's go um
one of the earlier things in my little uh you know before i got into language
did you get my last email i sent you some images
i did and so i made this door that was gobekli tepe pillar 43 and kind of spent way too much time
with that carving it and got to understand it and the only way to understand something is to really
dig into it and if you can't draw it you don't understand it yes you have to do it with your hands
and i started realizing that everything that they did was intentional because when i carve something and
anybody else carve something you're kind of marking you're not going to make an error because you've
already scratched out what you're going to do with the chalk or you know charcoal or whatever they were
using at the time and then you're carving in stone which takes a long time i'm i'm a i'm a wood guy so i
do my wood uh you know versions of it but i still spent a long time looking at the the vulture it's it's
and and and and the and the note and the things above it really bothered me and uh it took me a long
time to really make sense of what they were but i was like they're intentional and so
it was sort of the start of what got me into the letter k because there's these there's these kind
of double v looking things and that some of them are upside down and some of them are right side up
and they just kind of make a a kind of i think a lot of people just see it as some sort of pattern
that's of no particular you know it's just uh some sort of basket weave pattern but yeah i don't care
about those people let's talk about what actually matters keep going i'm looking at the images right
now so because i spent a long time carving it i i i would occasionally go back and think about it and
i don't think i had the answer but at some point i feel like the answer was like hey dummy this is
this is math and and and uh then it became blatantly obvious and it's just one of the one of those
things that it's it's a hand and so a hand up is is five and a hand down is five and i think it's been
shortened to the if you if you look at the etruscan or the roman v is five in the you know roman numerals
and so this is an earlier version of that showing hands up and hands down each each being a unit of five
and and i knew right away and i went down and counted it because i i was fairly accurate on my
door and i looked at uh some other images as well um yeah the number is 72 which is this
number of the universe because that ends up being the the the zodiacal uh procession of the equinox moves
uh every 72 years it moves one one degree which ends up being one day a lot of times people explain
this more complicated than it needs to be but you know a degree is a day it's been changed to 360
because it's easier math but if you think of this is this is the clockwork you know they were
understanding the clockwork of the universe and of course we would give credit to some uh late greek
person for finally figuring out that the that the stars shift in in a certain rate based on this
uh procession of the equinox i mean this knowledge is so actually vastly older yeah than we suspect um
the santa lana and von decken wrote this book hamlet's mill that talks about this it's one of the most
amazing books i've ever seen it's truly astonishing hang on just a second here just want to adjust my cam a
little bit um so i'm looking at the image uh where in it is the hand that you speak of just help me see
or just above the the the bird's head is is a line of i'll call it uh numbers but it's it's a line of
up v's and down v's oh yes and when you when you suddenly realize that so if you look at the how
the etruscans would sometimes make their v's upside down so you would have an up facing v and a down
facing v and of course if you put the two v's together you get an x which would be 10.
uh and this is an earlier format of writing and then you get two extra digits at the end
uh which i don't think are accidental i think they're
intentional a lot of people would just say well they ran out of room but i don't i don't see that
as being a an issue when you're spending that much time carving something you would just adjust it
before you started cutting but uh yeah the idea that they were just um
goofing around with visually pleasing patterns is it's just not what was going on right in my view
so i think they were uh you know aware of a lot of stuff and and i think that would
go along with uh you know other people's assumptions and and then
i i i don't know why we want everyone to be
less intelligent and the history of of the earth to be so much shorter
i don't know if that makes it easier to understand or or make does that make us better or
well um i mean it's complicated so we suppose the part of the problem is the um
the appearance of mastery over the forces of nature that our machines give us i mean even the word us is
highly suspect because we're not an us in any meaningful way we're mostly just a bunch of
individuals unless a corporation captures a bunch of us and puts us to work for them
um in which case we're kind of like slaves but if you look at ancient architecture you know hillman
likes to um denigrate egypt and stuff you know he likes to yell at the pyramids and whatever which is
is fine i'm not tripping but um i've been studying uh the work of schwaller de lubitz and some of the
people who um condensed that work for more easy you know cons uh for for easier digestion so to speak
and it's wildly obvious that the egyptians were aware of principles of harmony in nature and by
harmony i don't mean things that go together i mean complex mathematical formula the harmonics the
harmonic frequencies that we that are involved in the generation of music and also in the generation of
language they were blatantly obviously aware of these things and this awareness has been
universally denied by egyptologists i mean it's it's demonstrably undeniable and the egyptologists
are still kind of like yeah that's just we don't we don't does anyone ever look at the you know did
you guys look no we don't need to look it's like the problem with galileo showing that the planets are
orbiting the sun he's like just look through the telescope we don't need to see what's in there
that's just you're just making stuff up then god moves the planets around you know i think um
one of the one of the uh medical professionals who first realized that the heart was moving blood
through the through the body when he when he told people you know it's pumping blood there were these
vast screeds against it now and i can't be a pump no one no one has ever heard a beating heart inside a
human body you know blah on and on and on they just didn't even look right the trenchancy of their
assumption of superior knowledge was so severe that it was effectively unshakable you had to just wait
till those people died right to get the knowledge to wait till they died because it's not gonna look
it seems to be in every field and i guess that goes back to the cargo cult
by the way this is part of what pisses off hillman yeah like the the fictions of the academy are
ridiculous and absurd and they're so entrenched that they'll just destroy you if you try to say anything
else you know um i'm really i think it's really brilliant that you did that carving because your capacity
to understand what's going on there when you do something with your hands if you recreate something
others have created it's a completely different possibility space for understanding than it is if
you try to think about it it's like go ahead think about kissing a girl be my guest think away you know
think about for the rest of your life you will never understand what it's like you know there's no
chance of you think about the flavor of a meal go ahead but yet this is what moderns are trained to
do they they seem to suspect that they can think about things and understand them it's not true you
have to do things to understand things right and that and that's what i you know had done and when i
worked at different museums and stuff like that that i was you know hands-on person so i've uh like i
built the skylight on poplar forest and and thomas jefferson designed it and he designed it uh you
know while he was president and he he made copies of these letters and people could people can read
about it people can but you know it's like i i understand what he was there's a certain hands-on
thing where you know how things are done because you've it's it's a big part of uh the debate in the
i guess in the archaeological or you know people who do work at museums there's the book people
versus the people who say well i know how they did that because i'm a human
and i only you know you can only do these in certain ways and this is a tree and they had trees
like there's only so many ways you can uh cut wood and if if you you know uh work with different things
uh you're gonna you're gonna come up with the same solution over time because you're working with the
the same the same wood in the same problems you're gonna you're gonna under you know you have to face
you have to have boots on the ground and actually do things it's a little disappointing the the the
pyramid stuff because very few of those people are uh physical people yeah i hand split shingles
uh at colonial williamsburg i i know how they're done i hand split siding i could i could tell you how
the uh you know how trees work because i've worked with them in ways that that you know a lot of people
used to work with but don't today and and i kind of understand it and in a different way than someone
else might theorize about it there's a certain it's like no no you do it you learn how you know
the wood will tell you what it needs to do and and how will it tell you it will tell you through your
hand by yeah and if you do it tell you yeah it won't tell you in your brain it's not something the
wood is not going to think to you it will tell you by the intimacy of touching it yeah shaping it
yeah eating with it physically relating with it this this is the thing you know intimacy i mean also
like the human hand this is the whole problem on this entire planet like there's nothing as dangerous
as that and there's nothing as liberating as this unfortunately we tend to sort of collapse down into
the danger part as humans but yeah this is the whole this is the most important thing going on
around here for a good you know 50 60 000 years minimum probably much longer um in terms of its impact
on life on this world right there's nothing more impactful than this in nature nothing not one thing
it changes everything it makes dead structure possible
i wonder if you might be willing to just take like a five minute break and then return how do you
how do you feel about that would that be all right yeah great see you in five i'm just gonna leave the
recording
you
you
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Amen.
Welcome back.
Good to be back.
It's such a pleasure to just be having this conversation.
Super fun.
I'm very, very glad to have the conversation with you.
It's been very interesting.
And I hope I don't know.
I have so many more things that I could tell you about, but I don't want to necessarily steer you in ways.
And if you have different things that you want to talk about or.
No, I mean, we're just we're just kind of getting to know each other, you know, and it's so wonderful because we've had these exchanges.
These exchanges in text through email and such, but to actually meet and speak together and talk about the things that we're passionate about and the puzzles and the quests that we've been on is super important.
And I think that's important.
And I have a bunch of questions for you that I haven't asked yet.
And I think that's the same problem.
And I think that's the same problem.
And I think that's the same problem I had with the interview with Amin.
I mean, I really I was hoping that we'd have a number of conversations.
I didn't actually get to the meet with him, but I don't I don't know if we'll actually if I'll be able to have another conversation with him.
But I want to show you something very basic here for a moment and talk about a couple of things about what, you know, ancient peoples were doing when they made what we call symbols, which is not what they were making.
So I was introduced through through being exposed to Amin, it led to a variety of introductions to other people.
And I'm going to be talking with Normandy Ellis next week, which I'm super excited about.
She studied hieroglyphs her entire, you know, for most of her adult life and is an absolute prodigy.
But another there are there are many, many women whose knowledge is it's just so different from men.
They're not egotistical.
They're they're like they're just alive with wonder.
So I was listening to an interview between Joanna Kuyawa, Dr. Kuyawa, and this guy, Chance Gardner, who made an incredible series about Egypt that's very difficult to get a hold of.
And he introduced me to this book, Serpent in the Sky by Anthony West.
This is the book I was talking about that condenses the work of Schwaller de Lubitz, who wrote this thousand page document called The Temple of Man that I'll I'll acquire shortly.
But I just want to show this particular thing here.
Let me see if I can get it in the camera reasonably.
So this structure right here is a harmonic diagram.
It's very difficult to see.
I know the camera probably doesn't reproduce it well.
Even in the book, it's not reproduced all that well.
But this diagram is used everywhere in Egyptian architecture, and it's not an accident.
There's no chance of it being an accident.
And this is one of the things that the Egyptologists are like, yeah, nah, it's just making stuff up.
Yeah, it's like, well, you could go measure the stuff, you know, and you'd see it everywhere.
So I find these things very fascinating.
But the thing that I was saying earlier, you know, hieroglyphs serve a very peculiar and fascinating aspect of writing.
And the thing that I think is lost on most people when they try to think about this is the concept of making shapes that change light.
When you do that, you're doing something that's not merely magical, it's transcendental to thought.
It's not a thinking thing.
Right?
You are actually shaping the fundamental sort of being that from which all things derive their origin and form.
You're shaping that.
And you're shaping it to be received, not just by human eyes.
Right?
We presume that all these things were just made for humans.
It's not that way.
Right?
So there's something fundamentally transcendental to rationality going on here.
And when rationality gets a hold of it, it just tries to dismiss it.
Like, yeah, it's not important.
You know, just blah, blah, blah.
And when you shape, it doesn't have to be letters.
Right?
It can be images.
It can be physical structure with wood or metal or stone or whatever it is your medium is.
You're shaping matter.
You're doing the same thing that the gods, whatever humans might mean by that, do.
So there's something very profound here that we should bear in our awareness when we pursue these matters, I think.
How did you first become aware of these matters with alphabets?
And particularly, how did you find your way into thinking about Akkadian?
Tell me the background.
Like, give me the backstory there, Will.
Well, some of the back, so the backstory on the door that I carved was that we had a, we've had actually a lot of interesting guests here.
And it's one of the more interesting things about being an innkeeper is that random people come with very interesting perspectives.
You would never know to look at them or imagine what you could never guess anyone's occupation.
So we've had people that cut down trees in the Panama, into the Panama Canal at 90 feet down.
That's a weird occupation.
Just all sorts of strange things.
And fairly early on, because we're near the Monroe Institute, which I'd never, I'd never heard of before, even though it's, I mean, I heard of it, but no one, no one locally in the county knows what they do.
But then we had a guy show up and I didn't know who he was, but he started telling me about, because, you know, we have this, this nice map that we'd just gotten, I think just before he got there.
And we had, I said, well, it'd be cool if people put their stickers where they're from and we could talk about travels and things like that.
And so his wife, he actually wasn't feeling that well the first night.
And his wife started telling me about all the places that they'd been, where she, she was from.
And so the person was Graham Hancock and his wife.
And I didn't know who he was at the time.
This was in 2017.
Right.
I'd never heard of him.
Uh huh.
Had no clue.
And then the next morning he proceeded to tell me, you know, about finding the lost Ark and, and all of his other, he's, he's been to almost every country and looked at, at so many immense things.
And, uh, there was another guest who'd been there, um, several other times.
She was an English professor at a university and she was working on a book and, uh, you know, so when Graham got up and left after breakfast to go, he, I guess they went to the Monroe Institute.
Uh, she was like, well, who is this guy?
Cause she was fascinated by him talking as well.
And I said, well, I said, you know, I said his name.
And so she looked him up on, on the, you know, Wikipedia and she looked at me and, you know, this is an English professor.
She goes, what's a pseudoscientist.
And, and, you know, Wikipedia was so cruel to him.
You know, nothing he told me was wrong.
He just actually come back from Russia and went to the Denisovan or Denisovan caves and interviewed the guy that, you know, discovered these, these things.
I'd never heard the word before in my life.
And he's pointing to the map exactly where these caves were, where he'd just come from.
And everything he told me, nothing was speculative.
We, we didn't talk about Atlantis, but, uh, you know, you know, everything that he told me was, was just, you know, here's, here's my travels.
And this is what I've seen.
And just, just fascinatingly energetic and, and, you know, very complimentary of the work that I did.
And, and, uh, you know, I, I do custom door, you know, weird doors.
I do lots of them and have different themes.
And so just very nice.
And his wife was just so amazingly nice.
It was the, it's the one thing that I tell people is like, yeah, he gets a lot of cruelty from the Egyptologists, but his wife is so nice that you really can't feel sorry for him that, you know, she's.
Uh, and, and then, and then of course they go on to call him, uh, later on, you know, I'm watching different things like Joe Rogan and other things.
And, and he's on there and they, you know, they're very critical of him and, and, uh, you know, they call him racist and other things.
And, and he's clearly, it's all just made up to try to detract from his, uh, and I, and I see much of this.
The, um, what, what, which fallacy is that right?
The straw man fallacy don't examine the claims.
Just attack the person.
I see that kind of parallel with him.
And, uh, to some way with, with almonds getting the same kind of criticizing the person and not looking at his, either his translations are right.
Or they're not right.
Or you think this should be changed or this should be more accented.
Okay.
Whatever.
But why, why pick on him?
Uh, you know, personally, I mean, I would, I would distinguish between Graham and almond in a specific way.
So Graham is in my view, um, a profoundly insightful, intelligent, brilliant, actually.
He's a prodigy, but he's a scholar and Hillman is a weirder thing.
He's a different animal, but, uh, Hillman is much more like a prophet.
Hillman's a prophet, right?
That's what he, that's his game.
In my view, I'm not, I'm not saying he would agree or that anyone should agree with me.
Um, but Hillman, Hillman is possessed, right?
He's possessed.
He'll straight up tell you that he sold his soul, right?
He is, he's a possessed human being and he's possessed almost by the spirits of ancient Greece.
Yeah.
He's like an avatar or something.
Right.
In my view.
Um, or at least that's one way to, to view him.
If people want to just examine him as a scholar, I'm sure they can find lots to complain about.
That doesn't really bother me because he's, he just seems like a very different animal to me.
Hillman is a transcendental thing, right?
He's, he's like a monster or a Medusa.
Yeah.
He's, he's a great, he's, you know, he's really something, but he's not a regular scholar.
Hill, uh, uh, Hancock's a scholar and he's brilliant.
Um, and they've risked their lives.
I mean, they've done incredible like dives off of Japan and other places, him and his
wife, you know, they put their lives on the line to try to understand, to see through the
lie of the academic fictions.
So I think he's wildly heroic.
It's astonishing that Wikipedia, it's not really Wikipedia.
That's the problem.
It's the, um, it's the Academy, right?
In that case, it's the Academy, but that's fascinating.
Okay.
So you met, um, Hancock and his wife and you were introduced to the Monroe Institute.
How did things go after what, what happened next?
So I met the, um, I guess it's the daughter of Bob Monroe came, came here to, to, to meet, to
meet with me and kind of get a little tour of the place.
And, uh, she invited me to go there at some point.
So that was after, uh, um, Graham Hancock had, had left and so forth.
So he stayed in, but, you know, each morning he just had his, you know, an hour long talk
about just some of the most fat, like he'd been everywhere.
He'd been, you know, shot at over Ethiopia in the airplanes.
And just, I mean, just, I was like, this is like, and he didn't even know how
he can cover like a 10th of what the things that he's done, but just, just his adventure,
like any subject you could come up with, he could just go.
And, uh, I realized I had to be more interesting.
So I, uh, I, I realized that there was, uh, there's levels to this game.
Hmm.
And, and, and, you know, when I was, uh, younger, a younger fitter person, I, I used to do,
uh, power lifting and, uh, competed and, and did very well, but the, uh, there's my ego coming out,
you know, but the, when you, when you, I met this Russian guy, um, in a, in a gym long ago.
And I was, you know, I lifted my certain ways and I had my, and he came over and asked me for a spot.
And, uh, he didn't look that big, but I was like, okay.
And he goes over the squat rack and he, he has 500 pounds in the bar.
I'm like, I don't know what this guy's going to even do.
He takes like six steps back into the middle of the gym away from the squat rack and starts doing what are called good mornings,
where you bend down and go vertical with your back or horizontal with your back and then back up.
And, uh, I was like, who are you?
What is this?
And then I start talking to this guy and, you know, he was raised from the age of 10 in the Olympic training center to be,
you know, he was just, and I learned so many things from him because he was operating at a different level,
uh, both mentally and physically.
And suddenly my, my training went from, you know, average gym bully to, you know, being able to compete at a high level,
you know, to, it's just a different, it's a different mindset.
And when you, it's almost like, uh, picking up a disease from someone when you meet somebody at that level.
And I've heard other people say that with, uh, specifically Graham Hancock.
When you, when you have time with him like that, it's not that I went down the rabbit hole.
I was pushed.
No, the rabbit hole comes inside you.
And so, and so things that I didn't pay attention to before, you know, it's, there are people that,
that change your ability to see things.
Yeah.
And I, I think legitimately you're one of those people as well.
So I would put you in that, that camp of, of, you know, what about, you know,
if you look at it this way and you're like, what?
And you never experienced that.
There's different ways of, of just different ways of seeing things.
It's part of why traveling is interesting as well.
Um, so that, that was, it was after that, that I made that door.
I was like, well, you know, I make these doors and I, and I, I had never even heard of Gobekli Tepe.
So this was 2017.
I'm sure I didn't heard the, had not heard the word Denise Devin at that point or Gobekli Tepe in my life.
And I felt kind of betrayed by the, uh, I think at that point I still watched.
Uh, I think we still had satellite and I, and I would watch the history channel, but the history channel, it was dying at that point.
And I felt, I felt betrayed by the history channel to have not shown me these things.
Uh, and this was cutting edge stuff.
I mean, he's, he's getting into the most cutting edge stuff and giving it to people.
And the academics are, who don't like him seem to think that there should be the arbitrators of what's, what's new and not, uh, you know, but I felt, I felt like, wait a minute, I'm not learning enough.
And I really got from that point into investigating other things, but, you know, so making the door was met, was more of a, an exercise in understanding it better.
And then I would, I would, you know, there's certain information that I, that I, that I, I would, I would say I come up with what other explanation would be.
It comes to me at three o'clock in the morning, fully formed.
I mean, does it ever occur to you will that, um, that information is not dead and that it might seek out a person who could express it into the physical world.
I, I would believe that now, but I think it, it earlier times I would not.
Okay.
So that, that's a,
because, you know, we have these weird ideas about like what information and knowledge are supposed to be and where they come from and stuff.
But if you look at those ideas, they don't hold water very well at all.
Also, I think it's fascinating what you say, because when you're exposed to somebody like Hancock or you go to the Monroe Institute,
there's something that occurs that I would call like the mixing of the waters.
Right.
As if those places and those people, they have a certain kind of magic water.
Right.
And you get some on you and you get some inside you and you can't help it.
And it just changes who it's possible for you to become.
Um, it, it, it, I think it, I think that's really, that's, I mean, that's the best way to describe things.
That's why I, you know, I was amazed how you just kind of sum things up.
But, uh, yeah, I mean, you, when you get exposed to the ability to see, you know, like, I, I don't know.
It just, it changed how I looked at certainly at ancient history and other things.
I, I have my, you know, I have too much Jefferson knowledge.
I could, you know, spend, I read, I read a bunch of books about him while I was working there and, and, uh, you know, fully entrenched myself in him.
But, uh, you know, getting into other fields, really just seeing, you know, seeing other time periods and other things.
And he's just like, there's so much on that and I became just an annoying 10 year old that wanted to know how everything works and how everything happens.
And, uh, yeah, good.
I think that's what he is.
I, and it's, it's very good to see somebody that he's just curious about everybody, very social, likes everybody.
Just kind of, what is this?
How, and that's kind of how you should travel as well.
You know, you shouldn't go places and go, ew, why did they do that?
But you're like, wow, that's the ugliest, weirdest looking motorcycle I've ever seen.
Where, how do I get you?
Like you just, or you see somebody doing anything and it's just, if it's different, it's exciting.
Yeah.
Um, so that got me, maybe, maybe using my mind a little bit more, but at some point within, this was a, on a, another vacation on the first day.
I woke up with, and, you know, Graham talks about a bunch of different stuff.
And I, and I had, had read a book of his, but this was now several years after that.
And, uh, I woke up with the idea fully explained to me.
Although I, I think there's an error in what I was told, uh, that I discovered, but, but anyway, that if you look at a Lotus, uh, which is, you know, the Egyptian Lotus.
They open and close and they do so.
And I had no knowledge of this.
There's no biology that I knew that would explain what I was understood.
Uh, that I, I have, you know, 10th grade biology.
I don't have anything to express this, but the time clock of the Lotus flower is not dependent on the sun.
And that if you took one with you on a ship, it would answer the problem of longitude.
Because it would keep its time to the original place for which it was grew.
Wow.
And you could compare it to wherever you were.
Cause you can, it's very easy to tell when noon is, but it's hard to tell when noon is in Cairo if you're a thousand miles away.
Right.
But the plant, the plant would know.
Now I, I, I began fascinated with that and there's a woman and I wrote her name down cause I had to go look it up.
Cause I, I, I didn't know if I would talk about this, but I couldn't even remember her name.
Cause it'd been so many years since I looked at this.
Her name is Monica Gagliano.
And I don't know in what weird research I found her, but she took mimosa plants and dropped them in a drop test and prove that over time they had a memory.
So the mimosa plant will curl its leaves in response to stress.
But if it gets repeated and then even cuttings of that would remember that this event that she created was not stressful.
And that they no longer reacted to this event and even offspring.
And, and then I looked up another guy who was a astronomer in France and he is the inventor or creator, I guess, of discover of the circadian rhythm.
And he was a, a, a astronomer in 1729.
He did this experiment where he took a similar plant and put it in a cave and noticed that it maintained its same pattern of opening and closing to the light, despite not having the light.
And showed that it, it, it, there was something else in the, in the, in the plant that had a natural rhythm independent of seeing the sun.
Yep.
And that was the, and he didn't publish it because he thought it was too silly.
And then his friend ended up publishing it for him because he, he worried, I guess the astronomers would laugh at him for his study of plants.
But it ends up being the foundation of what is, you know, circadian rhythm.
And it turns out, of course, we all have these natural rhythms and that's why you get jet lag and plants also get jet lag and, and all the, all the plants in the legume, the bean family are particular with their, their, their rhythms.
And so there was, I believe he was in Japan, a guy that was studying to see if you could alter the patterns of a soybean, because apparently it has a, it has a theoretical idea of how long a day should be in terms of the light.
And then it measured it against the actual amount of light it gets.
And that determines when it flowers and produces seeds.
And he was trying to cheat that to shorten the, the, the growth cycle so that you could get beans sooner.
And you could then get four crops instead of three or something like that.
And so the plants have a certain innate intelligence and clearly ancient people knew this, not just biologically for, for, you know, what it does to me and the mushrooms, but just that plants knew what was going on.
And I started reading about, I, I don't, I'm not sure where I stumbled into this, but there was a, Alexander the Great's, one of his generals wrote a book about plants.
Uh, I should know, I, well, I, I, I, I don't remember his name now, but he mentions a tree that he finds, which every day curls up his leaves and opens them in the morning.
And it's called the tamarind tree.
And when I read about that.
And I, you know, it, it took, this is over a period of time.
I said, that's it.
That's the plant.
That's the plant because I didn't think the Lotus would last long enough to be useful in a sea voyage.
Oh, right.
Right.
Then I went to the Richmond museum when we have a fine arts museum, which has some, some Egyptology stuff.
And it has the, the wall of it's a copy, but a copy of the wall.
Um, for Queen Habsepsu's fleet, if you can, you could look that up at some point.
And if you're going to talk to a hieroglyphics woman, perhaps you can profound her with this.
I talked to this weird guy and he thinks that, uh, if you look at the images, what the Egyptologists say is happening in the images is not what's happening in the images.
Nope.
It there, it's a, it's a, it's a whole wall.
It's like, you know, 50 feet long and, you know, 30 feet high.
And it shows, it shows them loading a boat with these plants that are about six feet tall.
And they say that at least the Egyptologists say that there, uh, that she went to essentially Eritrea, which is a day's walk away.
If you were going to just hoof it, it's not that it's the next country down and brought back.
Some, uh, myrrh trees for her eye shadow.
That is the conventional version of this scene that we're seeing.
And they're loading baboons and other things.
It's, it's, it's quite an involved story, but it seemed to me that they're using these trees because by, at the end of the story.
Picture wise, the trees have three splits in their branches and are considerably larger.
So it's, it was a long voyage.
It seems to indicate that they were gone for three years.
And it might be, it may not be, but it might be that they were using these.
Why else would you transport six foot high shrub rays onto your ship?
So my theory is if you took them and had them on the deck and covered, if you had what, let's say six of them and covered two of them, the difference in time.
Cause eventually the other ones are going to adjust to their time having been exposed to the sun.
So they'll, they'll get over it.
But the other one, the one in shade will, will maintain its jet lag and be different.
And the difference would tell you how far you are from your point of origin.
Hmm.
I see.
Yes.
There's a bunch of maps that people, and I didn't really get into the maps when I heard about it.
I was like, well, whatever, but they claim that they had Antarctica and other, there's, there's, there's claims of earlier maps.
Right.
Showing details that, you know, even Columbus would not have been able to convey.
Yeah.
This is something Hancock's onto as well.
And so that, uh, it's, it's a kind of wild theory that I.
It's not very wild.
Put forward.
It might seem, you know, superficially this way or that way, but the ancient peoples, particularly the Egyptians who we know about because they left, you know, they left us enough stuff to look at.
Um, they were aware of time in a very different way than we are and they synchronized their relationships.
Um, you know, your story about the Lotus is fascinating.
I was unaware of that.
And it's the first thing I thought was, Oh, God's a Lotus maker.
Oh, watch maker.
He makes lotuses.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You know, like the Lotus is a clock.
Go ahead.
Well, the Lotus is within it.
A computer that, that does everything that you're.
That's my point.
You know, Harrison clock is, is doing the same thing.
Yeah.
Except your, your clock won't relate with you.
And the Lotus will.
Right.
A Lotus is a living being, right?
A clock is just an object.
Um, I mean, there's so much to say here.
I've studied how, um, organisms hitchhike on each other's synchronization and activity.
And by studied, I mostly mean reflect on, and in some ways, excuse me, inquire into.
Um, but there's something else I want to ask you about.
Um, and perhaps we can wrap up fairly soon though.
I'd be happy to have an, another conversation sometime with you.
And I, I very much enjoy that.
Um, this door thing.
Did you, did I understand you correctly to say that you've, you've make doors?
Well, I built the, if, if you go to my, uh, in, I built the entire in.
Yes.
And so, and so one of the things that I did while I was, um, coming up with the plan and so forth.
And, and, uh, I started building.
So I, I, I built doors for like a historic place or something like that.
I could make a door in different time periods.
I could make it, you know, oh, the Dutch built this and they did the joinery this way.
Or the, you know, the English did it this way.
Yeah.
I mean, that's, that's, but within the time period that I, that I, you know, colonial America time period.
Hmm.
Uh, so I, I, I would consider myself at least knowledgeable in those, those kinds of things.
And, uh, you know, there's different tools that come in.
So the, the technology of the time is, it's, it's evolving in that time period.
It's, it's, to me, it's, I mean, I always found it interesting enough to work in that for a long time.
So that was, uh, that was my little niche of, uh, what I did, but then I wanted to make doors that I'd never seen before because the, the, you know, I wanted to create things that I, I liken it to, to music.
Not necessarily that I, I always have to explain to people that I, that I'm not that great at music.
Uh, but.
Um, when I was doing the work at a museum, it was classical music and now I do jazz.
Hmm.
In other words, and then people will question that.
I said, it took a little while to learn how to do jazz style, uh, building, or, you know, it's kind of like when I would build things, I had to think about how much Dr. Seuss do you want?
Not so much that it looks like, you know, you have to have a little bit of play to it.
Hmm.
It won't, it won't look handmade if you didn't, if you didn't, uh, you know, if it's too perfect, it's wrong.
And it, it has to do with like with the Japanese wabi-sabi concept.
Uh, but it, it occurs in other things.
I used to call it colonial funk when I was working at museums, but, uh, how, how funky should it be to be believable?
Believably handmade, even though you could make it perfect.
If you did, no one would think everyone would think a machine did it.
Right.
And that's where the machines have, have ruined, uh, many trades because the, the, the silversmith used to do that too.
He's like, I could make it round, but I can't sell it.
So he has to have it a little bit rough and we would knock the corners off our planes to leave marks on intentionally.
Wow.
To humanize it.
Well, to leave tool marks because the tool is, it, it, you see a similar thing that happened in, in the art world when photography came in, you, you had to have, uh, you know, it wasn't enough to be accurate.
That wasn't artistic anymore.
Mm-hmm.
Painting accurately was great when there were no cameras, but now you had a machine that can do it perfectly.
You have to come up, you have to have brush strokes.
Now you have to have abstraction.
You have to have Picasso.
And he was going back to the, the expression of, of what he thought was the earliest.
He was looking backwards to see what the earliest people were painting.
And he wanted that, that emotion.
He really liked the cave paintings when they found those in France.
He thought that was the bait, you know, that was as good as it could get because it's, it's, it's like, you can see the artist in it.
You can see the hand of the maker.
Yeah.
And if it's too perfect, you've lost, you've lost that feel.
And so if you're going to make a forgery or a, you know, a reproduction, I'll call it that way.
But if you're going to make any of these forgeries, they always have to recreate the time period that you're trying to create.
So if you go to Colonial Williamsburg, it wasn't all built in 1780.
Cause I built some of it.
And so, and then, you know, other people built a lot of, you know, so a lot of it's post-1930.
You'll see, but it's done in a way that you will generally not know it.
And it, it does reflect back into language that I think that's where Hebrew comes back around again, where it's, it's, it's a reproduction.
A recreation of earlier languages.
I don't think it's the language of the time.
I think it's the language of what they felt was closer to the, apparently closer to the gods or God or whatever.
Um, a way to origin.
Yeah.
Going back to the original kind of sense of the tower of Babylon.
Hmm.
It's a store thing.
I mean, are you familiar with the, um, the Greek idea of Janus?
The two faced God sits above the doorways, one face on one side, another face on the other.
I haven't looked into that much.
No.
Yeah.
Cause the door, I mean, the, to make a door is a very transcendental thing to do, right?
It's the, it's both the closure and the opening kind of between two worlds.
Well, from, for me, it was a, it was my two sides of my brain having a conflict because, because the creative side of my brain had been suppressed.
And the engineer side of the brain, the architect side of the brain looked at art and said, if it's on a wall, it has no job.
It's unemployed.
It has no function.
Wow.
Yeah.
And so if it was in a door, it has a job.
I see.
I see.
So it's not just the conflict.
This is where they, um, come together as well.
It's my internal conflict between the two sides.
And, and it took me a while of making doors to get to the point where I was like, I could do this just on a wall.
It doesn't have to open or close.
It doesn't have to move.
But, but there are people who have that, like, it has to have function or utility because they're, they're, you know, it's like, and we get that.
I get that with different guests.
When they ask me, they, they, you know, they'll ask me all sorts of questions about, you know, how did you come up with this?
Or why did you, you know, they, they have these questions and there are certain people who are artistic or poetic.
And they see that right away.
They like, oh, wow.
Yeah.
They see that just as clear as can be.
And there's other people that will ask you questions like about what's your ROI or, and they'll ask you numbers about, you know, these financial things.
And I, and I've, I've told some of them to, to know probably, uh, use, but perhaps maybe so.
I don't know.
I've been, you know, it's like, yes, but if you design everything by efficiency, you get a place.
No one wants to stay.
Yeah.
It's dead inside.
You have to have, I was like, you have, you have to have both because it has to work as a business, but it also has to be something that if you, if you just, you know, if it's too manufactured, too efficient, you see that with older businesses where they get too pragmatic with their approach and they go out of business.
Mm hmm.
Because I mean, fundamentally, we are animals.
And so if, if there's something in the space that feels uncomfortable, we will not want to be there.
And what makes comfort may be different for different people, but there's got to be a kind of an organic familiarity, I think, in shape and character and color and all kinds of things, right?
The lighting, everything mattered.
Yeah.
No, I'm, I'm quite worried about the utilitarian aspect because it's dangerously overemphasized in our, in most of our experience.
But yeah, both things, both things are necessary.
The danger of AI becoming too, yeah.
That's a rabbit hole we'll have to preserve for another time.
But yeah, I've, I've, I mean, I was, I was studying, I started to first think about AI in, in 1981, when I was a very young man and starting to play with computers.
I've been following that for a long time, but it's, yeah, it's extremely dangerous.
It might be the most dangerous thing, although the invention of automobiles is way up there and, and along with guns and so forth.
Those are really terrifying things as well.
But it's, it's, it's a, so the, the doors were kind of a, a way to open up, I guess, metaphorically, my own brain.
Um, um, um, a way to express things in a way that was still pragmatic.
Yeah.
I love that.
Um, you know, the, the, uh, Hebrew letter bait, uh, is the letter that represents house.
It's also, you know, the, the thing that we pick to say it represents tells more about us than it does the letter.
But it's very much like a room, which is also very much like a womb.
And the door is the, you know, determines who enters the room, the womb, who doesn't, when they do or don't.
Um, in a way to pass through a doorway is to be reincarnated or reborn.
Because the space inside the room transforms us and we transform it by entering and living within it.
Right.
So that door is a very profound transcendental object.
If, you know, if, if we reflect on that in, in any deep way.
Um, and also in the, so the letter D is the door in, in a lot of languages D is the door.
Yeah.
And the reason it's a triangle.
Um, is that it's from a, a, a tent door.
So it was from people that were moving.
And if you think about a door, it, it doesn't open the way a door today would open.
It's a square because it's a triangle.
It actually opens and goes up and it would be hinged on the right hand side.
So that as you left, you would be pushing it with your left hand.
As you left the tent, you'd be opening it with your left hand because you might have a knife in your right hand to, to defend yourself.
Just like in the castles, they were spiraled in a direction so that you were fighting at an advantage.
Hmm.
Wow.
Yeah.
That's, that's.
So the door, so the door, when it's paired, the letter D is paired with the letter R.
And I, I denote it for my own sake.
When it's a paired version of R, I use the lowercase.
It's, it's a little weird to explain, uh, at first, but it makes sense to me.
Hmm.
So when, when D is interacting with R, I know that the door is open.
It's a different door than when it's interacting with the letter N.
And I know the letter is let N when I write it in a lowercase, it's as an interactive N.
I know it's an end.
It's, it's, it's N, D and N are, are enclosed.
Mm hmm.
You might bind something or bond, or there's, there's ways that the, that the door is closed.
I see.
Yes.
Yes.
And D with R is open.
And then I realized that the N and the R can be applied to the letter K.
And I can have K with R or K with N.
And so if I go like into Japanese, a fist is Ken, K-N.
Uh, Kendo is the sword grabbing a knife.
Again, I'm grabbing in this case, the P is a stick.
And that's only in the English and in all other languages.
It ends up being usually a, a stone instead of a stick with the letter differences.
Hmm.
But it turns out that actually the word dagger is related to the word dogwood, which used to be dagger wood.
And they would make their, the English would make knives out of this hard wood because they didn't have a lot of metal working at the time.
So a, and you can get a very good sharp edge on a, on a piece of dogwood or dagger wood, as it was called.
That was what they would make the English short sword with a dagger is actually wooden.
Wow.
In England.
And, and, and our word knife has the different letter than, um, I believe in the Hebrew.
Um, it's Siken, so we have S and K over that could be the Arabic.
I've, I've looked at too many languages, but, uh, you have the, the S K N.
So you're grabbing a stone.
Mm-hmm.
And it's, it's, it, a lot of times the word order or letter order is almost irrelevant in a word.
And I started seeing that in Hebrew, particularly, um, I, I was watching a show that was supposed to help me learn Hebrew.
And it was a flashcard type thing.
Mm-hmm.
And they would show you the Hebrew as it's written in Hebrew.
Then they would show you.
what it sounded like.
Phonetically.
Mm-hmm.
And that reverses the order.
It's important.
But the, uh, um, and then they would tell you what that word means.
Okay.
And I'm eating breakfast or whatever I'm doing and trying to multitask.
And I, and I see this word and I'm trying to understand a little bit of Hebrew.
And I see, oh, I, I, I like the letter shin, you know, the, the, the show sound.
It's a good one.
It's my favorite.
And, uh, I see that and go, oh, that's, that's that.
And I go, I think the next one is R.
And I look and I think, I think that's the K.
Cause you know, the letters are hard to learn at first.
Hmm.
And I, I go S R K.
I was like, I learned, I learned a word that that's gotta be shark.
God damn it.
I'm, I'm sure of it.
And then the next section comes up and it goes Karish.
Like, oh, I read it backwards.
And then it shows me the meaning of Karish shark.
And I'm like, wait a minute.
And so if you, if you take out the vowels, the word reverses.
And it's the same word as shark.
And I'm like, what is it?
It was one of those things that, that made me look at words differently.
Yeah.
So there's a lot of mirrored words.
And so you have, uh, in the Akkadian, a chief is a rab, R A B.
Although we don't actually know the vowels in any of these just, um, and in the Hebrew,
it's bar, except they also have rabbi is chief.
Right.
Yeah.
I see this all, this, this all makes fundamental sense to me.
So there's mirrored letters or mirrored words that like Karish and shark.
If you take all the vowels out, it's, it's just, it, they're, they're mirroring the same concepts.
And yet I, I, I, I, they would, they would tell you they're unrelated and from different families and no one from here.
And then you can go into, you know, you can do that with a bunch of different words.
And, and, um, even into the Egyptian, into the words, you know, the, their, their words.
And you're like, well, uh, how come that makes, that looks like English to me.
Hey, wait a minute.
This can't be.
And so there's certain things that make sense when you look at it, even though they shouldn't be related.
Hmm.
Yeah.
Well, the idea of should and shouldn't again, comes mostly from people who don't want to look.
And if you don't go looking for something, then you won't see it.
And if you don't see it, then what you'll decide it doesn't exist.
I don't know.
It's just, it's just, it's really weird.
Again, it's a problem, not so much necessarily with rationality itself, but with the, I don't know.
I don't know where the actual problem comes from.
It exists all over the world.
So it can't just be American, but it's uniquely instanced in different places.
Um, some of it has to do with thinking style, right?
Just we're taught us a thinking style that is garbage, or we're so poorly educated as most people in America are, that, that our capacity for any kind of, um, insightful thinking is minimal at best.
Yeah.
And so Jefferson.
Oh, please.
Uh, Jefferson actually noticed this and I, I never paid attention to this, but there were, there were a couple of quirks that, uh, that Jefferson had, uh, linguistically that, um, that I reflect on now.
Uh, but kind of ignored at the time.
There were just things that, okay, whatever.
And so one of the things is that he told Lewis and Clark to, to learn a few Hebrew phrases, because he, he saw, he noticed that there were Hebrew words in certain Native American languages.
And he wanted to, he wondered if out West was somebody that actually just spoke some Hebrew.
How did he's wondering how these words got there.
Um, and most people see that as silly, but the, but the more I looked at it, I could find you Hebrew words, but they're not necessarily Hebrew words.
They're words that conform to the pattern.
Um, and they, they exist particularly in different tribes throughout South America, North America.
Um, you know, the word for water keeps being something with an M or some other version throughout South America.
You know, the different languages throughout Africa, it just pops up and you could say, well, that sounds very, you can see it in Hawaiian and other things.
You can keep seeing these same patterns where words look vaguely Hebrew, you know, not, not exactly Hebrew, but vaguely Hebrew.
And he was seeing that.
And the other thing he, he did was, was he began translating the, the Bible from Greek and he gets partway through.
And I've always been curious which part since I started watching Almond, but at some point Jefferson takes the Bible, the Greek Bible.
And, uh, he says enough of this.
And he takes a pair of scissors to the King James Bible and starts cutting it.
And he cuts out the passages that are basically, uh, I guess religious people would say is the Q document or the, you know, just the, the teachings of Jesus and none of the woo, none of the other stuff.
Hmm.
But, but a bit, a bit, uh, I don't think most people would, would say you should take a pair of scissors to a, uh, a Bible and start cutting out the parts that you like.
And, uh, but that's, that's the Jefferson Bible.
And I, and I've always been curious when he, what, what he saw when he was translating the Greek that, that got him to the point.
You know, I don't know where, what, what chapter he was on when he, uh, he, he said enough of this.
Hmm.
Hmm.
But it makes me wonder if he saw something like, uh, you know, Almond sees a lot of stuff in there that I don't know enough Greek to, uh, to speculate on these things, but.
I mean, it seems unlikely.
I think Almond's understanding of Greek is peculiar.
Um, and probably deeply influenced by readings of known us and Galen and others.
Right.
I doubt many people have looked much at Galen.
Um, and Almond seems to think very highly of the contributions of Galen and known us, particularly also Aeschylus is a little more commonly read.
So I think it's my sense that Almond has read some stuff that common people just haven't seen.
And it'd be wildly unlikely that Jefferson had seen any of that stuff, but it's conceivable.
I suppose I have no idea what, what he was reading or where he was getting it.
And then the other day I was looking up something and I found it quite, I guess, in almonds ballpark of things.
So I don't know if you know what our state flag of Virginia looks like.
Not off the top of my head.
I don't.
So there's a, and I never paid much attention, but I looked at that the other day and I'm like, I was like, what?
That's a Scythian woman.
And so, uh, there's a woman, one, uh, left, left breast exposed and she's standing on top of what is depicted sort of as a, a person with a crown.
And, uh, and I was like, huh, that's weird.
And I said, I wonder who, uh, who designed that when that was even designed.
And of course it was George Wythe and George Wythe was Thomas Jefferson's law professor among other things, and also signer of the declaration.
And so this was his, his design and he, he labels her as an Amazon.
And it's, it's, it's kind of a, uh, a strange scene, but it, it's very much the, uh, you know, they read a lot of classics.
They read a lot of classics, they read a lot of classics in Greeks.
And, and so he's putting that in there and it's like, um, and, and of course his story becomes very strange because he, he's actually poisoned by his grandnephew, uh, in the tea.
So he's, he's killed by poison and obsessed with this Scythian woman.
And, uh, it's kind of interesting what they thought of, um, these sorts of things.
Cause, cause, cause clearly they, they, they read a lot.
I mean, they were reading a lot of, they weren't reading Galen, but they were fairly aware of a lot of stuff that I guess, look, growing up, we don't learn Greek.
And, and they were reading Greek, reading Plato in Greek and, and, uh, I believe Seneca and some other things that he was into.
But, uh, he, he liked this idea of the Scythian woman, uh, scantily clad on his flag.
And, uh, it, it kinda, it kinda was interesting that it came back into a lot of things come back into Jefferson's life.
Uh, at least for me.
And so when you see, you know, we, we, we, we talked briefly about the procession
of the equinox and the, the, the Hamlet's mill stuff.
So Thomas Jefferson's birthday changes in, uh, 1752 by 11 days when they reset the calendar.
And again, I used to know that as just a fact that his birthday switches to the 13th, um, of April, 1743.
But then I was puzzled why, um, George Washington's birthday changes from 1731 to 1732 in the same year,
as well as adding 11 days to his birthday.
But I never, I never put it together with the procession of the equinox.
So the, over a period of time, the, the, the, the spring was moving because they were using a year
as being the time it took for the earth to go around in the sun.
And what happens is that, uh, every 72 years spring gets a day earlier.
And so the equinox was around the 10th, I think at that point.
And so to push it back to the 21st, they added 11 days in, in, in one year.
And then for whatever reason, people changed their birthday to the new calendar birthday.
And they also changed the beginning of the year from March to, uh, January.
Wow.
And so George Washington's birthday changed by a year.
And so instead of being born in the 12th month, he was then born in the second month of the year.
And his birthday goes from the 11th to the 22nd.
And his birth year goes from 1731 to 1732.
Weird.
Wow.
Nothing of this.
All that mathematics that they did at that point was to readjust the calendar.
And that's the same mathematics that the Egyptians were doing.
And I think it go Buckley Tappy.
They were aware of this as well, that every 72 years, you gotta, you gotta change the days or else spring starts moving or, you know, they, they, they were aware of these things.
And, and, and the fact that it just comes into, there's a lot of weird stuff that comes back into Jefferson's, uh, I don't know, life.
And probably in other people's lives as well, if you, you know, looked at them.
Hmm.
So I don't know.
I tried to, I tried to bring everything back into, into, into poor Mr. Jefferson and, and, uh, make sense of it that way.
But, uh, it's my paradigm of, of, uh, analysis, but he, he did look at language and saw, he didn't look at as many languages, but he saw this pattern was there.
And it, and it, and it, and it, it made him curious.
So he was aware of it.
Do you think, um, to some degree, you caught it from him?
Or did it really start?
No, I, I don't, I mean, it didn't.
When did it really start?
It only started when I tried to figure out what the letter K was.
Hmm.
And then when I realized that the letter K was the hand, it was very similar to the numbers that were being used that I, that I was like, I wonder if other letters also correspond to some things.
And I, I started, um, you know, some of them are fairly well known and some of them are not.
Why K?
It was, it was similar to the hand on the door that I was doing.
It's, it's, it's, I don't know.
It just, the K was the first one that I, that I made sense of.
Um, it's funny because, um, you know, the Vulcan symbol, right?
For live long and prosper.
This actually comes from synagogue.
This is, uh, right.
This is something that the priests used to summon the Shekinah, right?
But it's very, it's very K like, although it's, you know, it's usually pointed out.
Well, it's actually, I would say is the sh symbol.
Yeah.
And it is, it is the symbolic in the Hebrew is the, they're representing that in the, the shape of their letter for, for the Shin is three points.
Oh, right.
Yeah.
And so, and so when I got into looking at the Hawaiian, the Hawaiian language fascinated me endlessly.
So when I started looking at Hawaiian, there's some weird things that show up in the Hawaiian.
One, one, of course, is they use the shaka, but it is actually making a three pointed symbol as well.
And what, what, what fascinated me the most about that is that there's no letter S in the Hawaiian.
And yet they have this word, which is clearly with the letter S.
And then I looked up their word for snake.
And it's, uh, nahesa.
And I, and I, and I, again, I already knew they had no letter S and I said, there's something up with this.
Uh, where did they get this from?
And I, and I started looking at when did the Hawaiian language come into being, and it comes into being a written language in 1822.
This is a very big year.
It's the same year that they decipher the, um, the Champollion deciphers the, uh, Egyptian.
Now, one year later, and the guy who did it was Eliza, Elijah Loomis.
And he is from upstate New York.
And I told my mother this story cause I, I have to tell her things.
And, uh, she said, is that in the same area as Joseph Smith?
And I said, I don't know anything about Joseph Smith.
And I look up Joseph Smith.
So Joseph Smith allegedly translated his, uh, golden tablets in 1823, a year after, uh, Champollion discovers how to decipher Egyptian.
Suddenly he's doing it.
And it's, and it's just a few miles down the road from where this, uh, missionary who goes to, uh, what were at the time called the sandwich islands of Hawaii, who goes and makes their written language for them.
And he was only like 20 years old when he did it.
And he was trying to translate the Bible into Hawaiian.
And he basically was the only one to preserve the language of Hawaiian.
Hawaiian.
Otherwise it probably would be completely lost.
And he goes there and he clearly is translating from the Hebrew, not the, cause he uses Nahash, which is the snake.
Yes.
In Hebrew.
They don't have snakes.
They don't have snakes in Hawaii.
So they don't need a word for snake.
Oh, that's what I was thinking.
Actually.
I was, yeah, as you were speaking, I was like, do they even have snakes?
Like, why did they need a word for it?
And so they, so they don't even have the letter S in his, in his, uh, you know, language.
They only have like eight consonants and S is not one of them.
And when you start looking at how he had to create, um, their language, but he's trying to do it to fit the Bible translation.
So he makes a, uh, a Hawaiian Bible, uh, his father, some sort of, I guess, printer in upstate New York, uh, not that far from Joseph Smith's little, uh, place.
And just the, the coincidence of the timing is, is, is fascinating because you have all of this language stuff happening around the world in the same year.
Uh, even discounting Joseph Smith, who I, I would say is a coattail follower of something that was in the news at the time.
You know, when they, they suddenly deciphered these Egyptian tablets, he's like, well, maybe I can, uh, so the next year he's doing it.
But it's the same year that languages all around the world were being translated or first written down.
Probably usually to make, uh, a biblical translation by some sort of, you know, so throughout, uh, Africa, uh, the Maori was the same year.
Um, so missionaries were going out and, and kind of trying to compile languages of native people.
A lot of native American languages were first written down about that same time period too.
Wow.
And prior to that, no one seemed to care about language that much.
It was kind of good.
Yeah.
Well, um, once you're going to try to convert people to your strange, uh, religion, then you need to be able to have, I mean, whenever I see any indigenous people and they're carrying a book, I'm like, oh God, no, please help me.
Cause you know, you know, what's coming next.
Right.
Like.
So it's, it's, uh, it's, it's weird stuff that shows up in language that if it suddenly makes it, cause that's clearly, you know, it's like, well, how did Hebrew get to Hawaii?
And that's, you know, it's a, it, that's the journey of that, just that one word, but, uh, you, you find a lot of other weird coincidences.
Um, when I look through things and that, that kind of, I don't know, it's like a Sudoku puzzle that I enjoy or something as to.
No, I mean, I think there's something, um, I mean, I don't want to put words in your mouth, but our souls, our spirit, it finds likenesses in the estranged graveyard of human behavior and activity.
And in a way it seeks its awakening through these reflections and the origins of language have to do with matters that are fundamentally transcendental to rational thought.
So that's a perfect place for the soul to play, to recover itself, to, to remember its nature.
It seems to me.
Wow.
See, you, you, you get it much more than, uh, yeah, no, it's, it's, there, there's clearly a pattern.
There's clearly the, the, the thumbprint.
The thumbprint and when you, particularly when you look at the native American stuff, the timeline would be, oh, they've been over isolated for 10,000 years from, you know, contact.
That's a guess.
Whatever.
We didn't know if they were isolated.
But then you get these recurrent patterns again, and it's the same, it's the same thumbprint.
And, you know, it, I don't know if it means that we have a common origin of language or a common, um, a common contact with something that is forming language over and over again.
Where people are picking up language, the concept of language from some other realm, I guess, if that makes sense.
That's to me.
Yeah.
And that's, that's the hard part to explain because that becomes the, you know, you have to, there, there's, there was somebody that was doing, uh, I think,
it was cave paintings and found that, or that there's imagery in the caves.
And she found that they were all from around the world from different times.
And they all have basically the same set of like 32 different patterns repeated.
Right.
Right.
And yet they, they probably didn't have direct contact physically with each other, but somehow were, and then when you get it, I've never done the DMT stuff, but, uh, Graham Hancock said, I think he's, I think he told me he'd done it 72 times, not to be symbolic, but, uh, that he did ayahuasca, uh, 72 times when he, when he told me about that.
Uh, it's, it's, it's a very good number either way, but, uh, there's a common when people paint, when they're on the ayahuasca, they paint the same set of images.
And yeah, I mean, um, this, this brings up another thing that I'll just mention, and then we should probably wrap up for now.
Okay.
I need to get some food, but, um, if you are in a place where there are trees, and if you are in the sunlight, there are two things that should become relatively obvious, um, fairly quickly, but they aren't.
The first is that there is always a rainbow.
If you look at the sun through the branches of a tree, you will see circular rainbow that is scintillating.
It's very profound.
It's always there.
And, you know, people think, oh, rainbows.
It's a thing with the water.
No, no.
It's a thing with trees, right?
The water thing is vastly more rare and fascinating, but there's one every single moment that you're hearing.
That you're near a tree.
And clearly people were aware of this.
It's a very profound thing.
I encourage you to take a moment and try to see one sometime soon.
It's really, when people talk about drug experiences and stuff that, that can be fascinating sometimes, but they should look at things that are immediately apparent that they don't see.
Right.
And this is one of them.
There is always a rainbow if the sun is behind a tree branch, especially certain times of year, it's much more profound.
And it's really different from anything you'd expect from a rainbow.
It's alive, right?
It's coruscating inside the colors.
It's just amazing.
But the second thing is that if you are walking through woods and there is bright light, it leaves phosphenes.
It makes phosphene after images on the iris.
And these are going to be the same for everybody around the world to get a little more esoteric about it.
So, I believe that it's become formally demonstrated that our eyes emit photons and they emit photons onto the backs of the eyelids when they're closed.
It produces the phenomenon we call phosphenes, which you can see if you just close your eye and press on it gently.
You don't want to hurt your eye right after time you'll start to see patterns and those patterns are going to be the same pretty much around the world.
They may differ slightly in different peoples because in different peoples, the eye develops differently.
It's not just like everyone has the same thing.
That's the academic fiction.
Oh, yeah, we're all humans.
It's all the same everywhere.
No, there's nothing like that going on.
The eye is very similar, but in different places, it develops differently.
So there's so much to explore and discover if we're curious, right?
Because we've been buried in academic fictions and there's lots of them that we shouldn't dismiss, but neither should we consider them authoritative.
Interesting.
Well, I was, I guess, fairly recently told by her about genetics that we don't have just a mother and a father.
We have an X and a Y and an M.
So we have, you're related to your father by a percent, your mother by a percent, and your mother's mother's mother's mother's mother's mothers.
So, yeah, yeah, the mitochondria, the mitochondrial DNA comes from the matrilineal line, but it's not, I'm sorry, go ahead.
Oh, and what she's, what was interesting about that, and it was, it was much more information than that, but our DNA can evolve out, out stripping our RNA's ability or the mitochondrial's ability to keep up with it.
Hmm.
I'm not sure what that could mean.
I mean, those two things are so intimately linked.
In terms of, there's a lot more evolution going on in your nucleus chromosomes can jump back and forth and your, your mitochondria hasn't evolved.
And so there's, there's a, and this is a lot of this stuff was stuff that I don't have backgrounds in, but I just am explaining what I, what I have been informed about.
Um, we've, we've evolved, uh, difference, difference enzymes than, than our fairly recent ancestors.
Hmm.
And, uh, so one of those enzymes is amylase.
Um, I've, I've had to look up some of this stuff, but the, the, the, the bulk of the, uh, example is the same feature has happened to dogs.
Um, so a wolf, a wolf has two amylase genes in the first position.
Don't ask me how I know this, but they do.
And, uh, I've looked that up, but the, uh, the Labrador has as many as 16 mutations or 14 more mutations.
And what happens is that the first position is pancreatic amylase.
Hmm.
The second position, if there's a mutation and you have four, it goes, the, the second pair causes a doubling of the pancreatic amylase.
The third position causes saliva amylase.
And most animals don't have that, but humans do and dogs do also.
And then the third position, a fourth position fourth, which is the, if you had eight, eight pairs would be the fourth position.
Doubles the amount of saliva amylase, which gets broken down in your stomach anyway, after you've swallowed, but it's pre-digestion ability of your, of your mouth.
I see.
Um, and this is, this is where it probably gets beyond, uh, scientific knowledge.
Scientific knowledge, but the fifth position is because of the insertion, a fold.
So the 10th pairs don't are inactivated and then it reverses backwards.
And so it's, it's, uh, I follow.
It's an offshoot of the DNA because it's adding segments into kind of, uh, a little spike.
Hmm.
And, and the end is, is not active.
And the problem with that is that it, it has made dogs have the DNA of a, uh, vegetarian, but the mitochondria of a wolf.
It still has the wolf mitochondria has not changed.
And so the, uh, you know, so anyway, it, it, it, it shows that there's a difference between what is an adaptation of one part of our body and not the other part of the same, you know, the same cell.
Uh, and this, this, this disparity is what causes the, the metabolic issues that are existing, including cancer.
Hmm.
So that the wolf, the wolf, the wolf is still in the, in the lab in its mitochondria.
And if it's eating this new diet that it can eat because of its new enzymes, it, it is over straining the, uh, the mitochondria of the wolf.
Hmm.
Fascinating.
And, and none of these thoughts are anything that I would, uh, put, you know, it's not my, uh, it's not my field to, uh, dispute.
No, but you've become curious about it.
And so you've, uh, you know, you found, you have sought out some information and forged some understanding around it.
And so the, and then, and then it's more of the afterwards of trying to figure out what this, what this nonsense that I've been, or, you know, whatever it has been, been, you have information and then you, you, you then try to make sense of it.
It's true.
It's true.
Who was the woman that introduced you to the concepts around the genome?
Did I misunderstand you?
Oh, no, no, that was just, just information that I, we'll, we'll call her, I don't know, the muse, whatever you want to.
Oh, I see.
Okay.
That's why I say it's not anything that I have any, uh, explanation of.
Hmm.
I see.
But just, just the idea, I don't know, you're talking about, uh, our genetic makeup, I guess, in the nature.
Yeah.
Um, but, you know, these are, these are strange, uh, to some people thoughts that you have to then kind of put into, into the world of, of.
Well, you organize them in relationship to some concern, right?
Yeah.
This is what happens.
We organize.
Percepts into concepts, something like this.
Um, but I think most people think it should happen the other way with that.
You have a bunch of data and you come to a conclusion.
I mean, with the questions that really matter for me, I tend to avoid conclusions.
There's a better, there's a better perspective available for inquiry than the one that I'm used to.
So a conclusion is the end of a relationship with a question.
It's like getting a divorce from your wife.
I tend to, I tend to get married to the big questions.
So not looking for a conclusion myself, though.
I understand that people like to put concerns to rest, right?
Otherwise they may find them troubling.
Interesting.
Well, I'm so grateful to you for this time we've had together today and for your work and your curiosity and your passion.
Um, it's just been amazing to learn with you.
Um, I'm just super happy about this.
So I hope we may, I hope we may, um, have another conversation sometime soon.
Yeah.
I, I, I hopefully I'll have, uh, new things.
I like the idea of that.
It's a ongoing conversation rather than, uh, coming to a conclusion.
Hmm.
Me too.
Thank you.
My friend.
It's great to meet you.
Thank you.
I'll see you another time soon.
And I wish you every good thing over there in Virginia.
Well, I look forward to your, to your next interviews as well with the Egyptologists.
And thank you, my friend.
Bye bye for now.
Bye.
Bye.
