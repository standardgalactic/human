Hello, everybody. Welcome.
Truly grateful to have this time together to learn and grow and explore
and discover some of the confusingly obscured aspects of our nature, our origins,
as beings and organisms and animals and human beings,
capable of the peculiarly dangerous behavior that I refer to as formal representational cognition.
Most likely, though it's difficult to be sure, without a direct experience of the interiority of other beings,
which is accessible to human beings, but is uncommon among us, particularly among moderns.
It seems to have been common for our people throughout much of our history,
according to the records that we have discovered and probably misinterpreted,
but also according to existing indigenous peoples.
I recall seeing a report from an ethnologist
where, in conversation with an Australian indigenous man,
the man began crying, the indigenous man,
when he heard the ethnologist declare that no one can hear the stars.
for the indigenous man could not imagine being human
and not having this
as part of one's common direct experience of being human.
He didn't mean the noises the stars make.
Clearly,
what he meant was
to hear
the communication
of the stars
to humans.
You know, when, we live, within, constantly, surrounded by cages,
and rectangles,
and frames,
that naturally,
by their nature, function, and structure,
evict novelty,
and intelligence,
communion,
and remembering,
then we are apt to become, not merely blind,
but to become self-blind,
because it turns out that for human cognition,
as the perceptual aperture
shrinks,
so does the recognition,
that it is shrinking,
and thus,
what is evicted from our
common experience,
perception,
participation,
expectation,
categorization,
and so forth,
eventually becomes most of what's going on,
whatever that may be,
and much of what's going on,
is intrinsically mysterious,
and unavailable,
to common representational,
templates,
protocols.
So, we find ourselves,
in an ever-shrinking trap,
where our certitude,
that we know the facts,
is at once,
deceptively incomplete,
and peculiarly,
self-incompleting,
it just keeps evicting,
more and more,
of our potential,
for relational eros,
and intimacy,
and wonder,
and awe,
and play,
and the more,
that gets evicted,
the more common,
and trenchant,
further,
deprivations become.
This is detailed,
at great length,
in Ian McGilchrist's books,
The Master and His Emissary,
and his magnum opus,
the matter with things.
It seems that,
what we refer to,
as our left hemisphere,
which usually,
points at,
the left cerebral cortex,
which is a layer,
a relatively thin layer,
as I understand it,
on the left side,
of our brains.
This seems to be,
an experimental workshop,
in a sense,
for possible elaborations,
and specific elaborations,
of the potentials,
of the right hemisphere,
in those cases,
where most,
of the right hemisphere's way,
of being in the world,
is either severely limited,
or evicted.
Peculiarly,
we know,
from experiments,
in which,
the WADA test,
in which,
is no longer legal,
but,
in which,
once,
one of the,
cortexes,
could be anesthetized,
that,
the left hemisphere,
manufactures fictions,
and,
clings to them,
with greater,
and greater,
and greater severity,
the more,
they are questioned.
We also,
know this,
from interviewing,
patients,
who've had strokes,
on the right hemisphere,
and some of the reports,
from such patients,
are startling.
When asked,
about their paralyzed,
left hand,
they might reply,
that's not mine,
it's yours,
that's a piece of laundry,
that someone left here,
that belongs to my mother,
tell her to come and get it.
One patient reported that,
that's not my arm,
it belongs to a,
tiny African man,
who lives under the bed.
Another patient,
startlingly,
said that,
that's not my arm,
it's a stock option.
These patients,
could not,
by any means,
be convinced,
that their left arm,
actually belonged,
to their body.
However,
caloric,
vestibular stimulation,
discovered,
I think in the late 1800s,
by an Italian neuroscientist.
This is a procedure,
in which cold water,
is dribbled,
into the left,
ear canal,
while the patient,
lies on their right side,
so that that canal,
is pointing up.
Can briefly,
reconnect the hemispheres,
at which point,
at which point,
the patients become,
aware,
of the situation,
and often become,
extremely emotional,
about the fact,
that they were,
clearly lying,
to the doctor.
This implies,
that the right hemisphere,
is aware,
of the left hemisphere,
of the left hemisphere's,
estrangement,
from reality.
Apparently,
for the disconnected,
left hemisphere,
and it can quite be,
it can become,
quite disconnected,
for regular,
ordinary persons.
It's really just,
a matter of degree.
My own experience,
is constantly,
subject to this.
I believe,
something to be the case,
and particularly,
if I feel offended,
threatened,
violated,
not seen,
mistreated,
or otherwise,
is,
placed,
in jeopardy.
It's very surprising,
how quickly,
my awareness,
collapses,
from,
the entire field,
of possibilities,
to the one feature,
of my experience,
which I have decided,
to be,
the facts.
Now this is not to say,
that there are no facts,
but rather,
that the facts,
that we derive,
from experience,
and experiment,
are not self-explanatory.
None of them,
tell us what they mean.
In order to,
interpret facts,
we have to have,
something like,
the right hemisphere's open,
unusual,
dreamlike,
and deeply honest,
space,
space,
space,
space,
the space,
in which we,
from which we experience,
understanding,
too commonly,
the left hemisphere's,
play in this,
complex mess,
of,
consciousness,
and cognition,
has nothing to do,
with understanding.
What it claims,
to understand,
it actually,
overstands.
It dominates.
And it dominates,
from a place,
of fiction.
Now,
I have a couple of,
orienting purposes,
in today's talk.
But for many years,
decades in fact,
I've been aware,
both conceptually,
and experientially,
that the human minds,
form a network.
And that network,
is real,
just as real,
as the physical world.
But differently real.
It includes all humans.
It has both,
uh,
ordinary,
i.e. physical,
and non-ordinary,
infrastructure,
connections.
Right?
Which I call,
so I call the network,
the cognitium.
And the connections,
I call the mimula.
Most of the connectivity,
is non-ordinary.
Meaning,
there are no explanative,
humans are a,
not aware of this.
Have no language about it.
Concepts for it.
Generally speaking.
And b,
it's non-ordinary,
in the sense that,
physical connections,
are not required.
For information,
to be transmitted between,
and processed by humans.
And groups of humans.
And subgroups of humans.
And so on.
If,
um,
someone wants to look for evidence,
it's all over the place.
But,
no one has,
that I'm aware of,
has proposed such a theory.
Therefore,
there's been no exploration of it.
We might,
therefore,
reasonably state,
that there is no evidence,
for the existence of the cognitium.
Of course,
evidence is everywhere.
But,
when nobody goes looking for it,
then there is no evidence.
Unfortunately,
over the past 20 years,
the human cognitium,
has been experiencing a series of shocking devastations.
That further limit,
the right hemisphere-like presence,
aspects in that network.
And further magnify the left hemisphere-like aspects.
And so,
there is a cataclysm,
occurring in the human cognitium,
which,
arises from the cascade of devastations,
over very short periods of human time.
Five years,
10 years,
15,
20,
and so forth.
And so forth,
with the frequency of new devastations,
introduced into this manifold.
Rapidly,
if not exponentially increasing.
This must not be unrelated to the machines we call large language models,
or artificial intelligence.
Because,
obviously,
anything that,
any devices that are connected to human minds,
or that human minds connect with or through,
affect the structure,
activity,
and anatomy of the human cognitium.
And, wherever they reinforce left hemispheric-like values,
perspectives, priorities,
then corresponding damage occurs,
not just in individual minds,
but in the network of minds,
that connect all of us,
not merely to each other,
but to all of nature.
There are layers of the cognitia of the earth.
There's the viral layer,
the single cell layer,
the bacterial layer,
the vegetal layer,
the insect layer,
the invertebrate layer,
right?
There are all these layers.
Tigers have their own cognitium,
but it's in intimate symbiosis with all of the others,
so effects to the other cognitia,
are transferred,
via inheritance,
to each of the organs,
of the planet's cognitium,
in this model or toy.
What's truly dangerous about this is that,
as the assets we rely upon
to understand and detect problems,
threats and opportunities,
as those assets are damaged,
or as they collapse into mere structural features,
we will not know.
Anything that affects what you make determinations with,
cannot be detected.
In other words,
anything that limits or changes your capacity for detection,
cannot itself be detected,
so you will be unaware of it.
You could wake up tomorrow as an entirely different person,
and you would not know that you had been someone else before.
Yeah, you're literally just going to step over it.
Step over it?
Now, the subject that I'm talking about gives us some degree
of potential to understand our situation and to cope with it,
but it gives us no immunity against anything
that affects what we make determinations with.
It's not clear that any such immunity is even possible,
although if it were,
it would come from liberating right hemisphere-like assets
in waking consciousness,
and possibly from any practice or situation
that resulted in what we may refer to as enlightenment,
which we must imagine places, consciousness,
grants,
we might imagine that it grants a conscious being
positions above, below, and outside of the cognitium
from which to safely interact with it
without being determined by its qualities
or characteristics in the moment.
Dreaming is affected by the cognitium,
by the state, the current state,
and the current local, personal, communal, and so forth,
conductivities that may or may not arise.
But it is also partly outside the cognitium.
It's somewhat difficult for me to model this,
but it is as if dreaming humans form a distinct
body of knowledge, awareness,
awareness, and even representations that the dreaming mind has access to,
but the waking mind is mostly divorced from in most situations.
So I have sensed directly and had direct experience of
the catastrophic collapse of various features of the previously existing cognitium of humans.
And these have occurred primarily in ways that are easily sensed
and experienced over the past 20 years, but particularly in the last 10.
The problem appears to be getting catastrophically worse over even short periods of time
as evinced by sleep and dreaming and metabolic problems in the humans
that affect each person uniquely.
Some are more immune than others, some are more vulnerable than others.
The sequelae for any individual human, the consequences, can be radically different from another.
One person can appear largely unaffected.
A person right next to them can be effectively debilitated.
This is the nature of how beings are.
Categories are deceptive.
They are generalizations over a manifold.
So in the same way that every human who lives is born,
their birth circumstances and childhood circumstances differ dramatically from each other.
In some cases, they might as well be on different planets.
Consider a child that grows up in staggering poverty, malnourished, perhaps physically mistreated,
versus a child born to an extremely wealthy family where their every need and desire is immediately gratified.
They're both human.
They're both on the same planet.
Their experience of what being human means might as well be two different things.
And this is part of the next part of my talk today.
So categories are wildly deceptive.
They're useful in a limited way as long as we remain aware of the scope of their reliability,
which is usually vastly more minimal than anything we would be inclined to suppose.
So it is my sense that the human cognitium is now and has been undergoing
a cascade of cataclysmic
collapses
in its diverse structure and particularly in the aspects of its structure that are primarily
inherited from human right hemispheric activity, concern, behavior, relationship, and so on.
For the right hemisphere, relationship is everything.
Names, concepts, tokenizations, quantities, and so forth are
not meaningless, but they don't dominate evaluation.
In fact,
for the right hemisphere, evaluation is relation, whereas for the left hemisphere,
evaluation is disembodied, abstract accounting.
Now, those are gross simplifications, but they suffice to communicate the spirit of the situation.
Now, getting back to problems with categories,
we who live in boxes have no idea what we are or what the world is.
If you were to go with a skillful indigenous person into the jungle,
the shell of your habits might survive for a time, but as time wore on,
your understanding of what you are, what the world is, what organisms are,
what the forest is, what the lake is, what the mountain is, what the sky is,
would undergo radical transformations. And this is not because you would become drunkenly indoctrinated
by the superstitions of the indigenous person. Quite the opposite.
The ridiculous suppositions that you have suffered with about your nature, what humans are, identity,
machines, boxes, and so forth, would wear off. And suddenly, aspects of your nature and origin
and interiority would become commonly present to your direct experience.
You would probably have experiences of direct communication with other organisms, something
modern humans consider to be impossible. And not just organisms, but living places. The mountain,
the sky, the lake, the forest, the desert, the tundra.
So we who live in boxes in modernity are bereft of nearly everything we are born to know, relate with, and become.
And we are so habituated to this prison that anything that threatens it is likely to be attacked by us.
Because, after all, if we were to admit the novel transforming influence of our actual nature,
this would naturally draw into question our entire history of behavior. And it would be found to have been
not merely confused, but often, in many cases, vicious, stupid, wildly ignorant,
arrogantly, grandiosely ignorant.
One of the fingerprints of left hemispheric-like dismissal of the vast universe of faculties and natures
that arise as human beings
is the phrase, there's no evidence of that.
The stroke patient who is
declaring that their left arm is not part of their body and belongs to a small African man who lives under their bed,
is in the grip of a wild fiction.
But what they are,
what's going on inside their mind
is a complete refusal,
a very complete, an absolute refusal to entertain the possibility
that that limb on their left side
is actually part of their body.
So you can see that inside the mind of such a person, at least in the left hemisphere,
which is still functioning after the stroke,
there's no evidence that that arm belongs to me.
And they will try to produce evidence that it doesn't.
So this is quite astonishing.
But it's an aspect of the trap we're in.
The capacity for formal representational cognition is a profound potential
that could become an astonishing array of gifts,
but is so incredibly dangerous
that what it becomes in any
cohort of humans who are disconnected from each other in nature
is a series of ever more devastating, if not apocalyptic threats.
So the potential for profound developmental efflorescence and so forth is there,
but that's not what's going on
if we take
the trend over the curve.
The possibility space of human behavior versus what actually gets mostly enacted,
commonly enacted.
Evil, whether or not evil beings exist,
exists
as the inaction of disembodied left hemispheric-like priorities,
counting the dollars, stacking them up in banks and so forth.
So the other night I was, I'm going to switch topics here,
the other night I was talking with my son,
same general direction, however, categories, problem with categories.
You know,
I've spent a great deal of time in intimate contact with insects.
I wouldn't call myself an entomologist.
Perhaps I am
entomophilic, right?
I adore all living beings, all living things.
Though, like most humans, I have
I have disaffinities, right?
I'm not a huge fan of ticks, for example.
But I've had experiences
with insects and arthropods
that completely destroyed
what the common humans think
about them, how they think about them.
And the thing I want to talk about is that
along with having the wrong idea about what we are
and what nature is and what the sky is,
we have the wrong idea
about what categories are.
We don't know what trees are.
We don't know what animals are.
We don't know what humans are.
But we also have this other concept
that is interesting.
Two concepts, actually.
The first is angels.
This is usually deployed
as a pointer
to a divine messenger being
or enactor being.
A being that enacts
the will of the divine.
No huge problems there, except
that we think,
most of us,
that angels only exist in
a kind of never-never land
somewhere between,
somewhere above physical space, right?
And that's not entirely a problem either.
Then we have this other word,
gods.
This is a much more complicated concept.
Because gods and angels
resemble each other.
Then we have the
unifor god,
god, which refers to a single being
from which everything,
apparently, conceptually anyway,
is born or originates or is created by.
So we have these concepts, right?
But in my experience
of interacting with animals
and insects,
fishes and reptiles,
it's clear to me
that divine beings incarnate.
And that means that some of those snakes
aren't snakes.
Some of those trees are not trees.
Some of those raccoons are not raccoons.
Some of those humans are not humans.
You can encounter a human
so astonishing
and so catastrophically
generative of immediate transformation
in your awareness,
perception,
ideation,
lexicons and so forth,
that it is impossible to determine
what category it belongs to.
I have encountered a number of humans like this.
Perhaps to some degree, I am one.
A tiger or lion is obviously a god.
It transcends everything about the box cultures
and common suppositions.
It doesn't give a shit what you think or believe.
As a friend,
it might as well be like having an angel with you.
As an enemy,
it might as well be like encountering a demon.
Now,
it's my experience that all living things
have this quality
of being vessels
whose interiority encompasses
the divine.
In other words,
organisms are a bit like
the opposite of UFOs.
They are the portion,
they are
a vehicle in material existence
for the interiorization
and participation
of divine beings.
And what I mean by divine,
so far,
is simply transcendental
to the merely physical.
I also mean non-ordinary.
Now, I have encountered insects
that were capable of direct telepathic communication
with my mind.
Animals, living places, trees, and so forth.
It's not extremely common,
although its commonality
increases as I reduce the degree of strangeness
required to qualify for non-ordinary.
So, for example,
last night,
a moth entered my house
and there was a,
it was a large moth
and there was some
concern on my part
about its well-being.
It was disoriented
by the bright lights and such.
We had a number of physical interactions.
At first,
the moth responded to me primarily
as either a threat
or an unknown
thing.
But over a short period of time,
through contact with my mind and body,
the moth became intelligently aware
that it was disoriented,
that it was in danger,
and that I was trying to assist it.
At that point, it calmed down,
climbed onto an object I presented to it,
remained on that object
while I took it past
a number of bright lights,
and when I got it outside,
after a period of adjustment,
it climbed onto my finger.
We had a moment of
relational intimacy together.
The moth signaled to me
that it was grateful,
in my view,
and then finally departed.
I've had hundreds of experiences like this.
It doesn't mean I'm special.
I am special in the sense
that I acknowledge
the beingness and completeness
of the interiority of living organisms.
And in my essay,
organisms are a platform
for the...
I can't remember the language I used.
for the participation of transcendental beings
in the physical layer of reality.
I talk about this at length.
It's on my Medium page,
organelle.medium.com.
And this has become more and more
a part of my common experience and awareness,
particularly since I met Amber,
a young woman who was paralyzed
in a car accident
from the chest down
last November.
Amber born.
During our conversations,
I experienced cascades of insights
related to this.
And I think we have existence entirely
inside out and backwards.
The idea of worship,
while not something I want to dismiss entirely,
is backwards because we are...
We are a platform for the participation
with the transcendental in the physical layer.
And all organisms are thus,
regardless of their seemingly
small or insignificant size or lifespan.
In fact, it may well be
that the smaller the organism
and the shorter its lifespan,
the more intense
this property becomes.
There's no reason to suspect otherwise yet.
However,
even in relating with humans,
you can meet humans
who were Joe yesterday
and are an angel today.
The expected and proposed continuity
of personal identity is nonsensical
and is primarily a result
of being trapped in contexts
so limiting, confusing,
so filled with relational
and participatory deprivation,
that the personal identity
becomes the only thing
apparent to the person
thus entrapped.
And this naturally leads to grandiosity
and egoism,
arrogance, and so forth.
So what I'm trying to get at is that I think the organisms are gods.
They are angels.
Every one of them.
To differing degrees in different times,
you can encounter a dog
that is just like a human mostly concerned with its personal identity.
You can also encounter a dog
that will immediately give its life to protect you
or to heal you
in a non-ordinary way.
Modern humans don't believe that dogs have any inherent capacity to heal humans.
Those moderns are so confused that they have mistaken a matchstick for the sun.
Or rather, the other way around.
They've mistaken the sun for a matchstick.
There isn't anything but divine beings.
The physical layer is profoundly deceptive
and nothing is more deceptive about this than human cognition.
At least in moderns.
The formal representational stuff I was talking about earlier.
So I hope that you, the listener,
will receive my words as an invitation
to both escape the trap and to resist the urge
to continue collapsing the manifold of your nature, origin, being, and faculties
into conceptual representations.
This is something we need each other's help with.
I had transcendental assistance in this matter
for which I am profoundly grateful.
But I have faced many catastrophic and dangerous
and painful challenges in the aftermath of that experience
because, like you, I live in
the representational layer of human,
common human behavior, thought, activity, judgment, and so forth.
Our children are born free of this,
though they may carry some traces of it
and a propensity for uptake of representational cognition.
But when they are new,
it's blatantly obvious if you simply just look in their eyes,
you will see
that they are infinite, they are divine, they are transcendental.
Unless you reject these concepts
as not matching your experience or the evidence that you've been presented with,
in which case you will just think,
nah, it's just a human infant, no big deal.
Though very few parents are capable of that degree of dismissal, at least in the beginning.
I am still in the process of processing
what I've experienced
and
I can find both kinds of other people,
people who will just dismiss this out of hand, rationalists and skeptics.
But if you look back to the beginning of the discussion,
it's obvious that if you establish and sustain a structure
that defends you from insight and novelty and exploration,
then that structure will recursively tighten the aperture
until what you're capable of entertaining is basically nothing but dead language and concepts.
There are sort of two kinds of ignorance
in this way. I mean, there are myriads of kinds, but two that I'm concerned with here.
The first is the ignorance of not knowing.
But the second is the ignorance of the habitual
rejection of anything that would transform the trap.
And this is the common position of skeptics.
They think of themselves as, quote, evidence-based, unquote.
But again, there will be no evidence for anything you don't go looking for.
And the fact that you might find
or locate some prosaic explanation for some phenomena
does not mean that the phenomena is equivalent to your explanation.
In fact, phenomena, there are no phenomena that are equivalent to an explanation.
None. Zero.
When I was a, maybe I was seven or eight, we had in our backyard in Stockton,
an enormous orb weaver, spider, and my memory may exaggerate things slightly.
That does happen.
And I misremember things as well. I'm human.
But I remember that spider's spread as being about the size of my face or larger at that age.
And she was golden and black and orange and was, in every reasonable aspect of my experience of her, a god.
I used to catch these large moths
in the grass in our small backyard lawn.
And I would hold them up near her web and she would climb down on my hand to retrieve them.
And we would have a moment of intimacy in that sense.
And then she would return to her web.
We were very, we were very close friends.
My parents marveled at this.
But I had many spider friends when I was young.
I still have some today.
Though nothing as glorious as her.
I'm not sure if this is apparent, but most of the spiders that you will see in webs are females.
It's not that necessarily that males don't make webs.
It's that they're far less noticeable.
And some males don't do much web making.
Some of them are eclectoparasites, so they find webs of females and study the females
by orbiting the web and stealing some of the food that may be captured by the web.
And I can hear in my own mind an objection to the story I told about the spider.
What about the moths?
Why were you feeding the moths to the spider?
Aren't they gods too?
They are.
But I was oriented by the unimaginable sophistication and charisma of the spider.
And that orientation, I'm not sure I would do the same thing today.
It's very difficult for me to feed an animal to another animal, emotionally.
There are also creatures who distribute the divine, the transcendental overpopulations.
And then what you will see, for example, bees and humans.
Then what you will see is, you know, occasionally you'll run into a human.
For example, a ballerina, a surgeon, a professor of philosophy, a painter, a dancer,
sometimes a biologist.
You can discover humans who have radically escaped the definition space of their ordinary humanity
and are, in a sense, either angels or gods compared to the other humans.
If comparison is your goal, you will see that there are humans who have ascended so far beyond
the low lands of their humanity, so to speak, that they are no longer merely human.
And we call them stars in English.
Never for a moment thinking about this connection or even that stars might be beings.
Transcendental beings.
Beings so transcendental that they produce the minds with which we evaluate them as a side effect of their
common activity and an organ of their nature.
But this is how I generally conceive of the physical layer.
I mean, without the sun, there'd be no language, no math, no art, no science, no religion, no arguments, no one to argue.
So the very mind with which we dismiss the transcendental nature of the sun is produced by that star,
moment to moment, instant to instant.
I'm so grateful to have this time together to learn and explore and grow.
And widen the aperture of our access to what it can mean to be human and to what we can become especially together.
