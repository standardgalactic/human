hello everybody
welcome
you know even myself with all of my unusual experience
and strange friends and dreaming
non-ordinary experience
all of this
some of which is staggeringly profound
I am still
most of the time
like a regular human
perhaps the primary difference is that my ontology
in other words what I think is going on
does not muchly resemble that of most humans
though there are exceptions
philosophers
religious people
insightful and curious
regular folks
they may have ontologies that either
have some correspondence to mine
or are quite similar
or
don't
conflict with it
right
so
my ontology would
naturally
correlate with theirs
even though
each side
has unique features
not shared by the other side
I want to talk about
today
about this word reality
and
to begin with
I think it's important to understand
that words don't have meanings
we use words to mean things to each other
if words have something resembling meanings
that are intrinsic to the words
without a speaker
without a context in which they are spoken
then
these meanings
are simply the sense
what are called the senses of the word
the enumerated senses
in a dictionary
but
words without a speaker
and words without a recipient
and words without a context
are in fact meaningless
they don't possess meanings
so
reality
doesn't have a meaning
but
commonly
when humans use this word
what they are referring to
is a layer
of human experience
in which
common expectations
about identity
activity
function
ability
nature
origin
utility
if I didn't already say that
cause and effect
and so forth
are not
the expectations
that
common humans would have
and particularly humans in cohorts
they are familiar with
are not violated
so what
reality means
is a very strange thing
and why is it strange
well it's strange
because it's unjustifiably normative
it both tells us what to expect
and also what to dismiss
and when I refer to this
as a layer
reality
this word
is normally used
commonly used
by people intending to indicate
the layer of human perception
participation
and experience
that does not violate
the expectations
of
common
simple-minded
skeptical people
I say skeptical
because
because
this word
is commonly used
to dismiss
features of experience
participation
identity
and so forth
that produce a mismatch
with expectation
so
for
common people
simple-minded folks
everyday
stuff
they will become
quite upset
if they should encounter
anything that violates
their
strange
confused
disparaging
relationship
with norms
and when I say disparaging
I mean they use norms
to disparage novelty
and what they might call
anomalies
anomalies
are things that
quote
shouldn't happen
unquote
and yet
are occurring
all over the world
billions of times
per second
so
in point of fact
quote
reality
unquote
has all kinds of
features
that don't fit
into the expectations
of common
simple-minded
people
who expect
the expected
and who dismiss
anything
that
draws that
into question
or
perhaps
violates it
now most of the time
when this word is used
the people using it
they think they know
quote unquote
what reality is
what's going on
what isn't going on
what can't go on
and all kinds of things
these are ridiculous
assertions
but they are comforting
and
they enable
us
to ignore
or even
literally
not perceive
anything
anomalies
now in point of fact
anomalies are
everything that's going on
how is that true
well
firstly
no one knows
what anything is
in order to understand
even cause and effect
we have to
limit ourselves
in time
and perspective
to produce
a simple enough
template
for us to
subject
to evaluation
or analysis
and this is mostly
what we do
we are scripted
to
we learn
the protocols
that enforce
concrete identity
that is
only slightly
temporalized
right
it only
modestly
takes time
into account
is
far too
localized
and
produces
relatively
reliable
predictive
results
now in the case
of Newtonian
physics
the results
are
quite
accurate
and
in the case
of
relativity
even more so
but
the
little slice
of reality
that both
of those things
are concerned
with
are
physical
interactions
in space
over time
a close
friend said
that the
this is not
well known
the original aim
of relativity
was to
synchronize clocks
across vast distances
and if that's your goal
the aspects
of the real
that you will
perceive
are extremely minimal
modern science
is largely
concerned
with evicting
the unknown
the mysterious
the novel
and origin
in order to
produce
small scope
highly reliable
predictions
about what
will happen
if we disturb
or introduce
or retract
some variable
when people
use the word
reality
commonly
again
they are referring
to what
they are familiar
with expecting
and
if you don't
pay attention
to novelty
or anomaly
you never
see it
therefore
your world view
your ontology
collapses
more and more
each time
you enact
this protocol
until you
only see
the layer
of experience
that is
the most
predictably
reliable
right
things like
the location
of physical
objects
in my kitchen
now if we
take quantum
physics seriously
it implies
that catastrophic
novelties
must occur
in other words
there will
eventually
be a situation
in which
the dropped
egg
recondenses
after shattering
into a whole
egg
the problem
quote unquote
is that
it would require
according to
present
understandings
billions
of trillions
of dropped
eggs
per second
over time
to occasionally
produce such
a result
but again
if we take
that seriously
what it means
is that novelty
and anomaly
are fundamental
to the nature
of the real
even though
we don't
usually mean
that
when we use
this word
reality
now we
who live
in boxes
that are
dead inside
we who live
in worlds
of machines
and rectangles
everywhere
look around you
and see how many
rectangles you see
if you're not
outside
even if you
are outside
our cars
our chairs
our windows
our walls
our bookshelves
our books
our CDs
our screens
our smartphones
our computers
our doors
our tables
all of these
surround us
with highly
regularized
phenomena
that lead
to the
regularization
of expectation
that evict
novelty
and what we
think of
as anomaly
in point of
fact
the existence
of the real
is a standing
wave
of anomaly
no one
has the
slightest idea
well
not no one
very few
of us
have the
slightest idea
of what
is going
on
like why
are there
trees
what made
eyes
we have
prosaic
explanations
how eyes
are the result
of a physical
evolution
over time
they're just
random mutations
mechanically
piling up
on each other
until you
accidentally
produce something
useful
notice the
emphasis on
usefulness
nature is
filled with
beauty
and beauty
can be seen
from a
utilitarian
standpoint
but it
doesn't
have
its
function
is simply
reduced to
reproduction
right
attract things
to do work
for you
attract things
to mate
with you
that is
not reality
that is a
restrictive
template overlay
on existence
and experience
that overlay
is highly
functional
the reduction
in ambiguity
reduces the
necessity
of vigilance
and
produces
the illusion
of accurate
predictability
however
when examined
carefully
it turns out
that the
scope
of those
benefits
is extremely
limited
and self
limiting
it naturally
limits itself
more and
more over
time
until it
seems to be
the only
thing that's
going on
there are
no anomalies
there's just
the regularized
world
inside the
rectangles
of thought
reflection
conception
language
math
physics
and so on
apparently
very few
people notice
this problem
and it's
not surprising
because
the faculties
with which
we process
experience
and conception
become
self-limiting
in any
situation
where their
structure
deprives us
of input
and this
is naturally
the
purview
the
what's
that word
it may
come to me
later
I won't
dwell on it
now
this is
naturally
the purview
of certain
aspects
of the
left
cortical
hemisphere
which is
in a way
a developmental
feature
of
the right
hemisphere's
brilliance
miraculous
breadth
of depth
and scope
and emotion
and relational
potential
in the same
way that the
fingertips
are the
unique
inaction
bodies
of the
will
in humans
context
context
matters a lot
and relational
context
matters very
deeply
in terms
of
understanding
reality
if you talk
to someone
who has spent
a great deal
of time
as a brilliant
expositor
often
interviewed
by Lex
Fridman
who also
went to
visit him
in the
Amazon
I think
when he
got there
he was
suicidal
not surprising
living in a
world of
dead inside
rectangles
is wildly
unrewarding
even if we
are quote
unquote
successful
in that
world
the network
of human
minds
the
cognizant
is universalized
over the
surface of
the earth
but it
differs
dramatically
in
what it
both
receives
and
communicates
to its
participants
depending on
where they
are
but also
who they
are with
the man
who I
was speaking
of
I can't
recall his
name
he went
to the
Amazon
and his
understanding
of reality
was completely
transformed
by the
experiences
that he
had
with the
indigenous
people
the forest
the snakes
the insects
the trees
and living
places
there
if you're
embedded in
a forest
you're
embedded
in
nature's
cognizia
and you
are
buffered
and protected
from the
catastrophic
exposure
to
modernity
and all
of its
deprivations
and
bizarre
ridiculous
suppositions
about
reality
those
those of
us
who've
had
direct
non-ordinary
experience
and often
this involves
deep
relation
with
other
people
who are
themselves
fundamentally
not
ordinary
people
with a
very
limited
view
of
reality
may
refer
to
such
persons
as
insane
they
think
that
the
actual
shaman
or
medicine
person
of an
indigenous
tribe
is
simply
superstitious
and nuts
they don't
believe in
anything like
magic
and even
this word
is highly
value-laden
for moderns
but
the words
that are
used by
non-moderns
are not
thusly
value-laden
they see
the world
well we would
have to ask
them how
they see
the world
but it's
clear that
many of
them
perceive
the world
as
fundamentally
magical
and
physical
only as
an
after
effect
right
as
sequelae
from
the
transcendental
nature
of
existence
so
they don't
see magic
as a
layer of
the physical
world
they see
the physical
world
as an
expression
of what
we might
call
magic
or
non-ordinary
interactions
between
accessible
to humans
arrays of
intelligence
in nature
if you
were to
go
if you
were to
leave
your city
and go
to a
place
where
there are
actual
humans
who are
practicing
non-ordinary
ways of
being human
you would
quickly
discover
that your
expectations
are wrong
that the
world
is
in fact
shot
through
with
mystery
anomaly
transcendental
intelligence
beings
and minds
that are
not physical
and are
inconceivable
to those
who live
in boxes
and a world
of rectangles
and the
longer
you spent
with them
the more
you would
adapt
to their
perspectives
and orientations
in relationship
particularly
with nature
with organisms
plants
animals
insects
fishes
water
creatures
birds
trees
living places
rivers
mountains
deserts
they do
not
thingify
these features
of our
experience
the way
that moderns
do
and thingifying
them
mostly obliterates
our capacity
to participate
with them
one of my
friends
has a mother
who lives
in Canada
and he was
complaining
this friend
is very
left hemispheric
in his
approach
to the world
and you know
one of the
common excuses
is well
I don't have
any experience
of any of
these things
you're talking
about
so for me
not only
can I not
evaluate them
there's no
evidence of
them in my
experience
well
that's a
self-fulfilling
prophecy
you certainly
will never
see what
you don't
go looking
for
or what
is evicted
by your
ontology
you will
never see
it
it will
never occur
therefore
you will
your
the primacy
of your
ontology
will never
be drawn
into question
by your
experience
because your
ontology
limits what
you can
access
experientially
so
you know
the whole
there's no
evidence of
ghosts
well
there's plenty
of evidence
of ghosts
all over
the place
hundreds of
thousands
of human
experiences
per hour
all over
the world
right
but you can
dismiss that
if you've
never had
that experience
and you
will never
have that
experience
most likely
unless
you find
yourself
in an
anomalous
situation
a situation
where even
given
the limitations
of your
ontology
you have
an experience
that is
inexplicable
according
to your
view
of what
the real
is
if you
go out
and hang
out with
Bedouins
in the
desert
the people
who
are probably
the model
of the
Fremen
in Dune
you will
have all
kinds of
experiences
that have
nothing to
do with
what you
think is
going on
today
now
there are
oh yeah
my friend
yeah so
he was
complaining
that his
mom
likes to
talk to
him at
length
about
these
trees
that she
goes to
visit
and he
said to
me
you know
with great
frustration
it's just
a bunch
of trees
because he
has no
idea what
trees are
for him
trees are
just
objects
they're
like
forks
or knives
I mean
they happen
to be alive
big deal
so what
you know
you can't
talk to
them
he thinks
of course
you can
easily
talk to
trees
with your
heart
and be
heard
and hear
their
replies
the
breath
of the
possibility
space
for
human
what we
call
consciousness
is infinite
the portion
of that
that the
people who
think they
know what
what's going
on
can reach
is
infinitesimal
it's
minute
they stay
in the
layer
provided by
their template
but doesn't
violate their
expectations
of normativity
reality is
infinitely
mysterious and
completely
transcendental
to human
concepts
there's no
part of reality
that fits in
human concepts
we can fit
features of
reality into
human concepts
but most of
us get this
backwards and
we think
the concepts
are complete
authoritative
tell us what
things are
and are all
about things
Ian McGilchrist's
brilliant work
in The Master
and His Emissary
and also
his magnum
opus
The Matter
with Things
details the
problems with
this
so that
thankfully
I won't
have to
though I
can you
know
give glosses
of them
thingification
kills
participation
and it's
a left
hemispheric
natural to
the left
hemisphere's
way of
being in
the world
which
doesn't like
organisms
it doesn't
like anything
that violates
its primacy
because it's
because it's
terrified
actually
that
this primacy
will be
retracted
and it
will
I mean
it thinks
it will be
subjected to
its own
form of
judgment
which is
impossible
because the
right hemisphere
doesn't do
that
it's not an
accountant
there are
no things
except in
the misguided
and self
minimizing
approach
of the
aspect
of our
minds
that is
dominated
by left
hemispheric
like
character
when one
travels
which I
have done
very little
of on the
surface of
the earth
then one
changes
which
features
of the
human
and non-human
cognitia
that one
is in
participation
reception
transformation
with
and thus
it is
the different
places on
the surface
of the
earth
the difference
for example
between a
village in
France
and downtown
San Francisco
might as well
be two
different planets
in fact
there are
different places
within San
Francisco
itself
that might
as well
be different
planets
so different
are they
if one
is surrounded
by concrete
structures
steel structures
that blot out
the sky
and
evict
nature
and regularize
perception
this has a
trenchant
effect
on cognition
consciousness
awareness
it determines
what we will
authorize
and see
similarly
if one
is in the
midst of the
Amazon rainforest
with a group
of indigenous
foragers
the world
that will
appear to you
might as well
be a different
universe
than downtown
San Francisco
humans are
very similar
you can
encounter
humans
that are
tediously
regularized
their minds
are rectangular
they evict
novelty
mystery
transcendental
features of
experience
and origin
all day long
they are
basically
buffer
off
anything
that would
violate
their
familiar
ways of
thinking
and reacting
and relating
with
experience
those humans
are like
living dead
people
their body
is alive
their mind
is a zombie
and the
infection
that turned
their mind
into a zombie
is simply
representational
cognition
which isn't
by itself
bad
but if we're
not trained
to use it
adeptly
it becomes
astonishingly
debilitating
and limiting
because it
takes over
awareness
I was looking
at a reddit
probably in
aliens
are aliens
this morning
and someone
was wondering
if there
were beings
that appear
human
but are
actually
alien
and it's
a complex
question
but
A
yes
there probably
are
there are
entities
of some
kind
walking
around
appearing
human
that aren't
but perhaps
more startlingly
there's really
no such thing
as human
beings
human beings
are a form
of space
life
we come
from space
just like
everything else
and the
aspect of us
that is human
is minute
compared to
all of the
aspects that
are not
merely human
so all of us
are much
much more
than human
infinitely
more than
human
yet
like good
obedient
humans
we are
inclined
to take
on the
limitations
of our
persona
character
potential
ability
urgent
originary
motivations
so that
we adapt
and become
normalized
now many
people
who are
common
commonly
minded
may say
things like
you're very
imaginative
or
you're an
idealist
to me
you're an
idealist
or
you're crazy
or those
people who are
shamans in the
Amazon are
crazy
or they're
just superstitious
or
they're delusional
so
okay
there are
delusions
mcgilchrist
catalogs
them
very
effectively
fairly
completely
there are
hallucinations
there is
such a thing
as paranoia
there are
hallucinations
there are
people who
have delusional
thoughts or
beliefs
all of us
are those
people to
varying degrees
but
people like
Sarah Janes
the dream
incubator
who I've
interviewed
and
Normandy
Ellis
who spent
her life
studying
Egypt
and
hieroglyphs
or
Amanda
Radcliffe
the
hermetic
the
student
of
hermeticism
mysticism
these
brilliant
souls
there is
nothing
delusional
about their
understanding
of existence
or their
ontologies
in fact
so you
have
sort of
at least
two polarities
actually you
have
myriads of
polarities
but
I'll focus
on two
right
you have
people who
are
hallucinating
or are
delusional
that's a
real thing
that happens
to human
minds
particularly
when isolated
or under
the influence
of damage
to the right
hemisphere
or metabolic
problems
or so forth
so that is
that is an
aspect of
human experience
but you
also have
people who
simply
have
insight
and to
the skeptic
these people
might be
dismissed
as delusional
but it's
actually the
skeptic
that's
delusional
in this
case
the people
who live
and demand
the primacy
of their
absurd
expectations
of normative
expectable
existence
there's no
greater delusion
than that
and that
delusion
is common
to people
who have
no brain
damage
are not
genetically
predisposed
to
schizophrenia
or
bipolar
disorder
or
you know
the vast
array
of disorders
and unique
features
of humanity
that are
pathologized
in clinical
practice
so the
important
thing to
understand
here
is relatively
simple
yes
there are
delusions
and hallucinations
and some
people
who propose
wild
ontologies
are delusional
but that
doesn't mean
that all
people
who
there's a
vast
scope
a vast
slice
of the
pie
of human
experiencers
that are
not delusional
and are
reliably
reporting
on experiences
they know
they themselves
have had
and others
have had
the
shaman
who is
true
successfully
cures
lethal
diseases
without
modern
medicine
through
spiritual
practices
this has
been going
on for
tens of
thousands
of years
the fact
that moderns
don't like
to believe
in that
is stupid
right
it's just
not true
that
can you
eat it
So we should be aware that there are at least two forms of delusion, the form of delusion
that is enchanted usually by a narrative, a model of what's going on, and the form of
delusion that admits no novelty and refuses to concern itself with anything that, quote,
doesn't exist, unquote, within the evictive, incredibly limiting frameworks of their expectation
system.
That second delusion is unimaginably common.
It exists in almost every human person, including myself, because you see, even though I am
aware of these matters and have had what I consider to be entirely authoritative, non-ordinary
experience, meaning it really happened.
I exist in a context of humans whose normalization templates affect me.
They drag me toward them like a kind of gravity.
And over time, the power of my experiences wears off and I become normalized.
Just like what happened to all of us in the transformations from infancy to childhood to adolescence to young
adulthood, etc.
Each of those transformations imposed on my expectation a more and more limited and limiting array of
templates, what is actually going on is nothing like what we expect.
Were we to be relieved of those disabling templates with which we've been indoctrinated and scripted,
any moment of common experience would be so profoundly transcendental to anything we've ever known,
that we might die of ecstasy.
We would certainly be ecstatically bewildered and terrified of the beauty of it at the same
time.
So this idea of reality is the normal stuff, the cars and the roads and the rectangles and
the boxes, that's a load of bullshit.
There's nothing true about that.
It is impossible that that is veritable, formally and conceptually.
Almost all philosophers are aware of something resembling what I'm talking about here.
So too are religious people, though they often establish basically just a different version
of the expectation templates and the ontologies.
I hope that those of you who are listening will receive this as an invitation to escape the
prison-eared array of normative expectations, thoughts, conceptions and so forth that we tend
to otherwise be trapped in and we need each other for this.
We need encouragement.
We need companionship.
We need inspiration.
We need positive observational emotion.
We need relief from negative observation and judgment.
In order to open the portals to the actual nature of what's going on, which is in fact ourselves,
we are what's going on.
All of the strangeness, all of the beauty, all of origin, all of the transcendental is embodied
and potentiated within each of us and in every organism in our world.
As I've said before, we need a mission to earth.
We need a mission to understand and recover our actual natures, potentials.
The possibility space of our humanity from the strange delusion that reality is simply that
which does not vary from my expectation over time.
Your nature, my nature, the possibility space of our incarnation, resembles nothing within
our conceptual, our common conceptual templates.
It is so far beyond them that the slightest experience of it would obliterate them forever.
We, as I've said many times, are like flowers on a world with no bees or few bees.
We are like fish on a world with no swimmable water.
And those are slight exaggerations, but they circle the central feature of our problem.
Each of my recordings is an attempt to create the portal that we can together transit.
To unsever ourselves, to reacquire the beauty and intelligence, transcendence, and ecstasy that
was natural to us as children.
It is the common field of play of those who are artistic and creative and playful.
So grateful, not for that.
So grateful to have this time to explore and remember and inspire each other.
I wish you every beautiful way of growth and healing, love, and amnesis, and joy.
I wish you beautiful dreams and amazing relationships.
Thank you for joining me.
I look forward to learning together again very soon.
Bye bye for now.
Bye bye.
Bye bye.
