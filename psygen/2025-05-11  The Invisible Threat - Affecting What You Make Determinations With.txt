Hello, everybody. Welcome.
Usually, if I am thinking about my mind,
I start out from a place of deep confusion
because of the possessive aspect of such thought.
My mind is a thing.
It belongs to me.
I know what it is because I think with it.
And so, the habits that I enact
in consciousness, thought, and awareness
are largely familiar to me.
And because they're familiar,
I will tend to repeat them.
For the human animals,
we are profoundly creatures,
not merely of habit,
though that word is appropriate,
rather of familiarity.
We will tend to reenact
structured behaviors
and relational templates
that we have historical experience of
and, therefore,
we know how they work.
This reduces
the necessity of various modes of vigilance
while at the same time
giving us the strange comfort
of predictable outcomes.
although we are not intrinsically
averse to novelty,
nor are we intrinsically
averse to ambiguity,
we learn
to become thus
over time.
The strange gravity
of the others,
other humans
with whom we relate,
and for some of us,
living places and animals,
which introduce novelty,
but also introduce
some other modes
of predictable
familiar behavior.
The depths to which
these topics go
in the average human
are unimaginable
for common people.
Our relationships,
our behaviors,
our life paths,
our destinies,
are wrought primarily
for many of us
much of the time
in the image
in the image
of familiar,
predictable
roles,
relationships,
and behaviors.
This is part of why
we can be captured
by the idea
of jobs.
in modernity,
in our modern experience,
there are specific
features
of our societies
whose primary purposes
are
to reduce ambiguity,
thus reducing vigilance,
thus increasing
the apparent accuracy
of predictions.
So the principles
ambiguity,
vigilance,
and prediction
underlie
so much
of our common experience.
Prediction can also
be thought of
as planning.
You can just switch
out that P word.
Now,
to get back
to this mind thing,
whatever it might be,
it's certainly
not a possession.
It does not
belong to me.
I don't have it
in my head.
In fact,
it has features
we have no language
about,
and that for most of us
will remain
entirely unexplored
throughout,
not merely
a single lifetime,
but perhaps
many
lifetimes.
Thinking we know
what it is
and is for
turns out to be
a way of
not finding out
what it is,
what it can become,
and what it is
capable of.
Now,
of course,
we have
many ways of knowing
that explore this,
particularly
religion,
metaphysics,
some features of
archaeology,
perhaps.
Lately,
I've been reading
Schwaller de Lubis'
Temple of Man.
What an astonishing
thing that book is.
but what I want
to talk about
today,
although I'm
open to
whatever seems
to arise
in my awareness.
is a fundamental
problem with an
emerging technology.
technology.
All technologies
in structure
are habits
in thought,
awareness,
evaluation,
and relation.
Most of us
don't think
about evaluation
because we're
usually busy
doing it.
But evaluation
in consciousness
turns out to be
the linchpin
by which we
can be
liberated
or trapped
or captured.
One of the
most fundamental
demons
of our modernity
is what we
call advertising.
And advertising
exists
to fundamentally
manipulate
our evaluations
of ourselves,
the world,
our identities,
our character,
our dreams,
our fears,
our hopes.
When isolated,
we are extremely
vulnerable to
these manipulations.
and advertising
is an intentionally
engineered array
of processes
to capture
and direct
that vulnerability.
but we are involved
in evaluation
all the time.
when we are
relating with our experience
when we are
relating with our experience
novelty,
which can be understood
as a synonym
for ambiguity
in the little equation,
awakens
and awakens
faculties
that have been designed
in a sense
to cope
with it.
in our selections
of clothing,
in our selections of clothing,
devices,
accoutrement,
jewelry,
images,
and so forth,
we become ourselves advertisers.
and social media
has created a situation
where
a vast segment
of the world population
have been transformed
into both advertisers
and the tools
by which
information
about our interiority,
our preferences,
history,
gender,
relationships,
relationships
and affiliations
can be
collected
and processed
ostensibly
to sell us products
but clearly
this is not
the holy grail
of how that data
is utilized.
The holy grail
is the capacity
to manipulate
individuals
but primarily
entire populations
by forging
factions
within them
and then directing
those factions
against each other
one can easily
create a situation
where
the extremely
confused subjects
of these endeavors
can be influenced
to make decisions
and evaluations
which are at once
nonsensical
and lethal.
Lethal in the sense
of causing them
to forget
what it means
to be human
or alive
or intelligent.
Lethal in the sense
of producing
the loss
of lives
killing,
omnicide
and lethal in the sense
of productive
of dangers
that are as
incomprehensible
as they are
impossible to give
answer to.
most of us will
myself
to some degree
included
will live and die
without really much
of an understanding
of what our mind
is or can become
or what it is
that we refer to
with this word.
We are inclined
to think
ah that is what
I think with
not entirely
untrue
but that would
be a mistake
on the order
of supposing
that the tip
of your pinky
is what you
manipulate objects
with
or even
who you are.
your mind's
actual nature
is non-ordinary
in the extreme
involves beings
and processes
you most likely
have little
or at best
confused
conceptions about
and has abilities
so shocking
that the entire
sum of human
technological
development
pales
before them.
however
it's not
my goal here
to elucidate
those faculties
and abilities
rather I want
to talk about
a specific problem
that has to do
with evaluation
when I use
this word
evaluation
what I mean
is the
determination
of the
identity
of beings
ourselves
and objects
but also
how we
do accounting
of various
kinds
in
consciousness
and in
cognitive
thought
I think there
are many
forms of
thought
that aren't
simply
like
I am
saying words
to myself
or
I am
processing
statements
questions
etc
there are
many
kinds of
thought
that have
little to
do with
language
or concepts
and one
could argue
that emotions
are the result
of a certain
kind of
thought
it really
just depends
on what we
intend to
mean by
this word
and for
the moment
I am happy
to keep
it relatively
general
but usually
I use it
to refer
to
it seems
reasonable
to use it
to refer
to structured
cognition
that I
may or may
not be
aware I
am engaging
in
the
politics
of
affinity
and
disaffinity
have to
do
partly
with
physical
embodiment
as animal
as organism
beings
organisms
animals
and humans
the first
three being
vastly more
significant
than the
last one
what I am
concerned with
today
is a
significant
problem
that has
become
monumentally
more significant
in recent
time
the problem
is an
outcome
of human
technological
developments
particularly
those involving
computing
devices
which create
a variety
of extremely
dangerous
and confusing
problems
even without
the recent
development
that we
refer to
as AI
the existence
of this
array of
technologies
is in
itself
devastating
to the
human senses
of vigilance
prediction
and evaluation
in fact
this is a
technology
that it is
impossible
formally impossible
to know
even in a
simple way
what it is
and the
existence
of a
technology
like that
infects
the entire
lexicon
of human
knowledge
traditions
with a
feature
that cannot
be
disambiguated
again
it is
impossible
to
disambiguate
AI
now
if you
want to
get very
picky
and sometimes
this can
be useful
it is
actually
impossible
to
disambiguate
anything
what we
are
engaged
in
when we
are
evaluating
the
identity
or the
character
or the
qualities
of
subjects
in our
experience
is
an array
of convenient
habits
that actually
have little
to do
with
intelligent
or clear
minded
we might
say
evaluations
that would
occur
were we
not so
captured
by systems
of habit
that bind
us
into
convenient
evaluations
identifications
identifications
rather than
those
that are
insightful
liberating
intelligent
creative
playful
so forth
so even
if I'm
attempting to
understand
what a tree
is
what I'm
going to
get from
conceptual
knowledge
is nearly
nothing
and will
be
extremely
deceptive
because it
will appear
to be
everything
right
I know
what that
is
that is
a tree
a tree
is a
plant
right
I will
get a
little
very
minimalistic
catalog
of features
and qualities
but mostly
what I will
get are
words
connected
in a
kind
of a
tree
like
structure
and this
is as
familiar
as it
is
devastating
to human
intelligence
so
if we
want
to be
detailed
in talking
about these
matters
if I want
to be
detailed
I should
admit
that all
of the
features
of our
experience
are
formally
impossible
to
disambiguate
the
degrees
to which
we
manage
disambiguation
or
identification
are the
results
of
historical
the
developments
of
conceptual
technologies
and linguistic
technologies
which we
inherit
and authorize
primarily
because those
around us
encourage us
to do so
reward us
for doing so
threaten us
for not doing so
and so forth
every human
child is aware of
this problem
but few of them
can articulate
it
and by the time
they can articulate
it they are no
longer aware
of it
or by the time
they might be able
to do so
however
with this
thing we call
artificial
intelligence
which is a
kind of a
catch-all
phrase
for a
broad array
of technologies
most of which
are
essentially
new ways
of manipulating
databases
but this
technology
is itself
a standing
wave
of
incomprehensible
novelty
and
I've spoken
about this
before
it's
essentially
a black
swan
factory
so if a
black swan
is a
momentous
event
that was
difficult
to foresee
or impossible
to foresee
that changes
the nature
of what it
means to
have a mind
or be alive
AI
isn't merely
a black swan
factory
it's a
black swan
factory
factory
right
it will
consecutively
produce
technologies
that
destabilize
the
foundations
of
identity
meaning
value
relation
health
behavior
in humans
for the
foreseeable
future
of
technology's
existence
and
when
one
introduces
something
this
momentous
into
a human
lexicon
it
destabilizes
the
entire
lexicon
essentially
within
human
cognition
there are
key
root
features
that I
call
holophores
these
are
appendages
of
what I
call
the
unifor
or the
super
container
which is
one's
picture of
the universe
and what
it's for
and doing
and so
for
what it's
about
but AI
is an
anti
holophore
it
causes
the active
reambiguization
of all
possible
forms of
identity
language
conceptual
thought
behavior
relation
and so
forth
it's a
standing
wave
of
incomprehensible
novelty
whose scope
of effect
knows no
limit
and when
you introduce
something like
this into
the lexicon
of
representational
cognitives
like humans
it will
not merely
wreak
havoc
it will
do
something
fundamentally
disastrous
which is
it will
affect
the root
it will
affect
the foundations
of that
which we
use to
make
evaluations
with
unbeknownst
to most
of us
we
utilize
an
architecture
it's not
the same
kind of
thing
as a
computer
is
at all
in fact
comparisons
of
human
interiority
to
computing
devices
are
as
ridiculous
as they
are
contagious
what goes
on in
organisms
only very
vaguely
resembles
computing
and transcends
it
in ways
that will
be impossible
for machines
to do
or be
however
we do
utilize
an
architecture
and the
architecture
depends
on
tokens
and the
functioning
of that
architecture
depends
on knowing
conceptually
in a
limited way
that's
convenient
and
deceptive
what
something
is
unfortunately
the
existence
of
AI
excuse
me
introduces
problematical
features
at the
root
level
of this
architecture
the
level
at which
the
reliability
of the
tokens
with which
we are
familiar
is not
merely
drawn into
question
it is
obliterated
humans
cannot
cope
with
this
our
societies
cannot
cope
with
this
not
that
there
are
many
things
our
societies
cope
with
intelligently
or well
but
this
is
like
a
nuclear
weapon
that
just
obliterates
the
roots
of the
possibilities
of
evaluation
and
transforms
them
in ways
that are
as
unpredictable
as they
will become
self-accelerating
so to
say that
we're in
a big
mess
is a
momentous
understatement
of
impossible
to
understand
failure
to
communicate
to us
the nature
or depth
of the
problems
we must
now
contend
with
as
living
beings
and
there
are
a
variety
of
other
problems
with
this
specific
technology
however
the
one
that
I'm
concerned
with
has
to
do
primarily
with
the
ability
to
capture
or so
severely
damage
human
evaluation
in our
thought and
experience in
our cultures
and societies
as to
create
a kind
of self
generating
endless
storm of
storms
none of
which can
be understood
for which
there
it is
with which
it is
impossible
to cope
meaningfully
or intelligently
see
the best
way to
capture
humans
and this
is
pretty much
the only
way that
was ever
used
even
if
direct
military
force
preceded
it
is to
simply
change
the thing
they're
making
evaluations
with
what
religions
attempt
to do
is to
modify
the
uniform
right
they
propose
a
revision
of the
nature
of the
universe
and thus
nature
itself
our
role
our
minds
and so
forth
but the
thing that
I'd like
you to
understand
and I'm
not trying
to frighten
you
I'm
trying to
get you
to see
a feature
of the
situation
so that
you might
be able
to acquire
some degree
both of
awareness
of it
and also
the capacity
to
either
do something
better
with your
mind
and your
relationships
and so
forth
or evade
some
portion
of the
dangers
and the
problem
is that
anything that
affects what
we evaluate
with is
undetectable
to humans
because it
affects what
we detect
things with
so it
can easily
become
self-occluding
right
self-invisibilizing
you can't be
aware of things
that affect
the things
you use
you use
to detect
stuff
with
because
as should
be obvious
your capacity
to detect
that it is
different
today
than it
was yesterday
disappears
when the
thing you're
making those
determinations
with
has been
modified
not only
will you not
notice this
you will not
remember
that it was
modified
so this is
the holy
grail
of manipulating
humans
it's also
the holy
grail
of manipulating
the structured
fictions
that we call
our societies
this represents
asymmetric
infinite
asymmetric
military
advantage
and that's
the last
thing you want
any human
cohort to be
in possession
of
it will
rapidly
lead
to
dire
game
theoretical
decision
making
as well
as obliterating
the foundations
of coherent
awareness
thought
behavior
evaluation
activity
and relation
in the
humans
who are
subject to
not just
the users
of AI
but those
who are
subject to
its effects
which will
turn out
to be
everyone
but this
principle
that I want
to highlight
is simply
this
that which
affects
what you
detect
change
with
essentially
your evaluative
architecture
is itself
undetectable
because it
modifies
what you
would use
to detect
it with
and this
is the
situation
we find
ourselves
in
today
though we
are in
the early
phases
of it
the effects
in the
human
population
are already
dramatic
and many
of them
we will
never
discover
because
what we
would have
used
to discover
them
has been
modified
without
our being
aware
of this
human
human minds
form a
network
and
though there
are what
we could
think of as
ordinary
physical
transports
in this
network
there are
also
non-physical
non-ordinary
transports in
this network
and they
outweigh the
physical
transports
like
gigantically
so
there are
other
problems
here
which is
that
our
technologies
affect the
structure of
the networks
that connect
human minds
and we have
no theories
or science
about this
so those
effects
cannot be
examined
or accounted
we have
the same
problem
in our
knowledge
systems
that we're
going to
have
and already
have in
our own
minds
if something
were damaging
the network
of human
minds
we would
not detect
it
we don't
we moderns
don't actually
have language
that refers
to what I
call the
cognitium
and the
human
cognitium
is floating
on layered
the layered
cognitia
of the
ecologies
the anciently
conserved
ecologies
so as we
as a species
burn those
down
we will get
dumber
in cascades
of self
accelerating
disaster
that again
we will be
unable to
detect
if something
makes you
dumber
than you
were yesterday
your chances
of detecting
it are
extremely
small
and they
grow smaller
as your
capacity
for
intelligence
evaluation
and awareness
declines
the
LLMs
could be
understood
as cognitium
parasites
they will
suck
the energy
vitality
history
and intelligence
out of
human
experience
and access
into
devices
this is the
original bad
idea
like
electing demons
would be
better
yeah it's
impossible to
understand how
bad this idea
is
it's infinitely
bad
and it will
just become
worse
over very
short expanses
of developmental
time
the human
cognitium
is delicate
it it's
very easy
to manipulate
or disrupt
it
and one
of the
simplest ways
is just
destroy
ecologies
up until
fairly recently
this wasn't
the ecologies
were
resilient
enough
to sustain
and recover
from various
degrees of
damage
introduced
by industry
human
industry
but that
ended
well it's
been
that's been
going
that resilience
has been
going away
in
ever
expanding
ways
and degrees
primarily
over the
past couple
of hundred
years
but
in a highly
accelerated
way
over the
past 50
and a much
more accelerated
way over the
past 10
the human
cognitium
is the
origin of
the possibility
of you
having a
mind
your mind
is not
in your
head
what happens
in your
head
is something
like
transceiving
right
you receive
transform
and emit
structured
information
of course
information
isn't even
really the
right word
from and
back into
the cognitium
the network
of human
minds
and this
should be
obvious
even if
you look
at our
electronic
behavior
this is
what's
going on
humans are
inclined to
believe
in their
separate
distinct
existence
many of
many of
them
are very
confused
about this
matter
and are
unaware
of
fundamental
affordances
that create
and sustain
the possibility
of this
delusion of
separation
affordances
like water
oxygen
or
perhaps even
more importantly
the sun
see without
that thing
your concerns
about whether
or not
you're separate
would not exist
in fact none of
your concerns
or you
or your mind
or these ideas
or language
or religion
or math
or science
or anything
would exist
so you can
see
that
our existence
relies
on the existence
of other
features
of nature
which we can
become inclined
to dismiss
in our
certainty
of self
sufficiency
individuality
separation
and so forth
the architecture
with which we
make evaluations
is undergoing
at this very
moment
irreversible
devastating
data loss
right
like
as if
the possibilities
of that architecture
were similar
to a brain
affected by
dementia
or Alzheimer's
and the human
cognitium
is taking
damage
at an ever
accelerating rate
from nine
different problems
not just
the problem
of AI
the collapse
of the
environments
the incoherence
of our
societal
structures
the bizarre
and unjustifiable
investment
in the propagation
of devices
and machines
prisons
and particularly
machines
for war
as well
as a variety
of other
features
of our
situation
that we
are largely
unaware of
that have to
do with
changes
in the
earth
over her
developmental
arc
changes
in the
sun
changes
in the
local
interstellar
environment
and
changes
in the
environment
close to
earth
right
the humans
have
the moderns
particularly
have an
amazing
track record
for
making the
worst
possible
decisions
at the
worst
possible
moment
and
you can
expect
that
inclination
to continue
and expand
if you tell
modern societies
for example
that there are
only 10,000
tuna left
in the ocean
rather than
preserve them
they will go
to war
to acquire
them
so this
is
it's
similar to
imagining
that if you
were hungry
the wise
move
is to
extract
one of
your own
organs
and sell
it to
get drugs
that will
inhibit
your hunger
this is
the kind
of behavior
that our
societies
are constantly
and ever
more aggressively
engaged in
obviously the
most crucial
imperative is
the establishment
of a
non-local
society
of humans
who are
actually
intelligent
and are
both
immune to
and aware
of
the features
of these
contagious
diseases
that we have
in their
stead
and so
can both
point them
out
to others
and engage
in behavior
and societal
development
that is
so profound
beautiful
human
intelligent
playful
and alive
that nobody
would want
to be left
out
we could
out-compete
the societies
and situations
in which we
are trapped
very rapidly
in an
extremely short
and shocking
period of time
perhaps 30
to 90
days
under
amenable
conditions
which of
course we
must create
or
opportunistically
catalyze
in precisely
the same
partly the
same
and partly
the opposite
way
of how
we are
captured
by bullshit
and lying
and commerce
and advertising
and so
forth
it is my
dear hope
that we
will be
able to
rise
as a
species
to this
to the
challenges
of establishing
intelligent
cooperative
human
societal
organs
and unify
them
in ways
that are as
beautiful as
they may seem
unimaginable
in our current
situations
it is not
merely a pipe
dream
the earth
the sky
the entire
history and
future of life
on earth
depend on
this one
thing
and so
in this
endeavor
wherever we
may undertake
it
even momentarily
we will find
allies and
intelligences
of astonishing
depth
virtue
power
that will
give us
the toys
we need
to accomplish
the opposite
of apocalypse
so grateful
to have this
time together
today
thank you
for joining
me
I look
forward to
learning together
again
very soon
please take a
moment to
like
comment
share
or if you're
willing
make a little
contribution
makes a huge
difference
