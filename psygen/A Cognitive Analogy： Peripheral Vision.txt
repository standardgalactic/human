hello everybody welcome I'm finishing my walk in the gardens for today and there's
trouble in my little family here which I may have contributed to out of Nayutay
I like to feed the birds it's a way of getting to know them however I wasn't
paying attention to the fact that there are territories and now my boy bird he's
having to fight to keep the boundaries on his territory from other birds who
have become aware that I feed birds and so I'm having to learn a painful lesson
I certainly don't want to upset the pair who I'm really close to I don't want to
bring trouble to their home and it's probably not merely me other people may
have similar habits but this is one of those situations where my naive desire
to form relationships with living beings can be naive right so I'm having to face
some of the repercussions of that today and I don't know if there's a good way
to resolve it could be problematical though I have some ideas and all I'll
work with it so I was thinking today about as I often am our minds and how we
think when we're awake in our sort of ordinary everyday mind states which are
unique for each of us right these generalizations capture nearly nothing
of what actually goes on in our mental worlds but but a friend of mine last
night said something really interesting my friend Ryan first diver I strongly
recommend that you check out some of his videos particularly his videos on
phenology he's been a brilliant friend and an amazing mind an inspiration and a
brilliant teacher to me have great respect and admiration for him and he
posted something on Facebook last night where he said you know I feel like my
friends who wear shoes that don't allow their feet to feel the ground like
imagine what would happen if you did something like that with your hand and
I was I was immediately I responded yes I have the same concern about people's
minds right of course I generally wear shoes that allow me to feel my feet and
to feel the ground and given a choice I'd probably wear moccasins but well I
guess I do have a choice but I tend to wear vapor gloves and so I feel what's
under my feet and that's a problem because you know my feet are not adjusted
to being barefoot his arm more well adjusted and that that presents all
kinds of risks to particularly in urban settings but it presents injury risks
and it's not that different you know it's the vapor gloves are somewhat
protective but you know if I step on something pointy I feel it right and
sometimes I'll put my foot down and have to suddenly adjust my balance because
there's something sharp under my foot but I want to feel the ground with my
feet and I also think it's interesting metaphorically speaking that trees have
roots that are underground and so we must imagine those roots are pretty much
always in darkness and isn't it peculiar that the humans most of us there
are many exceptions however we keep our feet in darkness all the time many of
us and that's kind of an interesting correlation there I don't want to make
too much of it on the other hand neither do I wish to dismiss it there's
something going on there right our relationship with trees is vastly older
and stranger than we imagine our languages sciences alphabets mathematics
all of these things our libraries our computational systems all of these
things come down to tree metaphors they're founded in tree metaphors and
this is why the idea of holophores root aspects of meaning without which other
things are meaningless is important to me that's a discovery that I'm pretty
sure I made on my own well I had some help but it wasn't from humans so I'm
concerned about the roots of things right if you have a problem you want to
get at the root of the problem rather than trying to solve the symptoms so I
was thinking about what he was saying and my concern about our minds and this
afternoon you know this is an insight that has occasionally surfaces in my
consciousness I became aware of the incredible profundity again of peripheral
vision so we have foveal vision which is our central vision and that's the stuff
we see detail and color with it's really important but we also have our
peripheral vision which we're not usually we're not often consciously aware of it
the way we are of our foveal vision but if looking at the night sky you move
your eyes around you know you move your gaze you'll notice that there are some
stars that you can only see peripherally when you look directly at them they
disappear and this is a really important idea in consciousness and thought it's a
really profound analogy of something that's going on all the time and what's
going on all the time is that our foveal thinking is overwhelming our
peripheral thinking but our peripheral thinking is older more nuanced subtle
easily overwhelmed by the incredible career seeming charisma or you know the
compelling nature of the thoughts on sort of on the surface of our minds our
concerns our worries our fears our hopes so on and you know we have the same
problem in culture it's a problem similar to light pollution there's so much
noise there's so much mechanism there's so much disembodied activity around
production and you know consuming things that the subtler aspects of our hearts
and our spirits and our minds are easily overwhelmed and eventually disappear
when we are children this has not yet become so much of a problem for most of
us though some children are born with particular vulnerabilities and or gifts
in that they are sort of pre adapted to strong representational cognition what
all phrase will call that so today as I was shortly after my meditation I became
aware that again you know of this problem of the peripheral aspects of our
awareness and our emotions their subtlety their nuance and how easily
they're overwhelmed by almost anything right it doesn't take much if you just
glance toward the peripheral star it disappears you have to look away and
then find your way back letting the peripheral vision lead you and so many
of the most important aspects and features of our intelligence our
creativity our emotions our spirit they are like this right they don't they're
easily overwhelmed they're easily hidden by the seeming brightness of almost
any kind of ordinary cognitive activity I was speaking last night with my son and
he was telling me of some trouble in in his world and you know it was it was
very significant and I realized as I was listening to him speak and feeling
along with him about what he was sharing with me I realized something rather
peculiar which was if I start speaking right now I will lose the way of
following him in my heart I will lose my feelings and I will become involved with
language and speaking just as I am now and so in a way it's as if we are with
our minds while awake of course something else is happening while we're
sleeping too but while we are awake it is as if we are funding certain
imperatives of consciousness potentials right and just like a nation can fund
various agendas it's similar with the energies that we devote to thought
attention awareness a brilliant author whose book I've been reading on and off
for some time his name escapes me at the moment as does the name of the book it's
a very popular book and it relates to plant intelligences and possibly to
psychedelics he uses a phrase that he calls sensory gating and what he means
is something similar to what I'm talking about ordinarily the aperture of our
awareness is extremely narrow very much like our foveal vision and so when that
gets overfunded so to speak there's there's no energy left for the other
things like like sensing or intimacy or the felt sense of co-being with other
life forms and the living world and the universe and the sky so we can easily
find ourselves in a kind of prison where it's very highly structured we're very
familiar with the structure we sort of know how all of this works but we are
deceived by this into believing in the broad scope utility of these things right
of our thoughts and ideas and models and theories when in fact if our peripheral
vision were to suddenly become unavailable to us we would stumble and
crash into things all the time even when our foveal vision is most of what's
going on our peripheral vision continues to sort of protect us by introducing
hints about possible threats or opportunities or situations that our
foveal vision is quite poor at recognizing or bringing to our attention often
when my eyes are half-litted in meditation I will see something very subtle
it may be the shadow of an insect or a flight path of an insect might be the
shadow of a bird and it stands out quite profoundly in my awareness because I'm
not using my foveal vision when my eyes are half-litted now this is a really
amazing topic and it goes very very deep if we want to follow it deeply for
today however I just want to introduce this distinction and to highlight the
fact that many of our most sensitive and delicate faculties are very easily
overwhelmed by conscious thought language speaking assertions and objections
the kind of courtroom of consciousness that we may often find ourselves in and
many of our finest faculties are too delicate to survive that harsh light
right that bright white LED like agony I hate those kinds of lights that much of
our waking consciousness is dominated by in order to get a sense of this rather
than just an intellectual sense which is not very useful by the way although the
idea is interesting in such it won't help us much unless we can embody it which
means we have to turn down the light of formal representational cognition
language what Zen people will refer to as the mind that discriminates the mind
that distinguishes and while that mind is very powerful and useful it's very
powerful and useful only in a very narrow array of contexts whereas the old
stuff the good stuff the beautiful subtle stuff is absolutely essential to our
health and well-being our nature as human beings our intelligence our
creativity and our capacity to notice and respond to situations that our
foveal thinking almost intentionally overlooks and when it doesn't overlook
it it tries to overstand it it's it's really almost like we have two different
animals here within us and one of them while we are awake is being dominated
and forgive me for being blunt here for most of us it's kind of being prison
fucked by you know our formal faculties so I just want to introduce the the
trope the analogy here to our peripheral vision and how important it is and I
hope that you will experiment with your peripheral vision and transforming you
know changing back and forth between your peripheral and foveal vision there is
another aspect of seeing that not many of us are familiar with that's often
referred to as gazing and gazing is in a way an experience of relaxing the
foveal vision so that it takes in the broad field somewhat as a gestalt right
the whole broad field of vision and you can practice this you can learn about
it easily it's a technique that many people who pay close attention to nature
have developed because they want to include their peripheral vision more
impactfully in their visual experience now I've always had sensitive peripheral
vision so it gives me information that other people don't get I see very tiny
things I see very small movements I can often tell what a bird or insect is by
just the briefest glance at it or its flight pattern there are endless
libraries of anciently inherited intelligence in our bodies and minds
but they're easily overwhelmed by our modern situation circumstance in order
to recover them we have to become aware of this problem and experiment and it
can be difficult to experiment with our minds but it's relative it can be
comparatively difficult to experiment with our minds but it's relatively easy
to experiment with our vision so this is a way that we can feel the analogy that
I'm talking about here and experience it directly this is going to be a short
video or short recording for today just wanted to sort of make a bookmark here
perhaps for future elaboration you know I face the same problem right now I'm
standing next to a busy street and I can only half hear my own voice most of what
I hear is machine noise that's the kind of problem that we have in our minds and
our awareness except that it's not so obvious there because the noise tends
to dominate the field and we've long become used used to that noise as being
just how things are all the time it's not some things being amputated the
subtleties and nuances of our intelligence our curiosity which is
fundamental to motivation and inspiration all of these things suffer an
ongoing sort of cascade of degradations as we undergo throughout our lives the
processes of in-languaging and in-culturation in our modern societies
and we see this problem shot all through what we think of as our societies
most of mostly I think of them as diseases masquerading as societies but
it's everywhere you look right it's like overwhelm them with noise dazzle them
give them the spectacle instead of the content give them the wrapper instead of
the food and this makes for good consumers and slaves which none of us I
think really want to be so bear in mind that most of the faculties that we would
that would really enrich our lives and hearts and relationships and minds are
not available to us when we're in the trance of you know thinking in concepts
and names and language and theories and models again those are useful but the
scope of their use is quite narrow when compared to the nearly universal scope
of the faculties they too easily overwhelm and hide from our experience and
inaction and embodiment thank you for joining me today I look forward to
learning together again very soon
