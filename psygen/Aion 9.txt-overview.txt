The text discusses humanity's confusion regarding its own nature and intelligence, suggesting that this stems from remnants of past experiences with other intelligences. It proposes that religions and fantasies about aliens are echoes of ancient interactions with higher-order intelligences. These encounters have left traces in our languages, which contain encoded histories of humanity’s cognitive evolution.

The author argues that humans inherently seek to bridge gaps—be it in knowledge, communication, or understanding—and this is reflected in both cultural symbols (like the cross) and linguistic structures. Languages are seen as artifacts of these gap-crossing experiences, holding structured metaphoric history that remains largely unrecognized.

Furthermore, the text critiques humanity's reliance on analytical prowess and technology to discover intelligence, noting that it overlooks more profound relational and mutual aspects inherent in life on Earth. The author suggests that our quest for understanding intelligence is flawed because it fails to recognize its accessibility and vitality within nature itself. Instead of relying solely on mechanical analysis, there is a call to reconnect with the deep mutual relations that originally gave rise to human consciousness and language.

In summary, the text invites reflection on humanity's misunderstood relationship with intelligence, urging us to recognize our embeddedness in a living universe and the vital connections we share with it, rather than seeking external or mechanical explanations.
