The passage you've shared delves into the concept of fictional collectives — groups or entities we form around certain ideas or technologies that often overshadow our true potential as humans. These collectives are described as golems, an allusion to a creature in Jewish folklore made from clay and brought to life through mystical means but ultimately lacking humanity.

Here's a breakdown of the key themes:

1. **Fictional Collectives**: The author suggests that society often rallies around constructs or ideologies (like political parties, consumer culture, etc.) that may be disconnected from genuine human values and ecological harmony. These are compared to golems — powerful yet potentially destructive entities.

2. **Critique of Modern Technology and Society**: There's a critical view on how technology and societal structures have become dominant forces in our lives, often alienating us from more meaningful connections with each other and the environment.

3. **Passive Participation**: The text criticizes passive engagement with existing systems (e.g., voting) without striving to create better alternatives that align with true human values and ecological sustainability.

4. **The Need for True Community**: There's a call to establish communities based on noble, intelligent, and authentic principles rather than serving the interests of impersonal or destructive entities.

5. **Hope in Children**: The passage ends on an optimistic note, suggesting that children inherently possess the vision for a better world. This implies that rekindling this vision could guide us towards more meaningful ways of living together.

The overall message is a call to action: rather than passively accepting the status quo or fighting against overwhelming systems without direction, we should strive to create communities and societies that reflect our highest human values and potential.
