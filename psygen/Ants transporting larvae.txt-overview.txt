The text describes the future of a termite colony led by a queen. The queen mates once during a specific flight where she collects sperm to use for her entire life. She continuously lays eggs throughout her lifetime. After this mating flight, the queen loses her wings and establishes a new colony with the offspring from that single mating event.
