The passage appears to be an excerpt from a reflective and philosophical discourse, possibly delivered by a speaker during a video or live presentation. Here's a brief overview of its themes:

1. **Philosophical Exploration**: The speaker discusses profound concepts such as the nature of time ("the interval between them has become so long"), human consciousness ("the noise of reason and rationality and logic and conception, language"), and our relationship with nature and the cosmos.

2. **Human Experience and Consciousness**: There's a focus on how modern life affects human intelligence and perception. The speaker laments that aspects of humanity have been "counterfeited" or misrepresented in modern times.

3. **Interconnectedness**: Themes of interconnectedness are emphasized, suggesting that all beings (humans, animals, plants) share relationships and experiences ("Our own people are like this but again most of these aspects of our humanity have been counterfeited").

4. **Spiritual Reflections**: The mention of "angels" and the reference to stars as ancient messengers suggests a spiritual dimension, contrasting modern scientific understanding with more mystical interpretations.

5. **Nature's Wisdom**: The speaker admires nature—trees, animals—and hints at learning from their communal behaviors ("hitchhike on each other sensitivities").

6. **Call for Engagement**: The passage ends with an invitation for audience engagement, encouraging listeners to ask questions and participate in further exploration of these themes.

Overall, the speaker seems to be advocating for a deeper understanding of humanity's place within the natural world and urging a reconnection with more holistic or ancient ways of knowing and experiencing life.
