I'm just going to bird walk a bit, which is a word that we use to indicate traversing a variety of possibly unrelated threads or a seemingly disorganized,
wholly  installment
One of these animals today that's probably a male and it's separated from most of the other animals.
They're pretty spread out at the moment which is kind of unusual.
But this one in the far west as the sun is beginning to set is clearly vigilant.
And perhaps is experiencing something analogous to trance.
Now when I use the word trance I'm speaking of something, I'm speaking of a general class of phenomenon in consciousness.
Or what humans refer to as states of consciousness yet this is not a particularly apt idea.
And is much like attempting to talk about states of water.
Which again isn't impossible or useless.
But what you have with water and with things that are flowing aren't exactly states.
States imply stasis.
And what you have I think with both consciousness and water are phenomena that resemble.
Gotta think carefully for a good word here.
Phenomenon that resemble modes of flow.
And when we think about waking consciousness there are myriads of modes of flow.
The same is true of dreaming consciousness.
We think dreaming always refers to the same thing this is a mistake when we think this way because it doesn't.
There are a vast array of kinds of dreaming if we want to examine the unique forms within the general class.
The same is true of trance. The same is true of waking consciousness.
The form of consciousness used when performing a math problem is not the same form of consciousness that appreciates for example the fabulous beauty of this organism.
And it's surrounding symbiotically related organisms and the sky and so on.
And that's a different kind of waking consciousness from the type that I'm using now to organize and produce vocalizations in English.
One might even argue that although when we are making language we're using a very similar kind of consciousness.
There are a vast array of different kinds of available consciousness within the language making kinds.
So that I have experienced forms of language making where as if I were possessed by something beautiful.
Poetics I could never write emerged spontaneously from me and were I to attempt to record those.
That would change the situation and it would be much more difficult if not impossible.
Even if I succeeded it would not be the same thing that would have happened had I not attempted to record them.
And I suspect as a poet that this kind of possessed impassioned mind that I've very occasionally experienced and wondered at may have been much more common to our ancestors who had no writing
and may be the origin of poetry and song.
When we are writing songs there's a vast array of different aspects or modes of the transformation of consciousness that we might experience.
Some of these can be very kind of technical, unthinky, but others of them are trans-like, emotional, beautiful.
And I think we revere musicians and songwriters because they not only are presenting evidence of having been in this form of awareness, this mode of awareness.
They're also creating an artifact or recording usually unless we're seeing something live that draws us into an experience of trans-like wonder or impassioned emotion.
And these are things we may too infrequently experience in life.
There's a hawk.
The hawk is hunting worms because the ground is very moist.
No, not because it turns out that the ground is very moist at the moment.
And that makes it easy for the hawk to hunt and eat the worms.
This is not a particularly common thing to see.
It often happens in the winter.
It's a very large hawk, probably a red tail, although its tail doesn't look particularly red.
It could be another kind, perhaps a cooper's hawk.
It's very large.
I'm just going to watch it for a few moments.
It's not that easy to show it because with the video I cannot turn the camera around while I'm making a video.
Maybe you got to see it fly.
I cannot see what I'm pointing the camera at when I'm turning my phone away from me.
One of the reasons we love music is that it transforms our consciousness.
Particularly when we resonate with it.
Although I'm from an older generation, a generation born in the 60s.
And through the 60s and 70s, what we referred to as popular music was vastly more sophisticated, emotionally, prosaically, melodically, lyrically than most of what qualifies as popular music today.
I suspect that my grandparents, my parents and grandparents would argue something similar about the music that was quote popular.
There's kind of a funny pun in that word.
We're not really a pun, some implications, phonetic implications.
In their time, they would have said, well, our music was much more sophisticated and rich in certain dimensions that they would have argued the music of the 60s and 70s was not.
It's very complicated what happens in modern cultures because over time our people became in groups and supergroups highly motivated to sell things.
This was not always the case, although the attention of human beings to acquire that attention was always valuable in some way.
But it wasn't always so expressly commodified.
It wasn't always so controlled, dominated by money, which is a representation of value.
And for some reason I find this particular image very apt.
The entrance is barred by steel.
One cannot come and go freely here.
One has to either belong here according to some groups' assertions or purchase their way in.
As human consciousness became a target for marketers, the depth and richness of our lives has been profoundly compromised and embedded in contexts that are really toxic.
Particularly the context, the contextual agents that marketers and advertisers comprise.
The primary purpose for which we are studied by corporations is to attract our attention to learn how to garner our attention and to transform that attention into the commodity of cash.
Now I would argue that in the 60s and 70s particularly there was a profound kind of renaissance of incredible creativity and poetics in popular music.
This isn't to say that the poetics was missing before that, rather it had different forms and pivots around which it orbited.
The commodification of music and art seems to me a tragic result of our consistently accelerating march into modernity.
There are, however, secret hidden makers and beauties that never get sold. Art that is rarely seen, private things, personal things, songs that are never recorded.
Many of the most beautiful things that have ever emerged from my mouth in terms of poetry there is no record of.
And in many cases there was no ostensible audience other than being itself or the universe or something like this.
Perhaps some of the most beautiful and intelligent things that have ever been done by human beings left no trace for the marketers to appropriate.
And this to me seems appropriate because the most beautiful aspects of our humanity and our intelligence are like small children sometimes will be very shy.
They know there's a world that will turn them into commodities and objects and artifacts, abstractions.
They know there's a world that is hungry to consume the essence and to kill, in a way, the beauty and the intelligence of our humanity.
And this to me seems largely the result of the commodification systems that have unfortunately dominated our culture.
They are purveyors of representations of value.
And on the one hand we might argue there's nothing but representations. This is a not-unuseful argument to explore.
On the other we might argue or assert that all these representations are the dead sort of shells of something essentially not merely alive but more than alive.
The origin of being, the pulse of the origin of being and all these things we make in our supercultures.
And even in our work and jobs and the things we consume and purchase, our cars, our clothing, our homes, if we have them, if we are quote lucky enough to have such things.
And certainly those of us who live in the west are much more likely to be quote lucky in this way.
That we will have a box within which we may be maybe capable of feeling relatively safe for the moment.
And a car with which we may be able to travel to other places.
And clothing and computers and smartphones and all of the accoutrements of modernity.
We have taken on the shells of our cultures, not entirely unlike hermit crabs except that the shells they acquire generally once we're living
And the shells we acquire are almost, of course our houses were once mostly living trees, that's important.
But most of the things we make are comprised of elements that are, I don't know how to put it, not particularly, not merely the remains of living things.
But living things had to die to produce and extract and create and shape and transport and sell them.
So this is fairly grim.
But to return to circle back to where I began, there are many different kinds of conscious phenomenon.
And when we speak of being awake or dreaming or being in trance, we're not talking about one thing.
Although we may believe we are because language is deceptive in this way.
It allows us to encompass a range of phenomenon, give it a name and then believe that we have a grasp upon it.
This is deceptive.
We should resist that sense, we should resist that feeling.
We should become aware of it and resist it because the profound diversity of our experience is excused and hidden away by habits in language
that very few of us will ever have the opportunity to become aware of
and therefore very few of us will ever have the opportunity to evade or escape.
I would like for all of us to have this opportunity.
I want more of us to have the ability to understand some of the dangers and traps implicit in what I refer to as formally representational cognition.
Which is the kind we are given as children.
When someone might say we inherit it, another might say we are infected with it,
someone else might say it is foisted upon us or forced upon us.
Some might use more violent language.
We believe it to be a gift to teach children
Most of us will do two things with our children and we are relatively forced to do these things in our cultures.
The first is to inculturate them, to introduce them to the various branches of cultural identity and meaning and activity that are prevalent
in the time they are born.
It wasn't very long ago that you would never see an infant or a small child with a computer in their hand,
looking into their hand unless they were marveling at the astonishing beauty and sophistication
of this very profound appendage.
Of course, it's not very long ago at all that no adults were interacting with computational technology.
This is a really new thing and it's become astonishingly pervasive.
And I would argue it's a trans induction phenomenon.
The reason that I would argue this is, well there are many reasons,
but I resisted having this technology for a long time.
As someone who watched the transformations that the introduction of computers and emails
and then cell phones and then smart phones produced in human beings and human relationships,
as someone who studied this phenomenon very closely and carefully,
I was extremely suspicious of this technology and I remained in us.
But I would argue that it's a trans inducing technology and one of the reasons I would suggest this,
although this is not merely what it is, it is not merely that,
is I remember the first time I brought my iPhone out into the world with me
and I paused to look at something on the internet on my phone.
And as I did that because I am unaccustomed to it, I was shocked.
I, the world disappeared.
My memory of myself disappeared.
My consciousness changed so dramatically in an instant from a single seemingly modest behavior
that I was absolutely staggered.
And I realized that the things I had been observing in other people,
the things I'd been concerned about in what I'd seen in other people's behavior with these objects
was not only,
let's just say my concerns could not have encompassed the intensity
of the transformation in consciousness I experienced
when I took out my smartphone
and looked up something on a news site
and I was completely blown away at the intensity of that immediate transformation
and it validated what I was concerned about that this technology is profoundly dangerous.
And yet, though it is dangerous,
it allows me to create something,
a record, an artifact
in which we can explore these dangers
and think about them together.
And perhaps learn to deal more intelligently
with aspects of our modern situation
that are lethally dangerous.
I believe it was in Greek
that it was proposed metaphysically
in a parabolic analogy
that at death or at least before birth
we are dipped in the waters of the river Lethe, L-E-T-H-E.
And this is the river of forgetting.
It washes away the memory of previous lives and experiences.
And much of our modern environment,
socially, technologically, relationally, vocationally
is lethal in the sense that it causes forgetting.
And the arts of memory that once existed and flourished
prior to the existence of writing
while not entirely lost
have been transformed, transformed, yeah?
And now we are in danger, I think real danger,
of suffering a sort of second catastrophic
evisceration of the organs of human memory
as we become more dependent on the internet
to know and re...
I can't even believe I said that.
First of all, the internet doesn't know anything.
To store.
To store encodings
that we are willing to think of as equivalent with knowledge,
which they can never be.
Machines have not the capacity to know.
Only living beings and places can know.
I reserve this word knowledge for living beings and places
and times and situations and relationships.
I similarly reserve the word intelligence for something very similar.
Intelligence is not a quality I am willing to associate with objects.
Object forks and stuff don't have intelligence.
Photographs don't have intelligence.
Photographs are not memory.
Wikipedia is not knowledge.
Knowledge is something that happens in human minds.
And there's an interesting feature of this word.
To know the ledge, know ledge, knowledge, right?
To know the edge.
To get as close as you can
to direct experience and understanding using memory.
We call the place
we travel through
to change our location.
We call it an entrance.
And it's very clear that our ancestors used trance
or something we would call this, though they did not, to travel.
And they used water, trees, phenomenon in the sky,
holes in trees or water or the earth
as beginning places.
The same way we might use a door or a gate.
There are many forms of trance
and some of them represent forms of intelligence our people have forgotten.
Not all of them require hypnosis.
Trance is something familiar to everyone.
As I mentioned, unfortunately, when people pay really close attention to their handheld devices,
they're entering a trance with machines.
And I would argue that this is lethal
because they're losing contact with their surroundings and their environment
and the living music and signals that could draw them into other forms of consciousness
far more profound than anything they can ever encounter
through the window of these light-emitting devices.
So there are many kinds of trance and there are many kinds of dreaming
and there are many aspects of waking awareness, not one.
These words are deceptive in that we think
a single word encompasses all the phenomenon.
It cannot, it shouldn't, we should resist that.
Most of us are trained in a very broken relationship
with language and meaning and identity.
And one of the people who I think is brilliant and profound
and also very difficult to understand
who can teach us about this is a man named Alfred Korzybski.
And Alfred Korzybski, and I think the 30s or 40s,
he wrote a number of books,
but in the 30s or 40s he wrote a book called Science and Sanity
which I first encountered when I was 17
and I encountered it because of the work of a
of a science fiction writer, A.E. Van Beau.
In Science and Sanity, Alfred Korzybski invites us
to explore features of language and thought that are lethal
and to, and by so doing to learn to escape them.
And I'm just, I'm not going to talk too much about him today.
But I am going to speak in a moment about a few specific pivots of his teaching.
But first I'd like you to see these Dawn Redwood trunks.
These are the trunks of trees that were damaged
by the fall of this tree here last year.
And these incredible organisms are the prehistoric ancestors of redwoods.
These are deciduous redwoods.
Their scientific Latinate name is really fun to say.
I'm hoping that these trees haven't been killed.
I think they have not.
I think we will, I will discover in the springtime what happens.
We will see what happens.
But their Latinate name is Metasequia glyptostreboides.
And these were believed to be extinct until some time I think in the 1800s
when a single living specimen was discovered alongside a temple in China.
If I remember the story correctly, the narrative discovered.
It's funny. Really, it was there the whole time.
I mean, and there may be others that have not yet been discovered.
But biologists believed that the species was extinct
because it was only known from fossils until this living tree was discovered.
And all of the trees that we know of, all of the living specimens of this tree
come from that one tree.
Korzybski, one of the important things that he asks us to question
is the is of identity.
That is a dream. That is a tree.
That is a frog.
Those are people.
These are ducks.
And what Korzybski wants us to understand
is that this is a lethal convenience.
It causes us to forget that the actual nature of identity is infinitely deep.
There's no way to properly encompass it.
He's famous for a cliché that the map is not the territory
by which he means the representation and the thing toward which it points
are staggeringly different.
The word duck is nothing like a duck.
It has almost nothing to do with the phenomenon toward which it points.
And the congruencies between the word and the concept,
because duck is an idea
that will have different meanings in different situations, even though it's a word.
There's very little congruence
between the pointer and the thing toward which it points.
The thing toward which it points might as well be a doorway to the entire universe.
It's infinitely rich in qualities.
It has no end of qualities.
If we started accounting them, we'd never finish.
Even if everyone did it all at once, we'd never get done.
Because anything is really anything we might imagine or look at or separate in consciousness,
anything we might distinguish in language or conception or modeling.
If we go to the thing that we are doing this to or with,
we will discover that it leads to everything.
And everything is transfinite in multiple ways.
It's not singularly transfinite.
It's endlessly, multiply transfinite.
So Korzybski asks us to remain aware that the is of identity is misleading.
Whatever a thing might be, it isn't what we think it is.
And it certainly isn't what we call it.
And it isn't our model of it.
And it isn't the species.
And it isn't the kind.
It isn't the genus.
These are all toys we've created in a representational layer on top of our awareness
that we've learned to transmit to each other generation to generation.
We keep transmitting this layer of ideation models, methods, categories, and so on.
Once upon a time, those may have been useful and powerful.
They're still powerful.
Those may have once been much more useful than they are today.
We may discover in time that we need to shed this representational layer
in order to make a space for something far more provocative and astonishing,
which as yet most of us are incapable of even imagining.
And I would suggest that this is likely.
And I would suggest that our ancestors were also aware.
Ancient peoples were aware of the incredible dangers of representational thought.
So that they kept that stuff away from ceremonial and ritual activity.
They kept that stuff away from it in the same way surgeons want to keep bacteria and germs out of the operating theater.
They recognized that representational thought, however useful it may be,
is lethally dangerous to an aspect of ourselves that is essential,
that is non-linguistic, that is beyond language,
that is related to song and also to trance.
To enter a place, we go through the entrance.
This is not an accident and there are many similar non-accidental hints throughout our language
about things that were once deeply understood, have now been forgotten,
and what we have are sort of the fossilized remains of understanding in our languages
and our habitual ways of referring to things conceptually and linguistically.
So Korzybski wanted us to deeply question the is of identity
and to notice that we are creatures who do this thing he calls time-binding,
which is to transfer the representational layer and habits and methods
and handicaps, disabilities that our existing cultures preserve and embellish.
We transfer these to our children and all of us underwent this process
and that is why you are able to understand the face noises I am making
in the language we call English.
Now if we remain aware that the things we refer to are not the names and ideas and concepts and models,
we have a very different form of intelligence.
If I know that I can say the word tree, but that's just a pointer to something infinitely profound,
a little bit of the lethal effect of representational cognition fades away.
And the more that I become aware that what I call things and how I think of things
is very different from those things themselves,
it gives me the option to touch the things themselves with my awareness
in a way that dismisses my knowledge, my representational knowledge.
And in that we have the opportunity to experience something like the opposite of the river Lethe.
The river of remembering, to remember, to draw into organismal union, communion,
to remember, to become remembered of and to remember ourselves and our nature
and the universe and time space and origin and being and love and essence and wonder and ecstasy.
These are things so rare in our time that many, many people will never know their natural sources
and instead will have to purchase them or purchase analogs of them.
They will buy commodities that will represent those essential aspects of our human nature and capacity
instead of touching and being remembered and remembering them together
in their moment to moment experience without recourse to drugs or electronics or
the commodities that stand between us and these things.
I know the word tree, but when I see the living being it refers to,
that being is infinitely hyper-connective with all of time space.
There is not really anything left out.
I can perceive it as a distinct organism in an ecology
but there is a fundamental aspect of our awareness and particularly our representational consciousness
that is so crucial that if we transform its meaning or if we just flip the polarity,
everything in our experience changes.
That fundamental aspect is the dichotomy which should not be a dichotomy.
I've made a little trap for myself accidentally here because I don't wish to present this as a dichotomy
and I'm not yet sure in the moment how not to do that or how to do something other than that.
But it's the dichotomy between distinctness and unity.
And if our awareness is oriented such that unity has precedence,
then the idea of distinctness is merely something we can play with.
But the polarity for most of us is set during the process of our being enculturated and in language as children,
the polarity is set on the other side, it's set on separation, it's set on distinction.
So that we think of things, right?
We think of the tree as a distinct thing, being, object, idea,
when in fact in the consciousness of unity it is an expression of all,
it's a unique, it's an entrance, right, it's an entrance to everything.
And anything that we might distinguish is thus.
From the perspective of unity, all things are expressions of a fundamental relationship.
No, it's so hard to put this in language worse.
I'm so used to the language of distinction, we don't really have good language about unity.
That we have words, you know, like community and things like this, and communion.
From the perspective of unity, all things are local expressions of the nature of origin being,
translocal identity, relational intelligence, communion, exchange, symbiosis.
So that fundamentally what you have on earth, of course it doesn't end at the edges of the earth,
it's all of time space, and even beyond that to things we have no concept for yet.
But essentially earth is one organism, one, first, first everything is one.
Then it's possible to think of things as being distinct.
But we should understand why we're doing that, why we're choosing that,
and we should have volitional, the volitional ability to move back to the perception of unity,
not just the idea of it, the almost electrical power of the direct perception of unity.
And when we have these experiences, the result is unlike anything you can imagine.
It's a form of intelligence that our people must have once had
that probably our representational cultures were born for, or excuse me, from,
but then were quickly overpowered by it, and the same thing happened to us as children, the same story,
the story of the fall, the story of Adam and Eve eating from the tree of knowledge.
These are stories of something that happened to each of us in childhood.
We started out with the mind of unity, I suggest, and I suggest this because I have memories of it,
not because it's a theory that I like.
So we started out with this mind of unity, and we were trained to use an aspect of our imagination
to make cuts in that unity, to distinguish.
And notice the likeness between this word distinguish and a word that we're all familiar with, extinguish.
To make the light go away, to make the heat, the warmth go away, to extinguish.
So there was something alive in which we participated at birth that was so intelligent
that it had the power to acquire the representational overlay from any culture we might land in.
Even the culture of dogs.
Even the culture of another intelligence from another world.
We have the capacity inherently to acquire that representational overlay,
but the aspect of our imaginations and minds that have this ability are usually essentially killed by it.
They are extinguished.
Now it doesn't mean that they go away entirely, part of how we understand meaning
depends on the survival of at least a small aspect of this essential pre-linguistic intelligence, this pre-linguistic awareness.
And many of us suffer because although we've preserved some degree of it
so that we can at least understand language and respond to statements and such,
the degree differs in each human being and it differs in each context
and contexts transform that degree, situations, relationships and so on.
They change this degree to which we are able to experience meaning
and not just have a thought, a thinky thing, a sort of computational like thing
that tells us that round indicates a circular, you know, some quality, right?
We can ascertain qualities and understand qualities implied by language,
but meaning is a different thing. Meaning is something, it's a felt sense.
It's like your heart, right?
So I'm suggesting that when we were children, first of all, I think we were entranced constantly
and part of this trance is what we call play.
And people say like, you know, will you grow out of that?
No, I don't think that's what happened. I don't think we ever grow out of that.
What happens instead is something very tragic. It gets buried, it gets extinguished
and it gets extinguished by our encounter with that representational layer of consciousness, of awareness,
which doesn't have to have that quality.
That's not the only way we can play this game that's very profound to us as humans.
Oh, this is astonishing. I'm going to interrupt for a moment of just participation,
even if only through an image, in this phenomenon.
The humans might classify this as a decomposer, but it's far more profound.
And in fact, as I said, it's an entrance. This is a way of entering everything by just relating with it directly.
It's funny. I have the urge to take a photograph, even though I've recorded this.
I have the urge to take. I do. I can help you.
If you travel either in that direction and go past those palm trees, you'll come to it.
Or if you go in that direction, you'll come to the entrance you came into where I first saw you.
Sure thing.
They wanted to know where the exit is.
And what I would like for us to discover together is where is the exit to representational intelligence?
Because somewhere near that exit hovers that essential awareness that we had as children, right?
That was so profound that it endowed us with the capacity to acquire a representational overlay.
And that overlay eventually essentially extinguished the thing we acquired it with, although it left remnants.
And those are what we refer to when we these days talk about our imagination.
Because that's the place, actually memory, what we call memory is a feature of imagination.
Without an imagination, you can't have memory. It's not storage, right?
So today we've been exploring ideas related in my birdwalk, if you will.
We've been exploring ideas related to the different aspects of consciousness that we are familiar with from our common human experience, waking, dreaming, trance.
And yet those divisions aren't real. Those divisions are conveniences of language, right?
What's real is the actual quality of experience that our awareness brings forth.
That we become, in a sense, right?
We don't just experience consciousness, we become different kinds of flow in awareness.
And one of the best metaphors for this, but the metaphor is incomplete at best, is water or liquid or atmosphere.
When I see the flowing swirls on the surface of photographs or films of Jupiter, I imagine that a mind is not entirely dissimilar.
Somehow this resembles the activities of a mind or of awareness.
And I want us to resurrect the pre-linguistic imagination of our childhood that's represented in the Bible as Abel, who was killed by Cain.
And now is sort of banished to the underworld, which we might imagine to be the dimension of dreaming.
Yeah.
I'm so excited to be able to even have the opportunity to speak of these things.
How rare it is to be born human, but how much rarer it is to be able to understand and see through that representational overlay back in time towards its origins.
And some living people still, both peoples, indigenous peoples and such, and some individuals are gifted.
But how can they possibly, those gifted individuals are going to have a terrifying struggle?
Because they're going to have to find a way to survive having preserved some aspect of the intelligence with which we acquire the representational overlay.
In a culture that effectively despises it and turns it into stuff, makes things that you can sell out of it.
So they might be born a brilliant musician or an artist or a dancer or a poet or an orator or an actor or something we don't even have a name for.
And the culture is going to want around them, it's going to first attack them, probably.
Although some of them will be immediately celebrated, which might be just as dangerous.
Because the thing that killed the originary mind is the thing that's celebrating your fame when you're famous.
So just be aware of that, right? That thing is not necessarily your friend.
And if the power of your imagination and your preservation of communion is significant enough, it will awaken the assassin in culture and the assassin will come for you.
We have lots of stories about this. Whether or not Jesus actually happened, Jesus is a story about this.
Martin Luther King is the guy we actually know. He lived, he's real. This is a story about this, right?
If you pose enough of a threat to the existing representational culture monster or monsters or however you want to think of it, they'll come for you, right?
They'll send the assassin or they'll produce an assassin. John Lennon is another example.
There are many. There are countless women whose names we don't even remember who were just obliterated because they embodied this originary consciousness, awareness, intelligence.
And some of those women were called witches, but it doesn't matter what they were called, they were assassinated.
And they were subjected to torture and so on and so forth.
One might argue that John F. Kennedy, a man who at least envisioned the end of prisons and a man who wasn't perfect and I'm not claiming he was messianic necessarily or anything,
but he was one of the most intelligent and insightful presidents.
Now there you've got a real problem because you've got the leader of the structured fiction we call our society seeing through that society.
That's really dangerous. And right now what we have is the opposite of that, yeah? In America anyway. We've got the direct opposite of that, right?
We've got a leader who actually embodies the lethal forgetting that our supercultures represent and the pinnacle of commodification.
Commodity overtakes value entirely and overtakes meaning and intelligence and humanity and everything.
Truth suddenly doesn't exist. Truthfulness doesn't exist. Truth itself is a very, very sophisticated and subtle thing.
But truthfulness doesn't exist anymore in the current presidential context in the United States.
The light, the rhythm of the patterns of light on water at sunrise or sunset.
Is one of the most primordial and essential examples of the entrance to everything.
I am so very grateful to have been able to have this time to share with you and learn together and to reflect on these things in my little birdwalk.
And I began with no real idea of where I was going.
So we don't always have to have a plan to make something meaningful or beautiful.
And hopefully I've awakened and reminded something essential in you.
And maybe you will return the favor in dreaming, in trance, in communion, in relationship.
Bye-bye for now. Thank you so much for joining me.
Thank you for watching.
