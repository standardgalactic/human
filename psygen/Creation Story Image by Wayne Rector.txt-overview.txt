This text describes an Indigenous creation myth explaining how Turtle Island, now known as North America, was formed. A pregnant woman fell from the sky onto a turtle's back in a world without land. Geese carried her until they encountered the turtle. The turtle enlisted animals to gather soil for the woman, who planted seeds that grew into Turtle Island.

The story continues with the woman having twin boys—one good and one mischievous—born of an encounter between her and the West Wind. The twins caused a rift in their world: the good son created helpful things like food sources and tools from the earth, while the jealous left-handed brother made predators and nuisances. Their conflict led to the right-hand brother banishing his sibling to control the night.

The woman's body transformed into natural elements: her head became the moon, and her body turned into the ocean's fish. The narrative emphasizes the deep connection Indigenous cultures have with nature, viewing humans as caretakers of the earth rather than its owners. This creation story serves both cultural significance and artistic inspiration for a mural project intended to convey these themes.
