The text you've provided is a philosophical exploration into the nature of consciousness, communication, and the interconnectedness of life. Here's a breakdown of its key themes:

1. **Human Cognizium**: The speaker introduces the concept of the "human cognizium," which encompasses all ways humans communicate and exchange information. This includes not just direct communication but also indirect influences through media, culture, and technology.

2. **Thrips (Thrips)**: These are metaphorical entities or units of thought that inhabit the human cognizium. They can be seen as ideas, beliefs, or patterns of thinking that influence individual minds. Thrips can be competitive, transformative, deceptive, or even self-destructive in nature.

3. **Superposition and Time**: The text suggests a radical idea where consciousness exists beyond linear time, implying a collective pool of experiences shared across humanity. This "supercognizium" is proposed to hold the accumulated knowledge and experience of all human beings and perhaps other life forms on Earth.

4. **Interconnectedness of Life**: There's an emphasis on how individual lives are not isolated but interconnected through this supercognizium. Every action and relationship potentially informs and alters this collective consciousness, suggesting a profound interdependence between humans and other living beings.

5. **Perspective and Exploration**: The speaker encourages adopting new perspectives to explore these complex ideas, emphasizing the importance of purpose and orientation in understanding such profound concepts. This exploration is seen as a way to access hidden opportunities within human intelligence and relationships on Earth.

6. **Speculative Nature**: It's important to note that this text is speculative and philosophical rather than factual. The speaker presents these ideas as tools for thought, not as established truths.

Overall, the passage invites reflection on how deeply interconnected our thoughts, experiences, and lives are with those of others and with the broader universe of consciousness.
