The text you provided discusses concerns about how social media platforms and certain news outlets potentially manipulate content to prioritize engagement over accurate information dissemination and constructive discourse.

### Key Points Addressed:
1. **Content Manipulation**: The author argues that social media algorithms often prioritize sensational or outrage-inducing content because it drives more engagement (likes, shares), which in turn generates revenue for these platforms. This can lead to the proliferation of misinformation or less meaningful content.

2. **Impact on Intelligence and Discourse**:
   - **Emotional Reactions**: When people are constantly exposed to shocking or fear-inducing information, their cognitive abilities such as working memory and creativity may be diminished. Emotional reactions like outrage can reduce our ability to think critically and respond constructively.
   - **Social Fragmentation**: By promoting divisive content, these platforms might inadvertently isolate individuals and weaken the social cohesion necessary for collective action.

3. **Critique of Activist Organizations**:
   - Some activist pages are criticized for engaging in what is termed "shock journalism," where the focus is on provoking emotional reactions rather than fostering informed dialogue or actionable insights.
   - The author suggests that this approach can be counterproductive, as it may lead to disempowerment and passivity among their audience.

### Suggestions for Improvement:
- **Promoting Constructive Engagement**: Platforms could adjust algorithms to prioritize content that fosters constructive engagement and critical thinking rather than just maximizing emotional responses.
- **Educational Content**: Activist organizations might focus on providing more educational and actionable content that empowers individuals with knowledge and practical steps they can take, rather than merely shocking them into a passive state.

### Broader Implications:
The discussion touches on broader concerns about media literacy, the responsibility of platforms in shaping public discourse, and how these dynamics affect societal progress. It calls for a more thoughtful approach to content creation and dissemination that values truthfulness, empowerment, and constructive action over mere engagement metrics.
