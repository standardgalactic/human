hello everybody here at the my favorite place to make videos these days and I
just like to remind you all that I don't think my face is all that interesting
and since with my phone you can't really see my hand gestures and one of my
hands is held hostage by the phone
you don't have to watch the videos right unless you really want to see my
facial expressions you can just listen yeah you can just just listen maybe
while you're walking or you know whatever's going on whatever's happening
in your day driving if it's safe to listen while you're driving yeah you
can just you can just listen in so this is kind of cool I don't know if you can
see it because I can't tell when I turn the video I can't tell what it's focused
on let's see here but there's a big raven over by this cedar and it wasn't
too concerned about being approached by a human looks like this cedar lost a
big branch recently I can see a place where something has cracked off from it
oh here's other members of the clan I'm trying to point as best I can at the
at the phenomenon at the beings I'm gonna show you one of our fountains here
because it'll be useful in a moment this is let's see I cannot see well enough
there we go so this is one of our one of the fountains in the garden you can see
there's a there's a central cavity there and I noticed a couple approach the
fountain and start to fill their try to fill their bottles from the the drinking
nozzles which was perfectly natural because they haven't seen anything like
that fountain before but the central cavity is designed to fill bottles right
so it has a button underneath that you put your bottle in there and just push
the button and it'll fill vertically whereas trying to fill your bottle
horizontally is going to be very challenging and difficult and possibly
confusing so I was hoping to use the fountain to rinse my hands off and I
approached them the man had already filled his bottle quite with a great
difficulty from the from the fountain nozzle and the woman was going at hers
and I explained to them I said you know pardon me I just thought I'd let you
know this cavity in the center is for filling bottles immediately the man's
face turned red and he was kind of a tough looking guy but I think he was
hurtful I think they may have been German I often encounter people from
other countries here because San Francisco's a tourist destination the man
the man's face immediately turned bright red and he said oh you must think we're
totally stupid I said no I I didn't I just presumed that you hadn't seen an
arrangement like this before and being unfamiliar with it you wouldn't
understand that the central cavity is for bottle filling I didn't seem to
relieve his concerns much I'm using the santic dope the santic to introduce my
topic today which is imagination you see when I approached the man well when I
approached the couple they were engaged in a private activity between them and
so they were experiencing you know a private moment right they weren't very
concerned about being observed but once I showed up they're they're sort of
social aspect awakened and now they knew they were they were not only were
being observed but had been being observed I just walked through some gnats
that are attracted to the tone of my voice so when I walk through these
little swarms they often land all over my face or my head they like the the
resonance or so I imagine now the man imagined he tried to simulate what I
might be thinking and he was concerned that you know oh we must look very
stupid to you but I'm not motivated in that kind of situation to evaluate
people's intelligence what is dripping down from this tree in order to
understand sorry I didn't mean to give you the view up my nose in order to
understand what is dripping down from this tree I have to imagine things and
hmm some of it actually dripped on my finger but I don't see anything that
could be dripping down from the tree of course what I imagine is essentially
since it's a very warm day I can't imagine water dripping down from the
tree I imagine that there's an organism up there you know
evacuating digestive and fluids and such right but I I didn't succeed in
discovering what the source of the dripping things from the tree were of
course I don't want to spend a great deal of time on it since I'm making a video
see when I hear that sound I imagine
motorcycles because that's the sound that I associate I mean that's that's the
image that I associate with that sound that's a learned response someone who
had never heard engines or motorcycles couldn't possibly have that
imagining so one of the things that we do as human beings primarily because I
think we're profoundly social organisms is we imagine we try to imagine anyway
the how we may be perceived by others this is very complex topic and quite
profound because it motivates and inhibits us from all kinds of learning
and orientation behavior perspectives activities we often may some of us will
do things in hope you know with the hope of receiving the positive attention of
others that means we were imagining a future moment in which the positive
attention of others the reward of that positive attention will be directed
toward us and when engaged in things that we might imagine are frowned upon or
not encouraged in our experience of other human beings and the societies in
which we live we can imagine receiving the the negative attention of for example
our peers or the members of some group to which we may be long which could be a
religious group or a political group we can imagine being punished we can imagine
law enforcement officials taking over the rest of our lives so on so forth so
we imagine future states whether consciously or subconsciously and these
both motivate and inhibit us there are certain things that we might ordinarily
do which we will not do because we recognize that we would receive the
the negative attention of other people or punishment or harm or even just
judgment and it's funny that the guys go to it's totally ordinary but it's funny
that the gentleman with whom I was speaking his go-to concern was oh my god
this guy must think we're completely stupid but that was no part of my
motivation right I was actually simply trying to be like I had a number of
motivations if I look back right post-hoc after the experience when we look
back hindsight is a very astonishing aspect of something we use our
imagination for and by the way the reason that I'm talking about imagination
right now my purpose is that this off maligned whatever it is this word refers
to which is often maligned in in colloquial colloquialism such as it's
just your imagination or you just made that up or you know you're only you're
just imagining things right if you couldn't imagine things you wouldn't
have a mind in fact oh there's one of the pipe find swallow tails that's very
interesting because I have a cocoon at home and that pipe find swallow tail must
have very recently emerged pretty sure it's a pipe find not positive though in
any case if you couldn't imagine things you wouldn't be able to understand
anything and your intellect would not work whatever whatever these words
refer to is this very it's both fuzzy right in that so Fregge a philosopher who
I guess maybe was in the late 1800s I might have that wrong he wrote this this
essay its title has been translated in various ways the title that I have in my
book on the philosophy of language is on sense and nominatum n-o-m-i-n-a-t-u-m on
sense and nominatum and when I say the tree right I'm using a token or a sign
to refer to something that hopefully can be experienced by others nearby for
example that so the tree is can be understood to be the nominatum of the
sign or token I am using in an act of reference in language so the token
points at some phenomenon or situation or circumstance or quality or
characteristic or activity in verbs point it processes nouns pointed things
and languages both useful and very dangerous because it confuses the hell
out of us we confuse the terms with with the things to which they refer we
confuse the terms with completeness we think when I say the tree I've completed
I know everything about once I can name it I know all there is to know about it
right like oh the bird the bird you know in the child's mind and the mother goes
it's just a sparrow and the next time the child sees the thing he's like oh the
sparrow right but it takes away a sense of wonder and mystery and
imagination naming can very often demagicalize our experience so that
believing that we now have a grasp upon it our imagination no longer relates
with it in a way that is nourishing and profound and effusive and evocative
perhaps I might even use the term romantic and some of us will say well
that's in advance right we don't want to just go around imagining things yeah but
that's not there's a there's a useful concern expressed in such language but
there's a blue jay right next to my head there's a useful concern expressed in
such language but it's entirely misguided in that again it's framing
imagination that with which it actually forms its concern as something we would
like to put reins on right we'd like to put a a muzzle on that thing we'd like
to avoid giving it too much liberty and certainly the faculties that that
imagination brings to consciousness of course I'm gonna have to back up the
faculties contain dangers though so I'm gonna back up because we have these
words like consciousness awareness imagination these refer to very they are
not like the word tree right in that the word tree refers to something
external to me that I can lay hands on yeah I can validate that the tree exists
as a physical structure and I can use both conceptual thought and language to
distinguish a specific tree from the trees or the land or the living beings
or the objects categories are very important in language in ways that I'm
not I'm not going to attempt to elucidate today because it would lead me on a
birdwalk but the nature of our categories and our relationships with them in our
minds with our minds determines many features of what it is possible for us
to have experience of so when we change the meaning scope or lexicon of
fundamental categories we are transforming what is available to our
perception imagination experience relation and so on so these words like
consciousness imagination awareness cognition by the way I was tapping
fingers while I was doing this they're very important in that they're most of
you know they represent a good portion of what we have to refer to mental
activity though we have other we have adjectives like wonder and awe and
reverence and disgust and hatred and love and things like this that refer to
feelings but feelings are an aspect of conscious experience except possibly
accepting what happens to us in dreams well at least one of my friends is
unwilling to call what happens in dreams experience because he wants to do
that he wants to segregate that into that which is experienced while awake but
these words refer to things we can't lay hands on their names for aspects or even
for the the whole of our mental experience so consciousness can be
understood to refer to all of our experience though there are some people
who would say things like well no that refers to experience of which we are
aware right that with that upon which we can consciously reflect there's
different ways to use these words and people with different purposes will use
them differently but what I want to point out is that they're quite vague
they're fuzzy it's not clear exactly what it is they refer to the
nominatum of these words is malleable yeah it may you know in some conversations
it will include some aspects of mental experience or activity in other
conversations others in some it will just be very vague and a kind of casual
term like the term mind what do we mean by this but what I want to point out is
that all of the faculties that shape our awareness oh wow what is going on here
so I doubt the camera will capture this phenomenon but it's essentially raining
under this tree and I can't tell what is producing that so because of the light
and the angle of the light I'm able to see what looks like very small droplets
though they could as easily be dust as liquid raining down from the tree
and I don't know
there's a there's an amazingly I'm gonna presume it's probably dust but once
again in order to do so I have to imagine things so our often maligned faculty
that we call imagination has a lot to do with how we first of all in order to
understand something in order to understand the words I'm speaking or to
form your own you have to use your imagination there's pretty much nothing
that we do with our minds intentionally and even unintentionally consciousness is
sort of the it can be thought of as the produce of the engaging of our
imagination with memory and phenomena around us or within us I may feel pain
suddenly in for example my ankle I will refer to my memory and think back and
try to determine if I can recall injuring my ankle if I can't I may try to
imagine what what could be causing the pain so when we look at something and
we retrieve the token that refers to it the tree the bird the wind the stuff
falling down from the tree we use our imagination in an attempt to well we
can use it for all kinds of different things including
things we might not be commonly familiar with so last night I watched a video
about an animal communicator who visited a black panther actual cat at a
preserve and the panther was very disturbed angry at people and it's
certainly reasonable for people to be skeptical about animal communicators and
some of them are probably phony determining whether or not they are
doing what they say or whether they're making things up in other words lying
requires our imagination and inclinations like purposes and feelings and
intuitions and also habits of thought what we're willing to entertain you know
as an idea and that entertaining requires imagination but in watching this
video there was a lot of the male of the couple that runs the preserve was
extremely skeptical in the beginning you could hear him he was trying to say in
his mind there is a 0% chance that you can use your mind to communicate
directly with animals I've been around animals my entire life there's no you
know extra sensory perception going on I don't believe they have an interiority
like ours you know he was implying all these things and he was extremely
skeptical the animal communicator was well known and obviously pretty
skillful and I know I've known a couple myself and I have some degree of this
ability myself or at least I imagine that I do and believe that enough to you
know just say it so most of the stuff she had to say in talking to the cat who
normally wouldn't let any human near his enclosure but calmed down immediately
when she showed up apparently most of what she had to say was stuff anyone
could kind of make up right oh he's unhappy he's mistreated he's in a very
small cage he doesn't want anything to do with humans he believes that people
have expectations of what kind of behavior he's gonna do so on so forth
he's a regal noble animal an embodiment of kind of celestial wisdom so on and
so forth the kinds of things materialists would really frown on but
that also the kinds of things that people who have wild metaphysical ideas
would celebrate you know there's both sort of both sides of the spectrum right
there's the the probably wildly over enthusiastic and confused people who have
a metaphysical model and there's the people who have absolutely zero ability
to think of or relate with anything other than the raw physical situation and
what they can observe and think about pragmatically somewhere in the middle
or above the middle is what's usually going on and that somewhere is
accessible to us but we have to be both imaginative and sober in my view to get
access to dependable opportunities and understandings and perspectives that
are both pragmatic and open-ended so that they don't cut us off from the often
astonishing abilities of our human imaginations so anyway in the exchange
the woman eventually said the the animal doesn't like its name doesn't like
what you're calling it they they called the animal Diablo and the video is called
how Diablo became spirit which is really about how the name of the name the
humans were using to refer to this animal was changed but the animal
communicator mentioned that the black panther was very concerned about a pair
of kittens that were with it before it was removed from the place where it had
lived and that tiny piece of information was what convinced I mean there were a
lot of features of things that happened that convinced the man that actual
communication was going on but that was the clincher because apparently again
according to the story and we don't have the evidence in front of us we can't
examine you know the history of this cat where it lived before whether or not
there were kittens if there were two what actually happened to them if the
whole thing wasn't just kind of made up we can't really know that from watching
the video right we may have a feeling about the veracity of the people involved
and and what they're portraying but videos are made to entertain and amaze
and engage us so there's a danger that we're being misled right and the
pragmatist will notice this danger immediately because it has a shape-based
likeness with with their concerns and also their their orientation they want
to see through the stuff that would mislead us and that's a reasonable goal
I appreciate the the usefulness of a goal like that but the pragmatist or the
materialist may be disinclined to entertain the idea that minds can touch
each other and share information non-verbally simply through the faculty
that we refer to as the imagination and that's the faculty with which if it is
possible that minds can touch each other at a distance non-verbally in dreaming
in visionary states and learn from each other and transmit and receive
information the imagination is the faculty with which this occurs in which
this occurs but again it's the faculty with which the critic it's the same
faculty with which the critic will deny that this is possible or anything like
their experience or so on and so forth it's the faculty with which the critic
forms criticisms but it's also the faculty with which human minds achieve
seemingly impossible tasks in in science for example like the theories of
relativity Weinstein or the incompleteness theorems of Goetl his best
friend or the layered infinities of canter a man who believed that if we
could understand the nature of infinity it would reconnect us with the divine
intelligence from which our own mind spring a good will encounter are known
to have been in insane which means that their imaginations were not merely
astonishingly adept faculties with which they could ascertain and prove the
nature of mathematical and physical truths they were also dangerously oh
yeah here's more of the little tiny gnats that respond to the music of my
voice they were dangerously they were dangerously intelligent right they were
so intelligent that their minds were capable of imagining things that were
both unlikely or potentially could not be true or simply were not true
Goetl apparently imagined that people were trying to poison him would have his
wife taste all of his food he died of in a nation in a sanitarium I believe I
don't know what became of canter or what his particular delusions may have been
but I will not dismiss his assertion that there's a relationship between
understanding infinities and the origin of consciousness I myself have had some
experience of unusual visionary states in which how shall I put this
in which numbers and orders in numerism acquired non-ordinary connotations in a
way that led me to discover demonstrable features of numerism that were
previously invisible at least to me so these men and many women who I cannot
hear name maybe Emmy norther if I remember correctly the mathematicians
who gave us the incredible discoveries upon which our modern technology depend
these people had astonishing imaginations and very unusual ways of
relating with their imagination very sophisticated systematic ways that led
them to see patterns in information in nature in relationships that led them
to formalize those patterns and led to astonishing discoveries
imagination making things up visualizing things is a crucial underlying feature of
the nature of minds and in our hurry to dismiss certain kinds of nonsense what
we might refer to as delusions humans may become a little too excited and
throughout the universe with the bathwater when we hear stories it is our
imagination that weaves them into something we can feel and relate with
and understand and follow the thread of that requires imagination so today I'm
I'm here to sing the praises of this faculty this often maligned faculty of
our human experience while acknowledging the dangers our minds are such that
under certain kinds of stress or intoxication disease certain genetic
predispositions our imagination can produce delusions and it's not that
there are only two sides to this phenomenon delusion or prodigy right
prodigy can partake of delusion and delusion often masquerades as prodigy
it wants to be seen as a peculiar form of insight the form often a form relative
to what we would think of as the theories or discoveries of an incredibly
skillful detective delusions often masquerade as insight and in the mind of
the one deluded they take on this this appearance and this array of qualities
many of us have known people profoundly what is the right word
profoundly aroused or disturbed by the overwhelming feelings and urgent purposes
that accompany delusion some of us have experienced that directly most of us who
have many of us who have will want to insist that even once the delusion
passed if it did we were aware within its grip of a fundamental quality of in
of seeming insight that was associated with the delusion and people who have
experienced delusions will point out for example that many astonishing
scientific discoveries were initially dismissed right as delusional who would
have believed if it hadn't been proven that the energy held within physical
matter is quantitatively equivalent in some particular aspect of measurement
joules or whatever to the mass of that physical element times the speed of
light squared presuming that light actually has a speed an idea that I find at
once admissible but probably primitive I think we have the wrong idea about what
lights doing when we call what it what it when we call it's apparent velocity a
speed it is with my imagination that I question that yeah but people who have
experienced delusions will say you know well they didn't believe so-and-so you
know they just missed this person's astonishing insight about the nature of
reality to I'm just another one of those brilliant people who's not yet
understood and they may cling very fervently to this position some of
them will cling so fervently is to sacrifice their lives for it it's
unfortunate now of course no one can say for sure that there's no useful
content at all in the delusions of the people who are suffering from madness
because it's impossible to completely dismiss their ideas and perspectives and
theories and often you know if we look at them from the perspective of
psychology we will see that there's a an underlying message about the psyche of
the person in the grip of the delusion in the shape of the delusion in a way
not entirely dissimilar to how the plot description of a dream can in some cases
provide insight into the psyche of the dreamer and then again in some delusions
there may actually be a kernel of fundamental insight that if we could
only translate the figures the structure of the delusion intelligently for
which we would need our imagination we could derive some astonishing prodigious
discovery from the delusion and yet for most of us when someone comes to us in a
state of delusion we're gonna recognize and be very concerned humans are
concerned about the contagiousness of insanity as we can see by looking at our
modern cultures various common forms of insanity are incredibly contagious
thanks in part to the imagination but that's not the only thing going on I
think if I wanted to highlight one specific thing about our imagination or
what we are referring to with this word it would be that the imagination is the
source of faculties abilities opportunities that are prodigiously
diverse and profound and many of these opportunities and faculties will never
be experienced by the majority of us in our lifetimes because we've been told
stories and we've been given descriptions of what's possible and
impossible what's viable and not viable what's true what's false what's
nonsensical it's very it's very ironic that the disciplines whose discoveries
depend fundamentally on imagination disciplines like science pragmatism
critical thinking these very disciplines often submit an unjustifiable critique
of the faculty they all depend on the imagination and when the woman in the
video was communicating with the animal she was using her imagination to do so
literally she was transmitting intentionally transmitting images to
the animal and receiving images which she could then translate into things
that humans could understand in language this is a pre-verbal these faculties are
pre-verbal they do not depend on language language can directly interfere in
them because language and the use of language like I'm doing now I'm speaking
restructures consciousness the reception of language restructures
consciousness and when we're in a primarily verbal state our consciousness
is being restructured in that specific way and the the state that produces
receives processes and transmits images which is the precursor to the
technology that we call television that faculty has been lost to nearly all of
us yet I claim that it is entirely natural and available to nearly all
human beings that is that we can communicate non-verbally using our
imaginations coupled with emotions that might be understood to be the
if images are the content emotions can be understood as the
the energy that bridges the gap between presuming there is a gap we may have
that wrong between minds or crosses the separation we imagine to exist there we
don't really know there's something we don't really know about minds which is
whether they are the product of a unified field effect right if our
individual minds are like the leaves on a single tree fundamentally unified by an
order of existence that's not usually apparent to us or whether they are
distinct and we form connections which is the common narrative right that's
the that's the formal narrative that that minds are distinct and we form
connections and primarily the only way we can form those connections is either by
speaking or being in proximity to one another with you know the exception of
telecommunication so on so forth I strongly suspect the former model is
the correct one that minds are the local expression of participation in a form of
unity that the analogy of leaves on a tree isn't bad but you could use something
else like fish in the ocean where there's an apparent distinction between
each fish and yet the body of water that is the ocean unifies all of them and
they all emerge from it in it and live in it and so on dying it so on and so
forth but my fundamental goal again today is just to highlight that it is our
imagination with which we can recover explore and experience the the faculties
and opportunities of forms of awareness that would to us appear miraculous in
fact they are ordinary but because we have been so long separated from them
because we have so little experience of them and and most of our narratives
either misframe them with wild metaphysical or religious ideas or
inhibit or eliminate them with critiques and statistics though there are a few
researchers who have been using statistics in an attempt to demonstrate the
existence of not what we would call non-ordinary faculties of mind all of
these depend on the imagination the same way the ordinary faculties do the
question is can we step beyond the critical stories and the nonsensically
effusive stories to actually explore and recover the faculties that are native
to our human experience of consciousness of awareness of being of
heartfulness of wonder of poignant desire to step beyond the dry and
uninhabitable models of the societies and cultures in which we modernly
participate we can and one thing that helps us to do that is when we feel
encouraged reassured and inspired to explore without regard to who's watching
who's going to criticize even who's encouraging we can certainly find media
that encourages us to step beyond the relatively limited models of consciousness
ability awareness and our our faculties we can find material that encourages us
to step beyond that that we shouldn't trust because it's it's it's designed to
place us in a trance like state where our suggestibility will produce results
that are not actually realistic or dependable so on the one side that's a
realistic concern on the other side we don't want such critical pragmatism
that we have no chance to discover the many forms of wings that I believe our
human imagination gives us access to or is natural right the many forms of wings
that are natural to our imagination and to our visionary capacities as human
beings particularly when motivated by a deep and trustworthy inner passion for
his passion that helps the imagination across barriers and boundaries that might
otherwise seem impassable
in order to even make the video that I'm making I have to imagine viewers to
speak the words I'm speaking I have to imagine listeners so you can see just
how profound the our actual relationship with imagination is if we look
carefully at all those features of our human thought experience behavior
feelings inclinations reprehents apprehensions reprehensions and so on
all of these things our fears our desires our victories and our failures
they are all motivated and evaluated in imagination so maybe we can stop
thinking about this astonishing array of faculties potential and actual in such
a primitive way and begin to embrace the vast spectrum of possibility that this
wonderful gift of our human incarnation brings to each of our lives in ways as
unique as they are diverse
