Your piece is rich with ideas and perspectives, weaving together philosophy, technology, ecology, and personal reflection. Here are some key points to consider:

1. **Technological Critique**: You express a deep concern about the direction of artificial intelligence (AI) development. The emphasis on power and financial gain, at the expense of environmental and existential considerations, highlights a critique of how technological advancements may be pursued without sufficient regard for broader consequences.

2. **Ecology and Biophilia**: There's a strong undercurrent of biophilic thinking—valuing life, ecological balance, and symbiotic relationships among living systems. Your mention of figures like James Lovelock (with his Gaia theory) points to an appreciation of the earth as a self-regulating system.

3. **Philosophical Reflections**: You incorporate philosophical musings about value, power, existence, and morality. The metaphor of hitchhiking as a primordial principle reflects your interest in interconnectedness and mutual benefit across different scales—from microscopic ecosystems to human societies.

4. **Personal Anecdotes**: By interweaving personal stories (e.g., hitchhiking experiences), you make abstract ideas more relatable and grounded, offering insights into how these concepts manifest in everyday life.

To maintain focus on your main message—perhaps a critique of technology’s trajectory or an exploration of ecological harmony—you might consider structuring the piece with clearer transitions. You could start by outlining the primary concerns about AI development, then move to ecological themes, and finally bring in philosophical insights and personal anecdotes as examples that illustrate these broader ideas.

Overall, your writing is thought-provoking and invites reflection on significant issues regarding technology's role in our world and its impact on life's interconnected web.


The text presents an ecological perspective on intelligence, emphasizing how natural systems display complex behaviors and relationships aimed at mutual benefit and resilience. The author observes "call and response" interactions among animals, which manage tension without often leading to aggression or violence. This behavior is seen as a form of communal intelligence that enhances survival and development across species.

The text critiques human impact on nature, highlighting how rapid technological advancements have overwhelmed other species' abilities to adapt, using the example of tigers unable to cope with modern hunting methods. Human actions are described as detrimental, reducing biological resilience by replacing natural environments with structures like pavement, which diminishes living space.

Additionally, the author reflects on personal and cultural loss due to land being commercialized and divided, arguing that real value lies in life and ecological preservation. The text calls for a reconnection with nature's inherent intelligence, illustrated through symbiotic relationships in ecosystems like rainforests and oceans, despite their degradation by human activities.

The conclusion advocates for continued effort and resilience, likened to the Blackfoot phrase about old buffalo bulls breaking ice paths for starving herds. Despite some self-criticism for venting rather than providing sophisticated content, the author encourages perseverance in learning and valuing ecological insights.
