Hi my name is Darren Stevenson. You can find me on Facebook under that name in
San Francisco. I also have a website called organelle.org where you can find
some of the fossilized remains of my developmental speculations and
experience and I write a blog at wondercloud.wordpress.com. I'm very
excited I'm a little nervous because I want to give you some keys to cages you
probably have never even known that you've been trapped in and it's not one
or two cages it's like 50 or 1000 or 100 and every single human person pretty
much lives and dies inside these cages and they never get out. They're cages that
are formed of the incredibly crippling ideas about who we are, what things and
beings are, what nature is, what space is, what time is, what it means to be alive
or human or intelligent or together and these stories are cripplingly
misfounded and we are all infected with them and we sort of force each other
into these cages and nobody's got the keys you're not gonna find them in
science you're not gonna find them in religion there's no book on earth in
which you're gonna hear what I'm about to tell you. The reason that I want to do
this is that basically I like to free prisoners every kind. I am not a book
author I'm not a guru I'm not a teacher I'm just an ordinary person I'm a living
animal I'm part of nature I'm not part of nature I am nature speaking okay and
so what I'd like to do today is give you some keys that will let you out of the
cages that we've been stuck in for a long time. In order to do that I need to
change your ideas about certain kinds of things. I need to for you to stop
thinking that science is advanced and I'll show you why it isn't. I need you
to stop thinking that religion is going to connect you to any kind of divine
beings or space intelligences because it's not and it doesn't it does the
opposite right it crushes our intelligence and I want you just to
basically leave all the ideas that you've heard about what things are in
human culture and gurus and any kind of junk that you picked up just leave that
the door okay it'll still be there when we're done you don't have to be afraid
you can pick it up later. What I want to talk about right now is to help you
correct some of the horrible identity theft that we've undergone okay everyone
knows what modern identity theft means it means someone gets your identity
credentials and they use them to steal from you yeah but there's a far more
vast kind of identity theft that's been going on for millions of human lifetimes
and it's the theft that happens when we believe the ideas that our culture
teaches us about what it means to be human what the sky is what the earth is
what the sun is what the moon is what an animal is what ecosystems are and mean
what money is what language is and does. We live in these cages that are so
crippling that actually and I promise you this is true you've never tasted even
1% of your intelligence and if you were to get a taste of even 5% you'd be so
shocked and astonished and ecstatic that you really wouldn't have any kind of
interest in human culture hardly at all and you'd realize that almost all of it
was a really poisonous prison game. I'm hoping that we're gonna learn that
together today and be able to step outside of it we can still play with it
right we just won't have to belong in it anymore we won't have to be trapped in
it we won't have to serve it and be destroyed by it anymore that's really
my hope. So to begin I want you to realize that we've been conned okay and
the con started as children there wasn't any specific conspiracy involved all of
our cultures are broken they're falsified collectives that have to
promulgate deadly poisonous ideas to keep us trapped inside them now in case
you think I'm lying right you can you can take something that we think is
noble science everybody most people think science is pretty noble but you can
look around and realize we've had 2100 nuclear explosions in the last 50 years
science has given us billions of machines that we're all competing against
and losing they gave us the technologies with which we're burning down the
ecosystems which are the source of our minds bodies and intelligences and I
don't mean their source in history okay living places are the sources of our
intelligence right now like the heartbeat is the source of your own life so when
you burn the ecologies down we become catastrophically stupid which causes us
to burn the ecologies down faster and pretty soon we're just falling off the
cliff of our own stupidity into death right we need to stop that science is
not your hero okay as a as a way of knowing it's blameless but when you
when you give it to human cultures that are so misguided that all they can do is
make lethally aggressive technologies with which we have to compete against and
perish that's not good okay religion has absolutely failed every one of the
things it promised okay it's given us not contact with divine intelligence it's
given us contact with insanity which is basically fantasy stories that we made
up that terrify us or that promise us nonsensical things that are never
delivered no history of any religion ever succeeded right look look at all the
promises they made and look at our world our world is a seething nightmare of
horror and none of the religion saved it not weird not one of them all those
gurus Eckhart Tolle and Terence McKenna and and you know Osho and whoever else
you want to name they failed none of them produced even one interesting student
or one interesting development that saved anything really but they made lots
of money lots and lots of money is not interesting right so our cultures are
actually kind of like slave owners yeah they're fictions that stand above us and
crush us down while promising to be our heroes we don't have democracy we have
prisons okay we don't have education we've got stupidity rampantly running
around destroying our children's intelligence so the really weird thing
is that human culture is filled with mimetic predators these are predators
and parasites that mimic heroes and divinity but deliver atrocity death
rape murder and destruction why is that well let's find out a little bit about
it I don't want to go too far in that because what I want to do is really talk
about something a lot more beautiful why is everyone so afraid that we have to
have all these things like why why are we what are we hiding something's being
hidden by all this stuff right somebody somewhere or something maybe our cultures
themselves are really terrified that we're gonna discover something beyond
all religion something beyond all of science something beyond all the stories
we have about what it means to be human alive intelligent what progress means
excuse me somehow something is scared that we're going to become free yeah
that we're gonna have the power of our human intelligence and agreement
together within for each other right funded by the history of life on earth
and organized for purposes so beautiful and astonishing but nothing can oppose
them yeah because that's the real nature of our humanity we've been we've been
deprived of all of this and we've been isolated into like little broken pieces
that fight each other and are confused when in fact we're connected yeah we're
not just connected we're one thing but we're not just one thing with all humans
we're one thing with everything so the first thing I want you to see is
something kind of simple we're not yet intelligent we have the capacity for
intelligence beyond anything you've ever imagined and I want you to have a taste
of that I intend to help you get one but our cultures want to keep us stupid and
they want to tell us lots of fancy stories about things that they don't
deliver that they then that actually damage our intelligence and they sell
us back broken pieces of it at ever-increasing prices meanwhile the
parasites rise up on mountains of money power and blood while the common people
the living places the history of life on earth it's burned up it's burned up like
you know fuel to build that money that's got to stop now to start with I want to
help you understand why you're nothing like the stories you've been told you've
probably first of the main problem is that we have we have broken ideas about
central features of reality like time light what the Sun is what the world is
what an animal is what an ecosystem is what language is what intelligence is
what relation is in fact what separation is what unity is we have really
damaged ideas about all these things and part of the reason that they're
damaged is that just like when you compress a digital artifact like a
digital asset like a film or a video or a song over and over again and you use
bad compression you get artifacts in there right and if you keep doing that
compression pretty soon all that's left is the artifacts you don't have any of
the original content this is what's happened with most of our knowledge
ways and especially with our language there's something really astonishing in
our language I'm going to hint about briefly before I go on our languages on
on earth contain what I would analogize as the fossilized remains of contact
with some form of extremely advanced intelligence it's in all the human
languages you can see it I can show it to you and what it means is that a long
time ago when our languages were being developed we were trying to emulate
something just as you and I did when we learned language from our parents yeah
except the whole species was trying to emulate something vastly more intelligent
than anything we're currently aware of is existing I don't want you to think
about gods or space intelligences or anything like that I want you to realize
something really simple earth is like a concentrated crystal of the character
of space time what that means is everything that you see on earth is a
concentrated version of the basic how should we put it well just like if you
had salty water right and then you saw like salt crystals formed you took those
crystals out like wow that's really interesting it's a solid very
concentrated you know crystal and you taste it and it's salty yeah but you
wouldn't see that in the water right you can't see the salt in the water just
looks like water well earth is the same kind of crystal and so our intelligence
yours of mine is an instance of the intelligence of all of time space but
instead of delivering that to us we got such a tiny broken portion that we never
get any sort of experience of that and we have normally no way of contacting or
developing or allowing that to happen I intend to change that today and the
first thing I want to do is help you to correct one important idea time okay
what does it mean to be an organism how old are you how old am I how old is an
insect right so in order to help you see that we've got the wrong idea about time
I want you to think about time in a little bit of a new way I want you to
realize that each object that you can identify as distinct such as the stone
and each creature that you can see as being separate is actually an entirely
unique universe of time I'm gonna show you a little bit about how that works so
we've been told stories about the age of things by science for example science
tells us not science actually scientists right science doesn't have a voice
there's no such thing as science except as humans do it so when if I say science
tells us actually mean scientists tell us something scientists tell us that the
universe began about 14 billion years ago okay so that means like 14 billion
times of the earth going around the Sun one time and they think that the universe
began 14 billion years ago it's reasonable they think there was a big
bang they don't really know what that was and that everything came out of that
14 billion years ago and that our earth formed about 4.3 billion years ago and
that life on earth formed about 3 billion years ago all interesting numbers
here's the problem they're nothing like the truth let me explain why they're
wrong and they're absolutely catastrophically wrong the first part
of the problem is we can't actually make numbers that are anything like nature
it's impossible humans will never do it there's no computer on earth that could
help you understand the nature of the number that would represent the age of
the earth none none I'm gonna show you exactly why that's true in just a
moment what we call a year doesn't exist it doesn't exist except as an
abstraction there's no such thing as a year what they mean by a year is if you
have a human being on a planet like earth and you spin that around the Sun one
time you get one year which is approximately 12 months we know how
many approximately 365 ish days we can all understand that that's reasonable
but it's an abstraction because here's the problem earth never had one human
being on it and each individual object or being is an entirely unique domain of
temporality what that means is it's its own local universe of time now each
planet each stone each cell each organelle each virus each animal they all
have their own peculiar relationship with time that is sort of encapsulated
just for them no one else has experienced the year that you experienced
in your first year no one only you experienced that year other beings
related with you from their separate sort of or how should I put it not
separate but from their unique and distinguished positions in time but let's
look at the ramifications of this a little more closely because I want you
to understand just how old you are if you spin one human around the Sun one
time you get one human life here but what happens when you spin well right now
we've got seven billion of them well you get in one year that's seven billion
human life here's see the problem because already what we've got is more time
and that's where we've gotten nowhere into the depth of this run the very
surface of this idea right it's from the absolute surface of it nowhere can you
possibly a mat the earth isn't only three point five billion years old and
yet in one year we experienced seven billion human life here's so that's
twice the supposed age of the earth in one year just in separate human years
but here's the worst problem I mean it gets much much more deeper than this
think with me about this for a moment
each of those seven billion humans is a unique domain of time and what that
means is that when you have two of them together you get not only two human
life years but you get the relational domains of time between them and that's
not just one or two domains it's billions of domains and some of those
domains of temporality that connect those two humans are running at speeds
that are ridiculously faster than human time let me give you an example what
happens when you spin one cell around the Sun for one human life year's worth
of time well for a cell you might get I'm just gonna make up an arbitrary
figure because I can't do the actual math to tell you what the difference
between cells temporality and a human's temporality is but we can just watch a
cell and imagine that the speed of time for a cell has many factors over the
speed of time for a human so if you spin a cell around the Sun one time just one
cell you're probably gonna get the equivalent of about I'm just gonna kind
of make up a number as soon as the machines get done here
I have to compete with these right just to talk with you and we're losing this
competition you spin a cell around the Sun one time which probably gonna get
something like 500,000 cell years so and and while you're doing that that
cells gonna divide and become maybe thousands hundreds of thousands
millions of cells much like we ourselves might and so you're not just gonna get
one cell year or a hundred thousand cell years you're gonna get all of the years
of all of those cells and all of the relational time between them how much
time is that well it's so much time that you can't make a number about it
there's no way to possibly make a number about it and here's the thing if you
spend just one human okay around the Sun one time you get that one human life
here but the problem is you are 50 trillion animal cells and you are 500
trillion bacterial cells and all of the different ways that those relay so
in that one year you are more time than humans have ever imagined about any
number they've ever invented ever ever but that's still not the depth of it
because life began on earth at some point in history right and since then all
of the organisms on earth and all of their relations and all of their organs
and their cells and their mitochondria and their organelles and their bacteria
and their viruses have all been madly relationally being in time together and
so there was an origin of life on earth and that's been going on for about 3.5
billion flat years that we can count and while that's been happening life never
stopped so first of all your personal age is is is an expression a living
expression of that whole process which means number one even outside of the
exotic model I'm showing you here you're as old as life on earth so if you were
born on earth you start out 3.5 billion years old even in regular time you're
not one year old when you're one you're as old as life on earth whatever however
in whatever way you want to measure that yeah but then if you look at the the
mode of time that I'm talking about which is relational it's absolutely
factual you can see it right two humans going around the Sun one time is two
different human life years and the relationships between them and the
relationships with all of nature and everything so the first thing I want you
to see is you were conned you were told ridiculous stories about time that are
so incredibly dumb founding that they're almost impossible to escape into any
kind of intelligence the first thing I want you to realize is that you're
older than any number that's ever been made in so many different ways that you
could never finish exploring them and and just by seeing this you can see how
already the ways that we think about ordinary things like what is time what
is an animal when you're looking at an animal okay you're looking at something
billions of times the age of the universe why didn't science or religion
tell you that why didn't they show you the very simple fact that the way we
talk about time is a fiction and it's a deadly fiction because it implies totally
ridiculous things about how old we are and because we we can't understand how
old we are we can't understand what it means to be a human being or to be an
animal or to be a living world or what time space is really about because we're
just one planet in space but how many planets in space are there and for 4.5
billion years all of these planets many of which almost certainly have life
forms on them have been playing this astonishing game with time an organism is
to time okay as a sun is to light we're time stars we make billions of kinds of
time that we don't even have language that allows us to look into I'm trying
to give us some of that language now so the first thing I want you to understand
okay is that you're more astonishing than all of science and all of religion
right now right now you don't have to do anything you don't have to learn
anything more you have to be anything different just be yourself and forget
about the models of time that you were shown in human culture because they'll
destroy your intelligence once you realize that your actual age is so
astonishingly beyond the whole idea of time that doesn't even it won't even fit
inside science okay there's no religion that can contain this there's no
language that can that can express to you the unthinkable relational symphony
of billions and trillions of lives in mad furious relational development that
is just your single body right and think about the implications of this when
we when we get past this because I'm gonna need to go on to other topics the
first thing I just want you to understand it's very simple is you're older than
everything not by like 10 factors or a hundred factors you're older than
everything by a billion factors and if science ever tries to compare you to a
machine you know like like this pen and says like this machine can be
intelligent okay the weird thing about this machine is it doesn't have that
relationship to time at all and it never will it can't okay a machine is just an
object it's not relational because it's not relational it doesn't have that same
kind of time this is actually the actual age they say it is if this was built a
year ago this is exactly one year old if you were born a year ago you're older
than all the time humans have ever counted you will never be a machine your
brain is nothing like a computer has nothing to do with computation nothing
computation is a metaphor okay and it's the wrong metaphor for organisms
organisms do not have functions those are a fiction made up by people that
want you to think that you're an object you will never be an object these things
exist in flat time you exist in transcendental relational time luckily
now you have a little bit of an idea how astonishing this kind of time is and
how ridiculous the other kind is never believe the myth that machines have
anything in common with you I'll give you another example medicine if your heart
starts to die I can put an artificial heart in you okay and that might keep
your blood pumping and that might keep you alive no problem I get it but here's
the thing because your heart is living and it's forms of billions of organisms
and all those organisms are relationally intelligent and relationally
temporal in the way that we've discussed your heart has more functions than
science has numbers functions right in other words it does more kinds of
relational those actually those aren't functions that relations but it does more
kinds of relational super function then there are numbers to talk about it one
heart does that okay so when they put a mechanical heart in you that just pumps
blood what you get is a machine like this it has flat relational time relation
time age and it's not relational it does one thing and that's pump blood your
heart does billions of things think science will never discover in the next
10,000 years so to call the machine that they put in you a heart is completely
ridiculous right that would be like calling your mother I don't know what a
fork there's no way you could be born of a fork it has a function but it's not an
organism so you have nothing in common with machines and the people that want
to tell you that they're gonna build like an artificial intelligence they don't
know what intelligence is trust me they have not the slightest idea what they're
talking about our flat functions in flatly temporal a relational objects
over here with actual intelligence what you have is these time stars right that
are explosively relational in so many ways will never finish discovering them
and once you tell people and they begin to learn about their actual nature as
beings whole new forms of intelligence blossom naturally out of them because
that's what they are we were born to be to have a relationship with intelligence
the same way we have with time to be intelligence stars where whole new
forms of intelligence constantly emerge and develop and evolve and explode into
exotic beautiful expression as us but the first thing that has to happen for
that to be destroyed is we have to be told really ridiculous stories by
religion and science and gurus about what it means to be human and what it
means to be alive and what death is and all these kinds of things and once we're
told all those ridiculous stories we can basically be enslaved in them for the
rest of our lives and we'll convert our friends to them we'll argue about them
and all these kinds of things instead of discovering what's actually going on now
I want to talk a little bit about intelligence okay one of the most
shocking things that ever happened to me it nearly killed me was that I had a few
moments about three seconds of contact with the mind of an insect yeah it
nearly killed me we don't because we don't know we don't because we have the
wrong idea about what an organism is what the sun is what the earth is what
time is what intelligence is we don't understand what organisms are at all and
let me explain to you any organism that you can encounter is more than all
science by billions of factors it's more than all of religion by billions of
factors it's more than any kind of space being you've ever thought of or imagined
any organism okay an ant a slug a tick a mosquito anything it's more intelligent
and more astonishingly relational than all of human stories all of human
religion all of human computation in fact a single organism is so sophisticated
that if you take the entire history of human technological development all the
way until our species dies it will never catch up with a ladybug okay never never
partly because of what I've explained to you about time and relational time
you can't make machines they come anywhere near organism and the reason is that machines
have flat temporal a relationality that's the first problem they're not temporally
relational in the way organisms are and secondly they have functions we don't have functions we have
super functional relation and it makes explosively astonishing evolutionary development
thousands of billions of times per picosecond you're never going to make any kind of machine
that comes anywhere near an organism's complexity ever not in the whole history and future of mankind
so I want you to just forget that whole myth completely flush it down the toilet it's a lie
and it cripples you because it models you as an object and once you have that model you start
acting and thinking that way I want you to see my model okay you're a relational time star you
have in you forms of intelligence and ability so shocking that if you took the whole sum of the
stories of superheroes that would be like a piece of poopy toilet paper compared to what you were
born as and you've been lied to so dramatically and so astonishingly commonly that you've never
been able to encounter them now we're going to start playing with these things together
not to make new religions not to make gurus or books just to discover what we what it means to
be alive in nature now a little while ago I was telling you about a very terrifying experience
I had and that experience was a few moments of contact with the mind of a single insect
it was a dying wasp
I had known the hive that she was the queen of I recognized her the hive had been poisoned by
my landlord but instead of dying she went into hibernation unfortunately when she awoke she was
still poisoned her wings were gone and she was dying and she knew it I don't know why I don't
understand how it happened but somehow for a moment she touched my mind our minds went together
and in that moment she transmitted a vision of information a visionary form of intelligence
and information it lasted about less probably less than two seconds I fell down on the ground
what I experienced in that moment was so shocking that I could barely survive it
I learned more in those two seconds than in all my 36 years of life okay I learned more
in those two seconds than in 36 years of all my study and research and observation
and I learned so much more that it would be ridiculous to try to compare it so I didn't
learn 10 times the amount or a hundred times the amount this kind of information that was
just given to me as a gift was a form of intelligence so shocking that
it makes all that what humans know look very primitive and it I went into shock actually
I went into kind of intelligence shock because what I had received in those few seconds was the
history of the wasp beings on earth all of their adventures all of their battles and contact with
challenges and catastrophes in nature on earth with humanity in an instant
just one moment of transmission and please don't think of this as a download because this has
nothing to do with technology this is nature okay and the metaphors that we use in technology
are broken don't use them don't use the words don't use the language forget them we need different
ways of understanding this or we're going to stay in the same trap so what I want you to understand
is that I'm a pretty intelligent guy in my own way and I've learned a lot I study all kinds of
aspects of science and biology and nature and technology music art language my whole life yeah
so very intelligent guy I've had all kinds of unusual experiences yes I've done various kinds
of drugs and things in my life so I know what psychedelic experience is about let me be really
clear the wildest psychedelic experience that I've ever had which was pretty shocking compared to
what happened in this two seconds with the wasp that wild psychedelic experience was like I didn't
even know how to how to how to make a comparison it was a piece of garbage I wouldn't have zero
interest in it none I wouldn't even look in the direction of psychedelics ever again after one
moment contacting the mind of another living intelligence on earth so what I want you to
see really clearly is absolutely without any kind of drugs right without any kind of religion
without any kind of science you are made to contact nature in ways that you've never been
allowed to discover and if you were allowed to discover those outside of human culture
completely outside of all the models you've been told of things right you're going to have an experience
so ecstatic and so shocking and so intelligent that you're going to have a difficult time just
surviving it it will transform your mind not just in that moment but in waves and pulses
that go on and deepen over time now now since then thankfully I've had many such experiences
and with with many kinds of intelligences not just those of insects but what I want you to
be really clear about is this every living thing that you see around you
is a billion fold more interesting than what you think contact with an alien from space would be
like every single living thing a blade of grass a grasshopper a butterfly a bee a tree a mushroom
anything and I don't want you to think in the terms of the nature religions the pagans
Terrence McKenna and all those people those people are completely deluded they absolutely
failed to deliver anything except more cages throw that away forget everything you've heard okay
and the reason is you need to take off all of the lies and ideas that human culture has
implicated in you and and sort of injected into you and and forced you to believe and think and
actually just take all that off and in pure innocence and with a beautiful purpose right
go back to the sources of life intelligence relation purpose and beauty because when you do that
free of all human culture you are going to have experiences beyond anything that's ever been in
any book and after even one of those experiences just one okay you will never be interested in
reading anything about adventure because your life will become an adventure so astonishing
that no film you've ever seen even looks interesting it actually looks like a piece of junk that you
wouldn't even want to touch the same thing is true of the wildest stories of superheroes and
adventures you are more than the sum of all of human culture and not by like one or two factors
by billions of factors so what I want you to understand is the toys that human culture
gives you to play with actually destroy your mind they separate you from each other right
they separate you from nature and they separate you from the living sources of intelligence
that are absolutely everywhere believe me when I tell you a very simple thing there's no need to
travel in space okay what we have here is more than we could ever find in space travel and the
reason is that the way that space and time are organized the way that their structure works and
it's a living structure by the way is such that on every world in space all of the intelligence
of all of the other worlds is locally available no one's paying any attention because they're in
love with machines and religions and ideas so stupid that are actually that our actual intelligence
can't survive exposure to them and we just get pounded with that noise and pounded with that idea
and pounded with the religion and pounded with the incredibly primitive products of our current
science and we're told that all of these things are holy and divine and advanced it's a con game
it's a total lie you yourself are a billion fold more than that and the moment that you begin to
realize that you don't need a teacher okay you don't need a book you don't ever need any machine no
machine can deliver to you more than you yourself brought with you I promise you this is true you
will have this experience if you simply understand some of the ideas I presented here now today
particularly the one about time realize how old you are you're older than any kind of old you've
ever heard and what that means is you're more sophisticatedly relationally intelligent than
anything you've ever been exposed to and you can't be exposed to it because it's so explosively
self-transcending every instant that you could never catch up with it right no description you
could make could catch up with the incredible age and intelligence that you just keep being every
moment I mean think about it 50 trillion animal cells 500 trillion bacterial cells probably
a thousand fold more organelles which are the tiny little organisms inside cells
those things live at a rate of time that even a few seconds is probably like a year for an organelle
you are such an astonishing amazing being that no description will ever come anywhere near you
no religion could hope right to deliver what you are those things are broken toys they're the
toys of prisoners that have been trapped and crushed down so that they can be taken advantage of
by parasites and predators this is actually what the old stories in Genesis are talking about
they're talking about the fact that there's two sort of modes of intelligence right one of them
is absolutely organismal it's it's just beings and animals in relation and that form of intelligence
is so transcendental that it explosively transcends itself trillions of times per second
you want a taste of that and when you get a taste you're going to barely be able to survive the
slightest whisper of it right and you're going to be so shocked that it may take you years to recover
yeah and then maybe you'll go back for a second taste hopefully your mind will survive that
having some discipline right having like um a meditation practice or some kind of a practice
where you've built careful discipline so that you can remain sober emotionally even when you're
immersed in shockingly unthinkable waves of novelty and intelligence you're going to need a
little sobriety or it'll it'll mess up your mind right kind of go nuts but that I don't want you
to be afraid I want you to just realize as you're as you're pursuing this path choose a path where
you can build some sobriety and self-discipline because it will help you when you suddenly have
to encounter something like my encounter with the wasp and my encounter with the wasp is one of the
smallest encounters I've had right I'm giving you a tiny taste there I barely survived it and when
when the wasp gave me that gift with it came a responsibility and the responsibility was to use
this gift purposefully in a beautiful purpose that would help to redeem her suffering and death
right that would help my people our people to discover our true identity the identities that
have been stolen destroyed shattered and then they sell us back little broken representations
of them which we get like a tiny spark from and think like well that felt good but I need another
one and so we go back to the guru we go back to the religion we go back to the science it's just
those are just toys go ahead and play with them but please don't believe them right they're absolutely
lies about identity the same thing that I've shown you about time is true about animals it's true
about dreaming it's true about intelligence it's true about language what we think language is
we're completely wrong about what you think language is and I will show you in pieces over time
so we've undergone this kind of id theft yeah but it's the big theft right it's the theft of
what our actual nature in relation with the universe is I want you to be really clear about
one thing everything that you would hope to discover in the farthest reaches of space or time is right
here on earth as you as me as our living environments and notice something the parasites
and the predatory representational cultures are burning all that down they want to eradicate
the ecosystems for the sake of automobiles yeah and little computers that you hold in your hand
you're hypnotized by right this thing that you hold in your hand with a light in it it's a
representation of something something that I've rediscovered for myself if you had any idea what
this thing was a representation of you would smash this thing and you would attack everyone you ever
saw and you'd realize that's a deadly mimic we got to get rid of that right now what you call the
internet is a representational replacement for something that if you again if you touched it
once even for an instant you'd be hard pressed to survive it and the reason you'd be hard
pressed to survive is that you'd die of ecstasy ecstasy of your mind blossoming into forms of
non-human intelligence that are absolutely unimaginable to ordinary people no one has touched
them there's no religion on earth that's gotten anywhere near this and the people who wander
around telling you like they're the arcturians or the pleidian blood those people have actually
just made up a fantasy story and are lying madly through their teeth and will deliver
none of the kinds of information knowledge and keys that I'm going to give you for free
all day every day until I'm gone and believe me when I tell you I'm carrying more information
than I could possibly communicate to you in 10,000 lifetimes right I'm just trying to give you the
tiny hair right right now what I'm what I'm hanging on to so that we can just like share this little
thing taste it see how you know see how it works and learn together that's my only goal because
here's the problem they split us all apart yeah and first they stole our nature and identity then
they then they divided us from nature itself which is the source of all of these intelligences
so it wouldn't have any access to them then they gave us machines to replace those relationships
and by the way that thing that you drive around in a car that's a replacement for something you
might want to know what that what got replaced yeah because it's more shocking than if someone
gave you an intelligent spacecraft capable of translate velocity and you have one okay you're
born with one of those yeah but instead you got a motorcycle or a car and once you got the car
you'll never discover the other thing it was a representation of same thing with the models of
time once they give you a watch then a calendar you'll never discover what time is about right
and this is the same thing with all of the representations in our culture that story in
genesis about us at the tree that's about this right there's two forms of intelligence one of them
is deep and true and impossibly sophisticated if we were to encounter it it's going to seem
divine for sure there's no other way to understand it it doesn't mean we have to have religions it
just means it's so far beyond anything we ordinarily talk about that we don't know what to call it so
we call it divine fine no problem but let's not make religions about it let's discover
more and more about it and not trap ourselves in cages and not write books and make records that
freeze us with certain ideas because in order to follow these keys out of our cages we have to do
this really interesting thing which is we have to keep dissolving our ideas behind us yeah instead
of replicating them and telling them to you and making books no no no no no no no no to catch
what what this is is a following game yeah so we follow intelligence and learning and
shocking revelation forward and we just dissolve the representations of that behind us like fuel
right we're doing the opposite we stop still build a bunch of representations in front of us
and then just stay behind them yeah and those representations are absolutely crippling stupid
all of them every single one of them right so I want you to forget about human culture right
completely you can keep the the ideas but don't believe any of them realize they're broken toys
that will trap you if you replicate them and that's what they want you to do they want you to
replicate them convert your friends argue in their favor their fictions why would you argue in the
favor of a fork does it need your support really no it doesn't living beings in places need your
support we need each other's intelligence so here's what I want to get at another way our
intelligence is stolen is by separating us from nature first and giving us machines instead
and then separating us from each other and giving us ideologies instead right science religion
gurus um you know the new age uh books and fictions and fandom and rock bands and sports
right that's hilarious they build teams to to to accomplish miraculous nothing and then people
get so excited they kill each other over it really really let me tell you what that's a
representation of okay in the same way that calendar time is nothing like living time most
of the things we do in culture are nothing like what we would do if we just had each other if we
just had a deep relationship with nature because there's no way we'll ever ever be able to exhaust
the depth of those things but I want to make one thing really clear nature doesn't have a purpose
nature is infinitely purposive it generates new forms of purposive beings and moments and
possibilities billions of times per second right so if you have a purpose you're broken
you're dead in the water you're going nowhere what you need is purposive inspiration
relational uh intimacy and intelligence yeah and the capacity to to form little family like
units with those assets and then chase them forward in the development that's what nature's
doing that's not what humans are doing humans build representations and stop there and they
burn down nature and intelligence to build up the representations and make those godlike see how
that works it doesn't work so here's the last thing that I want to give you um before I wind
this up thank you for staying with me so long if you have a truly noble purpose okay a purpose so
beautiful that all living beings would basically agree and then be like yes please that's worth
chasing right what kind of a purpose might that be well it might be just the purpose of nature
herself if your purpose matches natures she'll recognize you in a sense not that she's a she
but you can think of her that way the other thing I want you to understand is that earth is an
intelligence so sophisticated you're never going to find anything more sophisticated you don't have
to go to space forget about going to space you don't need to everything we need is right here
and it's right here in such shockingly profound abundance that we've just overlooked it and we
keep looking up at the sky and going like can I go up there can I go up there can I go up there
why don't you look at what's right here because what's right here is a concentrated localized
version of everything in all the time space all the possibilities of space travel are right here
on earth and we don't need to burn up anything or make any kind of machine to encounter those
directly to relate with them to become intimate with them to learn with them they are the living
beings of our world they are the living ecologies of our world and we've overlooked them entirely
and are burning them down to make machines to fly into space which we don't have to go there
to get any of the things that we think might be out there they are here that's the nature of time
space the last thing I want to say is this a small human group five people okay reconnected
with their actual intelligence reconnected with nature with a beautiful purpose reconnected
with each other right with the body of unity this is as if this was their purpose yeah these five
people reconnected in the old way free of human culture with some sense of the corrections and
ideas that we can encounter by learning these new ways together five people can change this planet
in a month and that's what everyone's terrified of that's why we have all the representations
five people can defeat any force that human culture has ever assembled and not just defeated
they could transform it they could turn the whole thing into an asset in a month that's how
powerful we actually are that's why all of the parasites and predators are constantly seethingly
at work to crush us down and the story in Genesis is kind of about this it's a key actually the
medicine is in that first story of the tree you don't have time to explain it here but understand
this there were two forms of intelligence right and one of them was authentic and natural and
transcendental and the other one was hypothetical and could make all kinds of little theoretical
divisions like science or like language itself when we tasted this one it changed how we saw
the world and our minds and we became actually kind of paranoid which is why we realized that there
was there wasn't so much that there was evil right but we realized that it was hypothetically
possible that something could be evil maybe we're evil and then we got really scared so apparently
something really funny happened they took the leaf of one of the only plants on earth
that has a microscopic flower you can't see its flower and they hid their genitals with that flower
because they were afraid that the divine universe of intelligence would see that they'd eaten from
the tree and they then saw that it might be wrong to be naked maybe we're supposed to be clothed
like in like the animals have fur yeah and so they tried to hide themselves yeah and they kept
hiding themselves and they kept hiding themselves and they kept hiding until our day today right
we're we're completely hidden in every possible way we're buried in deadly poisonous wrong
representations that cripple us destroy our intelligence and deny us our basic the basic
assets of our humanity the history of life on earth our true nature is living beings and they
compare us to machines i want to say one other thing there's no such thing as evil trust me
evil is a trick yeah it's a trick that was played by the representational aspect of our minds
which tends to be associated with our left hemispheres right side of our body this is the
hemisphere that actually rules all of our cultures and produces all the false collectives yeah that
we're struggling with it's not bad in and of itself we need to not not don't get mad at the
left hemisphere you just need to realize it's very dangerous when it's disconnected from its sources
in nature and transcendental intelligence i want to thank you for staying with me this long we're
going to learn way more amazing things than this but with this one key about how old you are and
how old any organism that you see is i want you to understand something very simple your mind is the
actual platform of perfect contact with all of the forms of intelligence on earth it's as if earth
invented the most exquisite possible communion element right and then put this in you so you
were actually a creature who evolved specifically to unify and magnify the entire ring of
intelligences on earth and those intelligences are more sophisticated than anything it's possible
to imagine and they're like if you could imagine standing in the center of the sun there are a
billion fold more productive than that relationally right we are something no one has ever been able
to tell us and it's so exciting that if any of us get any kind of a taste of it there's nothing
that can stand in our way we will be unstoppable beautiful and we won't make war we'll make
transformation in waves of unbelievably beautiful intelligence we will save our world we will
transform our cultures we will retrieve our humanity our intelligence and our power to form
little collectives that can accomplish miracles overnight we'll retrieve it instantly right the
moment that we stop believing all of the lies and broken models of identity that our language and
our culture and our science and our religion are pouring down on our heads constantly and telling
us we're advanced by the way science tells you you're made of stardust they're completely wrong
you are the expression of the living star that is our sun you're an organ of that sun the same
way this finger is an organ of my body okay you're not made of stardust they want you to
think you're a dead object right and they're telling you it's so exciting you're made of stardust
they're making you stupid okay and they're telling you that that's advanced it's the same thing in
religion they're telling like you're the divine child they never delivered any experience of that
what they gave you was a fantasy that your left hemisphere can cling to and pretend like this
will save me from being destroyed and from being evil there's no such thing as evil evil simply means
you got it backwards you bought the representation instead of inhabiting the organism that's all
right there's no mean judgment thing in the sky at death none what's going to happen at death
is actually an encounter with pure intelligence and that's going to be like a kind of a dreaming
experience but a thousand fold more powerful yeah and the reason that i know this is that
i've had this experience not once i've had it about 15 times yeah you don't have to be afraid of
death ever again there's no evil there's no such real thing as an afterlife either what there is
is so astonishing that none of the human stories can capture it and you want a taste of that and
you want to taste while you're alive don't wait for death okay when you've seen salmon swimming
up waterfalls which is totally impossible obviously to get back to their birthplaces
that's what happens to us at death but if you do the same thing while you're still alive what you
encounter is intelligence and wonder and beauty beyond anything you beyond the sum of human endeavors
right so far beyond anything you can imagine that you'll just you'll cease to exist in your previous
form and you will be absolutely transformed by it i hope you will get a taste of what you brought
with you because this is your exploration your adventure it's totally for you it has nothing
to do with me it's not something i made up if you just get outside of human culture go get a taste
of exactly your nature your relationships in nature what we're calling nature you're going to
discover much more than i've said here you will surpass me a thousand fold that's my goal don't
buy my book don't believe i'm a guru take the take these little keys i've given you and play with
them like a child and find out what they point to because i promise you you're going to have an
adventure beyond the sum of human stories and it will give you the power and the ability and the
insight to accomplish any beautiful purpose the most important thing have a beautiful purpose
realize you're more than all the stories in language learn to escape the cages that language
and concepts build and realize those are toys not laws never let any authority stand above you
none none don't do it what you want to do is lift nature up above you and then look up
to the living beings the insects the animals the ecosystems the history of life on earth
act as the living avatar of those forces and momentums act in their name for their purposes
and you will be endowed with gifts beyond anything any religion could ever describe
beyond anything science will achieve in the next 10 000 years that is my hope that is the
inspiration that i have to share with you today thank you for spending this time with me more
to come my friends so much more bye bye for now
