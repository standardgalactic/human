The text you provided seems to explore deep philosophical and spiritual concepts related to experiencing and cultivating a sense of unity, love, or divinity—terms often used interchangeably with "God." The speaker emphasizes an emergent, personal experience of these qualities as opposed to institutionalized or systematized religious practices. Here are some key ideas from the text:

1. **Emergent Experience**: The concept of "birthing" refers to gradually fostering and expanding moments of unity or love ("slivers") in everyday life until they become more substantial and stable. This process is about personal and collective attunement rather than adhering to a prescribed set of practices.

2. **Moment-to-Moment Attunement**: The focus is on being aware and responsive to small, often spontaneous moments of connection with others or oneself that resonate with love or unity. These moments are described as "slivers," indicating their sporadic and sometimes fleeting nature.

3. **Avoiding Systematization**: There's a caution against immediately turning these experiences into structured systems or communities, which can stifle the spontaneity and organic growth of genuine connections. The speaker suggests that while structures (like eco-villages) might emerge later as resonance grows, they should not be imposed from the start.

4. **Collective Resonance**: The text highlights the importance of collective experience—attuning with others to amplify these moments. It's suggested that individual experiences are limited but can become more powerful and transformative when shared and resonated among people.

5. **Language and Expression**: There is a recognition of the limitations of language in fully capturing these experiences, hence the interchangeable use of terms like unity, love, and God. This underscores the ineffable nature of what's being described—a feeling or state that transcends conventional definitions.

6. **Transformation through Intuition**: The speaker notes that tuning into this process requires effort initially but can become more intuitive over time. It involves a deep, almost visceral connection to one's inner sense of unity and love, resisting external pressures that might lead away from these feelings.

Overall, the text advocates for an organic, personal approach to experiencing deeper connections with others and oneself, emphasizing spontaneity, intuition, and collective resonance rather than rigid structures or practices.


The text discusses the idea that systematizing spiritual experiences and divine concepts into rigid rules can strip them of their personal energy, leading to confusion and tragedy. The speaker expresses interest in how human cognition has evolved, referencing works by authors who explore the evolution of consciousness and its impact on fundamental concepts or "root elements" within languages.

The text emphasizes that damage to these root elements—such as core ideas like world, dream, mother, hand—can distort our understanding and intelligence. For instance, modern perceptions often reduce trees to mere objects for resources, whereas indigenous perspectives view them as living entities with spiritual significance.

Science is mentioned as having the potential to harm these root concepts by casting them in mechanical terms, thus stripping away their natural complexity. The speaker briefly shares a personal experience of connecting with redwoods during a psychedelic trip, highlighting how psychedelics can temporarily enrich language and perception but also cautioning that without deeper understanding, this effect might not last.

Finally, the text touches on how commercial interests ("thrifts") are attempting to capture and control psychedelic experiences, potentially reducing their transformative power. The discussion underscores the importance of maintaining a rich, nuanced understanding of these root elements in both spiritual and scientific contexts.
