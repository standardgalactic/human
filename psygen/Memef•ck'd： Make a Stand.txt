Do you think about the life you live, say this you have to?
Think about the things you did, things that they don't do
Together we can make a stand, you can tell yes or no
Cause I could use a helping hand
We'll move to the ocean
To feed off the dead
Was hoping that you'd understand
I've got a darkness, darkness
But you don't gotta hold my hand
Do you got a darkness, darkness
Together we can make a stand
First ten years didn't feel so hard
Seven after that, seemed to risk me too far
Jumped to 19, I'm living out of my car
Wrote my first song and took back my heart
Sick and tired of feeling like I'm such a loser
Sick and tired of feeling the ways I was
We'll move to the ocean
To feed off the dead
Was hoping that you'd understand
I've got a darkness, darkness
But you don't gotta hold my hand
Do you got a darkness, darkness
Together we can make a stand
Yo, yo, think about the life you live
Save as you have to
Think about the things you did
Things that they won't do
I think I'm gonna make you claim
You should make one, two
Together we can take a stand
Together we can take a stand
Together we can take a stand
Together we can take a stand
Together we can take a stand
Together we can take a stand
