The passage explores the complexities of human interaction in the digital age, focusing on how technology affects relationships and perceptions. Here are some key points:

1. **Interval Checking**: The author discusses the frequent checking of intervals between interactions on social media, which can lead to cognitive, relational, emotional, and psychological consequences. This behavior can create a sense of anxiety or unease when expected responses do not occur within anticipated timeframes.

2. **Expectations vs. Reality**: There's an exploration of how expectations formed through constant online interactions (e.g., likes and emojis) might influence offline relationships. People accustomed to frequent digital affirmations may misinterpret the slower pace of real-world interactions as neglect or disinterest.

3. **Vigilance and Suspicion**: The passage highlights how suspicion can color perception, making it difficult to reduce vigilance once triggered. This dynamic is compared to animals' instinctual reactions, such as a dog's alertness in the presence of squirrels, illustrating how deeply ingrained these responses are.

4. **Social Media Influence**: Social media is portrayed as shaping relational expectations and conditioning users to seek frequent positive reinforcement from others. This can lead to dissatisfaction when offline interactions don't match the constant feedback loop experienced online.

5. **Natural Rhythms vs. Digital Expectations**: The author contrasts natural human rhythms with the artificial demands of digital life, suggesting that those heavily engaged in social media may have different expectations for attention and interaction than those who aren't as involved.

6. **Observation Dynamics**: Positive observation is generally seen as desirable, but negative observation can be harmful or anxiety-inducing. This dual nature affects how individuals perceive their environments and relationships.

7. **Survivability and Intervals**: The text concludes with a metaphor about survival intervalsâ€”how long one can endure without essential resources (like water). It reflects on the balance between maintaining hope and recognizing limits in both literal and figurative contexts.

Overall, the passage delves into how digital interactions reshape human behavior and expectations, highlighting potential pitfalls of this transformation.


The text explores themes of human connection, vulnerability, and the impact of technology on relationships. The author emphasizes that humans are sensitive to timing in communication and need positive interactions with others. Disruptions or mechanization of natural relational rhythms can lead to emotional distress and pathology, akin to substituting real value for mere representations like money.

The narrative also touches on the importance of social interactions, referencing personal experiences at Green Apple Books and past communities of artists and writers. The author laments the loss of creative community due to gentrification, highlighting a significant gap in their life without daily artistic engagement.

Further, the text critiques technological advancements that impose gaps in human relationships and stresses the importance of maintaining rich, meaningful interactions as "oxygen" for society.

They express love for people, nature, and future generations, advocating for learning and creating together to enrich life on Earth.
