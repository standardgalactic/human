The text narrates a personal story involving cultural experiences in Africa. The narrator describes crossing three rivers to meet a man connected to their ex-wife who provided them with police protection due to fears for their safety. This man, living on a farm with animals, performed an act of power by using ancient African language to put a rooster to sleep and death, determining if the narrator was permitted to receive certain protective powers.

The narrator received three bells tied together with black, white, and red threads, each serving different purposes: invisibility (white), forgiveness (black), and initiating actions (red). The invisibility charm involved wrapping and spitting on a thread while saying specific words. However, the narrator never successfully used it and instead focused on its intended protective properties.

The story highlights an internal conflict between rationality and mystery in the narrator's life, emphasizing their fascination with African mysticism contrasted with modern skepticism. Ultimately, after returning to the U.S., personal troubles led to financial loss and a disconnection from Africa, though they later acquired another set of mystical objects during a visit to Burkina Faso.

Cultural observations include reflections on traditional practices and skin characteristics in Africa, such as the thick skin of a Melanesian chief that resisted needles. The narrative encapsulates themes of cultural exchange, personal struggle, and mystical experiences.


The text describes a group of people living in harsh conditions without shoes or bone arrows, relying on clubs instead. Their tough resilience is illustrated by their ability to run across flat rocks barefoot, producing a clicking sound with each step. This toughness extends even to young teenagers who are accustomed to this demanding way of life. The narrative suggests there's more to the story, which will be continued in future discussions.
