The text discusses the relationship between Sufism and Surrealism in poetry, focusing on how both traditions use language to transcend ordinary perception. The key ideas include:

1. **Sufi Influence**: Sufi mysticism inspires poets to transcend the external world and delve into an internal, universal realm through writing.

2. **Language as a Tool**: Writing should go beyond literal and traditional language, creating delirium and metaphorical expressions that bridge the finite with the infinite.

3. **Metaphor and Figurative Speech**: Central to Sufi-inspired poetry is the use of metaphor as an organic element that connects tangible reality with abstract concepts, revealing deeper truths about existence.

4. **Beyond Rationality**: The figurative language in Sufism seeks to convey meanings that cannot be grasped through logic or reason alone, uniting visible and invisible elements.

5. **Dynamic Expression**: Poetry is seen not as a literary exercise but as an exploration of human essence and the desire to reshape understanding of existence.

6. **Unfixed Forms**: The movement towards discovering infinite dimensions involves continuously breaking away from fixed forms, emphasizing that images and structures are inventions rather than mere representations.

7. **Inner Meaning**: In this poetic tradition, what matters is not the superficial appearance but the inner meaning conveyed through the language, with poets becoming vessels for these deeper truths. 

Overall, Sufi-inspired poetry aims to reveal profound connections between the visible world and the unseen mysteries of existence, using language as a bridge to explore infinite dimensions.
