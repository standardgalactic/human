The text describes dominance displays among male Great Blue Herons at the Socia Tree, their primary nesting site at Stowe Lake. The males are preparing to establish which nests will be used, engaging in behaviors like neck stretching and aerial chases to assert dominance and hierarchy. One large male is particularly showing off its size and readiness to defend its position if other males don't recognize his place in the hierarchy. Although these displays might seem simple as dominance establishment, they are likely more complex than just combat. The dominant bird being chased has shown resilience by returning to the tree despite multiple chases. The Socia Tree hosts eight or nine nests and has been a primary nesting site for at least a decade. Further activity from this location is unlikely in the evening.
