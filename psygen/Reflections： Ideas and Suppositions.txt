hello everybody thank you for joining me it's gonna be a bit of a mixed bag
tonight we're in the brought to experience the new moon that begins the
next moon cycle. I'm not sure precisely which moon it is but it might be so at
Tsukitsum and Blackfoot could be the moon where either the raptors owls
particularly begin mating or there's an extra season an extra moon if they
don't sometimes called the deceptive moon or frog moon and I've come to the
lake which I haven't visited in a while hoping to see whether or not the the
blue herons are whether the males are standing their nests which is something
they do prior to the mating time in order to assert their residency in one
of the nests in the social tree there is one primary social tree and there are
a couple of males sitting nests now what I'm really hoping to see isn't just the
males sitting the nests but also their dances which I've had the privilege of
seeing before and I practice some of those dances to try and understand them
viscerally there's a very large evening convocation of crows wild guess at the
flocks size here is 62 yeah it's close but right now the
the herons that are sitting nests which I can see perhaps two are not very active
they're just hanging out and it's a little chilly since there's no competition they're
not engaged in their display behavior at the moment so today's video or discussion will
be as I probably mentioned earlier bit of a grab bag not sure yet what I'm gonna
chase or talk about and I'll be visiting the the blue heron tree which appears to
have recently lost a couple of branches peculiarly unexpectedly a couple of high
branches have been lost they broke off of course we did have some intense wind and
storms here for a while not too long ago I doubt anyone could get up that tree but
the branches almost look like they've been cut off and it's interesting that next to
the social tree which is some sort of fir tree with many cones many many cones there's another
tree facing South ish it's to the right of the social tree which has many old nest is nests in
it but get reused each year yeah that tree is definitely lost a major branch off to its left
and I think there were some nests associated with that branch but the tree to the to the
right of it facing from from north of the tree facing south that tree usually has a
red tail hawk nest in it each season and so those two animals they raise their young side by side
in this possibly unusual situation here comes one of the guys who's another active observer of
animals and it's like there's a dead bird in the street hey man good to see you not sure what kind
of bird it was looked like maybe a robin so perhaps either matters have of residency have been
relatively settled already in the social tree and I missed the onset or it's so early that
there's no competition and we just have the really early the really the earliest
surters the audacious ones willing to wait and select their nests early and defend them in a
sense mostly with displays but occasionally there's some sky chasing stuff going on
and a few days ago I noticed the first yellow jacket and over the past couple nights I've heard
frogs I found a frog colony that apparently is quite large which I've I've passed where it is many
times but I never heard them until recently a few nights ago for the first time in a couple
times since and for the past couple days I've seen for the first time in memory
the peculiar insects I think sometimes referred to as field crickets or potato bugs these are
large wingless spiky-legged creatures that look incredibly fierce and might be able to get some
mandibles you know on you but are generally harmless they're just extremely fierce looking
and I've seen them out and about I saw one this afternoon and I saw one last night and frankly
I don't remember ever encountering them here in San Francisco now of course people with
backyards or who live near fields this kind of thing they're they're much better informed
about what lives here what can live here than I am because those little yards and such provide a
refuge for living creatures and plants and insects and amphibians and reptiles and birds and so on
but as I don't have a backyard associated with my flat I don't see much of that and I don't know
anyone with a backyard so these are some of my recent phenological noticings and concerns and as
I've explained in previous videos one way to think about phenology and there are many different
perspectives to approach it from is the transformations in relationships and behaviors
of plants animals insects and other fungi and microorganisms and so on over each moon cycle
each year in a specific place that one generally becomes intimate with and any place is sort of
my place but a couple of my places are in Golden Gate Park where there's a lot of life
but it's not as diverse as it might be partly because this rather than being a wild place is
kind of an invented place all of this used to be sand dunes and is now along maybe three and a half
miles from the ocean there's a swath of garden and trees and park but underneath the soil here is
sand because it used to be all sand dunes so if you lift up the loam to see what's living under
there what kind of detritivors you might find right insects that eat detritus or detritus
you'll see a few familiar creatures occasionally your wigs wood lice or pill bugs this are
sometimes called but mostly what you see are sand fleas by the thousands
it's a very interesting and peculiar ecology I remember when I first came here I thought well
this isn't this isn't a real wild place this is a place humans made but it's it's only partly true
there's an aspect of truth there and there's an aspect of confusion there because every place
there's life is a living place and so this is a living place and has the deep non-ordinary
spirit magic and nurturing medicine that living places are naturally effulgent with took me a
little while because my brain was too confused by ideas the other day on Facebook someone posted
something claiming that transcendental beings inhabit our subconscious and I thought that was
kind of interesting but I remember responding something like well I'm I think there's some
kind of non-ordinary beings that also inhabit our consciousness and the evidence of this is ideas
I guess originally when we were very small ideas must have been an astonishing experience
but as we grew up and became entlanguaged and culture aided and exposed to the layered
array of ways of structuring memory and imagination we became vulnerable to some of the the traps
and confusions associated with our seemingly peculiar capacity for formal representational
cognition and as I've mentioned previously other animals appear to have aspects of this capability
that it's not clear that they employ something similar to tokens right the way that we use words
and there's lots of interesting confusion orbiting these topics like the asteroid belt
in our solar system probably the remains of ancient planets maybe they smacked into each
other and broke up and yet remained somehow in relation even while shattered forming something
resembling a ring around the Sun primarily embodied between Mars and Jupiter
and it's interesting that we associate Mars whose moons are named
Phobos and Deimos I can't remember which one is which but I think the approximate translations of
those are something like terror and or fear and so what was the other one
can't recall at the moment
wood ducks that's not the translation there's a couple of them here
it might be like terror and catastrophe or something like this
and you know under the pressures of representational cognition
and it's relatively common for our coherent you know otherwise generally coherent
feelings of identity itself and safety predictability for these things to get all tangled up
or even shatter and in psychology we have the idea of
what we refer to as multiple personality disorder
yet it's always seemed to me well always might be the wrong word it's long seemed to me
that we all have different aspects of consciousness so that for example if I'm attending and concerned
about threats the character of my consciousness takes on a different persona in a way
and that persona is somewhat disembodied usually there are exceptions
an immediate threat such as a car bearing down on me that I hadn't seen before crossing the street
will produce a strong instantaneous visceral response that precedes any kind of thinking
but if I'm primarily thinking and of course there's different kinds of thinking and modes of thinking
we can talk about thinking for different reasons and that's why the word doesn't have
a single sense or even an explicit catalog of senses that we can depend on because we will always
mean something slightly unique and contexted when we use words but their definitions
are rarely contexted in the ways that we use them and this creates confusion because
we might think for example that a word or an idea concept is supposed to mean
a specific thing or should mean a specific thing
and when it seems to mean something else it may become concerned or upset
because now we can't tell well what is the meaning of the word
well there is no the meaning of the word
and the disembodied, decontexted definitions can't supply meaning
they only supply a glimpse into the structured records
of the protocols we use with language so rather than give meanings
and again what we mean by meaning can change in context and here I'm talking about
the senses of a word's definitions in a dictionary
these can be deceptive to the aspect of our awareness that wants a relatively complete
explicit grasp on meaning or identity or process transformation
and one of the most strange and fascinating words and concepts ideas that we have
that is constantly causing us trouble and there's a few
one of them is culpability whose fault is it something goes wrong whose fault is it
is it my fault is it someone else's fault should there be a court case
and of course from childhood we're scripted to first we may have a visceral or a fundamental sense
of something being good or not good someone being kind or unkind
an act that feels to us to be just in the sense of good and true and virtuous
or an act that feels unjust unjust wrongdoing harm
and this leads to really significant problems because in modern cultures
we're scripted to undergo uptake
of the origins
of what we refer to as our legal system
and this word is involved the the origins and roots of this word
are related to the idea of legitimacy and also of religion you can hear
these ledge sounds right leg literally oh there's a running rat
now you see i've just seen a rat
is that good is it bad is it legitimate was it a hallucination
am i supposed to see a rat or should i be not supposed to see a rat
okay there's certain little mindlets in the asteroid field of consciousness and of course
there are planets there too but where things are broken up can become very confusing
for us poor human beings mostly because the contexts in which we will encounter
ideas like courtrooms supposed to justice and injustice have largely been captured
by specific aspects of our capacity for representational cognition
primarily as they are instanced in collectives and if the collectives are mostly themselves
just representations then we end up doubling down on the origins of the problems that plague
our lives and minds
but i think it's a a terrible tragedy
that happens to us or really a series of tragedies
that happened to us in childhood as we're undergoing the processes of in language
hanging and culturation because we get imprinted with whatever the currently
popular or instanced versions
of mostly absurd
litiginous
thoughts concerns ideas processes institutions courtrooms lawyers prisons jails police
surveylers judges juries and in a way it's very difficult for most of us to resist
internalizing these things so somehow this is a really complex mess
because somehow
first
the nature of our collectivity our togetherness
is generally captured and counterfeited in a thousand different ways
primary ways having to do with money power social hierarchy ownership of property objects
ideas about rights and these kinds of things so firstly
there's a problem where the authenticity of our collectives
is lost
we're captured and then
represented to us in institutional and societal forms
and then as children we
take on the imprint of these forms
which are already like second or third or fifth or fiftieth order representations
and we internalize them creating a bizarre
sort of structured reflection
of how and why we've come into contact with these ideas and how
they've affected our our feelings our lives our relationships but particularly our interiority
our unminds relationship in a sense we could say with itself but it's not really relating
with itself it's relating with the representations
and so we end up forming little aspects of consciousness mindlets if you will
that specialize in navigating
the really bizarre terrain that results when something authentic is first represented culturally
then internalized and re-represented
in relations with our own being our own feelings our own consciousness
so that we can have the experience of being judged or surveilled
by beings that don't really exist and aren't judging or surveilling us
except essentially in our imagination
it doesn't mean no one's judging or surveilling us it just means that we're not really in relation
with those judges or possible surveyors we're in relation with the reflection the represented
reflection of our history and responses to such things
and our reactions and projections of such things
and for many of us this is a kind of torture especially when we're under stress or we're
injured or we're sick or we're isolated or we're very poor or we're homeless
or we're battered or we've been raped or abused or ignored or evicted
and so in these circumstances
these aspects of consciousness become very inflamed and they can become inflamed in all
kinds of different ways and the little mindlets can overcome with their intense scrutiny
a very specific concerns fears injustices they can overcome the coherence of our mind
and then our mind collapses into
a situation where the roots of our experience of being human
being a specific kind of human perhaps a specific gender of human
these experiences under what when dominated by for example a threat sentinel or judge
or something that's trying to determine whether something in is just or unjust virtuous or bad
these aspects of mind can overcome and dominate the roots of our being in consciousness
so that the mind now finds itself or we find ourselves in a war inside ourselves
and the soldiers of this war
the commanders and generals and soldiers and sergeants and so forth they so to speak
they are not concerned with preserving the coherence of our felt sense of being
like our institutions in our society rather than being coming truly concerned with resolving
problems they become concerned with continuing to exist and to be the aspect of mind that gets
funding funding meaning attention energy awareness
in action
and in this situation our mind is prone to collapse into
a very narrow painful and constrictive behaviors and qualities and experiences
now
usually if we were going to evaluate such a state we would say oh this is a state of
grave disorientation and that's not unreasonable but that's not the only thing that's going on
actually what's happening often is a kind of injury
and there may also be
it may we may also be seeing symptoms of of historical injury reenacted
right because if I become extremely concerned about
some kind of wrongdoing I was involved in
it is as if I'm reliving that wrongdoing
I can remember events and situations where I made decisions or choices that I later deeply regretted
and when I call these to mind it's almost as if I'm re-experiencing them so in a way
or at least from one perspective
the little mindlets they are concerned with something not entirely dissimilar to ghosts
memories of beauty or joy or comfort
memories of adventure or heroism
but also memories of wrongdoing injustice, harm, pain, suffering, fear, confusion, helplessness,
injury, illness, these things
our minds can be analogized as vehicles and the concerns
that produce specialized elements such as the threat sentinel the opportunity sentinel
and these are just some words I made up to talk about this stuff
or the relational sentinel right the one who watches over relationships
the evaluative sentinel is it good is it bad do I want more of it less of it
do I not care there are all these little sort of mindlets processes
that over time acquire their own history of origin and action success and failure
but among these one of the strangest ideas of all and it's it's not strange in that we can't
understand how it comes to be or why we might refer to it but it's the idea of supposed to
this is not supposed to be like this or this is supposed to be some way that it's not being
and this becomes very confusing and troubling for many of us
it would be nice if we had better language around all of these things particularly the
idea that we form little sub minds
so we just had some incoming an incoming
Canadian goose couple
and
taking off and landing but also flying can be a very vocal
behavior for these beautiful creatures
ancient and noble
I don't think they make sophisticated song because they're supposed to
now in a way you can see if you look throughout history
very complex relationship with the idea of supposed to
apparently humans were so confused at some point about supposed to
but either something
very powerful and surprising
carved a bunch of supposed to use into some stones and gave them to a guy with a halo
so to deliver to the people that were his people
and all throughout our religious books and our philosophical ideas there's a background
and we really need a better better language for
a background of supposed to use and not supposed to use
and one of the problems with that is that actual experience differs from rule-based protocols
rules based protocols are abstract and many of them are presumed to
it is it is presumed rather that it is proper to attend the abstract protocols
rather than having the contextual sensitivity
to be selective about which of them might get enacted or questioned or resolved
this is very confusing and very painful for nearly everyone but there are some people
who are absolutely tortured by it because for them
the abstractness can come to represent in interiorly absolute authority
and an absolute rule that is to dominate every possible context and situation
and this is why
our religions are so problematical because in many of them it's not clear whether
they started out this way but over time they became weaponized
and the evidence of weaponization is the promise either of eternal bliss or eternal torture
these promises are taken as absolute the protocols are taken as absolute
they pervade over all possible things and that collapses into an abstract rule-based system
that no living being can reasonably contend with in fact that kind of weaponization
produces various kinds of what we would refer to as madness
and sometimes the madness is angry but sometimes it's just wildly incoherent within itself
to such a degree that those suffering from it
cannot compose anything resembling coherent human mindful experience
and it's a terrifying tragedy and one we are all you know not out of reach of most of us because
when we're placed under enough stress or isolation and so on
most of us are inclined to overfund an aspect of awareness that's attacking the basis of our minds
though we cannot detect that with the minds less compromised
or we may we may have an intuition that something's wrong in our mind
but because the dominant processes are so expensive and
um
ravenous endlessly hungry for any kind of fuel or power
they can sequester capture from consciousness and awareness we can fall into all kinds of traps
where
an aspect of awareness that might otherwise if not super inflated be at least modestly useful
in coping
with trouble or loss threat or pain
um
inverts and effectively becomes the source of trouble or loss or pain or confusion
and I suspect this is familiar to most of my listeners because all of us have experienced
something like this
particularly if we are faced with a problem
something painful
for a long period of time and particularly if that problem has old old roots
in our developmental uh what we might call psychology with the development of our minds
and again I just want to mention that it's not like we have one mind although
you know depending on how we frame it and why we're looking what our purposes are what we're
curious about we'll come up with different models of mind and mindedness
usually there is a kind of relatively coherent uh should I call this
this
a root aspect of my being and identity that I think of as me right
and it it supersedes all sub functions
yet it can collapse into or toward a given sub function so that now my experience of me
rather than being broad and diverse and alive and sensitive and creative and reverent and playful
becomes courtroom like
and so in these cases I've I've collapsed into a mindlet a sub process probably one I inherited
from culture um and language but also one that whether or not it's mostly artificial
is the remains of something important
something primordial
something that was visceral before it was conceptual or represented
and this is part of how the gambit works
in our interiority
something deeply true and primordial
is first buffered so that it becomes difficult to access
and then we're presented in culture society language ideas
with something that resembles it but is a counterfeit
and this is the root is one way to understand the roots of our vulnerability to these issues
and this happens all day every day in cultures of commodity and commerce
they're hyper representational they're actually chasing dissociation disembodiment
um the replacement of a meaningful human interiority
with arrays of ever more structured technological and confusing fictions
and one would imagine that it would be brilliant if in childhood we could be educated about these things
so that we would have the opportunity
to become curious enough about them that we might overcome
many of the traps and take advantage of the peculiar opportunities
that honestly are mostly missing from our common experience as adults
but rather than that kind of education we get the other kind that reinforces the representation problem
loss figuration of the lost thing counterfitting of the lost interior asset feelings
experiences of meaningful relation and identity
authenticity
we just get paved over the same way our living places do so that cars can drive on them and
most of those cars have nothing to do with well let's just say they're extremely expensive
to continue supporting
so many of us will arrive at early adulthood or late adulthood
largely deprived of the assets we've brought to our human incarnation
and trapped in a kind of hall of mirrors of representations
and commodities that mimic what was lost or buried or paved over
and some of us will become very concerned about these matters and may become
philosophers or linguists or monastics because we will want to see through the veils
the layers and layers of confusion
that simply being an enlanguaged human being
nearly demands
and we'll be very lucky if we can find anyone at all who understands these matters
in any way that's useful or medicinal medicinal enough to be much help now
not all of us are meant for these paths right these sometimes very academic
or very demanding paths the path of monastic life is extremely demanding
in a sense
and most of us who will enter such paths will begin in a relatively confused state
and so we may pursue paths in life or our development that actually contribute to the problem
at least in the beginning
but it is possible for us to learn and to discover the histories and origins and
natures of these problems and to become gently aware of them right hopefully not obsessively
aware in a way that guides us toward liberation from them
and we have traditions in various cultures surrounding this some of them are religious
some are monastic some philosophical some creative
in many ways i trust the creative ones a bit more because in any
process where there's playful exploration motivated by authentic human concern
there are paths out of the trap that natural the traps that naturally arise there
so
and i might look at all of this trouble that i've been wandering around
and think to myself something like it's not supposed to be this way
and while that might not be entirely untrue it's still quite confused
because it's not entirely clear what way it is or even what it is
or what trustworthy authority we might turn to to understand how it is supposed to be
now the word itself gives us a clue because normal it's a normative word right things
are supposed to be some way or not supposed to be someone when you actually look at the word
it involves a supposition for something to supposed to be some way someone has to
make the supposition themselves that this is the appropriate way for things and beings to be
and who makes the suppositions
who does the supposing what aspects of our mind awareness history habits
become involved when we become very concerned with what things are supposed to be or do
and again there's a normative a normalizing inclination there and i find it quite suspicious
not i wouldn't throw it away entirely i'd just be very cautious about how and where
it rises to authoritative dominance and consciousness and then begins making declarations
assertions
and the idea of supposed to rarely arises unless there's some troubling deviation from our
expectations and normative thought imposes a lot of expectations
unfortunately
i'm going to pause for a moment
and i hope to return to this discussion in just a few minutes
so obviously i have my own purposes and concerns around these matters
and some of them are very local to my own life and mind and others are concerns i have about
other living beings other human beings our societies our cultures our children
our relationships with each other with the strange institutions
that are largely estranged from our nature as human beings and as animals
with the future of the world
but i don't expect to swallow the moon or eat the ocean
i've come to understand what i've been able to learn about these things
because i am deeply concerned
and i'm not merely concerned with injustice
i'm also in love with virtue
not because i'm afraid of punishment but because it feels beautiful to be human
when i'm able to embody and enact virtuous relationships now of course this is already
a problem because if we presume the dichotomy of injustice and virtue now we're stuck
right i can't be virtuous all the time some of my behavior is unjust
and one of the ways this gets embodied in our culture is that the injustices get hidden in the
poor and the environment and children and elderly and sick people and poor people and so on
so
it's going to be really difficult for me if i start out with the polarity
right this is good this is bad this is what i want this is what i don't want and so on
these will produce expectation protocols judgment protocols evaluation protocols
and once those become familiar to me from my habit
they will be largely become invisible
right we have the capacity to learn things
that disappear from our volition as they become embodied
and many of our habits of thought and consideration evaluation concern
particularly about good and bad just and unjust normal and abnormal
these are inclined to be internalized
and that's not meaning it's not to say that it then becomes hopeless it just certainly becomes
more difficult because we will tend to see and feel our way through situations with what is
habitually familiar it has a kind of gravity that draws us back again and again to reenacting
patterns and behaviors that we may actually in our core you know in our essence
in our nature as human beings we may find these miserable and not like them at all
yet we will enact them over and over again once they become familiar
and that traps hard to escape from particularly by oneself
but if we can learn a little bit you know at a time if we can set off on the path of understanding
and open our awareness to these peculiarities of our modern humanity
and if we become curious and if we are passionate and playful
we will discover something very surprising
I might say the prisons I've described are made of doors but these doors are largely
invisible to our familiar approaches our familiar perspectives or angles of concern and interest
yet all throughout our lives
it remains possible for us to begin to set aside familiar habits that lead to traps
and wonder about the nature of all of these things and their historical origins their
cultural origins their non-ordinary origins
the other night I was talking with my son
about similar concerns and he asked a very peculiar question I'm not sure if it's his
question or another's I'm not even sure that it matters much
his question was
in our consciousness why would we place our trust in something so fundamentally insecure
as the mind-like processes familiar to our daily lives
it's a brilliant question it's the kind of question
that could reveal many doors if we take it partly playfully and partly seriously
and rather than answering the question I want to leave it open so that we can pursue it together
in our imagination which is where this is the word we have for
an aspect of our interiority that is both vulnerable to
and capable of liberating itself from
the peculiar predicaments of our minds and intelligences and hearts
with which we try to navigate our thoughts and feelings experiences relationships
and also their absences and also their mimic the mimicry the counterfeits of them
and perhaps by being able to talk about these things together we can begin
we can embark on a path that leads to freedom
for if we are not free in our own minds and interiority the physical freedoms of our daily
lives quickly pale and can even become meaningless patterns of repetitive behavior
in which although our bodies are surviving and we may be being fed and sheltered and we may even
be lucky enough to have relationships they will collapse slowly for some quickly for others
into shell-like constructs that are uninhabitable because their dimensionality
is so impoverished that there's no air there's no oxygen for our hearts there's no oxygen for
our intelligences and the aspects that we might associate with our souls
I'm not sure that liberation is an achievement
many traditions clearly declare that there is nothing to achieve
and that the real trap is
believing in a distinct continuous self and there's some useful perhaps even virtuous
potential there
but even those of us who don't seek will not in this lifetime seek ultimate what we presume
to be ultimate liberation and there is no end of such a path it's an infinite path
even for those of us who are not inclined to pursuits in that direction
we can learn and discover and grow and come to understand the peculiar traps and predicaments
that we often may find ourselves twisted up in
in such a way that we can release our grip
and no longer be compelled to the kinds of intrinsically conflicted ideas and assertions
logics laws rules protocols
that we picked up
as our minds developed in cultures that were mostly opposed to their liberation
and somehow intent upon their capture
and to whatever degree we may make progress together in this matter authentic trustworthy progress
we will be healed we will be nourished and we will discover astonishing depths
to our minds and our humanity and our animal nature our organismal nature our essential
nature our essential nature but are freely available when we are not otherwise
concerned
this is my hope this is my dream this is my prayer today
thank you for joining me I look forward to learning together again
very soon
bye bye for now
