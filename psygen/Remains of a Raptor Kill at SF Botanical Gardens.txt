So, I've come upon a kill site, clearly a raptor has had a meal here.
I'm guessing that these are probably the remains of a pigeon.
There don't appear to be any bones, but it's just an explosion of inner feathers.
You can see some golden ones there, but the larger feathers are what lead me to believe
this might have been a pigeon, though I think others who are more knowledgeable than I may
have another guess.
I just wanted to capture this really astonishing phenomenon here briefly for those of you who
might find it interesting.
I pay attention to where raptors are active and what kinds of things they are doing and
what they are feeding on, and this looks like a really intentional selection of a place
for the raptor to enjoy its kill, and it's just such a startling phenomenon because
yesterday this stump was just bare, and today there are the remains of a meal.
This is near the frog pond in the botanical gardens on top of this old stump.
