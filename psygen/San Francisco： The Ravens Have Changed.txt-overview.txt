The text describes a noticeable change in bird behavior, particularly among crows and ravens, who have become bolder due to decreased human dominance. Birds show little concern for human proximity, engaging in activities such as feeding openly near humans and removing objects from trash without hesitationâ€”behaviors not typically observed during the day. This shift suggests that birds are responding quickly to changes in their environment, possibly sensing a reduction in human presence or influence. The author finds this transformation fascinating and somewhat hopeful, noting unusual bird songs at times when they are not commonly heard.
