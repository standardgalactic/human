So what's up guys, story time with the dog, that's what's up, so since not everyone has
heard this story and since everyone likes to hear it, here you go.
So when I was about like 8, little 8 year old dog, yay, I went on a family beach trip
and the whole point of this trip was to learn how to boogie board and my sister's
know how to do it, my dad knew how to do it and I thought it was really cool to be on
this giant $10 piece of plastic slash styrofoam and ride all those waves back down to the
shore.
I was like oh man, that's so cool, I want to be that guy, I want to show everyone how
cool I am if I run on this big old piece of styrofoam.
So my sister and my dad showed me and then a few hours passed, I practiced, I figured
out it's not that it's not that hard, it's not rocket science but it still took me a
few hours because you know how rocket science is and so my sister goes to eat, I'm still
practicing and then she goes back and I go eat some lunch and I go back and I'm like
oh I gotta find my sister because she knows, she knows what all the good ways are.
She knows what all the good ways are so I need to know where she is.
So I look, I look, I search and search and I see something way out past the boardwalk
and I'm like that must be her, I don't even question it, I'm just like that's her, I know,
I know it's my sister, I'm her brother, we have a bond, we have a connection, I know
that's her.
So I get on my board and I'm like okay paddle, paddle, paddle, paddle, 100's later, nothing,
I didn't get anywhere, I'm eight so obviously I'm not gonna be paddling now, like paddle,
paddle, paddle, paddle, finally start making some distance and I hear something and I'm
like halfway out so either and I'm like oh man, the people are cheering for me because
they know, they know how awesome I'm gonna be, keep paddling 10 more minutes, I'm almost
past the boardwalk I hear either and I'm like damn even God knows I'm gonna be fucking
God like at Boogie Boogie, paddle, paddle, paddle, I'm past the boardwalk and I almost
see, I almost see my sister and I hear either and this time I was like oh shit, even the
fucking devil knows I was born to Boogie Board and then I paddle a little bit more and I
hear it one more time either and I turn around, it's like oh it's my dad, like oh it's my
dad, sweet little e-dog and freaking, he's like what the hell are you doing and whenever
my dad would say he double hockey sticks, it was a big deal so I'm like oh shit it's
about to hit the fan, I mean eight year old talked, aimed and trouble jeepers and I'm
like oh I was just following Robin and she knows all the big waves are and I was like
what the hell are you talking about, she's hanging out on the beach like she's reading
a book and I was like no she's right there, I turned around and point to what I thought
was my sister and it was a duck and it flew away and the moral of the story is one you
don't have sisters, no I'm kidding, real moral of the story is if you have children before
they're at the age of eight and you take them out in public, get their vision checked
because they might make the fatal mistake of paddling out the shore because they thought
their sibling was a duck. Peace.
