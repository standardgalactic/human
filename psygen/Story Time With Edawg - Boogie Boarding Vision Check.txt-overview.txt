The story revolves around an 8-year-old boy on a family beach trip learning to boogie board. His main aim is to impress others by mastering this skill, inspired by his sister and father's proficiency. After several attempts at practicing, he decides to follow what he thinks are signs from his sister indicating the best waves. Mistakenly identifying a duck as his sister, he paddles out far past the safety of the boardwalk.

Upon being called back by his dad, who is alarmed by his actions, the boy explains he was following "his sister" in pursuit of good waves. His dad finds it odd since his sister was actually on the beach. The misadventure concludes with the moral that children might need vision checks before venturing into public spaces to avoid similar mistakes. The story humorously highlights the confusion and boldness of childhood adventures.
