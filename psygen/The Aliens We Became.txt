Hey everybody.
My boat is coming.
I've made a couple of companions here in the gardens, different ones here and there.
And it's interesting to me that we're commonly aware, kind of viscerally, if we have any experience
of what we call pets, that that companionship enriches our humanity. The
companionship with our fish or our snake or our birds or our dogs or our cats and
of course some people have unusual companions. Though I haven't seen it, I'm
not surprised to hear. In fact, I'm modestly pleased and a little concerned
to hear about the deep potentials of human-octopus relations, which is
suddenly, you know, part of the zeitgeist. So most of us, not everyone, have had an
experience of the nature of our humanity transforming and being enriched in relation
with other life forms. And I don't mean by turning them into commodities. That's a
different kind of enrichment. That's the, you know, turn bodies into tokens, into
stacks of tokens in banks, kind of enrichment. I would argue that's defection from actual
relation. So I've made a couple of friends here. There's a pair of blue jays that might
well be, they seem young to me, and they might well be siblings. What do we have here? Looks
probably like an old owl pellet. No conceivably, I'm pretty sure it's an owl pellet. And so
this pair of blue jays has become familiar with me because I bring them, you know, something
that they like. And, you know, they're sort of competitive. They're a little bit competitive,
but one is far more competitive than the other. And hopefully, my audience will forgive me
if I suspect that that one's male. I've seen pairs of siblings in birds often, and I don't
claim to be able to tell their genders explicitly, but there's a motif. And there's a motif among
all the birds. The males tend to engage in certain kinds of behavior. The females tend
to engage in alternate behavior. And there's exceptions, you know, nature's varied. But
those birds, when I'm with them, we extend each other. And one of the things that I think
it's easy to overlook because we may wish to dismiss the biblical trope of humans as
the shepherds of life. And in my view, that's a somewhat confused dismissal because it's,
there's all kinds of ways in which, let us at least say, the influence of our species
is overwhelming. And its impact on all the other living relationships.
So, I don't want us to dismiss the trope. I don't want us to say, well, we're not really
shepherds. Nature is the big thing going on, and we're a phenomenon within that. You know,
we're a child process of that or something. Except that there's a sort of blindingly confused idea
that we're the important thing going on. Ananthropocentrism, excuse me, anthropocentrism. Yeah,
meaning human-centered, but in a weird, sort of broken, egoic way, right? Not in a way that's not
only unhelpful, it's crippling if we adopt such perspectives. We then defect from intimacy,
and interbeing, and centropy with life, all the living beings. But a long time ago,
I was doing Tai Chi, and for a while, you know, over a period of time, this one particular squirrel
would come, and it would stand on its hind legs, white belly, or cute, its arms kind of folded
in front of it, and it would just observe me. Whatever might have been going on there, any kind
of story I make up about it is extremely partial. That's the nature of relation. Our explanations
and our narratives capture, but the tiniest shred of something, and actually, whether they capture
it, they capture and transform it, right? So it's not just usually just capture. In any case,
the squirrel often came, and one day I thought, you know, I'll bring the squirrel something to eat.
And then I realized that that whole scenario, which I did, I brought the squirrel something.
But one way to think about this scenario is that the squirrel contacted on earth, right? A human
being, and was able to relate with the human being in such a way that that human being went in, you
know, in the dimension of humans, which is quite distinct from the dimension of squirrels, even though
they're on the same world, got that human, not got it, but through relation inclined the human
into acting in the human dimension in the squirrel's interest. Now, again, I'm not claiming that's
what happened. I'm saying it's a very useful perspective, because the way that we extend
each other as living beings, all of the organisms, without exception, is part of why we have old
myths and stuff, and strange, new, deceptive, kind of spiritually woo-ish stuff, and rare and
precious people who have reestablished something intrinsically mysterious, which is deep intimate
relation with living places and plants and insects and animals, and the moon time in which those
are over which those relationships become apparent, transform, disappear, right, much like the moon
itself, and how there's not just a story there, there's a re-embodiment of relationships so
ancient and profound that it's extremely difficult to encompass them with any ordinary language,
or at least I find it so, and so if I manage to authentically gain, for example,
an intimate relationship with a specific plant, and in case this is sounding bizarre on the surface,
let's be very clear that anyone who grows plants, they learn about sort of the secret
emotional, soulful, heartful
union that arises, right, between a plant that one loves and cares for, even if it's in a pot,
which I admit is a very strange idea, and one we should think more carefully about in terms of our
lives, because life in a pot isn't necessarily the kind of thing we might want to choose, but
though some pots, you know, it's a very protected environment, it's also a very isolated environment,
how do you, you know, where does your pollen go? My point though is that
the humans who have plants and who grow them with any degree of engagement and awareness
we all discover that there are non-ordinary dimensions in this relationship, we don't have to
make them, I don't have to declare them to be fundamentally mystical, though they have this
connotation for me, they're not merely mechanical, and somehow, perhaps in ways somewhat invisible
to us most of the time, the relationship with the plants transforms us, right, there's new,
there's new space, there's new landscapes for dreaming and insight and healing and understanding
and such, these relationships are deep and they are rich and they're not,
you can make narratives about them,
and some of those could be useful in people capable of implementing them authentically,
or of implementing with a point toward authentically, so my relationship with the plants or beehive
or a specific insect that I come across,
these transform and extend me because they give me, and some people say that's just in your
imagination, I'll be like yeah, so is your comment, they extend my interiority, an aspect of my
interiority into other universes of life, life stranger and more ancient than the sum of human
stories, any one of these organisms is like that, so infinitely deep, a tree of lineages,
a little leaf, you're seeing the leaf, right, when I run into, for example, the parasitic
wasp from New Zealand that I found in the little man-made pond over here one year,
and I rescue it from the pond, and I have no idea what it is, my friend Alexi helped me figure it
out, I cannot recall the name of it, but it's a parasitic wasp that is particular to the Atlas
cedar tree, which turns out to be interesting, these two universes met, right, and there's a
transfer there, I live in the world in a way that can rescue a drowning wasp that would otherwise
have no opportunity to survive, and I can choose to do so, and this is one of the other weird things
about the human side of this thing is, it's almost like, okay, so from one perspective,
I'm going to take humans as a very exceptional species for the sake of this perspective,
there's the earth, right, and all of the living beings on it, and they're all organisms, and
they're all, they become animals and reptiles and so forth, jungles and incredible storms of life in
the ocean, inconceivably diverse and myriad, and then, you know, we don't really know how we got
humans around here, I just want to be really clear about that, there's a lot of mystery there,
I don't doubt evolutionary models, but neither do I take them as
completely conclusive, humans look like a pretty strange anomaly,
in more ways than one, if you, if you just look at nature and then you see humans,
we really like, you know, this stuff, I mean, we really stand out as something strange,
so it's almost as if nature produced this kind of outer space being, right, this weird, dangerous
potentially alienable, right, I think we're pretty much the only creature that can respond to all of
nature with alienation, and this is not modestly important in thinking about how our cultures,
there's a projection here onto life from outer space, right, there's a projection there in that
for example, many of the, you know, abduction experiences that have been reported by people,
which I think are a very complex phenomenon by the way, I'll take that up another time,
involve being treated clinically, right, so that, the only thing on earth I know of
that treats anything clinically is us, and that's weird, so it's almost like
earth gave birth to these weird kind of outer space beings, alienable from nature, yet still
within nature, and we became sort of a new layer, right, in the biocognitive hyperstructure of earth,
or the biorelational hyperstructures, however you want to think about it, I like to think about it
in weird multi-dimensional manifolds that transform over time, but I'm strange that way,
and originally, you know, our people were born in deep syntropy with nature,
intimacy and awareness, such that it was absolutely clear to our ancient ancestors
that each of the plants and the animals is at once its own being, and like a doorway into
relation that extends both, right, that transforms both, participants, so that they,
in a sense, can be understood to acquire what we might can, oh it's not the right word,
it's blatantly obvious with cats and dogs, right, they acquire,
in relation with humans, of course it can go badly, the humans can be cruel or mean or insane
or drug addicted or whatever, or just stupid, and often, you know, I am, well, I mean some of those
things sometimes, the humans can be, you know, it can go really badly for the animals, but when it
goes well, it's pretty amazing, the animal comes to, is transformed by relation with the human,
and comes to exist in the human dimension, right, as if there was just some kind of space travel
here, except it's relational, and, or dimensional travel at least, which is potentially weirder,
think about it, and similarly the human, and again, depending on how the humans in the game,
or how the humans are in the game, can be profoundly extended by a dog or a cat, that relationship
is so deep, right, and all I'm, all I'm trying to say is those kinds of relationships, although a
pet relationship has very unique features, a companion relationship is more open and freer,
right, I don't take the Blue Jays home with me, and I've heard many stories of people, I mean,
there's a woman in my neighborhood, I think her name is Maria, older German woman, who has for many
years had this incredible relationship with the local Raven population, and you can believe she's
extended by that relationship, and they, as well, right, so there is this weird way in which
when we're really deeply in a kind of intimate relationship with living places and living
beings, even for just a few moments, right, even if, even if we just travel to this opportunity,
and become present there for a moment, and show up, the living world is very, very different from
our models of it, it's, there's layers of universes here that our modernity has completely,
have completely, has completely eclipsed, and part of the way it eclipses it is by telling stories
about it, and one might say, well, Darren, you're telling stories about it now, except I'm not,
I'm not trying to tell a story that says what it is, I don't understand it, meaning that my
understanding cannot encompass it, right, in the same way that I don't truly understand water,
or any simple thing, language is very deceptive, we can make noises that refer to stuff, like out
there, and we think, oh, I know what that is, no, no, I mean, in one, you know, in a lexical way,
you know what the symbols correspond to, but that doesn't tell you anything about
the nominatum, the thing the sign points at, right, if I say the moon, it doesn't tell you
anything about the moon, so filling those tokens with content, meaningful content,
is part of the task of a lifetime, and one of the things I'm trying to highlight here is that
if we're missing these layers of relation, that the animal we are is made in, and of, and for,
it won't be likely, we will still be humans, and we'll still have human experience, and so on,
and so forth, but we're missing like 90%, you know, of what's,
this is the kind of tragic impoverishment that I believe we must learn to address together,
we have to remember together, and not according to some creed, what it means to be in deep relation
with living places, and plants, and animals, and insects, and fish, and birds, and you know,
all of the herbs, and all of the food plants, and
their relationships that they have between each other, like we've learned over time, for example,
in agricultural contexts, that certain plants do very well together, and some plants clearly
don't do very well together, relationships, now is there some mystical underpinning there,
well, we could probably find a scientific structure to, you know, to do reductionism with,
and say, for example, will this root bacteria, you know, these roots are symbiotic with these,
this array of bacteria, and these roots are symbiotic with this other array of bacteria,
and these two bacterial constellations conflict fundamentally somehow, right, sure,
that's not the whole truth though, the fact that we can identify a mechanism doesn't mean the process
is mechanistic, it means that reductionism is relatively dependable in a particular lane of
knowledge, right, but that knowledge is, it fails to include the native freedom of
relational dimensionality, meaning, identity, right, you know, we say like if x equals z, x plus
one equals z plus one, the degree of truth is very useful in the incredibly narrow context,
but x has no content, z has no content, I'm just stating an axiom,
so my point was that
we're born for travel in a relational, in layered arrays of relational hyper-systems in nature,
we are, our bodies are made of this, and our minds are made for it, but our ideas
hide this, they inhibit it mostly, and it's weird, we can have ideas, we can inhibit it two
different ways with ideas, right, one is by saying, well that's impossible, that has no part of any
kind of reality I'm familiar with, or will be, and that's a pretty good inhibition, but the other
one which is just as weird in its own way is, oh I know how that works, yeah, right, and here's how
it works, and you know, a long explanation, I mean I can toy with models and stuff and sometimes
that's interesting or useful, but it's, the situation is profusely mysterious, it's mysterious
in maybe a nearly infinite number of ways, right, it'll never be encompassed by
some description, though descriptions can point toward it,
when I develop a relationship with a plant or an insect or an animal, I'm connecting the human
dimension to their entire lineage, all the way back to the beginning of life,
there's a reunion moment, right, between the humans and the parasitic male losp,
or between the humans and the blue jay, or between the humans and the oregano plant,
and it goes both ways, right, I get, I am enriched by the lineage of the being I'm,
I'm in relation with, and that being acquires a friend in the kind of weird outer space of
the human world, and you know, we're the only, one of the weirdest things about us is
we can get things wrong and completely fuck shit up and just factory kill whole universes,
on the other hand, I mean as a species we do this all the time, but on the other hand we're one of
the weird exceptions in nature where, if another animal is injured or in a bad situation, and often
this is because there's humans in the first place, but not always, we can intervene,
it's not weird, but nature produced just one animal with the capacity to complexly intervene
in the suffering of other animals, it's a very peculiar feature for
earth creatures, now it's not that no other creature can protect or help another creature,
they can, but the number of domains and like they can't help them fix a broken wing, right,
and it was really interesting recently when somewhere on the internet I saw noises about
looking for the first signs of intelligence in humans, and one I think bold and actually
intelligent researcher said, you know, what we have here is fairly clear evidence of an assisted
healing in a bone break, you know, many thousands of years ago, right, and that's what she's pointing
out is evidence of intelligence, care, right, the capacity to act to relieve the suffering
of another being or to intentionally enrich
the life and potentials of another being,
now of course all of this kind of thing I'm talking about, we do it between us too,
because each of us is in the human dimension very uniquely, right, so in the same way humans are,
we're very familiar with this game, we just don't, most of us don't really believe we can play that
with nature, like we don't believe there's a tree here that could get me a job, like a good job,
but there probably is, I mean, yeah I guess that sounds superficially ridiculous,
but what I'm trying to say is that the other living beings are in the world in a much more
complex and rich way than we imagine, simply because we don't know, like we probably tried
talking to animals and stuff at some point and trees and things as a child, some of us anyway,
I did, and I was really confused that it didn't work, it took a long time before I realized that
it wasn't the words that do the communicating, it's ones, see this is the really weird thing,
there's no word for this in English that's very good, they're all value laden,
in, like in my torso, there is something very emotional, very deep and resonant and
heartfelt and profound, and it's that thing, that aspect of me that actually
listens to the insect or the plant, and it's blind intellectually, it's blind,
it's not a thinking thing, and also speaks sometimes in images but often just in ache,
right, in resonating awe or wonder or reverence, ecstasy,
reunion, these very deep emotions, and I'm not claiming that I have these emotions all the time,
but when I slow down and I'm present, then the doorway between me and the living world begins
to open a little bit, right, and now these opportunities for deep meaningful relationships
with living places and beings, whether they're momentary or ongoing, they appear, and they often
have non-ordinary, you know, each of the beings is not a person, but they are unique, they're unique,
well I mean it's all kinds of things going on, for one thing they're like the expression of a
tree of lineages, and not just the tree of the lineages of like this is an oak tree, let's trace
it back to the first oak tree and before and the first, you know, life on earth, it's not just,
that's not the only tree that's there, that tree is surrounded by a very complex cloud of symbiotic
relationships, abiotic relationships, right, things to kill, parasitic relationships, right,
all these things, and these words aren't very good, they're just the ones we commonly use,
so yeah, when you touch any living being, the essence of this being, or it touches you,
as sometimes happens when we're available, there's, it's possible to experience something that there
are no reasonable stories about in any of the human literature at all,
the humans have the capacity to join the lineages of life, and this is one of our unique
assets that's easily overlooked in modernity, and we are not given the foundations that we need,
though many of us have natural affinities, right, and so some of us really need help,
there's other people that will say, if I speak this way, like, how do I,
what do I do if I want to make friends with a tree,
and I mean, I tend to give really simplistic advice, right, like,
learn about the tree, spend time with the tree, bring it something good, it might be water,
or you could bring it some dirt, it's not going, the dirt isn't going to, you know,
make the tree, like, bring it a fruit salad or something, it's the
intention of making a gift, right, like, I carry you with me when I'm not with you,
this thing, right, I carry you with me when I'm not with you, you're part of me,
and I bring you this offering that we may become acquainted,
and of course you don't want to, like, force yourself on anything, right, you want to feel
your way into the thing, and spend, you know, just spend time, pay attention,
hopefully it's a tree you have some, you know, curiosity about, some interest in,
some esteem for, right, like, you really like this tree, for some reason it speaks to you in
some way, right, so it's a selective thing, but there's also an overall general thing where,
like, when I'm walking around in this living place right now, partly I'm speaking for the
living place, right, not just for my own agenda, which I mistrust, at least modestly,
because once I start making face noises things get a little strange,
um,
the life around me now is the living moment of vast lineages of life, so when I touch this leaf,
right, with awareness,
there's a reunion, this is part of what is meant by the word communion,
not so much we come together to eat food, but rather
we remember one another from before, I remember you from before, before what,
all the befores, before everything,
you know, when nature sets these little bubbles of life adrift together, but also apart, right,
both and more, each unique one gathers very,
it gathers richness, personal
experience of the universe, of time space, and it's also like the vessel of its entire people
and all their relationships and all of this, right, so it's a really profound thing to encounter
life form at all, if you're out in space and just like, if you just point in a direction and follow
that line, your chances of encountering anything like a complex terrestrial organism,
I can't say exactly what they are, they're actually unknown, but intuitively they seem
profoundly slim to me, so the fact that there's all this life here is actually, this is what
I'm trying to get across, we used to travel in the relational networks and some people still
know this, right, if I went to some specific indigenous tribe and I talked in this way in
their language, I'm sure they would laugh and say, of course, of course, I mean, we never talk about
that because it's just as obvious as oxygen, right, but yes, of course this is so, we live in this
universe of multiply embodied nearby realities that we can transfer to and travel in,
now that's a very exotic experience for any kind of modern human being, it could be profoundly
confusing to them, it's sometimes been confusing to me, in the sense, the majority of humans are
like birds who got really interested in making stairs and worshipping stairs and stopped flying
and just made a lot of staircases, we've lost this essential thing that each of us is born with,
uniquely, and some less and some more and some, you know, in a particular
angle, they have a particular angle on the thing,
on earth unity has precedence, now I think everywhere unity has precedence, all this stuff comes from
well, it's complex to make simple language about it, everything alive though here,
it has, it shares origins and lineages and histories and they traveled all together,
right, so the lines of history for the elm tree and the bee, the honey bee and
the, you know, the clam, right, they were all together in time and the ones that are with us
now are those that survived and managed to propagate and become successful in
the time we live in, until, you know, maybe 100-200 years ago when we started as a species actively,
wiping stuff out,
so in a sense, in nature, we are each other's bodies,
right, our thinking is not much like this,
we are each other's family, fundamentally, in a way that's so overwhelming to directly experience
that we'd probably kind of forget about religion or maybe we'd have very different ones,
and I was just thinking about this and having some experience of it today while I was walking
and I thought, well, I'll wander around the topic for a bit and see if I can get anywhere,
so thank you for joining me for my little experiment and my exercise today
and I wish you every good thing and hope that you may find a door,
if you haven't already, into the living places and the sacred relationships
of all the living beings, yeah, bye-bye for now.
