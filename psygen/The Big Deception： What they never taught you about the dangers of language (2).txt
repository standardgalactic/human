Hey everybody. I'm here in Golden Gate Park. I'm standing next to one of my very
favorite plants that I adore and I had gathered samples of this plant many
years ago because it was clear to me that it it's the kind of plant that would
be useful for me in conducting ceremonies primarily because of its
fragrance and it was many years before I encountered it again by many I mean
many and it took me a long time to discover what you know what the humans
call it and it's an Artemisia it's California sagebrush and this is what
it looks like the the dried stems that you see are the remnants of recent
flowering. Today I'm going to attempt to remake a video that I made yesterday but
I didn't have enough time because I wanted to make the video outside and I
didn't have enough light time to complete it I'll probably go ahead and
post that video but I'm gonna try and make a second one here's another this
number of of these plants around here here's another one
now I'm going to begin by talking about some deceptive features of our
relationships with language and knowledge and I'm gonna talk in different
ways about these deceptive features so that hopefully my listeners can gain
some insight about these problems that underlie some of the most confusing
ignorant and atrocity oriented aspects of our human experience and
particularly our experience of things like news and the relatively abysmal
stupidity of our extended social and political and legal and commercial
cultures. Many of the things that we least enjoy the things that we are most
disturbed by about being human have their origins not as we've been led to
believe in what is usually erroneously referred to as human nature but instead
in our habits our habitual relationships with language categories
concepts and knowledge certainly you can understand that the two plants I made
images of early in the video can be understood to belong to the same species
whether or not they are the same thing depends on how we approach
deriving identity from our experience of phenomenon each instance of a class that
we use language to refer to each instance of a category for example the
category of vegetation or the category of organisms or even the category of
categories each instance of a category is it once or at once resembles the other
instances those plants both resemble California sagebrush and of course there
are sophisticated biological taxonomies so that they are both Artemisia in in
those taxonomies where they both qualify right and yet each of those plants is
distinct and while it may be difficult to quantify the distinctness of each plant
I am inclined to want to say something like to the same degree that humans resemble the
class of humans right that we recognize each human as human to that same degree
that they are alike they are also different and unique but what I will say
instead is that not just instances of a class but the circumstances that we find
some distinguishable entity or thing or situation or behavior the situation that
we find them in when we encounter or relate with them also transforms them
adds uniqueness so that things are not merely what we imagine them to be in
isolation there's a sort of environmental component and there's an
interiority aspect as well as whatever very minute quantities of information our
tokens or models or concepts encode about some organism or place or situation
or behavior phenomenon so on
so at first what I want to make clear is that our relationships with language and
knowledge are deceptive and they're deceptive in a variety of specific ways
that I'd like to outline today and that there is a there are deceptions of
collectivity right so if I if I use the word we if I say well we are trying to
understand the novel coronavirus it's not clear what the we I am referring to is
and yet it seems clear to me when I use this language the language appears to
make sense even though it doesn't really and then there are similar fictions
that arise when we refer to a specific thing like for example the novel
coronavirus and believe that because we can name it it is relatively well
understood this is almost never the case or rather one of the only peculiar
cases in which this is possible is if we are using language to evaluate
language right and part of the reason this is true is that we are formally
representational animals and so we have been endowed by our ancestors and our
cultures with coding systems that go from superclass to category to instance to
qualities right in a descending in what we can imagine as a descending tree like
structure and while we were given this incredible truly incredible ability one
of the things that makes us unique in nature as far as I can tell though
other animals may have some degree of representational capacity they're
probably not formally representational cognitives it's very easy to make errors
of generalization to think for example that because I have acquired some facts
about some or you know some ideas I won't even use the word facts some
perceptions of some phenomenon that I now have captured that phenomenon
completely and know how to generalize my knowledge right how to generalize that
knowledge to all other situations that's impossible that can't be true but
is a common feature of how we deceive ourselves with with language and
knowledge because even if we know about something like a pathogen our knowledge
is unimaginably limited what our words and concepts and models capture about
some phenomenon is vastly shockingly less complete than how we tend to pretend
to ourselves that the language and knowledge that we have is complete and
this is usually an unconscious pretense right it's not that we consciously
decide well now that I know the name of that tree it's a birch I know everything
about it we don't usually consciously decide that this is a kind of hidden
yet implicit feature of our relationship with representational memory
cognition and how we project our habits of projecting very modest the very
modest grasp of our knowledge toward completeness and you can see this
happening all over the place wherever humans are using language and knowledge
and ideas and concepts in public people will pretend because they know the name
of something they know everything about it or they know all that's needed you
know to be known about something this is particularly true in the current
situation where rather than understanding the unimaginable sophistication of the
elements of the situation with with the coronavirus and the socio-political
responses to it many people are parading around on social media pretending
they've got it solved right not possible and it's a perfect example of the kind
of ignorance that has pervaded our species for thousands of years since we
first developed this strange ability to create tokens and systems of tokens that
point at or refer to phenomenon in our experience now I'm going to branch off
briefly here and talk about a couple of related topics in order to recover from
the catastrophic the catastrophically lethal relationships that we have with
language and models and knowledge and by lethal I mean prone to cause very
dangerous kinds of forgetting and also prone to replace relationships with
reference habits now obviously this is not a good idea for human beings like
ourselves that depend upon relationships to understand and develop experience and
express the the noble potentials of our our human incarnation as well as our
social capacities as children we are given or it is more it's more like an
infection actually we are we are infected with the formal representational
habits that have been developed and conserved and have mutated over you know
the over the intervals of human cognitive evolution one of the topics I'm
I'm deeply fascinated by is a topic one might refer to as the evolution of
consciousness right but maybe it would be more appropriate to just call it the
developmental history of the minds we inherit it was a very interesting insect
on my my phone participating with the Congress in the conversation with us it's
a small golden fly that just took off now I just okay I just gave an example of
something right actually what was on my phone if it had 12 billion aspects I
referred to approximately I don't know five of them right and it certainly has
billions of aspects I can imagine well I can imagine for example going to the
doctor and in describing my symptoms and having the doctor tell me yes mr.
Stevenson unfortunately you have symptoms of big bang syndrome and I would
say what and he would say yes yes and actually there's there's no real cure
for it though though we can try palliative treatments but unfortunately
you've been affected by the development of the universe because when you look at
any phenomenon that's what you're actually looking at you're looking at
everything and because we are representational animals in the way that
we have habitually become we have things backwards we start from parts and then
we say things like well everything's connected that's entirely backwards in
terms of what's actually going on what's actually going on is something like
there's a profoundly mysteriously sophisticated unity a
a syntropy right and then we use our minds to make slices in that and and
thus distinguish aspects of the great everything and categorize them and name
them and decide what they're for or how they can be used or turned into
commodities a very dangerous idea by the way what their functions are another
very dangerous idea and whenever we do this as humans we're likely to get some
kind of cognitive or representational grasp on you know between three and or
one actually between one and maybe twelve aspects of identity or form or
relation or qualities right we're gonna get a very small grasp but we'll
pretend that that grasp is complete enough that we could say for example I
know what that is yeah I hear actually I saw a little while ago a phenomenon very
complex phenomenon infinitely complex as all phenomenon are and by the way I I
get the plural and singular of phenomenon phenomenon I get them confused so if
I'm using the wrong one forgive me so yeah I saw something that humans would
generally refer to as a blue j right so what they're gonna do is they're gonna
go and this is all unconscious and happens quite habitually right we go
from everything to something to an animal to a bird to a specific type of
bird to that bird I'm looking at to blue j and most of the time then we're done
and having thus traversed that little tree right we convince ourselves that
we understand the phenomenon now in a way for a specific purpose that might be
relatively true let's say the purpose was and this may be how we got trapped
this way let's say the purpose originally a long long time ago was
relatively simple it was to determine whether a novel experienced phenomenon
comprised a threat because if it didn't you could go back to grazing or social
hierarchy maintenance or mating or fighting or whatever the heck it was
you were doing a minute ago and for the purposes of determining whether or not
something is a threat some of this behavior is modestly
efficacious it works right once I've determined that the noise I heard behind
me was only a blue jay I can go back to doing whatever else I wanted to do
however that set of habits is entirely insufficient to determine whether it was
an opportunity yeah for threat detection not horrible not great either but for
opportunity detection much worse because although the presence of a blue jay
might be easy to dismiss as a possible threat it's not easy to determine if by
following or paying attention to that blue jay I could learn something no one
else has ever known that would comprise an astonishing opportunity and by the
way that's something that actually happens to me right I I pay attention to
signals in nature that other that if I were just doing threat detection I'd
never pay any attention to them right I'm but I'm curious so I'm looking for
opportunities to learn and to understand and to expand my understanding and to
leave the trap of the known and knowledge and to experience the benefits that come
from transforming my relationships or even inhibiting my relationships with
classes categories instances and naming yeah so in childhood we are given or as
I said earlier we are infected with the representational habits of our ancestors
and normally if you gave some if you gave a child something incredibly
dangerous you'd also teach them about its dangers the same thing would be true
if you gave your friend something that was unfamiliar to them but familiar to
you and had both powers and dangers something like for example a knife and
there there is in in human beings there's a a semantic or linguistic or
cognitive analog of a knife and it's incredibly dangerous to use this thing
and we use it all the time in ways that often make us dumber every time we touch
it and as if that weren't bad enough the knife gets used by things that aren't
even human like corporations or governments or other non-human collective entities this
knife gets used in all kinds of ways that again are lethal contagious deadly invent
new threats where previously there were none obliterate opportunities that might
otherwise have existed this knife the knife we use to make cuts in the manifold
of identity in order to understand what we usually mean is overstand by the way
the phenomenon and the relationships and threats and opportunities around us
that knife is horribly broken and our relationships with it are catastrophically
misfounded and they have been for thousands of years and while we've been able to build
every imaginable device and technology that we could think of we've completely failed to
solve the central problem infecting the fundamental nature of our humanity and our
social and relational systems so you know yeah I'm holding in my hand a smartphone
that represents probably more computing technology than existed on earth in 1970
but and that seems astonishing and yet we've been we've been devolving we've
been falling down a mountainside backwards in terms of developing the most
fundamental of technologies all of which are cognitive and relational and we must imagine
that some of our ancestors were a lot better at this than we are and the fact that we were able
to overcome them with guns and cannons and ships and horses and armor and stuff doesn't mean we
were smarter it just means we had different equipment right and this is a problem in the
evolution of human consciousness and it's a very sophisticated problem that I probably won't have
time to sketch in detail yet I think just by suggesting it you'll be able to understand what
I'm pointing at and hopefully if we can become conscious of these issues together that will
give us the initial thrust so to speak the initial momentum that we need to achieve something
analogous to escape velocity from the gravity of the history of these diseases that we think of
as benefits right the reason the adults don't warn the children as they're in
culturing them and in languaging them there's a number of reasons for this the first is
nearly none of the adults are actually aware that language is dangerous they think instead
um their children are receiving an unimaginable gift right the gift of being able to communicate
verbally and think conceptually and model uh by the way that that modeling is presented as
as usefully predictive right in other words it will help them avoid setting themselves up
for catastrophes in the future and will also help prime them to take advantage of opportunities in
the future well while that's not entirely untrue that's less than a 50th of the story right what
actually happens is that our broken relationships with language and knowledge set us up for traps
that without those broken relationships would never exist and rob us of unimaginably sophisticated
opportunities for intelligent thought and relation discovery development benefits um of myriad kinds
right so most of the adults aren't aware that what they're going to do to their children
is analogous is is cognitively and relationally analogous to the bizarre
um socio-religious habits of genital mutilation we're going to take the mind of the child
a mind capable of acquiring unimaginably sophisticated different forms of intelligences
both from humans and from nature and from places we don't even have categories about that are proper
we're going to take this organ of interested connectivity and we're gonna we're going to
dismember it okay until it most it would be like taking both your hands and removing all
their parts except maybe the index finger and then saying well done good job right now you're
ready to participate in human culture and then we wonder why you know um people have all kinds of
different psycho-emotional responses to this this very highly celebrated process of of mutilation
that parents imagine to be uh a success worth celebrating right finally little josie said two
words they don't realize that little josie is undergoing a catastrophic transformation of the
organs of intelligence with which she can acquire new forms and behaviors related to her possible
intelligences and that something's being lost right something's being sacrificed to get to
that place where she can finally put two words together so part of the reason that the adults don't
warn us right they they're gonna they're gonna give us something incredibly dangerous but they
don't know it's dangerous they don't realize it's dangerous and they don't know how it's dangerous
most of them and so they're incapable of preparing us to relate with our formally
representational cognitive history safely and intelligently now by safely i don't mean perfectly
safely there's no such thing as that i mean more safely than we do right now there are a variety
of disciplines in which one can learn uh about topics that relate to this so that in truth there
are very very few people who have any understanding about what i'm talking about though nearly everyone
i think has some degree of unconscious awareness right in other words they're aware that something's
wrong but they can't they can't put it into language and that's not too surprising because
if the thing you use to make language with is the problem you're trying to make language about
you're likely to have trouble yeah and this is part of the predicament we're in but people who
study semantics um people who study linguistics and to some degree uh poets and storytellers
eventually become aware of topics that that orbit my concern here today and there's one
very exotic very sophisticated branch of knowledge essentially established by a single
but a single brilliant mathematician who is also partly mad in my perspective
that i'm going to introduce here because it's relevant and i've studied this to some degree
and what i'm going to introduce is the topic of a discipline called general semantics
and this is the brainchild interesting word there of a man named Alfred Korzybski
who wrote about this in related topics i believe in the 40s and 50s but possibly as early as the 30s
and possibly as late no i think i think the 50s is probably about as late as he wrote um
um Alfred Korzybski i think that's spelled k o r z y b y s k i i believe that's the spelling
of this last name he's the inventor of general semantics and uh what might be referred to as null
a or non-aristatelian logic and his system is very complicated um it's not too difficult to distil
some of the most important features down to easily transmissible understandings and practices
and a friend of mine very close friend Nathan Benema that's a b i n n e m a is currently offering
some courses that can introduce people to key features of this discipline and you can find
him on facebook if you wish and uh sign up for his um for his uh his course work and his lectures
and he's someone whose knowledge of general semantics i trust um this is a very exotic topic
but i'm going to introduce a few features of it one of the things that alfred Korzybski recommends
and there are a number of them is that we become conscious that we are abstracting when we are
thinking or using language to talk about things and this is really important this is actually
what i'm trying one of the key things i'm hoping to communicate today is that we if we become
consciously aware that we are we're using a relatively unsophisticated array of overlays
and habits to refer to both distinguish recognize and refer to phenomenon in our experience
once we recognize the primitivity of those habits and features we will have gone a long way to
resolving some of the problems that we are otherwise unimaginably vulnerable to
and these are problems that obliterate human societies and cause humans to have
an unsurvivably toxic relationship not merely with nature but with their own cognition with
each other um so if we could make any progress here at all that would be unimaginably beneficial
right we could acquire immunity uh to an encyclopedic catalog of errors we consistently make
now when i talk about consciousness of abstracting i'm going to give an example so
um that thing there
uh that phenomenon right actually is a localization of everything so it has no limit
in other words if we were to try to catalog all of its associations and qualities
that catalog would necessarily be infinite it has no end so let's imagine that there's
that there's i don't know 10 000 possible qualities and relationships of that thing i just pointed at
that are accessible to me at all right the rest of them are so exotic or as yet unimagined
as yet unrepresented in language or thought or modeling or concepts that they're unreachable to
me yeah so when i when i point out that thing and begin to distinguish it with my mind i'm going
to be making cuts in the manifold of everything and i'm going to be making cuts that are physical
right i'm going to say that thing is distinct from everything else around it but i'm also going to
be making cuts that are temporal right i'm pointing at that thing right now but we could
reasonably expect that it was there yesterday and may very likely be there tomorrow and it has
you know a historical lineage of ancestors and it may have um progeny in the future and so on
and so forth right so i'm i'm making cuts in categories i'm making cuts in the environment
i'm making cuts in space i'm making cuts in time i'm making cuts in form and i'm
i'm going to use the commonly recognized word to refer to that tree so what tree actually gets a
hold of is some incredibly tiny subset of the 10 million or 10 000 things as a you know modern
human being i'd have a shot at um deriving right i'd have a shot at deriving them and
most of the of the actual phenomenon is left out and that's how representation works right
representation can't contain or refer to the entirety of even the simplest phenomenon again
some exceptions exist in the ironic domain of language right we can use language to talk about
language in ways that approach modestly relative completeness but if we refer to anything any kind
of phenomenon even in the mind or in the world our attempts to encompass it with tokens or signs
or models are necessarily wildly incomplete and when we become aware of this fact when we become
aware of the fact that first of all that phenomenon is not a tree that phenomenon is unknowable
and it connects to all other unknowable phenomenon doesn't mean we can't learn anything about them
it means that the token tree has nothing to do with that phenomenon the token is a game that
english speakers play right it's a coding game that allows us to use little coded tokens to refer
to phenomenon that are in and of themselves unknowable being aware of that is one way of
thinking about being conscious that we're abstracting now what's ironic is that in talking about being
conscious of abstracting i'm still abstracting because i'm using language to refer to this process
i call abstracting and just like the tree the language only gets a very modest grip on whatever
abstracting might be and that's the nature of language and knowledge in general it's always
wildly incomplete and yet we are prone habitually to get that backwards and to think if i know what
kind of tree that is by the way it it appears to be the kind of tree humans refer to as a eucalyptus
um then i know what that is i know what that phenomenon is untrue wildly untrue will forever
be untrue and just understanding that one thing right that the toys we use to refer to phenomenon
and to make ideas about them and to speak of them and to model them and to um consider their nature
or form or relationships or behaviors or activities are catastrophically incomplete
no one will ever completely catalog all of the things all of the behaviors of any organism
it's impossible and again part of the reason for that is that there are no separate organisms
organisms are expressly coupled to everything and this is part of the problem we have with
knowledge in general right with science and physics we keep trying to decouple specific
phenomenon from the background stuff right the stuff they're related to so that we can study
them distinctly well it's not that that's not useful but the kind of knowledge that results
from that however functionally useful it may be is both incomplete and deceptive because
if you take an octopus out of the ocean it's not really an octopus anymore like yes the creature
still qualifies for the class but the octopus in the ocean go together the same way that like you
and oxygen go together right if i take you out of oxygen you still qualify for the form human being
but you're dead so you're not you know are you still human well by some lights
and these are the kinds of confusions that swarm that they're seething inside our relationships
with language and knowledge all day every day every moment of every day that we've never really
examined uh there are other features of general semantics that i'm not well prepared to present
but there are two there's a couple of topics that i want to introduce and one of them is the
difference between what i'll call the public and the private right and the first way i'll talk about
this is a very human way where we all know that we have something we could refer to as a public
face and one of the words we use to refer to this is our reputation but it's not just our
reputation that is our public face we may have credentials we may have jobs or relationships
or vocations we may have things we've created or done with other people that are known publicly
we have a public presentation face on the outside but then inside us we have
this inward facingness right we have a private face and it gets more sophisticated than that
we have sort of simulations facing us of people outside us who might evaluate judge select
not select promote demote us yeah so there are there might be actual people in our lives who
have roles like that or who we've experienced and also there might there might be people who will
validate or devalidate us who will authorize or deauthorize us in various ways so we have two
two aspects of this one is our actual experience of this in our human lives but the other
is the experience of it in our interiority where we simulate in a sense or we imagine
critics and authorities and judges and evaluators and so on and so forth and our relationship
with society imbues us with these habits and this is another thing that honestly we need training
we need help here because this stuff is super dangerous two of the things that underlie the
nature of human identity and self-awareness relate very strongly to our relationship with
authorities and authorization right who are the authorities that have impact on our lives
and whose proclamations do we authorize as being trustworthy true good beneficial
safe harmful wrong and you know we can authorize and deauthorize so inside us there's this very
sophisticated constellation of aspects yeah there's the outward facing social face there's the
inward facing private face and then there's the actual circle of authorities and evaluators and
judges and critics and so on and then there's the imaginal inward facing one and in case you're
not aware of this much of what we refer to as mental illness is a result of that thing i just
talked about the experience of extrinsic authorities judges critics evaluators and so on and the way
that we each uniquely develop an interiority around that right an interior reflection of that
so i want i want everyone to just become conscious of that i can't yet explain
it's it's too sophisticated for me to explain what i'd like us to do with that just yet
and there's some other topics i want to get to before i run out of time at the moment
so there's another common fiction of language that involves generalizing right and there's a
couple of different ones that i'm particularly concerned with one of them is a rhetorical fallacy
that i think i invented but maybe someone else has called it out as well
um i call it the congregantes pacemi fallacy and there's an inversion of that fallacy too but
the congregantes pacemi fallacy is a fallacy where someone cherry picks some particularly negligent
or miserable or cruel or terrible behavior in some relatively modest segment of the population
right not everybody just some group um you know like let's say at a grocery store they see some
woman fighting physically with another woman over a bottle of water right and then they come home and
write about this on social media and they say what's wrong with people they generalize this
this observable you know negligent behavior not merely to all people right they presume that humans
are just blocked right but also over all time right they're not aware of the fact that situations
have limits temporally right they begin and they they occur and they end right so the congregant
the congregantes pacemi fallacy is the fallacy that some observed behavior
gives you an idea of the character of all possible instances of whatever is producing
that behavior like human beings or tells you something for example about human nature right
when in fact what's really going on is something far more sophisticated and complex and yes
there are certainly examples of people who behave in ways that are extremely unintelligent or cruel
or vicious or terrible but that doesn't mean that it's human nature to do so
and i'm going to get to why in a moment so there are many fallacies of generalization
of clumsy generalization that we're prone to because we were never trained to do something else
instead and we weren't no one revealed these dangers to us and not only did no one reveal
any these dangers to us we're subjected to them constantly the media takes absolute advantage
of the fact that we tend to get dumber every time we use language because they can then produce
outrage or terror or and and by the way when when when media and information becomes a weapon
whole populations can be enslaved right they can be just turned into a shadow
so there's a lot of money to be made in ensuring that every time people touch electronic devices
or use language they get dumber and that's most of what's going on
under the rubric of educating us and that's not too dissimilar to what happens in childhood
right what they actually call education is a catastrophic nightmare of misapplied language
because if we were truly educated we would first be educated about the dangers and opportunities
inherent in the kinds of minds our animal homo sapiens is capable of forming
so that we could form useful intelligent beneficial relationships with language and knowledge
rather than the catastrophically crippling relationships that obtain when
when something else is done
so so now i want to talk a little bit briefly before i close here about the difference between
classes and instances so you can say for example and i think this is also a rhetorical fallacy
most people blah blah blah you know most people are greedy right but you can't produce most people
and then go examining them and even if you did the idea that most people are greedy supposes a
context that wasn't introduced you're you're we're taking people out of contexts the actual
contexts in which they're enmeshed and we're we're supposing that these people
exhibit a quality the quality of greed natively that it's just natural for them to exhibit the
quality of greed the same way it's natural for them to breathe oxygen it's entirely untrue
it's just it not only is it not true it it can't be true and the reason it can't be true
is that there are no there's no such thing as decontexted people and again here we see
consciousness of abstraction right because i'm conscious that i'm using abstractions to speak
about uh things i'm going to refer to with language like human beings because i'm conscious
of the limitations of that i am aware that understanding any phenomenon requires that
we not remove it we don't decouple it from context and that's part of what happened when the woman
complained on facebook that she saw some malignant behavior down at the store during a time when
everybody's terrified and confused stress levels are high um there might not be water in the future
right uh not to mention that each person has a unique personal history that inclines them to
various kinds of vulnerabilities emotionally psychologically behaviorally relationally financially
and so on right there's all this contexting information that gets thrown out when we say
well most people are greedy it's just not true right what most people first of all can't be
produced you can't produce most people and then go examining them for greed secondly if you did that
the context is greed testing and if you go greed testing people that's going to change what people
are because you've changed the context therefore you've changed the participants in the context
and this is part of the problem with how we use language in general and how unaware we are of
the incredibly primitive catastrophically clumsy applications of language we've been trained to
employ right it's not that you know here if you listen carefully one of the one of the songs you're
going to hear in the background of my my speaking today is language and knowledge are bad boy those
things are dangerous it's true they're really dangerous if your relationship with them is broken
right well we'll never get rid of language and knowledge you know we have probably the same
problem with technology technology is really dangerous for human beings to have these smartphones
that we use that i'm using now to record on this is an incredibly dangerous thing
it actually damages my mind to use it but we're not going to get rid of them so similarly with
language and knowledge i'm not saying language and knowledge are bad i'm saying they're incredibly
dangerous and they're the they're a primordial technology that we must together correct and
improve and develop intelligent relationships with so that we understand the dangers can be
conscious of those dangers and can help each other to learn and grow minds that are worthy
of our human incarnation and the astonishingly beautiful and profuse potentials for intelligence
and awareness and discovery and curiosity and wonder and reverence and joy and play
that are that are natural to our our human experience but that so many of us are deprived
of by specifically these problems so firstly when we talk about a phenomenon we need to recognize
any situation in which either an unjustified generalization is being made most people are
blah blah blah right and secondly where some phenomenon is being decontexted if i say most
people blah blah there's no context but actual human beings always exist in a context right now
i'm in the context of making this video yeah so and i'm in i'm in this you know this living
context around me i'm in a relatively natural context within a city within my life right
there's all this contextualizing environmental input yeah and all of that transforms me my
identity my role my potentials my felt sense of role context transforms roles this is really
important to understand about humans humans derive their felt sense of role from their
understanding and experience and emotional felt senses of context and if the context is toxic
or lethal meaning it makes you forget stuff or kills you or is garbage it's just really clumsy
and crude then humans tend to derive really crappy roles from that because they're like fish in water
right you poison the water the fish are poisoned and context is like role it's like the role slash
relational water of humans so this is another thing that's very useful to bear in mind if you're
trying to understand anything about the behavior of individual humans or groups of humans because
both of them are extremely sensitive to context now i want to talk briefly about the difference between
something general and something specific
so for example if
if i refer to humans i'm talking about a class of organisms but every human within that class
is very unique and each individual human will have experience of something like a day
like today's saturday right everybody around me will be having an experience of today
so it's true they're all having experience i mean if they're conscious and even if they're asleep
they're probably they're having some kind of something like experience but each one of them
is going to be really unique even if there's somebody walking right next to me right and
we're in the same context even if that person was born on my birthday right even if that person
lived in every city i lived in when i lived in that city we are going to be extremely unique
and so this is one of the features that gets glossed over by language so that for example
people think they make face noises about the novel coronavirus which is a very puzzling
phenomenon with trillions of different features right you'll never get a grasp of
you'll never get anywhere near a complete grasp of something we can point at because
again the novel coronavirus is part of the entire life history the entire history of life on earth
it has trillions of qualities and infinite qualities so when we start talking about this we
can get a grasp on a few of those but that doesn't mean it's safe to generalize about it right let's
say that for example country a is relatively lax about enforcing social distancing and business
closure and stay at home orders and so on and doesn't get immediately obliterated right so that
doesn't mean that country b doing the same thing as country a will experience the same outcomes
and the reason is that the number of variables involved are unimaginable they're literally
impossible to imagine so there's there's people running around on like social media pretending
that they've got a grasp on this phenomenon they know what's going on there's no chance of that
right the phenomenon is so unimaginably sophisticated there's there's variances according to
um location on earth there's variances according to the genetic predispositions of populations
there's variances according to blood type age set gender um there's variances according to
things we can't know of because we don't even have categories for them yet like human knowledge
however apparently advanced it may seem is actually unimaginably primitive we've got very
modest grasp on tiny little pieces of reality that we managed to kind of cordon off so that we
could um obtain information we could validate as reliable and right now in the situation
we're presently facing there are so many unknowns that nobody knows what's going on if one of your
friends is telling you here's what's going on i'll tell you the truth they're out of their mind
right that person probably needs help um and i mean that compassionately uh there's nobody who
knows what's going on in fact what is a vast unimaginable constellation of things that at
best we're going to get a very modest grasp on little tiny pieces of as the situation evolves
and even when i say the situation that's an unjustified generalization what situation
there's thousands of million endless infinities of situations so how am i going to grasp on that
you think if i say well it's a conspiracy yeah there's a conspiracy all right i mean there's a
conspiracy to make humans dumber every time they use language it's been going on for thousands of
years if you're really concerned about conspiracy you might want to look at that one because if you
don't solve that your capacity to detect conspiracy will be zero right like the thing you detect
conspiracies with is fundamentally broken so if you if you aren't fixing that then i'd love to see
what it is you're going to fix um and how you're gonna go about it so we really need to be to learn
together how to pay attention to both the dangers and the possibilities of our status as formally
representational cognitive animals and that's part of what i'm inviting us to do today and i'm trying
to give us a little bit of uh a little bit of an ignition force right a little bit of thrust a
little bit of momentum in that direction and those of you who find this interesting and important
are welcome to learn together with me because i'm i'm still learning these things i'm
it's not as though i've mastered them i'm aware of them and they fascinate me and i'm concerned about
them and so we can all learn together and and we're going to have to teach each other we're
going to have to lift each other up out of the you know 12 000 year muck of human representational
confusion so that we can interact intelligently with the faculties and capacities that are possible
to us due to this strange situation that there's an animal on earth that's a formally representational
cognitive animal us homo sapiens um before i go i'm just going to highlight something in case it
wasn't clear it's very important to understand that there's a unimaginable gulf of distinction
between a class of phenomenon for example um the class of organisms and a specific instance
of a phenomenon for example a skunk right in in a context in a place and that one of the problems
we have is we're prone to making generalizations and thinking that they're universal that they apply
to all instances they don't there are things there are because one of the reasons we got confused
about this is you can say general you can make generalizations about certain things about skunks
that will apply to most instances of skunks right for example they are generally a four-footed animal
right they have a musk gland they're black and have a white stripe you know there's things you
can say that generalize to all instances but it's crucially important to remember and one of the
things that's going on now is that we're being this is being demonstrated that a specific instance
or place or person is an extremely unique thing however much they may resemble the generalities
they're going to have a vast unimaginable array of unique features that cannot be captured by models
or forms or generalizations yeah so recognize the primacy of locality and specificity of the
uniqueness of individual organisms situations circumstances statistics can't do anything around
that right statistics are about groups and that's why they don't apply to individuals yeah um they
they can be used to refer to individuals as members of groups but if you take the individual and
if you take the individual by themselves
the purchase of statistics on the individual is extremely minimal or maybe even non-existent
and the reason is that an instance of one does not comprise a group
and statistics are about groups they're also about generalizations of groups
so they will not apply evenly to every subset or every population that you examine
thank you so much for joining me I hope I was able to cover
usefully some of the content that it was my my goal to cover and I wish you all
and those you love health and well-being bye bye for now
