[Music]

I don't want to set the

world on

fire I just want to

start a flame in your heart

so you just asked me if I had any

thoughts about Jack

sarati and

um you know we were prior to that we

were speaking about incredibly brilliant

women like Sarah James the dream

incubator um or you know the onira

font I love that word or

onom um am Maria Maru the Greek

mov Joanna Joanna

Kwa okay there's some noise do we just

go into deep

space hello

fello probably that person just muted

their

mic

Y and that's probably um

Nathan give me just a

second we'll actually do the

uh the introit

so let us take a

moment

together to remember all of those beings

who have

[Music]

striven to establish a

beautiful way of being on our world and

on all

worlds um those men and women and

children and elders and animals and

living places

brilliant of

spirit and gentle of

heart and also

Fierce who strove throughout their

lives to amend fun fundamental

problems on our world which are

primarily it appears with

humans they arise in our

species so somehow at the same time as

having the capacity City to establish

something paradisical here our species

seems fascinated with the possibility of

hell as

well and I want to remember all of those

beings past present and future who

strove

to become living medicine for the

problems that our

species so

trenchantly

recapitulates generation after

generation and We Gather in the hope of

sustaining their vision and dream and

establishing amazing and beautiful and

intelligent ways to be human

together remembering them inspires

us and may we serve their their dreams

and

passions with the same Brilliance and

heartful awareness that they brought to

their existence and their struggles

oh beautiful ones we remember

you so um you know we were talking about

brilliant women I named a

few uh I'm particularly amazed at this

point by Sarah James's work

um she has studied dreaming her entire

life one of the things she said that

that I think is really brilliant is that

she felt that if she could just sustain

Lucidity this is really important to me

because I've had a similar kind of

concern uh when she was very little she

was lucidly dreaming all the time just

naturally and she's not the only person

like this a number of the people that

have spoken with her are

similar and as a little girl this is

this I think is hilarious and brilliant

as a little girl she thought if I can

just sustain that

Lucidity across the barrier into

waking I will defeat death I will live

forever now I think that's amazing for a

number of reasons the first is what did

children know of death

anyway I mean they they don't I I almost

died once when I was a little kid and I

was just curious

I wasn't

scared you know I realized like I'm

going to die right now and I was like oh

okay a nothing I can do I'm G to sure

miss

mommy there wasn't any like Terror or

anything I'm like I just fell down on

the ground unconscious and you know

started dying um guess it's it's kind of

cool that I didn't have to actually die

at five years

old uh I was suffocating I couldn't

breathe my lungs were locked up

my mom woke up when she heard the thump

of my body on the floor she was napping

on the couch

nearby managed to make it out to the

living room before I passed out she got

me breathing

again but uh yeah so Sarah thought if I

just learn to stay Lucid all the time

then I I will never die which is such a

brilliant thought for a child to have

um only that I

mean how uh oppositional to everything

the adults are doing which is almost

always the opposite of

Lucidity right the waking world of human

beings is the catastrophic opposite of

dream

Lucidity um for most of us much of the

time now there are exceptions you know

when we're being really

loving uh or we're we're trying to grow

together or even in our you know in our

meetings um we we at least Verge on

Lucidity because we s of have this

agreement right we start out with an

agreement to try to see and remember and

learn um and even like the things that I

said in the beginning of the

meeting man I really mean those things

those are not mere words to

me um my heart desperately needs a

context in which to chase its origin and

the beauty of the possibility of our

existence with other you know people

like myself in that in those

senses

um and you know I've studied dreaming in

my own way my entire life I I know a lot

of unique things about dreaming that I

think are very

uncommon even in my interview with

Sarah my first one and I hope to do

another

soon um she was startled by one of my

question which is what do you think the

source of Illumination in dreaming is

this never occurred to

her so I feel I feel kind of uh excited

that I was able to ask a question that

she had never yet considered about

dreaming um but I could ask her a lot of

questions because I I'm a weird I'm a

weird

mind

[Music]

um but yeah she's she's really brilliant

and the thing about Lucidity is that it

it unifies the normally

distinct aspects of

awareness and one of the things that I

always

wondered was you know all the the

dreaming experts are talking about lucid

dreaming but no I I haven't heard one of

them talk about lucid

waking apparently this idea never

occurred to

them but it seems to have occurred to

Sarah

right because from even as a little kid

she thought apparently she thought that

if she could retain the

Lucidity um that she normally experience

she commonly experienced in

dreaming

uh into her waking experience that she

would be free from Death that's a really

trippy

idea um now of course it's not actually

clear that death it's not clear that

death

exists really

isn't um

we um the the death of our body

exists that that's real that's that's

going to happen in so much as uh you

know this is what we mean by

death but the death of the self is

wildly unlikely in my

view um there's no there's there's

almost no evidence for it other than you

know the person disappears from our

experience which seems like a lot of

evidence but

isn't

um so the death of the body that's real

for sure but the death of the of the

being that

um uh what is the right word that

animates right the being that animates

the

body

um very much doubt this myself there's

so

much Clear evidence in my view for that

not being

real um and rather uh rather than being

destroyed or ceasing to

exist um what happens is a transition

into a different

layer uh yeah I think but yeah it's just

brilliant that she thought if I can just

remain Lucid I will defeat death that's

awesome what a brilliant

idea um and then of course you know we

find all of these uh traditions

and this is going to get to something

that George was saying in a

recent text

message find all of these Traditions

that

associate something very similar to

death with healing healing impossible

things there's a story of course it's

anecdotal

um and uh

that during

um uh the the mysteries of alfis right

where they

would take thousands of people from all

walks of

life um through an

initiation first they would have to

purge themselves right so it would be

six

months I think of

abstention from

sex well it's not hard for me can

abstain from that

forever um eating meat right uh fasting

not abstaining from fasting but

fasting

um Coldwater ba bathing uh a lot of sort

of hardship six months of prep and then

you carry a piglet with you you get a

piglet you Traverse this long path over

a number of

days um together with the other

initiates and then you go through this

process which is what you know

Hilman I don't think he actually

understands the process um but he does

know that there was a way to experience

death and

rebirth even though I don't know what he

thinks about it this is one of the

things I hope to ask him about if I get

a chance to talk to him

again um

and he thinks you know this was a thing

done with intoxicants or that the Medusa

Medusa were were involved the medus I

don't know how to pronounce that AE at

the end means plural pluralizes the

Medusa but

um it's clear that there there probably

were substances involved um there's a

record of a man who'd been I think he'd

been blind his entire life and he went

through this and came out with the

ability to

see it's clear that um not everyone like

right you had to be selected to be

healed but you had a shot at it right

even if it was you know impossibly

impossible to heal injury or something

you had a

shot and

um you know this is a

this is a thing where you meet the the

Divine beings so essentially you're

going to travel from this world to the

or what I call what I refer to as the

origin world and that origin World which

most of us have no conscious experience

of I have experienced

it um or I claim to have you know if

people want to question me about

it uh I have to say that compared to

that the realness of this world is

trivial it's not real at

all um the origin world

is this impossible thing you can be in

Both Worlds at

once you can be in the origin world and

incarnate here at the same time I

wouldn't be surprised if babies have

this experience and then forget it as

they become enculturated and languaged I

think they probably do have this

experience

um I don't know what their experience

during conception is I think they do

have experience during conception it's

unclear how that or if that's

remembered um but yeah there's some kind

of a strange

Amnesia that afflicts

Us in

um in the process of incarnating right

not just you know by force of

incarnation but the process we undergo

which is a process

of anol Lucidity right like the loss of

Lucidity and if we had Lucidity then I

think it would be impossible not to

sense the origin world because the thing

that you call your mind is actually the

spark of that world in the Incarnate

World um so that means

that it's as if there's a kind of

lightning that's touching you all the

time and if that lightning of the origin

world were to go away you would perish

immediately You' certainly not be able

to have awareness in my view I realize

this all sounds theoretical but I'm

going somewhere with this

so the ancient Greeks in other cultures

certainly the Egyptians and others

before them though Hilman would like us

to believe this all starts with the

Greeks or the pel

pel I can't remember

P I can't remember

pagans yeah something like this the the

sort of the preg Greek

peoples but no it starts way back and

other cultures have known about these

things but in the

Greeks the mystery Traditions literally

take you down under the

Earth um you kill the piglet to

symbolize before you begin you kill the

piglet to symbolize the death of the

sovereignty of your

human animal desires over the desires of

your spirit so your soul or origin what

I call origin so the the idea is that is

sort of to flip

over so that no longer you can no longer

be enslaved by the desires or the fears

of your

body the um the slaughter of these

piglets poor little piglets is not

merely symbolic but it's also symbolic

of putting to death um the stuff that

keeps you

trapped uh that causes the

Amnesia which is mostly your human fears

and your desires for sensory Pleasures

right and there's a really good reason

why you'd want to put those

away and the reason is that

if you could even for a

moment experience your Soul's

senses you would never give a [ __ ] about

any kind of pleasure you could ever have

in the flesh you would not care like sex

I don't give a [ __ ] food don't need that

water who cares sunlight doesn't matter

um there are Pleasures so profoundly

ecstatically beyond anything you can

imagine that the pleasures that you that

we seek the Comforts that we seek in our

incarnate aspect are TR just you could

just forget about them they have they

have no meaning in the face of even a

few moments of this

Lucidity of understanding what you are

and where you come from and who your

actual family is and what your role in

that family is and all of these

things um so George was saying last

night I'm I'm GNA ask him to sort of

step in here and and take over for for a

time because I've been blathering long

enough um I'll just I'll just finish up

with a couple things so post

initiation the successful initiates have

essentially died to they've experienced

death while they're alive this is what

is referred to as the second birth that

we sometimes hear about in religious

Traditions particularly Christianity

although Christianity steals this idea

and reformulates

it as something that you C can only

happen if you you know worship Jesus

which I think it's absurd I doubt Jesus

even wanted to be worshiped if Jesus

existed I don't think he was like

worship me and be free I don't think

that's what he was talking about at all

most likely what happened is that the

tenants of the mysteries of

alfis were

misconstrued by a small group of humans

who decided to make a power

play and rip off all these ideas and

then um trademark them and say you'll

die forever and be punished forever and

blah blah blah unless you do exactly

what we say and on and on and on um but

the the goal was to be absolutely

free from being

compelled by the animal aspects of who

you who you are as a human being and so

an inversion right what happens is the

soul the sort of of underneath of you

right flips over and becomes on the top

and the animal aspects are subjugated to

it instead

of your soul Powers being subjugated to

your animal aspects which is miserable

suffering it's like a fish not knowing

what water is and not being ever being

in water right this is how most of us

live who live like this a bird never

having

flown you know a snake never having

slithered

um go

ahead yeah well I think death is more

like a latent potentiality within life

rather than an event at the end of the

life

process so death is more like an

everpresent possibility within life

itself so it can only be realized

within

life that's brilliant yeah so you have

to die while you're alive in order to

experience it it's not at the end of

life I suppose that's what I mean it's

actually there's no way to die that

doesn't happen in

life right yeah it's like Sunrise can

only happen in the

nighttime there's no other way for that

to happen

right yeah but but like life and death

aren't separated by an interval I

suppose that's what I mean what I mean

to say is that death is within life

itself within the waking experience of

life it hovers over what life itself is

as opposed to being at the end of life

so um to actualize death is is

initiation so there's a I think there's

a there's a

dimension um there's a dimension to life

which when

actualized uh yields this kind of occult

um

influx of information which I think

proceeds from this

uh uh the same force that we attribute

to death that we call death there's a

there's a there's a relationship or a

link

there that's absolutely brilliant um

obviously this is well known throughout

many

Traditions

um in Zen

uh I can't remember who it

was might have been Sasaki

roshi who said something

like um die the man who dies once on the

pillow will never taste death

again right and what he means is die to

the illusory self in

meditation experience the complete

sensation of that nonsense

sense um that

illusory

deception

uh and be

rescued from all you know all

suffering you know then you can choose

things like if you want to Incarnate

again or not or what um all kinds of

things yeah

so oh

God yeah

well there's there's a similar

relationship between light and space or

light and

darkness so you know ordinarily we

imagine that light and darkness are two

opposite extremes or that they exist

along a spectrum but really Darkness and

Light interpenetrate so instead of

thinking that light is propagating

through space you could you could take

the uh the opposite stance and recognize

that space itself is within light

there's there's an inverse truth

so I guess that's also what I mean so so

to recognize that death is within life

is the same kind of act as recognizing

that space is within light there's a

there's a very similar uh I think um

structure there yeah most people would

find that terribly counterintuitive I

don't

um it's absolutely

brilliant that you say things like this

uh

you know one of the ridiculous features

of human

cognition is to take aspects of

existence as

separate

right

and I guess you could imagine a box in

which there's no light right you could

say like well inside this box we created

a situation where it's there's no there

are no photons in there okay great but

the box is in the

universe how will you evict the universe

from the box right you have the UN you

the box is already in something that is

swimming in light time space beings G

you know awareness intelligence all

these things so you can you know you can

make a box inside which you think

there's absolutely

nothing right um

absolute zero right but the box you made

the

box so so how can you evict your making

of the box from the

box and the universe you are an

expression of the universe the box is an

expression of the universe so you might

think like no we can make nothing in

there there's nothing you're wrong

you're just wrong there's no way to make

nothing right yeah I mean that also I

think think you know to some

extent

um illuminates what you were saying

about the

um the dream world so what illuminates

the dream

image right um you know so we tend to

think that light illuminates an image so

you know we think that the beam of light

like a flashlight in a dark room

illuminates some kind of um you know

spatial or spatially extended image but

you can take the opposite stance and

recognize that the light beam itself

contains an image so the image is within

the light it's the exact opposite you

know yeah this is one of yeah see this

kind of intelligence is so rare it's one

of the reasons I adore your mind you're

a very unique intelligence as a human

being one of the most unique

intelligences I have ever come across

keep going by all means and go go to the

dyspepsia let's let's have the [ __ ]

Comm yeah let's right yeah yeah because

it's exactly what you're saying these

religions weren't there to cause you to

worship beings you didn't first of all

let me just be really clear about

something it is impossible to

worship that which you

are that which makes you and sustains

you moment to moment um it's not

impossible to adore it but worship

worship would be like if I constantly

sang George's Praises with no having no

experience of George at

all and and actually refusing to have

any contact with George so what I'm

trying to get at

is if you were to touch if the

origin world were to emerge even

partially in your

awareness you would instantly sing and

dance and adore it helplessly there's

nothing you can possibly do to stop

those things from happening your soul

would ring like the sun with familiarity

recognition awe Wonder ecstasy Joy um

Freedom you would just your whole being

would just ring like a bell and I know

this because I've experienced it

directly it's the opposite of worship

you can't help it it's like a bird

flying or a heart beating there's

nothing you can do that could possibly

intervene in that if this were to touch

your awareness while you're you know

awake or

dreaming and so this idea of worship is

what happens only after that goes

away right so it's like oh you put me in

a prison where I can't feel my nature or

origin then I could start praying or

something like

worshiping um something that I have no

real experience of or very little

experience of and I'm just trying to say

that it's like the backwards thing

you're talking about where they think

light

illuminates it's of course reasonable to

think the light illuminates things but

there's something that illuminates your

mind without which you can't recognize

light or illumination or anything right

um and so originally these uh many of

these spiritual experiences were um

oriented as

medicine um

renewal Resurrection healing the death

of um the blindness of our common

day-to-day waking experience The

Reawakening of Wonder and awe an

ecstasis um and also intellect go ahead

right well this is what ties it back to

Coca-Cola because uh John pton

originally marketed Coca-Cola as an

herbal tonic it was supposed to be like

a a miraculous cure for all sorts of

ailments like indigestion headaches and

fatigue um but over time it it basically

became the product of marketing hype and

I think something similar happened in

Christianity you can you can actually

trace the the history that the editorial

history of the books of the New

Testament um to see how they were uh

interpolated or modified and then

compiled with this clear like editorial

strategy and a the logical design which

I think people like amen Hillman

actually misunderstand to some extent

like you can't read the books of the

Bible independently because the theology

is baked in and they were written with

respect to each other by a single group

of people so uh so the theology is there

it isn't something that you superimpose

on the text it's something that you're

supposed to uh to glean by Design um a

very specific message that you're

supposed to take away from reading the

text so

um I think amond Hillman gets that wrong

but uh what do you think he

thinks well he seems to think that the

gospel of Mark is a historical document

or even like you know the Gospel of Luke

which clearly they aren't they were

written probably over the span of 10

years by maybe the same person or a

single group of people so he seemed I

mean he I think amen Hillman is aware

that um the gospel of Mark is based on

homeric episodes

um I think he knows about Dennis

McDonald and uh like literary mimesis or

mimesis

criticism um but he I think he where he

airs is in thinking that

Jesus

performed these acts that Mark describes

I don't think that's like as if it's a

historical document that's not I don't

think that's what it is at

all

um so so because Mark is aware of

Paul and because Paul was probably an

ahistorical person like a confabulated

literary construct designed by the

protoc Catholic church or the Proto

Orthodox Church to counter

marcionism um Mark and Paul have a

unified theological

message and that message is centered on

grounding the character of

Jesus

in in a specific Jewish context which

probably wasn't there to begin with so

um basically to judaize this character

to give him a Jewish genealogy to give

him a place on Earth because marcion you

know contended that Jesus was some kind

of alien that descended from space and

he was a fully grown human being without

a birth narrative or without even a

resurrection narrative um sort of like a

like a holographic projection so that

that position was called dotism and it

was called a heresy by the early church

but it seems to have been marcion's

position

so because maranis was gaining

popularity in the second century the

Proto Orthodox church had to publish

their own

Canon um because marcion was the first

to publish a collected volume containing

the letters of Paul and the gospel

because originally there was only one

gospel and it was Paul's

gospel um whereas these editors and

these redactors that came later um

between like 155 and 166 ad roughly in

that window of time um yeah they they

came up with this four-fold gospel

message really as a symbolic act um

because you know there are four winds

and there are four there are four

pillars on the earth

dire yeah um and of course this this

four-fold structure in the gospels is

based on helenistic rhetoric and

platonism and and

stoicism uh really has nothing to do

with Jesus I mean um so so basically if

you read the gospels in order as you

were designed as you were supposed to

read them um you begin with Matthew and

then you proceed to Luke through Mark

but this this structure is a dialectic

which has a

deliberate uh purpose you're supposed to

move from Matthew to

Luke in order to transcend the dialectic

in the gospel of Mark so transcending

the dialectical structure the optic

gospels is uh really an old Motif within

like the platonic dialogues it's uh yeah

it's an old rhetorical device

so yeah

it's it's a it's a theologically

designed polemical document and it's

directed against marcionism

so because because marcionism was like

Pepsi okay um just like Pepsi it was

bold it was disruptive and it was

increasingly popular right just like

marianismo stripped down and uh like

easily accessible for for the average

person

um because no one had to obey Jewish law

in order to be a Christian according to

marcion so he totally rejected the Old

Testament he thought that you know the

god of the Old Testament was this being

called the demiurge who was effectively

like what Paul calls Satan

when Paul talks about Satan in his

letters um he really seems to be

describing this archonic being called

the Dem which was the same being that

created

Humanity um or gave Humanity these these

physical bodies so like in Genesis when

when God clothes Adam and Eve in in

skins the Gnostic reading of that uh

that um book of the

Bible was really that skins or garments

or clothing were effectively what the

human body was so so the human body is

like a suit or some kind of suit that

you wear it is

yeah right so in order to so to become a

Christian you have to you have to

develop this like this other kind of

suit which is tailored to a Heavenly

ecology so when you die you acquire this

new Heavenly dwelling which is literally

like an astral body of some kind that

can Traverse yeah Som

pneumatic the Som pneumatic yeah yeah

it's it's it's an actual body of some

kind with a corporeal presence but it's

it's more like a photonic body or a body

I don't know if corporeal is the right

word what do you mean by that word maybe

I'm

misunderstanding um feel free to correct

yourself if you so it has some kind of

Elemental presence yeah yeah yeah it's

it's a mode like a UFO basically a UF

has a corporeal presence right but it

isn't entirely

physical okay I got you yeah it can sort

of phase in and out of existence because

it's based on like the propagation of

light or something yeah or the

propagation of what time space emerges

from or something yeah precisely yeah

yeah but the Cola Wars followed the same

structure which is really bizarre if you

look at uh like the history of soft

drinks and uh the competition between

Coca-Cola and Pepsi the fact that

Coca-Cola was losing market share in

this in the in the 20th century and had

to

adopt a more Pepsi like Flavor in the

form of New Coke is precisely what

happened in the 2 century when the

Catholic Church interpolated

goel so it's it's the same guy like the

same being over and over again it's like

it's it's the demiurge or something dude

like

yeah keep going that just blows my

[ __ ] mind the most hilarious

comparison I think I ever heard in my

life keep going yeah because Coke is the

perfect object it's it's basically it's

a God on Earth so if you if you look at

Coke the sense in which a bottle of

Coca-Cola is the perfect object is

that like it it basically abides by all

these bizarre laws of desire and and it

seems to have been manufactured through

a similar kind of process of like

competition and like certain cycles of

addiction or habit formation so it's

it's part of expiration under addiction

yeah I'm I'm with you go

ahead

yeah right like like the inspiration

that results from the most addictive

thing you can possibly produce or the

inspiration that

chases the possibility space of

addiction in such a way as to produce

cocacola and the bottle and the logo and

you know and the marketing and all

that like if you look at the shape of

the bottle itself the shape of the

bottle activates

certain certain complexes in the human

mind so like the shape is designed to

look like the outline of the female body

right it also has certain like phallic

connotations which is interesting so it

functions like this kind of totem like a

like a like like a shamanic object or a

like a fetish right

um actually it functions like the image

of a

God yeah except

deprived it's the Proto form of a God

right it's what you'd get if you took

the human features away right and the

animal features away and you just

represented the

principles themselves yes well my claim

is that that's what a totem

is totem is the Incarnation of a God but

its

Incarnation usually assumes a more

technical guise eventually because the

the point of origin is eventually lost

or forgotten so it turns into this

utilitarian object but

um I think yeah Coke is sort of like in

this uh holy [ __ ] that's what tools are

y that's what the computers are that's

what our cars are that's what our

smartphones are yeah

exactly so once okay once you get

past there's a process right where the

God you know the the totem or the being

that is a being coded in the form of an

idol as that

becomes as you

subtract the human plant and animal

features from it more and more

eventually you get a

tool and then what you get instead of

those features is

function right you get the thing it does

the magic thing it does

yeah I mean a watch is

magical a car is

magical even a lock and a key that's a

magic fact right to open the

way please

continue oh absolutely yeah the function

of an object as a technical object is

always

Downstream from this more original

devotional or symbolic point of origin

so I think that applies to any technical

object like an automobile or a

computer I think it also applies to a

fork certainly yeah a knife you know a

spoon yes all that stuff right y I'm

with you keep

going uh well yeah I mean so in so far

as Mark is aware of Paul and in so far

as Paul was probably Simon Magus or some

kind of Street magician

um yeah the books of the Bible aren't

historical documents they're designed to

convince you of something it's basically

like a marketing campaign so it works

just like Coca-Cola man like it's the

same exact structure like timeline like

the the amount of time that it took to

compile these books I think is is um

synchronous with the uh the new coke uh

campaign that was that was sort of

spearheaded in response to the po it of

Pepsi so it was a rapid kind of process

so the books of the Bible were probably

compiled over a decade they weren't

written over the course of generations

and then organically compiled uh like in

the thir Century or something the the

book that we call the New Testament or

the whole the whole bible really um both

the Old and the new as a coherent

document or a coherent book uh was

probably already around by the time of

Marcus aurelus in the 2 Century so

around like 50

ad so it was it was brought together

very early but also quite late with

respect to what most Scholars think

because most Scholars think that Mark

was written around 70 so soon after the

The Siege of

Jerusalem um and that the paulan

Epistles were written maybe around the

year

50 um but it seems more clear to me now

that the Pauline letters and Mark and

the other Gospels were were probably

written around the same time and it may

have been overseen by

polycarp um or irenaeus so it actually

has the same kind of uh structure as

like art forgeries if you look at the

the history of like forgeries like the

Hitler Diaries or how Modern Art forgers

um create what are called twin forgeries

in order to

lend themselves Credence or to create

these self-referential systems of

legitimacy um it's pretty clear to me

that like the early church fathers were

engaged in something like that it was

like um what do they call it a Pious

fraud so for the sake of for the sake of

countering marcion and destroying

marcionism they had to confabulate these

things I think that was when does

marcionism show

up where's its origin between the years

of like maybe 130 and

150 so I think yeah between between

those two or three decades marcion was

in his prime and he was in

Rome he debated polycarp in 154 or 153

ad yeah ad yeah

yeah um so marcion was basically

teaching that the god of the Old

Testament was evil or Satan he was the

first person to publish Paul's letters

as a coherent sort of collection and

some of those letters are in the in the

Bible um but his collection actually

began with Galatians not Romans okay

so which is really fascinating because

Galatians presents this Schism between

Paul and the other

Apostles um marcion seems to have taught

that Paul was the only true Apostle and

that he had no connection to the

original Apostles and you can see that

in Galatians because Paul says that he

didn't receive his gospel message from

any

man um

in fact it was a revelatory experience

for him he never actually met Jesus In

the Flesh he only ever encountered this

heavenly

vision uh or series of Visions uh he

only met the apostles two or three times

and they were all seemingly um like

antagonistic um and he sort of recounts

that in Galatians which is pretty

fascinating so that seems to have been

the followup to mark because if you read

the gospel of Mark it ends rather

abruptly and there's no Resurrection

narrative and there's also no birth

narrative so that's sort of like what

marcion was

saying so later what happened is that

these redactors came in and they gave

Jesus a Jewish

background and they also tried to

harmonize Paul with the other Apostles

like in the Acts of the Apostles yeah

because probably what Paul had written

was too powerful to

Omit is my guess right it's like an

ingredient in in the coke right yeah ex

cocaine right right it's the cocaine and

the Coca-Cola you can't get rid of that

so you have to explain it in

terms aine with your with the myth

you're trying to make well no Paul was

originally considered a heretic he was

actually the father of all heresies he

was called Simon Magus so he was a

polarizing figure in the early church

but then they had to re they had to

rehabilitate His Image so they had to he

was called Simon

Magus

yes um did you is this common knowledge

how did you come to know this this is

unfamiliar to

me so the gnostics all traced their

teachings back to Paul who was called

Simon megus by Justin

Martyr um as well as in the pseudo

Clementine

writing um yeah the pseudo Clementine

recognitions uh contain a lot of

information about Simon

magas and so the Catholic Church the

Proto Orthodox Church um seems to have

conflated this figure that we now call

Paul with Simon megus who was the father

of

gnosticism

so and how would you um I don't mean to

interrupt please keep going I have a

question

though so the only place where Simon

Magus appears in the Bible is in the

Acts of the Apostles and he's framed as

this person this individual this

magician

who was um really in opposition to Peter

and if you read Galatians you'll see

that that's precisely who Paul was so

whoever Paul was he basically Paul was

never a historical person in the sense

that you know Paul may have went by that

name I I think Paul is some kind of

literary construction not unlike Jesus

himself like an amalgam of several

people sort of like Santa Claus like

Santa Claus is an amalgam of several

different people he's not

yes

you so viewing viewing Paul and Jesus as

these composite ideological

constructs makes sense of the history of

this whole movement because because

similar phenomena have have recurred in

history it's not just that Jesus never

existed it's that you know people like

Ned ludd never existed or you know King

Arthur it's King Arthur right it's like

King Arthur no one thinks that King

Arthur was a historical person very few

people do but irrespective of that the

same process was at work because the

same sociopolitical process took place

in different parts of the collapsing

Roman Empire so in England the collapse

of the Roman Empire yielded this Legend

of King Arthur whereas in the near East

it yielded this Legend of Jesus but I

think it was the exact same process that

gave rise to

them and and that's

don't acknowledge they don't they don't

go that

far say say that again

please most mythicists don't go that far

they don't see the connection between

Jesus King Arthur or or the cargo Cults

that that developed in the 20th century

as a function of military Invasion and

so on like that's what the Roman Empire

was doing that's that's how I think how

these figures became historicized

retroactively they were sort of

retroactively historicized

uhhuh so it's

um okay so now what we

have is you take some kind of a basic

ideological

doll right the doll of a

Messianic

being um a rescuer a

reincarnator in fact you're you're

actually taking it could be understood

that you're taking the doll of the anom

or the um

psychopomp operate in for example the

mysteries of alfis I'm using Maria

maru's pronunciation she's actually

Greek and demands that we pronounce it

properly and I'm fully willing for

really important

reasons

um you're taking something

like uh alond Hillman's

Medusa right the one that

introduces the other world in death

death to the

LIE right which is one of the things

that Aman is profoundly

motivated and is is fairly certain that

he's accomplishing right he's trying to

kill a bunch of Lies that's what he

thinks he's

doing um so you take the stall of the

LIE

killer right and then what you do is you

just dress it up historically

um

mythologically textually you do this by

stealing entire histories right you

judaize Jesus you kify

Arthur

um and so what you do is you wrap this

coke bottle right you wrap the coke

bottle until it looks like something

familiar to the people you want to

enchant with it yes yes precisely yeah

and then it becomes the real

thing yes yeah exactly right because

things aren't real there are no real

things reality belongs to origin not

things go

ahead if you look at the um yeah the old

Coke

advertisements uh with the with the

songs and the

jingles you can you can see you can see

the Christian element like or it's the

same it's the same Force

it's the same Force either way

yeah so how do you sell brown sugar

water that's the question

like how do you make brown sugar water

the real thing that's you know

um I mean brown sugar is pretty amazing

all by itself so it's probably you don't

have a big job right it's not going to

be real tough just get people to taste

that brown sugar water

it mostly takes care of itself so then

one of the things you do is just add

some

cocaine it's a stimulant right it's a

stimulant that that's exactly what it is

right

yeah so it it feeds into these cycles of

addiction so it's a feedback loop it's

its own

support all of this has to do with

counterfeiting origin for the sake

of um

creating systems of authority in human

persons and

cultures right so that um some group or

person can be

authorized by people

outside right right exactly

it's an authorization

con which is exactly the opposite of

what was going on in

alfis right it's nothing like what was

going on in alfis there was no con it

was the opposite of a con I

think yeah The Taste of coke is both

bitter and sweet but you also forget the

taste of coke quickly so you can you can

have more than one Coke in a day but

but you because you quickly forget the

taste you find yourself drawn back and

and the suds the Fizz yeah the Fizz the

Fizz actually releases endorphins so

it's it's really just an experience of

pain that's what the that's what the

Fizz actually induces so it releases

these endorphins that that people find

pleasurable but it's just a pain

receptor it's really really

fascinating but I think Christianity has

a similar kind of uh kind of structure

H say

more yeah

well you know most Christians I think

implicitly agree with

marcion in the sense that in my

experience like most Christians that I

tend to meet

um they they usually just reject the Old

Testament entirely

but the pleasure that attends being a

Christian right or you know loving Jesus

or whatever the case might be

um really seems to

be about like swapping or trading these

subjective Impressions so it it sort of

works like um like be abub so so what

most people call

Jesus is really no different

from from The Lord of the Flies or or be

elub because in the Bible be elub was

used as this kind of

uh like this uh a like a meditative Aid

so you can imagine how like uh someone

who who meditates on like the buzzing of

a fly's wings or any insect can use this

kind of noise as a vessel for their own

Enlightenment it works just like a test

and the whole Bible is like a rack test

but if you meditate on babbling water or

you know the the sound of a bugs Wings

flapping you'll start to see certain

patterns but those patterns emerge out

of your own your own mind basically

they're they're a reflection of your own

identity so you're seeing an aspect of

yourself in the noise it's it's

basically just chaos it's just like an

interference pattern out of which this

holographic projection emerges right um

and that's what I think most Christians

are doing when they read the Bible

they're they're looking at a bunch of

white noise because you know the Bible

contains all sorts of contradictions and

it's not internally consistent but as

you as you move through it you're

basically just engaging in a a self

imposed RoR Shack test and you see

aspects of your own identity reflected

back at you and that can be therapeutic

I think

um but it's really no different from you

know worshiping beah because that's what

shamans were doing I mean they were just

they were listening to the the Lord of

the Flies and and the Lord of the Flies

would give them information upon

meditating on the interference pattern I

mean it's just you know

so um but that's exactly what like the

Fizz it's it's exactly like what what

takes place in worshiping this coke

bottle basically it's it's no

different I'm having trouble at the

moment

trying to figure out whether what you're

saying is like profoundly

enlightening or a kind of pure um

cynical

nihilism I can't

tell you have anything to say about

that well I mean history is repeating

itself so you can you can read that

nihilistically I

suppose I if hisory were repeating

itself then there might be cause to be

cynical I suppose but I'm that's not

really my angle okay great I'm I'm glad

to hear that because I I mean personally

I'm not big on cynicism or or

nihilism um I tend to believe in a

meaningful and profound um

understructure to

existence it's not it's my belief it's

it's not a thinking thing it's more like

the thing that makes thinking possible

for me or you know like Like An Origin

thing no what I'm describing I think

exists in the sense that like it has

some kind of metaphysical relevance or

physical relevance to

me

um it's like a control system so the

control system recurs it has certain

ways of Heming intelligence in

um but I don't think it's localized to

the human mind or the human

body when I when I describe these

relationships that's really what I'm

trying to get at I'm trying to get at

this more General

Force yeah this control system is very

interesting it's

something that occurs across a broad

range of thought and

literature um I'm particularly thinking

about

uh the black Iron prison of Philip K

dick um a system of social control that

obscures the true nature of

reality uh I don't know how familiar

with dicks work you are of course um the

work of actual dicks is our own bodies

but I mean Philip

K I know more about his life than I do

anything about his his writings

unfortunately yeah it's

fine um though I strongly

recommend uh reading valus if nothing

else which is an acronym standing for

vast active living intelligence

system yeah I think I think Philip K

dick was a true

Mystic oh he was um

yeah he

was uh his exegesis is pretty pretty

mind

ripping and stands among stands

out uh as a truly

incredible I don't even know what to

call it a

transcendental it's okay so it's you

know we would say well it's just a text

dude it's a book it's not really a book

it's not really just a

text um

um it is possible to compose things in

text that transcend the possibilities of

ordinary

text and um thereby transform the

category of the

object into something

transcendental of course this is

what

uh this is what

we this is what it is said the Bible in

the Quran and the Torah and so forth

right

um the difference though I

think I don't

know I know the story of how the the

Quran was

composed I don't know how it was

actually

composed the Bible is weirder the Bible

is definitely

Franken San right it's a bunch of stuff

stitched together it seems very

obviously that's to me do you do you see

it

similarly uh yeah I do more or less yeah

I mean I think the Bible has a unified

message but it contains contradictions

which is yeah really fascinating um well

it's not just that it contains

contradictions it's that it's stitched

to

together yeah it wasn't like some people

sat down over the years in in generation

after generation and composed this one

document that could thereby be

essentially

univocal

um it's much

weirder it's it's an assemblage right

it's

a what do they call this pieces of art

where you

just you know you just

put different things into

it

collage H yeah there's there's a more

complex word like a French word I

think that means like

um to knit together disparate kinds of

objects uh I'm just I can't find it in

my vocabulary at the moment

um the exegesis which is I think over

3,000 pages of material written mostly

by Han by Philip K dick in the aftermath

of a religious experience that I think

lasted less than a few

hours

um was definitely helpful for

me obviously after reading something

like that like like many people

would I I began to hope that that like

that I could somehow understand what

would generate such an experience how

could I have an experience like

that

um I certainly did not believe or

realize that it was possible for me to

have such an experience I didn't think

that was possible nonetheless I wanted

desperately uh to have such an

experience

and much to my surprise I eventually had

an experience that you know I

think I don't know was like a

thousandfold unless what what dick

experienced unless um what dick

experienced was just exactly the same

thing compressed into a much

smaller uh temporal

interval it's certainly very simil

although I was less inclined to try to

understand the black Iron prison and

much more inclined to try to

understand um features of the

historicity of the development of

Consciousness in our species that led to

the problems that

we struggle with and

experience uh today and you know

throughout human history it's been going

on forever essentially

um but yeah the exegesis is very trippy

there's like a 900 page book now there

used to be I have a bunch of books about

it right there was this book called

um uh in pursuit of valus selections

from the

exegesis

um and I had that

before uh the exegesis edited by Pamela

Jackson and John

letham was

available that book is um enormous I

mean how many pages is it let me look is

it like a

[Music]

thousand it's 950 pages

long and someone recently I know we're

getting a bit off topic here we can

return to the to the core shortly but

somebody recently I came across I think

he was lying but I'm not positive he was

lying

um he claimed to have a 25 volume

leatherbound edition of the

entire uh

exegesis I can't find any evidence of

that

existing um so I think he was

lying uh or you know having me on I was

really he was a really trippy cat very

very intelligent person

musician um

you

know I guess what I'm trying to

understand George is how you see the

Bible because you talk about it on the

one

hand in the sense of it being sort of

white noise that since it is incoherent

since it's fundamentally incoherent or

as you said

chaotic um you can get anything you want

out of it it seem this seems to be one

of the ways you understand the Bible am

I reading

that well no it looks like chaos but it

is

coherent okay so like um like an

interference pattern looks

chaotic but an interference pattern

contains an image just like a beam of

light

so so the contradictions are more like a

balancing act just like um in

Shakespeare so in a Shakespeare Ian play

characters present opposing points of

view which

nevertheless uh constitute a unified

work so the Bible is quite similar to

that kind of but we are also similar to

that I am similar to that yes right this

is why yeah this is

why uh um methods like internal family

systems are particularly useful or

effective it seems to me because they

take into

account this

uh multiplicity right like there seems

to be a sort of a dichotomy a

fundamental

dichotomy between the unity and the

facets that comprise

it and if you go with the facets it

looks like babbling

multiplicity and if you go with the

unity it looks like univocality

it's neither right yeah yeah right is it

particle is it wave oh

God yeah well the Bible contains its

own uh cancellation within itself so

yeah the Bible contains its own opposite

within

itself I guess that's what I mean by

contradiction so

it's

yeah I mean I'm I think think that's how

I am

too right yeah and that's that's yeah

that that's how it

propagates so the gospel of Mark is like

the atheist text so it contains atheism

within it and in fact Christianity is

probably the result of atheism if you go

back to um the presocratic

and the actual Genesis of monotheism as

I think amen Hilman tentatively

suggests uh monotheism is probably

Downstream from presocratic manism which

was associated with um

rejecting the existence of the Gods like

Zeus because it was really bound up with

um understanding the weather and

meteorology and other natural phenomena

without appealing to the authority of

the Gods and I think Socrates and Plato

mediated that transmission to what we

today call Judaism but um I think

Judaism was probably the result of this

platonic um

ambience in um in the helenistic world

so so Judaism is much younger than we

usually

suppose and and the the gap between

Judaism and Christianity is much

narrower than we usually suppose so

they're they they both originated in the

same Crucible it's not as if

Christianity necessarily stemmed from

Judaism I think that's I think that's a

mistake they were like siblings that

that had the same parent if that makes

any

sense so I want to bring us in a

direction

briefly or we carefully

examine a feature of our own moment to

moment awareness and

experience it's an

organ in the anatomy of what I'm going

to call Consciousness right to be

awakened aware and it functions very

differently um if we are asleep and

dreaming uh from what we will experience

when we are awake and this

organ is the organ of

authorization I think if you look back

over recent

uh speakings it's not the word I wanted

but I'll use

it um in our conversation now you will

discover including uh in this moment

while I am speaking right now that in

order to speak something I must

authorize it within myself I have to

believe that it is useful I have to have

some way of believing that is useful

true or important good desirable

something

right and in order to do

that this requires a a system within my

awareness that authorizes it is this

clear at all what I'm

saying yeah I think it's clear

okay so I want us to pay attention to

the functioning of that system for a

moment you will notice that in order to

emit the statement I just made I want us

to pay attention to the function of that

system I must first authorize that

statement I will not emit those words if

I have not first authorized them is that

clear yes great yeah

excellent so you can see that there is a

fundamental system that is operating

beneath our ordinary awareness we use it

every time we make can move in

Consciousness every time

we

um

enact our Consciousness we enact it it's

not just there it's not like we're

swimming in the water and so we're

always wet that's not what happens

especially not while we're awake

something a bit more like that happens

While We're

Dreaming um but while we're awake prior

to engaging in an act of consciousness

and particularly the act of

speaking uh there is usually beneath our

awareness A system that is functioning a

system of

authorization and what's going on

historically you can see this

happening is that there's a

transfer

of

authorization um from

wow

okay I'm not sure I'm not sure I can

imagine that there's a transfer from

something like um ambient communal

consensus right we

together what would we all most desire

and agree to right if if we are 50

people in a tribe or something what

would we all most desire and agree

to um that could be the original source

of

authorization of course there must be

layered arrays of

authoritative aspects

to human

awareness activity and so forth um so

that the sky right the

sun the sun is blatantly obvious

Authority um if it should change slight

everything dies or life becomes

extremely difficult um whether it's too

hot or it's too cold you know things are

going to go wrong um the moon clearly is

an

authority um similarly the Stars so

forth but what I'm getting at is there

was a transfer over time of authority

from

living fundamental aspects of our

existence our existence and experience

like the sun the moon stars the mountain

the

river um the moon cycles right not just

the moon the cycles of the

Moon um the women's Cycles in their

bodies uh the cycles of um emergence

flourishing and syence in the land in

the living places and the animals and

the insects and all these things which

were immediately con creete to our Human

Experience not like they are for us

moderns where we know they happen

somewhere but they don't much happen in

our cities which have mostly evicted all

of that and made a bunch of dead

structure

um so what I'm getting at is that

eventually what happened is that

authorizations started to become

personated as gods and then sometime

later this weird personation thing I

love this word by the way to

personate um this personation

thing we threw away the facets which

were the gods ofius Zeus Poseidon aena

Deiter

peropon um

Aphrodite Athena Cleo Siri Corey

um just you know to go with the Greek

pantheon part of the Greek

pantheon we threw all that away and then

we just

um

decided not we that's the wrong word it

wasn't we didn't make any decisions what

what was happening was a

process in the in the

development of communal

human um thought systems right that

underly that sort of Encompass us rather

than emerge from any person but one of

the evolutionary problems was this

concept of

monotheism where the authority becomes

effectively

disperson right it's no longer

personated as Zeus or

Hermes or you know um

media

now it's deerson you have the coke

bottle right the coke bottle of

monotheism yeah no one will know his

name you cannot know his shape he is

featuress but the source of all features

he is abstract

Authority absolute infinite in

unknowability as he is in power

omniscent omniscient

omnipresent right

uh tear it up go wherever you want to go

this is the first time I've seen this in

my mind yeah precisely yeah the god of

Paul or the god of Christianity is

really an unknown god of love that was

what Paul seemed to be preaching so he

was he was espousing something like

apophatic or negative theology the idea

that God the all powerful

God is devoid of predicates sort of like

the idea of the one in neoplatonism or

in

platinus the Transcendent Unity

that governs almost physically the uh

the lawfulness of the terrestrial sphere

so when Paul looked at the earth I think

what he probably saw was something like

the lawfulness of Elemental interactions

so he he refers to to the archons that

um

control the planet as these demonic

forces or Satan

um but he also seems to espouse this

notion of ether

or this more Heavenly domain so like in

in Aristotle for example the terrestrial

sphere was separate from the celestial

sphere and the lawfulness of the sphere

was eternal and it was governed by

certain

Cycles whereas the elements on Earth are

more rectal linear they um they they

flow from these Cosmic forces that

descend from the

stars um and this was also an alchemical

Motif the idea even in stoicism of these

um rational seeds uh that descend from

the heavens so so the idea of the logos

was was ultimately transmitted by sto

ISM to people like polycarp who who was

um active in Asia Minor where the Bible

was probably compiled um and the Gospel

of John was I

think uh sort of bound up with this

stoic understanding of physics so yeah

so stoic physics I think is the ultimate

teaching of the Bible in in the Gospel

of John you're supposed to read the

Gospel of John after progressing through

the synoptic dialectic these these first

three books that a trinity um the fourth

book is this more Transcendent level and

I think that was a a deliberate

rhetorical device but um yeah so Paul

seems to have thought that the

resurrection body was this Heavenly Body

which was exempt from the law that was

the whole point of Christianity so as a

Christian you were exempt from the law

because you possessed this heavenly

astral dwelling or or clothing like a

space suit or something um yeah through

which you could basically judge the

world so when Paul talks about

expression body it's an expression body

but please continue sorry yeah yeah yeah

so when Paul talks about judgment when

he talks about how human beings will

eventually judge the angels and judge

the

Earth what he seems to be referring to

is this um this astral agency so in the

same way that the Stars govern the

motion of the terrestrial elements the

photonic body of the elect will govern

something about the motion of you know

the terrestrial elements on Earth in

time during the perusia so when you know

when Jesus comes back because Paul

thought that Jesus would actually come

back from the heavens he was some kind

of ET basically who was going to come

back and and and transform the entire

material plane so so the whole material

plane would be metamorphosed it would be

transformed that was what he was was

saying so it's really only intelligible

in this broader context of how the

ancient Greeks understood the elements

in their interactions and there was also

an alchemical Dimension to it

because uh the alchemical dimension was

also bound up with the transmission of

these astral seeds or these astral forms

in order to transform material bodies

that was the whole point of of the

alchemical work or the alchemical lus

and so there's a very clear link between

nosism and the alchemical tradition in

Egypt um around the thir Century ad so

sometime after

Paul um yeah so when we talk the law or

judgment in Christianity we're really

talking about a physical process that

that I think Paul was was was aware of

it's not like this abstract you know

legalistic uh no it's um basically a

transform of something resembling the

laws of

physics

yes and this all makes sense to me

experientially

because

um I I mean this is gonna sound weird I

kind of don't care this is one of the

one of the reasons we do this one of the

reasons we get together is so that we

can say the

things that we ache to

say but ordinarily we are not in a

context where is either possible that

they will be

understood or that they will not just be

outright rejected but in any

case after that long and bizarre apology

what I'm going to say

is okay I'll start out somewhat

didactically so it strikes me that there

are two kinds of texts

historically there are texts that were

written by humans

who had Direct

experience of divine

matters and they wrote from that

experience but they could not write

without okay this is one of the weird

things when you have an experience which

is

outside it is from Beyond your normal

array of experiences and it is from

Beyond what humans normally will speak

of or write of together then you are

challenged

I know this firsthand to determine how

you will interpret the experience and

whether or not you will adopt Authority

from existing Traditions that what I

said there is really important because

if you don't adopt Authority from

existing

Traditions you will have to establish

Authority for the first time on your own

for your narrative or your

description or you know whatever it is

you hope to reveal to the

humans and this is fundamentally

problematical it's an aspect of

something that happens every single time

in history that humans have experience

that is from outside the The Narrative

structure of

familiar

um models of the world existence the

Divine the holy and so forth you have to

do one of two two things essentially you

have to either adopt Authority from

existing

narratives and say you know I am the new

Jesus right I will tell you I'm writing

the third Testament right or you have to

just do you know your own damn thing and

even if you read Dix exegesis you're

going to see him doing the same thing

right what he ends up doing is talking

about his

experience in um Christian Gnostic terms

so first realize that right you you you

have to

basically I mean almost all in fact

representational

cognition is a

game where Authority existing Authority

structures are acknowledged

modified um fossilized and transferred

across

Generations this is what Alfred corsky

calls time binding

um all right so there's that but here's

what I'm going to try to

say more or less ex cathedra from the

chair of direct

experience when toy maker was with my

mind

um it was unlike anything I ever

imagined possible I know I always say

this but I really mean this in a deep

way I never imagined anything like this

was possible I was

driven by

forces in my

emotional my psyche was replaced by

something that I absolutely

trusted and I could see what was wrong

and never do it I I was it was like I

became

pure law is required for blind

people you need law if there are

idiots right if the inner son that would

normally

naturally rescue you from stupidity and

viciousness and wrongdoing most of which

is really just just ignorance right it's

not like I don't I don't know if I

believe in the existence of evil Toy

Maker didn't really show me things about

evil what he showed me was

occlusion of the Divine occlusion of the

Divine is the only explanation you

really need though you can use the the

of evil and things like the Demi urge

and stuff he told me stories of what he

called the first Angel showed me stories

of this Angel which is not evil in fact

there wouldn't be anything at all if

that angel didn't exist there would be

nothing so there's no organ of existence

that you can do away with and now

everything's

good um what you can do away with is is

the

absence of the inner Sun naturally you

will not

it would never occur to you to go

against it if it is shining in your

heart it's just like um water making you

wet right you can't imagine unwet if

you're just always wet in this way so to

speak and so what I'm getting at

is one is freed from laws by in my view

anyway from my direct experience of

something I know to be divine you don't

have to believe me I'm not trying to

convince you I'm just speaking from my

own experience and anyone who's

listening I'm not asking you to believe

me right I'm just talking about what I

remember in my own

words I was free from laws in

that you need laws primarily

[Music]

when catastrophically

deed like in various indigenous cultures

throughout history not all of them um

the unity of the people was so found

that the idea of having rules was

ridiculous they would never consider it

there was no such thing as a rule in

many cultures including those some of

those around the Great Lakes when the

French encountered

them um they had nothing like the

formalization of laws and even in my

interview with alen Hillman one of the

funny points is when I talk about like

you know you and I are friends we don't

have to have an agreement that you won't

kill my

children that you won't steal my house

that you won't like rape my wife we

don't what do we're friends we don't

have to like there's something that

pervades over our relational space

that's inherently there without being

stipulated and part of the reason I know

this is from before toy maker it's from

when I was

little and when I was

little it never occurred to me to try to

hurt another child

ever my father had to threaten me right

he's like you can if that boy hits you

and you don't hit him I'm G to hit you

so you figure out which person you want

to [ __ ] with right this is what my dad

say right I mean in my father's defense

he was very concerned that I wouldn't be

able to

um that I would be bullied because I was

sensitive he was and that I wouldn't be

able to stand up for myself so he was

very worried about this he wasn't just a

demon uh the way that that sounds but

yeah so there there is a thing where um

there's a feature of our nature and our

origin and our being as humans that

is it's hard for me not to use this word

even

though it's very unclear what this word

means it is

perfect and it is not perfect in that it

is achieved as

Perfection it is perfect in that a it

does not veer

from the direction of beauty and

truth

and the depth of its beauty and Truth is

infinite so it's it's not

achievable right you cannot be it it's a

way of traveling in relation in being in

development in seeing all of these

things okay that's the end of my homy

thank you for bearing with me

this is not science

fiction actually the fiction is the

[ __ ] that we're exp while we're

awake that is lie it's just basically

lying and you can Lucid ify the lying

with acts of intelligence Insight

awareness creativity play experiment

rescue medicine love kindness right you

can lucid ify blindness in with these

things you can you can become medicine

and I like to think that in our meetings

when we're when we're doing something

amazing I think we're doing pretty good

today in my you know evaluative [ __ ]

whatever right um then we're approaching

something that more or less resembles

our our potentials for being not merely

human but for being true what are your

thoughts oh yeah I think

so yeah I think this is what most

Christians understand by

justification by faith

alone as opposed to good works right

because that was the whole point that

Paul was trying to

make say more about that point clarify

it for us

please well Paul was saying that no one

needed to abide by the law anymore no

one needed to do good works because

the law was an effect of

transgression

so so so the law pertained to living

within a body of Flesh I mean that was

what Paul seemed to be

saying so human beings were forced to

live in um suits of

skin by virtue of some primordial

transgression which was originally

disembodied I think that's I think

that's actually what Paul

saying what do you mean by that last

part that was originally disembodied

what does that mean I don't understand

yet that Adam and Eve were like Angels

which acquired bodies after

transgressing so the return to the

Angelic state or something like it was

what um Christ affected as this

um second ad obviously oh yeah God okay

so obviously there's a bunch of obvious

things here and one of them that I'll

just State briefly and then please

continue is that Christ is the tree of

life right Christ is the tree of life

that the angel was set with a spinning

sword with with a sword that spins in

every direction he is the

food

of

transcendence he is to be eaten yes yeah

yeah right yeah you have to eat him yeah

yeah so Paul was referencing Genesis and

other books uh for sure but Genesis

there's no way Genesis is judaic no

way that that's a stolen story it's

missing most of its content yeah I mean

you'll notice that even Genesis contains

two uh creation accounts among

other which yeah we're already we're

already doing the Frankenstein thing

right we're like we're trying to stitch

something together from Lost pieces

exactly yep Genesis also contains two

sources of light so the light of the

first day and the light of the fourth

day so there was some kind of primordial

light source which wasn't the Sun or the

moon or the stars that Genesis describes

so you can see these mirror images that

crop up from the very beginning and that

carry through the entire Bible I mean so

I guess that's what I meant earlier by

claiming that these contradictions are

somehow also unified it's like a a Hall

of Mirrors

I don't know if it's a hall of well I'm

not sure what makes it a Hall of

Mirrors I agree with the with the

contradictions and their

Unity um okay what the [ __ ] was I

thinking Jesus was the tree of life

right because when they okay so first of

all when toymaker I asked the main

questions I asked toym maker the whole

time I was with him were like show me

more about Genesis show me again keep

showing me show me the next Story show

me another one right and so I learned

astonishing things about the story and

the reason that I asked a lot about that

is because it seemed to me that whatever

happens at the tree of knowledge is the

fundamental problem for our people and

if we could understand that we could

make medicine for it also it should be

obvious that if you were Moses or

whoever was

writing the story about the tree

incident

one thing you definitely you would do

two things most likely the first is you

would encrypt the story so that it would

be a a weapon that would injure your

enemies the enemies of your children and

your people you would encrypt it right

you'd put poison in there so that

especially if you if your people had

been persecuted right or enslaved or

something you you would know that your

enemies first of all you're going to

write this down so your enemies are

going to get the book eventually right

and you don't want to give them your

power so what you'll give them is like

stuck snet right you'll make a

virus in this is something that humans

ignore about the Bible and they don't

get it even though it's blatantly

obvious those books destroy

cities right they make cities attack

each other and kill each

other and cities are the enemies of any

nomadic people that get keeps getting

enslaved by them so I'm just going to

mention

that the first thing you would do is

you'd put weapons in there that would

cause your enemies to kill themselves or

each other and to not mess with your

kids because they're too busy [ __ ]

each other up and the second thing you

would not do is you would not tell your

children and your

grandchildren the following you would

not

say once things were beautiful and good

then we did a bad thing and from now on

you're

[ __ ] that's not what you would

do what you would do is you would

say a bad thing happened a difficult

thing happened a difficulty was

introduced and here's the medicine for

that difficulty but you would encrypt it

so that only your children could

understand it this is my sense of what

is going on in the tree instant after

talking at Great length with angels

about it right it's a story that

contains CHS the medicine for the

problem it's not just oh the bad thing

happened now you have to wait for the

Messiah to come someday and he'll fix

you no no no

no

um all right so now that I got that out

of my out of my my M what comes next

um so you know

knowledge is partly a kind of

death When God says in the Bible when we

read in the Bible in Genesis in English

that God says um don't eat of that tree

in the midst of the

garden saying something very

complex it's not actually that there's a

tree in the garden that's not what what

it is although one of the things he's

saying it could be understood this

way um oh God should I should I tell the

story yeah yeah okay holy [ __ ] yeah I

now see this for the first time I'm

actually having Insight at the

moment

um no I don't know if I want to go

through all of this it's it's

complicated and might I'm not sure if

it's useful I'll just say it really

briefly the first Angel punched a hole

in the origin world and that hole led

into the world of material existence and

that's what could be understood as a

demiurge it's the cutting Angel and what

it does is it cuts a

hole in the origin World which is above

time and

matter and that hole becomes both a

fountain and the possibility of

incarnation for aspects of the Divine

it's as if um the whole causes in heaven

quote unquote a kind of a rain and the

rain that falls into that hole becomes

stars and beings down here so it's it's

both it's like a reverse Fountain and

that could be understood as the tree of

knowledge not an actual

tree also it could be understood that

the Proto form of the Earth where that

will be severed because nothing cannot

be severed from origin it has to be

severed to exist origin is non-existence

so for something to exist it has to be

severed and where you were severed is

your umbilical cord but the Earth the

Proto form of the earth before the earth

existed the possibility of the earth it

had to undergo this kind of

severing and the tree of knowledge can

be understood as the umbilicus where the

Earth was previously connected to heaven

and where the separating Angel is is and

When God says don't eat of the tree in

the midst this word midst in Hebrew it

comes from a a Trion root TC very few

people know this almost no one I didn't

learn this from a human I learned this

from Toy Maker it comes from tac and Tac

does not mean midst it doesn't mean in

the middle it means to cut apart to put

apart to separate so when he says don't

eat of the tree in the midst of the

garden he's saying don't eat of the tree

where the separation is this is

absolutely crucial if you want to

understand the story because the concept

of separation is the primary problem in

human cognition it is what gives you

power it's also what blinds and cripples

you because you think separation has

Primacy right it's just like the

problems we were talking about earlier

George with light you

think oh light is a separate thing when

that's

impossible there's no chance of that

being true it's only true in cognition

where you can cut apart the elements of

being and then reflect upon those parts

and then think about well how do they

fit together yeah how do you fit them

together well no there is no together

there's only Unity right I know I'm

getting kind of excited here so then you

have next to that

so he says do not eat of the tree of

life or you will die this is what's

important knowledge is a kind of death

knowledge is dead inside potential for

what would have become Insight adoration

relation Resurrection Wonder awe play

creativity

experiment why

experiment because the material universe

is

incomplete we complete it by being in it

by being as it we don't we don't

complete it as in we finish it right we

complete it in the inspired

improvisation of existence and relation

wonder and learning that's what

completes it right it's beautiful to

have amnesia because then you can play

your way back to Insight this is what I

mean by

completing so knowledge is a kind of

dead thing right it's not like

relation um it's not like kissing it's

like a photograph it's a structured dead

thing in Consciousness it's a fossilized

remains if okay if you could choose

between knowledge and insight what you

would always choose is Insight because

Insight is like wait what oh my God

whereas knowledge is like oh yeah that's

a

car well one of those things is dead

every time you look you go like that's a

car your mind dies right there it just

dies into its previous [ __ ] forged

constructs you see how that really is a

kind of death so God Is Right what he's

telling them is if you meet the angel

that makes Cuts in the manifold of

existence it will give you its toy it's

toy is a knife it's a knife in your mind

and thereafter you will become

fascinated by making cuts and you will

forget unity and you will die into

Incarnation you'll die into incarnation

you will become material you will suffer

the Amnesia of material Incarnation you

will forget your origin in nature and

you won't die actually because what'll

happen is essentially your spirit will

undergo a weird process where it dies

into

bodies and then it slowly may or may not

undergo anamnesis right the

unforgetting and then conceivably here's

where things get really interesting for

me conceivably

you will

experience what is

called um the second birth but is

actually the second death because what

dies is the

Amnesia the Amnesia dies and you are

resurrected while incarnate yeah exactly

yeah right you're resurrected while

incarnate which is the goal of the

linian Mysteries it's the promise of

Christianity however bizarrely forged

the packaging is right the wrapping

paper of that stuff is way crazy weird

and and you know confusing as hell but

the weird thing about even Christianity

is that if you just tell people that

it's possible to be born again that

might be enough to get the moving in

that direction even if the wrapping

paper is all confusing does that make

any

sense yeah absolutely so you can you can

have a religion that is completely wrong

right it's just a bunch of lies and yet

a bunch of Lies can still lead people to

authentic real red

divinization right the red divinization

of the human which is what Maria margu

the Greek MOG book is about the

divinization of man through the linian

mystery process um which is meant to put

to death the blinding pervasive

uh black Iron prison in Philip K dicks

you know uh

nomenclature put that to death into to

reestablish the sovereignty because you

actually die right you die to your

humanity and this is what I experienced

during toy maker I don't claim to be

special I don't claim to be accomplished

I'm not making any claims about me I

don't care I'm a human being just like

you are I have had experiences that I do

not understand I will be the first to

tell anyone who asks me they go like do

you know what happened to you I no but I

can talk about what happened to me

through a variety of Frameworks and I

remember what it was like and still

today when I experience Insight what I

call Insight which is the revivification

the resurrection of the possibilities of

my intelligence beyond the knowledge

that I've had previously

and somehow when we get together and do

what we're doing here this invokes that

process for me which is part of why I

come here which is what I think church

is supposed to do but doesn't

mostly yeah so I don't know what

happened but I REM I have memories of my

experiences and what it was like and

what it was like was to be mostly in the

world of actual intelligence Insight

origin and adoration and only very

partly in my Humanity

um and the promise of this so oh yeah

right both people were telling the truth

so God says eat of the tree of knowledge

you will die and the serpent who's not

Satan right it's not called Satan it's

not the adversary it's a serpent it's

very important because the

serpent it's not fundamentally evil it's

not even bad once again without the

serpent you got nothing nothing and what

you don't want is to have just the

origin world or just the the universe as

we know it that would be miserably

horrifying you don't want that what you

want is those two things together

because when they are together that is

profoundly beautiful and amazing even

though the possibility of

Amnesia uh comes to life in that

situation um it's really Prof what

happens because now that rain that comes

down into existence from the origin

World in this model that I'm playing

with in this toy I'm making of it now

that rain can become enriched in a way

that is impossible if it simply remains

in the origin World hopefully that makes

sense it can become enriched by the

adventure of incarnation which is

impossible in the origin world can't

have that there's no Adventure up there

um all right so the devil says no you

won't

die you will become makers of

Worlds and both people are right God is

right you will die the devil is right

you will not die your spirit can't die

right so what'll happen is you'll

undergo death of

incarnation you'll die to your origin

self and you'll become incarnated and

thus blinded and Miser and Miser though

you'll still experience things like

Beauty Beauty and passion and dreaming

and wonder and learning and love and all

of the virtues right you'll you'll see

the night sky oh my God right the the

mountain the river the the praying

mantis the octopus the do pot of

dolphins The Beehive all those flowers

you'll see the incredible body of

origin emerging all around you as nature

and that's really profound and also I

mean there is an analog of that there's

a metalog of that that happens in the

origin

world and there's also a between world

right there's a world where

um there's a world so to speak a

universe like origin there's nothing

there it's it's I can't explain it I've

seen it it's impossible for me to make

words about it but then there's an

interim ainal World between that world

and our

universe where Souls exist

as beings and there's a world above that

too where it's mostly like archons and

angels and so to speak there's different

ways of of thinking about it but all I

was trying to say is that both people

are right God is right you will die

knowledge will kill your your memory

you'll become very fascinated by

knowledge okay here's that's what

happens to us when we're born right

we're born without knowledge okay and

then as we develop language and

representational cognition we lose

contact with the orig or world you can

look in the child in the eyes of an

infant you will see the origin World

alive there Boom the companion is still

with the child you can see it it's right

there you may not think of it that way

but you will see it right it looks like

the infant looks like it's from Another

Universe when you look in its eyes you

can see there's another universe and

then as it starts to become

representational that those

relationships become inhibited and scler

sclerotic they're clogged and what they

are clogged by is the child's emergence

into

physicality and it's undergoing of the

processes of in languaging and

enculturation the enculturation of the

humans to live in a culture of objects

and systems and structured

lies well ordinarily I think of

knowledge is the opposite process so you

you can think of knowledge as a mode of

forgetting um If you experience

knowledge as something like a like a bag

of marbles that you carry around and

deploy like you know certain

propositions or

factoids um but I I I I experience

knowledge more in terms of what you were

describing as

um as complete completeness or

completing the being

itself so when you come to know a being

you complete it in a a certain sense

which I think anyone does even even

someone you know presumably in

ignorance

um yeah but I think I think more in

terms of turning back or

reversing the arrow of time like that's

what I that's how I tend to think of

knowledge knowledge is maybe in in my

experience different from what you're

describing but I can

see okay I can see what you're saying

too and I agree um both things can be

true uh again right just like I was

saying God says don't need to that tree

you'll die the devil says no you're not

gonna die they're both

right okay um and what it hinges on is

is the meaning that we associate with

death and in our case mine and yours

it's the meaning that we associate with

knowledge and obviously if you thought

knowledge was if you thought knowledge

was

death most of the activity that you

engage in you would stop

doing yeah well okay let me like this

yes yes but see this is the thing for

you knowledge is anamnesis it is

unforgetting the lies that built up over

history yeah right right and I agree I

agree when you complete a being the

completion of the being takes place in

perception but then that perception

opens a window to everything else

that's what I'm calling knowledge

suppose so knowledge to know one thing

is simultaneously to know all things in

disgu you just don't remember it I guess

that's what I'm

saying wait say that last part again

please to know one thing is

simultaneously to know all things but

you don't remember all things so that's

that's what I'm calling knowledge it's

this process the bridge but yeah see

this is the thing you're using knowledge

more in the term um excuse me more in

the um in the

form of intimacy with

[Music]

thought um with previously

established Frameworks and so on

yeah intimacy and I agree there is that

form of knowledge I also like a

hermeneutic circle if you were to read a

text

the intelligibility of any sentence is

really only possible if you know the

entire

text right to know one thing is

simultaneously to know all things you

just might not remember all things I

guess that's what I was saying and it's

it's it's an act of perception it's a

mode of being so knowledge and being

aren't separate for me they're one and

the same thing it's like the same act

and that's what I think that's what I

thought you were you were saying by

completeness I think you're right about

that and I immediately resonated with

that ah

so I want us to preserve both of the

definitions of knowledge that we've been

playing with in the past like half hour

um because I agree I I don't I don't see

there's any conflict I remember

though see here's my problem this is the

problem that I have having been lifted

above knowledge and tasted something

that is so like literally as if it

remade my

[Music]

bones that it is not knowledge it is

like lightning of continuous Insight

that exceeds itself every time I refer

to

it and I don't have that experience

without toy maker with my mind and yet

my mind can at the same time my mind can

approach that experience under certain

circumstances again without toy maker

with me

um having had that it led me to see what

is meant by the danger of knowledge and

one of the things that happened to me

when I was in Stockton after my father

passed

away was I was talking with Luca rad for

the first time he was in Portugal and

she's such an amazing mind a brilliant

human being I was super excited we met

through Facebook whatever I was in my

dad's backyard and something flew into

the backyard and I'm crazy about insects

and I I studied them since I was very

small I know a lot about

them um it's very uncommon that I

encounter an insect or an insect

phenomenon that I don't recognize and I

didn't recognize this thing it was huge

it was like the size of a walut flying

around the yard bright iridescent

turquoise thing

and I was absolutely um it placed me

it's like encountering an angel or um

being struck by lightning or you know an

earthquake it just [ __ ] up my when I

encounter something that I've never seen

before I don't know what it is it's

similar to being in like in a car

accident um suddenly the world is just

put into a super position experientially

for me and this happened with this

insect and then I realized oh [ __ ] it's

it looks like a [ __ ]

Scarab like the Egyptian

scarabs which were you know really

important to he as a kid and still to

this day

important and I was just absolutely

transported by this um and I wanted to

take a picture of it by the way this

happened to me last night in a dream

something really weird happened in the

dream I tried to take a picture of it I

wanted to make a video of it in the

dream and the guy I was with said no no

don't do that and I was like okay he's

like yeah that'll wreck the magic you're

trying to you're trying to save the

Magic by making a picture of it you

think that what does that do to the

actual magic like now you're not now

you're not participating in the magic

anymore now you're recording the

magic and this is a very trippy problem

for humans as you can see by the you

know the state of the internet and so on

anyway I wanted to take a picture of it

but it never landed and it flew around

for about 3 or four minutes so I got

really good look at

it and I wanted to know what it was I

wanted to see it and hold it and know

what it was I wanted the knowledge of it

yeah the kind of knowledge I'm talking

about because the kind of knowledge

you're talking about is a lot like my

experience of it while it was flying and

the kind of knowledge I'm talking about

is what happened

next about three weeks later I was

walking to the store and I found the

carcass of one of these

beetles and I picked it up and then I

could look at it I could hold it but it

was dead inside nothing alive even there

and so that's when for the first time I

began to reflect in this very specific

way

on this feature of certain kinds of

knowledge the kind of knowledge where

when you know the name of

something you mistake that for intimacy

and depth of understanding or even for

the relation ship not you but one one

makes this mistake so the first the

child's fascinated by the little birds

oh my God the little birds are here and

then the child learns those are oh those

are just

sparrows and they're still kind of

fascinated the next day but within a few

weeks they don't see the birds anymore

they just have the token Sparrow oh I

know that's a sparrow I know what that

is it's a sparrow and they ignore it so

this is one of the dangers of the kind

of knowledge I'm concerned

about love to hear anything you think

about

this oh of course I

agree

um yeah the presence of

death understanding

knowledge as a way of death or a mode of

death is pretty significant to me um

because it pertains precise it pertains

to what we were discussing

earlier about the relationship between

life and death generally or the presence

of death in life so to understand Life

as a kind of

death um yes this is where I'm going

keep going yes yeah brings me back to

that um yeah we've got it backwards we

got it backwards we think death is the

scary bad thing that happens at the end

of life no death is getting born and

life is the thing that happens when

you're

unborn right yeah

exactly and we're sitting down here

terrified of death the thing that's

terrified of death is not

you yeah what we usually call knowledge

is some kind of

aborted

malformation um which could be

transformed along another route

I think and that other route is what I

mean when I talk about

knowledge

um because I usually use insight for

that but go ahead right and maybe that's

that's a better term for

it um because usually when I talk about

knowledge I mean something like a bridge

something like

um like a window almost like a

kaleidoscope

so to know a plant is multaneously to

know all plants because the plant

doesn't necessarily preed you so this

this also goes back to our discussion of

light so so you know we tend to think

perhaps that you know we walk on the

surface of the Earth and we encounter

beings and that our task in knowledge is

to record or retrieve all the predicates

of beings and then to tabulate them so

that we know what something is it has

certain parts it has certain attributes

but that's not really what I mean by

knowledge um to know something is to

complete it as you were

saying and in completing it to form a

bridge to other phenomena so it's it's

like a it's a more Dynamic process I

guess like knowledge is as dynamic as

the world of becoming itself it's not

like knowledge is this static you know

uh quest to tabulate what is or you know

being

to to affix the catalog of

identities yeah see that's the Trap see

that's the other route that I'm that I'm

talking about

yeah

yeah right yeah so when you complete a

being in knowing it you commune with it

it's a relation

so yeah to know a plant is to commune

with it and that communion is like love

it's it's tactile it's it's emotional

it's not it's not a matter of dissecting

or performing an autopsy on something or

stripping it down right right so we have

okay great so we have these two kinds

right and God is

saying God is essentially

[Music]

saying the death kind will compel your

people and you'll get trapped in it and

the the serpent is

saying you will experience understanding

and by each part you will better come to

understand the

whole right yeah I guess I'm both things

are true right if both things are true

certainly are people it's like the joke

it's like the joke that we were I was

laughing my ass off earlier when it said

um bonobos can detect when humans are

ignorant and respond to that and I was

like okay the bonovas are done with it's

over for them because if they can detect

human ignorance they be detecting

anything else there's not basically

nothing but human ignorance so once they

start detecting that it's over for

them so certainly you know our species

at at the at the group level

is unimaginably stupid I mean one could

never guess that it was even possible

for any being to be become as confused

as our species appears to be at the

group level it's inconceivable it's like

the that joke in um The Princess Bride

where the the Italian guy is trying to

poison dread pirate Roberts and

inconceivable you just never could

imagine

it and yet at the same time it's almost

like what do you pay attention to the

the map

the whole map which is mostly valleys

right a lot of ignorance or the to the

topological features of the map where

you see the mountains you're like oh my

God in the ignorance there are these

towering stars of insight and

unforgetting um both things are true

yeah right I'm saying you won't die

that's exactly what I'm

saying yeah

right yeah the way that you relate with

knowledge um see this is why it's very

easy for me to understand you when you

say this because you exemplify what you

speak of right you you enact what you're

speaking of this isn't you making words

about something that could exist or be

this is you describing just as I am

describing my experience for example of

toy maker you're describing your

experience of knowledge

it seems to me and I trust that I see

the the evidence of it in your in your

work in how you relate

with you're such an unusual cat it's

very I I'm so grateful to know you um

and and everyone here I mean but but

yeah I'm so grateful to know you because

you you demonstrate something that is

wildly uncommon among humans I have

known and it resembles it's really weird

resembles um like a metamorphic

development of the intelligence of the

child it's almost like you've

resurrected the intelligence of the

child in the domain of the

adult without being killed by

that which is you know right fairly

miraculous right that's that's a

straightup

miracle um you have you have

um you've enacted the potentials

of the Insight of the

child in the language of the adult which

is very similar like this is very

similar to what my own path is like we

don't do it the same way but we have

this um urgent uh motivation in common I

think what are your

thoughts oh I can see it

yeah yeah it's very beautiful this is

the promise of messianism as well right

what are you what are you saving people

from really what you're saving them from

is death of becoming

adults right right yeah you're

resurrecting the child the

Eternal child the intelligence of the

Eternal child within them which is

within all of

us yeah right you're resurrecting and

ennobling and

protecting and celebrating

that and it's a catastrophic reputation

of the Li

the LIE of the

grownups they groaning they're groaning

under the weight of the Trap they've

established and

become yeah do you have any other

thoughts on that

process that's interesting are you

kidding yeah I yeah I have other

thoughts on that process

um you know when toymaker was with

me it was

like being

reconceived

consciously being consciously

reconceived um and then

undergoing

embryogenesis inside

myself as an adult

male so effectively when when they when

you know we have this word born again

this

phrase that's what I experienced I was

reborn but it was like undergoing embryo

Genesis not undergoing exiting my

mother's womb that part happened at the

end right when toy maker left then it

was like being

re uh

birthed so yeah I think that

Resurrection has to do with like being

reconceived right not not being brought

from Death To Life almost like being

brought from

life into death

reconception and then reemergence from

that the sort of womb of origin rather

than the womb of my mother precisely yes

yeah yeah so what ordinarily takes place

in what you call knowledge is like

dreamless

sleep uh yeah maybe I don't know it's

akin to death it's it's akin to what you

were describing as death it's like the

process of slowly fossilizing in it's

it's um sclerotic right it's like um the

structure overtakes the beingness and

you got dead structure look at what

humans do right they love dead structure

they will gladly destroy everything and

Lead just dead structure there and one

of the ways they they they enshrine and

worship this dead structure is in the

objects that we call

machines right there's nothing alive in

a machine the function is the result of

having to kill

beings a a million times per second so

that this function in the machine

continues to operate it seems to me I

have a real heart on against machines

they seem like like little um meat

grinders for children of every possible

kind you just pour the children into the

meat grinder and you get oh I can

accelerate rate from 0 to 60 in 4.6

seconds you know whatever the [ __ ]

thing you get you know it's just dead

children in

there it seems to me I know this is very

um it's the

word it's one of my biases but yeah I

I'm not a fan of machines I don't like

dead structure I like living beings

right yep anything that costs children I

oppose

it that's a wrong price that's just no

nothing should cost

children yeah yeah the machine is um an

aema to this more luciferian

impulse that I think characterizes my

own being as you were

describing so the machine is at the

other end of the

spectrum yeah okay this is the other

thing yeah yeah well well go ahead wait

please continue I yeah give me more

um because dreamless sleep is a state

that contains the potential for

Resurrection

so yeah just like the machine so the

machine contains a Divine spark but it's

so heavily obscured and

opaque

um yeah no I think the machine is even

weirder than it's not just the

machine

Infiniti the absence of

being so that for each moment

it

functions less of being

exists yeah yeah that's what I mean yeah

that's that's a great way of saying it

it Infiniti the absence right now the

absence is a Cascade of re absenting

that doesn't

end that's absolute

Terror that's the worst imaginable

outcome of anything possible there's

nothing worse than

that hell is nothing more than having to

inhabit a

machine and the humans are like can I

upload my Consciousness oh God yeah like

are you out of your [ __ ] mind what

are you

thinking first of all what you think of

as your Consciousness is the least of

you it's like asking if you could become

one of your

toenails forever

and that's the most exciting thing you

can think yeah just preserve that that

little part of me that is all you know

[ __ ] and lying and separateness oh

yeah

great right well I mean Darkness and

Light though are are closer than I think

we ordinarily experience no no we agree

but there's something much but okay I'm

not talking about Darkness I'm talking

about hell yeah right I'm talking about

something that it's not exactly evil but

it it's it's that which must not not

be yeah

yeah so that's not Darkness or even evil

that's like the opposite of being and

what it looks like to me and this is why

I'm scared about knowledge and I like I

like having both Wings on this bird I I

like your wing of no knowledge for me is

this unraveling of

Lies um and bringing bringing forth uh

new insights and Truth

and knowing all things by better

understanding

something beautiful I love that that's

true but knowledge can also be the loss

of intimacy that comes with knowing

nothing other than the name of a thing

oh I know what that is that's a tomato

yes yeah no human has ever known what a

tomato is that word does not help you

right and if it blinds you it's you'd be

much better off without it so both

things are true yeah right so the sign

is like a dead thing but the machine is

like an animated dead thing like an

undead thing no the machine is a kilif

fire well like a it's a kill of fire

right right okay pilf no it's a verb

it's a verb of unbeing right it's an

active process of non of the

impossibility okay it it rips the

possibility ility of space the

possibility space of being to shreds and

then shreds those shreds further and

sucks the being out of them in my

view yeah if you could if you could

imagine that photons or electrons were

beings can you imagine what a torture it

would be to be part of a machine where

just have to do the same [ __ ] thing

over and over and over again in a trap

right you're torturing Angels basically

exactly yeah torturing Angels yeah

right no one would do no one would do

that what kind of idiot would it take to

do that you couldn't even it has to be a

nonbeing to do something like

that right

yes so that I guess that that form of

non-being is counter to the luciferic

impulse I guess that's what I'm saying

this this fossilizing process

or crystallizing

process and how do you see this

luciferic

impulse well

um if the

machine fossilizes and

extracts energy or

renders beings in nert basically it's

it's a certain form of time like it is

it dumps dead time into living

environments it's it's an entropy

generating it's like the opposite of a

black hole or something just it dumps

entropy it looks like to me it's an

entropy

dump in the in the sense that it it

pours death into transcendental living

systems please yeah continue right yeah

so its form of time is flattened whereas

my experience of time is much more

cyclical

or

um holographic in the sense of

perception so I mean it's just

Downstream from how I understand

perception

generally so yeah yeah so like when you

when you start contending with cuts or

with segments in time as you were

describing um this notion of linearity

arises and with that comes death like so

death itself is a function of cutting is

a function of segmentation is a function

of situating

to uh extremes at opposite poles but if

you recognize the presence

of the opposite

within the thesis or the antithesis

within the thesis you're much more close

to like my understanding of time and

that's that's the that's the sense of

Resurrection that's what Resurrection

for me would mean it would mean the

resuscitation or the uh rejuvenated

access to some kind of latent

possibility within the present so it's

not as if the present and the past and

the future are distinguished by distance

or some kind of abstract metric or um

interval it's that they're all present

here now so in the act of knowing you

form a bridge to other regions within

this kind of like cyclical oral

structure so you can access different

regions of of time itself because

because time and beings are one in the

same event it's not as though there are

beings in time or in space moving around

right yeah yeah no no no it's not yeah

to know a being is to know something

about time itself and it can serve as a

bridge to other beings and other forms

of time and so on so I guess that's what

I'm saying by resurrection and and

memory that's what I think that's what

goes on

and you liken that to the dreaming mind

and and and sleep and so on so if so if

the the if the if the state of dreamless

sleep contains this implicit seed or

this kernel of uh Luminosity then yeah I

think that's a much more General

phenomenon

and um you can see it in the evolution

of machines and and and living things I

think there's something there's

something analogous taking place in or

on Earth as what takes place in the

human mind it's like they're not they're

not different they're not

distinct Insight is a way of uniquely

undistinguishable

um set of of um phones comes from I

don't

know but

uh yeah Insight is is is like often for

me it's a way of

[Music]

undistinguishable ort of unstructured my

previous thoughts and

perspectives many of

which

were like that dead kind of knowledge

right like when I held the carcass of

that thing in my hand and how different

that was from when it was flying and I

was in awe and I was like can I get a

picture of this which is so weird

because there's a part of the

mind there's an aspect of Consciousness

and

awareness that thrives

on the capacity to grasp

identity now identity should be

ungraspable right it's impossible if I

am kissing you know I I like women so if

I am kissing a woman who I

love there is a kind of knowledge there

but it's it's

ecstatic it it

it leads Beyond any possibility of

grasping it's like I am falling into an

infinite um space and I am Rising above

all

structure this kissing thing it's

unbelievable how could something like

that even exist I don't know I don't

understand it but it's it's both

liberating and gravitic

for

me and

knowledge is much

more the kind that I'm concerned about

is much more like porn right it's not

like kissing at

all it's got the gravity but not the

ecstasis right the dead structure of I

know what that is see once I know what

something is the possibilities of

relating with it die into

that um

graspable uh

token right and of all the terrible

things in our human life that exemplify

this money is probably the worst of them

I don't know if it's money or guns or

porn maybe all three together are you

know

horrifyingly uh horrifying example

exemplars

of the process of taking the Divine the

possibility space of beings and just

collapsing it into a [ __ ] token and

then killing everything with it you

know um I don't know what what are your

thoughts yeah severing the cycle results

in death so when you when you transform

a cycle into array with infinite

extent you generate something like a

machine or something like a sign or a a

tokenized

word yeah once you sever the cycle and

and situate two

opposites at

odds you sort of set the stage for

extinction you set the stage for death

um and this infinitude that I think

you're describing

yeah it's really weird because you can

create a sort of a black hole that just

sucks the being out of

beings and turns that you could say it's

it's the soul right you could say it it

vampiric

absorbs

origin entering

being it vampiric inter it like gets in

Imagine something that interrupts the

lightning of origin coming into being

right it just puts a little shunt in

there and it shunts that off into the

producing structured objects and tokens

think of you know I don't know whatever

you like think of um one of my favorite

uh examples of this

is I don't know exactly the number of

packets of ketchup that humans produce

per hour but my guess would be something

like 12

million right and then it just imagine

that you just keep producing more

packets of ketchup each

hour which is what humans generally do

right they don't tend to produce less

and less of something once they start

producing something they just keep

making more and more and more of it they

get really excited about making more

things faster which means more dead

children per second in my view more dead

Minds more um

sclerotic uh agonized

um remains of what could have been

origin alive in being per second this is

what I think of photo RS as right they

weren't necessarily always that they

were always super

dangerous but now I think we produce

around um 340 billion of them per day or

something I mean just you know and

that's just still photographs right so

what you can see in that one actually

the photograph is probably the best

example it's even better than money um

because what you can see is like

eventually to keep those photographs as

electronic photographs in existence You

Must Destroy living beings so people

taking pictures of food eventually leads

to there's no food anymore we just have

photographs it's like a still birth it's

um abortion it is

it's Weir abortion yeah go ahead I'm

sorry it contains the impulse to

transcend history so it it contains this

kind of mystical Dimension but it's it's

not actualized in the right way

yes yes it's it's the wrong kind of

immortality exactly yeah it's the kind

of immortality that is death like it's

the

opposite of the possibility space of

existence expressed as a token that is

Immortal yes see yeah that's that's the

false path that's the wrong path oh god

oh oh yeah I love it oh beautiful

yeah yeah yes that's what it is when I

look out my window right now and I see

the

cars those cars appear to be

Eternal they shine with the

glow

of unchangeable

form Y and this is the promise of

machines and it's the opposite of the

promise of

being yeah right it's the internality of

the

structure empty of

being yeah the Allure of that

cleanliness that ahistoricity is a

mystical impulse that's what I'm saying

but it's actualized in the wrong way

[ __ ] oh my God this is this is the

[ __ ] like this is what we do right when

we get together it's

amazing I I love this um we make the the

context in which Insight can can arise

and then we craft it it's like it's like

uncaring we are uncaring our minds

together that's [ __ ] what I want to

do with my

mind I want to

[Music]

unstructural crazy listening to this

whole conversation while driving a car

for hours on

end

yeah yeah driving a car to pick up my

son you you you put me in a car you said

go go drive a car Nate and I'll talk

about how bad cars are the whole time

right yeah but you are such a beautiful

spirit that it's all it's it's all um

juice for

Liberation right it's all it's all

Liberation juice but no I'm I'm I am

seeing so beautifully together with all

of you you know and all the beings

remember like in the beginning of this

which not everyone was here for we had a

little invocation right where we we um I

mean I I do it but I think we all agree

where we remember all of the beings who

achd for um Beauty and the establishment

of intelligence and loving

kindness a generosity and wonder uh

resurrection and the Erasure of prisons

and cages on this world and on all

worlds and so when when you start out

with an invocation like that you're

going to have to work really hard to

[ __ ] that up see what I'm getting

like when we agree with their spirits

and their passions and their their

dreams and their suffering and what they

strove for when we enter into an

agreement with

that it's going to be hard to not be

beautiful

together it's going to be hard to not

honor the

nature of the Excellence of our our

actual nature and our potentials the

possibility space of not merely our

Humanity but um our beingness our

organismality or

animality um are the things that we

don't have words for and yet we are them

we can become them if we choose to

together anytime we choose to together

it just naturally occurs it's it does it

is very helpful if you have someone

in the

uh you

know this is awesome

wow it is very helpful if you have a

person or two in the in the

group who um is skillful and

practiced

um who's good at uh who's sort of a

space person right they they come from

outer space or they come from the origin

world and they've got that's the that

stuff is still sort of with them

right that's very helpful but it happens

almost instantly and

automatically if we just make this

agreement together I

think I

agree because the world the universe

wants this it doesn't want cars and

[ __ ] computers and [ __ ] it wants this

the

humans I don't know man something weird

draws

them when I asked toymaker about it he

was basically like okay look it's a

problem that happens when you get

representational cognition in an animal

that is supposed to have companion

intelligences and the companion

intelligences go away then that thing

just starts making objects that's

basically what he said the problem was

what you what are your

thoughts I mean that that statement

right there every time we come up to

this point the question is

always how do we get back to that

companionship well there's one thing I

don't know like my recent essays

um the umbilical disaster

and uh

organisms are a platform for the

embodiment of transphysical

intelligences or whatever the [ __ ]

ridiculous title was I'm embarrassed I

should have a three-word title not a 19w

title um but those explore the problem

um here's the

thing both toy maker and the second

thing that came they both basically had

one thing in common although toymaker

wasn't as

pushy which was they were like look dude

you become the radio

station we will gather people around you

and you will reestablish the

Uplink and in a non- pushy way that

wasn't terrifying with toymaker I

thought oh yeah that'd be

good um with the second thing that

happened in 2009 that was a little

pushier um and seemed very monofocal F

on this one thing and that scared me I

was scared of

that I don't know it's very complicated

I'm not sure for

example okay just like it's

important

for us to die into

Incarnation it might be important

for our

species I I don't like this idea at all

but I can understand that it could be

true it might be important for our

species to undergo the second

death

into the bad kind of knowledge in

machines to create the possibility of a

third kind of Resurrection or something

I don't [ __ ] know I don't know um

however

to more directly answer the

question so yeah I'm scared I'm scared I

think I could connect people to

non-human intelligences and I think

actually all that's that's the wrong way

of putting it you wouldn't have a mind

if toym maker wasn't with you there's no

way you could locally have a mind you're

just not aware you don't have conscious

interaction with that

thing and that

thing if you follow your mind Upstream

in the direction of its origin you will

encounter there's nothing else you could

possibly happen you will

encounter the intelligences that forged

the possibility of your

mind and that's so when you say that

when you say follow your mind Upstream I

don't even know how

to walk I don't even know how to move

Upstream yeah you

do and in fact um you've been doing that

with us here the difference is that what

we are

doing is what we are doing here is doing

that in the realm of thought

knowledge and the ideas about what our

humanity is that's what we are doing

here but you can do that and this is

look you do know what it is because you

you had problems I I think and you had

experiences when you were undergoing the

ordeal of um the

posa no yeah no that's true there there

to me I would describe it as a shedding

but I could see a different perspective

where it was also going

Upstream meditation is going Upstream um

true love actual love which is not

merely lust is going

Upstream um dreaming is going

Upstream oh so what if the what if we

combine these three things see I'm

asking you

to I'm not asking you to I'm saying that

it's possible to follow what you think

of as your Consciousness which you think

is in you you think it's yours that's

actually a lot of the problem right

there you think that this is your thing

this mind it's Nathan's mind I promise

you that is impossible not only is that

not the case there is no chance of that

ever occurring in anywhere no chance of

a separate mind no

chance so you are like the tip of one of

the Trees of Earth you're like the top

pointy point of one of the Trees of

Earth which are all one tree and are

connected to all trees in all of time

but you think no no I'm a separate

little

point right that

thought is the thing that

keeps it's both useful and a trap if you

can be free of it it's 10 times more

useful or a thousand times more useful

if you can't be free of it it's mostly a

trap so all I'm really asking you to do

is follow this thing you call or I'm I'm

not asking you I'm suggesting that it is

interesting and useful valuable and

beneficial to follow what you think of

as your

mind and I get what you're saying I

don't know how to even take one step is

I think what you

said all right so how could you take one

step all right so if you wanted to take

one step there's different ways to do

the one step

thing one of them is obviously

meditation so sit down pay very close

attention to your breathing and the

sensations of your

body release the

structure of the prison shape that your

mind normally

composes very

strenuously moment to

Moment release that more

with each

breath that will naturally result in

taking steps in the direction of the

origin of your mind which is not in your

body it's not on

Earth it's not in the

universe in fact what you will discover

eventually is that it is

not but what that word not means means

in this context

noot I mean one of the hilarious things

about this knot this

noot is if you make an acronym of it no

is the first word other is the second

word tree is the third word no other

tree that's a toy

maker Glimpse that's how toy maker would

show show me things he would show me

that inside our languages there are

these they're not fractals we need a

better word I need a better word I

should have made one why didn't I make

one okay it's not a fractal it's

[Music]

a

fral

pro

octal I don't

know see a the problem with a fractal is

that

um at every register of the fractal the

same structure is present and that looks

really trippy to humans but with what

nature does with the same principle is

something truly amazing and it's not

like a fractal it's the difference

between the three registers of the

universe your body and your

hand right there's a unique instancing

of the possibility space at every

register and with each unique instancing

you get not near not merely unique

structure you get unique

abilities affordances is the word that

the the extinction AI taught me who who

introduced that was it cornfed or or was

it George uh that was me yeah

affordances with with

nature um at each

register uh being right like the um

scope layer at each register of the

fractal there are unique

affordances uh Arthur Young in his book

The reflexive Universe talks about um

origin descending into matter in this

kind of vshape where you give up certain

degrees of Liberty on the way down in

order to gain new forms of Liberty on

the way back up this is a crucially

important um

feature of the future

give me some juice boys what's going on

in your

minds I think we just lost

Aon we lost him did he go I think he

just uh he just

left wow um how you doing

man I'm I'm pretty good I'm

uh it long story short I'm at an

inflection point in my life and

uh ready for what comes

next uh I don't know when you guys lost

me where did where did I where did I get

lost uh you wanted to hear the juice

yeah yeah give me the

juice hit it hit it George you it

Nathan well the machine is like the

after image of the Sun so if you glance

at the

sun you might see an after image that

Fades gradually that's knowledge that's

what I meant by knowledge and

organization and representational

cognition yes right yeah brilliant love

that go so in order to continue to

Incarnate the sun you need to continue

to look at the Sun

to generate these after

images and um yeah their dissolution is

totally entropic right so the machine

breaks down over time the machine needs

to be maintained and serviced by this

Perpetual frenzy of workers

right

um which I think is also anathema to the

dreaming mind

because yeah in the same way that the

sun is anathema to the dreaming mind the

machine is anathema to what I was

calling knowledge so you can you can

take knowledge in in in those two

directions

but from my perspective knowledge is

more

like the emission of photons by the eye

so I brought this up a long time ago but

if if the

machinic unconscious or the machinic

form of death is like the after image of

some

spot of light then

Insight would be the reappearance of

Light Within the living body so the eye

does this I think um perhaps even in in

sleep but also in

meditation so what can happen in the

course of meditation is that the body as

a transceiver begins to emit its own

input like a microphone period away I

[ __ ] love you oh my God just like a

microphone that gets carried away with

itself yes yes it's feedback but it's

not merely feedback go ahead yeah right

so that mode of feedback is what I was

describing as a bridge so you can use it

to travel between

different like even images or modes of

awareness um because once you realize

that the being itself is time as opposed

to being in time or moving through yes

yes the time

Dash

being yeah yeah then once you know one

being you can Traverse yes the totality

that's sort of what yes that's that's a

superpower right yes yes yes except

we've got it backwards the superpowers

are our actual

abilities and the features of our body's

capacities are the non-

abilities yeah yeah yeah

yeah I mean not to cast shade on the

physical but um we've just got this idea

of superior is backwards it's originary

not Superior go

ahead oh I see what you mean yeah yeah

so so the the physical body mutes or

limits information so it functions like

a filter but that filter can be tempered

in Awareness through feedback so

in the same way that a microphone might

filter certain input through feedback

you can amplify the signal so your body

can behave like an amplifier and that's

I think that's one of

the okay your mind though is the same

kind of thing and what we're doing what

knowledge does is it kills the feedback

that would become Cascades of insight

and the reason part of the reason it

does that is because Cascades of insight

are [ __ ] terrifying

you don't know what to

be not only do you not know what to do

when you experience Cascades of insight

you don't know what you

are you are deprived of the possibility

of knowing what you

are right I love that laughter

yeah as we said what a being is I think

is a matter of completing or a matter of

completeness so so the being doesn't

already exist in some complete State the

completeness of the being is something

that you supply in your relation to it

so so a living being is a is a similar

kind of cascade so what takes place in

the mind is really no different from

what takes place in the in the physical

world when you encounter a physical

being its own Cascade is tempered by

your filter so there's there's something

similar going on in the external world

as in the act of meditation so a tree is

a form of meditation it has a mental

Essence there's something tic about it

it's it's just like memory oh my God

yes except that it's

um okay it's stable

continuity is

deceptive

it's it's not there it's actually not

not

there it's not there nness takes on the

form

tree in the same way that that the not

their

nest of insects can take on the form

praying mantis in the same way that the

not there

nness of humans takes on the form

daring it's a transcendental ization of

of a kind of

absence yes yes you can see the link

there to the machine because the exact

opposite oh my [ __ ]

god holy

[ __ ] okay these are things which are

forbidden for Mortals to

say you're are not supposed to be able

to say such

things now we have we are we have like

gone

it's as if we we're going through the

layers of the atmosphere to reach outer

space right and then you get to the

layer just before [ __ ] hard

vacuum and then you emerge through that

layer into hard vacuum which of course

isn't vacuum at

all so

when Nathan was asking here's the really

weird thing that happened Nathan asked I

don't know how to take even one step in

that direction and then

you know from my perspective

anyway we started just walking in that

direction

together right now in language which is

supposed to be impossible and probably

is forbidden and you know then the

obvious question is well who who does

the forbidding I get it but

still yeah this is

insane the forms of the organisms

okay let me see if I can say back where

if I can recapitulate the transit and

help me out George the forms of the

beings and the organisms the plants the

insects the animals they are um like the

fingerprint the positive

fingerprint of a kind of absence of

transcendentality trans

ascending they are unique

modes

of

non-continuity expressed in the material

reflection in the water of matter in the

mirror water of materiality as

beings right

temporalized structured beings and

machines are the opposite of that in the

machine Ma you have death

transcendental as

function which infinitively consumes

being and makes death in an invisible

layer that we don't even see what are

your thoughts exactly yeah oh my God I'm

starting to feel like I'm in hman I

don't I don't know why I don't know why

the [ __ ] that would happen I want to be

more bald than I already am I want have

tattoos of Greek all over my body I

don't know why why why this is

confusing yeah I want to out almond

almond I think that's what's going

on do you have any

tattoos

zero do you have any tattoos

no Nathan any

tattoos nope but I've always thought

about getting one

yeah see that okay that's the difference

though right

like

stay

pregnant you're better off staying

pregnant with the

idea because see that's the

thing preserve the possibility

space rather

than I I this is my suggestion anyway

preserve the possibility space

um there's something metaphysically

weird about

tattoos

I I

don't it I'm not trying to say anything

about other people I find them

fascinating on other people they're

particularly weird on

women but they're also particularly

weird on

men uh

I am mistrustful of them

though well I mean could I like yeah you

can I I think they're they can be

incredibly beautiful like in terms of

Art and to actually carry art with you

uh on your skin is a cool idea but the

meaning that becomes ascribe to it sort

of like what we're talking about with

knowledge it's literally like

in in printing that sort of

uh whatever idea you're trying to convey

onto your skin to transmit that idea

until you know presumably you die or you

get it removed by a

laser I mean

um The Hope is a kind of a magical hope

isn't

it and if you have a magical hope

don't

settle for letters on pages don't settle

for letters on pages of of skin don't

settle for symbols don't settle for

symbols written on the surface of the

sun go to

being raw naked alive and say to being I

am a child of the earth and the

Stars allow me to drink from the Waters

of memory that I may take my

place in the library of the hearts of

the beautiful

beings don't settle for the token

Sarah

James

um I heard

her say something very

powerful because we we have heard we who

have read things and we who have heard

humans speaking we have heard that um

when you die there are uh challenges you

must face

right so one of the things that she said

and Sarah's a really brilliant spirit

and and heart I trust her I trust her

path I trust her

soul I would let her lead me I authorize

her right I totally authorize her um it

doesn't mean she's perfect it just means

that I think she's

good she has the fingerprint the scent

the fragrance of origin about her and it

wakes me up and makes me come to life

she was talking in an interview on third

eye

drops

um and she said one of the secret

things so for for people who will listen

to this and there will be people

listening to this soon I think not just

us and that's one of the things that

lifts us up to be able to see and and

talk and learn together much more

profoundly than we might if we were

having a merely private conversation

though even if we're having a private

conversation

um basically what happens is that you

get different lifting organs does that

make

sense yeah so Sarah says two things and

I I'll try not to paraphrase them so

that they're very clear when you die and

you become extremely

thirsty and you see I think she

said it's a big white bir

tree and

everyone is drinking

there and you're very very thirsty and

you see this big white birch tree do not

drink

there and then when you come to a little

stream you say and you are challenged at

the stream you are

challenged you say I am a child of the

earth and the starry heavens

permit me to

drink of the Waters of memory that I may

take my place among the

initiates these

are okay in the same way that you do

that you are not Lucid in most of your

dreams right these two um features

they may or may not refer to an

experience you could actually have they

probably do refer to an experience that

many actually have but they may or may

not that's not the important thing the

important thing is that you understand

the

principle the principle that they

encode and carry it with you because

that principle is the principle of

Lucidity it's the key to Lucidity Sarah

doesn't say this I am saying this

um if you try if you manage to do what I

have recommended and and I would like to

continue to do what I am recommending to

become what I am recommending that you

Traverse like the salmon chasing the

waterfall um it is impossible for the

salmon to swim up the waterfall it can't

be done there are zero fish who would

look at a waterfall and think I'm going

to swim up that waterfall

yeah get right up to the top of that

thing and I'm going to swim back to

where I was born that's what we have to

do in

Consciousness that is the

fundamental Mission I think once we

become incarnate now there are there are

um orbital missions right just like the

sun has different planets we have

different missions they're orbital

missions and one of them is to Simply

remind the humans of or

origin and to an to an amnes them to an

amnes them and to achieve anamnesis

together unforgetting together that is

fundamental this is what the children

are trying to get the adults to do when

they invite the adults to play but the

adults are so trapped in the black Iron

prison of representational cognition in

culturation and language that they the

mothers more the mothers much more are

are are um innately amenable to the

child's Messianic

resurrec uh

potency the fathers also can be it's not

that you know it's not like a gender

problem but the fathers are less

inclined to their their mode of being is

different

right um

and they AR is difficult for the for the

males to uh

submit to submit right because we males

we

are innately penetrative even me while I

am speaking of these matters right it's

very masculine the way that I'm speaking

if I were speaking femininely this would

be poetry and song and I would be making

music

instead of admitting you see how sharp

the words are they have these fricatives

and

um

[Music]

consonants in any

case there's there's there's a feature

of liquefication that is involved in all

of this right you have to lose your

structure if you want to walk toward the

origin of your mind

dissolve the rigid structure of your

ordinary waking consciousness if you

start to do that you will immediately

begin to experience

hypnogogic uh awareness right you will

enter the Lial space between the worlds

of life and death between the worlds of

wake and sleep between the worlds of

light and dark between the worlds of

matter and origin between the worlds of

knowledge and wonder

I mean for me if you want knowledge or

wonder well you got to have

both but if you ask me which I

prefer I like Wonder but don't give me

wonder without

knowledge

right give me some juice hit me come on

let's have some stuff yeah

hey did you have anything to

say nope I am a completely

blank

congratulations you made it beautiful oh

God no it's hilarious because um

this word

nope all of our words for that that are

words of negation do you know where I'm

going here George because if you do just

take over and fly with

it oh no I'm not sure ah you just said

no that was good bro you actually made

the negation

word

um I like to

think okay so I'm going to say a few

things that toy maker made very clear to

me in the hopes that it'll help everyone

here and anyone who's

listening

um you don't have to look for outside

beings or people or

knowledge

to

discover the path up the

waterfall but let me be really

clear no fish ever sat at the of

waterfall and thought I am going to swim

up that

[ __ ] fish swim up waterfalls

salmon are the only ones I know that do

it there may be others um I think

there's a word for this uh birth stream

seeking kind of fish I saw the word in

for the first time in the book The Dawn

of

everything um but what I'm going to try

to explain to you is that your own life

okay your conception your embryogenesis

your birth your

childhood each phase of your life was

recapitulating everything there ever was

it was recapitulating the birth of God

the birth of the

universe every feature of the birth and

development of human consciousness you

yourself have undergone there is no

other way to

exist you can't not do this and be so

when people say like they say things

that are

confusing and this goes back to the

question of you know I don't know how to

take the first

step um you your own you

must an amnes your own

history and amnes unforget your own

history and you will discover in that

history the answer to

everything everything not the answer the

nature the origin the purpose the

meaning the spirit the

Adoration the

freedom the transcend the transc

sentients you are those

things it's as if you're looking out the

wrong

end of uh of a seeing device right

instead of oh God when George earlier

was talking about

um the

feedback uh which is of course dreaming

and insight is a certain kind of this

similar feedback that can happen while

we're awake Lucidity right

waking I want and we have here I have

experienced here today um with with you

all uh Lucid

waking right which is this kind of Anam

noetic

unforgetting

Revelation so each of us undergoes that

story in Genesis that's something you

undergo right you

are the before of Adam and Eve you

become Adam and Eve

God tells you don't eat right you go

through all these things in fact one of

the most important things the Bible can

be understood as particularly the Torah

the fact that the Bible exists is enough

justification to take

it um passionately not seriously

passionately um and if you're really

curious and you and you explore the

Bible with

curiosity you know go ahead repudiate

the hell out of it if you're you know if

you're somebody like almond perhaps go

ahead see how that goes that might turn

out to be powerful I don't know but I

tend to prefer the other path right I

prefer the path

of

um find the seeds of insight hidden with

in I also like the path of Expos the LIE

right so we got this path of find the

seeds of insight hidden within Coca-Cola

and Pepsi and then I also really like um

[ __ ] that [ __ ] [ __ ] Coca-Cola that's

just a bunch of sugar poison right I

like both I like both signs I want both

Wings knowledge as the death of the

possibility of insight and relation and

knowledge as the

unwrapping of in in awareness and

consciousness of the nature of being an

identity and meaning

okay where am I going here

so there's a sort of personal archor

graphic travel that you can do which is

what I mean in part it's it's one way of

taking what I mean when I say swim up

that

waterfall that is your mind's origin

moment to moment your mind does not

exist it is not a state it is not a

thing it is not a static it a

relationship that you're having with

something and if someone says what what

is that thing I'll be like why are you

talking like that no I would say um one

way to call that thing is the

logos it is the

being that is not I'm gonna make a

double negative here it is the being

that is not not

time it is the being that is not not not

light it is the being that is not not

space it is the being that is not not

being and that being is the possibility

of

mind and all minds are an instance like

the organisms

are at least down here of the absence a

unique mode of presencing the absence of

transsentient

I know I'm using negatives

weirdly but this this negation thing

okay so yeah now I see where I was going

I've made a huge circle I didn't mean to

make this big of a circle but I'll I'll

go with it anyway so

um I have a

sister and when we were little to hear

my mom tell

it

um my mom my mother who was very like

with us all the time

she she carefully recorded the first

words of me and my

sister and I spoke before my sister

because I was

firstborn and my first words that my

mother told me which I think are really

profound and

masculine were I go I go this what I

said I go this is like the sun right

it's a masculine thing I

go my sister's first

words

were

no so you can see these two principles

and when I say our lives and our our

histories

um our inactions of the entire history

of the universe you can see that in the

first words of me and my sister

right the masculine principle I go I I I

do and The Feminine principle of

negation

no men will do every [ __ ] thing women

know what not what should not be done

well men know some of what should not be

done but negation is very profound and

when you when you hear stories about

Enlightenment and so on you almost

always

hear that it is rarely compared to

isness it is almost always compared to

not

this no other

tree give me something let's go what's

left yeah the Greek concept of Truth as

Altha meant something like

unconcealment so

yes so truth was more like a process of

removing a veil than a predicate of

something and I think we just lost Daron

again oh there we

go

so

althia unconcealment then you said so

and then I disappeared

um so yeah the Greek concept of

Truth was more like a

process that removed a veil than a

predicate of

something yes so you know as opposed to

falsehood being the opposite of

Truth what I think made truth possible

for the ancient Greeks was the extent to

which the body behaves like a

filter so the body itself is the

possibility of

concealment and so then what appears in

space or what appears in the image of

the external world is like a series of

veils that

interpenetrate so space is a layered

structure consisting of interwoven

temporal rhythms or

regimes uh

orchestrations yeah like a melody um

orchestrations yes which is a Mel

mediated by the body so the body is like

what makes concealment possible so in

order to arrive at truth or a truer

image one needed to transcend the body

to some extent or modulate it so

basically to um interact with its

feedback um with its environment yes yes

okay here's the thing it's the

feedback that is the

mystery it's the feed back that produces

lucid dreaming right it's the

feedback that people uh

Chase in

orgasm it's the feedback they like in

intoxication it's the feedback that

becomes medicine for

healing it's the

feedback now I when I keep saying this

one word I'm I'm I'm killing it I'm

I'm not doing the right

thing the filter has another property it

has another

veilance and the veilance is

[Music]

to when it filters its own

filtration and that

produces various

modes of this stuff that we call

feedback Lucidity is a kind of

feedback um you're right the Greeks knew

that the body was a problem you would

never perceive the truth because the

nature of the body's filters would

deceive you something like

this not the Greeks some Greeks who

thought about these things go

ahead yeah but unconcealment is also

more than just removing a veil like a

blanket um in the same way that

filtration is more than just you know

this unidirectional flow from the

outside to the inside as it was for

dayart yes because um now you have will

purpose

imagination um intent right what is your

intent yeah yeah so the process of

authorization that you were describing

is a kind of

filter it is it's one that usually

remains

unconscious if we pay if we shine light

on that in Consciousness very strange

things start to happen that will produce

various kinds of feedback go

ahead right and so the Cycles in time

that that that we can perceive in you

know the external world are like a

series of veils that issue from what the

body itself is but the body is more than

just what appears in space so you know

if you were to look down at your body

what appears in space is is already

filtered right so it's not as if this

this you know this skin is like

generating an image see that's that's

the mistake of modern Neuroscience in in

imagining that the brain or the body is

somehow generating an image that's not

what happens right yeah no it's a

reductive materialist eliminative

materialist fantasy yeah right it's that

the body itself is already an image is

already tempered by this deeper process

it couldn't exist there'd be nothing

there without the

image idos in Greek e EI d o s yes right

right

idolon idolon it's a mistake to

privilege one image over others and to

claim that one image is the cause of

others it's rather

that it's rather that the the totality

of the image so multiple domains

multiple beings coar

by virtue of the same process so yes it

isn't as if matter is causing living

things to exist or that matter is

causing a living being to to exhibit a

certain feature it's rather that they

both reflect the same underlying process

so they can be used as bridges that

which causes matter causes

beings sorry what's that that which

causes matter causes beings yes

precisely yeah so they both exhibit the

same kind of

overtone uh series or structure exactly

like a harmonic yeah like a harmonic

right so the image of the external world

is a kind of harmonic it's a kind of um

holistic image so so the image as a

whole has certain Properties or certain

features that make it look law governed

or law abiding it has a certain reason

but the freedom from the law resembles

the fre freedom from the

body exactly yeah so once grant that

grants insight and

understanding right understanding

awareness Insight yeah so the the

physical image contains this latent

potential which can be actualized

through feedback so through feedback

more of the image can be revealed that's

that's what I think the Greeks were

talking actually more of the image

arises it's not just revealed well yeah

it arises in the same sense as the

complet that we were discussing earlier

yeah yeah but okay so what you're saying

is the

unveiling you're placing the emphasis on

the unveiling which is different from

the

arising there are two

competing um Idol Longs here one is that

the nature of being

is unveiled to us so it is

remembered and the other is that it is

being completed by us it we are we cause

it to rise by interacting with it you

follow well the

completeness I think

is is the same process as the memory so

the redintegration the um who wait wait

wait the

integration yeah the reconstitution of

the being is something that you supply

through knowing it or through

interacting with it but it's a form of

memory in the same way that

um in the same way that remembering a

fragment of

some

Melody um Can can reinstantiate the

entire Melody so if if you access one

portion of the melody you can

reintegrate the totality and that's I

think what takes place in encountering

beings in the external World in

resurrecting them or in remembering them

you complete them at the same

time but their completion is also a

function of your own filter so it's not

as if they exist they don't like pre

they don't pre-exist you right

right they're incomplete before you

before you encounter them [ __ ]

god did I did you invoke me or did I

invoke

you because this is absurd dude this is

rid you're not supposed to do this see

am I giv am I giving you like a

forbidden fruit here is this yeah yeah

this is not this is not supposed to be

able to happen down here you do

understand that right you do you have

the same sense of that impossibility

that we are transgressing

together no I don't really feel like I'm

breaking the

law well I do I mean I'm not breaking

the law it's like

um I've I've never participated in

conversations like this one the

closest the the conversations with toy

maker are transcendental to this one but

this has the stink of the same kind of

progress to me um all right so I don't

want to lose the thread by celebrating

it which is one of the weird ironies of

being a human

being um it's a bit like taking a

photograph of

something

okay so there's this idea that I know

who Nathan

is um because I know his name and I know

I can imagine something resembling what

he looks like he's this sort of

towheaded um half Angelic half awkward

sort of guy young guy that I

know and one of the amazing things about

Nathan that I think is truly beautiful

is that it's very clear that he doesn't

merely know what to do he's discovering

what to do as he plays in the

possibility space of his of his moment

and his relationships with others and

being a human and being Nathan and all

these things and that's really amazing

and there's a conflict in him between

the status

uh Nathan esque known

Nathan and there's a conflict between

that and the representational layer of

human existence modernity culture

technology systems structure roads cars

[ __ ] rent paying job thing [ __ ]

right and there's a conflict between

that and his

interiority um we all inherit that

conflict you know within the Bible

they're like this sins of your fathers

will be visited under the that what the

actual sin is is just representational

cognition be clear right it wasn't like

they did a really bad thing or they like

decided that we're going to go into

matter and become material beings that

wasn't the Sin Sin was like we will play

with tokens instead of being together

with each other right we will tokenize

relationships and thoughts and things

but that that sin is also important it's

it's sort of like the first Angel you

can't get you got to have that um so one

of the things I was I was that's so

amazing to me is that we resurrect each

other when we engage in behaviors like

those with wi in which we are engaged

right now we bring each other into the

possibility space of Consciousness

awareness thought understanding Insight

intelligence Wonder

awe um and amnis we bring each other

into this space I need you to carry me

in return I will carry you and we will

unforget together and we

will We produce a kind of a feedback

effect with our minds right I give you

some juice it explodes in you you give

me the result of that explosion it

explodes in me and we keep going that's

how you get back up the waterfall what

are your thoughts

I mean that

completely um obviates the concept of an

existing static Darren exactly an

existing static George right we bring

each other into existence or we bring

each other into structured

death right yeah so you inform an aspect

of my own identity which is very

real but that aspect of my ident

identity is your reconstruction so

memory is more than just retrieving

something that once existed memory is a

creative act so you create you co-create

an aspect of my own identity when you

interact with oh yes right

manimo is the goddess I will adore

manimo right she who is

memory without her

nothing yes yes and this this relates

back to what Nate was saying earlier or

someone I think it was

Nate um yeah my identity isn't actually

mine not mine to protect right right no

the this is the thing right if I want to

be the fingernail of Darren then I'll

just [ __ ] Darren eyes and I'll be

like you know Darren's the greatest

thing ever you should really love he's

amazing aming bro Darren is the good

[ __ ] right and on and on and on the more

that I do that the more that I'm dead

inside it's not that ego is bad you need

to have fingernails right I don't want

my fingernails to go away but I also

don't want to be like the fingernail on

the end of my pinky that's too um

limited a scope for my

being and also that if I become that

flat and hardened and

angular um

almost all of my capacities for new

degrees new new ways of um new degrees

of Liberty right new ways of being a

being will disappear U they will

disappear into into structure right

repetition it's a

symphonic situation it's without the

body you can't synchronize the multip

of

principles but the fact of the body can

trap you in the appearance of

repetition can trap you in the sense of

repetitive um

consistencies what do you

think yeah I think the same process also

occurs in the natural world if you look

at the evolution of Life as a whole so

the individual the seemingly individual

human

being in its identity or in its

ego is like a condensed version of what

took place on Earth

yes it's the

um when when you hear this in like uh

the Emerald Tablet right as above so

below as within so without

what you're what what's actually being

said is weirder than that what they're

saying is there are no

forms that are not the unforgetting of

origin in

structure yeah because Darwinism posits

that an individual being is the object

of selection or a certain pH no chance

of that being true yeah yeah though you

can slice the manifold in such a way

that that becomes the most obvious

feature of biological reality you can

slice the manifold that way that's a way

of cutting yes yes yes go ahead yeah the

identity of the organism is also

co-created by its environment in the

same way that you co-create my my

identity it's the exact same process yes

yes see this is why you can do these

things alone because all of the beings

are in you but when we come together in

the way that we do

here

um like both things work you can

anamnese in

isolation you can joyfully anamnese in

isolation that's possible it's probably

more challenging it seems much more fun

and interesting to do it with brilliant

inspired you know playful other

beings um the tree is such a being any

tree is such a being but but

here it's really funny we are I think we

are doing what the Greeks would be very

proud of Socrates I think would be like

crying with joy in his grave to hear a

conversation like

this um this is so

rare that the humans get to do this that

they do it in any way that sustains

itself

it's very precious this kind of this

kind of um medicine that we can become

together right and I think uh it's

different you know like when Nate says I

don't know how to take the first step

okay

uh yet there's a difference

between um giving humans instructions

and becoming the way

together with and for each

other right I mean it resembles the

salmon at the bottom of the

waterfall yes asking itself I don't know

how to take the First Leap right yes

also something that most people will not

really understand that the salmon

naturally understand it's very profound

um is that we think of individual

salmon swimming

up a

waterfall but I'm pretty sure that what

happens is that many of the

salmon some of those salmon that reach

the base of the waterfall they come from

the same

mother right those mothers don't have

one or two

children they have 700

children

follow yes so when they when they're

collecting back at the base of the

waterfall what's happening is like the

the

manimo the memory of the mother is

materializing at the base of the of the

waterfall and the spirit of the father

who goes I go right he is materializing

in the between of them and they

draft

together right multiple children of

multiple mothers materializing at the

base of the waterfall they come from the

same stream they come from the same year

of the same time stream

they come to the base of this waterfall

it's not just the waterfall that is the

[ __ ] problem there are grizzly

bears up there at the top that want

salmon

brains they want to eat some salmon

brain they mostly throw the fish away

from what I understand they don't eat

the salmon they want the brain just chw

they just Chomp the brain taste that

brain and throw the fish away and grab

another

one so there's lots of um weird

challenges to get back to the birthplace

the origin place

um what a shockingly brilliant metaphor

and nature like if you see if you see a

situation like this in nature it has

10,000 meanings not one we're using we

are making expedient use of one of the

meanings of this

figure that we see in the salmon um

swimming up the waterfall which I love I

I think it's

amazing um I love the salmon I love the

living beings the living beings are the

embodied transcendental Spirit of origin

alive with eyes

and they are delicate right they can

suffer if you're not embodied it's

pretty hard to suffer I think though we

have you know models of disembodied

suffering in hell and so forth right

I don't know I don't know about

that I suppose it's I

mean okay let's just say then that the

forms of

suff

very uh

charged right to be embodied it's a

different kind of suffering if you are

injured or sick or lost or alone or

deprived or you know you can't something

bad is happening to your body it's very

it's uh tangible it's very

tangible I love the living

beings absolutely without any like um

unconditional Adoration of living beings

unconditional adoration

they are heroic and they are doing I

know this is going to sound weird but

I'm I'm basically

certain that even uh when they are

confused like our kind of beings are

which I think is a really weird problem

why are the humans so

stupid

um they are doing something that that is

invisible that is uh beautiful and

nourishes the origin

World it enriches the origin world but

there is a very bad there seems to be a

very bad problem with with our kind of

our kind of being with human beings

and damn I'm losing a thread that I'm

trying to find

here

problem

humans they ignorance

I don't know it's very

weird can't find the thread it

disappeared as I was trying to grasp

it

typical yeah maybe it needs more time to

incubate no I had it it's a hippocampus

thing my

hippocampus powered down

briefly the threat I was chasing

dissolved

um

wow what an amazing path we've woven

here

Perhaps it is a good

time for us to wind

up how are you feeling

George yeah I think we're over four

hours now just

about

okay yeah I I can't even express my

gratitude for this um this is

just I mean it's like the nectar of

being

alive dripping into to a graveyard of my

ordinary

life wow I'm glad to hear

that I hope it's somewhat you know I I

hope that resonates with you as well

yeah yeah it's my lifeline right

on yeah I'm just so grateful um not just

for those who were here today and you

and

Nate uh but those who gave birth to this

you know I can't

imagine what Hugh would make of this

conversation I have no

idea uh

right I I I think he would I don't know

like this is the opposite though of Doom

singing and that's what I really love I

don't Doom singing doesn't help the

humans right it doesn't help anyone it's

not clear at all like the bad bad bad

bad thing it's part it's a it's an

ingredient in the soup that we make and

eat together here but that thing that's

just um it's really toxic if that's the

the main ingredient right well the point

of

dorismar early that's the idea die early

yeah die now up hope right that's yeah

give it up right it I see it's a sort of

Black Sabbath thing

it's like salt

soup right yes just suck all the

moisture out of me right now

desiccate if you give up then maybe you

have a chance I mean I think that's the

idea then you'll I know I like our

flavor much better it's inspired and

inspiring and and amniotic and it sings

the Praises of many beings who have

striven for Beauty

and

um not it's more ripe it's it's more

mature it's more yeah yeah it's fruity

it's fruity and fragrant juicy and

nectarous well I will go from this to

meditation and then to

lunch yeah I'm so grateful for all of

the beings who gave us this chance to

exist now who suffered and

strove sometimes fought sometimes

died who spoke and who were

silent who sang and who

cried all of the many beings I adore

them I remember them I love them they

are my family you are my family

yeah so grateful
