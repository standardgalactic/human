Hello, everybody. Here in one of my favorite local places, San Francisco
Botanical Gardens. I'm always inadvertently advertising for them.
Welcome to my bald forehead and my weird, you know, marmot branded walkabout. I am
on fire today in the sense of being both nervous and enthusiastic about today's
topics. And part of, I'm gonna place some of the responsibility for this
conflagration at the feet of Eric Weinstein and Anna Hakian, if I have her
last name, even partly correct. I listened to 96% of Eric's portal podcast with her.
It's really fun to listen to these two people conspire together, to unveil
something resembling playfully composed intelligence and insight and urgency
and disambiguation. And their disambiguations are never complete. This
is a really important feature, right? They don't take you down to the concrete
fact. And part of the reason they don't do that, there's lots of reasons, but one
of them is they're sophisticated enough cognitively, creatively, intellectually,
humanly, organismally to know that manifolds, right, complex arrangements of
fields and layers and, you know, topologies can't be disambiguated down
to a unit, right? You can't generalize your way out of a crisis that's
incredibly complex by its nature, in which billions of diverse humans and
bizarre non-human groups and profiteers and pirates and victims and rapists and
murderers and students and millennials and Gen Xers and octogenarians and fucking
everyone you can possibly imagine and 12,000 categories you'll never dream up.
You can't make a prescription for something this complex and have any kind of
faith in it. What you can do is establish sort of anchors around which you
orient here and then you can test those over time and determine like was that an
intelligent move? Do I need to modulate the perspective that generated that
prescription or concern or motivation, right? You can do, you can assemble a
vehicle, piecemeal, whose fundamental constituents you have relative confidence
in at the moment. One of the things Eric said that I thought was astounding and
so unusual when they were talking about religion and belief is, you know, if you
ask him, what does he believe, he'll ask you at what time of day. And he'll say,
you know, I'm kind of grounded in atheism but there's all these foxholes and
there's no atheists in a foxhole and maybe there's this kind of chomsky-esque
genetic imperative for humans to believe in upscale intelligences.
It's not really chomsky-esque even though he might argue something similar
for language use. By the way, I just have to pause here for this.
This crazy beautiful passion vine, excuse me,
Hasiflora membranesia, right, makes stuff like this and little fruits and
things, passion fruits. So, you know, the reason Chomsky's name gets in there is
because he's one of the theorists who, whose claims became popular enough for
people to be aware of them, some people, particularly academics, that there's an
implicit sort of linguistic instinct kind of built in even though organisms
aren't built and they're not machines. There's this kind of thing built into us
evolutionarily and that's why children acquire language so with such great
facility in their early infancy and also why, according, you know, to the theory,
it can be really difficult, if not impossible, to teach people language
after the uptake period has passed. And this is a really interesting
generalizable analogy, right? There's some things you can, you're
likely to be able to teach people during certain life phases and in other
life phases you're going to have either no luck or a really difficult job ahead
of you to transform their motivations and perspectives and ideologies and
beliefs. In any case, when asked about belief in God, he's very with
astonishing insight into his own honest humanity. He said, you know, I'm an
atheist most of the time, but there's times a day you can ask me and I'll, I
might change my perspective, you know. Most of us seem to think we're supposed to
have one belief all the time and if we were in, you know, a mechanical, purely
mechanical predictable context, which there's nothing like that on earth,
except maybe even, even in a machine, I'm not sure that that's real, then that
perspective might, you know, the perspective that you're supposed to have
one belief, one position, cling to it at all costs, fight off all, all comers,
could maybe fly, but it won't, it doesn't. It's a kind of
pervasive ignorance that's in our modern time. I can't really speak for
historical times I didn't grow up in or didn't have a mind or grew up in, but
didn't have a sophisticated enough awareness to reasonably disambiguate. I
can't speak for those, but I can speak for, say, the past 30 years of my life or
something like this. Yeah, I can reasonably speak about the late 80s
through now. At least I have some degree of trust in my capacity to do so. And
another thing that sort of marks out people like Anna and Eric as different
from the common people that we're inclined to encounter or become is that
they're aware of, like, transformation of play, of degrees, of an evolving
relationship in which there are meaningful roles and identities and
costumes we can wear for purposes that actually work out well either in the
relationship or pragmatically, or both, hopefully. And unfortunately the common
people are not sophisticated enough to understand things like gradients, right?
It's not whether it's true or false, it's to what degree is it true and what
else. What other information do we need to include and remain aware of in order
to be able to navigate reliably in a decision-making context, right? Where we
have to make decisions. And by the way, every time you open your mouth or don't,
you're making a decision. So you're having to do some kind of evaluative,
you know, underground, sometimes above ground, other times, behavior that
induces you to believe, right, to be motivated to make face noises, or to
write, or to respond to something that you've encountered, which unfortunately
for many of us these days often means a media object. It's unfortunate that we've
become, actually it's bizarre, and it's like we're living in a comic book because
humans are responding to media objects as if they were people. And humans are
condensing down, they're collapsing into these positional roles that might as
well be media objects, right? They are depersonated, they're uninhabitable,
these positions. They are explicit instances of various species of what
Eric, this is a computer analogy I like. What he refers to is malware. And most
of what's being exchanged in the public with some wonderful exceptions, Eric's
podcast among them, and is probably among them. Many of the people he respects
and names are among them. Most of what's being exchanged is malware, and people
are identifying with their pet disease, cognitively, intellectually. They're
identifying with a contagious form of disability, partly because they're
frightened, and partly because they were never exposed to and rewarded for
taking up the tools that would both give them defenses against malware, right?
And encourage them to formulate and express intelligence that builds malware
resistance in their cohort populations and in populations extending outward
from that. Nearly none of us have the tools to do that, but there are some who
do. Perhaps I somehow naively believe they are my people, but in any case let
me say that I can trustworthily claim to aspire to membership in that
clade, in those clades. Fundamental issues like one versus many, a perspective
versus a fact, intelligent analysis of a situation versus an answer, intelligent
analysis keeps opposing its own findings and keeps folding new data and
perspectives in. That's an active process. It's not something you arrive at and go,
I've got the truth. It's all a hoax. It's a big conspiracy. The problem is that in a
way, in a number of ways, depending on the angle we're approaching from,
statements like that are reliable. Just about everything is a hoax. There's
a seething, bubbling, fucking river lethay underneath our culture that is
almost pure disease and it's conspiratorial. But not usually in the ways that
common people are inclined to derive from their pet perspectives, originating
in media exposure. The people who have good perspectives are people who know
how to build a vehicle, a ship, and how to orient that ship in wildly
unpredictable, unprecedented, confusing, high noise floor situations like those
we are going to be facing for the rest of our natural human lives come now. Why
do I say that? First of all, everything that we came to think and believe, and
there are a few exceptions, you know, there's some trustworthy ground out
there somewhere, but I'm just going to be a little bit, I'm going to violate my
own guideline for a moment and say, yeah, that whole fucking understructure of
modern civilization is a complexly layered, tangled, matted, grotesque,
putrid, sort of blanket of fundamentally toxic lies that are perpetuated for
ideals such as convenience and to perpetuate the dominance of phony
people, non-people, and organizations and institutions over the common populace,
right, from childhood to the grave and if possible beyond, and if possible before.
So now we're in a situation where things have gotten even weirder and I want to,
I'm going to make an analogy. Imagine with me that in a very tall, multi-story
modern building, which we'll call the edifice of knowledge and civilization,
terrorists have set up bombs on every floor to pinch blow the girders that
hold that floor up and they've timed the explosion to coincide or follow
shortly thereafter the impact of a large passenger jet into that building.
Okay, where we are right now is in the moment when the passenger jet is
hitting that building. The charges are in place, some floors are already
collapsing ahead of schedule, the whole fucking edifice is about to go to fucking,
it's gonna collapse into its own footprint, much like we saw, I'm not
making the claim that that's what happened on 9-11, I'm saying that it's
pretty difficult to disambiguate that fucking mess in any way that convinces
me, oh no it's just, it's merely the result of aircraft crashing into a
building. In fact, that kind of monodimensional causality is anathema to
anything resembling understanding. Now that doesn't entitle us to go inventing
and promulgating wild conspiracy theories, though you know most of us are
free to do that if we feel that it's a good idea or important or we have some
agenda that encourages us to do so. The building is about to enter freefall,
all the fictions and bullshit and institutions on which modern civilization
were founded and have long been operating are about to fail in the sense
that they will no longer lead our perceptive faculties, we're about to
escape that gravity due to crisis and not one crisis but a long cascade of
crises which have been in the mail for the last hundred years minimum and are
now going to start arriving in personal and communal and situational and social
mailboxes on mass every day all day probably for the foreseeable and
unforeseeable and maybe to hopefully framed future since there might not be
one and for a lot of us there won't be for a lot of us you know ordinary people
and for a lot of you know entitled wealthy domineering pirates and everybody
is going to be death all over the place and us moderns have never seen that we
didn't fight World War two or World War one we've never seen bodies on the
battlefields most of us though some people in the military have in relatively
limited theaters so that collapse is in process and while it's in process what
remains of the integrity of our capacities for human liberty novelty
innovation creativity play eros seduction meaningful vocation role
accrual role embodiment life paths homes families all these things those things
are hanging by a tiny thread right now and there are 12,000 factions eagerly
sawing away at that thread so that they can capture the reactive potential of
cohorts that have been turned into victim you know outraged victim reactors
and even the people who are being honest are lying because they don't have in
with such a high noise floor by meaning by which I mean with so much noise and
confusion and unreliable but very compelling information we're in an
info war situation right now we have been for the past you know long time
right as as others will point out this isn't the first time no I agree they
could say it's always been like that and I would agree except that the fact that
you had a few cancerous cells in your body is totally different from you've
now developed tumors in five of your organs that are inoperable and that's
the situation with civilization at the moment so the fact that yeah you know
this it's always been kind of an info war context for human beings is trivial
compared to the fact that right now in that theater atomic bombs are going off
moment by moment and the common people because these aren't physical explosions
are completely unequipped to understand or relate or deal with this and they're
madly factinating under the pressure and it's like somebody it's like it's
mating day at a giant ant colony and someone has just driven a shovel into
the entrance from which the queen and the mating males are awaiting emergence
and they've turned it over and now the ants are just going apeshit in frenzy
it's similar to if you know murder hornets attacked a beehive it's similar to
if one of the predators that is common or one of the sort of one of the species
that eats termites has just assaulted a termite mound and broken it in half
right the termites are in a mad scramble to both defend the hive as they
understood it a moment ago identify the interloper repulse them rebuild except
in this case there's ten thousand different interlopers so the humans are
not going to disambiguate that let's just agree it's not going to happen there
are no organs in place in our society or culture none zero with the capacity to
do this because we never formed them and one of Eric's arguments which I agree
with is we should form them right now we should find the people who really we
can trust we have reliable intelligence who can argue with each other who can
change their positions who are experts in their fields or our prodigies right our
wild type prodigies like Anna I think is and we should give them fuck you money a
lot of it right now and put them in like a quarantine you know home where they
can work together the same way we did when the United States was attempting to
assemble the atomic bomb except we need to assemble the opposite of a bomb we
need to assemble actual intelligence that unifies human beings in the clear
and presently obvious fact that our histories futures survival hopes
liberty intelligence creativity mating potential all these things are currently
completely
they're being dissected and their organs are being sold on the black market this
is essentially what's going on and so we need to assemble the opposite of a bomb
right we need something that draws humans together and unifies them in noble
trustworthy reliable common concern roles you know role acquisition and
enactment organizational and individual behavior vocations we need to anyone who
thinks there's something we're gonna like go back there's there are people I
know and even in my family who think well let's just go back to how it was
before there the before is gone that shit was obliterated COVID-19 is an
entirely new situation for human beings and whether it was intentionally
produced by human beings or it was the the accidental sequelae of our un
imaginably deep environmental misbehavior over the past thousand years
but particularly the past 80 doesn't matter it doesn't fucking matter the
only way that might matter is if in the former case if it was an intentional
act we would have to presume that the perpetrators are in possession of
absolutely crucial intelligence that might help stem the very sophisticated
and still mysterious consequences of worldwide contagion pandemic in that
case we could you know if we could be certain that we knew that it was an
intentional design of some people those people probably have things like
antidotes and vaccines waiting on the shelf otherwise they wouldn't act because
it'd be like well otherwise they probably wouldn't act because you don't
want to infect yourself and your children with something you can't treat
right however looking back to the Manhattan Project we can just
intelligently realize that before the United States dropped a pair of atomic
bombs on Japan we dropped a pair of atomic bombs on our own people first we
did that first and there was no protection from atomic war back then
the only protection was this kind of mutually assured destruction thing where
if you bomb us we'll bomb our before we die we'll bomb you right and that is the
the idea that was the idea of that was the idea of the shield now anyone who
would believe in that as a shield is an idiot in my view and you can claim it
worked I'll claim that's not what worked other things worked that is that is not
what worked but in any case my point is simply that most likely if the pandemic
wasn't intentionally ceded act and I'm gonna go on record here as as predicting
that we will discover the existence of the virus we presently have good reason
to believe is responsible for the outbreak we're going to discover that
that thing was circulating way pre 2019 end of 2019 maybe as early as 2017 but
almost certainly as early as 2018 which you know doesn't put China off the map
as a possible bad actor but I'd be skeptical I'm skeptical of intentional
Chinese involvement in the pandemic and I'd be more likely I don't I don't even
really want to speculate about who's the probable perpetrator here it's not
important to my discussion what it what what is important to my discussion is
that
we common people are not equipped to effectively or intelligently disambiguate
the information we are commonly exposed to by by media and the peers or excuse me
by the media and our peers in fact we need help doing this we need expert help
and statistics themselves will not tell the tale statistics are fudgeable and
they never catch up to the phenomenon they never catch up to any complex
natural phenomenon that they are derived to frame for us they don't tell us what
stuff is or does they just they give us a kind of a a foothold where it would
otherwise be quite difficult to achieve a reliable one and the foothold they give
us is not always reliable especially in the early days right as time goes on and
we gather more data and we get input from other perspectives and orientations
and other modes of acquiring and validating information second parts
really important you know they become a little more reliable over time sometimes
a lot more reliable it just depends on what this is what the statistics are
about and who's producing them and why factors like these but we are not
equipped as ordinary people to disambiguate the information that is
commonly inundating us due to our extremely hyper-paced technological
context and unfortunately that's not going to stop us from doing so everybody's
gotten a pet you know opinion or grievance or perspective and the majority
of them are so poorly informed that to call them informed would be a grave
error of judgment they'd have to they'd have to go they'd have to undergo several
complete OS upgrades to approach informedness and that's not going to
happen either so what am I what am I actually saying here well one of the
things I'm saying is welcome to the shitstorm that are previously believed
activities and motivations and societies set up for you they totally set this up
not intentionally on purpose so that there'd be an apocalypse but with the
clear awareness that that was going to be one of the likely future real outcomes
and among some clades of perpetrators the clear intent to profit from that
right to make a lot of money if you think you only get one lifetime and you
don't believe in an afterlife and you don't believe in karma or something
similar you don't believe that what goes around comes around and there's
plenty of proof that none of that shit is true in a single human lifetime right
all kinds of absolutely evil people I mean literally evil people people who
intended to be evil and weren't just evil unconsciously like most of the evil
people are lots of those people prospered wildly during their lifetimes and if
you only have one lifetime apocalypse doesn't matter because you're gonna face
one anyway think about that that's a really important piece of perspective to
have on the table in front of you when you're trying to understand things that
should be unimaginable like human beings engaged in behaviors that really should
be unimaginable but they're not and part of the reason that they're not is I got
mine fuck you fuck all you people in fact I will take mine from your children
from your ancestors from the history of life on earth from the future I will
burn the whole charade down to get my peace right because if you again if you
only have one lifetime and you know competition is the order of the day you
getting to the top of the pile is the order of the day that perspective is
actually pragmatically useful and makes sense and this is one of the reasons why
I mean this is not terrain I I did not foresee that I would enter this terrain
in the conversation but this is one of the powers of religions that imply there
will be hell to pay for bad behavior right if it doesn't reach you in this
lifetime and even if it does it'll chase you down through future lifetimes or
afterlives or things like this and if there is no afterlife and there are no
future lives then I'm not saying that means there won't be altruism no there
will still be altruism unfortunately though you'll have people who as the as
the cost and accessibility of producing an apocalypse keeps falling toward a
target that is actionable by a single human being or a very small group you
can be in you can be absolutely assured they will table that threat because
it's really simple to see that under the right conditions with the right
beliefs it's appropriate to wipe out everything if they don't if everything
doesn't do what you want it to do and this is of course the ethos of the
actually committed kind of insanity that suicide bombers and so on sometimes
not always have right they believe themselves to not only to be righteous
but to be earning a place in paradise which is kind of the opposite of the
perspective I'm presenting here the perspective here is get your paradise
while it lasts any way you can and for those people who are devotees of that
you know pragmatic agenda it's not the word I want for those devotees they're
pretty much unless they have something inside them that recoils from heinous
lean malignant cruelty and viciousness there's nothing off the table right all
options are on the table they'll torture and steal and murder and imprison everything
the ecologies are just fodder for their bank account and it didn't used to be
possible right for a single human being to have opportunities of this nature to
be tempted in these ways right although you know autocrats and stuff have have
this have long had abilities like this on a limited scale right they couldn't
they couldn't destroy the world but they could they could do a lot of damage to the
extant social systems and frameworks that the common people inhabited and were familiar with
it's really fun to see men being men I'm not getting a lot of experience of that it's
just fun to see them being men together and arguing and hassling each other and you know
prodding each other and kind of playing the sort of I love you and fuck you in
this particular way that I alone know because I know you sort of thing it's
sort of it's you know it's part of what we refer in modern jargon to his bromance but
it's still it's it's charming to see some of that going on I'm not I'm not getting much of that these
days in fact most of us aren't getting a lot of things that we're used to getting and my expectation
is that's going to continue for a long long time that building I was talking about is coming down
right now around us and we're still in freefall and I'm not even sure that the first the top
couple floors have collapsed yet right all we know really is that there's been an impact
and there are casualties right that's that's about the extent of the news we've gotten
and so the mad anthill of the common people is wildly disorganized and completely unprepared
and they are inclined unfortunately to be subject to a variety of malware like diseases
that cause them to suppose that one good move is to police each other with frameworks
derived from the malware itself right so they're not it's not like Joe has some intelligence
that he'd like to present to Tom and Jane and Tina and Tony yeah I'm really into T words
no John's become infected with a particular sort of memetic contagion
and has now become an active radio tower transmitting it to every passerby
including his own family those who previously loved him and so on and so forth now it doesn't
mean there aren't a few trustworthy voices in the wilderness there are but unfortunately
this is exactly the situation in which you get people aping that perspective and believing that
about themselves generally speaking trustworthy intelligences will claim to not know what's
going on right trustworthy heroes won't go around wearing badges I'm a hero
trustworthy companions are not found on the street corners of Los Angeles late at night
you know with various offerings
that mimic the dead remains of what otherwise would have been an erotic relationship
we don't have an umbrella for this kind of shitstorm
and nobody's going to be coming up with one anytime soon again the crucial imperative
is the formation of highly intelligent small scale
co cooperatives collaboratives
that can guide the common people reliably and intelligently
through the collapse of this building right and to whatever we might be able to
preserve to you know to whatever is desirable to preserve first of all but and also to what
we might be able to preserve or retain from the rubble and there might not be a lot worth
preserving this is another implication of Eric and Anna's talk there I was hearing some degree of
oh let that shit burn and I'm kind of in agreement with that I just don't want huge body counts
I don't want any body counts even though I'm completely aware that the earth cannot support
7.8 billion humans and the trillions of machines and products and devices
that accompany them into you know ecological assault
and I'm more concerned about the machines and the devices than the human population I'm
I'm an outlier in this regard most most people will say many people will be heard to say
you know the earth can't sustain 7.8 billion humans well yes it can
but it can't sustain trillions of machines and it can't sustain combustion engines and it can't
sustain an endless program of the production of consumer goods an ever more invasive and
ever more deeply penetrating into the anciently conserved ecologies and their their foundations
you know agenda of turning living beings into objects that's not going to work it never did
work the only reason we survived it this long is that the anciently conserved ecologies were
a rich enough buffer right that we could keep hiding damage in them as a species and pretending
there wasn't any going on none of the living places or beings ever believed that lie to
believe that lie you have to be human you have to be infected with representational cognition
at birth you have to speak languages you have to understand concepts you have to be able to
abstract yourself from actual relationships into ideologies and theories and thoughts and math and
so on not that any of those things are intrinsically bad but they often where they represent a
departure from something resembling relational integrity or you know intellectual integrity
um philosophical integrity fiscal integrity economic integrity the actual stuff not the
theoretical crap um not the disembodied theoretical crap right uh
our capacity for abstraction encourages us to turn away from the bizarre projections
it produces in manufacturing and culture right we just kind of turn away and go like yeah i like
my iphone you know um i'm really into my bmw my tesla is the greatest thing ever
um
and you know the collapse of social unity and mutual concern and mutual engagement
for noble and beneficial and creative and beautiful purposes the collapse of all that leads to this
right and there was very little foundation of that going on when the pandemic began
so it's not like there's a salv there's like a salvageable you know remnant
what we're actually discovering is that to whatever degree that that layer reliably existed
it was compromised in all kinds of ways by needs and agendas and pragmatism and money and power and
attention and you know
the emulation of value without the necessity of delivering it right
sex without love power without consequence
so
it's a fascinating time to be human
it's a deeply disorienting and confusing time to be human
this is uh most likely
either a hairball coughed up by a coyote or one eliminated here's some more
so this looks more like um scat but these hairballs
those are i'm pretty sure evidence of a coyote
having recently passed nearby and that wasn't the first time i'd seen those by the way i'm
i'm familiar with them in their location
the faculties we rely on ordinarily in our in our human lives faculties like memory and
vocabulary and intelligence and the capacity to you know sort of get the since we're since we're
we can be understood to be sort of driving the ship of our own lives the capacities we need to
navigate right our compasses the the faculties we use to derive orientation and motivation from
unfortunately for many of us these faculties are going to undergo sudden shocking transformation
i am not trying to say that none of them will survive or that the results will will be the
same for everyone that's not true they're going to affect each of us uniquely in ways that are also
shared across cohorts um
with these faculties in extended crisis they are too delicate
generally speaking to be well sustained unless you were already fairly isolated
and have learned how to sustain them in an ice you know in an isolation environment
against the intrusion of various malware oriented actors and
memes and information toxicity and you know some people are better prepared than others
psychologically emotionally cognitively metabolically so
you know some some observer might say well we're looking at a speciation event what's
going to happen is we're going to see a die-off you know a very significant die-off in human
populations and to the survivors go the spoils as if the living world or the history of humanity
and life on earth were a winnable commodity
again abstraction divorces us from the meaning of participation of role over time of histories
right most very few people recognize the fact that what we do today changes the meaning of what
happened yesterday if one of us does something so astonishingly beautiful today that it it
validates the sufferings and dreams and struggles of myriads of beings over the entire history of
life on earth that's not a commodity and that kind of behavior is precisely the most valuable form
in a crisis right it's while the building is falling the truly heroic individuals will make
contributions that will change forever what it meant to be human whether we survive as a species or
not and that meaning to me is tangible it's visceral it's alive it's a being not a thing
it's not a book of facts or numbers it's not statistics it is essence it is essential
it is that upon which all those other things find some way to
uh
to become the skin of right to be the surface features of
the superficial expressions of
humanity is capable of intelligence and nobility we've seen nearly no evidence of
in our modern context and i'd like to hope that there is at least a cohort of people among us
i know i keep using this word um there are cohorts of intelligent highly motivated brilliant
creative playful um concerned human beings
who will grab the opportunity
of a world plunge suddenly into crisis
and produce something analogous to a vehicle in which we can ride through them together
toward a future worth inhabiting
toward a future that rather than devaluing our humanity
embraces and enriches it
and that is my dream and that is part of why i'm on fire today
and if a little spark has crossed the gap between us then i celebrate that
but even if it hasn't perhaps someday it will thank you for joining me
