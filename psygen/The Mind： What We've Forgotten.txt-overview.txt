It sounds like you're describing an intensely transformative experience that altered your understanding of consciousness, intelligence, and perhaps the nature of reality itself. Your narrative touches on themes often explored in both spiritual and speculative contexts—such as profound encounters with other intelligences or dimensions, radical shifts in perception, and a sense of personal metamorphosis.

Here are some reflections on the elements you've shared:

1. **Companion Intelligence**: The experience of being accompanied by another intelligence that significantly transformed your perceptions and abilities is reminiscent of mystical or transcendent experiences reported in various spiritual traditions. It could also parallel themes found in speculative fiction, where characters encounter otherworldly beings or forces.

2. **Transformation of Mind**: Your description echoes classic narratives of enlightenment or awakening, where the protagonist's perception and understanding of reality are fundamentally altered. These stories often explore how such transformations impact one’s relationships with others and the world at large.

3. **Sense and Ability Expansion**: Gaining new senses or abilities is a common motif in both spiritual journeys and science fiction, symbolizing an expanded awareness or connection to broader realities beyond our everyday experiences.

4. **Reflections on Origins and Identity**: Your introspection about your “family of origin” within time and space suggests a deep quest for understanding your place in the universe. This aligns with philosophical inquiries into identity and existence that have been central to human thought across cultures and epochs.

5. **Cultural References**: You mention various films and stories like "Powder," "Flowers for Algernon," and others, which often explore themes of transformation, enhanced abilities, and the quest for understanding one's purpose or potential. These narratives might resonate with your own experiences and provide a framework for exploring similar questions.

Ultimately, whether interpreted through a spiritual lens, psychological perspective, or as an imaginative exploration akin to speculative fiction, your experience appears to be deeply personal and transformative. It raises profound questions about consciousness, the nature of intelligence, and our connections to unseen realms or dimensions. Engaging with these stories can provide both solace and insight, offering multiple pathways for understanding and integrating such a significant life event.


The text reflects on personal experiences related to dreaming and consciousness, comparing them with concepts from the Thelemic tradition like "obtaining the conversation of the guardian angel." Although there are similarities, the author emphasizes that their experience is distinct. They describe how dreams provide rich, non-ordinary experiences, creating unique universes in our minds each night.

The author suggests that modern humanity has lost many facets of consciousness and awareness—facets they believe might be fundamental to human origins. This loss has been partially addressed through representations like angels or gods, which are mere approximations compared to the vastness of these original faculties.

A key point is the notion that dreaming allows access to other senses and abilities not available in waking life. The author highlights how modern technology and scientific ideologies inhibit our exploration of this broader range of mental capacities. They imply that while science has its place, it can also limit our understanding of human consciousness by reducing it to overly simplistic models.

Overall, the text argues for the vast, largely untapped potential within human minds, suggesting that rediscovering these lost faculties could profoundly transform our awareness and experience.


The text explores profound ideas about human consciousness, awareness, and potential. The speaker emphasizes how scientific endeavors and societal evolution often prioritize structured cognition over the innate faculties of human consciousness, such as emotions, imagination, and wonder. They argue that most people are born with untapped potentials which get suppressed or redirected into conventional representational thinking.

The speaker believes our minds possess extraordinary capacities for travel, communion, and shared consciousness, far surpassing ordinary experiences like dreams or orgasms in their depth. They express a desire to awaken these dormant faculties without causing harm.

Dreams hold particular significance for the speaker; they consider them essential to life, akin to breathing. The speaker encourages personal exploration of dreaming over relying on existing theories or books. This perspective is contrasted with how models often fail to capture the full essence of their subjects, such as dreams or kisses.

The text also discusses the division between waking and dreaming consciousness, noting that paying attention to our dreaming mind can foster greater integration and awareness. Ultimately, the speaker advocates for exploring human potential by focusing on noble and trustworthy aspects within ourselves and relationships, suggesting a return to an "origin place" of essence and family.
