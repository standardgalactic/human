Your message touches on several profound themes: environmental awareness, technology's impact on society, and philosophical reflections on human consciousness and behavior. Here’s a brief summary:

1. **Environmental Awareness**: You observe wildlife closely, noting behaviors such as laterality in blue jays and the effects of cold weather on animals. This observation reflects a deep connection with nature and concern for its well-being.

2. **Technology and Society**: The discussion about constructs not having human qualities like empathy or compassion critiques how technology can dehumanize aspects of society. It suggests that while technological systems can sometimes include human elements, they often lack genuine human consciousness and emotion.

3. **Philosophical Reflections on Human Nature**: You reference Ian McGilchrist’s work on brain hemispheric lateralization, indicating an interest in how different parts of the brain might influence our cognition and behavior differently. This ties into your broader commentary about constructs being driven by a "defective" aspect of human nature that prioritizes domination and structure over empathy and connection.

4. **Metaphoric Imagery**: The metaphor of hawks above humanity reflects existential concerns about external forces (whether real or imagined) influencing or controlling our lives, potentially dehumanizing us in the process.

5. **Critique of Collectives and Systems**: You describe societal systems as "demons" that consume resources and human values for their own expansion, drawing parallels to mythological dragons hoarding treasures without understanding their true value.

Overall, your reflections combine ecological sensitivity with critical insights into technology's role in society, using rich metaphorical language to explore the complexities of human existence.
