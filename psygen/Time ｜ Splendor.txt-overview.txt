Your exploration delves into how our experiences and interactions with time are deeply intertwined with relationships—whether with other people, animals, plants, or even technology. You suggest that modern lifestyles often isolate us from these rich temporal layers by reducing complex relational dynamics to simplified interactions (e.g., text messages instead of in-person meetings) or by mechanizing tasks like driving, which disconnects us from the physical experience of space and memory.

The notion you propose is that our perception of time should not be linear or isolated but rather a symphony of relationships across different scales—from the microscopic level within cells to the macroscopic interactions among organisms. You highlight how everyday environments and technologies might constrain this broader understanding of temporality, reducing rich, interconnected experiences into singular dimensions.

You also touch upon a philosophical critique of individualism, suggesting that it may oversimplify or ignore the complex web of temporal relationships that truly define existence. By emphasizing the importance of embodied experience in natural settings (like observing birds, plants, and spiders), you argue for a more integrated approach to understanding our place in the world—one that acknowledges and celebrates the intricate dances of time as they occur across various scales and forms.

This perspective invites us to reconsider how we live, interact with technology, and understand ourselves—not merely as isolated entities but as integral parts of a vast temporal ecosystem.


The text explores themes related to narrow worldviews, temporality, transformation, and our disconnection from the natural rhythms of life due to modern conceptual frameworks. The author uses metaphors such as a prosthesis and the complex plane in mathematics to illustrate how we lose touch with reality when overly relying on simplified representations.

A key idea is the analogy of caterpillars transforming into butterflies, symbolizing profound change and renewal that echoes ancient temporal processes, contrasting sharply with our linear perception of time. This transformation highlights a rich interplay of temporal rhythms across different life forms, suggesting that each organism experiences time uniquely.

The text criticizes modern notions of identity, form, and truth for confining us from the beauty and complexity inherent in nature's temporalities. It laments how these ideas have been replaced by superficial constructs like "tokeny, metarchy, accounting crap," urging a return to more authentic engagements with time and existence.

Ultimately, the author calls for rekindling an appreciation for life’s mysteries through wonder and reverence, akin to our distant ancestors' experiences, emphasizing that we are naturally attuned to these diverse temporalities. The piece concludes by encouraging curiosity about the true nature of time beyond its conventional representations.
