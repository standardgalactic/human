The passage you provided seems to be a contemplative reflection on time, its nature, and the current state of affairs. Here are some key points and themes that emerge:

1. **Nature of Time**: The author suggests a non-linear perspective on time, akin to how time feels in dreams—where past and future are interconnected with the present moment. This view challenges conventional linear perceptions where time flows unidirectionally from past to future.

2. **Impact of Actions**: The idea that actions in the present can alter interpretations or structures of the past is proposed. By doing something extraordinary now, one could change how previous events are perceived and understood.

3. **Complexity of Time**: Time is described as a multi-layered concept with different flows influencing each other—some moving backward, others forward, some vibrating or oscillating.

4. **Perception Shifts**: The author mentions personal awareness since around 2002 about significant shifts in time's nature and a more profound change noted in late 2018. This shift is felt personally but also noticed by others, suggesting it might be a broader phenomenon.

5. **Cultural Reflections**: There’s a critique of modern rationality that flattens experiences, contrasting this with older cultures’ richer, participatory ways of being in the world. These ancient perspectives are seen as deeper and more human.

6. **Current Global State**: The author expresses concern about something fundamentally wrong with time and by extension, the current state of the world. This sentiment is echoed in conversations overheard from others, including children.

This passage reflects a philosophical exploration of time that intersects with personal experiences, cultural observations, and existential concerns. It invites readers to consider alternative ways of understanding temporal reality beyond conventional frameworks.


The text discusses people experiencing unusual dreams and a sense of mental or cognitive crisis. The speaker reflects on a personal perception that there is an impending catastrophe sending shockwaves backward in time, affecting the present moment. This notion is tied to broader observations about ecological destruction and its impact on human consciousness.

Key themes include:
- **Unusual Experiences**: Many sensitive individuals are experiencing crises unrelated directly to events like the pandemic.
- **Temporal Disturbance**: The speaker theorizes that a future catastrophe affects the current temporal state, causing turbulence in how time is perceived.
- **Ecological Impact**: Destroying ancient ecosystems, which are integral to human cognition, leads to diminishing awareness and intelligence.
- **Call for Awareness**: Emphasizing vigilance and courage in facing these unknown challenges, urging collective understanding and resilience.

The speaker stresses that while the exact nature of these issues may not be fully understood, recognizing their presence is crucial. They encourage others to remain hopeful and supportive as they navigate this complex and potentially troubling period.
