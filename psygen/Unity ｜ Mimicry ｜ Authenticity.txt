is often harassed by machine noises no this this pond is a it's fed from an underground aquifer but
it's a it's a mechanically you know sustained pond right you can see the the pipe
and of course everything here in the gardens is artificial in the sense that humans decided
here we will make a park it was all sand dunes and and so they made a park here but one can't
see it I can't anyway see it in the same way as I might see you know like a fork or a book or a
machine it's not artificial in that sense because there's there's a living collaboration going on
excuse me even if the humans are not particularly sensitive collaborators
this is a mash-up of human ideas and anciently evolved life forms that ordinarily don't find
themselves in in such diverse proximity to one another around this little pond is bamboo
and in the wind the bamboo makes a very unique it has a library of music sit makes that's it's quite
profound but I was walking past the pond and I dropped something a couple coins fill out my purse
as I was looking around and so I thought I'd wander over I thought I would interpret the
coins dropping from my purse as a signal to pay attention right here right there's in other words like
there's value here right the the metification of the playful metification right not like a religion
more like an adventure and so my the coins fell out of my purse and as I reached down to pick them up I
thought huh maybe I won't just walk on maybe I'll start paying attention right here and then I saw
the migrating water plant situation not to mention the wonderful reflection in the water the reflections
in the water they are enchanting I mean one might call them enchantments in the water
but whether or not they seem inviting and open whether or not they inspire us with wonder or
awe or even fear of their astonishing depth and potentials and I mean that in sense of you
in our relation with them emotionally, imaginably, cognitively and with our hearts, with our essence
the reflections are truly profound but only for those who can find the path beyond
the tragically vacuous nature of our our adulthood that sees things in terms of functions and oh I
already know about that I was thinking the other day and this is not an uncommon thought for me
but I think a glimpse of the actual nature of any tree any old tree or you know an ant
or anything that any of the living beings right a glimpse if the tree could actually reveal to us
which they can providing we're properly receptive something of the nature of its
way of being its essence
what it carries within in terms of
knowledge and histories and unexpected opportunities for animals and human beings
if we could see for just a moment the tiniest glimpse of what a living being actually is
or without like I said not without we don't need to see all of it and it doesn't have to be
perfectly correct it just needs to to have the proper dimensionality right the depth the living
depth that's actually there it would obliterate religion all of our religions would look
a bit clumsy to be kind and you know science would pass out in shock I think
or scientists would since science isn't really a being and can't can't pass out
no all of our stories would be rocked to their core in fact we'd have to revise our knowledge of
everything from the ground up if we could get a tiny glimpse an authentic glimpse
into the being of any of the living beings that we so easily dismiss with words
I remember saying I used to know the name of the little plant
and I'm pretty sure I did but be assured that never helped me much
because that name doesn't contain any knowledge
I was listening to something I've long been aware of
well I think by the way I think the same thing would happen if a stone could
you know communicate to us and perhaps all of this doesn't seem to make a lot of sense on the
surface or like I have some it might seem like I have some strange religion or you know something
like this here is what I am quite sure is a coyote burrow and it's probably a little bit dangerous
to approach it but I don't know because I have so little experience with animal burrows but let's
have a look nonetheless
discovered this a couple of weeks ago and
it's only been about two and a half weeks
since I saw my first animal burrow and I was very cautious because I don't know what to expect I
don't know if it's reasonably safe to approach or not
if the animal might suddenly come out and I don't actually know what animal is in there
and I was just confused because I've been in the gardens for many years and I've never seen a
burrow like this though I'm sure the workers here probably have
and this is a trail where I commonly come across coyote scape
and I expect that it's a coyote burrow but in the back of my mind I secretly wonder if it might be
something even more more feral and I think of badgers as more feral I'm curious is it possible
there could be badgers here I've heard one person very emphatically declare that they saw a badger
in here but I've never seen any evidence of such a situation and I think there'd be some
so it might sound like like I have some kind of strange religion
and I don't mind really if people misinterpret me but I'd rather communicate clearly enough
that some of my intended meaning you know arises in the imagination of those who listen
people like you and thank you for listening though I'm all surgically prepared here
for my my adventure in the garden today
and it's off to a good start with the
the little vortex in the pond
just as I was saying everything here is man-made in the sense of humans planned and built and
established and brought in all these plants and tend them and edit them and regularize them
and on the one hand it's absolutely gorgeous and wonderful but there's a kind of there are
many tragic aspects to it the plants are deprived of their natural symbionts if they're not from around
here and some of them are so peculiarly developed that they live in very close symbiosis with one or two
or twelve other large organisms and possibly hundreds of maybe thousands of microorganisms kinds
of microorganisms so you know humans and their zoos
I understand the idea the implementation
there's much to be desired well with zoos it's a nightmare
but I don't really have a religion about it what I have
are very surprising experiences in which usually unexpectedly
nature reaches out
this is the place where a tragedy took place
this is one of this is one of the darker moments of adventure
came here one day making a video set my phone down here just this blue barrel
I saw a beautiful raptor feather back here
and then as I looked into the barrel which had about this much water in it
there was a drowned raptor inside the barrel
and I've taken that video down
for reasons I can't entirely explain
but I've had experiences where suddenly and unexpectedly
doorways into the intelligences of nature and the relations of living places and beings
have suddenly opened up and invited me in to remember
to recognize to see from non-human perspectives and some of them
far exceed our wildest dreams
they're they're so profound and exotic it is not possible to imagine them
but to be drawn directly into the experience and you know this happens actually
there isn't anything else that's happening it's just that the scale and scope and
discontinuity
is most often for us very low right very small
we may appreciate the beauty of this detoura
I wonder why it has so few leaves I wonder if it's seasonal
these plants fill the air with astonishing fragrances in the night
I've had experiences where suddenly unexpectedly I've
traveled through
very difficult to think of how to talk about this meaning clearly
something in the foundation of my mind
and perhaps my body and maybe something else that I don't have the right word for
but it could be my soul shifts and often this shift is unexpected even though I could be
seeking it I keep going along thinking I'd like to have an adventure in nature's doorways today
sort of like I am now in my waking mind you know my ordinary like I think this
would be really fun and I would like to learn some more and see again and remember again
and that intention is very helpful in some way
but luck and opportunity and so many other things are involved so many other qualities are involved
but it's not that I have a strange religion
it's that I have experiences
in and with living creatures in nature
but there is no corollary of in my ordinary human life knowledge expectation thought perception
they are outside completely
they even make experiences of significant intoxication or psychedelia up here
relatively timid in comparison and also kind of fake in a specific way that's difficult to
encapsulate in language there's a kind of
it's as if there is in fact
so hard not to use value laden words
there is something holy in the sense of
more than merely unified right it's a one that keeps finding new ways to be more than
merely a unity in other words you can imagine this right you can imagine very simply
a set of points we'll think of them as beings and we'll connect five of them right and then we'll draw
we'll give them each new colors of connection right now we get a new dimension of unity
and then we connect some in more intimate loops of union and others in
what could we say uh oh we'll just put a little mark next to the other groups right so you can see that
something that's fundamentally unified can continue to develop new dimensions of unity
right which i often think of as new degrees of freedom because in essence there are new dimensions in
which we can um sense interact and we mimic this process with our machines which is really weird
except that i it's very clear to me why we get why we why we do the mimicry instead of the
well what i mean is once the mimicry begins and people become fascinated with it
what it's mimicking disappears from our our sense our access
because we become trained by the resulting commodities and representations and transactions
and so on and so forth and these are really very tedious and sort of dimensionally dead
they're dead inside there's no there there there's no real content
and much of it is mediated by machines and money
um
there isn't anything the humans have learned that wasn't derived from nature
so if you want to go to the original place it's all waiting
um and some of the living world is deeply excited not not everywhere not all the time
but some of the world is deeply excited uh and is seeking an opportunity so to speak
um
to bridge the old gulf between the humans and the sky between the humans
and the origins of life and being between the humans and the living places between the humans
and the animals between the humans and the plants
because the humans are very powerful not to mention
unexpectedly confusable
and so very dangerous and so the living places and the living beings
um
well i wonder if i'm anthropomorphizing here
well i think
i think
there's a natural reticence
that that could be felt by the living places and the living beings
um
because our class of animal
is unpredictable disoriented ravenous cruel ignorant blind and very very powerful so that looks just about like a demon really it looks like just something that's totally disoriented and ripping things apart with an endless hunger to produce things that actually don't matter much
um so there's a natural trepidation
um in in relation to our class of animal and see here's the real problem
when in thought or cognition properties of the that we've associated with individual experiences or specific experiences of some group we distinguish
when we decide to transfer those properties to the entire class
of people so that we then say for example
man of x kind right are all
why because some men of x kind have been known to be why
why so this is the fallacy of exchanging the
qualities of instances of extending them over the whole class and the humans do this all the time
um you can see this going on all over the news
in social media um our modern situation might even be said to have weaponized this possibility
so because the humans are sort of generally mean and untrustworthy and most of the encounters
that living creatures and living places have with humans do not go well for them
if there's any kind of extended contact and part of the reason is that the humans are just not really in the relationship at all
in a way they're kind of like a disembodied animal they're really from from nature's perspective we'd be really terrifying
i think we'd be at least as terrifying as the idea of
like of aliens who are totally estranged from our humanity would be to us
so the situation is a little bit peculiar however thankfully nature isn't very thinky
it has this other way of being intelligent that's nothing like words
um and much deeper and much richer and more trustworthy and it has humor but it doesn't disemble
um i've never i i recall no experience i can get things wrong but
i recall no experience of the living world speaking with me in which i wasn't aware
of encountering a species of truth so deep so absolutely trustworthy as if my bones and the mind
i beheld it with were made of it right it was it wasn't mere recognition of truth it was a kind of self recognition
of oh yeah this is what the essence of minds and intelligence and consciousness and being
oh yes now i remember it's like this experience that i you know often well occasionally is a better word
have with living beings or places the lake the ocean the night sky the garden a tree some animal some insects
and again the language is very tricky and value laden people will suppose i'm talking
about you know spirituality that this is the topic that i'm on it's not
that's one of the few branches that's one of the few ways of knowing
yes filled with counterfeit nonsense but not itself essentially nonsensical
that's one of the only ways of knowing that we have any input from that resembles what i'm
you know reflecting upon
but there was a time before which there was a time before which
things were thus distinguished right there was a time before which
there was any idea of spirituality and whatever we might use that word to refer to was either
not going on because it's sort of a modern thing or it was so embodied and embedded
that it was indistinguishable from just being
right the same way one's emotions are kind of indistinguishable from just being one's
uh relationally extended sensorium was just indistinguishable from being
i suspect our ancestors regularly felt the
they were engaged in living conversations with animals and plants and living places
and song was involved in these conversations
song was regularly involved and also song resulted from these conversations
it was a product because the ecstasy of such a conversation
the the relief at finally being welcomed back into a circle
of deeply authentic
purpose shared mutual purpose deeply authentic intelligence knowledge of a kind
that supersedes both thought and dreaming
that refreshing reassurance
and you know it's a shared thing it goes both ways it's as if
somehow i'm the long lost family member of this pond and this pond
is the is is like the physical
cool
the pond is a living secret that recognizes me
and is recognized when we when our essences come together in conversation
and so we both transform in a way that's ancient and familiar and
unique to every experience yet not dissimilar along the continuum of experiences
i wonder if the frogs are still here
i don't hear their plops
i was thinking of many things today i was thinking of um
um
some of the sort of Taoist ideas
embodied in martial arts particularly perhaps tai chi qi geng sheng yi ba gua
pushing hands twi shao
i was thinking about this uh place before the
the yin and the yang have divided before they divide
and become active stillness
i think there are endless varieties of stillness and
often i accidentally stumble into a kind of inner stillness before
just before a doorway in nature opens up
the stillness and the invitation
they seem related

C
than the entire collection of human conjectures.
And we're made of it.
It's not right next door.
We're made of it.
We're made of this astonishing accessible
wonderment.
And
our original home remembers us.
Our home before bodies,
before identities.
It remembers us.
And the world is all made of this,
but there's a kind of reflective shell
on the top.
And it's composed of habits and thinking and names
and concepts and science and
that shell is very peculiar.
But the mind is layered.
I was thinking about this too.
And the layers are almost like
they can be thought of usefully
as a similar to the geologic strata, right?
That paleontologists and geologists
and similar folks or archaeologists study, right?
The strata of time.
And so our minds are like this.
And the superficial shell like this
official shell like structure is super new
and there's no room to move around in there
in the sense
in the senses that there would be
if you could go down just one layer
to a little bit older strata, right?
But there's stuff in our minds
in the sort of nature of this
layered manifold.
There's stuff in there
for purposes.
We've written stories about
but very rarely embodied in the modern
world.
There's a reason why we have myths and religions
and it's not because some people a long time ago
like to make up really fantastical things
and scare each other with them.
No, that's not why we have them.
There's all of the aspects of
heroism, altruism,
tragedy, hubris, drama, nemesis.
All of these things
they are the
the rather
well, in their time they were different.
That's the problem.
The minds we read them now can't see the richness they encode
unfortunately for most of us.
Though we can learn to
and I think that's a wonderful thing to do
to try to understand the minds of the ancients
and also the
the developmental course,
the sort of course and the milestones
and the adventures we can discover
in the evolution of human consciousness.
So I was thinking about the layered mind
and how
if we could get but the tiniest glimpse
of the essence of any living being
it's real nature
or it's more truthful nature.
If we could just slightly more closely approach
what's actually going on with consciousness
in a way where we become participants again
in a conversation
then
the sky's not the limit.
There is no limit.
In fact, yeah
because there's so much depth there
that our modern minds
cannot admit
and if they can admit some of it
they're very inclined
by
knowledge and context and especially
if we are single language users and so on
they're very inclined to
flatten
the whole idea of identity
you know a tree is just
blah blah blah some tree
a laurel or an oak
a name
and that's pretty much the end of their
interest in the situation
unless it can be converted into a lumber
you know it's particularly beautiful
and they like to preserve it or something like that
they have some utilitarian
idea
of course there are many people who
have discovered that there are doorways
in nature to varying depths
but most of them have
stayed within the human
knowledge framework
the modern human knowledge frameworks
and those
are incapable
of admitting
the incredible
I don't know what other word to use
there's like this profusion of dimensional
existence
and intelligence
and awareness
but I mean that's just the beginning
if we could glimpse
the essence of a sparrow
or any one thing at all
I mean this is the weird thing that humans don't know the first thing about anything
we have theories about
mechanical relationships between
distinguishable elements
suppose you had that about me
well what would that do for you
what would you know of me
not much
and it's certainly this is
both necessary and insufficient
in terms of a relationship with nature
it seems necessary we want to know the mechanics
why do we want to know the mechanics
and what will we do with them
these are incredibly important questions
our world view
has this shell that reflects
that like reflects incoming
novelty away from us
reflects incoming signals and communication
it just doesn't penetrate
it doesn't penetrate the
our world view
our world concept
in which trees are just
plants
funguses are just
funguses, viruses are just
viruses
we have no
the relationship is totally abstract
that's not a relationship
that's the problem
it's not that it's unuseful
to have abstract knowledge
that it presents dangers
of defection
from embodied knowing
and deep
communion
if
there's no reason for reverence
other than the complexity
of the structures derived
from analysis
I think we're lost
if this in no way
invalidates the beauty
of
that we can
feel or sense
in
mathematics or physics or biology
which are
very clinical
sort of
toward objective
knowledge
knowing paths
and I don't want to throw them away
but
or yet
they have our familiarity
with them
has transferred
the places where
they're incredibly shallow
to the supercontainer
to the everything
so that our world view has been denuded
by the way
we
authorize or over authorize
not science
or scientific thought
but what we make of it
in terms of its
entailments
so if we universalize the entailments
of a relatively young system
of knowledge
we've made some very
dangerous
and deceptive mistake because once we do that
we've changed the thing we see with
see the problem there
you're really going to have a hard time fixing that
if you change the thing you see with
in a way that deprives you
of
liberties
kinds of liberty
you're going to have a really hard time
even noticing that happened
because you can't see changes
to the thing you see with
with the thing you see with
maybe that should be a tongue twister
and this
is part of what's
what's gone on with our species
as we became modern
we kept
changing
the thing we compose our world view with
and of
in such a way
that it became analytically sophisticated
and relationally
crippled
and
if you can only have one of these
you probably want relationships
because
the analysis isn't going to be much good
without oxygen
or you know trees

names in English are kind of broken
it would be better if names told us something
profound about what they refer to
I was thinking about that too
as often crosses my mind
I don't reject outright
I don't reject the Latinate
you know
the Latin biological taxonomies
those are useful
where they are useful
but
our names should say something about
our relationships
with the beings
and the nature of the beings
that we tag them with
I would like that
I would like to speak a language
that is like that
I would like to know a language that is like that
and in nature
when I have an experience
that's not good
oroplanes
One of them was carrying
One of them was carrying an extended fuel tank.
I heard warplanes this morning and I was concerned.
However, I think it's likely that it's about to be fleet week here or something like this.
I'm not certain. I'll find out later.
You'd think if something made that much noise humans would realize this is just a really bad idea.
I mean, yeah, sure, it flies, but it makes thundering catastrophe of sound.
Like, not in any good way.
And I guess as a war machine that's probably a good quality.
But it just seems like an incredibly bad idea to me.
Which is very ironic because as a child I thought jet aircraft were the greatest thing ever.
And I wanted to be, you know, like a fighter pilot or an astronaut or both and more.
Who knows what, a spaceman.
I guess I kind of became a spaceman but in a very ironic way.
Nothing like going to outer space.
More like bringing outer space home.
Drawing it down from the sky into us.
Which I think is, you know, maybe one of the peculiar specializations of our species that's been forgotten.
Though you see its spirit in science fiction and things like this.
We've lost wonder, our, uh, the scientific, not scientific but the scientific.
Projections on identity and meaning and truth have been very strange.
Inclined us to blindness.
Of many different kinds.
And this isn't because the science isn't good.
It's because we transfer what we learned from the science to other things, right?
World views and ideas and bases for evaluation.
The other thing I was thinking about earlier, since I think I'm going to wrap up here pretty quick.
I was just thinking about the profoundly amazing idea.
And I'm, though I'm not, um...
I'm certainly not entitled to speak about anything.
How can I say this? It's very strange.
And the only reason I'm even saying this is because modernity has gone loopy.
But, um, I'm not really entitled to speak with knowledge about the ways of life of Blackfoot people.
But I have learned some things from Blackfoot people.
And...
Their teepees are really quite a profound thing because...
There are little instances of the universe, right?
So...
Their opening points, I think usually in a specific direction.
And if I get any of this wrong, I'm happy to be corrected.
It's not the important point that I get every piece right.
Or even that I deeply know what I'm talking about.
I don't.
I'm just fascinated.
I'm not entitled to speak knowingly about these things.
I'm just curious and filled with wonder.
So...
That, it seems to me, might be excusable.
In case somebody wanted to form an accusation.
In any case...
Their homes that they live in, or they lived in, when they lived in teepees,
were really a profoundly unusual thing.
So...
They were like...
See, here's the problem. They weren't exactly things.
I think if we were able to think meaningfully about the teepees,
if one was able to, if I was able to, if you were able to, if we could do it together,
we'd have an initial problem in that there wouldn't be a correct category to place them in.
Right?
They are not just things.
They are not precisely beings.
They have qualities that necessarily...
That are necessarily intrinsic to them.
That cause the categories that we would ordinarily distinguish, I think, to kind of collapse.
And again, I'm happy if someone disagrees with me.
Maybe this is more my perspective than a Blackfoot perspective.
But from what I understood and took in my own way, I will admit, and take responsibility for,
this is a problem.
For regular Western minds, right?
There are properties and qualities and functions of teepees in Black...
In, you know, before the colonists came, at least, and maybe for some time after, and still today.
That cause them to not fit in any ordinary category.
Because they have some qualities associated with beings, yet they are not beings.
They have qualities associated with things, yet they are not things.
They have qualities associated with the universe, yet they are not the universe.
Precisely.
But what they can be thought of is little, unique instances...
On the outside, there are sky beings.
The sun may appear, the moon may appear, the morning star may be indicated, the...
I call it the companion star, but the false morning star may be indicated.
Around the base, there are often, it's often like a band of dark with some white circles that go around the base,
though this is not the only way.
Those have a very special significance.
The structure of the teepee itself is quite profound because it's scalar, right?
First of all, it's one thing, but it has components.
It's scalar, it goes from a sort of a point to a base.
And on the outside, there could be animals, too, on the outside.
But usually, there are routes inside the animals that are significant and depicted.
It might be a bear, there might be a deer, there might be another animal.
And the significances of these things are not western.
They have extra dimensions of meaning that we don't do.
But in the collection of teepees, right, each one is similar, but each one is unique.
And on the outside, there is sort of the sky and the world of origin.
And on the inside, there is the home and the heart and the fire.
And it's one place, so there's no privacy inside, inside, there.
It's almost like each little family is a bit like mankind's relationship to the sky, inside the teepee.
There's all different ways of thinking about it, useful ones.
But my point is just that if you live inside a living world model, which like these teepees, which might seem to us to be ridiculous,
they might seem to us to be primitive or not sufficiently advanced or protective for the elements or so on and so forth.
It's so profound to think of the difference in the ways of life of a people who live inside a teepee
that depict their relationships, that recall and remind them and embody their relationships with their ancestors
and the sky and the origins of life and death and the living places, the living beings.
Their homes embody these relationships and it's not merely symbolic.
This is the really cool thing.
Though symbols, though we would call those symbols, I don't think they would.
Because they're not really symbols, they're function.
Actually even the whole language doesn't work.
They're not there to function.
That's not why they make, you know.
I mean yes, of course they make teepees to function, but I mean the symbols and the sun being there for instance and so on.
So it's really profound that they lived within these embodied reflections of the universe as they understood and experienced it together.
And how different that is from living in a box, even though in a sense we're doing the same thing.
We're living in a model of the universe.
We've just forgotten that this is so and architects all know this and have all kinds of interesting ways of playing with that.
But ours is extremely structured, representational, which is less than symbolic.
We've sacrificed more depth and richness than mere symbols might.
Though of course I'm speaking very generally.
There are unique examples of different things all over the place.
I'm looking at what concerns me.
So these are some of the things I've been rolling over in my mind today.
I appreciate all of you very much and hope that our travels together while I get my exercise and visit the garden are somehow refreshing, nourishing and thought provoking.
I thought I don't really like the word provoke.
I don't want to provoke thoughts.
Are those pears?
Or are they figs?
I've got to figure this out.
They look like figs actually.
Thank you for joining me.
Hope to see you again soon.
Bye bye for now.
Thank you for watching.
