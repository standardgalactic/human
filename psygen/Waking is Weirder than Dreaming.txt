Hey everybody.
I was just getting a view
of the areas surrounding my house from up high
and I realized for a moment
suddenly that my actual situation is far
stranger than the stuff that happens to us in dreams
which we think of as weird and
very difficult for me to understand the actual etymological
origins of this word weird.
It seems the little that I know of it
is that it comes from Greek and has to do
with something like something that is mostly
flow or transformation or spirit
or supernaturalish
these kinds of things.
But what's actually truly weird isn't our dreaming
where things change unexpectedly
adopting new features of meaning
and relational exchange or
co-catalyzation
or even recursion
or creative rather than a mechanical kind
and what's actually really weird
is the fact of the constancy
of our waking experience as regards those same things
identity, temporal continuation
the chair will be there when I turn around
just as it always was just as it shall ever be
the strange permanence
of features, situations
context, histories, transformations
that strange permanence is much
weirder than the kind of
naturally
mind generating
beauty, mysteriousness
and
richness really
of our experience in dreaming.
In order to dream in this world
it seems we have to resist
the intrusion of the seemingly static
continuous permanent features
of identity and possibility in relation
so yeah maybe this world is actually much, much weirder
than the one in which we're dreaming
weird for its unchangingness
weird for its almost
consistent reliability
