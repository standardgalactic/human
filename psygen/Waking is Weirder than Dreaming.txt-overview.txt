The text explores the concept of "weird," noting that it originates from Greek and relates to flow, transformation, or the supernatural. It argues that while dreams are perceived as weird due to their unpredictable changes, the truly strange aspect of reality is its constancy. The permanence of our waking experience—where identity, time, and context remain consistent—is posited as being weirder than the ever-changing nature of dreams. This reliability in our daily life contrasts with the fluid and creative dynamics we encounter while dreaming. Thus, the author suggests that our world's stability is what makes it truly weird.
