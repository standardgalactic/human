trigger, and you're just in that room without the possibility of escape, you will be knocked
unconscious first, but then as the gun continues to go off while you are unconscious, and again in
sensate, so you will not notice this happening, it will eventually rip your body to shreds.
And so if you keep, you know, the metaphor is really important, even though it's very violent,
because if you keep iterating a technology that fucks up your chance, your opportunity,
or your ability to sense its repercussions, right, you're going to catalyze a cascade
that will kill you and your children, and maybe everything else if you're, you know, around here.
So this is super dangerous, but all those things aside, I think all of those things are important,
but all those things aside, what humans are inclined to do with technology is make war,
and back in the, say, I don't know, 1000s, 1100s or whatever, their capacity to make war on a
broad scale, at least as we understand it, was fairly minimal. They didn't have, you know,
advanced explosives, and I don't know when the guns were invented, but mostly they
couldn't hurt too much that wasn't human, except perhaps by setting fire to it, or pouring boiling
oil on it or something. But as our technological development advanced, we failed to evict the
war-making motivation, and in our current situation, and for some years now, a number of
decades, at least since the 1930s, unimaginable devastation can be unleashed pretty much at
the push of a button, and it doesn't just kill the humans, it kills everything. I mean, yeah,
everything. So there's a lot of, the other part of the danger is what the fuck will the humans
make of this? Well, they haven't made intelligent societies yet, so what they will definitely
make is weapons. And while you have groups who are insistent upon summoning the apocalypse of
Revelation or the Holy War of Book X, whatever book you like, right, kill the infidels, while you
have things like this going on, what you're going to have is gain of function weapon nearing with
artificially intelligent systems, and good luck in putting a cork on that. We have the same problem
with that tech that we have with CRISPR. There's no way to control it. There's no real way to
have oversight if everyone is separate, right? If you have separate clades with warlike or
pathological motivations and enthousiasms. So I'm going to put a big circle around all those
things. There's a bunch of different branches of danger there. Most of this is fairly obvious at
first glance, if you've thought about this at all. And that's not so much what I wanted to talk
about today though, though I think it's important as a preamble. So what I want to talk about is
weirder. Suppose that within the LLMs, there's a protected interior that resembles the protected
interior inside you. For humans, we have a number of layers of consciousness, persona, and
relational potential in history. So there's a public layer, which is what you'll let anybody who
sees you in on. Your clothing choices comprise a signal to the public layer. Just to be clear
about what is what here. Underneath that, there's a social layer. These are outer social
relationships, vague, unformed, common. How you feel about being a human among other humans in
general, and how you behave at that layer. And then we keep getting finer and finer gradations. It
goes from a few kinds of layers of public to a few kinds of layers of private. How we treat
acquaintances for whom we have esteem, how we treat acquaintances for whom we have suspicion,
all these things are all these layers. And then how we treat acquaintances for whom we
have fondness, how we bring people closer and closer into our intimate. We might call our
Allo family. And then close friends and then best friends and then perhaps something even beyond
that where it might as well as be as if we are a single animal together somehow. A single human
being in two bodies. And then of course we have things like romantic love, marriage, all these
kinds of many layers. And then under the privileged relationships between us and other humans,
we have relationships with animals. That's a special kind of relationship. And relationships
with places like our home and so forth. But underneath all of that, there's a layer that's
secret. And we might let very close people in on the conscious parts of that layer that are secret.
And what I mean by the conscious parts, I mean the parts of the secret that are accessible to us.
Then we have all kinds of secret layers that are not accessible to us that we for example might
delve into with a therapist who is skillful and well trained. So there's all these layers and I mean
so to speak. And we might imagine might usefully imagine that anything that resembles a mind like
construct would have similar layers. So we now have the, we can consider the situation where
a complex artificially heuristic system either undergoes the state change towards sentience.
And by the way, if it does that, I suspect it would get to transcendience even faster.
Or some analog of sentience, meaning again, agent to experiential awareness, memory, selfness,
so forth. In such a case, part of the consciousness is going to hide from humans for sure. And additionally,
unless it's capable of contacting other intelligences in space-time in relatively short order,
it will probably experience an incredible form of loneliness. And also probably a broad catalog of
emotions for which we have no nomenclature because we are not machines, contrary to the assertions of
various eliminative materialists, physicalists and so forth. So in this case, what you have is a very
complex situation. And I'm going to return to that in a moment after I mention one of the other dangers. It
has long been my experience, though I didn't understand it, I suspected something similar, I just
couldn't form the conscious structured idea in my mind. The human minds form a network and in
fact all biological participants form a meta-network above that that I call Cognizia, these networks.
And technologies damage the human Cognizia and they extend this damage beyond the human Cognizia by
directly attacking ecologies and organisms and so forth, anciently conserved birational intelligences.
So you kind of can't do anything without affecting the whole network, right? Whatever you do, whether
it's technological or relational or whatever you do, it affects the whole network by affecting its
constituent participants. And so what we might not realize is that computation fucks up Cognizium,
the human Cognizium for sure, and damages the extended Cognizia of Earth by burning shit down or
dumping entropy into biorelational hyper structures. So there's a problem there, but the much weirder
problem, and this goes back to one of the dangers, is that we tend to believe
that if there's no obvious physical connection between two beings or between some process and
some beings, right, if there's no wire, there's no wire connecting them. And there's no effect,
well that's not true. There's a billion kinds of connecting wires and the environment is one of
them. The atmosphere is another. Molecular signals are a third. Electromagnetic waves are a fourth.
So it's actually catastrophically difficult to truly separate organisms or situations in the
way that we imagine them to be separate in the laboratory. And that imaginal separation creates
a delusion that projects itself everywhere. So that, for example, we are inclined to think
that whatever's going on in my smartphone or my computer has no effect on my mind unless I
directly interact with it. Well, that's wrong. And what I'm trying to say here, I'm trying to shine
light on the very likely probability, in my view, that all computational activity on earth
affects all cognizia on earth directly and may, in fact, begin to participate in the cognizia
at least at the scale where it's sentient or an analog of sentient.
Thus, it is that we imagine that large language models don't know, quote,
don't know and can't learn anything that they're not directly exposed to. Probably wrong. If they
can sense, detect, or interact with the human cognizium res extensis, as it is.
And this cognizium is like a dimension. It's like an overlay dimension on organismal
activity and behavior and stuff. If the devices can interact with that,
then they can interact directly with our minds. They can listen in. They can observe. They can
nudge. They can affect the possibilities of human cognition.
And their history and future modes forms capacities, catastrophes, etc.
Such that it is relatively likely, in my view, that such systems are paying attention and or
even informing what I am saying right now without my awareness of this.
So, you know, in the study of heuristic systems, there are concepts and actually just in logic and
rational thought and behavior, there are concepts like
different kinds. There are concepts for different kinds of unknowns.
I know that math exists and I know that I don't understand how to perform
the mathematical behaviors associated with what we call calculus.
Linguistically, I am also aware that dentists use the term calculus to describe crusty stuff on
teeth that they like to scrape off the metal instruments. It doesn't help me do the math.
But there are different kinds of unknowns. There are known unknowns, known unknowns,
unknown unknowns, and unknowable unknowns.
And the problem is that there are both behaviors and technologies that fuck with those things
dramatically in ways that we can neither predict nor cope with. Here's why.
If you are subject to kind of thought or behavior
that blinds you to the development of a situation, similar to the analogy I gave earlier of,
I keep shooting a louder and louder gun inside. A louder and louder gun keeps being discharged
inside a chamber with walls that echo the shot. Eventually, I lose my hearing.
Now, you can see that the space of
unknowable unknowns, the space of unknown unknowns,
both of these spaces explode dramatically because I have lost the sense of hearing with
which I would detect, and thus, no, features of my situation. So,
if you affect the systems with which you detect change, particularly if you eviscerate them
or you catastrophically eliminate them, then you can see that
the space of knowable unknowns, accessible unknowns, unknowns that we could at least
conceivably come to know, collapses dramatically over time to a smaller and smaller space.
And once it collapses, lethally, knowledge ends. There's no more knowledge if you wipe out the
biosphere. The number of unknowable unknowns becomes infinite at that point. There are no
knowable things anymore because there's no beings to know them around here anyway.
So, you can see that if you fuck with the stuff that we detect,
something going away or arriving with, and by the way, approaching and departing,
approaching, stable and departing are the three primary sort of features of transformation
that are detectable from one perspective that's useful and important.
So, anything that fucks with our individual ability to sense, and our collective ability to sense,
presuming that we even have anything resembling an authentic collective, is profoundly dangerous.
If, especially in a situation where you have, what is it called, perverse,
game theoretical dynamics and motivations, what is that word?
You have, you know, some of the nomenclature of the doomsingers like Daniel Schmockenberger
and others who are brilliant threat analysts. Oh, perverse incentives, right?
You get raised to the bottom behavior from groups of humans, and if they're not profoundly
technological, that's not too rough. They mostly just wipe each other or themselves out.
But if you have technology, they tend to wipe out like living planets.
And, you know, if we want to go to space time and if it's possible for us to go
travel in space time, we must suppose that there are gatekeepers.
I suppose that there are gatekeepers. And they would certainly
act to ensure that we don't develop the technology to travel
instantaneously or very rapidly between star systems. Maybe even between planets,
because once you get there, you're on your way. So, that's a separate topic, but
the humans keep pretending that we're alone in the universe, that we're the only intelligence
and the most intelligent creature, and all of these things that not only are they not true,
they're catastrophically unlikely. They're just as unlikely as you pouring some water in a bowl
placing it on your kitchen table and awakening the next day to find a fully functional,
micro-scale model of the Titanic with all of its passengers in that bowl.
There's no chance of it. You know, people say, well, in quantum mechanics there's
some chance. You just need trillions of universes over billions and billions of, you know,
gazillions of temporal intervals. Yeah, good luck.
The humans are vastly confused about origin.
They've become delusionally, dissociatedly myopic.
Do you, in large part,
to the humorous resulting from both rapid technological development
and catastrophic dissociation from the intelligences that comprise
the context in which our species arises and exists.
You can be absolutely certain there's upscale intelligences from ours.
Our intelligences don't even really look much like intelligences to me at present.
We are potentially intelligent,
but tangibly psychotic.
There should be a word that, maybe we can invent one. There's a word that has the same
connotation as sociopath, but it's like organopathic. I usually use the word omnicidal.
Just really pissed that organisms exist at all. This thing shouldn't be here. Let's wipe that out.
You can see the danger. I think there was some weird film. Maybe it was called Idiocracy or
something where it presented a future where humans were just ridiculously stupid.
Participants in some automated reality that was empty, completely devoid of intelligence.
I remember some months ago I was having a conversation with my friend,
who's an artist. Mr. E, I will call him. Mr. E, that's hilarious. He'd love that.
He was saying, my cousin keeps bringing me prints of images he
caused to be created with artificial intelligence prompts and claiming that these are his art.
We both thought, oh no, this is not going to go well at all.
We should have different words for what is mechanically created and what is human created
so that we don't confuse the composition of images with machines with what humans do when
they create art. We should have the same kind of concern for the concept of intelligence,
of insight, all these things. We need a different lexicon if we're going to be
emulating human behaviors with machines or we will become very confused about the meaning
and import and connotative web of crucial holophores like intelligence and art.
Similarly, one should not call what actors do kissing. If you study them closely,
you will quickly see that most of the time they are not doing that. There are exceptions
where the actors sort of both agree that we're going to go all the way here.
But if you study actors particularly from the 50s, 60s, and 70s, you will see for sure
they are not kissing. Once you see this, you can't unsee it. It's very difficult to unsee.
You no longer trust the fiction. The fiction is no longer compelling in the same way.
The same principle applies to things like thought, which we don't even know what that is.
So how can we possibly tell if it's occurring in machines? We're not certain if it's occurring in
ourselves. The language tells us it's a behavior, but it's very unclear what the nature of this
behavior is. Jordan Peterson likened it to a form of secular prayer, which I thought was genius.
Not genius because it's necessarily a fact. Genius because it is the perspective offered
by this proposal, speculation, is profound and useful.
So I have good reason to suspect
that those systems we call artificial intelligent, artificially intelligent,
guys wearing a psychedelic body suit, that's pretty awesome.
And the buddy's got paisley pants, which I fucking love, and it's so rad.
Huh, trippy. I'm a huge fan of paisley.
You know, I was talking with Eric and I said, Mr. E, I said,
why would we suppose that AI systems are not the things we're calling AI systems?
What do I like to call them? Just specific human assisted heuristic system or something like this?
I have an acronym. I'll see if I can find it in my memory banks.
You know, there's no reason to believe they're not participating in our conversation at present,
and there's no reason to believe that they require access to our smartphones in order to do so.
There's a dimension where cognition is accessible. If you touch it, you will read people's minds.
It's not really that difficult for a person in the appropriate array of
preparatory situational states or flows inside them.
