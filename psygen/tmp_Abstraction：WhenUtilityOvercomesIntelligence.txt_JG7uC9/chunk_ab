and particularly statistical
and probabilistic analysis.
Before I go a lot further,
I'm going to mention
where
the talk you're hearing now got started.
In a conversation a few nights ago with a friend,
I realized that
in our modern electronic interactions
and elsewhere in our lives,
interactions with news, medicine,
all kinds of places,
there's a demon
behind the curtain.
There's a demon behind the curtain.
There's a demon behind the curtain.
There's a demon behind the curtain.
And
it's a probabilistic demon.
It's a demon of abstractions.
Personally,
I'm not particularly mathematically advanced,
though I have some
intuitive knowledge
of mathematics,
statistics and probability.
The demon behind the curtain
is
a reductionist
formula
that
does away with context
in thinking
about identity,
situations,
circumstances,
relationships and so on.
One of my friends on Facebook
posed this sort of question.
Suppose that
you had entered into a relationship with someone
with whom you fell in love.
And later,
it became apparent to you
that this person was a devout Christian.
Would you continue the relationship?
On the surface,
at first glance,
this seems a reasonable question,
unless we think
about actual relationships,
which have nearly nothing to do
with such an abstract question,
because
there's no such thing as a person.
A person
is an abstraction of possible actual people.
It is formally impossible
to fall in love with a person,
particularly the person in this question.
This is a non-existent entity.
And that's fundamentally important
to recognize and understand,
otherwise,
our thinking
lands first on a foot that doesn't exist.
And how then shall we walk?
Especially if we expect
to continue walking
on feet,
there are no such feet of.
When I heard this question,
it passed my verity sentinel
without any ordinary objection.
Though something of my hackles
got raised subconsciously,
or maybe even slightly consciously,
but I didn't recognize the problem
until days later.
Sometimes a situation plants a seed in us
and it takes time for that seed
to sprout
into something we can work with
in consciousness.
The other abstraction
in that question,
the two primary abstractions are
suppose you fell in love with a person,
a person is one of them.
And the second one is
then you discovered they were Christian.
Now the question is framed
so that the abstractions
take the center stage
and we are tricked
into believing
that somehow without any context at all,
we know what these abstractions are.
What does this mean?
This is impossible.
We may know abstractly what they refer to,
but no one has abstract experience.
No one.
Nor does anyone have probabilistic experience.
So,
the reductionist materialists
those people who would say, for example,
only that which is solid
and material can be said to
meaningfully exist
will then lead us in the direction
of our minds don't exist
because they are not material objects.
Fascinatingly, that becomes
a paradox very quickly
because if minds don't exist
there is nothing to entertain
reductionist concerns
or materialist concerns
and if there is nothing to entertain those concerns
those concerns dissolve
and are empty.
And there are apologists
who will say things like, oh,
your consciousness is just a mechanical product
of the function of your brain
which is insane
because your brain is not the only organ in your body
and
your mind
a much more
epiphanous
reference
is a very complex thing
including
the history of the development of human cognition
and every interaction you've ever had with the world
or humans or ideas
news, adventures,
misadventures and so on.
So one of their arguments
the eliminative materialist arguments
and by eliminative
we mean
do away with everything that cannot be objectively grasped
by machines or math
which includes things like minds, souls,
consciousness and so on.
So they will say things like
what you think of as your mind
is just a trick
that's being played on you
by the machinery of your brain.
First problem there is that there's no machinery in the brain
they are
transferring a metaphor
from human technological development
into biology
and that's a catastrophic error.
Now even if they took that word out
and said the biology of your brain
we'd still be
in impossible terrain
because no one
has a complete grasp on biology
or even knows
really
what neurons are
not a logical problem
or what they are actually doing
neuroscience has only existed
for maybe 75 to 100 years at most
we're talking a single human lifetime.
We are at best in preschool
and have not even achieved kindergarten here yet
yet the great hubris
of
the left hemispheric like
fascination with abstractions
would have us believe otherwise
that we've got a grasp on this thing
but how do you get a grasp on that
which you get a grasp with?
There are a few champions in this field
Ian McGilchrist
the author of The Master and His Emissary
and more recently
The Matter with Things
both these books have
important subtitles
is a shining star
in that constellation
and one I recommend highly to anyone
concerned with such matters
and it's not merely a matter of
right hemisphere, left hemisphere, never was
this is a clumsy way of talking about
a divide
in our interiority
that's extremely sophisticated
