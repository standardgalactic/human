and in which
both
hemispheres
participate ordinarily
though there are circumstances where they do not
such as the water test
where
one of the hemispheres is anesthetized
so that we can effectively
ask questions
and do tests
to see what a lone hemisphere is up to
another situation in which this is possible
is that of a commissurotomy
where
the corpus callosum
that both connects
and disconnects
our superficial brain hemispheres
is severed
in order generally
to prevent
seizures of various kinds
which turn out in this case to be a problem with feedback
between the two hemispheres
certain kinds of activation in hemisphere A
produce echoing activations in hemisphere B
this quickly becomes a rampant process
and epilepsy
attacks and fits of epilepsy result
and there are less severe
kinds of seizure
perhaps ticking
is one of them
Tourette's
maybe having a minor form of seizure
of a specific kind
in any case
to return
to the crux of my question
there are no abstract people
nor are there abstract Christians
each person is an actual person
and in an actual relationship
this question resolves itself
in a much more complex way
than the abstraction of it
can
now some people sort of caught on
in responding to this question
and said
something like
well it would depend on
the person
or the woman or the man
or whatever
but in fact
the question is fundamentally deceptive
for it leads us to believe
we can tell the answer
when
the scope of that answer
decontexted by any actual
relationship
that's what gets done away with
in that question
an actual relationship
to actual people
I'll say actual ten more times really quick
someone who
professes or
enacts Christian
or Christian-like belief systems
and so on
and many of the questions that we face
in daily life are like this
there's some kind of weird hypothetical
question about
a person
who has a railroad switch
in their hand
and they have to choose
between
certainly killing one person
or possibly killing three people
these questions are hypothetical
but none of our experience is hypothetical
except
in thinking
and when we think in abstractions
or if we think in language
we're in great danger
of having dismissed
99%
of what makes us human
maybe my numbers are wrong there
most of what makes us human
and most of what
gives value to our subjectivity
the idea of objectivity
itself is an abstraction
there are precisely zero
objective observers
we certainly cannot be objective observers
that does not mean
that we cannot depart
extreme subjectivity
in the direction
of objectivity
we can do so
and science
takes its fundamental value
from that behavior
now I don't want
people to get confused and think
Darren's taking a dump on science
that's not my intention here
science is valuable
although again these are extreme generalizations here
which science?
what research?
which researchers?
what is done with the research?
when I use the word science
I'm
committing an abstraction
a vast generalization
and while I wouldn't do away with science
or scientific thought
I would ask us to pause at the threshold
of enacting it
and realize the terrifying danger
of equipping societies
as malignant as ours
with the produce
and technologies that emerge
from scientific pursuit
I think that's
fundamentally morally wrong
it's also a betrayal of intelligence
because what we will get
in almost every case
where humans try to solve a problem
with technology is worse problems
that we're not considered
when the technology was
enacted
like the LED lights
more brightness seems good
more abstraction seems good
to something
but not to me
now of course there are
domains
of concern
where objectivity
meaning moving in that direction
and
scientific discovery
are important in liberating
however if we have not developed
societies capable of enacting
these technologies
survivably
not just for us but life on earth
the history and future of it
for all beings
then we're in
an apocalyptic
scale crisis
which of course
the humans of today find ourselves
in
so I was thinking
about how dating apps
ask us abstract questions
often
not all of them
most of them
and we answer these questions
relatively naively
and then other people read these
answers and questions
and think they've learned something about us
but they haven't
because we
are not the answers to these questions
and we are certainly not the abstractions
that emerge
from the questions and their answers
nor do we in any way resemble them
if I have fallen in love with someone
the putative fact of their professed faith
will be interpreted by my love
not my capacity to entertain abstractions
the relationship
is the fundamental
aspect of the situation
not the fact
that it is a person I have fallen in love with
