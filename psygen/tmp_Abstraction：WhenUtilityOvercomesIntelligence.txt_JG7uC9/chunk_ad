or that this person professes
specific religious beliefs
so this was the genesis of my concern
maybe a little wind noise here
my apologies for that
sort of unavoidable
out on a night walk
in San Francisco
under the beautiful moon
which I think
though some moderns are calling it
the worm moon
for reasons I have not explored
is probably the duck moon
or possibly the frog moon
in
blackfoot phonology
though I cannot at the moment
remember the complexly multi-syllable
blackfoot names for these moons
I can almost remember them
so
azzikitsum
bupikitsum
these are probably
the first one is close
that's probably far off
obviously the fragment
or phoneme som
means moon here
yet it's less likely
that it means
the physical object
this is not really its referent
its referent is
the consort of the sun
the being
the moon
not the object
and this is the difference
between
language that places precedence
on beings and relationships
and language that places precedence
on objects and abstractions
earlier when I spoke of exactitude
what I was going to say
was that
we moderns
with our scientific methods
and our mathematics
have determined
precisely the minute
of which day
the moon
is truly full
this is extremely abstract
for indigenous peoples
and each of them have their own
traditions and
ways of knowing and such
the full moon is usually a period
of two to five days
perhaps most often three
they're not concerned with which minute
the moon is at exact fullness
they're concerned with the relationship
and its transformations
in living
not mechanical time
just taking a moment
pause
with the actual moon
appearing as it does to me at the moment
between the ruling
of
what we call telephone wires
in between those rulings
I can almost see the movement of the moon
because I have something against which
to measure that movement
whereas in the free and open sky
that's a very difficult
if not nearly impossible task
and in a way
this is metaphorically
powerful and ironic
given the context
and the topic that I'm entertaining
because it is the capacity to measure things
that tends to produce abstractions
one of the most monumental of which
is money
money is an abstraction of value
value where
what's the context
well money is decontexted value
where value
value is native
to relationships
not abstractions
so money creates
a fake veneer
that is extremely useful to the daimons
of our societies and their institutions
and painfully
inhibitive
and eviscerating
for just about everything else
now I am coming
to the big hill
of my walk
so there will be more huffing and puffing
so let's talk a little bit about statistics
and probabilities
and I'm not an expert
on either of these topics
most of my knowledge
again could be classified as naive
yet I understand
the principles well enough
to speak about
the principles
yet I understand the principles well enough
to speak about them
with some degree of
understanding
statistics have to do with taking measurements
over collections of data
and
for statistics that have to do with humans
these collections are populations
if the population
that is examined
is very small
the relative dependability
of the statistics shrinks
similarly
so that with a cohort of
five to a hundred people
you get statistics that are
nearly useless
with a population of a million people
or a hundred thousand people
you begin to get statistics that have some
degree of relevance to
the object of concern
whatever that may be
the important point here
is that statistics or abstractions
of probability over cohorts
that
is essentially a kind of a fraction
we found this probability
of this event
in a cohort of X size
science relies fundamentally
particularly medical science
on this kind of statistical
and probabilistic analysis
yet again
each human
and each actual situation
has infinite
factors
of novelty involved
so
at the level of populations
the statistics look reliable
and in fact
that kind of abstraction
is relatively reliable
the word relatively here
refers to the size of the cohort
examined
but as we shrink that cohort
down from
a million or a hundred thousand people
to a hundred
or fifty
hearing a frog chorus
and remember I said
this is either the
the duck moon or the frog moon
primarily depends on
in blackfoot phenology
in which moon the raptors begin
setting up for mating
the frog chorus heard me talking
and went silent
ironic since it was their song
I was referring to
and yet
evocative of the truth
for the moment we begin to speak
much of us goes silent
the resources that we have to dedicate
to speaking are very expensive
and so
it creates a situation
