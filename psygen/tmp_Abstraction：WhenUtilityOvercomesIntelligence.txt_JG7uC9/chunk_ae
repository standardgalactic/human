where there's less attention
available to invest in awareness
or sensitivity
visual sight is very similar to this
expensive
biometabolically
so often
if we want to be more sensitive
or if we want to think deeply
we may close our eyes
and thus retrieve
some of those resources
that we can otherwise deploy
this is related to the problem with
abstraction
abstraction
and probability and statistics
have the goal of producing
a form of knowledge
that feels authoritative
and within its scope of concern
understanding the limitation
of such scopes
is
relatively trustworthy
if we preserve our awareness
of the limitations of its scope
and of the common fact
that in order to achieve
this kind of
knowledge
we
have to do away with most of context
we may include some bits
for studying
heart failure
in populations
we can include features
of what we call lifestyle
do people exercise
do they sleep well
do they smoke or drink
are they obese or diabetic
so forth
we can put little pieces of context in there
to help the accuracy
of our predictive
capacities
or our probabilistic models
but largely
abstractions do away with context
and context is the very stuff
of actual specific
always specific
human
experience in existence
so
we should be wary
of the disposal of context
that's not merely common to abstraction
but is the fundamental feature
of abstraction
there are no probabilistic humans
there's no such thing as a person
or a Christian
except in language
of course the question
that was posed hinges
on one's evaluation
of
a depersonated
generalized
idea
the idea of Christianity
and it leverages
or attempts to leverage
the aspect of human minds
and thinking
that is more attached to abstractions
than it is to actual experience
or circumstance or human beings
or relationships
and that's a con game
a very expensive con game
because what gets disposed of with context
is any possibility
of us approaching anything like intelligence
or awareness or understanding
when you throw away the context
you're now in a hypothetical universe
there are no such universes
except in models
and language
and those aren't universes
they're abstractions
descriptions, explanations
models
and humans have made
great
spectacle
of
the functional
value
of statistics and probability
unfortunately what we've done
with most of that
potential
is invested in killing things
including our own minds
our bodies, the world
life on earth
the history and future of life on earth
most of our machines
kill the world 24 seven
and the vast majority of them
profoundly and deeply alter
our capacity for physical, emotional, relational
and biological health
that doesn't look like much of a benefit to me
at all
and some people would
make relatively facile arguments
that well
we've eliminated polio
what about that
not bad
probably not bad
unless we do all of the accounting
and most of the value that we believe
we are trained to believe
by our cultures
and their biases
that has been derived from
mathematical
and probabilistic
development or accomplishment
if we do
even
a reasonably broad accounting
of the repercussions
we find that none of the conveniences
or accomplishments
were economical
in the sense of
what we had to sacrifice to get to them
what we had to sacrifice
or what had to be sacrificed
to the idols
of our
scientific and technological hubris
and by our I simply mean human
again a broad abstraction
for which I will apologize
and which I will acknowledge
there are probably some
modestly reasonable
uses of
this kind of we
the we of all humans
or the we of
those humans that live on earth now
but we
are not the ones who enacted
all of this stuff
what enacted them
were processes that we spawned
that quickly acquired dominance
over our thought expectation
culture
bodies environments
these processes ran rampant
and continue to do so
not merely over humankind
but over
the entire family of life on earth
and its history
and its future
some people will think
well you can't damage history
it already happened
yes you can damage history
you can damage history
by fucking up the future
if we do something
so terrible
that all of history is ashamed of us
human and non
then we fucked up history
if humans obliterate
the living environment
the biosphere
or the atmosphere
then we fucked up history
because we've determined
by our actions
that that is what history becomes
similarly if we do something
so incredibly beautiful
that every life form on earth
or even many of them
