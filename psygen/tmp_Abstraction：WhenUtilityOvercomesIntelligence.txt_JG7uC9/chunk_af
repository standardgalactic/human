would be
would feel celebratory
about
the change we've affected
our ancestors would be
ecstatic
the forests and oceans and mountains
would be
cheering in their roots
then again we have changed history
because we cause
we had a causal role
in that history leading to something beautiful
and worthy
not only of our humanity
but our organismal nature
and our shared
environment with all beings
and all of life on earth
historically historical
and
futurial
so I'm asking
in my talk tonight
that we become aware
when we or others
or machines or anyone
starts to speak abstractly
about things that are fundamentally meaningful
like relationships
that we have a
that we spawn a little process
that watches over
the use of language
and metaphor
and analogy and rhetoric
to alert us
when context has been disposed of
so that we can pause
at that precipice
and in our minds
reintroduce context
and become aware
of the staggering limitations
of the useful or appropriate scope
of such activity
and thus preserve the precedence
of all that was not there
included
when faced with a gambit like this
preserving the precedence
of the unknown
of the relational
of the subjective
the experiential
the somatic
the biological
the organismal
the essential
and all of this
and keeping the precedence there
while entertaining
the abstractions
only in those ways
that they are actually trustworthy
or useful
this is the great medicine
that I would like us to develop together
and share in
and experience the benefits of
more and more our lives
are dominated
by abstract processes
within the functions
and institutions of our societies
our languages
our sciences
and
this
represents
a vastly
horrifying and unjustifiable
array
of amputations and circumcisions
our children
and our forebears
are crying out to us
from their futures
and their graves
to amend
this terrible cascade
of wrongdoing
become so ordinary
to us in our common experience
as to seem
both expected
and trivial
of course everyone drives cars
of course your life depends upon money
and your capacity to make it
of course
probabilities tell us what things are and do
of course we should
exchange the abstract
and the seemingly objective
for
the personal
the actual
the essential
the primordial
and let's do that faster
and in more ways each moment
because
well that's the direction everything goes
well it's not the direction I go
and perhaps you will decide
that it's not the direction you will go
and perhaps we can forge a direction
worth actually going in together
with and for each other
and the history
and future
of life on earth and all beings
thank you for joining me
I look forward to learning together
again
very soon
bye bye for now
