Hello everybody. Welcome.
I'm going out for a walk this evening underneath the very nearly full moon.
From what I've been able to understand, we moderns are a little bit peculiar
in terms of our devotion to exactitude.
And that topic turns out to be useful tonight,
since it's my intention to discuss
problems with abstraction and abstract knowledge
and abstract thinking.
I think this is harmonious with many of my previous videos,
recent videos.
Although in many of those videos, I was discussing problems with the intellect.
Most of those problems arise
when we take the derivations of intellect to be authoritative.
I have a little forest of concerns,
and it's a little bit windy this evening.
So, because I'd like to make a video tonight,
I'm going to risk a little bit of wind noise
and possibly some hood noise,
since my mic is inside my hood.
Earlier today,
I was listening to a podcast on the Mandukya Upanishad.
I can't recall the name of the Swami who was lecturing,
but I find his lectures enjoyable and intelligent and enlightening.
And I think that if he and I got to have some conversations, it would be a lot of fun.
And we could learn a lot together.
But it's also fun to just listen to him.
In the city,
where I am at the moment,
there's a lot of events per moment going on,
particularly when I'm on a busy street,
as I am now.
Though even on a busy street,
there are intervals of calm.
I often notice living in the city,
particularly if I'm in my room,
that the pace of noise
undergoes transformations throughout the day,
increasing and departing a bit like waves on the ocean.
But I've also noticed that
throughout the day,
if one's awareness is keen,
it becomes apparent that there are
little spans
of something approaching silence.
And silence is extremely important for us,
for our health and well-being,
in the same way that darkness is extremely important for our health and well-being.
And for we who live in cities,
these are extremely rare.
Far less common now that where I live,
LED streetlights have been introduced.
And they are terrifyingly bright.
Which is something I find,
both oppressive
and intrusive and uncomfortable.
A more significant problem
with many of these lights
is they produce a very disturbing kind of shadow.
As they shine through the lights of trees
onto the sidewalk,
it's a sort of digitized shadow.
And instead of producing a single shadow,
like the lights that I'm used to,
produces multiple versions of the same shadow
in a pattern I also find quite disturbing.
I'm walking up some hills,
so I'm going to be huffing and puffing a bit.
All of us have various concerns
with what is done and not done in our societies,
what is taken into consideration
or ignored.
And in the street lamp problem,
a lot of important things were ignored
and many other important things weren't taken into consideration.
But when we ask who did the ignoring,
we face a more complicated problem
because the who in this question
is the whole.
It's an abstraction.
There wasn't a person
really involved in making these decisions,
though humans proposed and planned,
analyzed and paid for them.
What's making these decisions isn't a being.
It's something that more closely resembles
a demon or a daemon process.
As I've discussed in recent recordings,
what we think of as our societies
are really just a tangled mess
of largely antiquated,
bizarre, opportunistic
and ignorant processes.
And some people think when they say the word
the government,
they seem to think they're referring to people.
And certainly,
the government is peopled by humans.
But the processes that drive those humans aren't human
and the structure within which those people function
is not only inhuman and dehumanizing,
it's aggressively malignant.
We live in a world where brighter is better
and that's dangerous for animals and organisms like us
because certain kinds of light harm us
and some of those kinds of light harm us severely.
And some of the things we do with light,
using a universal we here, that's not real,
some of the things that are done
by our societies and their sub-functions with light
are terrifyingly wrong
and represent severe injustices.
I'm a person who enjoys walking in darkness
and when one walks in darkness,
over a period of about 20 minutes,
our eyes adjust.
And so,
the precedence in our vision switches from the foveal to the peripheral
and unless it's entirely pitch black,
we can see.
Not as good as an owl or a cat
or perhaps a mouse or a bat,
but what is meant by vision in bats is a rather complicated thing.
But
another machine that's undergone a similar transformation
relatively recently is the automobile
and the lights on automobiles these days are terrifically blinding
to anyone they're shining on,
including drivers in the other lane.
This makes it both dangerous and painful
for people who are older,
whose vision is more severely affected by that brightness
and who are more easily blinded.
But there's a different kind of vision problem.
A vision problem in our thinking
where the extreme apparent brightness
of abstractions
overwhelms the intelligences
that might otherwise be informed by them,
replacing insight with ignorance
understanding with declarations
and knowledge with abstractions.
Now, whatever is meant by knowledge must be a very complex thing
and so it is true with seeing and intelligence
and each of these simple words
that I've chosen
are the words
that I've chosen to use as pointers towards something
and it would be didactic
if I were to too carefully define them.
Nonetheless,
it falls on me to
take some time
and shed
the light of understanding
on some of these terms.
Each of which I think of as
having many features and changing
the meaning of which change under
different circumstances
and in different conversations
or listeners or people.
The onset of the human capacity
to introduce to awareness
probabilistic thought,
statistical thought,
like many of our modern
quote-unquote accomplishments
brought with it an unexpected zoo
of monsters.
In science,
for example,
there's a principle that's often referred to
as objectivity.
Often this comes down
to
a rather clumsy mode
of materialist
ontology and epistemology,
ontology being
the philosophical
concern with identity,
what things are
and epistemology being
the philosophical concern with how things are
and how we know what things are
or how we know other things
and whether or not
our knowledge is justified, true, etc.
And as these features were introduced
to human cognition
and of course they're not brand new,
humans have probably been doing something
that we refer to as playing games of chance
for thousands of years.
But it was long after the introduction
of such games
that the capacity to think about them
systematically arose
with the onset
of mathematical advancement
and particularly statistical
and probabilistic analysis.
Before I go a lot further,
I'm going to mention
where
the talk you're hearing now got started.
In a conversation a few nights ago with a friend,
I realized that
in our modern electronic interactions
and elsewhere in our lives,
interactions with news, medicine,
all kinds of places,
there's a demon
behind the curtain.
There's a demon behind the curtain.
There's a demon behind the curtain.
There's a demon behind the curtain.
And
it's a probabilistic demon.
It's a demon of abstractions.
Personally,
I'm not particularly mathematically advanced,
though I have some
intuitive knowledge
of mathematics,
statistics and probability.
The demon behind the curtain
is
a reductionist
formula
that
does away with context
in thinking
about identity,
situations,
circumstances,
relationships and so on.
One of my friends on Facebook
posed this sort of question.
Suppose that
you had entered into a relationship with someone
with whom you fell in love.
And later,
it became apparent to you
that this person was a devout Christian.
Would you continue the relationship?
On the surface,
at first glance,
this seems a reasonable question,
unless we think
about actual relationships,
which have nearly nothing to do
with such an abstract question,
because
there's no such thing as a person.
A person
is an abstraction of possible actual people.
It is formally impossible
to fall in love with a person,
particularly the person in this question.
This is a non-existent entity.
And that's fundamentally important
to recognize and understand,
otherwise,
our thinking
lands first on a foot that doesn't exist.
And how then shall we walk?
Especially if we expect
to continue walking
on feet,
there are no such feet of.
When I heard this question,
it passed my verity sentinel
without any ordinary objection.
Though something of my hackles
got raised subconsciously,
or maybe even slightly consciously,
but I didn't recognize the problem
until days later.
Sometimes a situation plants a seed in us
and it takes time for that seed
to sprout
into something we can work with
in consciousness.
The other abstraction
in that question,
the two primary abstractions are
suppose you fell in love with a person,
a person is one of them.
And the second one is
then you discovered they were Christian.
Now the question is framed
so that the abstractions
take the center stage
and we are tricked
into believing
that somehow without any context at all,
we know what these abstractions are.
What does this mean?
This is impossible.
We may know abstractly what they refer to,
but no one has abstract experience.
No one.
Nor does anyone have probabilistic experience.
So,
the reductionist materialists
those people who would say, for example,
only that which is solid
and material can be said to
meaningfully exist
will then lead us in the direction
of our minds don't exist
because they are not material objects.
Fascinatingly, that becomes
a paradox very quickly
because if minds don't exist
there is nothing to entertain
reductionist concerns
or materialist concerns
and if there is nothing to entertain those concerns
those concerns dissolve
and are empty.
And there are apologists
who will say things like, oh,
your consciousness is just a mechanical product
of the function of your brain
which is insane
because your brain is not the only organ in your body
and
your mind
a much more
epiphanous
reference
is a very complex thing
including
the history of the development of human cognition
and every interaction you've ever had with the world
or humans or ideas
news, adventures,
misadventures and so on.
So one of their arguments
the eliminative materialist arguments
and by eliminative
we mean
do away with everything that cannot be objectively grasped
by machines or math
which includes things like minds, souls,
consciousness and so on.
So they will say things like
what you think of as your mind
is just a trick
that's being played on you
by the machinery of your brain.
First problem there is that there's no machinery in the brain
they are
transferring a metaphor
from human technological development
into biology
and that's a catastrophic error.
Now even if they took that word out
and said the biology of your brain
we'd still be
in impossible terrain
because no one
has a complete grasp on biology
or even knows
really
what neurons are
not a logical problem
or what they are actually doing
neuroscience has only existed
for maybe 75 to 100 years at most
we're talking a single human lifetime.
We are at best in preschool
and have not even achieved kindergarten here yet
yet the great hubris
of
the left hemispheric like
fascination with abstractions
would have us believe otherwise
that we've got a grasp on this thing
but how do you get a grasp on that
which you get a grasp with?
There are a few champions in this field
Ian McGilchrist
the author of The Master and His Emissary
and more recently
The Matter with Things
both these books have
important subtitles
is a shining star
in that constellation
and one I recommend highly to anyone
concerned with such matters
and it's not merely a matter of
right hemisphere, left hemisphere, never was
this is a clumsy way of talking about
a divide
in our interiority
that's extremely sophisticated
and in which
both
hemispheres
participate ordinarily
though there are circumstances where they do not
such as the water test
where
one of the hemispheres is anesthetized
so that we can effectively
ask questions
and do tests
to see what a lone hemisphere is up to
another situation in which this is possible
is that of a commissurotomy
where
the corpus callosum
that both connects
and disconnects
our superficial brain hemispheres
is severed
in order generally
to prevent
seizures of various kinds
which turn out in this case to be a problem with feedback
between the two hemispheres
certain kinds of activation in hemisphere A
produce echoing activations in hemisphere B
this quickly becomes a rampant process
and epilepsy
attacks and fits of epilepsy result
and there are less severe
kinds of seizure
perhaps ticking
is one of them
Tourette's
maybe having a minor form of seizure
of a specific kind
in any case
to return
to the crux of my question
there are no abstract people
nor are there abstract Christians
each person is an actual person
and in an actual relationship
this question resolves itself
in a much more complex way
than the abstraction of it
can
now some people sort of caught on
in responding to this question
and said
something like
well it would depend on
the person
or the woman or the man
or whatever
but in fact
the question is fundamentally deceptive
for it leads us to believe
we can tell the answer
when
the scope of that answer
decontexted by any actual
relationship
that's what gets done away with
in that question
an actual relationship
to actual people
I'll say actual ten more times really quick
someone who
professes or
enacts Christian
or Christian-like belief systems
and so on
and many of the questions that we face
in daily life are like this
there's some kind of weird hypothetical
question about
a person
who has a railroad switch
in their hand
and they have to choose
between
certainly killing one person
or possibly killing three people
these questions are hypothetical
but none of our experience is hypothetical
except
in thinking
and when we think in abstractions
or if we think in language
we're in great danger
of having dismissed
99%
of what makes us human
maybe my numbers are wrong there
most of what makes us human
and most of what
gives value to our subjectivity
the idea of objectivity
itself is an abstraction
there are precisely zero
objective observers
we certainly cannot be objective observers
that does not mean
that we cannot depart
extreme subjectivity
in the direction
of objectivity
we can do so
and science
takes its fundamental value
from that behavior
now I don't want
people to get confused and think
Darren's taking a dump on science
that's not my intention here
science is valuable
although again these are extreme generalizations here
which science?
what research?
which researchers?
what is done with the research?
when I use the word science
I'm
committing an abstraction
a vast generalization
and while I wouldn't do away with science
or scientific thought
I would ask us to pause at the threshold
of enacting it
and realize the terrifying danger
of equipping societies
as malignant as ours
with the produce
and technologies that emerge
from scientific pursuit
I think that's
fundamentally morally wrong
it's also a betrayal of intelligence
because what we will get
in almost every case
where humans try to solve a problem
with technology is worse problems
that we're not considered
when the technology was
enacted
like the LED lights
more brightness seems good
more abstraction seems good
to something
but not to me
now of course there are
domains
of concern
where objectivity
meaning moving in that direction
and
scientific discovery
are important in liberating
however if we have not developed
societies capable of enacting
these technologies
survivably
not just for us but life on earth
the history and future of it
for all beings
then we're in
an apocalyptic
scale crisis
which of course
the humans of today find ourselves
in
so I was thinking
about how dating apps
ask us abstract questions
often
not all of them
most of them
and we answer these questions
relatively naively
and then other people read these
answers and questions
and think they've learned something about us
but they haven't
because we
are not the answers to these questions
and we are certainly not the abstractions
that emerge
from the questions and their answers
nor do we in any way resemble them
if I have fallen in love with someone
the putative fact of their professed faith
will be interpreted by my love
not my capacity to entertain abstractions
the relationship
is the fundamental
aspect of the situation
not the fact
that it is a person I have fallen in love with
or that this person professes
specific religious beliefs
so this was the genesis of my concern
maybe a little wind noise here
my apologies for that
sort of unavoidable
out on a night walk
in San Francisco
under the beautiful moon
which I think
though some moderns are calling it
the worm moon
for reasons I have not explored
is probably the duck moon
or possibly the frog moon
in
blackfoot phonology
though I cannot at the moment
remember the complexly multi-syllable
blackfoot names for these moons
I can almost remember them
so
azzikitsum
bupikitsum
these are probably
the first one is close
that's probably far off
obviously the fragment
or phoneme som
means moon here
yet it's less likely
that it means
the physical object
this is not really its referent
its referent is
the consort of the sun
the being
the moon
not the object
and this is the difference
between
language that places precedence
on beings and relationships
and language that places precedence
on objects and abstractions
earlier when I spoke of exactitude
what I was going to say
was that
we moderns
with our scientific methods
and our mathematics
have determined
precisely the minute
of which day
the moon
is truly full
this is extremely abstract
for indigenous peoples
and each of them have their own
traditions and
ways of knowing and such
the full moon is usually a period
of two to five days
perhaps most often three
they're not concerned with which minute
the moon is at exact fullness
they're concerned with the relationship
and its transformations
in living
not mechanical time
just taking a moment
pause
with the actual moon
appearing as it does to me at the moment
between the ruling
of
what we call telephone wires
in between those rulings
I can almost see the movement of the moon
because I have something against which
to measure that movement
whereas in the free and open sky
that's a very difficult
if not nearly impossible task
and in a way
this is metaphorically
powerful and ironic
given the context
and the topic that I'm entertaining
because it is the capacity to measure things
that tends to produce abstractions
one of the most monumental of which
is money
money is an abstraction of value
value where
what's the context
well money is decontexted value
where value
value is native
to relationships
not abstractions
so money creates
a fake veneer
that is extremely useful to the daimons
of our societies and their institutions
and painfully
inhibitive
and eviscerating
for just about everything else
now I am coming
to the big hill
of my walk
so there will be more huffing and puffing
so let's talk a little bit about statistics
and probabilities
and I'm not an expert
on either of these topics
most of my knowledge
again could be classified as naive
yet I understand
the principles well enough
to speak about
the principles
yet I understand the principles well enough
to speak about them
with some degree of
understanding
statistics have to do with taking measurements
over collections of data
and
for statistics that have to do with humans
these collections are populations
if the population
that is examined
is very small
the relative dependability
of the statistics shrinks
similarly
so that with a cohort of
five to a hundred people
you get statistics that are
nearly useless
with a population of a million people
or a hundred thousand people
you begin to get statistics that have some
degree of relevance to
the object of concern
whatever that may be
the important point here
is that statistics or abstractions
of probability over cohorts
that
is essentially a kind of a fraction
we found this probability
of this event
in a cohort of X size
science relies fundamentally
particularly medical science
on this kind of statistical
and probabilistic analysis
yet again
each human
and each actual situation
has infinite
factors
of novelty involved
so
at the level of populations
the statistics look reliable
and in fact
that kind of abstraction
is relatively reliable
the word relatively here
refers to the size of the cohort
examined
but as we shrink that cohort
down from
a million or a hundred thousand people
to a hundred
or fifty
hearing a frog chorus
and remember I said
this is either the
the duck moon or the frog moon
primarily depends on
in blackfoot phenology
in which moon the raptors begin
setting up for mating
the frog chorus heard me talking
and went silent
ironic since it was their song
I was referring to
and yet
evocative of the truth
for the moment we begin to speak
much of us goes silent
the resources that we have to dedicate
to speaking are very expensive
and so
it creates a situation
where there's less attention
available to invest in awareness
or sensitivity
visual sight is very similar to this
expensive
biometabolically
so often
if we want to be more sensitive
or if we want to think deeply
we may close our eyes
and thus retrieve
some of those resources
that we can otherwise deploy
this is related to the problem with
abstraction
abstraction
and probability and statistics
have the goal of producing
a form of knowledge
that feels authoritative
and within its scope of concern
understanding the limitation
of such scopes
is
relatively trustworthy
if we preserve our awareness
of the limitations of its scope
and of the common fact
that in order to achieve
this kind of
knowledge
we
have to do away with most of context
we may include some bits
for studying
heart failure
in populations
we can include features
of what we call lifestyle
do people exercise
do they sleep well
do they smoke or drink
are they obese or diabetic
so forth
we can put little pieces of context in there
to help the accuracy
of our predictive
capacities
or our probabilistic models
but largely
abstractions do away with context
and context is the very stuff
of actual specific
always specific
human
experience in existence
so
we should be wary
of the disposal of context
that's not merely common to abstraction
but is the fundamental feature
of abstraction
there are no probabilistic humans
there's no such thing as a person
or a Christian
except in language
of course the question
that was posed hinges
on one's evaluation
of
a depersonated
generalized
idea
the idea of Christianity
and it leverages
or attempts to leverage
the aspect of human minds
and thinking
that is more attached to abstractions
than it is to actual experience
or circumstance or human beings
or relationships
and that's a con game
a very expensive con game
because what gets disposed of with context
is any possibility
of us approaching anything like intelligence
or awareness or understanding
when you throw away the context
you're now in a hypothetical universe
there are no such universes
except in models
and language
and those aren't universes
they're abstractions
descriptions, explanations
models
and humans have made
great
spectacle
of
the functional
value
of statistics and probability
unfortunately what we've done
with most of that
potential
is invested in killing things
including our own minds
our bodies, the world
life on earth
the history and future of life on earth
most of our machines
kill the world 24 seven
and the vast majority of them
profoundly and deeply alter
our capacity for physical, emotional, relational
and biological health
that doesn't look like much of a benefit to me
at all
and some people would
make relatively facile arguments
that well
we've eliminated polio
what about that
not bad
probably not bad
unless we do all of the accounting
and most of the value that we believe
we are trained to believe
by our cultures
and their biases
that has been derived from
mathematical
and probabilistic
development or accomplishment
if we do
even
a reasonably broad accounting
of the repercussions
we find that none of the conveniences
or accomplishments
were economical
in the sense of
what we had to sacrifice to get to them
what we had to sacrifice
or what had to be sacrificed
to the idols
of our
scientific and technological hubris
and by our I simply mean human
again a broad abstraction
for which I will apologize
and which I will acknowledge
there are probably some
modestly reasonable
uses of
this kind of we
the we of all humans
or the we of
those humans that live on earth now
but we
are not the ones who enacted
all of this stuff
what enacted them
were processes that we spawned
that quickly acquired dominance
over our thought expectation
culture
bodies environments
these processes ran rampant
and continue to do so
not merely over humankind
but over
the entire family of life on earth
and its history
and its future
some people will think
well you can't damage history
it already happened
yes you can damage history
you can damage history
by fucking up the future
if we do something
so terrible
that all of history is ashamed of us
human and non
then we fucked up history
if humans obliterate
the living environment
the biosphere
or the atmosphere
then we fucked up history
because we've determined
by our actions
that that is what history becomes
similarly if we do something
so incredibly beautiful
that every life form on earth
or even many of them
would be
would feel celebratory
about
the change we've affected
our ancestors would be
ecstatic
the forests and oceans and mountains
would be
cheering in their roots
then again we have changed history
because we cause
we had a causal role
in that history leading to something beautiful
and worthy
not only of our humanity
but our organismal nature
and our shared
environment with all beings
and all of life on earth
historically historical
and
futurial
so I'm asking
in my talk tonight
that we become aware
when we or others
or machines or anyone
starts to speak abstractly
about things that are fundamentally meaningful
like relationships
that we have a
that we spawn a little process
that watches over
the use of language
and metaphor
and analogy and rhetoric
to alert us
when context has been disposed of
so that we can pause
at that precipice
and in our minds
reintroduce context
and become aware
of the staggering limitations
of the useful or appropriate scope
of such activity
and thus preserve the precedence
of all that was not there
included
when faced with a gambit like this
preserving the precedence
of the unknown
of the relational
of the subjective
the experiential
the somatic
the biological
the organismal
the essential
and all of this
and keeping the precedence there
while entertaining
the abstractions
only in those ways
that they are actually trustworthy
or useful
this is the great medicine
that I would like us to develop together
and share in
and experience the benefits of
more and more our lives
are dominated
by abstract processes
within the functions
and institutions of our societies
our languages
our sciences
and
this
represents
a vastly
horrifying and unjustifiable
array
of amputations and circumcisions
our children
and our forebears
are crying out to us
from their futures
and their graves
to amend
this terrible cascade
of wrongdoing
become so ordinary
to us in our common experience
as to seem
both expected
and trivial
of course everyone drives cars
of course your life depends upon money
and your capacity to make it
of course
probabilities tell us what things are and do
of course we should
exchange the abstract
and the seemingly objective
for
the personal
the actual
the essential
the primordial
and let's do that faster
and in more ways each moment
because
well that's the direction everything goes
well it's not the direction I go
and perhaps you will decide
that it's not the direction you will go
and perhaps we can forge a direction
worth actually going in together
with and for each other
and the history
and future
of life on earth and all beings
thank you for joining me
I look forward to learning together
again
very soon
bye bye for now
