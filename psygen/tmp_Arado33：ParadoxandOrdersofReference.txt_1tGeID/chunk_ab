And this is a really interesting and provocative problem here, because there's a solution
that's quite fascinating, and it's been partially formalized by others, I have my own preferred
formalization, which I'll share with you in a moment, and it may have evolved, I don't
know if this is the best one, but it's got some astonishing properties, this little
formalization, so the formalization goes like this, it is a correction that both declares
the problem posed by the Liar's Paradox and solves it, it goes like this, it sounds a
little complex but follow through with me, no statement shall, by self reference, promote
itself to the order of statements, whereby it must be interpreted.
Now this is a really peculiar construct.
What it implies is that there is, what we might understand, there are two orders of
our relationship with language, one is kind of the maker, author, understander order and
the other is the declarative, denotative product order.
And so you can't in the sentence tell the order that would normally interpret language
what to do in the second order in the product, so you can't tell the process what to do in
the finished product is the gist of this little correction.
But this has a really fascinating property, so what we discover is that Liar's Paradox
has collapsed the interpretation order into the declaration order, so that it lost a dimension
again, right?
And in fact it lost dimensionality, it lost the whole interpretive mind, it's been somehow
crushed down into the language where it can't exist, and that's the nature of this Paradox
and it's a fascinating and brilliantly useful toy to see something that's otherwise almost
impossible to see, which is specifically that these two orders must never collapse and when
they do catastrophe emerges.
The statement, no statement shall by self-reference promote itself to the order of statements
whereby it must be interpreted is a fascinating reply for a number of interesting reasons.
It shows the structure of the problem of the Liar Paradox, it shows that it's violating
an aspect of the structure of language that's normally invisible but must never be violated,
and that's amazing by itself, but it has another really peculiar quality, it's self-violating
to say the statement as I said it violates the admonition, it violates the directions
that that statement demand to not be violated, it's a self-violating statement that solves
a paradox, and by this we can discover something very peculiar about language.
One kind of violation creates a sort of infinite loop of blindness, and this is a violation
that causes a collapse of two orders into what would usually be the product, right?
But another kind of statement by violating its own structure returns a clear awareness
of the proper structure, solves the paradox, it's as if there are two polarities of violation,
one of them deprives of insight and intelligence, as mind collapses into words and their derivatives,
and so there's no more interpretive order above listening and determining and watching,
it's all done in the language, no interpretive order.
So when the interpretive order collapses into the derivatives, into the words, you've got
a catastrophe, but there's a way to create a violation, a self-violating reply that restores
both our capacity to see the problem and tells us how to avoid it, fascinatingly, to do this
we must use a self-violating statement, so you see the statement that I made does what
it tells us not to do, right, so it promotes itself to the order of statements whereby
it itself must be interpreted, and that would seem impossible.
I think you'll find if you play with some of the ideas, which may at first seem a little
sophisticated here, you will discover that language has startlingly unusual properties
and that they are, although they are sophisticated, they're not beyond our grasp if we have ways
to approach and play with them that don't necessarily require a sophisticated skill,
but take advantage of our fascination and our long exposure and questions about language
to draw us back into the dialogue of discovery with each other and language, the history
of language and the struggles of our species, both with language and representational intelligence
in general.
It is a paradox itself that the animal that has formalized concepts and formal representational
skills has been nearly unable to educate themselves about the real potentials and dangers of what
might be the most fundamental technology we possess.
It is the one with which we are least advanced, and any even small advancement will give us
a chance at forming new kinds of collectives, new modes of human intelligence, and perhaps
returning the common experience of prodigy to each other, our cultures, our children,
and what we are presently calling education.
