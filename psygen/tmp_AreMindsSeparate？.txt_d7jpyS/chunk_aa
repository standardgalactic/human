Hello everybody. I'm out for a morning walk and there may be a little mic noise
and a little traffic noise but we'll do our best. So all of our models I was just
listening to Lex Fridman podcast on free will and forgive me for not
recalling the name of his guest a woman researcher and they began to talk about
suffering and the researcher posited that suffering and memory are
inextricably intertwined and this is interesting and their conversations
interesting even though I have problems with various parts of it but I want to
pose a very fundamental question our minds distinct and if so to what degree
are they explicitly distinct the way we pretend they are by pretending that my
mind is known only to me inside my skin and this is a clinical perspective from
a certain angle but it's also a philosophical perspective which means
it's a perspective that exists only if we admit certain assumptions or axioms
and if we validate those axioms then the resulting model in our thought
creates a boundary somewhere maybe at the surface of the skin maybe beyond that
slightly maybe within that slightly at which the local mind is expected to
cease right doesn't pass that boundary and everything about my human
experience and the experience that I have of being more than human which
frankly is most of my experience because if I had to accept only the definitions
of my humanity as they're commonly proposed and promulgated and scripted
in culture I would be a much more limited being than I have experience of
being of course this depends on our definition of human and how broad or
narrow it is and in what ways it is broader narrow but I've always felt
that the definitions are extremely primitive and they're primitive in
bizarre ways that have advanced in their primitivity as our technologies have
advanced in other words as we become a more technological species our ideas
about what it means to be human have dwindled to some very limiting and
confused perspectives so first I'm going to argue that most of what we are is
more than merely human a common argument for this if we're if we're going to be
somewhat scientific is that approximately half of our cells are
bacterial and those cells don't come from our human gene line which means at
least half of our body human though it appears at the boundary is within itself
not human we could imagine the bacterial hyper structures are less than human but
that seems unlikely since we can't be human without them
but let's think about minds is there any such thing as a mind that we could call
human that exists and develops in isolation no such things there are
precisely zero entirely isolated organisms at the very least they are
connected by belonging to the biosphere in the same way that sets and members are
connected and in a way I would argue that resembles how organs and bodies are
connected and I think the idea of connection is actually backwards
organisms appear to form vast relational hyper structures over time first and
foremost and in comparison their apparent individuality can be seen as
relatively trivial and it is useful to see it as relatively trivial so
it looks to me like the opposite of what we think is more like what's going on
and maybe dramatically more like what's going on you can see that in our
technologies we keep attempting to build representations of connections as if
we're trying to fill in a space that has been imagined to be missing but never
was empty of signals relationships developmental opportunism neg entropy
and all kinds of important things many of which we don't even have concepts for
let alone words about and this seems to be a tragic feature of our modernity to
me that we think and believe as if minds are fundamentally separate and we
treat them as separate and think that we are connecting them with signals across
wires now it's not untrue but what I'm proposing is that before we had the
wires we had better connections before we had radio we had something like
telepathy before we had telephones we had something like telepathy and it was
much more common in our experience precisely because there were no
representations no mechanical representations of this intrinsic
symbiotic union of all beings in all of time and various smaller cohorts the
beings in present time with us on earth now and so on to a smaller cohort as we
like to people we don't develop technologies out of thin air the way
that we imagine this process to occur often what happens is a relational
behavioral biological and perhaps even transcendental situation is replaced
by a representation of it so that we get television as a replacement for group
dreaming I'm going to take a brief break here and I will return shortly when my
errand has proceeded a bit our intuitions about the distinctness the
separateness of organisms and minds don't come to us from nature they come to
us from culture language concept ideology and some people will say of course
anyone can say anything but some people will say well there's no proof that
there's something resembling telepathy and that may or may not be true depending
on what the standards of proof are and what the experiments that were performed
are who performed them what they were looking for and so on I've certainly had
direct experience of things events situations that cannot be other than
telepathic or rather again I think we've started the whole game from the wrong
side of concern and perception I think we have minds because there are billions
of organisms on earth that create a field effect in which minds naturally arise
as an emergent property of the field of biology on earth and that field may have
elements that are not that are engaged in time in nonlinear ways thus it is
possible to know something of the future and this is true even in our
representational behavior concern and so on we call the clinical concern with
futures different kinds of things in different contexts physics will tell us
the application of physics will tell us something of what to expect if a ball is
thrown and for more complex futures we have the study of probabilities which
very strangely and I think importantly can tell us fascinating and useful things
about cohorts or groups but very little if anything useful about what we think of
as individuals what if there are no individuals there's certainly no example
of an absolute individual all of the forms of life we see every instance of a
mind that we will ever encounter is an emergent embodiment and inaction of
characteristics hidden deep in not merely the relationships of the moment but
the entire history of life on earth
you can imagine that every organism that we can discern as distinct is a thread
and if we follow that thread back to its proximal origin its most proximal
origin we will find either a progenitor a pair of progenitors or a group of
progenitors and so you can see that with very few exceptions there aren't any
organisms that are alone that emerge alone live and die alone and in fact in
order to be clinical about biology and organisms we have to work very hard to
separate out all the other relationships so that we can control for them in
order to learn something very mechanically specific about a given
form of organism a specific organism or a cohort of them now some people might
be inclined to dismiss my anecdotal propositions or even declarations that
telepathy actually underlies just about everything but even if there's all kinds
of problems here that we don't ordinarily consider one of them is how
organisms hitchhike on each other and synchronize together to spread the
benefit of effort work done so on so that in a wing of Canadian geese each bird
is supported by the other birds and they switch positions within the wing
according to a vast array of variables that are all relational variables and
their variables of sensing of group behavior of symbiotic behavior and so
again I think it's backwards to start at the individual and then try to figure
out if it's connected to other things other beings other minds without other
minds there are no minds right all of our minds arose in a field of highly
structured human behavior much of which is representational but not all of which
is formally representational I think our ideas about the supernatural are wrong
but they're not wrong because nothing like these ideas exists they're wrong
because they're too simplistic the idea of telepathy for example begins with the
proposition that minds are fundamentally separate and don't ordinarily connect
except along those signal paths that we have already discovered delineated
described and are aware of that's not possibly true it's not possible for that
to be true that would suppose that we discovered all the ways that minds
connect to each other that will never happen that's an impossible goal so
it's certainly a fact that the limited ideas that we have about connection are
false to facts in nature so what I'm proposing here is that we've really got
the entire idea quite backwards that the nature of life on earth is fundamentally
transcendent it's more than sentient and not in some AI funded way in a
biorelational in a vast manifold of biorelational ways that have been busy
being themselves for as long as there's been life on earth and probably before
that and this brings us to the question of you know what's the nature of time
space and we ask questions like well could the universe be conscious but
what if the universe is something transcendental to consciousness that
produces consciousness as a mere side effect of its activities in these
domains that we have yet to form intelligent ideas of around and I would
say that this is by far the more likely situation the human concern with
utility and with mechanization and automation blinds us to most of what's
going on that can't be captured that way now I have had experiences where I know
for a fact that my mind was touching a distant mind without any ordinary
signaling apparatus operating between us for as an example at the moment of my
grandmother's death I had an elaborate dream involving her a musical dream a
beautiful dream and there was nothing connecting us except the fact that my
mother's body was an organ in her body long ago before it became a distinct
quote individual in the world and so to my body in my mother's body and so on
there's we're missing out on the vast library of features that biology clearly
is engaged in producing sustaining developing transforming over time and
part of the reason we're confused in general is because we have the wrong
idea about separation we think that separation means something resembling
explicitly distinctness and there's no example of this anywhere in nature this
is a clinical idea an idea of fiction of the laboratory a fable of the researcher
but it's the wrong fable it doesn't resemble life it resembles machines and machines don't resemble
life their relationship with time is entirely bizarrely flat compared to the
nature of organisms in their natural sort of metasymphony of relation over time
and this leads to leads me back to where I was before when I was beginning to say
that I think we're very confused about the nature of time in general certainly
that it resembles anything like our models is mostly wrong except in contexts where it's appropriate
and there are some contexts like that
the staggering vista the frontier for human knowledge and intelligence is not
spacetime or machines it's obviously it's consciousness and awareness it's the nature
of minds and their origins but it's also things that we have failed to be bold enough to imagine
about what's really going on around here inside our own bodies in our relationships
and in consciousness and most of what's going on for a lot of us
is heavily scripted it's scripted by our cultures our societies our languages the concepts they
include and the root concepts they exclude or never that never arose within them or that were
snuffed out by utilitarian concerns I've had many experiences that made obvious to me that our
explanations and ideas about what it means to be human or have a mind or if minds are separate
are wrong and I think they're mostly backwards if we lived in societies where these things were
deeply explored not superstitiously not as a religion but directly inquired into together
within for each other an astonishing universe of other intelligences other forms of intelligences
and modes of intelligences disembodied intelligences and so on would naturally appear directly to our
experience not merely to our ideas and thoughts think with me for a moment
about the unimaginable complexity of a single second and if we draw the boundary just at the
atmosphere of earth think with me of the complexity
of the signals and transformations that simply occur only in the viral population of this world
a population whose numbers are nearly incalculable though we could perhaps you know pause it
some exponential number that represents that population think of time at the scale of a virus
think of the trillions of viruses in a single body and then extend that to the entire planet the
network of viral intelligence on earth so vastly supersedes anything that we can imagine or encompass
that it absolutely dwarfs the entire history of human knowledge why would we believe knowledge
why would we believe our beliefs in the face of something so staggeringly beyond the wildest
science fiction which the natural world actually is always and never isn't how did we become so
confused by our capacity to name and model and analyze very small features of the vast
universe the infinite universes within universes that biology naturally comprises
composes enacts and embodies and this is if we take you know
I'm speaking as if merely the physical layer is the only thing that's going on but that also
cannot be true because again even if we take the physical layer what we know of its qualities
is unimaginably limited compared to the actual qualities that exist there in fact
in a single living organism there are infinite qualities in a biosphere of trillions of organisms
there are layered infinities of qualities
that can never be encompassed by thought belief or knowledge so why do we believe our thought
belief in knowledge I think one of the primary reasons is that it works in a utilitarian sense
we can accomplish goals many of those goals have to do with skipping time or changing
temporality the computer the oven the refrigerator these objects all specifically transform time
the refrigerator slows it down by slowing down the the number of molecular transformations
per second and the biological transformations per second in bacteria and so on this is why
we refrigerate our food essentially primarily to both preserve it over time and to keep it from
becoming highly bacteriologically active so cold inhibits biotime and warmth generally tends to
accelerate it this whole time skipping agenda makes certain features of our behavior and mechanical
ability appear very compelling and profound but compared to the simplest organism they are trivial
we believe them because our common human experience is woven through with
utilitarian goals the goals of commodification representations transmission and exchange of
commodity and representation but where do these commodities come from they come from living beings
there's no place else to get them from around here we might argue that well gold isn't the
result of living beings but the commodification of gold is the result of living beings without living
beings gold is perhaps no more or less intrinsically valuable at least not to humans than any other
substance it does however seem that the material complexity of the living world
is a crucial feature in producing the robust expressions of organism organismiosis relation
