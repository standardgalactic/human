development conservation over time and so on that we're familiar with or rather or are we
are we familiar with it to what degree are we familiar with it and which portions of it
acquire our attention awareness concern and purpose of behavior
part of what i'm trying to argue here is a is a strange argument proposed by a scientist friend
of mine dr kevin beru who said that the two different things right the first thing he said is
if we're going to just make shit up well then we can just make up anything and i don't feel like
that's useful or meaningful um and that's a very abrupt sort of comment but he goes on to say
metaphysics are largely uninteresting to me because the actual complexity of physical reality
makes them look silly in comparison and i think there's something to that argument
what's actually going on the nature of time space and organisms and symbiosis in time space
is so astonishing that humans have failed to conceive of anything resembling yet
and we are continually forging new kinds of mechanical electronic and conceptual representations
which is a pretty strange behavior for a biological creature
for the simple reason that that behavior begins to compete directly not merely against
the minds that engage in it but against the history and future of life on earth and yes
it's possible to damage the history of life what we as a species do in this moment changes
the meaning of the history of all of the living beings on earth and it certainly changes the
meaning of human history if we do something profoundly amazingly beautiful that transforms
the meaning of suffering that has been endured in previous time similarly if we do something so
catastrophically ignorant that it casts a pall on life on earth or um become something that we
should surely be deeply ashamed of having done then similarly we have changed both the history the
meaning of that history and the meaning of the future at least for ourselves but certainly for
other creatures as well around here it looks to me like there's one family and the family has
transcendental origins and by that i just simply mean origins far beyond our capacity to imagine
model or consider at present but not beyond our capacity to participate in and this is the key
thing i'm trying to get across we are missing out on most of the potentials of our nature as
organisms as beings as as consciousnesses awarenesses and as families of life traveling together
and doing something incredibly important together that certainly isn't the production of objects
for grocery stores or electronic objects to populate machines endlessly
you know if we if we love each other if we love life if we love nature if we love time space
if we love our children we must explore this frontier and free them of the incredible
incredibly cruel and arbitrary limitations that our common conceptions impose on us
yes there's the danger of madness there's the danger of religion there's the danger
but we face all these dangers anyway if if our systems of thought or are so primitive or crude
that they largely exclude us from our own innate nature and abilities then we must
agree that they have failed to be anything resembling intelligence
and if we agree that they have failed then we must establish new frontiers with which we can
recover direct experience and understanding of the features of nature organisms and humans
that don't fit in the models we've become accustomed to obey
i imagine the possibility of a radical and sudden transformation in the entire network of human minds
a transformation catalyzed by a small group of people who simply discover together
a few compelling features of our nature that have been blatantly ignored glossed over
weaponized in religion or for the sake of technology and so on
and this gives me hope it's a dire moment for life on earth right now it's an incredibly dire
moment for the humans we have you know it's funny as a species it's it's really as if we're possessed
by demons or something there's there's no there's nothing that resembles intelligence
at the species level of our species our societies and corporations our nations our staggering absurdities
that have nothing to do with what's going on on earth the nature of organisms the nature of
consciousness or awareness except perhaps as sort of the kinds of strange diseases that we might see
on display at some freak show if there are other intelligences in the universe if they visited earth
they must either understand intimately the catastrophes that led to the current situation
for humans or they must think there's something fundamentally wrong right they're using
they're using consciousness time awareness and potential to produce its opposite an importing
entropy death and decimation to the biosphere that otherwise is robustly negentropic
i realized the other night as i was thinking through some of these ideas that
machines import entropy
to into the biorelational anatomy of our planet in ways that are dangerous and some of which are
completely too invisible to us we don't imagine for example as human beings that the earth might
be doing something important something so important that again it generates organisms and minds as a
mere side effect of this heroic activity it's engaged in its role in the solar system in
interstellar space and in time space itself we don't imagine that there are different modes of
time but there certainly are each object that we see whether it is a rock or a tree or a bird
or a whale or a school of fish or a mountain each of these features that appear to us visually and
conceptually are hiding something so astonishing that the slightest hint of it would obliterate what
we think of as knowledge but instead of seeking for direct experience of and participation in
this grand quest that life on earth is certainly about our species is busy doing the opposite
right we're trying to tear all that stuff down and build a bunch of mechanical processes instead
in propagating hundreds of millions of objects and and so on we're directly interfering in whatever
it is the earth is doing and whatever the earth is doing it is doing in concert with the sun
with the sky with the origins of the universe and the nature of time space each of the forms here
each of the biologies is a unique mode of temporalities myriad relational temporalities
in effect a multi-dimensional temporal manifold each of the organisms we see each of the natural
objects we see have this quality but we do not examine this or consider it together
what has happened to so severely blind us one of the strangest answers to this question
can be drawn from a gloss on the Genesis story
once you can name things you can relate with the name and you can believe that you know the nature
of the thing because you have a way of calling it out and distinguishing it from all other things
and this particular capacity and the forms of memory that are associated with this capacity
are extremely dangerous if they develop unchecked they will lead to an animal not merely capable of
tearing down the biosphere but one that will become furiously compelled to do so in new ways and modes
per minute and that is the position it appears our species is in at the moment and that position
places us directly in conflict with whatever the mission of our world is and I would suggest that
it's not a single mission it's a symphony of missions bound together in a heroic
and very delicate context that is important in ways we've so far failed to imagine
but we can and I say that we will and I hope that you and I and others like us will continue
the quest and perhaps finally someday form a mission not to Mars but to the world of our origin
a mission that serves that world and its true natures and purposes in ways as beautiful and
intelligent as the nature of biology in time and space bring forth all around us moment to moment
thank you for joining me I look forward to learning again together soon
