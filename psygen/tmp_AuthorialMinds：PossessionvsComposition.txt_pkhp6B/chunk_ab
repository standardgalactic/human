and non-negotiable, right, seeming fears.
It's April 1st.
I think it's the duck moon still.
Sawakitsum in Nitsupawasan, Blackfoot language.
This is a time of year when of course Easter comes and the birds, many of the birds particularly
with waterfowl, are building nests and laying eggs.
And they're not laying eggs of fictions.
They're very attentive to everything that's actually happening right here now.
And we can learn something deep from watching the attention and care which they form nests
and relations and live in their world.
They don't have a lot of room for what they had and lost or what they might get later.
They're right here, right now, in the place that they are in the context they're in a living context.
We are too.
We're buried in a lot of overlays.
But we can reach out together from those overlays and back into nature, back into the living stream of time,
remembering ourselves and each other and the possibilities of our excellence.
Thank you for joining me.
Goodbye for now.
