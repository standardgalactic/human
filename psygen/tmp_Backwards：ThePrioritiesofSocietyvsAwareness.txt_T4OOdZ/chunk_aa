Most people would imagine that that would be a survivable mistake. However, I've had experiences with yellow jackets and they can be lethal.
I'm curious where the branch fell so I'm cautiously proceeding through the gardens. In case you've never seen one of these, this is a bird of paradise flower.
And this is the plant that produces them. You can see the unopened blossoms. They're gorgeous. Somewhere nearby is a tree that just dropped a huge branch and hopefully it didn't drop that branch on a human being.
I didn't hear anybody yelling so that's a good sign. I know which kind of tree is likely to have dropped that branch. Also, though I heard the branch crack as if it were going to fall, I did not hear it hit the ground.
And this is the most likely nearby culprit, a cypress tree.
Those trees often drop gigantic branches weighing up to a couple of tons, I imagine. I'm going to try and be a lot more careful when I'm doing something that I've often advised against, which is paying attention to my smartphone when I'm outside.
I entirely avoided smartphone ownership as a technician until about three years ago when a specific employer sent me the one that I'm making this video on and wanted to use it to communicate with me frequently.
And even after I received this phone, I resisted carrying it with me outside for a good two years. And also, when I did carry it, I didn't use it.
And I remember the first time I used it, the shocking disappearance, sudden shocking disappearance of my awareness of the world around me. All I did was look at the screen and it seemed as though the world disappeared in my mind.
My awareness of where I was, of place, of being, of relation, of danger completely disappeared when I looked into the screen just for a few moments.
I didn't find that terribly, well, actually I did find it terribly surprising. I had watched other people doing this for many years and had marveled at the seeming, well, what's the right word?
The power of the device to distract and disorient us, and particularly in nature, in time, and in relationships.
And those are most of what make our humanity recognizable and coherent. And so when machines disorient us there, we're really in very grave danger.
I don't yet, and I probably never will, understand why the Yellow Jackets didn't swarm me. I was standing directly on top of their nest, but they didn't.
And, you know, explanations can be very deceptive because phenomenon can be multiply determined, right?
In other words, we can find an explanation that suffices to appear, to expose the causal relationships underlying phenomenal events, expected and unexpected.
But even though they suffice to explain it, reality and events are so staggeringly mysterious in their basis that the beginning of the attempt to explain it all is already hugely problematic.
It involves presuppositions we have no reasonable justification for asserting. Nature doesn't function on reasons, and causes are...
...confusedly local in time and space, which I would suggest we do not yet understand very well at all, or are almost entirely confused about.
The nature of the relationship between consciousness and temporality between existence and space-time, between our personal experience and the phenomenon...
I always get the plural of that wrong. I need to study this phenomenon that conspire to emerge as our waking minds.
But there is another kind of mind that is not like our waking mind, and is much more like the strange reflection in this pool whereby looking down, I see up.
But I don't... My eyes don't touch the things that are up. They touch their reflections in a substance that in English we call water.
And as you can see, the water, its surface, is kind of alive with concentric events caused by things moving or touching its surface, primarily water striders.
But this reflectivity is hypnotic and beautiful. It is enchanting.
And this pool was designed for us to see, to be able to look down into the water and see up into the sky.
To see particularly the moon at night.
Since the gardens are not open at night, very few people have seen the reflection of the moon in this pool, but I am one of them.
Now I don't have a particular topic before me in mind today.
Though I want to share some of my recent reflections and experiences.
Particularly about the peculiar flatness of the waking mind and its capacity to distract itself with its own productions, projections, explanations.
A word that literally means to flatten out, to explain is to put on a flat surface.
And we might think, well, we might reasonably think that there is a loss of dimensionality there, because here we are in ordinary four dimensional space time,
presuming that we decide to call time a dimension.
This is a little waterfall where I've often seen hummingbirds bathing.
There are aquifers underneath the garden and the engineers and the people who built these gardens on top of sand dunes long ago.
The underground aquifers produce the water that supports the life here.
You will notice little areas where the water is flowing.
And if you observe a place where water is flowing very closely and follow the flow with your eyes again and again,
when you look away you may find that reality is warping and distorting.
And this is partly due to the visual neurons becoming, this is the right word for this, becoming,
in order to maintain your focus on the flowing water,
your visual organs and their neurological aspects,
they have to modulate and this modulation creates a sort of momentum
that when you look away from the flowing water, that modulating momentum continues for a little while
until the organs that you see with and their neuronal elements
adjust to the less fluid movements like those of leaves or branches in the breeze
or even the stillness, the relative stillness of non-liquid phenomena.
Water and fluid and flow are extremely important analogs and metaphors and similes
for the dreaming mind and this is no accident.
And although our cultures and societies are inclined at their broadest definition
to dismiss or belittle what happens to us at night when we dream,
it's long been my experience that we've got this probably almost explicitly backwards.
In fact, it looks to me like we began with dreaming as children
and this is what we call the imagination and play
and over time we built these structured aspects of awareness, concern,
attentional function and consciousness out of the foundations of dreaming
and we kept emphasizing and rewarding that and punishing the other thing
and of course who is we, the culture in general, adults, teachers, school, so on.
We kept being told over and over again that imagination was relatively equivalent to nonsense.
Interestingly, one has to imagine that in order to assert it, therefore something's fucking wrong with that idea.
Now I am approaching the dangerous part of the park where in this moon cycle
which will turn into a new moon cycle in two days,
this part of the park which is less visited
is likely to contain undiscovered and thus undestroyed wasp nests.
This is actually one of my favorite parts of the garden because there are fewer people here
and most of the people I do encounter here are likely to be more peculiar.
In any case, I had a series of relatively astonishing dreams
even though there have been difficult transformations in dreaming for many of us
during the unexpected changes and challenges we've all been facing.
This is a white sage plant. I just love the scent of this plant.
I'm going to take a risk and walk back here
paying very close attention to where I put my feet
and the flight paths of insects near the ground.
One of the ways we can think
and there's useful ways of thinking and exploring and analogizing our relationships with consciousness
and this has just occurred to me for the first time, it's kind of peculiar
and it's probably because I've been listening to the Eric Weinstein podcast The Portal with Roger Penrose
who is one of the true prodigies I've had the good fortune
to be born during the lifetime of.
How unfortunate that I have not mastered the mathematics required to understand many of his discoveries
and the book that he wrote called The Road to Reality
a book of some of the finest expositions of waking consciousness
is staggeringly beautiful and complex.
It sits on a pedestal in my room.
It's the only book that sits on an actual pedestal in my room.
This is the little pond where I sometimes practice the obscure art of frog sneaking
that is the ability to sneak up on a frog without it leaping off into the water.
However, I am not practicing that discipline today
and in fact the pond is largely empty because it is an artificial pond
and it has not been recently filled.
Nonetheless, there are frogs here.
I have heard them in recent days when I have traversed this little bridge
and when I get to the other side of it, if you hear some plopping sounds
we might be seeing some frogs or hearing them.
Yep, there was one.
There was a little bit of water left.
Frog sneaking requires incredibly slow movement.
You have to learn from the blue heron, the egret, the crane
how to move with otherwise unimaginable slowness
and the frogs helped me learn that by their incredible sensitivity to movement.
What I was thinking a little while ago was that in a way to dream is to change the sign of consciousness
and if we call waking consciousness positive then dreaming consciousness would be negative.
I am actually going to walk back and visit some plants
before I dare to approach the place I survived my yellow jacket encounter the other day.
Now, in consciousness the peculiar nature of positive and negative
if we choose this analogy which we certainly don't have to and it could be a bad one.
It could be not fruitful enough, not rich enough.
Perhaps dreaming awareness or dreaming experience is the possibility of consciousness acquiring a sign
and waking experience is the result of it having done so.
Glad I walked back here, look at that feather.
That's a sweet one.
That's a beautiful one.
Yeah, look at the color. Just gorgeous.
Got lucky.
I suspect it's a falcon feather.
Part of why I was returning here was to see this little...
Probably a Cooper's hawk might have dropped this feather.
I wanted to see some of the plants here like the hummingbird sage of which this is an old flower.
Here's some really larger ones.
And also this sage, this California sagebrush here.
There's some other hummingbird sage back there but I wanted to see my friend
and this relatively developed white sage plant here.
These are its flowers.
And many of the white sages I've been aware of have undergone sort of weird vivisection by humans for various reasons.
Those flowers there are fully flowering branches of white sage and these are pre-flowers.
These ones haven't flowered yet. I'm not even sure if you can hear me when I turn the camera away.
So once again I now have both hands full as I did last time when I almost got in trouble.
In any case, as I was saying, dreaming might be the possibility of signedness
and conscious waking could be when consciousness acquires a specific sort of value.
And it acquires that value by a process I would analogize as collapsing from potential
what we would usually refer to as ambiguity into derivation or disambiguation into structure.
And while we are awake we are mostly trapped in habits of structuring consciousness
according to methods we've long enacted and come to embody and become somewhat trapped in
because they are so compelling. They are very compelling, these methods.
And I'm approaching the scene of my last adventure.
And unfortunately I don't see the owl pellet with the skull in it
that I had some modest hope of retrieving.
But I do see the stump and I do see yellow jackets returning to the nest location.
Not in huge numbers.
Oh yeah, there's the location all right.
Wow, I just can't imagine how I got away with that one.
I can't imagine it. I have no explanation for that.
Yellow jackets are profoundly unfriendly to people standing on top of their nests.
They're not particularly friendly to humans in general.
In any case, the habits that we acquire and use particularly those habits that are valuable in our relations with culture and work and machines and such,
they are unfortunately crippling in many ways.
We are lucky enough to have or determined enough, it's not merely luck, it's also choice,
we're determined enough to make our livings in creative endeavors such as music or dance or art.
And there are highly structured creative endeavors too, architecture for example.
Here's a peculiar construct, rather dreamlike in its way.
It's supposed to be, it may supposed to be a stegosaurus, it may be supposed to be.
All right, I'm going to take a moment and stash this feather.
The habits that we are rewarded for acquiring, it's funny, I can see yellow jackets heading toward the nest even though they're relatively infrequent.
And I'd like to get up modestly close to that nest and look around and see if the owl pellet that contain the strange skull,
I mean most skulls are strange to me, is still there.
But I'm really nervous about it because I survived the first time and I don't know how.
The nest would be relatively safe to approach at night time, but not so much in the daytime.
And this is the location where it is.
And you can see a few yellow, oh I think I see the pellet, yep I do.
Oh that's interesting, the pellet is right next to the nest now.
I left it on the stump, yeah I'll not be retrieving that pellet.
At night time you might get away with it, particularly if you used an implement.
So as I was saying the habits that we acquire and enact in order to participate in culture and particularly to have jobs and perform relatively bizarre inhuman functions.
There's a lot of raptor activity around here.
It, like sort of the opposite of watching water flowing, which then when we look away leads us to see flow in all kinds of, in whatever we look at.
It's the opposite of that, it's the dead structured function of our waking world concerns, behaviors, habits, fears, necessities, work.
And where that work is beautiful or profound then of course it can be enriching.
Unfortunately for most of us or many of us large portions of our lives are going to be precisely the opposite of enriching.
They're going to represent relatively cruelly enforced drudgery that we have to do to keep the illusion of properly
properly necessary structure and the layers of illusions that our modern societies not only depend upon but consistently reinforce.
The policeman comes to think of herself or himself as a cop.
The liquor store worker thinks of himself or herself as an employee.
Just now as I'm making this video, I received an email in which the world of work is a vortex.
And in our time, for some of us, no part of our life is safe from it.
It wants to subsume everything.
And this is tragic and dangerous and this is part of what dreaming anneals or heals or refreshes or restores.
It's the difference between this thing, this big object of metal and structure, an absolute, notice how static it is.
Wind doesn't move it, rain does not move it, sunlight barely changes it.
Yeah?
The difference between that and this.
And I could talk about that difference for days and in joyful preference to this.
Because that other thing, it doesn't actually destroy our minds, it does something worse, it enslaves them.
So we should recognize that there are inclinations of the waking mind's conceivable nature, not necessarily it's true nature or it's only nature.
There are properties that are supercultures and organizations and masters and the elite and the wealthy and corporations and nations and schools and prisons.
They take advantage of these things to produce slaves and it's evil.
It's the closest thing to evil that is sort of ever presently common for many of us who live in these circumstances.
