village and conditional love environment that I was, you know.
Look, whenever you take a cohort like lawyers or doctors or dentists or teachers,
you're going to find a large prevalence of what I'll call the worst common denominator,
which is the people who, you know, but what you're actually looking at
is a topology.
And as you come to understand the structure of the topology,
you will be able to find the people in the cohort who aren't defecting.
And those people will be excited to discover you as well.
Oh, yes, yes.
Right.
This is a moment of mutual appreciation, right?
That's long been coming.
Many of us would like the dreams of our ancestors not to be flushed down the toilet
in a single generation.
And some of us would like those dreams to be actually fulfilled.
So that's those purposes live in the hearts of humans.
And if we can awaken them, it will be very powerful and it doesn't have to be a cult.
Yep.
Yep.
It doesn't even have to be political.
It can just be human.
Yep.
And you often, you know, in your writing, you, you, you know, you, you say this,
this is an everyday thing.
Yes.
This is, this is normal.
Yes.
I think that's what those guys in the book I quoted from earlier were saying too.
They're like, we have this narrative that it's impossible to change this and that humans
are fundamentally broken.
It's not true.
They're just trapped in, why are they trapped in thinking they're broken?
So yeah, these are things that I, that I want to keep exploring and understanding better
and get people doing something around, right?
Experimenting, play, grow, learn, discover, remember, remember how we can be.
Yeah.
I'm trying to, you know, in my own way.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Good.
Good.
So, you know, between Indonesia and San Francisco, you know, I'll, on this, you know, formulate
some more what, what steps we can take, right, making this happen.
Yes.
We let us, let us bookmark that for our next conversation, but there are some for sure.
And I'm, I'm absolutely willing to explore them together.
I just need to get some food in me.
Okay.
Good on you.
Okay.
Sorry.
No, no, it's fine.
No, this is wonderful.
I'm very, I'm very grateful and excited.
This has been profoundly educational for me.
That is beautiful.
Beautiful.
Yes.
Very new.
Okay.
Thank you.
Catch up with you.
All right.
Our blessings, my friend.
We will talk again soon.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay.
Bye for now.
