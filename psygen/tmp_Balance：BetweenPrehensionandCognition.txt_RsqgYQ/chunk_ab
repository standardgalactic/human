experiment. And if someone said would you like me to wet make all of that go away and I thought
they could, well I wouldn't, I wouldn't sign up, don't sign up for that.
But I'd be really curious. And if they showed me someone who had undergone this process and I
liked what I saw, I might try to figure out how to do it myself.
And maybe I've been trying for a long time actually. And so I at least know that there's this balancing
beam between the pre-conscious,
the mind, and what the mind does and how that comes out in language or statements or arguments
you know assertions or declarations so on.
I know and I can follow the path back from the crust right down into the inner layers a bit.
And my ability to do that depends on a lot of things but I have the ability to do that.
And I would suggest it's a fairly common ability nearly all of us who have you know volitional
a volitional relationship with mind right to some degree we can learn to do this.
It's not my goal to extol that here or try to convince you. Rather I'm actually just trying to
not fall over into the face noises land too much.
We seem us humans an unimaginable anomaly if the face of the living world is our comparator.
And this is we can explain this various ways that's not going to help me.
I think we're participating I think our minds are evidence
and and this is more true when we sort of descale them right when we can or if we can just suspend
the primacy of the crust. I think our minds are
the the the expression
of relationships among maybe either many minds or possibly all minds.
And so one can think of the brain however you want but the mind has the capacity to act as
some kind of transceiver. Yeah it can transmit and it can receive.
And our models and our ideas don't generally accord with this fact.
However just the fact that I can speak this language and it reaches you is and that you
can understand it right is proof that minds are transceivers or at least the analogy is not entirely
off right. So one way to think about the some of the understructure of the mind not all of it
but some of it right because I'm arguing against the idea that we simply possess minds here.
One way to think about the some of the understructure is that it's shared
right it's in the between of beings it's in the between of human beings in the between of human
beings and all of the different beings that live in the natural world it's in the between of
my organs and my brain it's in the between of the cells in my body and my body it's in the
between of the history of organisms that I am the living moment of expression of in a way not
unlike how the flower of an orchid is a living expression of this this plant.
And there are many who have argued that minds are kind of this flower thing and I think there's
something to it I really do in the sense that there are bees
and pollens are exchanged yeah
but what I want to talk about you know what I've been
thinking of and pondering is just
I've often said that the first brain in our body might be ourselves
the second brain might be our gut because that's way older than brains there were guts
on earth and they were the organ of knowing long before there was anything like brains
six sevenths of the history of life on earth no brains just guts
so our gut might be kind of the first brain our immune system is another
fascinating entity that's mind-like or you know in the body and maybe our brain is like the third
the third brain right so there's all these sort of layers of brain-like or even meta brain-ish
right even they can be more than we don't know what all those cells are doing right they could be
doing something much more sophisticated in their context than what it appears to us
what we are inclined to think about our brains doing in modern times
so there are these layers right there's these other layers there's embodied layers
and some of those layers are way older than brains way older time at the scale of a single cell
must be very different from time at the scale of an animal and if an hour is equivalent to a week
and you have 30 trillion bacterial cells or something like this
then an hour is 30 trillion hours and our cells go back to the dawn of life on earth
and they live in a hyper structure that doesn't really care whether it's on the grass or part
of your body right they can just they can they can ride in every form of life on earth
in and on and do and in fact without them we wouldn't be animals there's there's this polarity
in us right there's the animal cells and the bacterial cells and the viruses and you know the
fungi apparently so those cells can be understood to form something like
a biorelational hyper system
so they're the they can they can be thought of as like the trans light velocities of
organismal sensing and intelligence
I was listening earlier today to an interview with John Carpenter
and he was talking about something very familiar to me though I hadn't heard his particular take on it
and what he was saying and I'm going to have to be really careful here
because I'm going to use slightly different language than him
he was saying
that that psi meaning extra what we think of as extrasensory perception
which also has the capacity to see it has the capacity the capacity to see into time in different
ways but there are a lot of different aspects of what we think of as extrasensory perception
what he was saying is that this is the first sense that this is the prehensional
like the before thinking sense and we use it all the time and it's a natural part of everything
which is something I've been saying for a long time one of my quips which is a bit tired but
um there isn't anything but
psychic phenomenon going on we just don't recognize that all of this congeals out of that
yet uh so we have it backwards we think psychic phenomenon is a super exotic thing
that's probably a fairy tale and was made up in old store no that's not what's going on
and neither is it true that the kind of um light worker drag wearing psychic people are all actually
psychics neither of those things are true uh but but something astonishing is going on and
it's it's more astonishing than all of our metaphysical ideas so much more that it would
obliterate if it should shine but the slightest light of its actual activity on our awareness
so he was saying in his language psi is the first sense
and he was saying you know our bodies respond to things before our minds think about them this
is a well-known fact um our bodies our nervous systems uh our our spidey sense right the force um
we feel when you know and this becomes very apparent if one starts to slow down the
the games on the crust right if you start to settle get those to settle down you eventually
are going to encounter something that closely resembles what i'm talking about and you'll
become aware that you have forms of awareness that have nothing to do with your consciousness
and come way before it and what consciousness mostly does is package up convenient little
explanations and and put your little birthday card on there and present those to you as
you know as if they are definitive authoritative it explains things it describes things long
after the fact right long before i've spoken these words something in me understood that isn't my mind
and that isn't these words it understood
the landscape i was seeking the inner landscape and the ideological landscape
and the essential life pulse
from which my desires emerge
so john carpenter
who's a therapist and a researcher interesting cat like his work
he poses the idea that sigh is the first sense and then there are various layers of
the unconscious mind subconscious the nervous system the um the unconscious the subconscious
mind and then conscious activity is kind of the the crown on the head you know on the
the really crusty golden crown on the head of of these things and you know generally goes around
taking credit for all their work and and shutting them down and doing other kingly imperatives
i'm not trying to be mean but let's face it the the minds we're stuck with while we're awake for
many of us anyway can be really cruel taskmasters
and they you know that's bad enough but if we had the opportunity to just
sort of do that descaling movement right that analogy that i'm making to take the crust off
and see with unfettered consciousness um all of the layers of unimaginable intelligence that are
actually precessing within us in a way like the sun goes through the sun the moon and the stars
come out all of these intelligences us within us are doing this all day long but we're so involved
with our minds that we don't get a taste of it and then if we do get a taste of it and we're
not relatively disciplined we're likely to start telling stories in regular human language about
this is psychic that that's you know this is supernatural so on and so forth
i imagine a people who were born with shoes on
will just make up a story for fun these people are born with shoes on and no one ever takes
them off and actually they've never even seen an unshewed person
and i guess this is not entirely unlike most of us right most of us haven't seen inside bodies
but um for these people a foot would be supernatural if they saw a foot
they'd be like really freaked out and scared and it might terrify them they might start killing
each other they could start religions it would be a catastrophe in this story right in the little
you know fable that i'm making and this is what's kind of going on with us we were born
our minds are made for things we don't we do not know exist
and if we want to point in that direction for some reason for a long time everyone
thought it was really spooky so they called it the supernatural but it's actually just the natural
and the weirdness of the natural the the the staggering complexity of the accessible intelligence
and heroic imperatives of the natural would obliterate our entire set of categories never
mind like you know metaphysical or concrete that would just be obliterated and gone those
categories are so crude that if that's what you're trapped with it's like having your legs tied
together and then going out through your life like that right um and i know because i've i've
been i've i've been there and i'm not entirely free of it even though i'm aware of these matters
i'm still in the prison with y'all
but i can imagine a day when we break out
and the distortions we inherited again become wings wings that can make new dimensions in which
to fly every time they fly together and this is what the children are seeking and they're
to be honest i remember and have talked to very small children they're extremely puzzled
about what's wrong with the adults they get it right away that oops something went wonky with daddy
in his head sack right oops mommy's living in a linguistic fantasy that has nothing to do with
what's going on little children they get this all the time because their minds are still learned
they're trying to fly right they're trying to get those wings going and the culture and the parents
keep chopping them off um and leading the children to believe that that's exactly what's supposed to
happen and rewarding them for you know the little rituals where amputation occurs and this has been
going on since time immemorial for our species for reasons that are so bizarre and crazy that
i'm not even gonna approach them here presuming that the knowledge that i have is even useful
so
nature is fundamentally fundamentally transcendent and this is the word that i like
i'm not committed i'm not married but i like this word nature is transcendent it's much more than
sentience sent and sentience sentience is a downstream result of effulgently hyper intelligent
processes in nature so sentience is a lower order result of processes of higher order processes
that are constantly in relation with minds and bodies and organisms yeah and by higher order i mean
not requisitely specifically physically embodied
intelligences that can exist without being tied to a single body as we know them
they may be the field effects of myriads of minds but i think the myriads of minds
are the dandelion seeds of those intelligences
and i'm not asking you to believe this right i'm not trying to convert you or anything
i'm merely putting my own sense and experience
um
making a sketch of it yeah in case it is useful
but the way that we ordinarily think you know we think of our minds as being very
effective and good and powerful and knowledgeable and so on and so forth
in the in the contexts where we need the kinds of minds we've been given by our ancestors
in commercial culture these minds work okay
kind of like a three-wheeled you know like a car missing a wheel
in in in those contexts for most of us unless we develop them very carefully or we are gifted or
we're very lucky or we have great mentors and you know few of us i think relatively few of us
have that opportunity and most of us did bring some implicit gift some special unique
abilities and proclivities to our human incarnation but again a lot of that gets
digested right by the culture and sort of turned into various kinds of crusts that don't do
the flying thing anymore
and we have these really weird problems with language like we have this word imagination
by the way i'm going to go back to carpenter for a minute there's all kind there's there's a
reasonable quantity of research it seems to me that demonstrates that
our minds are reacting after the fact of phenomenon
like thoughts are the evidence of invisible work done elsewhere
and done at a very sophisticated in a very sophisticated way at a high rate of speed
but vastly slower than our nervous system you can't you can't think your way out of evading
a suddenly intrusive threat if you hand that off to thought you die our nervous systems our
bodies they evolved to respond you know relatively instantaneously to hints even and some people
will say well that's all that you're really talking about is people using hints really well
no it's not i'm talking about research where people can predict not with their minds with their bodies
you can watch people's metabolism and they can tell when a threat image is going to be
is you know they can tell before right a threat image is going to be presented in a random
series of images their body responds before it has been decided that the image will be shown
by a random number processor which is either seeing into the future or right so the body
whether they're they're not necessarily consciously aware of that and they don't have to be
these things are taken care of i don't know whether to call like the really intelligent
tiny stuff high level or low level but we'll call it lower level because we'll think of smaller
is lower here um but they're taken care of by processes that aren't entirely automatic
they're not merely you know the nervous system they are um relationally sensitive yeah they're
relationally sensitive essential so
carpenter's thesis is that psi is really common and we use it all the time in ways we're completely
unaware of consciously and some people are really good at using it you know more directive
directly for specific results and stuff uh and then some people just have
the question i'm not trying to answer the question of is there telepathy or not but there is
i'm just trying to say i think we've got the mountain upside down we've we've we've stood
the mountain on its point and thought the point was the you know the whole mountain
or maybe it's the iceberg problem i mean whatever you like right but we've gotten things backwards
we think that one of the clumsiest and slowest and most complicated aspects of what humans do
is the powerful intelligent good one when in fact it's more like this weird combination of
uh well i have to be careful here
the purposes for which it is well suited
