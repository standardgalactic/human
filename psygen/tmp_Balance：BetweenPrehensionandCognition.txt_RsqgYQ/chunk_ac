exist largely in a representational between context of human beings right you need it there
and you need it if you want to make complex devices and things you need it if you want to
have mathematics um so this overlay on consciousness that we call our mind
can form specialized crusts right like those of a musician or a poet or an author or
uh a doctor a surgeon a mechanic an engineer
a wanderer
they can form complex topologies
of highly developed expression
highly developed representational expression
for those of us who are lucky enough to have the luxury of becoming what we refer to as educated
and hopefully um a goodly portion of those get a diverse and well-rounded education
um you know an education rich in novelty and intelligence and creativity and insight
but that's relatively uncommon and you know
some few of us manage to preserve wing-like aspects of our minds
throughout the process of in-languaging and in-culturation
um and this is one of the reasons why artists are often sort of worshiped
is because they are the the emissaries from underneath the crust right they're
going to show you what's bubbling down there to some you know to some degree
yeah
musicians and you know performing artists and all these artists painters poets writers singers
actors
the really good ones
shake up the crust right they mess up they mess with that crust
and sort of cause you to go deeper into yourself and your own feelings and experience
um or they they catalyze that process they invite it
um
it's unfortunate that it's such a privilege
I mean I feel deeply humbled and honored that I have had the privilege to learn
some of these things and to try to see into the essence of
you know birth and life and death and light and time and living beings and
intelligence language knowledge
of course the crusts are kind of form of knowledge right they're kind of
they're little like those sheaves of fungi that you see
growing out from a stump of a dead tree
that's knowledge it's a way of visualizing knowledge although I
I'm not as um as anti-crust as I might sound it's just that I want us to know
together I want us to have our wings back
the many kinds of wings that are natural to our humanity
it's a lot of people out here today it's sunny it's hot
I'm gonna cross the street
um
I feel really privileged I feel privileged to have lived this long
I feel privileged for every glimpse I've had of anything resembling insight
I feel privileged for
the astonishing abundance of living beings
all around me within me and in you
you
you know if you don't think humans are social animals
you can see that in general they like to be together
and that's no accident
but there's a place where we're never not together
there's a dimension
of unity
from which some aspect of me is emerging moment to moment
into expression in this body in this life in my senses
and it's not conceptual and it has nothing to do with mechanics
and there's not a single model I've ever seen that would survive the briefest glimpse of this thing
it's funny you know the humans are fascinated by aliens but they don't realize that each one
of them comes from beyond not just in terms of you know
not just in terms of their origin moment though certainly in those terms
no no we we're coming from beyond right now right this is radio beyond
coming to you from deep beyond at this very moment
so I let my boat ride me a little bit
so that I could
frame some of these thoughts and senses that I have passions I hold dear
briefly briefly enough
I like John Carpenter's perspective he's roundly dismissed by academia
like his colleague Dean Raiden
who is aware of something very similar right that there's
there's something going on way before consciousness that's transcendental
to the models we're using to frame and think about and dissect and explain
what's going on as a human being
experiencing mind states while awake
mind states it's not really it's bad language
experiencing their peculiar transformations in the landscape of the mind
experiencing the process
of mind-like activity
these little flowers in the grass how like stars upon the darkened sky
how like thoughts emerging from the depths
wherein they find their origin
