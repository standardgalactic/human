I'm just going to bird walk a bit, which is a word that we use to indicate traversing a variety of possibly unrelated threads or a seemingly disorganized,
wholly  installment
One of these animals today that's probably a male and it's separated from most of the other animals.
They're pretty spread out at the moment which is kind of unusual.
But this one in the far west as the sun is beginning to set is clearly vigilant.
And perhaps is experiencing something analogous to trance.
Now when I use the word trance I'm speaking of something, I'm speaking of a general class of phenomenon in consciousness.
Or what humans refer to as states of consciousness yet this is not a particularly apt idea.
And is much like attempting to talk about states of water.
Which again isn't impossible or useless.
But what you have with water and with things that are flowing aren't exactly states.
States imply stasis.
And what you have I think with both consciousness and water are phenomena that resemble.
Gotta think carefully for a good word here.
Phenomenon that resemble modes of flow.
And when we think about waking consciousness there are myriads of modes of flow.
The same is true of dreaming consciousness.
We think dreaming always refers to the same thing this is a mistake when we think this way because it doesn't.
There are a vast array of kinds of dreaming if we want to examine the unique forms within the general class.
The same is true of trance. The same is true of waking consciousness.
The form of consciousness used when performing a math problem is not the same form of consciousness that appreciates for example the fabulous beauty of this organism.
And it's surrounding symbiotically related organisms and the sky and so on.
And that's a different kind of waking consciousness from the type that I'm using now to organize and produce vocalizations in English.
One might even argue that although when we are making language we're using a very similar kind of consciousness.
There are a vast array of different kinds of available consciousness within the language making kinds.
So that I have experienced forms of language making where as if I were possessed by something beautiful.
Poetics I could never write emerged spontaneously from me and were I to attempt to record those.
That would change the situation and it would be much more difficult if not impossible.
Even if I succeeded it would not be the same thing that would have happened had I not attempted to record them.
And I suspect as a poet that this kind of possessed impassioned mind that I've very occasionally experienced and wondered at may have been much more common to our ancestors who had no writing
and may be the origin of poetry and song.
When we are writing songs there's a vast array of different aspects or modes of the transformation of consciousness that we might experience.
Some of these can be very kind of technical, unthinky, but others of them are trans-like, emotional, beautiful.
And I think we revere musicians and songwriters because they not only are presenting evidence of having been in this form of awareness, this mode of awareness.
They're also creating an artifact or recording usually unless we're seeing something live that draws us into an experience of trans-like wonder or impassioned emotion.
And these are things we may too infrequently experience in life.
There's a hawk.
The hawk is hunting worms because the ground is very moist.
No, not because it turns out that the ground is very moist at the moment.
And that makes it easy for the hawk to hunt and eat the worms.
This is not a particularly common thing to see.
It often happens in the winter.
It's a very large hawk, probably a red tail, although its tail doesn't look particularly red.
It could be another kind, perhaps a cooper's hawk.
It's very large.
I'm just going to watch it for a few moments.
It's not that easy to show it because with the video I cannot turn the camera around while I'm making a video.
Maybe you got to see it fly.
I cannot see what I'm pointing the camera at when I'm turning my phone away from me.
One of the reasons we love music is that it transforms our consciousness.
Particularly when we resonate with it.
Although I'm from an older generation, a generation born in the 60s.
And through the 60s and 70s, what we referred to as popular music was vastly more sophisticated, emotionally, prosaically, melodically, lyrically than most of what qualifies as popular music today.
I suspect that my grandparents, my parents and grandparents would argue something similar about the music that was quote popular.
There's kind of a funny pun in that word.
We're not really a pun, some implications, phonetic implications.
In their time, they would have said, well, our music was much more sophisticated and rich in certain dimensions that they would have argued the music of the 60s and 70s was not.
It's very complicated what happens in modern cultures because over time our people became in groups and supergroups highly motivated to sell things.
This was not always the case, although the attention of human beings to acquire that attention was always valuable in some way.
But it wasn't always so expressly commodified.
It wasn't always so controlled, dominated by money, which is a representation of value.
And for some reason I find this particular image very apt.
The entrance is barred by steel.
One cannot come and go freely here.
One has to either belong here according to some groups' assertions or purchase their way in.
As human consciousness became a target for marketers, the depth and richness of our lives has been profoundly compromised and embedded in contexts that are really toxic.
Particularly the context, the contextual agents that marketers and advertisers comprise.
The primary purpose for which we are studied by corporations is to attract our attention to learn how to garner our attention and to transform that attention into the commodity of cash.
Now I would argue that in the 60s and 70s particularly there was a profound kind of renaissance of incredible creativity and poetics in popular music.
This isn't to say that the poetics was missing before that, rather it had different forms and pivots around which it orbited.
The commodification of music and art seems to me a tragic result of our consistently accelerating march into modernity.
There are, however, secret hidden makers and beauties that never get sold. Art that is rarely seen, private things, personal things, songs that are never recorded.
Many of the most beautiful things that have ever emerged from my mouth in terms of poetry there is no record of.
And in many cases there was no ostensible audience other than being itself or the universe or something like this.
Perhaps some of the most beautiful and intelligent things that have ever been done by human beings left no trace for the marketers to appropriate.
And this to me seems appropriate because the most beautiful aspects of our humanity and our intelligence are like small children sometimes will be very shy.
They know there's a world that will turn them into commodities and objects and artifacts, abstractions.
They know there's a world that is hungry to consume the essence and to kill, in a way, the beauty and the intelligence of our humanity.
And this to me seems largely the result of the commodification systems that have unfortunately dominated our culture.
They are purveyors of representations of value.
And on the one hand we might argue there's nothing but representations. This is a not-unuseful argument to explore.
On the other we might argue or assert that all these representations are the dead sort of shells of something essentially not merely alive but more than alive.
The origin of being, the pulse of the origin of being and all these things we make in our supercultures.
And even in our work and jobs and the things we consume and purchase, our cars, our clothing, our homes, if we have them, if we are quote lucky enough to have such things.
And certainly those of us who live in the west are much more likely to be quote lucky in this way.
That we will have a box within which we may be maybe capable of feeling relatively safe for the moment.
And a car with which we may be able to travel to other places.
And clothing and computers and smartphones and all of the accoutrements of modernity.
We have taken on the shells of our cultures, not entirely unlike hermit crabs except that the shells they acquire generally once we're living
And the shells we acquire are almost, of course our houses were once mostly living trees, that's important.
But most of the things we make are comprised of elements that are, I don't know how to put it, not particularly, not merely the remains of living things.
But living things had to die to produce and extract and create and shape and transport and sell them.
So this is fairly grim.
But to return to circle back to where I began, there are many different kinds of conscious phenomenon.
And when we speak of being awake or dreaming or being in trance, we're not talking about one thing.
Although we may believe we are because language is deceptive in this way.
It allows us to encompass a range of phenomenon, give it a name and then believe that we have a grasp upon it.
This is deceptive.
We should resist that sense, we should resist that feeling.
We should become aware of it and resist it because the profound diversity of our experience is excused and hidden away by habits in language
that very few of us will ever have the opportunity to become aware of
and therefore very few of us will ever have the opportunity to evade or escape.
I would like for all of us to have this opportunity.
I want more of us to have the ability to understand some of the dangers and traps implicit in what I refer to as formally representational cognition.
Which is the kind we are given as children.
When someone might say we inherit it, another might say we are infected with it,
someone else might say it is foisted upon us or forced upon us.
Some might use more violent language.
We believe it to be a gift to teach children
Most of us will do two things with our children and we are relatively forced to do these things in our cultures.
The first is to inculturate them, to introduce them to the various branches of cultural identity and meaning and activity that are prevalent
in the time they are born.
It wasn't very long ago that you would never see an infant or a small child with a computer in their hand,
looking into their hand unless they were marveling at the astonishing beauty and sophistication
of this very profound appendage.
Of course, it's not very long ago at all that no adults were interacting with computational technology.
This is a really new thing and it's become astonishingly pervasive.
And I would argue it's a trans induction phenomenon.
The reason that I would argue this is, well there are many reasons,
but I resisted having this technology for a long time.
As someone who watched the transformations that the introduction of computers and emails
and then cell phones and then smart phones produced in human beings and human relationships,
as someone who studied this phenomenon very closely and carefully,
I was extremely suspicious of this technology and I remained in us.
But I would argue that it's a trans inducing technology and one of the reasons I would suggest this,
although this is not merely what it is, it is not merely that,
is I remember the first time I brought my iPhone out into the world with me
and I paused to look at something on the internet on my phone.
And as I did that because I am unaccustomed to it, I was shocked.
I, the world disappeared.
My memory of myself disappeared.
My consciousness changed so dramatically in an instant from a single seemingly modest behavior
that I was absolutely staggered.
And I realized that the things I had been observing in other people,
the things I'd been concerned about in what I'd seen in other people's behavior with these objects
was not only,
let's just say my concerns could not have encompassed the intensity
of the transformation in consciousness I experienced
when I took out my smartphone
and looked up something on a news site
and I was completely blown away at the intensity of that immediate transformation
and it validated what I was concerned about that this technology is profoundly dangerous.
And yet, though it is dangerous,
it allows me to create something,
a record, an artifact
in which we can explore these dangers
and think about them together.
And perhaps learn to deal more intelligently
with aspects of our modern situation
that are lethally dangerous.
I believe it was in Greek
that it was proposed metaphysically
in a parabolic analogy
that at death or at least before birth
we are dipped in the waters of the river Lethe, L-E-T-H-E.
And this is the river of forgetting.
It washes away the memory of previous lives and experiences.
And much of our modern environment,
socially, technologically, relationally, vocationally
is lethal in the sense that it causes forgetting.
And the arts of memory that once existed and flourished
prior to the existence of writing
while not entirely lost
have been transformed, transformed, yeah?
And now we are in danger, I think real danger,
of suffering a sort of second catastrophic
evisceration of the organs of human memory
as we become more dependent on the internet
to know and re...
I can't even believe I said that.
First of all, the internet doesn't know anything.
To store.
To store encodings
that we are willing to think of as equivalent with knowledge,
which they can never be.
Machines have not the capacity to know.
Only living beings and places can know.
I reserve this word knowledge for living beings and places
and times and situations and relationships.
I similarly reserve the word intelligence for something very similar.
Intelligence is not a quality I am willing to associate with objects.
Object forks and stuff don't have intelligence.
Photographs don't have intelligence.
Photographs are not memory.
Wikipedia is not knowledge.
Knowledge is something that happens in human minds.
And there's an interesting feature of this word.
To know the ledge, know ledge, knowledge, right?
To know the edge.
To get as close as you can
to direct experience and understanding using memory.
We call the place
