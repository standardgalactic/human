abstract the derivatives properly as a kid but I could have said
they're big to me and I'm little to them maybe on a good day
and that perspective whether or not it is a fact is not the question
what you what what I needed was perspectives that would lead me to terrain where it was possible
to understand things that are otherwise you can't see them you'll never come across them they're
hidden things and they are hidden by the artifices we traditionally transmit and propagate and mutate
they're hidden by
to point fairly directly at where the actual serious problems are they're in our
understanding of what it means to be a fundamental thing like the sun the earth a living uh uh let's
say water the moon the rabbit the earthworm our class
the structure of the classes we use to describe organisms to ourselves commonly and to each other
is not only missing whole classes the ones that are left are badly artifacted they are
mostly empty structure right and that's a story that I can't chase at the moment I've chased it
before I'll chase it again another time so if we have a perspective from which we can be in the
relationship oh I am the small one right my people are the new people around here all these other
people without exception there aren't any others newer um well not at the macro scale it's all
kinds of new stuff at the micro scale uh and there's I mean novelty is still in the game
my point is just we're really new
and we as much as we have narratives about our origins and such we actually don't know them
though some people treat the question as resolved I certainly don't know I mean the kind of knowledge
we have in our modern lives is probably so new that it could be reasonably said to have arisen
in the past 150 years or something in any case a useful perspective
can be much better than facts because you want your imagination in the game
or not the game but you want your imagination in accessible to your senses right so that your
imagination you can use your imagination with your senses to extend your senses and your imagination
and if I tell you you know that the bird is of a species corvus corvidae belonging to this phylum
and you know nothing about the bird nothing about yourself nothing about the relations between you
that reminds me
I know a couple of birds around here
I wonder if they're still awake
I saw the living creatures as greater than me
in many ways that I couldn't speak of I still do and yet
that's not the most important thing to understand but it's useful and it's useful even if it turned
out somehow and I think this is kind of impossible but let's entertain the idea
if it turned out that somehow it could be proven that this is not the case
that would not render the perspective
fraudulent it would not render the perspectives
usefulness would not nullify that usefulness right because we need to be able to imagine
things
for rationality to work at all it has to be encompassed by imagination
so
there are cases in which we will transfer precedence to rationality
usefully but we don't it would be catastrophic if we were to either lock that position in place
or pretend that it's the rationality that's leading us and not our body our emotions our nervous
system
so even if the tiny beings aren't gigantic in five dimensions we don't have language about
I say to you they are as myself right you don't have to go along with me or believe me or adopt
my position but the position is useful whether even if it's wrong because it will give us access to
ways of being in relation
faculties of relation this is something they should teach us about as children
that without imagining something like that we have no opportunity to explore and in fact
we'll tacitly believe to be nonsense right this is the whole
this is the part of the the wrapper of the package of identity we inherit
right insects don't have essential being that you can connect with and participate with
really
I mean even pragmatically that assertion it's pretty easily decapitated
I mean pollination by itself
all of the contributions of we would not be having the conversation if
x you know x number of enormous populations of organisms were not producing oxygen
and we don't see them producing oxygen though we agree you know science scientifically
we've learned that organisms transform chemistry in various ways and produce oxygen
or at least that's our current narrative perhaps later we'll learn something even more astonishing
it's funny here is the last traces of a phenomenon from the previous moon cycle
this coyote scat the coyotes were eating berries
and leaving very well-formed scat
overnight I think there were a good 18 sites and it was a very unusual
sudden transformation of behavior in those animals
and I pay attention to those kinds of things
I don't always have a narrative about them I just
and in fact I often try to resist forming one though in some cases I need to
because sometimes you need a model to get to get to the next
you know location in a mystery
but yeah there's there's living language here all around us
and we have as human beings I think
an astonishing gift a library of gifts that are I mean they were born and were and emerged
in the pool of other beings on earth over time together one ship you know
know reasonably a single extremely complex organism
and we have very unique abilities we can bridge
we can create intelligent bridges between domains that must otherwise be kept
apart
and this is but one of the least of our peculiar endowments as human beings
nearly none of which we muchly access because what we inherit shuts most of that stuff down
what I did learn
and I'm not afraid to talk about being a boy or being a girl
from my own direct experience and I never will be
time is relative to meaning and when we pretend it's not
we're collapsing part of our intelligence that we need to notice that that's going on
in other words we're collapsing the thing that would notice that our site
we're throwing away some of our obscene ability don't want to attack that thing
and there's lots of weird ways to do it and one of the weird ways to do it hides
in a noble sentiment or in a noble purpose and yet is somehow not noble and often is something
undesirable wearing the costume of a noble movement or purpose
and very important to be able to recognize the difference
the coyotes among other things I think there was a
a non-ordinary aspect to their behavior in the last moon
and I paid very close attention to it
but the cherry or berry like food they were eating I think I found the food they were eating
and particularly the hulls of the shells of the seeds
they made a
as the coyotes digested the food
it formed in their intestines
a circular brush
that would cleanse the intestine as it's passed along it
and I suspect there were there was chemistry with the plant involved as well but there was an
obvious physical fact of suddenly the coyotes digestive tract is doing much better than it
ordinarily does right because this food is available and clearly they know this right
because there's scat suddenly all over the garden
again overnight whereas prior to that there was I could find two or three sites but I'd
have to look carefully and the scat was very unhealthy looking discolored full of hair
like that's common but just it just didn't look
it looked like their digestive systems were struggling
and the berries were the opposite of this
so they think they get some kind of a cleanse going on
there's much more significance to to the situation than merely that
but I'm curious about all of the animals and I've never really had a chance to be around
animals like coyotes before and it's a little bit smoky but I love them
one thing I did discover
is that although not many males were either born gentle or
survived the attempts to script them out of it
but a goodly number of females were mostly gentle there might be exceptions
they might have some specific animal or insect that particularly creeps them out
to which they just feel like you know confused about why this why they're in a world with things
like that some of the old fears in humans run deep
the women have perhaps or at least when I was younger it was traditional for them to
you know be a sort of traditional things for women to be afraid of
and if there was something traditional for men to be afraid of it was being like a woman
in other words
being gentle
being heartful
having compassion
saying no to cruel behavior
now I mean I grew up and became a regular human mostly or at least I got the shell of one
I'm still the the sensitive
gentle person inside and it doesn't mean I have no other right it doesn't mean
oh the range of Darren's humanity is limited to gentle no that's not
but the roots if you go way down to the you know the essence of my being
yeah that's what I know to be down there
or that's the you know a player expression whatever mysterious beauty is going on in the
essence of our being but yeah the girls were gentle and and they would
tell adults or boys or whoever not to be cruel to live things
and I think part of that cruelty was a response to fear and sensing in some way
that um you know the thing you can crush or shoot
so
it's deeply significant in a place that you can't see
but if there was some intuition of this the supremacy of the of the
you know as a concept the idea of supremacy
again it's like most concepts it's
appropriate and reasonable in if it's scope right if the domain in which we apply it
is appropriately
limited and coherent right like has integrity
but you can't apply something like that universally
the realities everything that's going on whatever it is quite nuanced
like sloganeering isn't going to help you much at all with the real stuff
in fact language should mostly be done away with if you want a taste of what's actually going on
I don't mean permanently but you got to be able to shut the sort of conceptual thinking
rational mind off and let the assets underneath it like let that stop dominating the game so
that the assets underneath it can tentatively you know emerge into embodiment in action
awareness right suddenly I become aware I can sense
a way of sensing about this tree I have never sensed before
and there's no language about it
it's not surprising there's no language about it language pretty crappy stuff for describing
intimacies intimacies don't fit in language not even in poetry you know music can evoke
various kinds of art and music and play can evoke
storms of beauty in our you know essence
but yeah it was easier to find
companionable minds with females because more of them were gentle
and it gets really old even if you've like I had status with guys because I was
playful good-humored mischievous pretty smart right I could read really well I had certain gifts
so I mostly had respect from the guys I was very lucky because the gentle boys who didn't
gain that respect suffered a lot not as much here as they did where my dad came up
but I realized that it was in my childhood then there where I lived in that time
70s late 60s and 70s
girls you didn't have to explain about being gentle to living things to girls
most of them innately understood it and there were exceptions but
but it was traditional or I think that's not the right word
yeah I'm I'm cautious about how to describe it but it was natural to the girls
to be gentle to living things
whereas it's unclear
it seemed I guess the boys have to learn to kill don't they
see this is where there's problems and you can say well why is it the boys
have to learn to kill don't the girls kill too and I can say yes of course they do
but back then at least and in many cultures it's long been traditional which would mean
that you can think whatever you like about the genders and their proclivities it would be embedded
in there'd be genetic embedding of some kind I suspect right of you know
gentleness and fierceness and maybe it's common in many cultures to laugh at or make fun of or attack
males who aren't
appropriately dismissive
of the actual majesty
of living creatures and plants and the sky
ha appropriately dismissive
so when I began the video I actually had no idea what I didn't have a topic
I just sort of had playfully the intention to follow a rabbit
right and I like to play in this way
it's nice to prepare and if there's something formal going on I'll try to prepare I might even prepare
very carefully but mostly when I'm just out walking in the evening
as I am tonight the camera is totally totally gonna fail to capture this but
but the hue of the clouds
gets this pink magenta pinkish
it's very pretty so I didn't really know where I was gonna go
so
