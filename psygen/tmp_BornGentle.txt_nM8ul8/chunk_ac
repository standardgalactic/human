now
I think I had good intuitions as a child about the living things
or maybe even instincts even though I really dislike this word
but now as an adult I can understand things
about
the nature of life organisms the earth
that are inconceivably profound and I
I hesitate to say anything about them
because their depth
and their nearness they're like right next to our fingertips and most of us will live and die and
never even taste the nearby presence of this but what's going on here on earth and I'm not claiming
to know what's going on I'm claiming to have had glimpses that were meaningful and matter
which I think is natural to everyone it's a matter of then of degree
but the living beings are as organs
and again something the humans don't have useful language about and have no category for
and we belong with them and they belong with us and in unison we have capacities
that would silence the myths with all
and perhaps
simplicity
I'd like to share something with you about the garden
before I sign off for the evening since it's beginning to get dark though the camera
keeps things looking bright for a bit
so we have here
what I like to call a peculiar situation and there's some mystery involved
but I assisted in the re-engineering of
this little mess here
and it makes the most beautiful tinkling sound it really makes like this musical tinkling sound
and
this
sort of becomes a river
and the river becomes a canyon
just like the river cutting through mountains
and here you can see
this is great the river goes under back under the earth
and it comes out here
and then
have to go around here
then the river comes to a cliff
and there's a waterfall though you probably can't see it very well
and it's very gentle and then
it spreads out and becomes kind of like a marshy sandy
sedimentary place and you can see that the water
in all the different parts of the river the water is different so the tiny river thing
is really quite an amazing phenomenon here
course actual rivers are
a different thing but having this little toy is fascinating
now I can't tell for sure whether the river dug the canyon
or whether humans participated
I think the I think a human dug a lot of the canyon actually
but it's a wonderful little toy and I love the music the water makes
on the metal
it's a beautiful
enchanting sound
well the sun is setting
day comes to close well the night comes to an open there's another way of saying it
I wonder if the coyote will
wonder if I will see the coyote that lives near here tonight
or the bats or the the white owls
they are big
in hidden ways living beings
you know there are some creatures that are uniquely adapted
to bond and interact with human beings as should be obvious we've domesticated some of those
well this is a mutual choice I don't know what happened I don't really know the story
but there are some in our common experience that are often interested in
in having an exchange with human beings
most common birds
songbirds and such they have some interest but corvids are particularly interested
mice and rats praying mantises jumping spiders octopuses
um ambush predators
this class of organisms they're they're like they're they have minds
that are capable of and interested in interacting with human scale intelligences more or less
directly and so we can learn a lot from them and I did they were they've always been among my
teachers though I've spent very little time with octopuses
snakes are sometimes interested lizards not so much but again uh it's not just
none of this is written in stone right the way that we are in relation with
with ourselves with the sky with with everything with the living beings this changes what's
possible right so having a range that you can explore is very important being told how things
are that's a catastrophe that's circumcision of the mind and the imagination and the relational
organs inside us the relational organs we are made to become wow look at that light
setting of the sun is almost always very poignant
for me if I'm you know if I'm there for it I'm if I'm in it which really means if I'm not in a box
thank you for joining me today my walk getting a little exercise
in my mind and my body hopefully my singing gave you something you can make good use of
or helped you to remember something you'd always known
but had been hidden this is how it is with the really good stuff often when we encounter it
there's this feeling of like oh yeah I recognize that even though
the mystery of history
bye for now thanks for joining me
you
