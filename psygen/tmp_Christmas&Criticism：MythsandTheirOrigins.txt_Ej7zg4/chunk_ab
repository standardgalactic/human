So perhaps I will go to it for a little while and see if it will protect me long enough to complete my video.
So I guess my goal today is to kind of sing the praises of the origins of our holidays and to encourage people to be cautious about being too critical of these things,
even though, admittedly, their modern incarnations are often impoverished of the depth that the wrapping paper and decorations
occlude. Oh, yeah, it's still raining. Okay, the tree is shielding me, though, pretty well.
I remember what I learned in my recollections, even though now those experiences are somewhat distant from my life.
And I remember them with reverence and awe and wonder and joy, and I'm grateful to have been able to have them while still a human being, a mortal being, in a strange and modern world,
that's often very superficial and confusing, and often very lonely.
I wish all of you deep joy, insight, awareness, creativity, play, joyful success in all the aspects of your life.
I wish you liberation. I wish you love and gentle kindness and wonder and awe and fulfillment of the promise of your incarnation.
Thank you for joining me.
Bye-bye for now.
you
