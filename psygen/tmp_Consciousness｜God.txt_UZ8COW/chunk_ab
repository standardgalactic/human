Is one of those experiences. Some of the barrier is removed. Now, of course, fundamentally it's
my understanding and experience that all beings and places are one being.
It's just that this is hidden from us. And beings who have lived before us are still
beings and beings who will live after us are already beings.
The way the universe is, or the great everything is, is so astonishing and unlike what we would
imagine with our common waking consciousness, that when confronted with it, there's a risk of death
from beauty. In Christianity, the phrase, the fear of God is commonly offered or spoken or written.
And in general, I think many people are inclined to interpret this phrase to mean that God is
terrible and wrathful and judgmental and so on. Whatever God may be, I think the reality is quite
the opposite of that. It's a great and terrifying ecstatic beauty. A beauty so astonishing that we
our individuality and probably our bodies can survive nothing more than the very least of
exposures to it. It's a beauty so vast and astonishing that were we exposed to more than just
the tiniest glimpse, we would expire of ecstasy.
Now, I'm not trying to convince anyone of anything here. I don't want to convince
people that my experience is real or Evans is real or what the scientists say is real.
And these are different kinds of reality, pedagogical reality, scientific reality,
clinical reality. This is a very different thing from what we might call the transcendental fact
of original nature or originary participation in existence.
Questions about God are very difficult to shed light on in ordinary language and thought.
We need forms of language, neologisms, specific ways of speaking, analogies, parables, metaphors
and so on that can point toward the nature of the divine without collapsing it into deliverable
terms and functions and so on. Thus we have the term transcendental.
All of that which is meta to all of that we are familiar with beyond that with which we are
ordinarily familiar, but perhaps directly involved in our capacity to have awareness or understanding
at all. So when I use the word God, I mean
a being in this conversation, I mean a being
who a transcendental being, a non-ordinary being outside of time, outside of matter,
who is the source of all beings
and in whom all beings both originate and exist probably eternally,
but when you're outside of time the meaning of eternity is not the same as the meaning of forever.
So I think of this as the being who dwells in unity,
the living communion of all beings and all that is beyond all beings.
I try not to ascribe qualities, nonetheless I have some direct experience of this,
that of which I speak or the one who of which I speak and I have narratives and models and
fairy tales and so on. It's not my intention to present those here. Those are the results both of
long passionate seeking and also of eventual partial success in this seeking
and so an experienced introduction to the world of origin or the place of origin or the origin
being. Now what other people mean by God depends on who's speaking and why and where and how and so
forth. Though the term generally points in the same direction, the distinctions are profuse
and some of them are absurd and impossible or at least they seem impossible. Now it's certainly
reasonable to suppose or imagine that there are something like sub-gods, godlets or angels or
organs of the being who dwells in unity that have specific purviews over aspects of the everything
and beings. And I think in this way and this also matches my experience
but I'm very cautious to reify any of these thoughts and say no this is how it is.
These are essays, they are attempts at pointing towards something completely transcendental to
language and concept much like a kiss. A passionate involved kiss is a departure from just about
everything else and there is no way to encompass it in language that we might try to compare it to
things or make descriptions of it or so on. Much like a dream those descriptions are not dreaming
if we could if we could actually describe dreaming we would begin dreaming and if we could
properly invoke a dream then we would re-dream the dream we were invoking.
This would be an experience of dreaming not an experience of description or storytelling
or narratives and thus it is when we emerge from a dream with memories and we translate those
memories into narratives this is not the dream this is not dreaming it's not even really a record
of the dream it's a record of waking mind sort of mostly left hemispheric-ish mind translating
things of which it has no real experience and very little relation with into the stuff it's used to
which is graspable concepts narratives plots and so on this is what ebbon did
with his experience and it's similar to what i myself have done with my experience
or experiences although in my case i always give the proviso
you know that what i'm saying is not the experience and these are toys of reference
that i've composed to attempt to talk meaningfully about something that really does not fit in
language very well at all although parts of it fit into parables and analogies and metaphors and so
on
whatever god is or may be
it appears there's something beyond even that
something so
transcendental that all qualities
hello
disappear and this is what is often referred to in buddhist and vedantic traditions with the word
emptiness of this i intend to say very little for putting hats on hatlessness is not my goal
however i will say that it in my view at present it more resembles
absolute
undifferentiated potential the before of all beingness than it does emptiness
very difficult for us to understand emptiness
and if i say this emptiness is dynamic which is my experience i've already begun making mistakes
that will lead to catastrophe so it's best for me to not speak too much about this except to say
that it is certainly not merely nothing and that there is a quality no that's not the right word
perhaps no every time i try to make a word i'm going to fail but i'll keep goofing around
here for a minute it's as if there's a dynamism in this emptiness and it's as if though exceeding
all qualities the emptiness has a certain kind of character to it or a potential character
or a potency there we go a potency that's what i'm looking for or perhaps infinite potencies
it's my experience that all beings and forms our reflections of potencies
in the being that dwells in unity and so the face of the raccoon the shape of the tree
the shape of my hand the wondrous transcendental beauty of the eyes of animals and humans
all that is attractive and all that is repulsive all of these things are
not precisely reflections
they are
what shall i call it it's difficult
they are resemblances
and appearances of
the nature of the marriage of the being who dwells in unity with the living waters
with time space and matter
and all of the things the humans make actually have qualities that are derived from features
of what i think of in my private world as the universe of origin wheels and rods and keys
and locks and disks and spheres and all of the geometric forms
i'm in a place of a lot of wind so we might say i'm very inspired right now
so i want to shift now toward talking about
consciousness awareness and i guess i'll start by talking a little bit about what i mean by the
use of these words
and here is some tricky ground to traverse
consciousness is that by which
anything is revealed
the analogy is light
in the sense of seeing
with zero light there is no seeing with zero consciousness nothing is revealed
and there is nothing to reveal it to
consciousness and awareness are primordial they come before all ideas and concepts without
them there are no ideas or concepts there are no minds and all of the entire lexicon
of things that humans have made words to point to dissolves
now this is a peculiar thing because
if i say if i refer to the sun i'm a human being referring to the sun
if all the humans were to disappear suddenly or if they were to be somehow rendered never
having existed then there is no such thing as the sun because the humans have human concepts
and words to point at stuff so when i say the sun i'm using the human ideas and concepts and words
to point to the phenomenon that we can experience directly as humans
but if there are no humans there's nothing like the human idea of the sun
there might be something there but there's no one to comment on it therefore there is nothing to be
said of course we could imagine that if just the humans disappeared then all the other
organisms would still have experience of the sun but that would not be the human idea or
experience of the sun so again we're left with the same problem there's something going on but
we cannot say anything about it because all human ideas and concepts have disappeared with humans
and this is very important it's not just a merely didactic point
when we use human language and a specific human language like English
then what we're doing is participating in a tradition of knowledge and reference
whatever is actually going on is far beyond that tradition and cannot be encompassed by
any of the traditions or even by their sun what is actually going on is transcendental to knowledge
and language description analysis evaluation and this is where science runs into a variety of
problems i was laughing earlier listening to tim ferris talking to swamiji and
i think he was repeating something ken wilber said about reductionists
and reductionist materialist paradigms like those common in science
and he said let's see if i can remember
apparently for the reductionists everything can be explained by the idea of frisky dirt
now of course this also fails because if they had just said
everything is simply dirt then they'd be close to success the problem here is they have to explain
why the dirt is frisky why is there friskiness associated with dirt what is that frisky thing
and of course what they mean is something like
something like
unpredictably erotically self-facinated particles but where where you get the eros see this is the
problem there's a number of movements within neuroscience and other sciences whose goal it is
to dismiss everything that cannot be clinically grasped and evict it from the subjective world
of experience by calling it an epiphenomenon so you don't have consciousness consciousness is
just an illusion it's like the exhaust produced by the functioning of your brain or something like
this which is ridiculous because there are no brains in boxes all brains are full bodies
your nervous system is all throughout your body it relates with every aspect of your body your
body so the idea that it's all in your head is some kind of catastrophic confusion
philosophically this goal belongs to a school called eliminative materialism and
and what is being eliminated is anything outside the mechanics that we can get a grasp on everything
transcendental is to be eliminated it's kind of a weird idea in fact it's a catastrophically dumb
idea though it's useful right we need people to make these kinds of arguments in order for us
to understand why they fail and the basic feature of their failing is relatively easy to get a hold
of without consciousness you don't have the concern of eliminating anything it's consciousness that
gives you the questions that lead to the desires for this elimination and the functional arguments
for it however crude or impossible they may be so to try to throw consciousness away and say no no
since we can't explain that obviously it is that with which we have the desire for explanation
without consciousness without awareness none of these questions or concerns could arise
um so it's ironic in fact it's recursively ironic that consciousness would result in a school of
thought that attempts to eliminate it as a subject of concern or wonder or fascination or curiosity
uh
Dawkins and Dennett and Hitchens
Harris those are the four horsemen these are eliminative materialists and it's sort of
ironic that they would attack theists though again it makes some sense because of their concerns
hello sweetness yes hello
the cat has come to visit me and it just came running like we were old friends
hi my beauty yeah hi sweetness
had no fear
it just it was it just ran right up to me
I wanted to say hello what a beautiful soul you are yes yes I love you yes I do I love you
how did it know how did this cat know
that we could be companions that we could be friends
it doesn't seem to be a young cat
and I'm going to guess it's a female
I like to think that it's very sensitive like me
I don't think the cat is a machine the cat is a soul an embodied soul
and it senses just as I sense that fundamentally we are together in the world
yes yes hi beauty
and so we can have an experience of being together in the world
in seemingly separate bodies that recalls the great communion of all beings
and so softens the barriers between us and the great waters
communion and love and mutual concern
adoration glory sweetness
I hope this cat isn't lost sometimes when cats are lost then they uh
yes and they're
much more demonstrative of friendliness
but it seems
that this cat lives here
I just can't tell for sure yeah it's a little bit skittish and that makes me
concerned that it's lost
but I'm hoping that it lives right near one of these houses we'll see for how long it follows
it seems to want to hang out
so that's a honestly good sign
I don't want to be too forward and go knocking on doors
but of course I want the cat
to be safe
because I already love it
so isn't it ironic that the very consciousness with which we form questions and concerns
about nature and identity and the fundamental reality of stuff
I don't want to use the word things
um could mountain assault on its own root
now there's different there's at least three important ways to think about consciousness
things are revealed in consciousness things are revealed as consciousness
and then finally consciousness is the fundamental ground of all experience and being
