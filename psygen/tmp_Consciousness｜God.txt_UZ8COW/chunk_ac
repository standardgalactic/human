the light of lights the source of sources the heart of hearts
is consciousness in us or are we consciousness
experience the revelation of consciousness as being
primarily it was my goal to refute the eliminative materialists briefly
and call their agenda absurd
however again I'm really grateful that they exist
without them I might be deceived into thinking something like
oh there's not really any such thing as consciousness
this is all just a vast mechanical accident
my mind is an epiphenomenon of the function of my body that ceases entirely when my body dies
and things like this ideas like this
none of which I believe seems wildly unlikely to me that the death of my body will be the end
of my it will be the end of the participation of Darren
my embodied self in awareness probably in in waking embodied material world awareness
and I don't know precisely what happens after that
but I have every reason to suspect believe and know that the end of my body
is not the end of the processes and intelligences and histories and futures
from which I emerged into embodiment
I do consider it a mystery I don't claim to know what the truth is
and in fact unless we have an experience of it it's just speculation or it's mostly speculation
with some intuition involved
when I had a chance to gaze into the great mystery of being
and have the great mystery of being gazed into me and walk hand in hand
in wonder and adoration and awe
my primary concerns were not about death and the continuity of my being
they were about life
and healing the damage in our in the minds of our species
on earth so that we could not be in such terrible traps of language and concept
and ideology
I wanted to render the barrier the barriers permeable again so that we could all
go to the great water at will and remember ourselves and our origin
and our fundamental communion our intimacy not just with humans but with all beings
in all of time
the great waters exclude no one and nothing
they don't even exclude nothing
it seems to me that consciousness is a result of participation
in the hyper structure of all beings in all of time
and the being who dwells in unity and perhaps particular organs so to speak in that being
there seems to be an aspect of the being that dwells in unity
that not only gives rise to minds in animals and humans and perhaps other life forms
or mind like processes
it participates directly in those processes
or they participate directly in those processes
and so our mind right now is
inseparable from the divine beings
they are participating in it directly moment to moment without that participation
we would not have minds
we can become aware of this it's very uncommon
many of us suspect something like this but have no or little direct experience of it
and some of us are passionately seeking such experience
so that we can understand
one of the peculiar ironies of human thinking and particularly linguistic thought
is that
understanding is rare and overstanding is common and this is what's going on
when the eliminative materialists say there's no such thing as consciousness or awareness
those are just figments of your imagination
things you've made up words about
that are actually just the result of the mechanical processes of your biological vehicle
or the biological vehicle
and thus they would say
in the shadow version of the enlightened language there is no union
but they mean a very different thing
you don't mean you are the transcendental origin
you are that origin right now
they don't mean that
they mean you're just a figment
both schools of thought would agree that you or me is a figment
the Buddhists and Vedantists would compare this figment to a kind of dreaming
you're having a dream of a separate self
the scientists would say there's no basis for believing in a you
well some scientists would say this
some some philosophers would say the idea of you is just a delusion
but there's a difference between a dream and a delusion
here they're not exactly the same thing
when we're stuck in language we're farther from the we just
it's so hard to get closer to the truth by using words
what we need is a direct experience of our true nature origin
the great communion the great waters of being
and water is probably the best metaphor so that's why I keep using it
when I speak and make these recordings I'm making an attempt
and I'm also trying to understand my own thought and capacities for articulation better
um
I succeed to various degrees against my own standards
I made a recording last night that I'm not very happy with and I'm not sure I'll post
and in this recording I'm not particularly pleased with my result the results either
but it's my goal to explore and when I'm exploring it's a bit like wandering around
in a forest there are moments of profound success where I feel ah yes this is what I was looking for
this this stone with the tree sticking out of it here on the side of this mountain where I can see
vistas and birds this is what I was after and there are other moments where I'm just trying to
figure out how to get somewhere
and consciousness is like this for most of us much of the time
frisky dirt it's hilarious
I agree that the dirt is frisky but I don't think it's just mechanical dirt
I don't think I mean we talk about the laws of the universe as if there's some law giver
but whatever's going on in the universe isn't laws laws are a human idea
and they're not rules either because rules are human ideas
and whatever's going on out there transcendentally I think we as human beings um academically
particularly clinically and scientifically our understanding
is catastrophically misfounded because we don't know the first thing about anything
we don't know the most important thing to know before you start making further cuts in the manifold
of identity and if we knew that if we could get ahold of that what is the most important starting
place the best first move a truly trustworthy first move then we could make progress but without
knowing that and we don't science certainly can't find this we're going to be trapped by our purposes
in making cuts and in a way we will get further and further from the truth rather than closer and
closer to it obviously our species is catastrophically confused because most of what we do is a consistently
aggravated self-expanding assault on the nature of life on earth that's not
the activity of an enlightened species that's the activity of a catastrophically confused species
they're attacking their own origin most of the time and finding new ways to do that all day every
day that game will fail and it's not even really a game it's a disease
but there is hope some of the ancient traditions are brilliant
there are profoundly altruistic wise human beings walking around some of them are little children
some of them are old people some of them are young people middle-aged people in every culture and
walk of life we find reason for hope and we can become that hope and perhaps that was my primary
concern when I was walking in and with the great waters of being during my experiences
may we render the barriers permeable together in ways that are wise kind friendly and intelligent
thank you for joining me I look forward to learning together again very soon
