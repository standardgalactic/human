the earth is quite resilient and would, for example, survive the loss of our species,
or even most of the species that presently exist.
It's possible.
And yet there is a solar season in which a living planet must develop organisms.
And that season is not eternal.
There are particular seasons of the sun and living worlds.
And this was another topic that the companion spoke at length with me about, although it
never spoke in language.
What it did was share its own experience.
It was like not telepathy, something even more profound.
It was like having a mind together so that my human intelligence could experience what
the companion's mind knew and had experienced, as though it were my own experience.
And yet what was going on in my mind was a modest subset, the subset that my human intelligence
could encompass and survive exposure to.
These living things, the living places, the organisms of earth, all of them, the ecologies,
these are, in my view, in my position, the evidence of what I speak of.
They are extensions into material form of something far beyond material form.
And they are expressions of the characters and qualities of the intelligences that live
outside of time.
And I have reason to suspect that these living beings actually are connections.
They are like receivers and transmitters that have both an aspect inside time space
and one outside time space so that they can lead us beyond if we understand how to relate
with them non-verbally, non-conceptually.
Again, the great silence of nature in the verbal conceptual dimension of human intelligence
is both a staggering mystery and a very important clue.
May we follow that clue together and discover something beyond everything we've ever imagined
with that verbal conceptual mind.
May we re-establish the old relationships if indeed they are good and true.
And I have every reason to suspect that they are.
Thank you for joining me today.
