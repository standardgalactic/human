We believe that a woman fell from the sky.
Okay?
Now, we look at the pictures, and at a time before the Earth existed as it does today,
the man beings lived in a place called the sky.
Okay, there was no land, there was just water, and they walked amongst the clouds.
Okay.
Okay?
Yeah.
I could get into the aspects of why, but a pregnant lady fell from the sky.
Okay.
And as she fell, the geese took her upon her back because they didn't want her to get the water.
There was no land.
Okay?
They flew around till they saw the turtle.
Okay?
Yes.
They landed on, she sat on the turtle.
Okay.
The turtle spoke to the otter, the beaver, and the muskrat to go down to get some dirt,
because his back was not comfortable for her.
Okay?
The only one that was able to make it down and back was the muskrat.
Okay?
He brought back the dirt.
Okay?
It's magic soil.
Okay?
She had the powers to make it grow, and she planted seeds and stuff that were in her dress
when she fell from the sky.
On the back of the turtle?
On the back of the turtle.
Okay.
Okay?
This turtle, the land grew and grew and grew, and becomes what today what we call Turtle Island.
Yes.
Which is what you know as North America.
Okay.
Okay?
That's Turtle Island.
Yes.
Okay?
The lady had a baby.
Okay?
Okay?
As the story goes on, as the girl grew older, the West wind came along, fell in love with
her, and impregnated the baby girl with twins.
Okay?
She had twin boys.
Okay?
But while in the womb, the boys argued.
Okay?
One was a good, one was bad.
Yin and yang.
Every culture has a win and yang.
Yes.
Yes.
Okay?
And the good boy was in first in line to be born first.
The mischievous one didn't like this.
So he came out of his mother's side.
Okay?
Which killed their mother.
Okay?
She was buried.
Okay?
And from her body grew squash, beans, and corn.
Okay?
Which we are known as the three sisters.
Okay?
Because they came from the mother.
Okay?
Of the boys.
They're the three sisters.
Okay?
From her heart grew tobacco, which we burn to send us our messages to through the period.
Okay?
Right-handed son, which is the good son, was known as a straight up.
Always told the truth was good.
He created all the stuff which is helpful to man.
The animals have provided food and everything, the bees which pollinate everything.
And he was also given credit for actually creating that.
Okay?
He took the soil from the earth, made dolls, and blew the spirit into them.
Okay?
And this is why it's known as Mother Earth.
Because he created us from her.
Took the earth and created us.
Yes.
Okay?
Now, the left-handed brother, he always was jealous of his other brother.
So he created all the things, the predators, and mosquitoes, and anything that would bother
man, which was the other brother's favorite creation.
Yes, yes, yes.
Okay?
So he created all these things.
Well, this caused a rift between the two brothers.
They had a major fight.
The right-hand won.
He banished the left-hand to the night.
The good controls the day, the mischievous control the night.
That figured he wouldn't be able to get in much trouble.
He can't see too much.
Okay?
Upon hearing this, grandmother spoke very roughly and angrily to the right-handed brother,
not knowing what had gone on.
He decided, well, grandmother always favored him, so he took her head and put it into the
night sky, which became the moon, which is grandmother moon.
Okay?
Took her body, put it into the oceans, which became all the fish of the sea which feed us.
Okay?
That's a very abridged story as to how it goes.
Okay?
But that's why the native cultures have such a connection to the earth.
Yes.
Okay?
The earth is all being to us.
Okay?
Nobody owns the earth.
According to us, we can't understand how people can say, this is my earth.
Because once you're gone, the earth is still here.
What we are is just caretakers.
There's all these disputes over land claims and everything now.
Okay?
It's not so much that we want to own the land.
It's more or less, I think, we want to protect our land.
I will be doing this mural a little bit more intensely, a little bit more story on the wall.
On a big scale.
It is our creations.
The main creation story will always remain on the wall.
But the other walls, I will paint and document the story.
Then we'll photograph it, document it.
And it may remain up for a season.
And then I'll change the story.
