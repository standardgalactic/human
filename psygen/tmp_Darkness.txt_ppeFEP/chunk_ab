just as we might think in the desert there is no more water the water has been taken from me
we may think i was bad i made a bad mistake we may have all kinds of judgments or narratives or
whatever but we will greatly mourn the disappearance of the water
now the people of the desert know where to find water they're like people with whom
there is nearly never light but they know where to find light when it is sparse or very very
scarce the people of the desert will understand about water
and this of course is the fundamental metaphor behind frank herbert's book dune
but that's not where i got it
times of great darkness come upon us and they don't just come upon us individually
since we have very little meaningful collective conversation they could be upon us
populationally and we would not know or have no way to cope with that because we have no
traditions or knowledge about how to do such things except largely you know medical knowledge
of how to keep someone alive for a minute
in other words every night all the people dream and what if we woke up in the morning and we
spoke about our dreams what if we had the tradition of doing this every night well then we would begin
to sense a kind of weather the weather of the in between of us the weather together
and this is the thing we are doing the opposite of in our modern cultures and so from
because we are missing this most of us are blind and even if we are really good we are
still mostly blind because we don't have the group sensing that is natural to our kind of animal
except in very limited situations a popular one we might think of is a seal team
that executes complex very dangerous military missions successfully with great frequency
but there are many others there are beautiful ones there are cooperatives of artists there are
people who dream together all the time as our species always did
there are children who play games that transform the nature of time space
that look just like silly games to the adults walking right next to them
there are jungles there are forests there are oceans there are whales for the moment
all these beings are with us
so in a time of great darkness when the water disappears and when we are so used to being able to go to this one place in ourselves or in our life or in our situation and find the light to keep going occasionally what happens is that that light disappears completely and in fact it may have become terrifying or ugly in its disappearance
then at these times
which are very fraught with peril and fear and complexity and confusion at these times
we can learn to recover the sense of the one who dwells in the desert within us
and these are very subtle senses because when the light is disappeared you have to be able to sense very subtle light
and so if we are just overwhelmed with superficial concerns and awareness and running through our habit trails
then of course we will not sense the subtle light and we will think oh my god the light has gone away
but always there is a transfer of potency between the brightness and the darkness and so when the great darkness comes
we can learn together to seek the potency in the darkness itself and find the other kind of light
the darkness
that reveals the darkness's beauty
the beauty in the darkness of the superficial situation
take a car crash where two people are dying
suddenly there's been an accident
this is all terrible and bad
but in 15 other dimensions something absolutely incredibly beautiful is happening
it's just that we're looking at the car crash and we're very focused on the light
is the living people and saving them perfectly good focused
but because we are so focused on our standard thing as they pass away we may miss the beauty
we may miss the beauty
there is a deep meaningful shining in the darkness and it is alive
and so when one aspect of a situation turns horrifying
there is always another aspect where the light is singing beautifully
and we may be confused or frightened or lost
and perhaps we should sometimes be
or grieving or addictive or any of the things that we can become when we are placed under
really powerful stress
but always the light is shining in a place where we if we will look
if we can fish in the darkness so to speak
we will find the signal we will find the compass it's just the inversion of what we're used to
chasing right it's like a 180 degree turn north has become south well i've never listened to south
okay let's start listening to south now yeah
i use light to see oh really let's use darkness to see now
anyone who has walked in a wild place at night where there are no lights knows
that you can use darkness to see it's a different kind of seeing
but if i'm busy being upset that the light is going away or the terrible catastrophe has happened
which are all things that actually happen to us i'm not denigrating them they are they are real
things in their layer but the layer in which we make meaning in our hearts and in our souls
and in our relationships in the world these layers are not a physical light
there are some other things and there are analogies to physics in those layers
there's something resembling gravity our habits my habits have great gravity upon me
if i do not work consciously to escape them i simply crystallize into them and then i stop
developing so the light is the position outside my habits that can see my habits and say oh
here is a habit i'm enacting it oh what if i did any other thing right now
and in times of great trial we can fish in the darkness and we do this best together
much better to know what's going on in the dark water with five or six fishermen
fisher people
fishers
much better to know this way
so we have the option
to realize that when the light goes out and we are at our most vulnerable
our most confused our most frightened
we can turn the compass around and look for the beauty look for the grace find and become
the ecstatic structure breaking moment that is actually happening beyond everything we think
we can follow the brightness inside that darkness
and then we will realize the light has not has not disappeared the light has transformed its
polarity it's still there it's just in the place we never look for it because we're so trained
to the lamp and the candle and the flashlight and the headlight and the television and the smartphone
in the great darkness in the terrible pain in the crisis
there is the brightness of incumbent mystery the mysteries of birth and death and light and time
and minds and dreams all of these things they are being revealed
in the place we are not trained to look all the places we are trained to look away from
especially because we are very compelled by the appearance yes if the appearance is grim
and terrifying and painful
then we can miss the great moment of beauty in the transformation
of life to death of habit to crisis of joy to fear of calm to anger
for each of these transformations so natural to us
is largely composed of the inability to move awareness to another focus
and I am like a little child and I am stubborn and confused and I can't do the things I say
except on rare occasion but I notice them and I notice them now more than I ever have
and so I've been fishing in the darkness for years now and I tell you there is light in there
and that's what I've been fishing for
perhaps you may find some I hope that we can together
we have great dreams of such things but my circumstances are as humble as anyone's
bye bye for now let's look in the darkness together
