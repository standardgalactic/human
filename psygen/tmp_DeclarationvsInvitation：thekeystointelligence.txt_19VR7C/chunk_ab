We will never again play the victim role ever once.
We'll never waste more energy on it.
And we'll still be able to love each other and adore life and feel all the feelings we want to feel.
We just won't have to preserve them in bank vaults and defend them against all comers and spend most of our lives feeding things that are functionally vampiric.
Yeah, it just doesn't work.
So this is an exciting idea because simply by turning around and facing forward into the invitation, we become the conductors rather than the prison guards.
What a fascinating possibility, not just for each one of us of our cultures.
I hope that we can explore that together and I look forward to many more amazing writing sessions.
Thanks for joining me.
Goodbye for now.
