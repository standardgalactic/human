I saw a meme, not a huge fan of memes
but it said that my son
when I was putting my son to bed he was talking about something his teacher had said earlier in the day
and she said something like
imagine that there is a pond and the pond is filled with fish
and let's say there are eight fishes and the fishes are feelings
be the pond
not the fish
and I think
the meme ended with primary school has come a long
way since I was a kid
and this is
the kind of thing I am talking about with practice
we can make a bigger bubble of the self
and when we make a bigger bubble we are free
we gain degrees of liberty that otherwise
without
which we would be trapped in a very small self
and strangely as we begin to react to things in our lives
whether we react
joy and hope and faith and wonder and awe and love
adoration, affinity
we like these things
because we feel like we are expanding
they release
inhibitions and limitations and we feel
deep and open
and capable of
joy and self development and nourishment
and that's natural
however there is a bigger bubble than that
too
and strangely my concern is with the things that trouble us
for these feel like we are being squished
I am being contracted
strangely if we think about our pupil
the pupil in our eyes
in the presence of more light
the pupil contracts becomes smaller
the less light it dilates
becomes large
once I remember
an African American woman came to my home
she was delivering groceries and we were talking a bit
and her pupils were extremely dilated
and I mentioned to her
very dilated and she says oh yes people often
comment on this they think perhaps I'm on drugs or something
and I said no that's not what I was thinking
but once she told me that this was a common
experience for her that her pupils were almost always
dilated wide open could barely see
her iris
and she said oh you know
we're from this place in Africa
I can't remember the precise place
and I said I wonder if
your ancestors were so used to being in bright sunlight
that over time they developed the genetic
predisposition
to oh that's actually backwards
isn't it
that's funny never realized this
having a little moment of insight here
oh no I had it right
where you lived
where your people lived the sun was so bright
your pupils were almost always contracted very small
and here where we live the sun is so much less bright
that your pupils naturally
dilate right they expand
and she was fascinated by this it had never occurred to her before
and I felt very happy this was a moment of affinity between us
we were having a little insight together and it was beautiful
it's hard for us to
know
the history
our ancestry
the developments
in our genome and so on including our microbiome
that predispose us
to certain kinds of environments which we may no longer inhabit
now the humans travel all over the world
they leave the context in which
for perhaps millions of years
certainly hundreds of thousands of years their bodies
were adapted to this particular place
the intelligence of place
and how our bodies naturally evolved
within that situation
and adapt
I'm at a lake
in which people play with toy boats
and this one
that I'm looking at is a hydrofoil
and it's a boat that rises up out of the water
on legs as it accelerates
producing less drag
from the water meaning the hull
and expansion is like that it's like less drag
more freedom, more degrees of freedom
so
it can be very useful to practice
in the face of fear or pain or isolation
and just allow a bigger bubble
of self, the self, our awareness, our heart
our feelings so that
the pointy thing that's hurting us
or disturbing us it dissolves
it just becomes one star in the constellation
and then one star in the galaxy and then one star in the universe
it's okay, we're okay
now this is easy to say in words
it's very simple to say oh just make a bigger self
it's not so easy to do but as we practice it
and as we repeat this practice when we come to
a place where we are stuck and frightened and alone
and disturbed and angry and confused
eventually it becomes more natural for us
to dilate the self rather than contract it
and that dilation lets
more light in
it lets more light in, more of the light of our original nature
more of the light of our intelligence, more of the light of our freedoms
and our potential freedoms
more openness, more space, more love
more compassion for ourselves and other beings
this is a very powerful practice though it sounds quite simple
in other words it's not a simple thing
but with practice it's a bit like working muscles
we become
more flexible
and better able to
work with challenging circumstances
and eventually we may even practice this with
affinities
so that we are not so attached to the food that we like best
that we cannot enjoy other food
there are amazing possibilities here and this is
a feature of the practice of mindfulness
maintaining awareness, openness, flexibility
not grasping at what we like and don't like
at least less severely
releasing the grip, the gripping hand of
the small aspect of mind and self
that is very reactive
and really it is this reactiveness that is the source of our pain
more than the actual situation
with people who are deeply practiced
they are often able to
place themselves in a state of mind
where for example they can have surgery
without anesthesia, now this is a very
extreme example
of the possibilities
within the purview of our humanity
to have this kind of experience
these are skills we can develop
but developing them depends either on
what we bring to our human birth, what we develop while we are here
and then also
whether or not we practice
mindfulness and awareness so that we can
make very big bubbles in a situation where otherwise
we would be profoundly constrained and in pain
suffering
and this isn't to say, this isn't to make any value judgments
oh those people who suffer, they are just not developed enough
that's not
mindful, that's a weird
misapplication of rationality
and what I'm speaking about is not closely related to rationality at all
it's related to something far deeper
than anything rationality can get at
so it's important, this little feature of what I'm talking about
that we are gentle and generous with ourselves and we realize
that I am at the place in development where I am at and that's fine
that's good
I will keep developing and I may
decide to practice mindfulness and awareness
particularly in situations where I feel triggered
and if I really want to be skillful
in situations where I feel attracted
because nobody wants to get rid of the good experiences
we'd like to keep those, I like the food I like
I like the girls I like, I like the cars I like
the games I like, the books I like
the ideologies I prefer
no one wants to get rid of those but
practicing there can also be very powerful
a bigger bubble where
I am not so compelled by my affinities and disaffinities
and so I have more freedom and
I may begin to understand
ah
I am not
merely this very small
earth that I ordinarily identify with
I am vast as the universe
I am all the beings in all of time and not just the material beings
