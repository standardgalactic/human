I am origin
I am God, I am goddess
and not in the egotistical way, not in the thinking way
but the direct experience of this
I am inclined to grasp and grip and identify at all
I am beyond gods and goddesses
I am
the undifferentiated potential from which all things arise
a vital dynamic living
field of origin and expression
again, not as a thought
the thought will not help you much
except that you may pursue it
the desire for
liberation from the small self
is powerfully beneficial
when employed intelligently
you know, in case you think
for example
this is all very interesting what Darren is saying
I've heard it before in other forms
probably true
yet what I actually experience is
what I actually experience as the small
self in my body while I'm awake
the raging angry noise of the motorcycles
that don't belong in the park
is real to me and all this fluffy stuff that Darren is saying
is just a kind of fantasy
I am just me, I am just this one person here
well, isn't it interesting
that when you dream
you're probably almost
never alone
your mind becomes not merely you
but the people and circumstances and situation and the world
with which you appear to be interacting with in your dream
so when left to its own devices
so to speak, I don't really like that trope
when left to its own natural way of being
our minds create worlds
and they create other people
and all of the people in the dream
are the expressions
of the original light of consciousness
or awareness or origin
being differentiated
transforming, having adventures
and of course there are many kinds of dreams, there are dreams with no people in them
there are dreams with no places in them
there are dreams with no light in them
there are dreams that happen just in darkness
but usually when we think of a dream
we think of something that resembles
what I'm speaking of
an imaginal adventure
an imaginal universe
and notice that in our dreams our emotions are different
the way we experience things is not the same as when we are awake
there's a intrinsic fascination
going on
even if it's troubling
there are many many hummingbirds here
and many other birds but the hummingbirds kind of stand out
because of the extremely high pitch of their vocalizations
vocalizations
there are lakes here
in Golden Gate Park and right now they
are wrong
I have a strong disaffinity to what I'm seeing
the humans have put some kind of chemical in the water
there are thousands of water birds and fish here
and other aquatic organisms
and the water is the wrong color
it is too green blue and this is because the humans have put chemicals in the water
and it's bad
the humans think they have to control the growth of undesirable
organisms you see and it's really weird what affinity and disaffinity
become at the level of our cultures and societies and institutions
because fundamentally there's no humans in there
it's a weird and
rather terrifying array of processes
that just unintelligently keep spawning behaviors and processes
that are lethal both in the sense of forgetting
like the River Lethe in which we are
dipped between lives and forget
in the mythical stories
of probably the Greeks
but also lethal in the sense of killing
just unconditional devastation
that seems to have some organizing idea behind it
which is usually the control of novelty
the limitation of novelty
the imposition of what we think is more
predictable and thus good and cities are made of this
and languages made of this and my actual initial
urge here
which I may touch on briefly
is the problem of nouns
you know if we ask what went wrong
with human cognition
in the biblical story
we are given a word
and the word is knowledge
but before we can have knowledge
we
pretty much have to be able to name things
and that naming
is problematical in the same way that
the bad chemistry and the water is killing stuff
the naming
and particularly the nounal
aspect of knowledge and linguistic behavior and
consciousness is deeply dangerous because
once we have a noun
we end the big bubble and we make a tiny little bubble
that is a token
and we fall under the delusion
that we now know what something is
because we know it's name ah there are some ducks
since I know their name I know what they are
but one thing it's impossible for them to be ducks
whatever they might be has nothing to do with this word duck
nothing oh there is a koi in the water
oh a koi I know what that is it's a fish
all we're doing is traversing
a semantic tree
and thinking that the cuts we make give us
power over the things we name
and this has been a complex mess throughout the development of human cognition
if you know a thing's name you have power over it a magical power
and this power is
enacted and embodied in our human societies where
your name is sort of like a slave caller for the societies and the institutions
they track you and trace you and charge you and bill you
prosecute and persecute you
in all kinds of ways and nearly never
is your name a blessing in this sense
until it is spoken by one dearly beloved
then you know there is something beautiful
there
why do I say that the noun is a problem
well
in older languages
identity was understood in
a transforming way
a verbal way process
transformation this becomes that becomes this
and in this sense we have freedom
from
the tiny self
I hear a raptor's call
the trapped
little tiny bubble that becomes
constricted over time
because if I am transforming
if I am relationships rather than static
things
the apparitions that nouns produce in consciousness the figures and
figments
then it's hard to hurt me
if you hurt me here I travel there
my awareness travels where the hurt is not
it becomes all the unhurt things
and also things that cannot be violated
in ordinary ways at all
or maybe things for which it is impossible to violate them
they are inviolable
so one of the fundamental problems
particularly for those of us who speak English
and more particularly for those of us who only speak English
rather than a much older language
or an indigenous language
is that we are trapped in a world of nouns
static identities
static identities, quantifications
descriptions, evaluations
and we are partly trapped because
this is the world that nounal
behavior linguistic behavior
imposes on awareness
this world is false there is no such world as that
or if we are to admit that there is some degree of relevance there
it's merely a denotative relevance
it's just I point at this with this word
the word does not tell us what the thing is
what the being is or is doing
even if we attach some few qualities to a duck
oh it flies, it eats things in the water, it swims, it makes eggs
a house, a bill, and so on
these are trivial representational things
again having nearly nothing to do with duckness
and what is duckness actually? it is a great mystery
it is the entire universe appearing before us
all of time and space, all the beings who have ever lived or will live
appearing before us in a form
that is of origin and the great unity of all beings
in a way that's somewhat magical
it's certainly non-ordinary to our regular ways of thinking
and also the duck is a process and the duck is
