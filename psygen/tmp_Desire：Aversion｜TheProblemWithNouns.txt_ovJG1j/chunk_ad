relationships
the duck is transforming
not merely a bird, not merely an organism
not merely a being, not merely a word
so these nouns are very deceptive
they give the representational aspect of our minds
the impression of having encompassed
the identity of something and seeing that identity
is static, extremely limited
possibly utilitarian, oh we get eggs from ducks
or we can kill ducks and eat them
or ducks are pretty and bring beauty to the little pond outside my house
this kind of thing
yeah it probably is
I followed you, but I'm not blaming you
well we all follow each other a little bit
sometimes to something good
where are you from? Brazil
well welcome on behalf of the San Franciscans
I'm walking to the ocean
it's a long journey
it's very nearby, can you hear it? yeah, we're close
yeah I started way back on 8th Avenue
I live over there, it is
I love to see the water though
that's right
I was just trying to avoid the street
exactly
what brings you to San Francisco? Game developers conference
yeah I've built a few games in my time
roleplaying games
oh no kidding, yeah I was playing D&D back probably before
you were born
do you work on any specific project may I ask?
yes, we released Dungeons & Dragons Ark Alliance last year
in a few years we'll be releasing your Dungeons & Dragons game
oh wow, that's exciting, I play Neverwinter
it's not very good
back in the day it was pretty good, but they got to do it in the age period
fundamental to D&D is the idea of random encounters
and there are no random encounters in Neverwinter
none, zero, all the encounters are preset
I think our next game is not going to have random encounters
but I think there are many facets
even a big discussion was, is our game going to have character customization
some people are saying that's even more
so I ended up encountering
a friendly soul
and having a long walk
and talk on the beach with
Igor
who is a game developer
and a fascinating person
I think we got a few miles in
in the surf
and almost got knocked over a couple of times
and the arc of our conversation
has
made it a little difficult for me to recover
my previous thread, though I remember talking about nouns
and the strange
they're a strange relationship with identity
they're easily grasped
by the
representational aspect of cognition
and this aspect is
inclined
is somehow right hand like
for those of us who are right handed
it's the gripping thing
and once it can grasp something in this way
it feels a sense of oh now
I know
completely what something is, does, is for
and so on
so there's an even tinier, more constricted self within us
a linguistic self
and its concerns and way of being in the world
are extremely limited
but seem to it to be almost omnipotent
so it's multiply deceptive
the old verbal languages
where identity and meaning and relation
were consistently brought to mind
even in single words
whose particles
brought into awareness
marriages
of being in situation and relationship and time
night and day, hot and cold, male and female
up and down
in and out
all these things were in constant transforming relation
and so the old languages were much richer
and our fascination with and vulnerability
to nounal consciousness and thinking
has led to catastrophic deprivations
in our capacities for understanding and intelligence
while at the same time providing us with the strange
complement of technological advancement
and you can see that in technological advancement
is there's a vast propagation of things, objects
millions of little packets of ketchup
700 different kinds of packets
tomorrow 900, the next day 1000, so on
endless cars and boxes and machines and rectangles and books
and advertisements and logos and companies and so on
imagine living in a culture where there was none of that
there was no such thing
as a fake identity
a corporation, Honda
city bank, facebook
and no images
except perhaps the sacred sand paintings
or
the images on our huts
or teepees that reminded us of the world of origin
few or no representations of identity
what a great relief that would be
a great relief
to return to the biblical story
in the Garden of Eden, a story I think which is
much richer and more profound than it appears to us
and
some evangelists might opine on
what is meant by this word knowledge, why is it the tree of knowledge
that is the problem and what happens thereafter
but fundamentally what happens is that
we lose our direct experience of
and participation in interbeing
and so we are trapped in a kind of death
which is the constriction of the small self
the I, the me, the location of my body
the circumstances of me alone and against
the world
and this is a kind of death even though
as the serpent
equivocates
with Eve in the story
half true
but over time your people will
die inside to their experience of participation
in the great
living dream of the cosmos
and it seems that
the possibility of naming things
is a fundamental
catalyst of this ongoing
sort of living death that we experience
ever more profusely in
modernity
so this was my initial
thought about what I might speak about today
the trouble with nouns and I suspect
that Ian McGilchrist in his new book
The Matter With Things
probably explores this very deeply
the thingification of experience
breaking it up into
little distinct isolates
that are understood as static
this is the fundamental problem with nouns
is that they make static that which is fundamentally dynamic
and they make local that which is fundamentally relational and distributed
and so we begin over time to perceive
in light of the form
proposed and imposed
on mental experience by nouns
it doesn't have to be this way
and if we become aware
of this together we can retrieve
some of the degrees of liberty that have been lost and possibly
prevent new degrees of liberty
but first we must have this awareness of the problem
we must be able to understand that in a deep way
not in a superficial way
but knowing the name of something is really just a lexical token
it tells us nearly nothing about what it would mean to be in deep relation
not just with the duck
but with the entire living place
the continuum of all beings in all of time
our true family, our true home
what we might call the world of origin
or the domain of origin
that timeless source
of not merely light
but the astonishing
and miraculous modes of light
that give rise to
our minds moment to moment and throughout our lifetimes
that give rise to living places
and organisms and ecologies and relationships
these are the natural expressions of a form of something we could refer to
light but it doesn't just mean the brightness
very difficult to speak about these things for our language
is not inclined to develop
the features
and ways of speaking
that would be helpful here
what I hear mean by light
