how shall I
possibly approach this
is
the ecstatic
primordial
wonder, adoration, dynamism
and transcendental
transcendental
oneness, unity, communion
from which universes and beings
emerge as natural expressions
and instances
of this communion
all of this is lost to a noun
a noun posits a world of
separated distinct things
objects, moments, transactions
and it carries with it
a library of implied values
and also something like the opposite of values
that we will ignore once we begin playing
in the world of names and catalogues
and categories and so on in this way
it is these things that are ignored
that are most essential and worthy of resurrection
to our awareness and consideration
all fascination and wonder
it's been a long walk
now night is falling
the fog is coming
things will become blurry and indistinct
the imagination will rise
as the sun sets
and soon will be the time of dreaming
thank you for joining me
I look forward to learning together again soon
bye bye for now
