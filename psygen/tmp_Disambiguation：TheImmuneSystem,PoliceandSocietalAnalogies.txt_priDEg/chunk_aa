Hello everybody, I'm here at the San Francisco Botanical Gardens, family of ravens here looks
like some young ones, they're practicing their pleading behavior, you can tell they're young
in various ways, one of the ways you can tell is that they're too big right, young ravens go
through a phase where they're kind of awkward, and the one down there, the largest one, largest
looking one, is all fluffed out. I'm both a little excited and a little bit nervous today
because I've got some very interesting things to share with you. It's also a little bit strange
to be back inside the Botanical Gardens, which is the living place I am most intimate with around
here. The Botanical Gardens here are world gardens, because we have a peculiar kind of climate,
many plants will grow here that ordinarily would not thrive in other kinds of climates,
and so the gardens are broken down or organized, it's interesting that organized and broken down,
these are synonymous, they're broken down into specific countries, so the garden is a bit like
a microcosm of the world, and that's both beautiful and unfortunate because it's beautiful in that people
who visit here have a chance to see plants from all over the world, it's unfortunate for a wide
variety of reasons, including the fact that humans organize everything. This is an interesting crazy
woodpile that is pretty new. Lots of things have changed in the gardens since I was last here,
although I was last here covertly, and I'm going to select a path through the gardens based
primarily on avoiding other humans so that I won't have to keep putting my mask on and off
or my handkerchief actually. Having to put one's mask on and off is much more dangerous in some
ways than not having a mask or just having it on all the time, of course we wear masks to protect
others primarily. This is a crucial point, grievously overlooked by many opinionated people who think
we shouldn't have to wear masks, they'll claim the masks don't protect you, yes they're not for
protecting me, they're for protecting others, in case this isn't clear. Some people are bold enough
to claim that there isn't even a virus. It's complex claim. Is there a flower there?
Does it slightly resemble the pictures we've seen, the representations of the coronavirus?
Whether or not there's a flower there is totally up to you, right? You can determine what to call
that or not, but it seems pretty clear to me and I'm quite skeptical in my own way that
there is a very dangerous viral contagion circulating among the humans at the moment.
Its origins are not clear, they have not been proven. No one has proven that the virus comes from bats,
no one has proven that the virus doesn't come from a laboratory.
What we have on that front are mostly opinions, and I've seen research that supports the fact
that the virus probably was not assembled by humans piece by piece, that's almost certainly
not what happened with the novel coronavirus, which is the virus I'm talking about.
However, there is research that supports the perspective that the virus's peculiar
affinity for human ACE2 is very unlikely to have become as sophisticated as it is
via a single leap of mutation, and that could mean all kinds of things. One of the things it might mean
is that this has not been really explored in research, this is a perspective from someone
who works in biomedicine myself, is that the virus circulated among humans before the primary
outbreak and mutated over time to enhance its affinity for human ACE2, that's conceivable.
Another possibility is that the virus was produced purposefully
in a gain of function research, which we are aware the Wuhan lab is involved in.
This looks like to me a pipeline swallowtail caterpillar
that may be preparing, I can't see what the camera captures when I turn it, I'm going to try this
again, so I think this is a pipeline swallowtail caterpillar that may be preparing to create a
chrysalis, and this right here, this little tiny black thing, that's the skin of a caterpillar that
previously did that. We are in the flower moon, the latter part, latter half of the flower moon
of the Blackfoot phenological moon cycles. This is a chrysalis, this is an evacuated chrysalis
right here, of, let's see if I can make sure I capture this,
there we go, that's an evacuated chrysalis of a pipeline swallowtail, and on this side
here, you may be able to see the little strands that connect it to the to the stone.
There are two connecting points,
one at the bottom, which is kind of gluey, and one at the top,
which is more of a strand, it's like a little loop, oh there's juice inside it, wow,
it must have opened very recently, the strands at the top are incredibly strong,
hmm, I wonder why there's so much juice, it looks like blood, but there is no creature in there,
there's no creature in there,
but the chrysalis is empty, I did not harm the creature, though I wanted to
take the chrysalis off the stone, I wanted to see how strongly it was attached,
and I was very surprised, the strength required to remove the abandoned chrysalis
was significant, much greater than I had imagined, I don't see any, that one caterpillar that I
showed you, is the only one I see, I'm not seeing any caterpillars on the pipeline itself,
oh wait here's one,
so here's a pipeline swallowtail caterpillar,
it's eating a piece of pipeline,
it's a pipeline swallowtail caterpillar, and this place here is seeded with these
by a young man who works at the academy of sciences,
this is a chrysalis that a butterfly, so had a little interruption there,
and I'm not sure if I got to show, here's another pipeline swallowtail caterpillar,
eating a leaf of pipeline,
and I'm still very surprised by the amount of liquid
that was left in the clearly abandoned chrysalis here,
all right, and how strong the little strands that attached the chrysalis to the stone
that it emerged from are, I have one of these at home that somebody detached some time ago,
and I took it home and attached it in a way that should allow the butterfly to emerge if it
wasn't killed by being detached, perhaps soon I will find out,
you'll notice where I, later you will notice where I connected these two videos because
my iPhone became full, here are a few more instances of the pipeline caterpillars,
I saw an extremely tiny one, and at the moment they're very kind of silky,
they're kind of silky smooth, there's an astonishing number of them here today,
and it's interesting that at the same time, obviously the chrysalis was just vacated because
it contained, first of all I could see that something had emerged from it, the chrysalis had
broken open, and I could determine that the creature inside had vacated the chrysalis,
so it became a butterfly, but in the bottom of the chrysalis was a reservoir of blood-like
substance, which I'm certainly not afraid of, oh I just scared a butterfly away
that we could have took a look at, but it wasn't a pipeline swallowtail,
it was sunning itself, so this little location in the gardens
is seeded with pipe vines by a young man who works at the Academy of Sciences here,
and he's a fascinating fellow who cultivates pipe vine swallowtails,
this is one of my favorite plants, it's referred to as hummingbird sage,
it's very sticky, you can see how things stick to it, I'm just so excited to be back in the
gardens that I'm more closely attending the living things than my agenda, because
the living things are certainly profound enough to preempt my agenda,
and living beings here, they are astonishing, pretty sure there's a hawk up in this tree
because the some of the smaller birds are responding as if there's a nearby hawk,
all right,
so I have a couple of topics in mind today, and they relate to a recent situation with
what I'm going to generally refer to as catastrophic cultural dissonance,
not that our culture is regularly harmonious, that is itself is an illusion
produced by layers and layers of regulating fiction and narrative that we lay on top of
what's actually going on, mostly to hide things like omniside, atrocity, cruelty, rape, violence,
hatred, ignorance, there's a human monkey in here apparently, so yeah there's all these layers of
fiction, right, and media, a number of human monkeys, the media makes money by
crafting and reinforcing narrative fictions, humans use narratives to structure identity, role,
relationship, value, memory, and that last one is really the crucial one,
even though it's perhaps the most nuanced and subtle, we employ narratives
as a kind of shorthand that keep us from needing to do very difficult work,
disambiguating situations, phenomenon
that we encounter or participate in, oh the scent of this brugamencia is just
overwhelming, overwhelming today, devil's trumpet, angel's trumpet, you get to pick,
oh my god, beautiful, one of the things I was going to say earlier is that the garden is kind
of tragic because there are so many exotic species here that they're, it's all good,
that their natural relational symbionts are missing, so the insects and birds and microbes
and other plants that would naturally symbios with the plants from all around the world
are not here, and that means that many of the organisms that live here
live without the possibility of much like we do, right, we live in an abstracted,
regularized, box-like context of structured fictions instead of living with each other in nature,
and it's bizarre to say that we aren't living with nature is like saying that my fingers aren't
living with my hand, it's that, that's how intimate the actual relationship between our people and
nature is, so when structured fictions and behaviors and roles and corporations and
governments and religions and political factions, ideological factions, when these intrude
into our lives so severely that we primarily become their exponents, right, we just become
expressions of them, we lose our humanity, our intelligence plummets to something barely
recognizable as intelligence, and the fact that we're capable of using language to describe or
explain or model or simulate things actually becomes a deficit rather than an asset,
and this is the condition that all of us find ourselves in to some degree, for some of us this
degree is unimaginably severe, for others it is relative to those people more, you know, more
modest, but we, our supercultures aren't us, I want to be really clear about this, they're more
like an emergent phenomenon of our behavior, in fact the idea of culture really isn't any such
thing as culture in the same way there's no such thing as Buddhism, right, Buddhism is a word that
refers to a variety of practices and behaviors and exponents of a ideological or practical
tradition, right, but you can't find Buddhism, right, what you can find are writings that could
be classified as the product of Buddhists, you can find people meditating in a fashion that would be
understood as Buddhist, but you can't find Buddhism, and in the same way there really
isn't anything like culture, culture is a shorthand word we use to encompass a vastly
sophisticated multi-layered, multi-dimensional, constellated, array, or matrix of phenomenon
behaviors, identification, so on and so forth, so our culture doesn't really exist and this is part
of the problem we think it does, right, and we believe that the multi-layered tower of mostly
lethal, meaning causing you to forget and also toxically deadly, fictions that we are referring
to when we use this word culture, these are largely invisible to us unless something causes them
to jump out at us, right, unless there's some relatively significant event, right, that produces
a highly visible and sometimes shocking disruption, then, and only then, to the majority
of people, and the majority of people is also a weird construct, then and only then,
do vastly larger numbers of people begin to pay attention, and when this disruption happens,
they all try to form bizarre explanations as to why it occurred and justifications for it,
or to vilify it, or so on and so forth, all of that's entirely natural except that
it isn't doing what it pretends to do, right, primarily what is getting done is that those
multiple layers of narrative fictions and descriptive fictions are just sort of having
a little earthquake, they're just reorganizing tiny little pieces of their structure in a way that
largely sustains the overarching narratives, right, and slightly modulates some of the little
sub-narratives. In case it isn't obvious, our species has reached the point where that kind
of behavior will no longer suffice, and what's going to happen, no one can say exactly what's
going to happen, but in my perspective what's most likely to happen is that our willingness to
believe and enact these fictions has set up a cascade of catastrophes that are beginning now
for the first time to emerge into more or less common consciousness. We've been aware of these
things for 50 years, I've been aware of them since I was a child, since I was five or six.
People like Rachel Carson who wrote Silent Spring about the devastating impact of DDT on the ecologies
in maybe the 50s, 60s, and 70s. People like Alvin Toffler who wrote Future Shock,
one of the most brilliant and prophetic books I ever read as a young child, I think I read that
when I was nine, these people announced what was coming in very clear ways that were unambiguous,
profound, demonstrable, shocking, provocative, and absolutely worthy of our attention.
There wasn't a we to ignore them. There wasn't really any kind of structured we. The we,
quote-unquote, that we have is another fiction. It's a fiction of largely victim-like membership
in supercultures. And those supercultures are themselves vast leviathan like monolithic
fictions, much like the idea that we might have of Babylon, or some of the images I've seen,
drawings, old drawings of artists' interpretations of the Tower of Babylon.
I'm at the little pond where I sometimes practice frog sneaking, and there were some frogs here
the last time I was here, but I did not hear any today.
So the problem is that our supercultures and corporations and nations and military
industrial complexes and prison industrial complexes, which actually schools, what we
call schools, are little sort of mini prisons, even though we pretend otherwise. I saw a picture
on Facebook yesterday from schools in Nigeria where young men were lined up 30, 40 at a time,
lying on their stomachs waiting to be flogged by their agriculture teacher, or their geography
teacher. And so a man was standing over them with a giant bat-like stick, and he was just
going to beat these people, these poor young men. And that helped me remember
that what we call schools are largely preparation for a prison-like
experience of life beyond them. And although it isn't obvious, one way to understand the
weird diseases that we live in and call our culture is as seed beds for prisons.
They're meant to produce prisoners, and this is why we have the nine to five,
this is why we have police in the military fighting wars that are largely invented,
this is why the combined budgets for our prison systems and our military
so grossly outweigh any other investment as to render those other investments nearly meaningless
in comparison, dollar for dollar. So I want to talk about two, I've got kind of two topics in mind,
and I'm beginning to introduce them with by discussing this layered fiction situation that
we're in, and how some of those fictions are beginning to be penetrated. And it's because
we've been able, the reason that we've been able to sustain these fictions is that nature and the
poor have been absorbing the damage caused by enforcing them for a good, you know, for many
hundreds of years, it's always been this way, in colonial society, right? We offload the damage
that we'd otherwise be blatantly aware of onto, we hide it in nature, and we hide it in classes
that lie below the most privileged. We hide it in the poor. They're the ones who take the damage,
they're the ones who get poisoned, they're the ones whose lands are stolen. If they don't have wealth
and weapons, we wipe them out. And we also, I think our culture, our American culture,
is fundamentally founded on piracy, right? So what that means is that the big pirates eat up
the small pirates, and the small pirates feed on whatever resources they can get until they build
up enough value or wealth that it attracts the big pirates, and then the big pirates come in and
steal all that and wipe out the small pirates and absorb them. And in case you think this is
unlikely, just watch Facebook absorbing things like Instagram, you know, Snapchat, TikTok, whatever.
You can see this process at work. And we used to have laws, I can't recall the specific,
the specific aspect of law, but we had like anti-monopoly laws. And we still have them.
They're just not really enacted with the same, with sufficient ferocity to make them useful.
So that one man owns most of the newspapers in the United States, that guy's Rupert Murdoch.
And essentially, in an array of situations that resemble something like the factions of Star Wars,
