a better chance of modulating it. Now, that's not the only way to see it, but it's one important
perspective. And this is my goal, is just to present us with some perspectives that will be
useful. I'm not trying to say this is how things are or I know how they are. I don't know how they
are. They're far too complex for me to know. And yet, I have noticed things. And perhaps together,
we have noticed something that we can attend in a way that will be mutually beneficial, useful,
and perhaps give our ancestors and our progeny something
that won't be merely a tragedy, something that might be beautiful enough to celebrate together.
I dream of a society more intelligent than our technologies.
And corporations are advanced. I dream of a society
humane and noble and intelligent enough that we can truly be proud of it together.
Thank you for spending time with me today. Bye-bye for now.
