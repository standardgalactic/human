in comparison to the relatively minimal benefits it confers.
Because we will learn to disambiguate in ways that deprive us of intelligence, of freedom,
of the capacity to forge meaningful, noble societies together, or at least the inclination
to do so.
Not the capacity.
Let's have the capacity.
We will enter a world filled with premade tokens and representations, and most of us
will believe in it.
But there are infinite worlds, near at hand, beyond that constricting prison, that the
tags we learn to believe, to propose, to assert, to fight over comprises.
So let us become conscious together of the powers and capacities with which we are born,
and how our common habits with language, knowledge, society, identity, and purpose deprive
us of these abilities, and how perhaps those very same powers can return them to us.
Our world, and our people, all the people, and all the living beings depend on our ability
to awaken to something resembling the intelligence and nobility of which we are capable as human
beings.
May we find a way to stand all our ways together, to move in that direction.
In that tree is a beehive.
Bye bye for now.
