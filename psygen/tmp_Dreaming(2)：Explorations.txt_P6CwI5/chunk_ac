right and this is one of the things we can learn from our experience of psychedelic drugs that's
useful if we will pursue it without them right if we will pursue the disciplines that allow us
to change the shape and sort of resonance of our waking world consciousness we will discover new
faculties that for example there are indigenous people who in their culture it is said that they
have dream seers who can actually see what another person has dreamt they can see the
sequence of images at least and interpret it now to see the sequence of images is not the same as
seeing a dream because in a dream identity has extra dimensions of meaning and connotation and
suggestion and this is one of the really profound things about dreaming is is that
in the world of a dream the nature of identity is radically transformed and the necessity for
matching with waking world identity dissolves it's not there such that my sister can be a man
and and there are added to not added to maybe in the waking world they are subtracted or something
our experience of identity becomes
imbued with astonishing depth
and domains of meaning and connotation and character and implication and suggestion and
and so on and in our in our waking world by the way the child has something of this
in their experience of play yeah so when children are playing what they're actually doing
is investing their physical experience with the kinds of extra dimensions of meaning and character
and circumstance that a dreaming mind does but they're able to do it while they're awake
and we you know it is claimed that we grow out of this that's not what happens what happens is
it gets buried under layers and layers of normalization representational cognition
and the loss of dimensions of meaning identity character circumstance relationship
that is the result primarily of our exposure to formal representational cognition language
and culture and over time what happens is that repeated in structuring
buries the faculties that children use to play that they employ in play
and so too for those of us especially who are not artists or have you know powerful creative
outlets we lose fundamental aspects of our relationship with imagination and when that
happens there are profound repercussions psychologically metabolically in our character
so on and so forth
so it is said that in some cultures there are
people who have practiced the art who have acquired and practiced the art
of seeing into the dreams of another after they have had them
now certainly we must imagine that the people who have had dreams can remember some of their dreams
and thus would know if the dream seer
was able to actually do this or not right and although the dream seer might see into dreams
they the dreamer could not remember they would also see into dreamer dreams that the dreamer
could remember and thus the faculty could be validated now I recently had a very astonishing
experience where I had had some very important unusual dreams and a nightmare
and later that day I was very excited to meet a body of living water
which I will not name and whose name I do not know because the human name of this body of water
is not that body's name it's just what the humans call it
and when I got in the water of the lake it was very cold at first and I was expecting that
well very cold is relative it wasn't freezing but it was quite chilly and after two or three
minutes of adjusting to the temperature and becoming comfortable with it suddenly two things
happened I began to re-dream dreams I had had the night before including dreams I had not
recollected upon awakening and I felt this incredible powerful living pulse of something
I don't know what to call it other than the essence of dreaming as if this body of water
were filled with this essence and it awoke that essence in me caused me to re-dream dreams I had
the night before and filled me with this profound astonishing sense of non-ordinary
awareness and this is what I mean when I say we don't need drugs for this yeah and drugs can
damage or interfere or wrong foot us right we can they can put us on the wrong path I think
our our our natural faculties are much more trustworthy than the experiences we would
ordinarily have when we introduce drugs I'm not trying to tell other people what to do
I'm simply being honest about my own experience and concerns I want people to have
direct conscious experience of non-ordinary cognition and consciousness awareness and faculties
without being intoxicated and then if they've then had that experience and they want to experiment
briefly with with drugs I'm a little more open to that but I think there's a lot more damage
that ensues than there is progress from most of that behavior and so I'm highly skeptical of it
and I have had both kinds of experience right I've had non-ordinary experience that was
essentially imposed by drug use the use of psychedelics of various kinds um and then
I've had non-ordinary experience that was natural to my waking state consciousness not imposed by
drug use and the latter was I mean a thousand full deeper than anything that even very powerful
psychedelic drugs ever got close to um so it's not only that not now not all of my non-ordinary
waking world experience that wasn't associated with intoxicants was super powerful some of it was
very subtle and gentle but some of it was so staggeringly overwhelming that I could barely
survive it I want people to have the experiences that are available to them with their natural bodies
and consciousness and metabolism before they are exposed to the imposed non-ordinary cognition
of psychedelics so that they can tell the difference right and so that psychedelics doesn't
get there first and thus predispose them to expect kinds of things
or to look for certain forms of experience that actually don't matter they're not
particularly important or even useful they're just exotic right and there's lots of phenomenon
like that in the world right there's lots of phenomena super exotic but it's not very useful or
or healthy to engage in it doesn't get us anywhere yeah and if we we can become addicted to that kind
of thing we can become addicted to the spectacle to to the shiny you know surprising seemingly
novel stuff and and in so doing we can overlook the the fundamentally crucially important insights
and clues and motivations that would otherwise lead us to success
so these are some of my concerns about that but it does seem clear
that dreaming
dreaming suggests an array of non-ordinary faculties and in many cultures dreaming
is associated with either the soul again where do you make the cut right some cultures will say
there are nine different souls associated with your body some will say there are 37
some will say there are there are 10 right I mean some will say three
but dreaming is associated in almost every culture with phenomenon that in English we
would refer to as either metaphysical or spiritual I think the cuts we've made in English are very
crude and we should be cautious about them right the delineations we've made in English
are insufficient to properly expose us and motivate us for exploration
so we should we can use them but we should recognize how incredibly limited they are
and how limiting they can be if we believe them to be sufficient or complete
so on and so forth
and it's not necessarily a fact that we need new language although
new language sometimes can be useful it's just that I want us to see that the
the narrow delineations that we have in English are the result of cultural models
and knowledge traditions that are unfriendly to non-ordinary experience
that are essentially domineering in that they want to dictate the identity
and the nature of possibility our faculties so on and so forth
and we should resist that right we should we should see through that
at first we will explore where there is no language to help us yet
as we seek the faculties senses and forms of awareness that our unimaginably sophisticated
gift of human incarnation brings brings with us and it's it's really tragic I think
you know in the west us moderns maybe around the world we're we're dying inside because
the light
the light that nourishes our human hearts and and consciousness and awareness
has been dimming for thousands of years as these faculties have fallen away
as these experiences and traditions have disappeared and been replaced by representations
that are essentially like plastic dolls compared to what they represent and many of our modern
religions have this unfortunate status yeah whatever they might have originally referred to
is gone from our experience and so all that's left is this sort of domineering representation
that's contagious as all hell but relatively ignorant and maybe even lethally toxic and that's
very unfortunate um however this is part of the problem with our human relationship with
representational consciousness and particularly with formal representational cognition that is
the inclination to encode identity in tokens trees of tokens and relationships
that are insufficient to even point toward the identities thus encoded and over time continue
to degrade in a fashion that resembles lossy compression um in computing terms if you take
something like if you take a video and you compress it in a lossy way right where you're
going to lose half the data in the compression and then compress it again in a way where you're
going to lose three quarters of the data and then keep doing something like that eventually you get
just a mangled mess of nothing there's no data left right and pretty short order too and this is
one of the problems with our relationship with representational cognition and with what Korzybski
would call time binding alfred Korzybski the author of science and sanity which is the inclination
to pass on traditional um models concepts and tokens generation to generation there's a woodpecker
again a different one i think though i've noticed one in this vicinity for the past few days and
i suspect we must be approaching mating season for these creatures in this in this you know where i
live so this is part of the problem with representational cognition over time and particularly
it's unfortunate but both science and religion have deeply contributed to the lossy aspect
of our relationship with with concepts ideas identity names um characteristics
dimensions of character functions and dimensions of functions these have been crushed down to an
incredibly narrow and uninhabitable array of reference as time has has progressed time binding
is the the passing on to generation uh to each new generation of of the well of of some portion
of the previously conserved knowledge of uh ancestral peoples so for an example for an example um
a friend of mine who is an indigenous man
is involved in indigenous ceremonial activity and he told me that
one of the people who taught the younger generation some of the ceremonial songs
was so old that he could barely sing and since this was the only person the young
man could learn the songs from they learned to sing them the only way you can really learn
is to emulate them they learned to sing them like an old man who can barely sing and
someone who actually knows the songs cannot sing with these people because
they one cannot even understand the words that are in the songs they are mangled and the young
men are singing like an old like an exhausted old man because they're they're emulating him whereas
the songs should have like this vitality in them this sort of pulsing vitality that's necessary
to move our to change the shape of our consciousness right and this is one of the techniques
i won't call it a technology because i i don't see it as that it's something very unusual it has
features of function and identity that we don't have language for in waking consciousness you know
we might say it's supernatural that's insufficient um that's it's the wrong word it's
i suppose i could come up with some term but it's not the term we need it's the experience
right so the ceremonial songs of ancient peoples and the ceremonial traditions of
ancient peoples are one of the places that we can find inspiration and intelligence to pursue
the explorations that will help us to recover the faculties that are natural to our waking
consciousness and yet inhibited by it and are the likely produce
of something that resembles the opposite of lucid dreaming
and that opposite is not lucid waking again we're missing language here and i'll need to invent
a neologism a new word for what i mean but what i mean is the intrusion of the dreaming
conscious the meaningful intrusion the coherent intrusion of the dreaming consciousness into our
waking world experience without collapsing it into a dream and ceremony is authentic ceremony
is one of the techniques with which we can produce such transformations
and explore them and these techniques also deeply affect will generally deeply affect
our dreaming mind and again this is something i've had thankfully i've had direct experience of
so space is not the final frontier awareness is the fundamental frontier and that will never
change and i suspect that there are forms of awareness that would allow us to explore space
without the need for vehicles and to explore of course space is time but to explore space time
and to participate in non-local temporality and spacetime both with the faculties implicit in our own
human nature but also those available by relationship with other intelligences
of kinds i cannot name for we have no language for them and yet i know them to exist
and they don't merely exist far away they exist near at hand
hidden from our ordinary awareness in the ecologies the insects the animals the plants
the microbes with which we are surrounded and of which we are composed
a profound adventure awaits those of us willing to participate in this exploration
and it's not without its dangers but in my mind in my view the dangers of the
catastrophically narrow and nearly uninhabitable
consciousness most of us experience while awake and working at jobs and so on and so forth
that's a far more dangerous thing and produces endless catastrophes of result
our modern societies are soul toxic they're soul killing
and we must i believe recover the hope of something that nourishes our interiority
it's very loud hawk
going to pause for a moment we need we need to have experiences
authentic experiences trustworthy coherent experiences that nourish our interiority
and that
refresh and revitalize our dreaming
no one's going to do that for us we're going to have to do that
within for each other together we're going to have to do that for ourselves
and it takes some courage and some passion and some curiosity
but the dreaming mind is made of those so it will naturally be attracted to
these these tasks and one of the dangers is that the waking mind loves narratives right
loves models and explanations it wants things it can grasp and manipulate and it can become
very domineering in this sense so that we are prone to keep developing theories right
that is not what i'm after at all in fact that's the opposite of what i hope for
and that would be really that's a really dangerous that's one of the real dangers of this
kind of activity is that the waking mind just prefers stuff it can hold on to
and and grab on to and manipulate so it loves theories and narratives and descriptions and so
on and so forth that's not what we need we don't need theories of dreaming we need the return of
the faculties that underlie dreaming and the faculties that are dreaming aspect can
resurrect in our waking awareness consciousness and experience yeah
so we should be cautious about theory formation we should be cautious about narratives
we should be cautious about explanations we see so much of this kind of produce in
in our culture in the media that surrounds the topics that we have
gathered together under the rubric of the paranormal right endless theories and models
and stories and narratives and so on and so forth the same kind of thing conspiracy theory
is the same you know is another domain where narratives and concepts and models prevail
um and i want us to be very cautious about that kind of thing in our
explorations in our attempt to recover some of the faculties that i've here spoken about
i think there was there was in my mind a few moments ago by the way the attempt to remember
something i think is is related somehow to dreaming um and our experiences of meaning
