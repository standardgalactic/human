one that's hard to pinpoint the cause of there appears to be, I mean I have some theories about
cause, for one thing you can't rip the ecologies apart and have human minds remain coherent,
human minds are an expression, even an extension of the incredible diversity of life on earth and the
ecologies so as those get burnt down we're going to get dumber, fast too, really fast.
And each of us will be affected or not affected and you know affected and unaffected in unique ways
because there are very few situations that affect everyone the same, each of us is uniquely embodied,
uniquely temporalized, we are we are time beings and it's almost as if each being and each being
that composes each being like each of my cells is a unique bubble of time in a temporal hyper
structure and a biorelational hyper structure and so effects reach each beings at different times
in the same way that the people at the beach are destroyed by the tidal wave immediately,
the people inland it takes a little longer, the people far inland will experience repercussions
of the tidal wave it may not be destroyed by it and so on.
So I think a lot of trouble is coming and some of it is certainly the repercussion of the actions
of our collectives and in some ways the individuals that compose them but not to the same degree
because the individuals don't really have the capacity to generate harm
at the scale that our collectives have been you know have been engaged in.
So in the time of greatest crisis and trouble we may be deprived of the very assets we need to
understand and navigate it that and it's possible that we could assemble them together
because I think what we're going to find is that collective human intelligence is going to
become a high priority in the future. We're going to need to be able to generate intelligent
collectives to produce and nurture them and protect them even if the scale is small even if it's a
you know 10 people or something. It's absolutely crucial that our species
step out of the historical idiocy of empires and nations into new forms of human
communality and intelligence and we are well prepared for this evolutionarily
but we are poorly prepared for it situationally so far. I have some ideas about what we might do
perhaps someday I'll get to pursue them if my mind survives this mess and I find a few allies
perhaps not I don't know
but it's my hope that we will be able to do this and of course with the people that
I am close with I'm always reaching for let us learn to see better and more deeply together
and to grow and to protect each other and nurture each other love each other lift each other up
you know out of the blindness and confusion that is our ordinary experience of modernity
you
so this is a bit of an abrupted video but it's been so long since I made one that I
wanted to just take a few moments this evening and speak with you all about these things
I have any other notions on my mind but um
perhaps I must wait for another day
that is the great entrance cypress an incredible being that is probably at least 100 years old
maybe we should do the canopy walk around the canopy with this tree
what an astonishing tree I love this tree so much I mean I fall in love with trees
that's drop of a hat I don't actually know where that phrase comes from
um and this tree has a beehive in it it's right in that crack right there
you might be able to see a few bees
in there maybe yeah let's do the canopy thing
I'm gonna go all the way around the tree
it's awesome
all right you beautiful souls
may you be lifted
from anything that binds you and freed from that which traps you
and safe from that which harms you
encouraged reassured loved
may you know the fulfillment of the promise of your human birth
may you naturally embody the virtues much love bye bye for now
you
