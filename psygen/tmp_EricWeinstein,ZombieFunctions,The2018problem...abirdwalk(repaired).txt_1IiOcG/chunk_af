And simply we tend to have these two polar divisions, jobs and recreation, jobs and entertainment.
And both of those are highly captured and dangerous in their modern formats.
So we have to reestablish both and perhaps make a mix where we play at doing things together
that are noble and true and virtuous and brilliant and hilarious and amazing
and resurrecting, rescuing, healing, nurturing all these things.
We have to play at forming behaviors of these sorts together and then enacting them.
Or so I strongly think.
I suspect the distant music is spooky and haunting.
I want to thank all of you who have traveled with me today
and those of you who will travel with me in the future or the past.
Please take a moment, if you will, to do what I won't hear request.
But you'll understand what I mean.
I look forward to learning and exploring together again very soon.
May your world and relationships be vital, beautiful and inspiring.
Until next time, bye-bye for now.
