Hey everybody. So I've just been listening to a conversation that I've been
following for the past couple days now on Eric Weinstein or Weinstein. I'm actually
sure of the pronunciation of his last name since I just heard someone
pronounce it steen, but I always thought it was stein. And this is part of the
problem. You know we often, we like to correct people who mispronounce things,
not realizing that many people who mispronounce sophisticated words at least
are not mispronouncing them because they're dumb, they're mispronouncing
them because they're smart. What do I mean by that? I mean that we presume they
might not be smart because they they don't pronounce the word in a way that we
know to be correct. When in fact what is more often the case is that they are
readers, they read. And when we read words we have to intuit the pronunciation
based on our experience and ideas and rules and thought and previous you know
readings and relationships with sounds and vowels and consonants and
ificatives and so on. So I'm not sure what inclines me to be unclear about Eric's
last name except that maybe I haven't heard him pronounce it or maybe I did
and it didn't stick but I think it's Weinstein. In any case he's on with Tyler
Cowan in Portal episode I believe number 16 and they're talking economics. A
subject that I would ordinarily consider to be not only outside my
bailiwick which a word which I may be pronouncing mispronouncing because it's
a word that I've read and I'm not sure that I've heard many people use that
word. As you can see I'm attempting to obey masking guidelines. Something that I
consider not only to be intelligent reasonable and good given the current
situation but also a matter of personal courtesy and communal unity. But I was
listening to this podcast on economics a topic far from my ordinary interest or
concern and listening to these two go at it together and of course they're not
really going at it. They're more or less cooperative. Eric likes to fight. He
makes no secret of this. Tyler thinks so highly of him and is such a gentleman in
a way an intellectual gentleman that it's very difficult for Eric to kind of
you know find a position from which he can strike and I can see that Eric will
actually admit that this is frustrating him right that he kind of wants to
have the masculine mano a mano right that Tyler's nature and proclivities
continuously deny them. So yeah I think Eric's a little frustrated and certainly
he disagrees with Tyler on many points however Tyler's such a brilliant
conversationalist that it's very difficult for see this is kind of a
thing in that one learns in Tai Chi over time. It takes a long time for most
of us to come to this position but my old Tai Chi teacher said something like
bless his heart the man who introduced me to the art
Casey Mao who passed away from brain cancer perhaps a decade ago he used to
teach in the concourse in between the museums in Golden Gate Park which is
where I met him and that was a that was one of the few truly great things that
happened to me here in San Francisco. San Francisco is a I'm going to veer from
my topic momentarily but I will return to it. San Francisco is a haven still to
this day for martial arts practitioners. Every morning beginning around 6 a.m.
prior to the pandemic and to some degree still to this day that little concourse
would become a very interesting avian interaction was going on here. That
concourse would become like a sort of pop-up university for martial artists
but particularly for people doing Tai Chi and the vast majority of those
people are doing Tai Chi for health not for combat whereas other martial
artists particularly those who studied Bagua an art that I have deep
admiration and respect for and wish I had the time to pursue. In fact that's one
of the ones I would pick if I were going to pick something other than Tai Chi now
recognizing I'm not a young man anymore and even young men are relatively
likely to get injured in martial arts such as Jiu Jitsu and part of I could
rephrase part of that is relatively likely to injure themselves but anyway
my point is that in Tai Chi my old teacher he used to say in order to be
struck you have to strike yourself against the fist of your opponent
essentially what he meant was you have to be so poor at following that you're
standing still when you should be in motion right and in particularly in the
art of Tui Shao which is the art of pushing hands an art shared by a wide
variety of martial arts but common commonly practiced particularly in
Kung Fu and in a relatively choreographed fashion in Kung Fu as I
understand it I have a little experience of that but also in Tai Chi and a
number of other arts they have Tui Shao which is pushing hands and pushing hands
is essentially the essential intent is to yeah this is like explaining what Zen
is for in other words you're fucked from the get-go if you're starting to use
words right it's just not going to work
Tui Shao in in Tai Chi as practiced by those I practice it with in a special
place at a special time it is an art of sensitivity and essentially the goal
could be rather clumsily framed as exerting no force yourself
unbalance let your opponent unbalance themselves in their attempt to steal
your balance now this is a very peculiar thing quite unlike fighting and it's
kind of the difference the reason I mentioned is it's kind of the difference
between the two potential combatants in Eric's portal podcast because Tyler
doesn't do what's called forming up against his opponent and because he
refuses he's so elegant at not forming up against Eric Eric can't really get a
punch in and and he's frustrated by this but he's also charmed right he's
enchanted at the same time in a way that's entirely masculine right I'm not
claiming that um he has he's got you know like an erotic crush on his guest
because it's certain that he's doesn't and you know he is a he's married to a
female so but men do form men do become enchanted by each other and one might
argue after observing them very carefully that in fact their enchantments
are often much deeper and heartier than the relationships they are inclined if
heterosexual to form with women and in their discussion there were a number
of comments about the complexities of the of attempting to use language
judiciously wisely and effectively in the age of political correctness which is a
I think honestly and if somebody wants to have a discussion with me about this
I'll happily you know presuming that we're both there to learn I'll happily
participate but I think that topic is very complexly internally conflicted I
think it involves aspects of the policing of thought and behavior and norms
and things like this that I find deeply troubling and I also think that its
origins are much more confused and conflicted and untrustworthy than we
might ordinarily imagine if we're just listening to the people who are arguing
for it though that that group that I just referenced is a field it's not
meaning and this is something I want to get at something brilliant that came out
in Tyler and Eric's discussion those who are in favor of policing language and
thought according to what they believe is correct about the use of gendering
nouns and such like this that is a field meaning it is a library of unique
situations circumstances contexts individuals groups subgroups and so on
it's not a thing and in many of my recent videos I've spoken about my concern
about generalizations and today in listening to Eric he begins to argue
against certain kinds of economic methods analytical methods methods used
analytically in the field of economics methods traditionally used in this
fashion and he makes the claim that the very important claim to me that what
was required to actually understand the phenomenon being analyzed is field
theory rather than unit theory right and the example he gave is brilliant he
says you don't ask what is the temperature of the United States absolutely
brilliant perfect analogy just the one I needed when we talk about men or women
or animals or political groups or religious groups or consumers right we
treat that we are we are entrained by our habits with language and our
inculturation meaning the behavior of our peers associates and those we are
exposed to we are trained to treat fields as units right and so it is that
we are deceived by what appears to be our capacity to measure and measurement is
actually the problem I've spoken lately about statistics arguments over
statistics and so on but we have two perhaps far more significant problems
and those problems are measurement which we supposed to be objective and really
it's very rarely so and particularly in in complex things if we can exclude most
of the universe we can measure the remainder with some relative degree of
objective confidence but with first we have to exclude just about everything to
do that and that's really important we need to notice this weird quality of the
nature of measuring itself and when we casually measure things in consciousness
usually for purposes we've not yet admitted to ourselves let alone those
to whom our measurements will be deployed we make a variety of fundamental
errors in the belief that object you know that there is some kind of
objectivity available and this is one of the catastrophic redological fallacies
to which we are commonly subject this fallacy is used against us to make us
dumber by the news I saw today in a friend's news feed a remark that I
thought fascinating which was that Fox News has accomplished with our parents
what they feared would be done to us by gangster rap and that was a fascinating
little quip such quips are not particularly change making they're
entertaining but they do help us to comprehend phenomenon that are otherwise
relatively inconceivable it's very difficult for me to understand the
positions that my father holds until I recognize the context the information
context in which he habitually engages and how those contexts are skillfully and
intentionally manipulated to produce certain emotional and intellectual and
analytical results in my father results that can then be the simplest way to say
it is that can then be taken advantage of by parties intending to profit from
doing to benefit from doing so there's lots of different benefits not just
profit so Eric gave this fascinatingly wonderful analogy perfect one I don't
I'm sort of I'm disappointed with myself for not having come up with it myself or
at least something similar right and it's it's something I'm completely aware
of I was just never able to encapsulate it in an analogy so clearly you don't ask
what the temperature of the United States is and if you did what you get would
be an average which wouldn't tell you much about the temperature in a specific
place and averages don't tell us the character of units and this is
fundamentally important for all of us to learn and understand because our language
implies the opposite and we are so used to being trained and taught and rewarded
by people who pretend that fields have the qualities we associate with units in
other words that groups are individuals which is completely impossible the United
States is not an individual corporations are not persons they never were
they can't be in fact they're disembodied functional collectives where humans are
turned into functions for the purposes of profit shareholder revenue competitive
advantage and so on as I walk through the garden here the San Francisco botanical
garden I'm currently in the the redwood Grove I am traveling through a continuum
of temperatures in this place I'm standing now I'm relatively appropriately
dressed for the temperature if I am standing in the sunlight right next door
to me right here okay I am inappropriately dressed right because we like
convenience and because we like to think we've made the right decisions and so on
and so forth we want to be comforted by the fact that our intellect is you know
properly functioning we are inclined to eject the necessary detail to understand
or relate with a phenomenon effectively and efficiently intelligently
humanely and so on we're inclined to eject that detail and grab the
generalization now some of my astute listeners might find this to be in
conflict with what I was saying a little while ago about my objections to the
field of linguistic policing that I refer to as political correctness there
are aspects of political correctness I have little problem with some of which I
adopted as a very young man in the 70s and I'm sure there are modern people who
will absolutely will find some reason to attack me for what I'm about to say but
in the 70s I was educated by my mother to to prefix to use the prefix miss in
fact back then and I still think I think it still exists today there was a very
provocative magazine with that title MS period and it sounds like sloppy English
miss miss it's just it's hard to get the sound out of miss so I think that's why
we chose miss even though s doesn't normally have a z sound it's a little
bit confusing but I learned that it was perhaps inappropriate to distinguish
women by their marital status when we didn't distinguish men by their marital
status and I'd be just as happy if we did if we distinguish them both right as
long as you know there's some kind of some of the see here's part of the
problem some of the battlegrounds of equality are produce peric victories go
ahead and look that up if you want I think it's P Y R let's see P Y H R P Y R H Y C
but but look up peric I can't spell it I can only say it at the moment in other
words you know we we win some insignificantly symbolic first of all the
idea that that these topics comprise battlegrounds when we start there we've
already made the first wrong move and this is part of what was going on on the
podcast with Eric and Tyler is that Eric was being forced to realize that these
guys are going to cooperatively establish higher ground because Tyler is
disinclined to combat and is skillful enough that he can incorporate Eric's
apparent strikes into he can take that the momentum of Eric's intelligence right
and transform that into higher ground they can both achieve together instead of
pushing back against it and being hit right and this is what reminds me of
Tui Shao in their podcast and it's you know there's a lot of important lessons
we can learn about life we've heard from various spiritual and mindfulness
traditions don't resist right it is not that they that they mean they do not
mean necessarily though there may be some cases where they do again it's not a
unit it's a field generalizations have their use but are dangerous when
clumsily applied so it's not that they mean submit right that is not really
what is commonly meant what is meant is don't form up against something take the
momentum supplied and move to higher ground I saw a cartoon yesterday in which
there were two images of the same male and one of them was a male with 20 bricks
on his back this is one who's formed up against a problem another one was an
image of a male with on the 19th of 20 steps putting a brick down in front of
him this is the analogy of the difference between forming up against
