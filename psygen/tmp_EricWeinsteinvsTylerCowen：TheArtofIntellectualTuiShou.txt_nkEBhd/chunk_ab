something and using the momentum to achieve higher ground it's unfortunate
how easy it is to frame this idea in language unfortunate because to actually
employ it it requires either very careful and diligent practice and awareness
and it's it's the kind of awareness that the ego is unaccustomed to Eric is a
little bit egoic Tyler isn't so concerned about his position right and
this is part of why Eric wants to fight and Tyler wants to fly and Tyler is
able to enchant Eric with flying enough that Eric can't really get you know he
just he just can't bring himself to punch and that's that's the that's the
grandfather teaching the father there right they're both progenitors they're
both brilliant progenitors but here we see what true skill looks like and true
skill will avoid combat for higher ground every time right because the the unit
version of higher ground is I won the field version is we progressed right so
for Tyler there's no question here right Tyler's gonna go for we progressed
every time Eric's still kind of interested in I won and Eric is the is
the kind of a unique intellectual persona who is inclined to preserve little
grudges and this is one of the things that differentiates him from Tyler I
think though Tyler has like most of us do pet peeves he has intellectual and
philosophical concerns that he will clearly state and preserve and discuss
and present in a non-con generally a non-confrontational way however it
doesn't mean he never forms up against Eric often there's a kind of flow of
energy back and forth between twee-shaw participants before one of them falls
over right and Tyler does you know does push back in his own way but he's
skillful enough that even when doing so his position is hard to directly attack
and I think Eric's used to the direct attack so for this reason they end up
kind of dancing more than fighting and Eric at a couple points in the podcast
he he almost says like what the fuck you know I can't I fucking hit you right
and Tyler's just kind of over there smiling you know sagely to himself it's
a beautiful thing to watch very extremely edifying but for today in my
relatively brief video what I really want to point out is this analogy because
it gives me it gives me purchase on something I've been talking about but
I've been incapable of properly illustrating which is the commonly
deceptive way in which generalizations are employed in thought
language casual analysis and behavior now we can easily understand should we
so choose that the topic of racism emerges primarily from a traditionally
habitual and unsupportable mode of generalization and I would argue that
the generalizations that underlie racism are disoriented and misfounded in a
couple of occasions when when Eric and Tyler are speaking and they're talking
about touchy subjects such as the relationship of gender to economics
Tyler will say for example that when you really do the math it's not exactly a
gender difference in a very specific variable that I don't recall which isn't
merely pay gap it's demographics right where you live and in what
circumstances and what what social class and what economic class you belong to
and so on so forth racism comes from clumsy
misfounded in other words the purpose underlying the desire to make this
generalization is fundamentally wrong or broken generalizations and it's tragic
for me to hear my own family echoing
perspectives they struggled to protect me from as a child now my mother is gone
so only my father is left really but to hear him
to hear him regurgitating nonsensical ideas and models and
predestilled outrage from media owned by racists bigots financial elitists who
by themselves aren't necessarily evil is really challenging I adore my family so
much that I mostly overlook their you know the narrowness of their views but
my point here is that it's treating a field like a unit right if I say such
and such a race is responsible for these social ills and should be blah blah blah
I'm treating a field as a unit and I also may be conflating the relatively
desperate and or reasonably undesired behavior of some modest segment of a
population right in a field I may be extending that behavior to everyone in
the field so that for example if someone says Americans are racists well
that's the complex statement because it treats a field as a unity if you it treats
a field as a unit and then measures the unit and declares its measurement right
and it also it's absolutist it it judges every single human being including babies
and you know teenagers and people who are prodigies and people who are
developmentally challenged and and men and women and transgender people and gay
people treats them all with the same the same measuring stick one that
actually never did any measurement right and it pretends to have measured all
things and this is a really common problem in the way that we relate with
language knowledge and ideas we because we can draw a circle around something
conceptually or in language we then become filled with the necessary hubris
to suppose even though we've never actually measured it we know its character
and can declare that essentially as an absolute for all time to all people and
that is a catastrophic misuse of the possibilities of human intelligence
averages don't tell us the temperature of individual places or people and in
fact happy to be corrected on this little point it's a piece of knowledge I
get I gleaned from the internet I heard a physicist declare it is impossible to
measure the temperature in sunlight check it out and that may be because I
mean there might be a variety of reasons why that is so but one of the possible
reasons is that in certain fields of trend of like rapidly and constantly
transforming activity or character or behavior we can't get a solid grasp on a
single variable that is the result of a constellation of causes but language
pretends otherwise and this is how we use generalizations often most of us many
of us and in fact I'm doing it right now right I'm I'm generalizing about
generalizations did any of you notice that I'm treating generalizations as a
unit when in fact they are a field and I'm saying I can tell you something about
generalizations they're very dangerous now this second-order awareness is what
helps us to discover the problems we have with our relationships with language
and knowledge ideas measurement which is something I'm going to have to return
to in a later segment because although I'm not entirely out of time I'm close
enough to being out of time that I'm gonna have to head back toward my my my
little slave cubicle but I hope in in a future episode to examine the complexities
of measurement and a few of the things that I will seed your imagination with
before I begin that discussion is that are that we come at measurement from a
unique array of purposes with a with a unique array of tools in a unique array
of circumstances in a unique library of methods and our purposes affect what we
will derive when we collapse the incredibly cloud-like constellated nature
of reality person situations and phenomenon into a measurable derivative
and that is one of the great powers of our species that might get us killed it's
likely to get us killed the desire to produce a derivative the capacity to
collapse the cloud into a concrete deliverable that one thing is one of the
primary features of what I usually refer to as the waking mind by which I
ordinarily mean something like the inclinations of the left hemisphere and
it's particularly pernicious addiction to graspable tool like utilitarian
pragmatic abstractions so what we will find when we explore measurement carefully
is that it's not as objective as we had hoped in fact somebody asked me earlier
today what objective system do you use in daily life to ensure that your
understandings and behaviors are reliable I'm paraphrasing slightly and I
said I can't find any such objective system because without subjectivity the
idea of objective systems does not exist and therefore I don't understand the
nature of objective systems as absolutes something like this again I
paraphrased and rather poorly and my point was is that for all its apparent
reliability this idea of objectivity is a myth there are no objective observers
what we can have is a field of observers who agree either relatively or almost
perfectly on the outcome of an array of behaviors or methods a sequence of
behaviors or methods desired to produce you know employed to produce a result and
when everybody's experimental results generally agree we then call this
subjective and we believe that mathematics is perfectly objective yet it is
not without subjective minds mathematics doesn't work the attempt to place
mathematics on a firm logical foundation in the 30s and 40s by the logical
positivists failed and it was proven to be fundamentally a fundamentally flawed
purpose by people like Albert Einstein's best friend Kurt Goodall so let us bear
in mind that the the tools we use to arrive at things like certainty or even
worse truth these tools must submit to subjectivity and where
they do not they are untrustworthy we'll learn more about measurement together
soon I hope thank you for joining me it's a great pleasure to just have the
privilege of learning and growing and sharing together bye for now
