We spout their fictional proclamations, declarations.
And then we try to convert each other.
There's nothing deadlier than that.
A tree in nature is an interesting authority.
The sun is an interesting authority that does not speak.
Gravity is a kind of authority.
Light, intelligence, communication,
but they don't look like what we are doing.
They don't look like our beliefs.
They don't look like our ideas.
Before I go, I want to sort of invite everyone
to consider some really astonishing possibilities
that we've overlooked.
I'd like you to consider that our world
isn't actually a single world.
That it's an instance of all worlds
and every moment of every world in all of time
so that everything we do here
becomes our signature on those other worlds.
And that the animals and the plants and the ecosystems
are actually the living presence
of those other worlds and moments here on earth.
And that what we call our mind is a way of participating
with all of time, all of intelligence,
and all of space here as myself right now.
A way of being whole in distinction
and ever more whole in my own distinction.
What this means is that we've completely overlooked
99.9% of what it means to have a mind
or to be a human being or to be alive.
And as someone who's had a taste of
what that 99% contains,
let me try to explain to you that
if you were to get a taste,
you would forget about religion altogether.
You would forget about science
except as a pastime.
You'd have no interest in sports or films.
You would have an ecstasy
and a way of learning so shockingly profound
that never again could you know boredom or fear.
You would in fact know something like
the living mind of beauty.
And it is so powerfully intelligent
that in your first exposures to it
you will be hard pressed to survive.
We get a taste together
and I intend to ensure we do.
Thank you for joining me.
Bye bye for now.
