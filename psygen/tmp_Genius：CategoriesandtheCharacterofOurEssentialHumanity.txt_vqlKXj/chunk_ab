uh their opposite reigns supreme like a like a tyrannical overlay just like if you paved
a living place right this is the analogy of of what most human beings will experience of
their interiority because our cultures and the context to which we are generally exposed
reinforce
a process that resembles circumcision on the organ of ourselves in our souls in our hearts
that is
the organ within ourselves with which we relate with that genius with our own genius and with
the genius of others because the genius of others cat experiencing the genius of others
catalyzes memories and and a hunger in ourselves a knowledge that we too carry something like this
it's just so frustrated and inhibited that it cannot be expressed and again most of us will
live and die with very little experience of that although there are exceptions um in our lives
and one of the places where exceptions are common is in dreaming
but even dreaming our dreaming aspect is aware of this conflict yeah and it will present figures
that call us it will present figures of struggle and confusion and frustration
that call us back toward the possibility of reconnecting with with our inner genius
even though the the
even though it is as if the appendage like let's say
we're born with a special kind of wings and those wings lift us high enough
that our genius can reach down to us and we can reach up to it uh as if in that famous painting
where adam reaches toward the divine being and the divine being reaches down as if
that's a painting about everyone except it doesn't have to do with
the interpretations we've heaped on that image right it has to do with something
that's both universal and unimaginably personal just as personal as your own
relationship with your sexuality right except you have a capacity for relationships
with a form of intelligence that humans have been too timid to conceive of
and the origins of your mind are the result of your relationships with that intelligence
in childhood before you were before you underwent the process that that I would analogize as
as analogize as being circumcision right um and I think nearly all of us suffered dramatically
from that cultural process that circumcision and I think it's a tragedy and we can remedy
this tragedy and if we don't we'll be making a terrible mistake that will cause unimaginable
suffering and catastrophe we need to do something other than what our cultures have been scripted
to do for thousands of years which is essentially we need to be liberated from the paving over
of our capacities for intelligence and relation with living places and living beings
and living ideas we need to be rescued from this this pavement this pavement has to be shattered
and and the the green verdant vitality of the of all that is hidden beneath that cruel
inhibition
must see again the light of day within our lives and cultures
without being commodified without being sold back to us in little fucking packets of commodified
bullshit right um now when I speak of genius I'm actually talking about a subject that would
change the meaning of all human categories and there are such subjects and people who
we think of as geniuses since I've been using him as my stalking horse if I've got that language
right um I'll use Einstein right Einstein saw that there were fundamental problems with categories
that if if we get these categories wrong it's impossible for us to get anything right so one
of the goals that he had I think was just to apply I mean he had really ambitious goals but his
his simpler more accessible goal was to get us to think differently about time space light and
gravity because those are fundamental properties of that which is and if we've got those wrong we
can't get anything right and what I'm suggesting is that we have other of other categories wrong
the category of organism we've got that's wrong and if you get that wrong you can't get anything
right the category of human if it doesn't include the genius you've got it wrong and if you've got
the wrong idea of what genius is and you think it's a quality um peculiar to some specific human
beings who get lucky enough to embody and express it you've got it wrong right and if you get that
wrong everything's wrong there's a genius to nature there's the genius of that woodpecker
right that's making its call that drew me to this place and and was the fertilizing
catalyst of the video you're now watching
is that included in the idea of woodpecker in english fertilizing catalyst of prodigy no
and as I as I speak of this the woodpecker gets louder and louder as if as if it can hear me as
if it's celebrating being recognized beyond the categories we ordinarily presume to be sufficient
when they cannot be thus and will never be thus
there's another aspect of genius which is encoded in in the phrase genius low key
and that is the genius of a specific living place and we human beings belong to these living places
the way that wings belong to birds but unfortunately our relationship with knowledge
function value and commodity proximity place all these things have been so catastrophically
distorted that the only word I can come up with to describe such a process is amputation
right I've used the word circumcision earlier and this is a crucially important idea for me because
the intelligences we bring to birth as children are ready to they're they're poised they are um
perfectly prepared to acquire all different kinds of intelligent relationships with living places
with our genius with other forms of non-human intelligence with anything resembling intelligence
in human culture including language and knowledge and concepts and the stuff we acquire like a
disease that mostly shuts the stuff down cuts it off from our experience and access when we're
born as children it's as if we have I don't know I'll just make up a number say uh 173 different
unique um it's not an appendage what is it
we have a vast a wildly exotic array of unique potentials for contact and relation
with other forms of intelligence and it is the genius we bring into into birth as as children
that allows us to undergo the process of in-languaging and in-culturation that produces the crippled
version of ourselves that we refer to as a mature modern adult and that's a tragedy that I think has
to come to an end and it has to come to an end now not like someday in the future with some future
generation or maybe somewhere somehow someone will accomplish this we have to do this together
for the sake of all of human history for the sake of whatever future might be possible for our people
for the sake of the living places for the sake of the the history of and future of life on earth we
have to we have to accomplish this because if we don't the catastrophes that will there from ensue
are both unimaginable
and too tragic to evaluate
now one of the things that drew me today to this place
was that we're we're existing in this moment right now
in a very unusual set of circumstances
and one of the things that's happening for nearly all human beings right now
is that the fundamental bases that we use to derive identity value
meaning proximity
um opportunity threat reward all of these foundational elements that whose constellation
right we depend upon to determine what things are what they are for what can be done what we
will do what we shouldn't do what is good what is bad what is
prodigious what is ignorant all of these sort of um
all of these street signs all of these these pivotal inspirations
they have been tossed into chaos right they've been suspended
the the
the pivotal
as the stars were to ancient navigators the entire sky of pivotal navigational
elements has been completely thrown up in the air and is at this moment totally suspended
and what that means is both as individuals and as a as a p as you know a species and as nations
we are going to have to reestablish them and we're either going to reestablish the ones with
which we were previously familiar or we're going to do something a little smarter and recognize that
as we reestablish these uh way posts of of meaning and i and value and identity
we have the opportunity to do it in such a way that not only preserves
the inherent capacities for prodigy intelligence humanity kindness generosity
wonder awareness and awe that are
the unique gifts our ancestral
progenitors strove to bestow upon us
we can return
12 kinds of wings
to our minds and hearts and our capacity for relationships and that around which our human
societies orbit those markers of value and meaning and identity and reward and punishment and
threat and opportunity those markers represent a kind of gravity they are in a way like the sun
is they draw specifically character constellations of behavior out of human populations over time
if we change those we can change the behavior and we can recover the capacity to be an intelligent
species and that is a capacity we have long suffered without while pretending every other
thing and if that isn't obvious right now it never will be
it is always possible to raise the bar and it's always possible to raise it 15 rungs rather than
two and this is what genius is kind of about right it's it's kind of about the sense that
isn't necessarily proud or it doesn't need to accuse or denigrate it simply points a path
towards sudden unimagine previously unimaginable developmental efflorescence right you guys
we're dancing we're gonna take you from dancing on the earth to dancing with the stars okay
and not the ones on tv the ones in the ocean of the sky that are the origin of minds and beings
and life and the possibility of intelligence and much of our human capacity for for actually
intelligent awareness and understanding and behavior it's tied up with our relationship
with categories in language again if you get those categories wrong if you got the wrong idea what
genius means or the wrong idea what an animal is or your idea of the sun is far too limited to
have anything to do with what's actually going on in and as the sun if you break if those categories
undergo lossy compression which is exactly what's been happening or at least is a perfect analogy
it's a technological analogy that's what's been happening with the categories over evolutionary
over developmental time of human societies the fundamental categories on which knowledge
are based have been undergoing this incredibly um this rapidly accelerating process of lossy
compression and that means they lose dimensions of meaning right they lose dimensions accessible to
our awareness of meaning and relation possible relation so that one day the woodpecker is just
another bird it's not it's no longer a signal from eternity to the possibility of direct
relation with the genius of a place which is somehow an invitation to our own intrinsic genius
and prodigy and spirit and soul and heart when our hearts ache
that's a real sense that's a sense more subtle than vision but richer and older and deeper
and absolutely trustworthy it isn't that our hearts cannot be fooled into aching of course they can
and much of our media and what we call entertainment is depends on the capacity
to mimic prodigy and greatness in such a way that we become involved in a sort of reverse
projection game yeah where somehow the endlessly unfulfilled thirst this endlessly unfulfilled
hunger for excellence in the core of our being that is with us in every moment of every day of
our lives and is sublimated because it is inhibited and frustrated and often punished
or co-opted and commodified by our cultures this prodigy we carry is hinted at in stories
in films and we can be sold a kind of candy bar counterfeit where instead of reacquiring a
relationship with our genius and embodying that and fulfilling that we will settle for the rapper
we will settle for the appearance we will settle for the mimic for the mimicked
storyline right that is reminiscent of something we were born to live far more than
right now the fundamental pivots of identity and meaning are suspended
they're in unknown positions and some of them will fall back to earth
in forms in shapes that are worse than what they were before we entered pandemonium as a people
but we in our capacity to form intelligent humane skillfully motivated unions in that capacity we
have the opportunity right now and that may be a short window to establish something that
actually resembles intelligent human culture so that the inherent
the staggering array of inherent faculties available to us as human beings will be returned
to our common understanding awareness experience and embodiment and that is my dream and that is
the dream of my genius a genius that i was so lucky to have touched in this lifetime directly
and known in person a thing more astonishing than all the stories that i've ever been exposed to
in human culture by thousands and thousands of times more i can't express there is no hyperbole
significant enough to express the difference between the actual experience of of having that
moment however brief or long it may last when one's humanity reaches into an unknown dimension
high above the paved battlefield and makes contact
with its essence and that is a moment divine and that is the origin that's why we have
that's why we have all the mimicry that's why we have all this entertainment
that's why we have religions that's why we have technology
those things are the shadows
of our societal and communal failure
to keep that possibility protected and alive and to reward it and to revere it
not to overstand it but to understand it together
so that is my dream and i'm grateful to this living place and all of its living beings
and to the woodpecker that has so often drawn me out from my humble shell
into a situation where my intelligence feels at home perhaps yours does too
bye bye for now
