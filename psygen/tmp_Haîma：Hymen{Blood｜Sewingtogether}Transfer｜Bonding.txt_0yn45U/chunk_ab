but it sounds like
wrapped up like a douche into the runner in the night
blinded. And this is so
Christos in Hillman's
etymological
and phylog...
phylogical? Phylogical?
Traipsings.
So I misheard
what Hillman was
saying with these words
hyma, and
given my absolute fascination,
here's the underlying psychic
and cognitive origins of my
mandagrene. Because in the labyrinthine
understructure of consciousness and particularly linguistic
consciousness, there's a periscuitophrenic
boiling turbulence
that
can lead us toward insight
but also can lead us to
insanity. Or confusion
with fusion, meaning mixing unlike things
like hyma and hymen. And for me there's so much here
because
Hillman is talking of the power
of virginal youths
in the ancient world and particularly
Greece and various
countries in what we now think of as Europe
including Georgia
and the Black Sea area, Italy, Sicily
perhaps
though he rarely mentions it specifically in this way
areas in the Middle East and so forth. And how there's this
incredible confusion
going on between mystery traditions, languages
pharmacon
pharmacological understanding, medicine
all sort of turbulent swirling around. So in my own
mind what's going on is I'm thinking
the women who use the venoms were
the origin of medicine, Medea
Medea, this med which is actually the MD is what
is important here. And notice that we omit the vowel in our own
nomenclature, MD, which we think means medical doctor
but I think Hillman would smirk and say
and you know call him a madman, be my guest. He would smirk and say
nabra, these are the masters of the purple
the oysters
the dipsis, dips, what the snake venom
um
and it's just an accident that medical
doctor uses the two consonants that are the root
that come to us he would claim from
Medea and who was a youth
obviously she became a woman
but there were many, apparently in
ancient times there were many
children like late phase
children and early phase teens
who had magical or divinatory powers
who were possessed, who inherited
medical knowledge because someone
taught Medea, someone
and I don't really know
where she comes from though Hillman makes some
noises about this. So what happened to me is I'm thinking all these things I'm thinking
haema, blood
venoms
making drugs in the human body
with various exudates
secretions of the body, the capacity to
turn the body into a pharmacy
by making cuts on the surface of the skin
and wrapping these in medicated claws containing
venoms and botanicals
and the one thing I haven't heard Hillman
directly say but I think is nonetheless very
likely dusts, soils
these are fundamental to
many ancient cultures ceremonies
and rites, specific dusts
when I was transferred
and in Nisgim
by my friend Ryan Furstiver
he gave me dust, he gave me
the paint and you know when
this is something Hillman's not speaking about
and maybe there's no evidence for this in what he calls the primary sources
but this is crucially important because we're not talking about something
that's 3 or 5,000 years old
we're talking about something that's 10, 15, 30,
50,000 years old, these soils
specific soils in the beaver bundle
in the Blackfoot way of life
there are 7 soils
there's a purple soil, there's a purple soil
okay and he's talking about
Hillman is talking about texts
where
there's purple markings on people's faces around their eyes
and so forth and he's not thinking paint
he's thinking drug, he's thinking stain
like wine stains the lips
probably any reference to purple is being interpreted as
because of the bizarre
and confused inclination of moderns
religions and muslims and so forth
actually I can't speak for Islam particularly
but to reject
any idea having to do with
the word that I usually use is pharmacopoia
which means to make
to make though I don't know the actual roots
so what's happening to me when I hear these words Haima and Haiman
I'm thinking of the
power, the spiritual power of the as yet
unsexualized youths
and as Hillman
you know Hillman says that the Greeks talk at great
length particularly in Galen and perhaps in knownness about secretions
from the bodies of
youths and the mixture of these secretions
with various botanicals and poisons but he overlooks dusts
or there's no mention in the primary sources
and what I'm trying to say is it's blatantly obvious
that the paints were absolutely
crucial in ancient indigenous
cultures and these are soils almost
invariably although the purple paint
is said to come if I recall correctly
is said to come from it might be blue
but I think it's purple I literally do
to come from a specific the feces of a specific
waterfowl which is baked
possibly mixed with other substances
so you know
Hillman loves to regale us with the vocal music
of the purple brah, the purple was in his eyes
he had
he had taken the medicine
and given him the medicine
ocular
administration he at least implies ocular
administration of substances
but you know when transfers occur
which are crucial ceremonial initiations
in Blackfoot there's a few in the Blackfoot culture
and probably in many other indigenous cultures which I know
first hand knowledge of but in the Blackfoot
there are a few things that are important that are obvious
the first is
it can't be secret it has to be it can't be entirely secret
someone has to witness the transfer
has to be an observer witness
and
the second is
the paint
the stain is made in the palm
of the one who will transfer
and then the third is the singing
now there are other things going on which are not obvious
in the superficial level
of description
and
this is very important because
clearly these ceremonies
these initiatory rituals that bring someone into a family
they are filial bondings
they connect a person
to an ancestral lineage
you can imagine like an amphitheater
but particularly where the backside of the amphitheater
is the ancestral beings and the progenitive beings
the progenitors and the other half of the amphitheater is the future
the children the progeny
now this doesn't come from Blackfoot this is my own thought
my experience because
after receiving the transfer
and I poorly you know because I'm stupid and naive and somewhat confused
and lazy didn't understand
I mean how can you understand the first time
I won't even talk about what happened to me the first time I engaged in actual sex
I'll leave that right out
because of my incredible naivety
I didn't immediately
continue with the process
of securing
this gift and this bond
but what happened
were dreams and I will not say
six of the dream because I think those are sacred and should not be spoken of
but I will say that it was very clear
that ancient ancestors were coming to check me out
they wanted to smell my sweat
they wanted to know
who is this are they worthy
and what's interesting about this is
