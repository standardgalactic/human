learning Tai Chi
very similar thing happened
I would have dreams where old Asian men would come in a group
in a pod
and they would tell me straight up we're here we heard about you
you know
it was a transfer learning Tai Chi is very similar
and so the thing that I want to make clear here is this
idea of transfer is very important
and exists regardless of which culture we're looking at
that the Chinese have anything to do with the ancient Greeks
I can't answer the question but
I'm going to guess that
this is what polymaths do
they mean otherwise seemingly distinct
ways of knowing they're integrators
we sew them together
as in the definition
of
hymen joining
who would think this word hymen
is a relationship to transfer
but to join families together
is a kind of sewing in the sense of
SEW rather than SOW although
again this SW thing is really the
important feature
and look think about what you get
and you put the S over it
I know this is going to sound mad like madness
but stay with me
take the capital S and flop it over to either side
flop it backwards flop it forward so that it's lying
on its vertex
and then
put the W behind it
put the W behind it
and what do you have you have a stitch
you have the joining
you have the wound of the W
annealed by the S that curve
you also have this weird
joining
of principles
angles and curves together
dogs and cats mating in the forest
in the thunderstorm but you have the angles
and the curves
now the W and the M are often understood as
evocative of the feminine
the M of the
the wisdom, the night seeing
of the owls
and this word begins words like mother, matron
medea, meduse
medusae as Hillman pronounces it
medusae
and the W
which is of course the M inverted
wow
uh
I wonder if I can remember my alphabetics
here
way
it's travel and also
to traverse
um
but it's mirroring to
in a sense you have the M
goes from the earth up to the sky
transmits energy through those points up to the sky
and the W draws energy down into the
earth
but that's a poor
uh that's a poor dissertation
on W because it's been so long since I've tried to remember
what I was shown
when the teaching intelligences were with me
so what happened to me is
I thought Haiman
joining and Haima blood
these things obviously go together because when the Haiman is broken blood
appears right and
um and then the association
with feminine medicine immediately brings to
mind what we think of as stinging
and I'll bet you you're going to see
a bunch of correlations here
in the ancient Greek
I'll bet you that purple stings
and there's a
sacred mystery in the Blackfoot origin story
of the sun and the moon
and their marriage on earth and the birth of their children
and the moon
becoming seduced by another lover which the sun
detects excuse me that's hilarious detects
de-texts
un-texted which the sun detects the scent of
and
discovers that
Koko Makitsom
which is the Blackfoot word name for the moon
Natotsi I think is the Blackfoot name for
the sun
Koko Makitsom has been seduced
by something described as a many-legged snake that lives in a hollow log
and then the snake idea implies stinging
right the incredible
terrifying strike the hypodermic
instantaneous
resulting from contact with a serpent
when you see
someone or something actually bitten by a viper
or in some cases
a cobra or whatever
the strike is like lightning
okay what's actually happening and people don't realize this is that the animal
is transforming time in three different ways
it's literally
manipulating a temporal manifold
locally so the first thing it's doing
that's obvious is that it
and this is very similar
in Tai Chi or martial arts prior to strike
you draw energy
there's a compression into the striking member
and then that compression is released very suddenly
a good example would be
the concept in martial arts of the one
inch punch
there's no chance to
gain velocity over time space
you shrink time space
and the suddenness with which the strike occurs
absolutely changes time and by the way in case it's not obvious
combat, any kind of combat
is fast time
fucking not
combat changes time
intercourse changes time
intercourse is the establishment of a mutual
it transforms time
it changes the meaning of history in the future just as the strike of the snake does
just as the venom does
the metallic does just as dreaming does
intoxication changes time
it transforms the
not merely how many meaningful events per second are there
we go from like zero or none or very few
to suddenly seven or nine
or fifty
in the bloodstream it changes the meaning of a heartbeat
you see the intoxication enters
the metabolic body of the being changes the meaning of time
the pace
and the meaning of the tempo and the cadence
and then the venom also changes the future because it may
in many cases collapse
the entire lifespan
of a being into a few moments or hours
or you know in very painful situations
days
who was it is it Paul Rosalie
the amazon protector
he speaks of a specific snake
I can't remember what he refers to it as
euphemistically it's like the guardian of the jungle
or something like this the jungles
the jungles war warrior
he implies that this is the spirit of the jungle
and when Lex Fridman asks him
why is this
why is this particular
creature so terrifying
and Rosalie says well
you don't call for like
medical help
you call your mom to say goodbye
you pay attention to what's around you because these are your last few moments of being alive
and notice what he's saying there
he's saying the venom changes time
the transformed temporality
and we moderns think oh no
time is mechanical tick tock tick tock tick tock along the clock
the future changes time
this is what we mean by megahertz and gigahertz and things like this
we're talking about more divisions of a second per second
mechanically
but long before there were mechanical divisions of any kind at all
there were relational divisions
sensorial divisions
cognitive divisions magical divisions
and when a ceremony begins
the fundamental form of time changes
it is temporomagical
it's time magic
I don't even have a word for this
I need some kind of a neologism here
I'm not sharp enough to forge it immediately
