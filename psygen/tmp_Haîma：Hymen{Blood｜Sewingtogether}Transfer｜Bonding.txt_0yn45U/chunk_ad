oh
so what I thought of was hymenoptera
I thought of many legged snake that lives in a hollow log
those are bees or wasps
and why are they a snake
because they sting
suddenly you're being stung
by the way you want to transform time piss off some wasps
you're going to be transforming time in a huge way there
so I thought ah the medicine the venom
and the hymenoptera the matriarchal
insect super organisms
that I've been fascinated by and stung by throughout my life
almost died from the transfer of venom
I received from a yellowjacket
when I was 7, 8 at the ocean
and I think those things can bite or sting
and I wasn't allergic
to the venom it was a septic problem
blood poisoning
because the yellowjackets don't have
they externalize their digestive system so
when they bite something they inject digestive fluids
into it sort of externalizing their stomach
and whatever they've been eating you know rotten fish
dead
shellfish bits of
gelatinous festering crab meat
you know whatever they've been feasting on at the ocean
that gets hypodermically injected into your skin
and in some cases that's not going to go well and in my case it did not go well
my arm turned purple the doctors told my parents
I might die I couldn't eat food
for many many weeks I was in agony
but the thing is when a
and this is something Medea must have known and those who trained her must have known
when a living being in venoms invenomates you
that's a transfer between
those people and your people
if you get bitten by a rattlesnake
and you survive the magic of their people is in you
and with that magic comes knowledge that is a joining
right that is hymen
sewing joining together
if the concepts that Nate
so generously
integrated
are good I have more to learn about this
but mainly I'm here to correct what I said earlier
and to explain why I was confused
and how my confusion hopefully is transforming in the direction of insight
if I'm you know
nemosity and the muses guide me well
in my walk about
yes when you take of a plant substance
you are joined to those beings when you take of an animal substance you are joined
to those beings this ridiculously silly idea
that we have silly for its simplicity
we are what you eat you know that's the redneck version of wisdom
now you actually the ancestors of the beings
you consume or you encounter
and have chemical intercourse
with become
a part of you not a part become
integrated into your being
their intelligences and their memories and their noses
their seeing becomes integrated into you
as the people who think mushrooms are the source of insight
will of of air and yet
how confused they are because the spirit of insight
belongs to no specific substance
and it can be evoked
elicited invoked
summoned it can be
it can be brought forth
with nothing more than language
the music of speaking
yesterday when I met
the brilliant painter
is his name perhaps
let me get it right
let me get this right
I had seen this man painting
and I asked him
because I wanted
to know if he sold his paintings
so overwhelmed by the living light
in his paintings
that I wanted to have one
Joe Barlow
and so he was painting and I very politely
and delicately inquired may I speak with you
and he just turned to me and rather sternly
shook his head and I understood
because the speaking is the end of the trance
of the enchantment but the speaking can also begin
the enchantment and when I ran into him yesterday and spoke with him briefly
while I was making my recording
he commented
on my melodious voice
so these people who think oh you know
psychedelics are the gateway to enlightenment
the gateway to enlightenment is passion
curiosity, wonder, awe, the virtues
why is it
that the children, the youths
who have not yet been
initiated into sexual congress
why are these the oracles
they are the oracles because their
essence is unmixed
as yet unmixed with
the progenerative
anatomy
of the processes that become
the incarnation of souls
and look I'm not
I'm not trying to defame
sexuality here at all
I'm saying that there's a virtue
there are virtues
that emerge from the
suspension of various behaviors
suspend the behavior of eating for a few days
and you will discover exactly what it is I'm talking about
suspend
the behavior
the behaviors associated with
the generation of orgasm
suspend those behaviors, practice chastity
and you will discover that
the energies of our existence
transform when conserved
and they transform in ways that are impossible
to suspect
in the same way that insight obliterates previous conception
and expectation
and thought
speculation and so forth actual insight
it's as if the mind of an angel
suddenly casts a ray of light
into your consciousness
dissolving its previous forms
and reforging them in beauty
and veracity and the forms of truth
that lie far beyond the concept of
fact
the spiritual forms of truth
and the fruits of actual virtue
are profound
yes there's another path where
transgression
leads to madness and ecstasy
it's you know
it's the antipodes
of two points on a hypersphere
a four dimensional sphere
where the fourth dimension
actually it's probably a seven dimensional sphere but the other dimensions are things like relation
the same the ancestors
the progeny in the future who will learn and know and remember
the
violation of structure
on one hand and the
delicate perfect preservation
of not structure not the bones but the marrow
the spirit of the bones on the other hand
and these are matters which we have long
forgotten and I don't know how familiar
Hillman is with them I mean he's definitely
familiar with the
with what we would
think of as the vulgar
side definitely
but is he familiar with the side of virtue
does he understand
does he understand
the power
the power of conservation
of energies
conservation of spirit
what does he know
of the path of virtue
does he revere it as I do
for the past few moments
with
one of the sacred trees and
I heard Hillman
and the guy who runs the
Gnostic Informant podcast
and also
a young man who
they referred to as Ariel
on their podcast about ball
and the Canaanites and so forth I think
yesterday talking about images
of people underneath trees
and particularly of the fact that
Russia trees which are
apparently the trees that the Ark of the Covenant has forged from
