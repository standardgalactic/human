those roots contain the highest
concentration of DMT in any tree
and
um
um
um
um
but again
when we move toward the physical we move toward the vulgar
and the vulgar in the sense of
um
of nuanced richness and depth
and because it
right the difference between the steam
and the water and the ice
um
the steam is reminiscent of spirit
the water of
well it's just complicated
I've gotten myself into metaphoric trouble here
we could imagine
the water is reminiscent of dreaming
and the ice
extremely structured
as reminiscent of
waking
the spiritual
quote unquote can sometimes be just understood
as more dimensions of meaning, awareness, seeing,
relation, memory, more dimensions
but what I wanted to say
is yes of course
you can take a nap
beneath the night
you can go to sleep underneath the devil's trumpet
you can take a
you can take your rest underneath the detour
and
and its dusts, its pollens
will impregnate you like those bandages worn by
the youths who cut their skin
so obviously you can um
um
there are ways
to develop resistances to toxins and venoms
through constant exposure
and titration over time
right so um
I've heard stories that long ago
medicine women
the specific stories I heard were of the mother of
what was being referred to as the mother of vaccines
and
they presented an image of a woman in ancient
India
who would use thorns or needles
to scratch the skin of the patient
and introduce antidotes
and
drugs but also particularly like
um
she could vaccinate people by introducing extremely small
amounts of the
infective agent
through the skin scratches so that they
the patients would produce antibodies essentially
or antigens
and what Hillman is clearly
speaking of having read about
in what he calls primary sources which I believe to be primary sources
just to be clear um
is a practice whereby
the skin
and there's different things you can do
so
you can introduce intoxicants through
these scratches by wrapping them in a medicated bandage
impregnated with substances
we will um leave aside for the moment with the origins
those various substances may be
um and you can also
uh
introduce antidotes
this way um or
intoxicants right so you can introduce drugs
possibly uh vaccines or
um poisons and you can imagine that there was an elaborate
culture
of killing by poison right and I'm not going to
you know I'm not going to try to say like look there's an explicit division between the genders
here but the men mostly killed with weapons
combat which changes time the women
were masters of intoxicants and poisoning
which changes time and you can imagine that if
you are for example
a harlot or a prostitute
male or female
you may have become immune
to certain venoms by the temporal
and physical titration of these venoms over time
introducing them into your bloodstream and your body
so that you are no longer subject to their toxic
effects you can then eat or drink with someone whom
you wish to kill and they
will die and you will not because the dose
that kills them is less than what will kill you
and this is a delicate and dangerous art
that's very clearly still practiced
you know today in relatively exotic
uh locales and
persons right who have there must be traditional
lines along which this knowledge has been
preserved and handed down complex
texts forbidden texts
pharma capoea
the arts of poisoning
the arts of intoxication, the arts of curing
the arts of resurrection
and so you see this concept
of joining, sewing together
is all through these topics
but what I wanted to say about the trees is yes
you can sleep beneath the detour
when it's fragrance is
thick in the atmosphere
and wow is that fragrance thick and you can
sleep beneath it when it's dropping pollen and many trees drop pollen
again we come back to dusts
and it's very strongly that there were pollens
that were also used curatively
toxically and in
pursuit of
euphoria
there were pollens, dusts and soils
so you can sleep beneath the tree
there are so many things you can do with a tree
that don't require the physical
ingestion or
introducing chemistry to your metabolism
you can have the spiritual
transfer, you can have the spiritual
communion, the spiritual inception
relation and amnesis
with nothing more than your passion
your curiosity, your wonder, your soul, your embodied soul
and any of the forms in nature
the raccoon, the mouse, the snake, the tree, the living place
the mountain, the sky, the star, the planet
all of these beings are your kin
you are their kin and the recovery
of those intimacies, results in euphoric
transportation into insight
you know I was just with a tree that I'm very close with
and I gotta tell you there's no
there's no intoxicant required
to
experience communion
with the great world forest
the history, the family of the history of all the trees
and the family history of this particular tree
and all of the beings that the trees nurture
and heal, rejuvenate and feed and support
yeah
sacred relationships
and you could say yes
why don't you become sexual with the spirit of the tree
it's a doable thing, I'm not gonna instruct you in the process
it's a doable thing
regardless of your
gender preferences, you can have orgasms with features of nature if that's what you want to do
and I'm not, again I'm not casting
aspersions on that, what I'm trying to say is that all of the effects
that are accessible by relatively
I guess the only word I really have
is vulgar or
all of these effects
all of these states, all of these
transfers of knowledge and initiation
and gnosis and amnesis
are accessible
by very subtle means
and I prefer these subtle means
generally speaking, it's not that I never
play with intoxicants or something, I do, I have
rather that
you want to train your spirit
to become
sophisticated in its capacities
to bond
with
the cognizia
the network of anciently conserved
intelligences prior to and embodied in nature
yeah
to travel in the connective tissue of those relationships
which I call the mimula
and that travel you will find healing
enlightening, provocative and profound
generative of staggering insight
that will knock you off your feet
