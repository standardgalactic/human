you may think intoxicants are trippy, you have no idea what it's like
to have the sudden emergence of insight
in and as what previously you thought was your
mind while you're sober
so these are
the virtues that I
adore and recommend that I remember
that I myself pursue and have experienced
so don't be too quick
to leap toward
let's get fucked up and have
forbidden sex
there's something so much better
well I won't say better but vastly different
and you should taste
the pure water of life
and memory
which are truly your origin
before you become too fascinated with
waters
and the toxins and the venoms
before you think that they have primacy
you should taste the original waters
this is my recommendation and hopefully I have corrected my error
my Monde de Green about Haime and Haimen
but before I go I will mention one other thing
consider the Haimophiliac
consider the person or child
who if they are just scratched in the wrong way
will bleed out right quick
and the beloved child, someone beloved to me
was born with this delicate
condition
the nature of time and how time is changed
by this condition
the brightness, the redness, the fire
consider this matter
for there you will find some insight
that I will leave
here undisclosed
thank you for joining me, I look forward to learning
and seeing and speaking and traveling
together in search of insight
and amnesis, wonder and beauty
again very soon
may your path be blessed
and joyful, rejuvenative and healing
and may you find
not merely that which you most desire
but that which is most beneficial for your path
development and relationships
I look forward to our further adventures
and to learning and remembering
together again very soon
bye bye for now
