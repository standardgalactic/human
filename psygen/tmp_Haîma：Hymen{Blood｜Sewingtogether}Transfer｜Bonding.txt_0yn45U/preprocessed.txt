Hello everybody. Welcome.
It's funny from up high here on
Strawberry Hill in
Golden Gate Park in San Francisco.
I can look down on the surface of the waters
and I can see the fishes
of Ixtheos.
And I need to, I'm basically
I'm going to start this recording by making some corrections
to things I
misheard. I'm verbal
Monde de Green's if you will.
I was listening to
Aman Hillman
DC Aman Hillman
who I was listening to just a moment ago on
Gnostic and Former Podcast.
And there's so many things that
Hillman isn't saying directly
but is rather indirectly
implying. And that indirection is a sign
of nuanced sophistication in my view.
Because when you just out and out declare something
part of our mind naturally recoils
from this explicit conceptual
equivalence.
And note that word equa valence.
Equivalence.
And you know I think of myself
as a little bit of a cunning linguist. A slightly cunning linguist.
And I have some
familiarity with Hebrew which introduces to me the idea
of roots and their
primacy beneath the surface
of the languages that emerge
from the strange
almost pharmacological mixing
of ideas.
Eidolon, Eidolon, Eidol's
images.
I, Mage is.
Now that's the schizophrenic linguism.
The schizophrenic linguism sees that
library begins with lie and thinks it means falsehood
and probably doesn't know what brary means.
And I don't actually have any
background for that.
And a truly intelligent
person who is
suffering from and or enjoying
the schizogenesis of their
consciousness sometimes produced
or enhanced by drugs.
The truly intelligent
broken freeings.
What are these freeings?
They are like perhaps sheaves
or skeins.
They are
Well you know this I think was one of the Greek hypostasis
and I know enough to be dangerous but not enough
to be accurate. Ator, or the belly, the
cardio, or the heart.
The freeings.
What are the rest of them?
Nemosini,
aid me, come to my aid.
My real mother.
Freeings.
The hypostasis are a crucially important
topic introduced to me by Julian
Janes in his
sygenic text.
Right when I say that
somebody starts playing bagpipes
and it's the specific song
that is played
in the Monty Python skit.
Yeah, with the skirted bagpipers.
What are the other hypostasis?
cardio, ator, the freeings.
Well perhaps it will come back to me. Julian Janes' sygenic book
The Origins of Consciousness in the Breakdown
of the bicameral mind. Which title actually suggests
a kind of schizogenic
a multi-threaded
disunification
of consciousness and thought
in the epics of human history.
And in that book he argues
that our distant ancestors, and once again this is brilliant in terms of
theoria, it is good for seeing. We don't have to decide whether it's
factual or not. We can take the insight
we can filter
off the
profound, iridescent
surface of the liquid
and taste it in the eye of the mind
and we will know if it is good for seeing.
One of, you know, Janes has a variety of
theses and brilliantly introduces
some neologisms
to show us how
consciousness works after
bemoaning his attempts to understand it by testing animals
and not finding what he was looking for there
in his early education.
And he certainly got some things about the hemispheres wrong, but neuroscience was
early and he wasn't a neuroscientist. Really he was
a kind of a linguist and a philosopher who was
examining Homer, particularly, and the Greek,
which Hillman likens to an instrument
that liberates you from both
lies and modernity.
He likens it to a sort of linguistic
I was going to use the term hypodermic, but no, he would use this other term
that I will refrain from using,
which means a sexual implement that can be used
to introduce certain elixirs or
dotes, poisons, antidotes
to the human body via orifices.
Uh-huh.
I need to correct something before I get too lost here
and that is that in previous videos
I spoke of
Heima as if it were related
to the word hymen.
And this turns out to be almost certainly
incorrect as my friend
Nate Guimand explains
and he says
which I'm sure he's copying some stuff here, but
OK.
Hymen joining in Heima, heat, blood are technically not related.
Hymen means to join together, hence the goddess of marriage from the proto-New European root
syomen, to sew together, join her.
It is also recorded in Greek as I can't read the Greek word.
Heima
he also shows the Greek word blood
comes from the passive present perfect of Etho,
Esmae, from proto-Halaenaic
Eid
proto-Indo-European
Hyed, burn, or fire. Cognate with Latin
Aestis, Estius,
and Aedis, and Sanskrit
indhe to light set on fire.
I'm sure let's break down the etymology and meaning of hymen
and Heima, to understand technically why they're not related.
Hymen, meaning in origin, hymen refers to a
membrane, specifically the vaginal membrane, or the Greek god of marriage.
The term comes from the Greek word hymen associated with the Greek god of marriage
and weddings. The root of the word is traced back to proto-Indo-European
syomen, meaning to sew together or join her.
I think Hillman would object and say,
we've fallen under the 19th century British
pie trance, right, P-I-E.
Heima means blood in
Greek etymology, the Greek word hyma comes from the passive present
perfect of Etho, meaning to burn or to
be on fire. This is really important. I think
Hillman would tell us amazing things about
this, because whenever he speaks about burning
he's usually talking about
substances found around the orifices
of initiates and or medusae
or medicine women.
Med literally comes from this.
Related concepts, the connection between fire and
blood might be metaphorical relating to the color of blood and the idea of life
force. Okay, so these words
have different roots. They have different meanings.
There's no overlapping concepts between joining, sewing,
and blood, fire, indicating the words developed independently in terms of meaning and usage.
In conclusion, Heima and Heima are not
related because they stem from entirely different P-I-E roots,
have different meanings and evolved in different contexts within the Greek language.
Their similarity in sound is purely coincidental. This does not reflect
any linguistic or etymological connection. Now this is my
friend
Nate, my new friend,
and I don't know, it looks to me like he actually composed that
this long text that he sent me regarding this.
Which I am deeply appreciative of because unlike
an ideologue or an idiot, I want to be corrected
when I get things wrong. I want to see better.
And so in this video
I will announce the mistake that I made, which was
a natural mistake. I spoke briefly
in my video yesterday of such
linguistic mandagrens, which
word usually is a neologism referring to
misheard lyrics.
Most famously
in the song,
as if this weren't sophisticatedly related
to the topics at hand,
but it sounds like
there's a lyric in there
that's really hard to understand
but it sounds like
wrapped up like a douche into the runner in the night
blinded. And this is so
Christos in Hillman's
etymological
and phylog...
phylogical? Phylogical?
Traipsings.
So I misheard
what Hillman was
saying with these words
hyma, and
given my absolute fascination,
here's the underlying psychic
and cognitive origins of my
mandagrene. Because in the labyrinthine
understructure of consciousness and particularly linguistic
consciousness, there's a periscuitophrenic
boiling turbulence
that
can lead us toward insight
but also can lead us to
insanity. Or confusion
with fusion, meaning mixing unlike things
like hyma and hymen. And for me there's so much here
because
Hillman is talking of the power
of virginal youths
in the ancient world and particularly
Greece and various
countries in what we now think of as Europe
including Georgia
and the Black Sea area, Italy, Sicily
perhaps
though he rarely mentions it specifically in this way
areas in the Middle East and so forth. And how there's this
incredible confusion
going on between mystery traditions, languages
pharmacon
pharmacological understanding, medicine
all sort of turbulent swirling around. So in my own
mind what's going on is I'm thinking
the women who use the venoms were
the origin of medicine, Medea
Medea, this med which is actually the MD is what
is important here. And notice that we omit the vowel in our own
nomenclature, MD, which we think means medical doctor
but I think Hillman would smirk and say
and you know call him a madman, be my guest. He would smirk and say
nabra, these are the masters of the purple
the oysters
the dipsis, dips, what the snake venom
um
and it's just an accident that medical
doctor uses the two consonants that are the root
that come to us he would claim from
Medea and who was a youth
obviously she became a woman
but there were many, apparently in
ancient times there were many
children like late phase
children and early phase teens
who had magical or divinatory powers
who were possessed, who inherited
medical knowledge because someone
taught Medea, someone
and I don't really know
where she comes from though Hillman makes some
noises about this. So what happened to me is I'm thinking all these things I'm thinking
haema, blood
venoms
making drugs in the human body
with various exudates
secretions of the body, the capacity to
turn the body into a pharmacy
by making cuts on the surface of the skin
and wrapping these in medicated claws containing
venoms and botanicals
and the one thing I haven't heard Hillman
directly say but I think is nonetheless very
likely dusts, soils
these are fundamental to
many ancient cultures ceremonies
and rites, specific dusts
when I was transferred
and in Nisgim
by my friend Ryan Furstiver
he gave me dust, he gave me
the paint and you know when
this is something Hillman's not speaking about
and maybe there's no evidence for this in what he calls the primary sources
but this is crucially important because we're not talking about something
that's 3 or 5,000 years old
we're talking about something that's 10, 15, 30,
50,000 years old, these soils
specific soils in the beaver bundle
in the Blackfoot way of life
there are 7 soils
there's a purple soil, there's a purple soil
okay and he's talking about
Hillman is talking about texts
where
there's purple markings on people's faces around their eyes
and so forth and he's not thinking paint
he's thinking drug, he's thinking stain
like wine stains the lips
probably any reference to purple is being interpreted as
because of the bizarre
and confused inclination of moderns
religions and muslims and so forth
actually I can't speak for Islam particularly
but to reject
any idea having to do with
the word that I usually use is pharmacopoia
which means to make
to make though I don't know the actual roots
so what's happening to me when I hear these words Haima and Haiman
I'm thinking of the
power, the spiritual power of the as yet
unsexualized youths
and as Hillman
you know Hillman says that the Greeks talk at great
length particularly in Galen and perhaps in knownness about secretions
from the bodies of
youths and the mixture of these secretions
with various botanicals and poisons but he overlooks dusts
or there's no mention in the primary sources
and what I'm trying to say is it's blatantly obvious
that the paints were absolutely
crucial in ancient indigenous
cultures and these are soils almost
invariably although the purple paint
is said to come if I recall correctly
is said to come from it might be blue
but I think it's purple I literally do
to come from a specific the feces of a specific
waterfowl which is baked
possibly mixed with other substances
so you know
Hillman loves to regale us with the vocal music
of the purple brah, the purple was in his eyes
he had
he had taken the medicine
and given him the medicine
ocular
administration he at least implies ocular
administration of substances
but you know when transfers occur
which are crucial ceremonial initiations
in Blackfoot there's a few in the Blackfoot culture
and probably in many other indigenous cultures which I know
first hand knowledge of but in the Blackfoot
there are a few things that are important that are obvious
the first is
it can't be secret it has to be it can't be entirely secret
someone has to witness the transfer
has to be an observer witness
and
the second is
the paint
the stain is made in the palm
of the one who will transfer
and then the third is the singing
now there are other things going on which are not obvious
in the superficial level
of description
and
this is very important because
clearly these ceremonies
these initiatory rituals that bring someone into a family
they are filial bondings
they connect a person
to an ancestral lineage
you can imagine like an amphitheater
but particularly where the backside of the amphitheater
is the ancestral beings and the progenitive beings
the progenitors and the other half of the amphitheater is the future
the children the progeny
now this doesn't come from Blackfoot this is my own thought
my experience because
after receiving the transfer
and I poorly you know because I'm stupid and naive and somewhat confused
and lazy didn't understand
I mean how can you understand the first time
I won't even talk about what happened to me the first time I engaged in actual sex
I'll leave that right out
because of my incredible naivety
I didn't immediately
continue with the process
of securing
this gift and this bond
but what happened
were dreams and I will not say
six of the dream because I think those are sacred and should not be spoken of
but I will say that it was very clear
that ancient ancestors were coming to check me out
they wanted to smell my sweat
they wanted to know
who is this are they worthy
and what's interesting about this is
learning Tai Chi
very similar thing happened
I would have dreams where old Asian men would come in a group
in a pod
and they would tell me straight up we're here we heard about you
you know
it was a transfer learning Tai Chi is very similar
and so the thing that I want to make clear here is this
idea of transfer is very important
and exists regardless of which culture we're looking at
that the Chinese have anything to do with the ancient Greeks
I can't answer the question but
I'm going to guess that
this is what polymaths do
they mean otherwise seemingly distinct
ways of knowing they're integrators
we sew them together
as in the definition
of
hymen joining
who would think this word hymen
is a relationship to transfer
but to join families together
is a kind of sewing in the sense of
SEW rather than SOW although
again this SW thing is really the
important feature
and look think about what you get
and you put the S over it
I know this is going to sound mad like madness
but stay with me
take the capital S and flop it over to either side
flop it backwards flop it forward so that it's lying
on its vertex
and then
put the W behind it
put the W behind it
and what do you have you have a stitch
you have the joining
you have the wound of the W
annealed by the S that curve
you also have this weird
joining
of principles
angles and curves together
dogs and cats mating in the forest
in the thunderstorm but you have the angles
and the curves
now the W and the M are often understood as
evocative of the feminine
the M of the
the wisdom, the night seeing
of the owls
and this word begins words like mother, matron
medea, meduse
medusae as Hillman pronounces it
medusae
and the W
which is of course the M inverted
wow
uh
I wonder if I can remember my alphabetics
here
way
it's travel and also
to traverse
um
but it's mirroring to
in a sense you have the M
goes from the earth up to the sky
transmits energy through those points up to the sky
and the W draws energy down into the
earth
but that's a poor
uh that's a poor dissertation
on W because it's been so long since I've tried to remember
what I was shown
when the teaching intelligences were with me
so what happened to me is
I thought Haiman
joining and Haima blood
these things obviously go together because when the Haiman is broken blood
appears right and
um and then the association
with feminine medicine immediately brings to
mind what we think of as stinging
and I'll bet you you're going to see
a bunch of correlations here
in the ancient Greek
I'll bet you that purple stings
and there's a
sacred mystery in the Blackfoot origin story
of the sun and the moon
and their marriage on earth and the birth of their children
and the moon
becoming seduced by another lover which the sun
detects excuse me that's hilarious detects
de-texts
un-texted which the sun detects the scent of
and
discovers that
Koko Makitsom
which is the Blackfoot word name for the moon
Natotsi I think is the Blackfoot name for
the sun
Koko Makitsom has been seduced
by something described as a many-legged snake that lives in a hollow log
and then the snake idea implies stinging
right the incredible
terrifying strike the hypodermic
instantaneous
resulting from contact with a serpent
when you see
someone or something actually bitten by a viper
or in some cases
a cobra or whatever
the strike is like lightning
okay what's actually happening and people don't realize this is that the animal
is transforming time in three different ways
it's literally
manipulating a temporal manifold
locally so the first thing it's doing
that's obvious is that it
and this is very similar
in Tai Chi or martial arts prior to strike
you draw energy
there's a compression into the striking member
and then that compression is released very suddenly
a good example would be
the concept in martial arts of the one
inch punch
there's no chance to
gain velocity over time space
you shrink time space
and the suddenness with which the strike occurs
absolutely changes time and by the way in case it's not obvious
combat, any kind of combat
is fast time
fucking not
combat changes time
intercourse changes time
intercourse is the establishment of a mutual
it transforms time
it changes the meaning of history in the future just as the strike of the snake does
just as the venom does
the metallic does just as dreaming does
intoxication changes time
it transforms the
not merely how many meaningful events per second are there
we go from like zero or none or very few
to suddenly seven or nine
or fifty
in the bloodstream it changes the meaning of a heartbeat
you see the intoxication enters
the metabolic body of the being changes the meaning of time
the pace
and the meaning of the tempo and the cadence
and then the venom also changes the future because it may
in many cases collapse
the entire lifespan
of a being into a few moments or hours
or you know in very painful situations
days
who was it is it Paul Rosalie
the amazon protector
he speaks of a specific snake
I can't remember what he refers to it as
euphemistically it's like the guardian of the jungle
or something like this the jungles
the jungles war warrior
he implies that this is the spirit of the jungle
and when Lex Fridman asks him
why is this
why is this particular
creature so terrifying
and Rosalie says well
you don't call for like
medical help
you call your mom to say goodbye
you pay attention to what's around you because these are your last few moments of being alive
and notice what he's saying there
he's saying the venom changes time
the transformed temporality
and we moderns think oh no
time is mechanical tick tock tick tock tick tock along the clock
the future changes time
this is what we mean by megahertz and gigahertz and things like this
we're talking about more divisions of a second per second
mechanically
but long before there were mechanical divisions of any kind at all
there were relational divisions
sensorial divisions
cognitive divisions magical divisions
and when a ceremony begins
the fundamental form of time changes
it is temporomagical
it's time magic
I don't even have a word for this
I need some kind of a neologism here
I'm not sharp enough to forge it immediately
oh
so what I thought of was hymenoptera
I thought of many legged snake that lives in a hollow log
those are bees or wasps
and why are they a snake
because they sting
suddenly you're being stung
by the way you want to transform time piss off some wasps
you're going to be transforming time in a huge way there
so I thought ah the medicine the venom
and the hymenoptera the matriarchal
insect super organisms
that I've been fascinated by and stung by throughout my life
almost died from the transfer of venom
I received from a yellowjacket
when I was 7, 8 at the ocean
and I think those things can bite or sting
and I wasn't allergic
to the venom it was a septic problem
blood poisoning
because the yellowjackets don't have
they externalize their digestive system so
when they bite something they inject digestive fluids
into it sort of externalizing their stomach
and whatever they've been eating you know rotten fish
dead
shellfish bits of
gelatinous festering crab meat
you know whatever they've been feasting on at the ocean
that gets hypodermically injected into your skin
and in some cases that's not going to go well and in my case it did not go well
my arm turned purple the doctors told my parents
I might die I couldn't eat food
for many many weeks I was in agony
but the thing is when a
and this is something Medea must have known and those who trained her must have known
when a living being in venoms invenomates you
that's a transfer between
those people and your people
if you get bitten by a rattlesnake
and you survive the magic of their people is in you
and with that magic comes knowledge that is a joining
right that is hymen
sewing joining together
if the concepts that Nate
so generously
integrated
are good I have more to learn about this
but mainly I'm here to correct what I said earlier
and to explain why I was confused
and how my confusion hopefully is transforming in the direction of insight
if I'm you know
nemosity and the muses guide me well
in my walk about
yes when you take of a plant substance
you are joined to those beings when you take of an animal substance you are joined
to those beings this ridiculously silly idea
that we have silly for its simplicity
we are what you eat you know that's the redneck version of wisdom
now you actually the ancestors of the beings
you consume or you encounter
and have chemical intercourse
with become
a part of you not a part become
integrated into your being
their intelligences and their memories and their noses
their seeing becomes integrated into you
as the people who think mushrooms are the source of insight
will of of air and yet
how confused they are because the spirit of insight
belongs to no specific substance
and it can be evoked
elicited invoked
summoned it can be
it can be brought forth
with nothing more than language
the music of speaking
yesterday when I met
the brilliant painter
is his name perhaps
let me get it right
let me get this right
I had seen this man painting
and I asked him
because I wanted
to know if he sold his paintings
so overwhelmed by the living light
in his paintings
that I wanted to have one
Joe Barlow
and so he was painting and I very politely
and delicately inquired may I speak with you
and he just turned to me and rather sternly
shook his head and I understood
because the speaking is the end of the trance
of the enchantment but the speaking can also begin
the enchantment and when I ran into him yesterday and spoke with him briefly
while I was making my recording
he commented
on my melodious voice
so these people who think oh you know
psychedelics are the gateway to enlightenment
the gateway to enlightenment is passion
curiosity, wonder, awe, the virtues
why is it
that the children, the youths
who have not yet been
initiated into sexual congress
why are these the oracles
they are the oracles because their
essence is unmixed
as yet unmixed with
the progenerative
anatomy
of the processes that become
the incarnation of souls
and look I'm not
I'm not trying to defame
sexuality here at all
I'm saying that there's a virtue
there are virtues
that emerge from the
suspension of various behaviors
suspend the behavior of eating for a few days
and you will discover exactly what it is I'm talking about
suspend
the behavior
the behaviors associated with
the generation of orgasm
suspend those behaviors, practice chastity
and you will discover that
the energies of our existence
transform when conserved
and they transform in ways that are impossible
to suspect
in the same way that insight obliterates previous conception
and expectation
and thought
speculation and so forth actual insight
it's as if the mind of an angel
suddenly casts a ray of light
into your consciousness
dissolving its previous forms
and reforging them in beauty
and veracity and the forms of truth
that lie far beyond the concept of
fact
the spiritual forms of truth
and the fruits of actual virtue
are profound
yes there's another path where
transgression
leads to madness and ecstasy
it's you know
it's the antipodes
of two points on a hypersphere
a four dimensional sphere
where the fourth dimension
actually it's probably a seven dimensional sphere but the other dimensions are things like relation
the same the ancestors
the progeny in the future who will learn and know and remember
the
violation of structure
on one hand and the
delicate perfect preservation
of not structure not the bones but the marrow
the spirit of the bones on the other hand
and these are matters which we have long
forgotten and I don't know how familiar
Hillman is with them I mean he's definitely
familiar with the
with what we would
think of as the vulgar
side definitely
but is he familiar with the side of virtue
does he understand
does he understand
the power
the power of conservation
of energies
conservation of spirit
what does he know
of the path of virtue
does he revere it as I do
for the past few moments
with
one of the sacred trees and
I heard Hillman
and the guy who runs the
Gnostic Informant podcast
and also
a young man who
they referred to as Ariel
on their podcast about ball
and the Canaanites and so forth I think
yesterday talking about images
of people underneath trees
and particularly of the fact that
Russia trees which are
apparently the trees that the Ark of the Covenant has forged from
those roots contain the highest
concentration of DMT in any tree
and
um
um
um
um
but again
when we move toward the physical we move toward the vulgar
and the vulgar in the sense of
um
of nuanced richness and depth
and because it
right the difference between the steam
and the water and the ice
um
the steam is reminiscent of spirit
the water of
well it's just complicated
I've gotten myself into metaphoric trouble here
we could imagine
the water is reminiscent of dreaming
and the ice
extremely structured
as reminiscent of
waking
the spiritual
quote unquote can sometimes be just understood
as more dimensions of meaning, awareness, seeing,
relation, memory, more dimensions
but what I wanted to say
is yes of course
you can take a nap
beneath the night
you can go to sleep underneath the devil's trumpet
you can take a
you can take your rest underneath the detour
and
and its dusts, its pollens
will impregnate you like those bandages worn by
the youths who cut their skin
so obviously you can um
um
there are ways
to develop resistances to toxins and venoms
through constant exposure
and titration over time
right so um
I've heard stories that long ago
medicine women
the specific stories I heard were of the mother of
what was being referred to as the mother of vaccines
and
they presented an image of a woman in ancient
India
who would use thorns or needles
to scratch the skin of the patient
and introduce antidotes
and
drugs but also particularly like
um
she could vaccinate people by introducing extremely small
amounts of the
infective agent
through the skin scratches so that they
the patients would produce antibodies essentially
or antigens
and what Hillman is clearly
speaking of having read about
in what he calls primary sources which I believe to be primary sources
just to be clear um
is a practice whereby
the skin
and there's different things you can do
so
you can introduce intoxicants through
these scratches by wrapping them in a medicated bandage
impregnated with substances
we will um leave aside for the moment with the origins
those various substances may be
um and you can also
uh
introduce antidotes
this way um or
intoxicants right so you can introduce drugs
possibly uh vaccines or
um poisons and you can imagine that there was an elaborate
culture
of killing by poison right and I'm not going to
you know I'm not going to try to say like look there's an explicit division between the genders
here but the men mostly killed with weapons
combat which changes time the women
were masters of intoxicants and poisoning
which changes time and you can imagine that if
you are for example
a harlot or a prostitute
male or female
you may have become immune
to certain venoms by the temporal
and physical titration of these venoms over time
introducing them into your bloodstream and your body
so that you are no longer subject to their toxic
effects you can then eat or drink with someone whom
you wish to kill and they
will die and you will not because the dose
that kills them is less than what will kill you
and this is a delicate and dangerous art
that's very clearly still practiced
you know today in relatively exotic
uh locales and
persons right who have there must be traditional
lines along which this knowledge has been
preserved and handed down complex
texts forbidden texts
pharma capoea
the arts of poisoning
the arts of intoxication, the arts of curing
the arts of resurrection
and so you see this concept
of joining, sewing together
is all through these topics
but what I wanted to say about the trees is yes
you can sleep beneath the detour
when it's fragrance is
thick in the atmosphere
and wow is that fragrance thick and you can
sleep beneath it when it's dropping pollen and many trees drop pollen
again we come back to dusts
and it's very strongly that there were pollens
that were also used curatively
toxically and in
pursuit of
euphoria
there were pollens, dusts and soils
so you can sleep beneath the tree
there are so many things you can do with a tree
that don't require the physical
ingestion or
introducing chemistry to your metabolism
you can have the spiritual
transfer, you can have the spiritual
communion, the spiritual inception
relation and amnesis
with nothing more than your passion
your curiosity, your wonder, your soul, your embodied soul
and any of the forms in nature
the raccoon, the mouse, the snake, the tree, the living place
the mountain, the sky, the star, the planet
all of these beings are your kin
you are their kin and the recovery
of those intimacies, results in euphoric
transportation into insight
you know I was just with a tree that I'm very close with
and I gotta tell you there's no
there's no intoxicant required
to
experience communion
with the great world forest
the history, the family of the history of all the trees
and the family history of this particular tree
and all of the beings that the trees nurture
and heal, rejuvenate and feed and support
yeah
sacred relationships
and you could say yes
why don't you become sexual with the spirit of the tree
it's a doable thing, I'm not gonna instruct you in the process
it's a doable thing
regardless of your
gender preferences, you can have orgasms with features of nature if that's what you want to do
and I'm not, again I'm not casting
aspersions on that, what I'm trying to say is that all of the effects
that are accessible by relatively
I guess the only word I really have
is vulgar or
all of these effects
all of these states, all of these
transfers of knowledge and initiation
and gnosis and amnesis
are accessible
by very subtle means
and I prefer these subtle means
generally speaking, it's not that I never
play with intoxicants or something, I do, I have
rather that
you want to train your spirit
to become
sophisticated in its capacities
to bond
with
the cognizia
the network of anciently conserved
intelligences prior to and embodied in nature
yeah
to travel in the connective tissue of those relationships
which I call the mimula
and that travel you will find healing
enlightening, provocative and profound
generative of staggering insight
that will knock you off your feet
you may think intoxicants are trippy, you have no idea what it's like
to have the sudden emergence of insight
in and as what previously you thought was your
mind while you're sober
so these are
the virtues that I
adore and recommend that I remember
that I myself pursue and have experienced
so don't be too quick
to leap toward
let's get fucked up and have
forbidden sex
there's something so much better
well I won't say better but vastly different
and you should taste
the pure water of life
and memory
which are truly your origin
before you become too fascinated with
waters
and the toxins and the venoms
before you think that they have primacy
you should taste the original waters
this is my recommendation and hopefully I have corrected my error
my Monde de Green about Haime and Haimen
but before I go I will mention one other thing
consider the Haimophiliac
consider the person or child
who if they are just scratched in the wrong way
will bleed out right quick
and the beloved child, someone beloved to me
was born with this delicate
condition
the nature of time and how time is changed
by this condition
the brightness, the redness, the fire
consider this matter
for there you will find some insight
that I will leave
here undisclosed
thank you for joining me, I look forward to learning
and seeing and speaking and traveling
together in search of insight
and amnesis, wonder and beauty
again very soon
may your path be blessed
and joyful, rejuvenative and healing
and may you find
not merely that which you most desire
but that which is most beneficial for your path
development and relationships
I look forward to our further adventures
and to learning and remembering
together again very soon
bye bye for now
