And again, I'm very ignorant on this topic and so I don't really trust my own opinions and I'm happy to be educated by those with other opinions.
But most of the intellectual, intelligent Jewish people among my friend groups, they are not in favor of the slaughter of civilians.
And you know, Israel as a nation is not the same thing as the Jews and Hamas and Hezbollah are not the same thing as the Palestinians.
This is a very complex and problematical category problem here, again, right?
And I've spoken of this in previous videos, I now remember. We shouldn't confuse Israel with Jewish people and Hamas and Hezbollah with Palestinian people.
The fact that many of the participants fit into some, you know, category notwithstanding. We need to think much more carefully about this.
If anyone is standing around waving flags and cheering for the slaughter of, you know, civilians, those people are the problem and I don't really care what their ethnic or political or, you know, nationalistic origin is.
It's fundamentally inhuman and bad.
So for the moment, I'm going to leave that there remembering that I've discussed this in another of my recordings.
So grateful to have had this time together. Thank you for joining me. Please take a moment to support my work in whatever way feels appropriate for you if you're enjoying it.
I wish you beautiful ways, days, relationships and opportunities. Bye-bye for now.
