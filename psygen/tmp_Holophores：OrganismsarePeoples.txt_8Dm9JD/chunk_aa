Hello everybody, welcome to me clearing my throat, out on a wander.
Except I know where I'm at or I think I do.
This is really what I want to talk about, thinking that we know things.
There's many old stories where some kind of trouble was introduced into the world along
with us, we humans, and there's a little male bumblebee here that might need some warmth.
One of his wings has become damaged. I'm going to try to find a sunny place.
It's on my finger now where he can warm up and perhaps get some nectar that may help him.
Now I don't know what's going on with the male, my fingertip, though I know it's a male.
Biologically it's easy to understand the difference because I've learned things about how to
recognize categories. I know words, I know words like male and female, but knowing something
fundamental about gender is very different from knowing the words and the societal connotations,
the human connotations of the words. Now the bumblebee, I was not expecting to encounter him.
I had an agenda in my mind of what I would talk about, where I might wander when I found him,
and I could see that he was in some trouble. He may be dying,
but even if he is dying, and even if I cannot save him, in this moment we are together and I
am biting with him, and I'm risking, I mean he may be stingless, this is something I don't know,
whether the males have stingers or not in the bumblebee family, but he's doing the dance that
implies, whoops, he fell off, but he fell in a way that's alright, and he's in the sunlight,
which is good because before he was in the darkness, and in the darkness it can be very
difficult for him to loosen his metabolism so that it flows again, and he's done exactly what I was
hoping, so I was going to bring him to a flower where he could get some nectar, and when he fell off
my finger we were at some little sage flowers, and now he's getting some nectar, and he even seemed
to be drinking some sweat off my fingers, and now he's getting little bits of moisture off of the
plants, and he's much more active, and the fact that he's drinking nectar gives me hope that he might
return to the air today, and maybe even eventually to his nest, yeah, when I found him he was exhausted,
see this is the thing, and I could see that he was exhausted, and so I put my finger down on the
ground, you know I'm a big creature compared to him, probably, I don't know, 50,000 times his mass
would be like a living mountain reaching down out of the sky, but in his way he understood my
intention, see, and none of this had to do with language, even though we can frame it in language,
it's so good to see him drinking the nectar from the sage plant, which is where I was taking him,
because I know that in the sunlight with the nectar he's got a chance, and he's very active,
he's not flying yet, but when I put my finger down next to him, do you think he knew what I was?
Do you think he thought this is a giant human being? This is a male human being? No, in order to
navigate in the world of the bees and the animals and the plants and the insects, it's not names or
categories that are important, although they play a role, it's something deeper, I think he recognized
that my intent was loving, I care for him, and so he took a big risk, climbing on my finger,
he barely had the energy to cling to my finger, now he's still navigating in the flowers, getting
nectar, it may be that his wing is too damaged for him to fly, it's not clear, he's not making an
attempt to fly yet, but when he was on my finger he was preening, it's a good sign, preening is a
preparation for the attempt to fly again, and you know, it's not clear that I can save his life,
if it is his time to die, he will die, but I can show him care, and I can bide with him in difficulty,
but just a few minutes of my time could be the difference between life and death for him,
and even if it is not the difference between life and death, it's the difference between a world of
forces, and factors, and a world of beings who care for one another, and I definitely care for him,
he's not a stranger to me, even though we've just met, I love his people,
and this is what I was going to talk about, we humans have problems with abstract knowledge,
categories, characteristics, that's a tree, this is an insect, that's a human, this is a living place,
or this is just a park, or this is just a parking lot, or this is just a building,
the just word is really a problem for us, because in a way it cuts off the infinities
that surround each being, and in fact there are two different branches of identity, at least,
if we pair them down to essentials, and this is the whole problem, what's the essential thing
about something we're relating with, well in the left hemisphere's view, so to speak,
it's not purely true, the essential thing is its name and its category, that is a mint plant,
that's a spearmint plant, and then there are some qualities associated with spearmint,
one can make tea or chew the leaves, it's in candy, you know, it's maybe it's a rhizome,
I'm not sure, there's biological classifications, clinical classifications, and these are all
easily grasped and manipulable, and they seem complete, and because they seem complete,
this aspect of our consciousness that I associate with the left hemisphere, right side of the body,
really prefers this mode of things, because there's nothing unknown, and it can go on to
whatever it wanted to categorize, and evaluate, and measure, and account for, next,
but then there's another form of knowing that comes way before all of this, and was largely
evicted by the onset of all of this, and that way of knowing is intimacy, or at least this is one
of the words I use to talk about it, and what passed between me and the bumblebee was intimacy,
I don't know what it is, even though I can name it, but what I see when the bumblebee is
struggling in the shade on the pavement, is an opportunity for reunion, an opportunity to embody
something beyond knowledge, the original light. Now, in this other way of knowing what someone
or something is, barely begins at the category, and extends deep into the impossible beauty of
being embodied alive together in sunlight on a world with atmosphere, a world so safe, so protective,
the creatures here had the time to develop elaborate physical embodiments, the octopus,
the whale, our eyes, our hands, the wings, the scales, the claws, the teeth, all of these things,
our ears, our noses, scent, this is a very precious and rare world, even if there are many worlds
with life, hello, our world is a paradise, at least for the moment it remains a paradise,
and it's very clear to me that the development of organisms is punctuated by extinction events
where nearly everything is killed, all or almost all the complex animals die, and there might be a
few little islands here and there that survive, deep within the earth, underwater, high in the
mountains, it's possible, but most worlds are unstable, and so the opportunity to develop
elaborate physicality and relationality is limited, you have to have incredible luxury
to be able to develop an animal like us, we're almost the, what's that word, we are the dividend
of the incredible, staggering, astonishing stability of earth's biosphere,
so what I wanted to talk about today
is an idea that I've touched on in a number of previous videos and wanderings,
but I want to play with it in a specific way, so I have this
concept that was taught to me by a non-human intelligence, and I assure you it was extremely
astonishing the way it showed me, it wasn't showing me in language, it showed me
by moving my mind to its perspective so that I could share in that perspective directly,
and what it showed me, or what I, let's see how should I put this, my translation of what I was shown
was the development of a concept called holophores, and holophores are root ideas that inflect
our understanding and experience of identity cognitively,
right, what we think things are, and do, and are for, and so on,
and over time our holophores became tokenized, initially they had
diverse dimensionality
so that we would never simply believe the concept, right, much as when we're dreaming
identity has diverse and unusual dimensionality, so too the holophores, the sun, an organism,
mother, dreaming, hand, eye, friend, food, all these things they had
forests of meaningful dimensionality, or dimensions of meaning, right, it was impossible
for them to be abstract for most of human history, but over time in waves as societies developed,
language developed, technologies developed, we lost that dimensionality and the holophores became
flattened, and they flattened in particular directions, right, one of them was that the
humans are supreme in nature, and while that's not untrue it's a crippling idea,
it will destroy our minds and our ability to relate with ourselves and life if we believe
the imprint of the token as it presently exists commonly,
so it turns out that underneath all of our structured knowledge and awareness
there are these tokenized holophores and they're badly damaged, they're like
broken algorithms, right, that every time they start to branch toward meaningful dimensionality
they crash, they crash into their own incomplete structure, and the projection of its completeness
and consciousness, meaning that, you know, if I know that's a tree, that's enough, that's all I
need to know today to determine whether I have to pay attention or not, or how I'll pay attention,
so on, so our holophores are broken, all of them,
and thus our cognition is damaged, right, in this way,
Hi, it's okay,
Hi,
she's asking the children if they know where they're going,
you can see the problem right there, and she's asking are you sure, right,
are you sure that's a tree, are you sure you know,
it's easy to be sure that we know if knowledge has become so flat and tokenized that all we
have to do is determine which category something belongs to, and then we're pretty much done,
we can determine whether we're, you know, how we should interact with it or if we should interact
with it, except that our categories are all dead inside, so mostly we don't have to interact with
anything, except machines, right, and machines are part of the product of this problem,
but I want to return, you know, the catalog of holophores from which everything inherits meaning
and identity or not is broad, there are many, if someone said name seven, I could do that,
I could name seven really important ones, what is the universe, what is the sun,
what is the world, what is birth, what are beings,
what is a companion, what is dreaming,
there are many other important ones, what is seeing, what is knowing,
but I want to just play briefly today with one, what is a being,
well this is the most general category, right, it's the category above organism,
organism is a form of being,
but I just want to talk about our capacity to repair our holophores,
and one of the really important for me experiences of that repair that happened even before my mind
was transformed, and it was this, I began to think of all the diverse forms of life on earth,
first as fully fledged beings, right, every plant, every insect, every animal,
every living place, every microbe, and also it was clear to me that their relationships formed
another dimension of being, right, so that they really are only beings together,
you know you could take all the bees in the world and put them in a box,
and they would die right away, right,
because without the living world the bees aren't bees,
in order to be bees they need all of their companions, and even their threats,
even what we think of as their competitors or enemies,
so first I learned to think of all of the life forms as beings, and then I realized
that they are not beings alone, they are beings together, like the organs of a single body,
all of them, and you need all the organs, there are no bad organs in the body,
and that was a beginning, that made me understand the world as more than a being,
as something we don't actually have a category in language for,
a close but weird category would be angel or god,
but it's possible to think beyond categories,
we can think in ways that we have no category for, so that I can see,
for example, that the world is a biorelational hyper structure,
more than a being, filled with organs that each express unique aspects of its character,
and activity, and also similarly it's a time being,
it's a very astonishing, multi-layered, temporalizing context, it makes time,
it makes forms of time, each form, each possible and actual form of relation is a form of time,
and each of those forms have different characters, and paces, and tempos, and tones,
and rhythms, and meaningfulness, and purposiveness,
so with these movements my idea of what a being is and what an organism is began to change,
and it changed in such a way as to reacquire dimensionality that my culture had disposed of
with clinical ideas and language,
and this is the great danger of our language, and the way that we're involved with language,
it's deeply troubling, it nearly explicitly precludes the possibility of something resembling
intelligence, intelligence requires freedom in the dimensions of being, freedom to see and
participate, to understand, to speak of, to explore, to invent, to go beyond,
so that was one of the first transformations that happened,
and then there was a later transformation
in which I began to think of each of the beings that I encounter in my life,
the plants and animals and insects and living places, the humans,
of course I always thought of the humans this way, we're trained to do that,
but I began to think of each of the animal forms as peoples,
so instead of just thinking about the ants or the wasps, I thought about the ant peoples,
the wasp peoples, the flower peoples, the sage peoples, the rosemary people, the oregano people,
the birch people, the oak people, the raccoon people, the skunk people,
the opossum people, the bear people, the badger people, beaver people, the otter people,
the butterfly people, orchid people,
the whale people, the dolphin people, the octopus people, the crow people, the raven
people, the bat people, the spider people, scorpion people, centipede people, all of
these beings as peoples, and each of the peoples as the present embodiment of an
astonishing lineage of beings and relationships, right? The beings are not
alone, the peoples are never alone. Only get them together, only come on a world
where they're all together, like ours. And this changed everything. This one
shift from thinking about living beings as things, right? You know, people will say,
oh, no, a bee is a creature, but they think of creatures as things. They don't
think of them as peoples. But to me, it's not merely thinking. I'm not just
thinking, oh, these are peoples. I'm feeling them as peoples. So when I walk
through the garden, I'm in a family all together, right? And there's competition,
and there's violence, and there's predation, and there's disease, and the
humans are insane and just go around wiping things out for all kinds of
confused reasons. So it's almost as if the humans who think of themselves as
the people have become the unpeople because of something in their mind.
Something is broken in their minds, and the brokenness has to do with language
and categories. It has to do with formal representational cognition and problems
with that that evolve over time. They develop over time into deadly misapprehensions.
Now, I'm not trying to convince anyone to make the same change in their holophores
that happened to me. And honestly, it was only partly volitional. It wasn't as if I
tried to change the holophore, though. I was intending to try to understand more
deeply, to see more clearly, to know more richly than language ordinarily allows
for. I was trying for that. I still remember the feeling of the male bumblebee's
tongue on my skin. Such a tiny, tiny thing, yet I could feel the wetness of his
tongue as he was absorbing a little bit of moisture from my skin surface, my
sweat. And when you think of this, you will understand something very profound.
When I reached down my finger and he climbed on, that was a moment of great
bravery for him, but also of intimate sensing. He could sense this being is
