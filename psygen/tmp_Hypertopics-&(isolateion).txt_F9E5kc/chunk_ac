that it was not merely an abstract study, it was a study of the relationship
between origin, the origins of minds, minds themselves, certain features of math,
and certain features of geometry. There were mystery schools and so on.
As I've mentioned many times before, in human thought,
in human society, in human history,
for as long as we've been
subject to, affected by, and productive of, language, spoken language,
we necessarily inherit a structural situation.
There must, in linguistics, some of this must be known. There must be no
enculature for this, but as someone who's studied topics that may emerge from semantics
and linguistics and psycholinguistics, it eventually became profoundly obvious to me that
there's a strange and powerful structure that underlies language, and thus must also underlie
religion and science and hypertopics themselves, and what I'm going to speak about next is a
hypertopic, because it gives us a glimpse into foundational principles that underlie
the possibility of conceptual thought, and particularly our lexicons, and in the lexicons,
the lexicon being the library of words and forms of speech,
natural to some given system, for example, modern English.
So there's a structural feature of our lexicons that also has fundamentally to do with categories,
not just the word lists, not just the dictionaries.
And I've spoken of this many times previously, but there's a structure
that resembles the structure of knowledge. The hypertopics are what I would call uniphores,
a couple of examples of uniphores. So
if words are the branches of the tree of a language,
the dictionary would comprise the trunk,
and so the dictionary is hyper to any word. The lexicon is hyper to any
instance of language, and language is hypo to the lexicon.
Similarly, there are conceptual foundations that are not ordinarily acknowledged by common
speakers, and there may be words, there may be words for these that I don't know, and if any of
you know the words for these things that I will describe, please enlighten me. I would very much
like to know, and rather than presuming that I have original knowledge, I'm much more inclined
at this point to think that I may have discovered something previously well known to experts
in grammar and linguistics, but
there are concepts that are primordial, they are root concepts in language and without them,
we would not be able to derive identity conceptually or representationally.
These words I call holophores,
they are words like, they are actually not the words, they are the concepts
pointed at by words like friend, food, mother, mirror, dream,
sky, like all of these, you have to kind of know what the world is, you have to have some sort of
world concept, before
prior to the possibility of making meaningful linguistic constructs, so for example, language is a
holophore, you have to know something about why would anyone make face noises like this
and what the face noises are intended to do and so forth,
so there are the, and you know what is the world, what is a friend, what is food, what is mother,
what is safety, what is threat, what is danger, all these things,
so there are many holophores and in a way, there is no canonical list,
but the most important things about being human are holophores and each language transmits
an often dangerous, at least in English, very dangerous
misunderstanding or mis-presentation of the holophores, older languages such as Arabic and
Hebrew and Sanskrit, Aramaic, perhaps certain African languages or indigenous languages,
they are much, much more intelligent about how they encode holophores
and then there are unophores, right, which are the actual super topics,
the universe, God, these are two common unophores, the word everything, the word everyone,
these point at unophoric elements that are necessary to the structure of conceptual thought.
There must be concepts in linguistic that match these that aren't, these are, these are neologisms
I invented when suddenly the structure of conceptual thought was available to my,
the structure of language and conceptual thought was available to my awareness
and I forged these words to point at features that I was aware of that I could see from outside
language itself
and what we're speaking of here is a hyper topic because it is both within
and beyond conceptual, ordinary conceptual perspective
so what I was concerned about when I began this recording, what I was interested in
was exploring the before of branches on the tree of knowledge
ways of knowing
that
precede the differentiation
it's funny to precede
it made me think of
the first sprout from the seed of a tree
which seems to, if we could watch a time lapse, dig downward
while at the same time pushing
it's opposing
it's opposing feature, skyward toward the light
it's very profound
this thing, the root grows down into darkness, moisture, soil
thereby pressing
the opposing aspect upwards into the atmosphere
and where there is day and night
this figure is a hyper topic
and points at the power of metaphor in language and thought, conceptual thought, to illuminate
that which declarative thought almost never is capable of approaching
declarative language, analytical language
though analytical language can also reveal to us the structure of metaphor
very difficult to make metaphors about the structure of metaphor
we might want a deconstructive, brilliantly analytical
perspective to help us to see
it's really useful to have both, right?
you need the figurative metaphoric intelligence
and you need the deconstructive analytical intelligence
like two wings on a bird
in a sense, for spoken and written language
there is a metatopic that most of us have not been trained in
that is very important to acquire training in if one wishes to communicate profoundly and effectively
even as an author of fictions
and it's the topic of rhetoric
which is the lexicon of what we would think of as figures of speech
which could be understood from a non-linguistic perspective
as the shapes of structure in language
almost like the puzzle shape, the different kinds of puzzle shapes
you can produce and how they fit together
the anatomy of not so much words but sequences, chunks of words
there were times and it may still be true
in history where rhetoric was taught to children
institutionally
but primarily it was taught to the children of the elite
and rarely taught to the children of the poor
unless their parents, having been thus educated, transmitted this knowledge to them
I'm ready to wind up the recording here but before I do I'm going to mention
a book that has become a sort of mimetic success recently
and I'm not yet sure what I think of it
but I find some of the concepts within it enlightening and inspiring
and it's a book called the dawn of everything
one of the authors is David Graeber
other author is also David but I cannot recall his last name
and in the beginning of the book they assert
that much of what we've been told about the human nature
by modern historians and some you know modern being like 500 years something like this
is wrong
and one of the things they said they included a quote from I think it was Benjamin Franklin
that I will paraphrase here
the Indian people when we adopt them into our society
and grant them you know the status of citizens and so forth
presuming that that ever happened
maybe that statement isn't included
but we you know we provisionally grant them some status in our culture
at the first opportunity
where they are allowed to interact with their people
again and particularly should they engage in ceremony
they will not return to our our society
almost invariably none of them
none of them will return
and he mentions that at the same time
people from our society who have been captured by the Indians
and have joined their society
will generally refuse to return to ours no matter what
boons or benefits you know even if there's in a state worth a million dollars
awaiting them back in who knows where Philadelphia
they will not return
and it is claimed that that that the primary reason
which should be obvious
is that our roles and identities in society in civilization civil society are phony
they're fake they're costumes
they're counterfeits of our humanity that we must constantly keep up this appearance of
to our great impoverishment relationally socially developmentally
you know in our society people die inside themselves of loneliness
in open view
of thousands of other people
the the interior poverty of our modern civilizations is exceeded
only by the appearance of external wealth
in a conversation with a friend last night you know I wrote an essay called
the factories of emptiness death in a fictional nation which you can find on my medium page if
you care to peruse it there's some fucking function there's some disease in our society that
which you know is fundamentally extractive in its relation to our interiority
and ends up killing people who are famous right
Jimi Hendrix, Judy Garland, lots and lots of people those two examples doesn't kill everyone
outright and some people survive the exporting of their interiority
into public view that results in fame but many many don't
it's obvious that
what is extractively
propagated in public view influencers and so on
often represents the death or the falsification of our humanity our creativity
our what should actually be influential
that that dies stillborn in the swarming mass of media objects and photographs and
representations of excellence that never there existed in our time anyone who can fake excellence
well enough or produce it within the confines of the market system that builds sports heroes and
fashion heroes and so forth a great big white dog just running into the field
and it's it's almost as if a snowstorm had legs it's really great to watch it or a cloud
it's awesome
I was struck very deeply by this concept
that I'm here elucidating when I was reading their the beginnings of their book the other night
and I will surely have more to say about it but for now I want to thank you all for joining me
please like comment or share this recording or any of my recordings if you find them valuable
strangely I too must compete
in the bizarre market produced by the internet youtube facebook and so on
um if I am to gain the opportunities
to enact the principles that I speak of in my recordings
so in any way that you might feel inclined to to support my work I am very grateful for that support
even if it is merely uh you're listening so thank you for joining me
I look forward to learning together again very soon and I wish you amazing dreams
wonderful relationships and a beautiful way of life bye bye for now
