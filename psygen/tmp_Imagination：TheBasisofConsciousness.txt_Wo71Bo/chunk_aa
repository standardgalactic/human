hello everybody here at the my favorite place to make videos these days and I
just like to remind you all that I don't think my face is all that interesting
and since with my phone you can't really see my hand gestures and one of my
hands is held hostage by the phone
you don't have to watch the videos right unless you really want to see my
facial expressions you can just listen yeah you can just just listen maybe
while you're walking or you know whatever's going on whatever's happening
in your day driving if it's safe to listen while you're driving yeah you
can just you can just listen in so this is kind of cool I don't know if you can
see it because I can't tell when I turn the video I can't tell what it's focused
on let's see here but there's a big raven over by this cedar and it wasn't
too concerned about being approached by a human looks like this cedar lost a
big branch recently I can see a place where something has cracked off from it
oh here's other members of the clan I'm trying to point as best I can at the
at the phenomenon at the beings I'm gonna show you one of our fountains here
because it'll be useful in a moment this is let's see I cannot see well enough
there we go so this is one of our one of the fountains in the garden you can see
there's a there's a central cavity there and I noticed a couple approach the
fountain and start to fill their try to fill their bottles from the the drinking
nozzles which was perfectly natural because they haven't seen anything like
that fountain before but the central cavity is designed to fill bottles right
so it has a button underneath that you put your bottle in there and just push
the button and it'll fill vertically whereas trying to fill your bottle
horizontally is going to be very challenging and difficult and possibly
confusing so I was hoping to use the fountain to rinse my hands off and I
approached them the man had already filled his bottle quite with a great
difficulty from the from the fountain nozzle and the woman was going at hers
and I explained to them I said you know pardon me I just thought I'd let you
know this cavity in the center is for filling bottles immediately the man's
face turned red and he was kind of a tough looking guy but I think he was
hurtful I think they may have been German I often encounter people from
other countries here because San Francisco's a tourist destination the man
the man's face immediately turned bright red and he said oh you must think we're
totally stupid I said no I I didn't I just presumed that you hadn't seen an
arrangement like this before and being unfamiliar with it you wouldn't
understand that the central cavity is for bottle filling I didn't seem to
relieve his concerns much I'm using the santic dope the santic to introduce my
topic today which is imagination you see when I approached the man well when I
approached the couple they were engaged in a private activity between them and
so they were experiencing you know a private moment right they weren't very
concerned about being observed but once I showed up they're they're sort of
social aspect awakened and now they knew they were they were not only were
being observed but had been being observed I just walked through some gnats
that are attracted to the tone of my voice so when I walk through these
little swarms they often land all over my face or my head they like the the
resonance or so I imagine now the man imagined he tried to simulate what I
might be thinking and he was concerned that you know oh we must look very
stupid to you but I'm not motivated in that kind of situation to evaluate
people's intelligence what is dripping down from this tree in order to
understand sorry I didn't mean to give you the view up my nose in order to
understand what is dripping down from this tree I have to imagine things and
hmm some of it actually dripped on my finger but I don't see anything that
could be dripping down from the tree of course what I imagine is essentially
since it's a very warm day I can't imagine water dripping down from the
tree I imagine that there's an organism up there you know
evacuating digestive and fluids and such right but I I didn't succeed in
discovering what the source of the dripping things from the tree were of
course I don't want to spend a great deal of time on it since I'm making a video
see when I hear that sound I imagine
motorcycles because that's the sound that I associate I mean that's that's the
image that I associate with that sound that's a learned response someone who
had never heard engines or motorcycles couldn't possibly have that
imagining so one of the things that we do as human beings primarily because I
think we're profoundly social organisms is we imagine we try to imagine anyway
the how we may be perceived by others this is very complex topic and quite
profound because it motivates and inhibits us from all kinds of learning
and orientation behavior perspectives activities we often may some of us will
do things in hope you know with the hope of receiving the positive attention of
others that means we were imagining a future moment in which the positive
attention of others the reward of that positive attention will be directed
toward us and when engaged in things that we might imagine are frowned upon or
not encouraged in our experience of other human beings and the societies in
which we live we can imagine receiving the the negative attention of for example
our peers or the members of some group to which we may be long which could be a
religious group or a political group we can imagine being punished we can imagine
law enforcement officials taking over the rest of our lives so on so forth so
we imagine future states whether consciously or subconsciously and these
both motivate and inhibit us there are certain things that we might ordinarily
do which we will not do because we recognize that we would receive the
the negative attention of other people or punishment or harm or even just
judgment and it's funny that the guys go to it's totally ordinary but it's funny
that the gentleman with whom I was speaking his go-to concern was oh my god
this guy must think we're completely stupid but that was no part of my
motivation right I was actually simply trying to be like I had a number of
motivations if I look back right post-hoc after the experience when we look
back hindsight is a very astonishing aspect of something we use our
imagination for and by the way the reason that I'm talking about imagination
right now my purpose is that this off maligned whatever it is this word refers
to which is often maligned in in colloquial colloquialism such as it's
just your imagination or you just made that up or you know you're only you're
just imagining things right if you couldn't imagine things you wouldn't
have a mind in fact oh there's one of the pipe find swallow tails that's very
interesting because I have a cocoon at home and that pipe find swallow tail must
have very recently emerged pretty sure it's a pipe find not positive though in
any case if you couldn't imagine things you wouldn't be able to understand
anything and your intellect would not work whatever whatever these words
refer to is this very it's both fuzzy right in that so Fregge a philosopher who
I guess maybe was in the late 1800s I might have that wrong he wrote this this
essay its title has been translated in various ways the title that I have in my
book on the philosophy of language is on sense and nominatum n-o-m-i-n-a-t-u-m on
sense and nominatum and when I say the tree right I'm using a token or a sign
to refer to something that hopefully can be experienced by others nearby for
example that so the tree is can be understood to be the nominatum of the
sign or token I am using in an act of reference in language so the token
points at some phenomenon or situation or circumstance or quality or
characteristic or activity in verbs point it processes nouns pointed things
and languages both useful and very dangerous because it confuses the hell
out of us we confuse the terms with with the things to which they refer we
confuse the terms with completeness we think when I say the tree I've completed
I know everything about once I can name it I know all there is to know about it
right like oh the bird the bird you know in the child's mind and the mother goes
it's just a sparrow and the next time the child sees the thing he's like oh the
sparrow right but it takes away a sense of wonder and mystery and
imagination naming can very often demagicalize our experience so that
believing that we now have a grasp upon it our imagination no longer relates
with it in a way that is nourishing and profound and effusive and evocative
perhaps I might even use the term romantic and some of us will say well
that's in advance right we don't want to just go around imagining things yeah but
that's not there's a there's a useful concern expressed in such language but
there's a blue jay right next to my head there's a useful concern expressed in
such language but it's entirely misguided in that again it's framing
imagination that with which it actually forms its concern as something we would
like to put reins on right we'd like to put a a muzzle on that thing we'd like
to avoid giving it too much liberty and certainly the faculties that that
imagination brings to consciousness of course I'm gonna have to back up the
faculties contain dangers though so I'm gonna back up because we have these
words like consciousness awareness imagination these refer to very they are
not like the word tree right in that the word tree refers to something
external to me that I can lay hands on yeah I can validate that the tree exists
as a physical structure and I can use both conceptual thought and language to
distinguish a specific tree from the trees or the land or the living beings
or the objects categories are very important in language in ways that I'm
not I'm not going to attempt to elucidate today because it would lead me on a
birdwalk but the nature of our categories and our relationships with them in our
minds with our minds determines many features of what it is possible for us
to have experience of so when we change the meaning scope or lexicon of
fundamental categories we are transforming what is available to our
perception imagination experience relation and so on so these words like
consciousness imagination awareness cognition by the way I was tapping
fingers while I was doing this they're very important in that they're most of
you know they represent a good portion of what we have to refer to mental
activity though we have other we have adjectives like wonder and awe and
reverence and disgust and hatred and love and things like this that refer to
feelings but feelings are an aspect of conscious experience except possibly
accepting what happens to us in dreams well at least one of my friends is
unwilling to call what happens in dreams experience because he wants to do
that he wants to segregate that into that which is experienced while awake but
these words refer to things we can't lay hands on their names for aspects or even
for the the whole of our mental experience so consciousness can be
understood to refer to all of our experience though there are some people
who would say things like well no that refers to experience of which we are
aware right that with that upon which we can consciously reflect there's
different ways to use these words and people with different purposes will use
them differently but what I want to point out is that they're quite vague
they're fuzzy it's not clear exactly what it is they refer to the
nominatum of these words is malleable yeah it may you know in some conversations
it will include some aspects of mental experience or activity in other
conversations others in some it will just be very vague and a kind of casual
term like the term mind what do we mean by this but what I want to point out is
that all of the faculties that shape our awareness oh wow what is going on here
so I doubt the camera will capture this phenomenon but it's essentially raining
under this tree and I can't tell what is producing that so because of the light
and the angle of the light I'm able to see what looks like very small droplets
though they could as easily be dust as liquid raining down from the tree
and I don't know
there's a there's an amazingly I'm gonna presume it's probably dust but once
again in order to do so I have to imagine things so our often maligned faculty
that we call imagination has a lot to do with how we first of all in order to
understand something in order to understand the words I'm speaking or to
form your own you have to use your imagination there's pretty much nothing
that we do with our minds intentionally and even unintentionally consciousness is
sort of the it can be thought of as the produce of the engaging of our
imagination with memory and phenomena around us or within us I may feel pain
suddenly in for example my ankle I will refer to my memory and think back and
try to determine if I can recall injuring my ankle if I can't I may try to
imagine what what could be causing the pain so when we look at something and
we retrieve the token that refers to it the tree the bird the wind the stuff
falling down from the tree we use our imagination in an attempt to well we
can use it for all kinds of different things including
things we might not be commonly familiar with so last night I watched a video
about an animal communicator who visited a black panther actual cat at a
preserve and the panther was very disturbed angry at people and it's
certainly reasonable for people to be skeptical about animal communicators and
some of them are probably phony determining whether or not they are
doing what they say or whether they're making things up in other words lying
requires our imagination and inclinations like purposes and feelings and
intuitions and also habits of thought what we're willing to entertain you know
as an idea and that entertaining requires imagination but in watching this
video there was a lot of the male of the couple that runs the preserve was
extremely skeptical in the beginning you could hear him he was trying to say in
his mind there is a 0% chance that you can use your mind to communicate
directly with animals I've been around animals my entire life there's no you
know extra sensory perception going on I don't believe they have an interiority
like ours you know he was implying all these things and he was extremely
skeptical the animal communicator was well known and obviously pretty
skillful and I know I've known a couple myself and I have some degree of this
ability myself or at least I imagine that I do and believe that enough to you
know just say it so most of the stuff she had to say in talking to the cat who
normally wouldn't let any human near his enclosure but calmed down immediately
when she showed up apparently most of what she had to say was stuff anyone
