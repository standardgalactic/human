could kind of make up right oh he's unhappy he's mistreated he's in a very
small cage he doesn't want anything to do with humans he believes that people
have expectations of what kind of behavior he's gonna do so on so forth
he's a regal noble animal an embodiment of kind of celestial wisdom so on and
so forth the kinds of things materialists would really frown on but
that also the kinds of things that people who have wild metaphysical ideas
would celebrate you know there's both sort of both sides of the spectrum right
there's the the probably wildly over enthusiastic and confused people who have
a metaphysical model and there's the people who have absolutely zero ability
to think of or relate with anything other than the raw physical situation and
what they can observe and think about pragmatically somewhere in the middle
or above the middle is what's usually going on and that somewhere is
accessible to us but we have to be both imaginative and sober in my view to get
access to dependable opportunities and understandings and perspectives that
are both pragmatic and open-ended so that they don't cut us off from the often
astonishing abilities of our human imaginations so anyway in the exchange
the woman eventually said the the animal doesn't like its name doesn't like
what you're calling it they they called the animal Diablo and the video is called
how Diablo became spirit which is really about how the name of the name the
humans were using to refer to this animal was changed but the animal
communicator mentioned that the black panther was very concerned about a pair
of kittens that were with it before it was removed from the place where it had
lived and that tiny piece of information was what convinced I mean there were a
lot of features of things that happened that convinced the man that actual
communication was going on but that was the clincher because apparently again
according to the story and we don't have the evidence in front of us we can't
examine you know the history of this cat where it lived before whether or not
there were kittens if there were two what actually happened to them if the
whole thing wasn't just kind of made up we can't really know that from watching
the video right we may have a feeling about the veracity of the people involved
and and what they're portraying but videos are made to entertain and amaze
and engage us so there's a danger that we're being misled right and the
pragmatist will notice this danger immediately because it has a shape-based
likeness with with their concerns and also their their orientation they want
to see through the stuff that would mislead us and that's a reasonable goal
I appreciate the the usefulness of a goal like that but the pragmatist or the
materialist may be disinclined to entertain the idea that minds can touch
each other and share information non-verbally simply through the faculty
that we refer to as the imagination and that's the faculty with which if it is
possible that minds can touch each other at a distance non-verbally in dreaming
in visionary states and learn from each other and transmit and receive
information the imagination is the faculty with which this occurs in which
this occurs but again it's the faculty with which the critic it's the same
faculty with which the critic will deny that this is possible or anything like
their experience or so on and so forth it's the faculty with which the critic
forms criticisms but it's also the faculty with which human minds achieve
seemingly impossible tasks in in science for example like the theories of
relativity Weinstein or the incompleteness theorems of Goetl his best
friend or the layered infinities of canter a man who believed that if we
could understand the nature of infinity it would reconnect us with the divine
intelligence from which our own mind spring a good will encounter are known
to have been in insane which means that their imaginations were not merely
astonishingly adept faculties with which they could ascertain and prove the
nature of mathematical and physical truths they were also dangerously oh
yeah here's more of the little tiny gnats that respond to the music of my
voice they were dangerously they were dangerously intelligent right they were
so intelligent that their minds were capable of imagining things that were
both unlikely or potentially could not be true or simply were not true
Goetl apparently imagined that people were trying to poison him would have his
wife taste all of his food he died of in a nation in a sanitarium I believe I
don't know what became of canter or what his particular delusions may have been
but I will not dismiss his assertion that there's a relationship between
understanding infinities and the origin of consciousness I myself have had some
experience of unusual visionary states in which how shall I put this
in which numbers and orders in numerism acquired non-ordinary connotations in a
way that led me to discover demonstrable features of numerism that were
previously invisible at least to me so these men and many women who I cannot
hear name maybe Emmy norther if I remember correctly the mathematicians
who gave us the incredible discoveries upon which our modern technology depend
these people had astonishing imaginations and very unusual ways of
relating with their imagination very sophisticated systematic ways that led
them to see patterns in information in nature in relationships that led them
to formalize those patterns and led to astonishing discoveries
imagination making things up visualizing things is a crucial underlying feature of
the nature of minds and in our hurry to dismiss certain kinds of nonsense what
we might refer to as delusions humans may become a little too excited and
throughout the universe with the bathwater when we hear stories it is our
imagination that weaves them into something we can feel and relate with
and understand and follow the thread of that requires imagination so today I'm
I'm here to sing the praises of this faculty this often maligned faculty of
our human experience while acknowledging the dangers our minds are such that
under certain kinds of stress or intoxication disease certain genetic
predispositions our imagination can produce delusions and it's not that
there are only two sides to this phenomenon delusion or prodigy right
prodigy can partake of delusion and delusion often masquerades as prodigy
it wants to be seen as a peculiar form of insight the form often a form relative
to what we would think of as the theories or discoveries of an incredibly
skillful detective delusions often masquerade as insight and in the mind of
the one deluded they take on this this appearance and this array of qualities
many of us have known people profoundly what is the right word
profoundly aroused or disturbed by the overwhelming feelings and urgent purposes
that accompany delusion some of us have experienced that directly most of us who
have many of us who have will want to insist that even once the delusion
passed if it did we were aware within its grip of a fundamental quality of in
of seeming insight that was associated with the delusion and people who have
experienced delusions will point out for example that many astonishing
scientific discoveries were initially dismissed right as delusional who would
have believed if it hadn't been proven that the energy held within physical
matter is quantitatively equivalent in some particular aspect of measurement
joules or whatever to the mass of that physical element times the speed of
light squared presuming that light actually has a speed an idea that I find at
once admissible but probably primitive I think we have the wrong idea about what
lights doing when we call what it what it when we call it's apparent velocity a
speed it is with my imagination that I question that yeah but people who have
experienced delusions will say you know well they didn't believe so-and-so you
know they just missed this person's astonishing insight about the nature of
reality to I'm just another one of those brilliant people who's not yet
understood and they may cling very fervently to this position some of
them will cling so fervently is to sacrifice their lives for it it's
unfortunate now of course no one can say for sure that there's no useful
content at all in the delusions of the people who are suffering from madness
because it's impossible to completely dismiss their ideas and perspectives and
theories and often you know if we look at them from the perspective of
psychology we will see that there's a an underlying message about the psyche of
the person in the grip of the delusion in the shape of the delusion in a way
not entirely dissimilar to how the plot description of a dream can in some cases
provide insight into the psyche of the dreamer and then again in some delusions
there may actually be a kernel of fundamental insight that if we could
only translate the figures the structure of the delusion intelligently for
which we would need our imagination we could derive some astonishing prodigious
discovery from the delusion and yet for most of us when someone comes to us in a
state of delusion we're gonna recognize and be very concerned humans are
concerned about the contagiousness of insanity as we can see by looking at our
modern cultures various common forms of insanity are incredibly contagious
thanks in part to the imagination but that's not the only thing going on I
think if I wanted to highlight one specific thing about our imagination or
what we are referring to with this word it would be that the imagination is the
source of faculties abilities opportunities that are prodigiously
diverse and profound and many of these opportunities and faculties will never
be experienced by the majority of us in our lifetimes because we've been told
stories and we've been given descriptions of what's possible and
impossible what's viable and not viable what's true what's false what's
nonsensical it's very it's very ironic that the disciplines whose discoveries
depend fundamentally on imagination disciplines like science pragmatism
critical thinking these very disciplines often submit an unjustifiable critique
of the faculty they all depend on the imagination and when the woman in the
video was communicating with the animal she was using her imagination to do so
literally she was transmitting intentionally transmitting images to
the animal and receiving images which she could then translate into things
that humans could understand in language this is a pre-verbal these faculties are
pre-verbal they do not depend on language language can directly interfere in
them because language and the use of language like I'm doing now I'm speaking
restructures consciousness the reception of language restructures
consciousness and when we're in a primarily verbal state our consciousness
is being restructured in that specific way and the the state that produces
receives processes and transmits images which is the precursor to the
technology that we call television that faculty has been lost to nearly all of
us yet I claim that it is entirely natural and available to nearly all
human beings that is that we can communicate non-verbally using our
imaginations coupled with emotions that might be understood to be the
if images are the content emotions can be understood as the
the energy that bridges the gap between presuming there is a gap we may have
that wrong between minds or crosses the separation we imagine to exist there we
don't really know there's something we don't really know about minds which is
whether they are the product of a unified field effect right if our
individual minds are like the leaves on a single tree fundamentally unified by an
order of existence that's not usually apparent to us or whether they are
distinct and we form connections which is the common narrative right that's
the that's the formal narrative that that minds are distinct and we form
connections and primarily the only way we can form those connections is either by
speaking or being in proximity to one another with you know the exception of
telecommunication so on so forth I strongly suspect the former model is
the correct one that minds are the local expression of participation in a form of
unity that the analogy of leaves on a tree isn't bad but you could use something
else like fish in the ocean where there's an apparent distinction between
each fish and yet the body of water that is the ocean unifies all of them and
they all emerge from it in it and live in it and so on dying it so on and so
forth but my fundamental goal again today is just to highlight that it is our
imagination with which we can recover explore and experience the the faculties
and opportunities of forms of awareness that would to us appear miraculous in
fact they are ordinary but because we have been so long separated from them
because we have so little experience of them and and most of our narratives
either misframe them with wild metaphysical or religious ideas or
inhibit or eliminate them with critiques and statistics though there are a few
researchers who have been using statistics in an attempt to demonstrate the
existence of not what we would call non-ordinary faculties of mind all of
these depend on the imagination the same way the ordinary faculties do the
question is can we step beyond the critical stories and the nonsensically
effusive stories to actually explore and recover the faculties that are native
to our human experience of consciousness of awareness of being of
heartfulness of wonder of poignant desire to step beyond the dry and
uninhabitable models of the societies and cultures in which we modernly
participate we can and one thing that helps us to do that is when we feel
encouraged reassured and inspired to explore without regard to who's watching
who's going to criticize even who's encouraging we can certainly find media
that encourages us to step beyond the relatively limited models of consciousness
ability awareness and our our faculties we can find material that encourages us
to step beyond that that we shouldn't trust because it's it's it's designed to
place us in a trance like state where our suggestibility will produce results
that are not actually realistic or dependable so on the one side that's a
realistic concern on the other side we don't want such critical pragmatism
that we have no chance to discover the many forms of wings that I believe our
human imagination gives us access to or is natural right the many forms of wings
that are natural to our imagination and to our visionary capacities as human
beings particularly when motivated by a deep and trustworthy inner passion for
his passion that helps the imagination across barriers and boundaries that might
otherwise seem impassable
in order to even make the video that I'm making I have to imagine viewers to
speak the words I'm speaking I have to imagine listeners so you can see just
how profound the our actual relationship with imagination is if we look
