carefully at all those features of our human thought experience behavior
feelings inclinations reprehents apprehensions reprehensions and so on
all of these things our fears our desires our victories and our failures
they are all motivated and evaluated in imagination so maybe we can stop
thinking about this astonishing array of faculties potential and actual in such
a primitive way and begin to embrace the vast spectrum of possibility that this
wonderful gift of our human incarnation brings to each of our lives in ways as
unique as they are diverse
