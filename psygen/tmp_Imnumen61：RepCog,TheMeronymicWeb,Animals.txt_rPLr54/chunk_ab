not entirely untrue, but since they're floating in a bath and intimately
relating with what we might as well imagine as an alien life form, billions
of years old, it's not exactly the way we thought. Most of the ideas that we
have, ideas about what the sun is, what light is, what time is, what it means to
have eyes or minds or hands are similarly, they've been similarly denuded of many
dimensions of obvious factual meaning and identity and qualities that we need to
retrieve if we're to have the hope of becoming intelligent together. No one's
going to help us with this, so the task falls to us. We have to become the
pioneers ourselves, do the work ourselves, learn and teach and discover
and correct and explore in the most sober manner possible together. Hopefully
we've had a moment of that here today and I want to thank you for spending your
time and having the interest to wander through the forests of the origins of
the strange faculty of formal representational cognition and the great
mystery of why there's only one animal like that that we've discovered so far
and what the true implications of that might be and could become if we were
able to actually take advantage of it rather than being mostly subject to its
dangers and their rather terrifying outcomes.
