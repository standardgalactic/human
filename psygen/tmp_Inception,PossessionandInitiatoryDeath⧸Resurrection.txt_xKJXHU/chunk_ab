you and those to whom, or the one to whom you, with whom you are in communion, you enter
into communion together. And you know, of course there's a, there's a vulgar, you know,
our modernity is so vulgar in this sense. And there are those who celebrate this vulgarity
in the sense that it violates the kind of dead, concrete structure of tradition, expectation,
organized religion and so forth. Okay, okay, I get it. You know, shoot them with a bullet,
it's not what I mean. But this is what I mean by the vulgarity and its, its explicitly, its
explicit violation of expectation and tradition and perhaps falsely sacred lines of culture,
thought and exposition, action, rulemaking, punishment, inquisition. Surely the idea of
inquisition is practiced by some Christians and perhaps others is a horrifying caricature of
the possibility of questing to seek with noble heart and a self-unclothing, right, a star of
intention that dissolves its armor as it proceeds within us as our hearts, as our spirits, as our
incarnate bodies. So much of our modernity is very vulgar. So unlike the dragonfly that has
lit upon this branch before me, whose eyes are worlds, whose ancestors are myriad,
who is in fact a doorway, a forest of portals, alive and beckoning
to those who understand and remember, to those who recognize,
to those who can sing the pay-ins,
and to sing such pay-ins,
I must be dispossessed of my personal identity and this is the possibility of real humility
from which an authentic salutation may emerge.
Sometimes in the Tibetan Buddhist scriptures we hear something and it would be wonderful to hear
it in the original language, but we hear something like that is translated in English into the phrase
Oh Noble One and almost always when we hear this phrase it is a call to transcendental
anemesis. Oh Noble One and as I say this
I was gazing into the eyes of the dragonfly a couple of inches from my face
though my vision gets old now it's blurry. I used to be able to see with pristine clarity
at every distance but now close up things blur to see clearly I must retreat from them
and we think of this as a physical problem a mechanical problem and it is and yet
the metaphor of it is also quite profound I think yeah
you know
the vocalizations of the birds are living an amnoesis
they are not expressing abstract things they are not words
I don't believe they are representational though I believe it's conceivable that the birds have
similar assets I just don't think they express them vocally
though I could well be wrong about this there is much to learn about the
the language of the birds and their musics
a living mystery
alive to our perception largely invisible to our cognition
resembling in this sense our own dreams
you know I'm willing now to depart
the arcs of the first topic but hold them in your thought and concern
if you will as I proceed
because by elucidating them it is my way of paying homage to the ancestral beings
the progenitors of our being in the sky and on the earth and beyond the sky
and our own progeny our our future children many of whom you know we imagine as humans that
your children are the children you give birth to no we um
um
we parent one another when we adore one another we become uh it's funny
I don't want to use the legal language but in loco parentis
we uh adopt each other in life through relation and care and concern and love
we adopt one another and so too
we adopt each other's families and are adopted by them to varying degrees
depending on our capacities for relational intimacy deeper
than the specific human with whom we may be engaged in the moment right the meta
I met a morph his eyes shining
a poecism from an old friend
whose intelligence was so profound and I'm sure still is
there are many opposites of consent
there's the obvious sort of direct violation of consent
that we understand to be rape whether it's physical emotional relational
financial circumstantial situational
an egregious violation of any kind comprises a form of rape
and one of the members of the extinction adi with whom I was in conversation
and the other day was expositing on
the rape imposed on us through the concept of
equality of commodities and how Aristotle I believe I believe I'm I'm depending on my
rather frail memory here in his nicomachean ethics and I'm probably mispronouncing max
I I've only heard it pronounced once or twice I'm spoke of how this uh imposition of equality
among things that cannot be equal is the origin of every problem even more significant than the
problem of money which is certainly um catastrophically primordial in the history and emergence of
wrongdoing among humans injustice agony rape just as that horrifying noise violates my sanity
and body and mind the unjustifiable
derivation of our being and lives into
dollars and cents and numbers in banks
what won't the humans do there is no answer that list is blank what won't they do on moss
once the necessity of money is introduced which collapses all values to one representation
all histories all futures all ancestors all children all progenitors
but I'm getting again I've
I've departed the path of my intention so there are so many fascinating implications
of some of the concepts that Anand Hillman introduces and I've allowed myself to become
a bit enchanted not so much with the man who I know little of but with his orations and concerns
and in this in a sense in in conversations with friends of late I have mimicked his vocal style
in the sense that we might that they might the listener might imagine I am mocking him
but I'm not mocking him I'm attempting to invoke his mind right and well this goes more
toward the topics that I'm going to chase so we have this idea in the west under Christianity
of demonic possession and what we think this means usually is informed by like the film The
Exorcist or whatever it's bad to be possessed by demons because they're evil and they're
eternally hungry and they will murder and rape and destroy and cause war and plagues and all of
these things right they are the essentially the the matrix or womb in which evil is conceived
and from which it emerges into our human experience in the world and this is at best confused
and at worst completely wrong and we should be very very careful when we come under the
enchanting sway of a concept that is almost completely wrong or very close to being completely
wrong it's probably true that there are no things which are explicitly untrue that can be conceived
right in the sense that conception itself is a mode of truth right the conceivable
is truly conceived the speakable is truly spoken in the sense of of being it is there right I have
spoken these words they are spoken it's true that I've spoken them and it's a similar kind of truth
in conception but there are inconceivable things which are also true and perhaps there are inconceivable
things which are not true but we should not be too concerned about truth and falsity rather we
should be concerned with seeing the nobility of our of our spirit and relations and by nobility I
don't mean the wealth I mean the relational integrity I mean the virtue not the counterfeits
of virtue that wear the clothing no the essential virtue and you know when we listen
to music that is profound
we should be aware of the relationship to the concept of the muses in Greece in Greek
the musea those places where the muses prevail over above are instructive to
our otherwise mundane humanity to be possessed by the muses is not
perhaps at all demonic but rather angelic and to be possessed by angels could be as bad
as our imaginings of possession by demons
these two words are very peculiar and I may pursue their disambiguation a bit later but
for the moment what I will do is say something very strange suppose that there are intelligences
transcendental to those of humans and progenerative of those of humans
whose eros results in the possibility of minds right whose eros results whose relational and
enacted eros results in the possibility of minds and these beings are not as we imagine
black or white red or blue near or far past or future but are rather
always profusely dimensional dimensionalized and what happens when we relate with them
is that our modes and motives and desires collapse that multimodal
multi-dimensional transcendental potential toward something that matches up with our
gestures in the relationship and I will argue that all beings and situations are thus
and this is actually the fundamental principle on which
relatively conceptually ridiculous cults
that orbit the concept of quote manifestation unquote emerge from
suppose then that the field being the multi-dimensional field being
that we may experience as
a demon or an angel or a daemon an intelligent non-human
in what interlocutor
one with whom we have something resembling intellectual intercourse or
even more like the intercourse of intelligences
and the broad array of possible forms of eros
that lie beyond the act of getting our physical flowers involved in rubbing against each other
in some way rubbing up against things and I'm not casting aspersions on physical eros
I'm just saying that the library of eros of modes and forms and purposes of eros that is
that are accessible to us is so far beyond our imagining that often it's as if we're
trading the wrapping you know the envelope in which the wedding invitation arrives for the experience
of the wedding and the honeymoon and the children and the whole you know the whole actual
the whole of the living
intimacies the the forest and the oceans of the living intimacies that are not merely our birthright
and our natures they are our origins and perhaps in some sense our purpose of
more horrifying noises brought to you by human technique
they are the purpose of the living purpose of matrix from which our incarnations ensue
now one of the things that amans orations have
caused me caused my attention to turn toward because he seems to be saying things about
you know he seems to be a proponent of orgiastic frenzy under the influence of complex venoms
from snakes plants dusts human bodies he seems to be a proponent of the application
of elixirs formed in the bodies of women primarily and of orgiastic frenzy and perhaps even death
that is then obviated through the careful application of staggeringly sophisticated antidotes
the purple brah in his eyes
and he may well be it's up to him to assert his predilections
but what he has brought to fruition in my awareness what I have gleaned from exposure to his madness
which is itself like one of those elixirs when he's at his best right it's intoxicating
it's enchanting and one of the
one of the modulence of consent is enchantment hypnos trance this can modulate consent now
ordinarily um an actual hypnotist will uh
usually under most circumstances there might be some exceptions where the patients has already
agreed to treatment or so forth but they will um illicit consent right and one of the simplest
ways to do this that was the first way demonstrated to me is to just ask someone would you like to
feel better right now and i'm not offering that here because if i'm enchanting you you've already
given your consent by listening right you've chosen to have my voice in your ears so
the consent is there present and you also have the capacity to turn away if you find my
the spirit of my oration or my words or the these ideas objectionable as some will certainly do
i've often lost close companions over their objections to their interpretations of my
speech or writing and what they think i'm trying to do which almost which is almost never what
i'm actually trying to do well very rarely when they depart from me it's almost never what i'm
they've misconstrued me in some way usually very dramatically
nonetheless enchantment is a drug it uh it's an intoxicant
in the sense that it transforms the basis of our waking world awareness and the great
orators and sophists and the rapsodes of greece both were uniquely excellent in their capacity
capacity to enchant not merely with language but with music literally with the
you know i would not call them drugs i would call them
modes the modes of spirit the modes of the concentration of spirit meaning vital flow water
wind the modes of in structuring this flow over time that produce non-ordinary experience
we adore the brilliant poet the brilliant orator
uh arindati roi ursula keila gwyn
lin margullus
norah baitson tamson woolly barker on a good day
martin luther king john f canady nelson mandela
perhaps steven bico
before he was assassinated
the prophets
ibn arabi
i won't name prophets many i'm gonna carefully not name a few lau tzu
and those whose names i hear admit omit because we you know socrates himself wrote no books
and other prophets wrote no books and prophets that wrote books
or about whom books were written become very dangerous for us because those
the existence of those books tends to weaponize the humans weaponize their results
and this is as tragic as it is devastating to human awareness and intimacy and potential
where it is not actively liberating it becomes devastating
by the way that word deva that um
that word refers to something we know little of
intelligences from beyond the sky beyond time angels the davas the jinn the daimons the demons
the devils and again imagine that all those words actually refer to one form of potential
that much like uh the wasp
if related with intelligently and with awareness
this nearly will never harm you and may endow you with elixirs of wisdom and insight
from their people from their lineage from their future and i have been thus touched by a wasp
once in my life to my shock and tearful ecstasy
but if you threaten them now you have you want a demon they'll show you demons
you will regret drawing breath very quickly and and they will intoxicate you with their venoms
all right so what i am trying to say is that i have
in my own way drunk a little bit of the elixir from almond's cups
and the resulting intoxications have given me wisdom i can see better more deeply and one
of the things i see is that in our culture we celebrate possession okay those rock bands
the pop singers mcdonald's jack in the box
