our brilliant orators who are almost never our politicians for reasons so
ironic because these people should be very skillful sincere orators but they are neither
they are counterfeits
our police and our soldiers should be the liberators of the oppressed not
not the predators that act at the behest of the wealthy the slave owners the war makers
the warmongers the corporations which are in the worst sense demons and possess our lives
we are possessed they demand that we submit to their possession
while we work for them in the daytime in the nighttime
that is violation that is rape even when we consent because the consent is not free
we cannot see it is forced and it is primarily forced by the bizarre inhuman
demonic imposition of structured economies
that make slaves of us all and insult our ancestors and ruin our children
we celebrate possession think of the actors surely these human beings want to know
the breadth of the scope of the possibility of being possessed by a character they are not
a historical character a possible character a future character
you see the temporalization features here
roomy was possessed by the spirit of eros and wisdom the spirits of eros and wisdom
at the same time we're collapsing into intercourse inside his heart
right and he a helpless and not helpless he a brilliant participant in that magical eros
was so bold
as to experience the necessity
of making their music in the language he was familiar with
california's age
uh
it is exquisite california's sage brush magic alive in my hand
hi
the actors the orators you know in ancient greece socrates was
aamon speaks of the sting of the gadfly and how this is related to the concept of clistos
and this is specifically the vector along which dan mclellan attacks him
very effectively in my view dan's quite effective you don't want to have to face that guy he's got
nine swords where you have you know a teaspoon or whatever
though i'd like to see a face off i guess i'm not a huge fan of combat
and combat was really mostly about verity right veracity because it was believed primarily that
the non-human intelligences would pervade over the field and make known their
insights and preferences in the bodies of the victors but that's a broadly confused mistake
because often the vanquished are the holy victory is not is not equivalent to holy this is the
rape of the equal sign that my my conversational companion was talking about right victory equals
holiness nope not true nuance equals wisdom sensitivity awareness equals perception
you got some rules that you think apply to you know situations with a billion dimensions
you think you can collapse them down to two and then make a pick
um this is hubris of the most devastating kind this is the hubris that summons nemesis
to instruct you
you
we adore possession we celebrate celebrate possession if the christians or the muslims
wanted actual purity
i'm wiping the branch of the sagebrush across my eyelids
to cleanse my seeing if they wanted purity if they wanted fundamentalist devotion
which is almost always insane because it's not driven by any communication with the divine
or any fulfillment of some divine program protocol template for virtue rather it is schizogenic
it is the fulfillment of literal interpretations of dead text
and that will never be holy by the time you have to formalize the rules
there is no more communion you are lost there's no hope for you because your
the spirit wind of the communal vitality and virtue origin and purpose
and progeny progenial future an amniotic insight is dead and what you've got is bones
and you keep making boxes with them
by the time you have to tell humans that slaughtering each other is bad
the rules and laws can no longer help you
you
unless you resurrect the spirit of virtue in your mind heart and relations
and this must be discovered not declared
by the time you have to formalize the rules
you have the problem of individuals self-interest commodities
representations that stand in the absence of that to which they once may have somehow referred
and where you have representations of virtue
you have something like that
the fuck even is that it dominates the world and it's not even there it's not alive
somebody felt their right of way was violated so they decided to thunder to the whole planet about
it what even is that
I mean that's the malignant idea of a demon but here's the thing
as a musician and a poet and a writer I long ago began to experience situations in which
something took possession of me that wasn't me and was beautiful something I trusted
something fundamentally virtuous and intelligent beyond my capacities for virtue or intelligence
and it made songs it made poems it made essays it made orations and hopefully today if I am
unimaginably lucky there's some of that happening here
something in me something beyond me that isn't me that isn't merely me
I have invoked it
on purpose not because I am proud or skillful
because I am impassioned by the possibility of virtue
the opposite of that noise
that terrible noise of the mock eyes in energy systems
the beings that are not beings the hammer the engine the battleship the bomb the missile
the battle
almost all penetrative with the exceptions of the screens which are
gravidic
this word gravid means filled with eggs and filled with eggs we might imagine means
filled with billions of as yet unborn children and their intelligences filled with the wombs
of countless grandmothers of every possible kind not merely human
filled with the intelligences of the grandfathers
these sacred substances that Amman speaks of are sacred for reasons that are not vulgar
you
intelligence itself involves the reduction
of the personal identity to a minimal trace
and this is what is required in dreaming this is what is required in dreaming
the personal identity is no longer so explicit and our identity is spread out among all the
features of the dreamscape with which we are intimate in the dreaming
we
have the false possession of fake politicians and orators and then we have the real possession
of true politicians and orators which we very rarely see these days orders more and if the
if the fundamentalists were as fundamentalist as they should be if they're very very concerned
about us being possessed by anything other than the Holy Spirit quote unquote whatever I mean I
believe don't misunderstand me I'm not casting aspersions on that noble virtuous brilliant
light not by a long shot rather I'm very concerned about what the humans have made of it
but if they're very concerned they would tell us read no books because to read a book is to become
possessed and not merely of the mind of the author but of all of the minds that were pro-generative
of that author's concerns speech skills
the entire historical family that gives birth to this author's book and the entire family of those
who read it and and thus become its children it's fertilizing our minds we're having intercourse
with something above the human and we think oh no that's
that's just Aristotle that's just the bible that's just uh dune right that's just the origins of
consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind by julie and james that's julie and james
right frank herbert that's just arthur c clark um that's just you know the author it's never that
was never even possibly true there's no chance of that being true acts of musea draw us up above
our ordinary humanity and this is what we ache to experience and remember and become together
because the terrifying prison of our personal identity is a cascade of ever more furious
impoverishments that we must escape and this is why we are addicts this is why we go we are missing
the nectars of the intelligences above our humanity that we were born to interact with
and become together and and without these nectars we go to their substitutes nicotine media ideology
politics legality language
if real fundamentalists if you should only worship jesus if you should only worship mohammed
you will read no books
hello hi sweetie
because to read books is to become possessed and to be inseminated and
invaginated by their authors and you know some people say darin darin you've gone too far why
why do you have to use these these words that are indelicate
it because the delicacy is hiding something profound that we need to see together
eros is the fundamental basis of concern without it are there not things that you can't stand
are there foods you don't want are there forms of speech that you don't like
but the cause discussed in your cognition or mind are there noises that you don't like
do you prefer hot or cold would you rather be
unusually warm or unusually cold i don't mean to a lethal degree
are there flavors but you just you just don't want that in your mouth
how do you know how to navigate in consciousness is it not by affinity because if it's by affinity
and disaffinity then it's by eros and and her antithesis that you travel in consciousness
that you determine whether you agree or disagree with something is a matter of eros
from this useful perspective it's not the only one rationality we think is a rule-based system for
the determinative dissection of concept situations processes and predictions
but it there's a there's a factor in there that isn't merely rational
it's an amnoetic it's memory it's eros and eros and memory are fundamentally associated
in the human soul and so to the mind so to the body so to the behavior
so possession turns out to be nine-tenths of the law
in the most unexpected way right it didn't it didn't mean who's got the object in their pocket
rather it means
whose minds who are the minds with whom you are intimate
and whose intelligences are fundamentally trustworthy familiar true an amnoetic
anti-lethal unforgettable
now this leaves aside the
very complex implications well I'm not going to leave them aside there's another
array of implications in Amman's scholarship surrounding death and resurrection now I mean
imagine an ancient world where resurrection and death were relatively common and were part of
initiation rites right so that initiates knew that when they began the process of initiation
they were going to die or come extremely close to death and then at the last moment be resurrected
so that they could see beyond the veil right they would have knowledge
of the impossible of the forbidden and what is most forbidden of all things
the most forbidden thing is knowledge of death
when the little child what is his name in the hindu wisdom tale
I cannot right now located in memory the little child goes to visit the avatar of death and
do you ever sell your paintings
may I uh inquire about that
I understood why you were rude to me
I understood you were in trance and I was interrupting you the flaw is mine not yours
that's amazing that you remember
it's amazing that you remember we both remember
oh thank you for that sir
here is my my card my name is Darren what is your name Joe Joe a real pleasure to meet you Joe
your vision of color is unbelievably profound it's just magically
provocative I've never seen anything like that and I'm I'm an aficionado of painting I've never
seen light like that in your canvases is it okay yeah excellent yeah yeah
yeah and what I do is I I don't have a gallery or anything so I'm gonna bypass the gallery so
what I do is I just meet people like yourself and they come up to my house or go to their house or
whatever yeah yeah and then we just it's just an interpersonal thing we have to pay that's so much
more it's not just the paying of the gallery it's the uh it's the humanity of the relationship
right it's authentic right I appreciate that yeah I will I will be in touch with you Joe
I'm so grateful that we met today I am too that's ironic but the nicest person of the whole day and
I hope I wasn't too rude you know it's like I I I used I try not to be rude you know but once
I start talking because like I know you I know you're so interesting and a lot of other people
are quite interesting so I I forget about that and like you into the conversation which is wonderful
too yes you know it's an interpersonal thing it's very it is but I also have this problem that once
I start to make face noises my consciousness collapses into this right and that's a different
thing from writing or making music or making art right if you're writing you're not talking
making music you're not speaking maybe you could speak and cook
but I don't think I do this well you know well we're I come from Italians right and so in the
kitchen it's conversation and cooking they kind of go together but but yeah I'm cautious about
mixing I knew what I knew why you said no I was very clear in my heart no you just said no
that's all you did you didn't even say anything actually you didn't say anything you just said
that's all it's all you did no no I understood it's a little painful right because I'm like oh
I felt that I had intruded that's why it was painful it wasn't rude
no it's very nice to compliment me that way but yeah I appreciate your skillfulness the light
the way you play with the light I've known one or two other painters who can make light on the camp
make light come out of the canvas you know illuminate it yeah it's a spiritual thing
it's all good
right you only honestly one and a half but two hours so you know the light is going and then
I always cheat a little bit you know you cheat and you gotta do it but anyway you know it's
I just learned how to do this I'm so non-technical this
yeah oh yeah
it's like an it's like an enchantment you're making an enchantment it's it's like a magic thing
yeah yeah but it's you
but it takes all three and maybe something else it takes the canvas and the place and the light
and you and the sky yeah yeah the big spirit we agree this is what I'm making a recording about
right so some of my listeners will hear your voice I hope you don't mind oh that's okay
Darren okay good it's consent matters oh yeah yeah such a pleasure to meet you and to touch your
