human hand my goodness thanks for remembering that's of course I recognized you I'm so I love
me too it's the possibility yeah culture depth
um yeah all blessings peace
hmm that was a lucky moment that man's paintings are astonishing I've never seen anything like it
it they're just filled with this amazing living color and I approached him the other day and I said
may I speak with you for a moment and he just shook his head and it was a rebuke but I understood
what was going on all right so back to this topic right I'm on never before have I heard
anyone say and look my own the scope of my exposure is minimal but never have I heard anyone imply that
as part of initiatory traditions
we might be subjected to death and of course we have the concept
which is probably misapprehended from the French of orgasm as the little death and the association
between orgasm and death
as if orgasm is a is some kind of ecstatic suspension
of the rhythm and pulses that bind us to existence
out as if orgasm happens outside of time and this is the association with the non-human
intelligence there's the daimons the devas the jinn the angels you know I think demons and devils
are vulgar derivations of such ideas
but you know what Amon seems to be implying and I intend to inquire
of him about this is that there were initiatory rites and rituals and poisons involving
particularly the mixtures of venoms of various snakes and possibly other reptiles
mixtures of bodily secretions mixtures of plant substances very very complex pharmacopoeia
pharmacoya I'm I don't know the greek words I'll probably probably getting them wrong
um but I'm trying making the effort the essay and he implies that at least indirectly if not
directly that um the seers many of the seers and the prophets and the wise men had undergone
these initiatory rituals in which they were either killed or brought to the brink of death
and revived and try to imagine living in a world where death and resurrection is common
and so those who can resurrect you are messianic
and then we end up getting you know representational derivatives of this in the apocalypse and so
forth um and and the idea gets weaponized so that now only the elect are uh
uh
resurrection is accessible only to the elect or the sanctified or the the anointed
and that you have to go to this person and be anointed by this messiah or eternal suffering
and damnation or um just destruction obliteration
and so you know you can imagine that you know I once opined that um I mean I have a series of
essays on my blogger site which is called dream knots knot s and these are essays written when I was
under the influence of contact with a non-human intelligence in 2009 10 and beyond
and they are essays about conception and embryology they are
sygenic right it's there's a difference between orations and texts that are sygenic
and those that make the claim of fact
and the amazing thing about Amon is that his way of speaking and the topics that fascinate him
and his expression of them are fundamentally sygenic at least for me you know your your mileage may vary
and so it what it's it's not like I'm trying to say oh Amon he's got it right that's not what I'm
trying to say at all Amon's dance in the music of language is astonishing
and beautiful and profound
and enchanting in a way that if received in the proper spirit will produce insight right it will
generate that perspective up above where we normally
up above our normal habituate habituations
you know in cities that are not flat
primarily the wealthy live up high and that's not an accident the gods and the angels and
the daimons and and the devas and the jinn they are the habituates of the high places
which are closer to origin right if the sky is the most is the nearest representation of origin
then
to be closer to the to the sky is to be closer is to be proximal to the
originary intelligences the progenerative intelligences from which our minds and bodies
and ways of life and incarnations emerge right the matrix the womb
and the sky itself is it is it is as if it's a secondary womb there's a primary
there's a primary situation more than merely living situation
that the sky is an expression of in the same way that
in very still water in daylight you see
you look down into the water and what you will see is what's above you
you look down to see above this is very profound the light on the water sacred
so one can imagine that perhaps and this is just i'm asking you to see as if what i'm saying is
interesting or useful rather than to to say that it is true but
we are born from the lips beneath a triangle that points at the earth
it's literally as if there's a terrifying noise it's as if the mother's pubic hair is a cone
and the top of it is open and the point we emerge from this point
when we are when we have completed the embryo genesis the process of conception and embryo
genesis we emerge from this point into terrestrial existence and so if the egyptians
were trying to have and i don't believe that the pyramids are merely tombs not by a long shot
but if they wanted
their rulers to be resurrected in the world of origin they would invert that triangle
and give it more dimensionality make it three four dimensional actually right because time
right so make it last in time and make it three dimensional rather than two because
as you go up to the sky the dimensionality increases and so in death
the pyramid focuses
the ruler's essence and what is this ruler thing it means measure
it means measure correctly and to measure correctly
is to have true eros your eros is true it's divine it originates divinely and it does it's un
un it cannot be
occluded and it cannot be adulterated you have true eros this is what the rulers have those
things they hold in their hands the rod and the crook that rod is for threshing wheat
those pharaohs they held the crook there's actually another word for the rod that's
escaping me at the moment
the child who approaches death in the hindu myth i got distracted because i met joe the child
what did i do with his card
the child approaches death and he is met by death's retainers
and in this sense death is an avatar in this hindu important crucially important hindu story and
um what is the child's name come on hippocampus connect me to the memory
and death has another name as well the child's father has been performing the fire ritual
but uh in sincerely so giving you're supposed to give away everything that's important
to the monks and his father's giving the sick cows and the stuff he doesn't really
want to keep anyway he's sort of performing it half heartedly and the child says to his father
who's the child's very precocious and he says um oh father i see what you are doing as you are
giving the things you don't want away and not the things you do want to whom will you give me
oh father and the father says i will give you to death in anger
i'm gonna have to pause here because there's a terrible machine noise in my path
it's funny you know i tried to look it up which i very rarely do because i prefer to exercise my
memory my relationship with namosini mother of the muses whom i adore
and know to be a being not merely a mechanical
concept from which our idea of recording things in the in the dead shadow of which we have this
idea of recording namosini memory is alive vital multi potent omnipotent
woman of myriad potencies
uh
it's so funny the um
the jehovah's witnesses the women who are manning the little stand were talking about
someone buying a commodity for thirty dollars that was worth a lot of money and they both
thought that was really profound which is the explicit opposite of spiritual value
irony i'm not um i don't mean to defame them i'm just noticing the irony i think you know
i love humans and all of our delicate confusions are amazing
um
so i went to look up the story about this child his father's doing the fire ritual
and he says oh father to whom will you give me and i'm probably telling the story very poorly
i think my son caught it from sarva priananda and told it to me and this is a very clumsy
version of it but nachikaida is the child's name which came to me when i failed to find it in
attempting to look it up and he goes to the avatar of death who has another name that i cannot
remember but nachikaida's name is more important i think and um the avatar of death is like a
position that one acquires through merit and through meritorious um incarnations right through
being meritorious in in a sequence of lives and along with this position come a broad array of
benefits yeah and the one thing that can deprive one of those benefits is to fail to receive a
brahman's child generously and nachikaida seems to know something of this because when he goes to
death's house he basically back in the real world we must imagine he is dead okay and this is the
connecting thought here he is dead right his he's you know his father says i will give you to death
um but he doesn't mean i will kill you he means i will give you to the avatar
of death or whatever i think and so nachikaida says okay i'm gonna go i will i will give myself
to death and dies and then goes and visits death and death is out on an errand or hunting or something
and his retainers invite the child in and say come let us uh nourish you and comfort you
and nachikaida says no sorry stubborn and intelligent precocious child no i will wait
until death himself arrives
and so he waits and i guess it's it's three days or something and then death comes and is very
disturbed oh my oh no why are you outside did not my retainers secure you and nachikaida says
oh you know they did their job they they offered you know they offered me comfort and refreshment
and i uh declined and death says uh because this is the one thing that if not amended could
deprive death of the boons and benefits um to which the inaction of his station
entitles him presuming you know the genders here um
or the gender is even important which in some cases we should imagine it isn't
at all um beings right don't have to have gender
when we say organism gender is not indicated when we say animal gender not indicated
in any case uh so nachikaida is very canny and death says well what you know i'll give you three
boons whatever whatsoever you may ask i'll give you and nachikaida says i and i'm not sure of the
order here but he says i want when i return to life i am saddened that i have upset my father
i'm saddened that i've upset my father and i want him to love me just as profoundly
if not more profoundly than before than before i upset him because i essentially
nachikaida knows what he did he kind of sinned against his father by revealing
the imperfection of his ceremonial intention and inaction of the intention
by revealing that his father was duplicitous in his intention he has shamed his father
so he asks for for his father to love him just as he did before this and he asks for the secrets
of the fire ritual the deep secrets that are hidden the occult secrets of the fire ritual
and then it's the third thing he asks for where we get to the connecting thought here
the third thing he asks for are the secrets of death
and this is the thing at which death recoils and death tries to
entice nachikaida with worldly before nachikaida even makes his selection
and this is very common when divine beings meet human beings often first they will praise the
human being oh you are a special one we deeply appreciate you you're amazing and that's why
we've come right so they will they will try to you see what's going on here this is very profound
they will try to inflate the sense of the personal identity right which is actually the
thing you want to that's the prison that you've already become trapped in and they try to make
that prison look very shiny and they're like oh darren you you stand out among all the humans
a shining example we have noticed you we have deigned to notice you
here comes the trap and the danger you are so beautiful so intelligent you are truly noble
all these just praises and compliments which when authentic are not it's not really a problem the
problem is when we become intoxicated by personal identity again we're in the tiniest
trap like portion of our humanity and our nature our spirit it's not darren that's interesting
it's when he gets out of the way what possesses him when he steps aside what beauties
what ancients what progenitors what spirits what gods what angels come when he gets off the stage
and makes his his incarnation a stage for virtuous intelligences and muses artists so
so death offers nautica to worldly acclaim which is the common offer what would you like what can
i give you you've you've caught our attention we will grant you wishes what do you want
and one of the most intelligent answers i've ever heard to this question came
i think pretty sure from my friend sara who i am not speaking with at the moment but um
i think it came from her she said something like could we preserve the question while we get to
know each other better because i don't even understand what's going on here like i don't know
know what or who or how you are and i'm not sure what or who or how i am in relation with you
so why don't we preserve that question would that be okay that's a really interesting answer that i
like a lot um in any case death offers you know you can have fame you can have power you can have
women castles you can have uh insight intelligence court courtly adoration
long life health the ability to heal people you can be psychic and nautica is like
all those things fade away those are impermanent i want my father's love
i want the secrets of the fire ritual and i want the secrets of death and death right you know
recoils again especially at the third one and says no no i don't think you understand and
nautica says oh i understand these are these i'm serious these are the three things i want
and death is like yes but even the gods are not granted the secrets of death this is the key
right here right this is the forbidden knowledge the secrets of death that's the forbidden of
the forbidden that's the most forbidden thing anything you know one of my friends uh nathan
was asking me the other day you know i just don't understand what you mean by forbidden
and i said it is it is as if you are in a cage
and uh anything that reveals how the cage was composed what what the that reveals the bars of
the cage to your awareness that reveals the history of the cage or that
gives you intelligence about the prison in which you find yourself ensconced
in your incarnate humanity those are the orbits of the forbidden knowledge
and death is the sudden and perhaps nearly complete
evacuation of the cages suddenly you're outside them you can see from outside
all of that knowledge seeing outside the um the traps of our incarnate waking consciousness
anything that leads us out of that is forbidden but the thing that fundamentally leads us out
of that is death and this is why you have like um i mean this is why you have initiation the
knowledge is protected because it's forbidden uh and this is why when you go for example to
meetings of ians right the international association of near-death studies and you hear
the stories of people who died or very nearly died you know everyone will say not everyone
some some skeptics will say for example um this bird doesn't know me
no some skeptics will say no one has died if you die you don't come back
well they're wrong about that i mean it just it's what part of what they're saying is um
