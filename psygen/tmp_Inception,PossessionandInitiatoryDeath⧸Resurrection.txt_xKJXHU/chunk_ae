if you don't carefully set where the cut in your consciousness is what you mean by death if you
don't carefully set that to mean that from which you don't come back then you're just that's not
really death but there's lots of people who's you know brains they were brain dead they were
heart dead they were not breathing they were dead they were out of their body looking down
into the operating room or whatever they were you know or they were in oblivion right some of
the people who've died and come back say there's nothing there there was nothing i have no memory
no nemosony right there's no nemosony over there
yeah this is the forbidden topic so imagine that in the ancient world death and resurrection
were fairly common and healing was associated with the capacity to resurrect dead people
as was messianism as was wisdom and this is part of what aman is implying if not directly stating
even though his um the pictures he paints are erotically profligate right there they're very
much about like sex orgies and you know intoxications and drug use and psychedelics mixed with snake
venom and the purple in your eyes made out of the substances that are unspeakable
but he's like a raging prophet when he starts talking this way and in a sense
he's saving us from the necessity of having to engage directly in such debauchery
um by somehow representing it in his tone and his errations and his cadences right it's very
profound you know later perhaps i may think other things but for the moment i'm quite grateful to
his um bizarre and wild spirit yeah the way he the way he shapes the mind
his music it's helped me see things i've never before understood and just to circle back to them
um we adore possession this is why we watch films we want to be possessed but there's
nothing good to possess us and so the religions are in a way saying like this is the best thing
to be possessed by this is the only thing to be possessed by be possessed by the spirit of truth
be possessed by the divine justice be possessed by the prophet be possessed by the one who the
prophet serves and only this one and no other possessions hilariously jesus says effectively
give up all your possessions by which we think he means our belongings and you know um
no man with a camel will pass through the eye of the needle the eye of the needle is a space
that lets you into the city after dark where it's a tunnel that's only wide enough to pass through
with your unencumbered body so that you cannot bring goods that can be exchanged for money
without paying tariffs into the city or out of the city at night it's a metaphor and it's probably
a metaphor in nine ways other than that one as well but there's another sense of it which is
be not possessed by anything other than the spirit of truth uh
yeah yes yes
there's so much more here to cover but i've managed to circle most of the crucial elements for today
um i'm so grateful to have traveled these paths in my own awareness thought and concern
i feel as if i've risen above the stations of my ordinary waking consciousness and
and my personal identity somewhat successfully today that's a precious gift for which i'm humbly
grateful thank you for joining me i wish you beautiful ways and paths and dreams and relations
adventures and fulfillments i look forward to learning again together for each other
very soon bye bye for now
