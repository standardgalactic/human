teachings of tradition, the meaning became largely habitual and mechanical. In the way
indicated earlier, the subtlety was lost and men began to say simply, measure is illusion. Thus,
both in the East and in the West, true insight may have been turned into something false and
misleading by the procedure of learning mechanically through conformity to existing
teachings, rather than through a creative and original personal grasp of the insights implicit
in such teachings. Now, this is very important because it places the agency with each of us
and with us together in conversation and discovery, again, rather than on any external
standard or context. I hope that you found this exploration somewhat useful and interesting.
I know I have, and we will continue to learn and discover more about the interplay between the
zero and the one, the gestalt and the parts, true metonymic relationships between whole and parts,
and those that are fictionally assembled for purposes that are often confusing and self-conflicted.
I look forward to that process together. Thank you for joining me.
