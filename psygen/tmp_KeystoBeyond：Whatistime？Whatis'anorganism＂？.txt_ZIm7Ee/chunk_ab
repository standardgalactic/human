cell you're probably gonna get the equivalent of about I'm just gonna kind
of make up a number as soon as the machines get done here
I have to compete with these right just to talk with you and we're losing this
competition you spin a cell around the Sun one time which probably gonna get
something like 500,000 cell years so and and while you're doing that that
cells gonna divide and become maybe thousands hundreds of thousands
millions of cells much like we ourselves might and so you're not just gonna get
one cell year or a hundred thousand cell years you're gonna get all of the years
of all of those cells and all of the relational time between them how much
time is that well it's so much time that you can't make a number about it
there's no way to possibly make a number about it and here's the thing if you
spend just one human okay around the Sun one time you get that one human life
here but the problem is you are 50 trillion animal cells and you are 500
trillion bacterial cells and all of the different ways that those relay so
in that one year you are more time than humans have ever imagined about any
number they've ever invented ever ever but that's still not the depth of it
because life began on earth at some point in history right and since then all
of the organisms on earth and all of their relations and all of their organs
and their cells and their mitochondria and their organelles and their bacteria
and their viruses have all been madly relationally being in time together and
so there was an origin of life on earth and that's been going on for about 3.5
billion flat years that we can count and while that's been happening life never
stopped so first of all your personal age is is is an expression a living
expression of that whole process which means number one even outside of the
exotic model I'm showing you here you're as old as life on earth so if you were
born on earth you start out 3.5 billion years old even in regular time you're
not one year old when you're one you're as old as life on earth whatever however
in whatever way you want to measure that yeah but then if you look at the the
mode of time that I'm talking about which is relational it's absolutely
factual you can see it right two humans going around the Sun one time is two
different human life years and the relationships between them and the
relationships with all of nature and everything so the first thing I want you
to see is you were conned you were told ridiculous stories about time that are
so incredibly dumb founding that they're almost impossible to escape into any
kind of intelligence the first thing I want you to realize is that you're
older than any number that's ever been made in so many different ways that you
could never finish exploring them and and just by seeing this you can see how
already the ways that we think about ordinary things like what is time what
is an animal when you're looking at an animal okay you're looking at something
billions of times the age of the universe why didn't science or religion
tell you that why didn't they show you the very simple fact that the way we
talk about time is a fiction and it's a deadly fiction because it implies totally
ridiculous things about how old we are and because we we can't understand how
old we are we can't understand what it means to be a human being or to be an
animal or to be a living world or what time space is really about because we're
just one planet in space but how many planets in space are there and for 4.5
billion years all of these planets many of which almost certainly have life
forms on them have been playing this astonishing game with time an organism is
to time okay as a sun is to light we're time stars we make billions of kinds of
time that we don't even have language that allows us to look into I'm trying
to give us some of that language now so the first thing I want you to understand
okay is that you're more astonishing than all of science and all of religion
right now right now you don't have to do anything you don't have to learn
anything more you have to be anything different just be yourself and forget
about the models of time that you were shown in human culture because they'll
destroy your intelligence once you realize that your actual age is so
astonishingly beyond the whole idea of time that doesn't even it won't even fit
inside science okay there's no religion that can contain this there's no
language that can that can express to you the unthinkable relational symphony
of billions and trillions of lives in mad furious relational development that
is just your single body right and think about the implications of this when
we when we get past this because I'm gonna need to go on to other topics the
first thing I just want you to understand it's very simple is you're older than
everything not by like 10 factors or a hundred factors you're older than
everything by a billion factors and if science ever tries to compare you to a
machine you know like like this pen and says like this machine can be
intelligent okay the weird thing about this machine is it doesn't have that
relationship to time at all and it never will it can't okay a machine is just an
object it's not relational because it's not relational it doesn't have that same
kind of time this is actually the actual age they say it is if this was built a
year ago this is exactly one year old if you were born a year ago you're older
than all the time humans have ever counted you will never be a machine your
brain is nothing like a computer has nothing to do with computation nothing
computation is a metaphor okay and it's the wrong metaphor for organisms
organisms do not have functions those are a fiction made up by people that
want you to think that you're an object you will never be an object these things
exist in flat time you exist in transcendental relational time luckily
now you have a little bit of an idea how astonishing this kind of time is and
how ridiculous the other kind is never believe the myth that machines have
anything in common with you I'll give you another example medicine if your heart
starts to die I can put an artificial heart in you okay and that might keep
your blood pumping and that might keep you alive no problem I get it but here's
the thing because your heart is living and it's forms of billions of organisms
and all those organisms are relationally intelligent and relationally
temporal in the way that we've discussed your heart has more functions than
science has numbers functions right in other words it does more kinds of
relational those actually those aren't functions that relations but it does more
kinds of relational super function then there are numbers to talk about it one
heart does that okay so when they put a mechanical heart in you that just pumps
blood what you get is a machine like this it has flat relational time relation
time age and it's not relational it does one thing and that's pump blood your
heart does billions of things think science will never discover in the next
10,000 years so to call the machine that they put in you a heart is completely
ridiculous right that would be like calling your mother I don't know what a
fork there's no way you could be born of a fork it has a function but it's not an
organism so you have nothing in common with machines and the people that want
to tell you that they're gonna build like an artificial intelligence they don't
know what intelligence is trust me they have not the slightest idea what they're
talking about our flat functions in flatly temporal a relational objects
over here with actual intelligence what you have is these time stars right that
are explosively relational in so many ways will never finish discovering them
and once you tell people and they begin to learn about their actual nature as
beings whole new forms of intelligence blossom naturally out of them because
that's what they are we were born to be to have a relationship with intelligence
the same way we have with time to be intelligence stars where whole new
forms of intelligence constantly emerge and develop and evolve and explode into
exotic beautiful expression as us but the first thing that has to happen for
that to be destroyed is we have to be told really ridiculous stories by
religion and science and gurus about what it means to be human and what it
means to be alive and what death is and all these kinds of things and once we're
told all those ridiculous stories we can basically be enslaved in them for the
rest of our lives and we'll convert our friends to them we'll argue about them
and all these kinds of things instead of discovering what's actually going on now
I want to talk a little bit about intelligence okay one of the most
shocking things that ever happened to me it nearly killed me was that I had a few
moments about three seconds of contact with the mind of an insect yeah it
nearly killed me we don't because we don't know we don't because we have the
wrong idea about what an organism is what the sun is what the earth is what
time is what intelligence is we don't understand what organisms are at all and
let me explain to you any organism that you can encounter is more than all
science by billions of factors it's more than all of religion by billions of
factors it's more than any kind of space being you've ever thought of or imagined
any organism okay an ant a slug a tick a mosquito anything it's more intelligent
and more astonishingly relational than all of human stories all of human
religion all of human computation in fact a single organism is so sophisticated
that if you take the entire history of human technological development all the
way until our species dies it will never catch up with a ladybug okay never never
partly because of what I've explained to you about time and relational time
you can't make machines they come anywhere near organism and the reason is that machines
have flat temporal a relationality that's the first problem they're not temporally
relational in the way organisms are and secondly they have functions we don't have functions we have
super functional relation and it makes explosively astonishing evolutionary development
thousands of billions of times per picosecond you're never going to make any kind of machine
that comes anywhere near an organism's complexity ever not in the whole history and future of mankind
so I want you to just forget that whole myth completely flush it down the toilet it's a lie
and it cripples you because it models you as an object and once you have that model you start
acting and thinking that way I want you to see my model okay you're a relational time star you
have in you forms of intelligence and ability so shocking that if you took the whole sum of the
stories of superheroes that would be like a piece of poopy toilet paper compared to what you were
born as and you've been lied to so dramatically and so astonishingly commonly that you've never
been able to encounter them now we're going to start playing with these things together
not to make new religions not to make gurus or books just to discover what we what it means to
be alive in nature now a little while ago I was telling you about a very terrifying experience
I had and that experience was a few moments of contact with the mind of a single insect
it was a dying wasp
I had known the hive that she was the queen of I recognized her the hive had been poisoned by
my landlord but instead of dying she went into hibernation unfortunately when she awoke she was
still poisoned her wings were gone and she was dying and she knew it I don't know why I don't
understand how it happened but somehow for a moment she touched my mind our minds went together
and in that moment she transmitted a vision of information a visionary form of intelligence
and information it lasted about less probably less than two seconds I fell down on the ground
what I experienced in that moment was so shocking that I could barely survive it
I learned more in those two seconds than in all my 36 years of life okay I learned more
in those two seconds than in 36 years of all my study and research and observation
and I learned so much more that it would be ridiculous to try to compare it so I didn't
learn 10 times the amount or a hundred times the amount this kind of information that was
just given to me as a gift was a form of intelligence so shocking that
it makes all that what humans know look very primitive and it I went into shock actually
I went into kind of intelligence shock because what I had received in those few seconds was the
history of the wasp beings on earth all of their adventures all of their battles and contact with
challenges and catastrophes in nature on earth with humanity in an instant
just one moment of transmission and please don't think of this as a download because this has
nothing to do with technology this is nature okay and the metaphors that we use in technology
are broken don't use them don't use the words don't use the language forget them we need different
ways of understanding this or we're going to stay in the same trap so what I want you to understand
is that I'm a pretty intelligent guy in my own way and I've learned a lot I study all kinds of
aspects of science and biology and nature and technology music art language my whole life yeah
so very intelligent guy I've had all kinds of unusual experiences yes I've done various kinds
of drugs and things in my life so I know what psychedelic experience is about let me be really
clear the wildest psychedelic experience that I've ever had which was pretty shocking compared to
what happened in this two seconds with the wasp that wild psychedelic experience was like I didn't
even know how to how to how to make a comparison it was a piece of garbage I wouldn't have zero
interest in it none I wouldn't even look in the direction of psychedelics ever again after one
moment contacting the mind of another living intelligence on earth so what I want you to
see really clearly is absolutely without any kind of drugs right without any kind of religion
without any kind of science you are made to contact nature in ways that you've never been
allowed to discover and if you were allowed to discover those outside of human culture
completely outside of all the models you've been told of things right you're going to have an experience
so ecstatic and so shocking and so intelligent that you're going to have a difficult time just
surviving it it will transform your mind not just in that moment but in waves and pulses
that go on and deepen over time now now since then thankfully I've had many such experiences
and with with many kinds of intelligences not just those of insects but what I want you to
be really clear about is this every living thing that you see around you
is a billion fold more interesting than what you think contact with an alien from space would be
like every single living thing a blade of grass a grasshopper a butterfly a bee a tree a mushroom
anything and I don't want you to think in the terms of the nature religions the pagans
Terrence McKenna and all those people those people are completely deluded they absolutely
failed to deliver anything except more cages throw that away forget everything you've heard okay
and the reason is you need to take off all of the lies and ideas that human culture has
implicated in you and and sort of injected into you and and forced you to believe and think and
actually just take all that off and in pure innocence and with a beautiful purpose right
go back to the sources of life intelligence relation purpose and beauty because when you do that
free of all human culture you are going to have experiences beyond anything that's ever been in
any book and after even one of those experiences just one okay you will never be interested in
reading anything about adventure because your life will become an adventure so astonishing
that no film you've ever seen even looks interesting it actually looks like a piece of junk that you
wouldn't even want to touch the same thing is true of the wildest stories of superheroes and
adventures you are more than the sum of all of human culture and not by like one or two factors
by billions of factors so what I want you to understand is the toys that human culture
gives you to play with actually destroy your mind they separate you from each other right
