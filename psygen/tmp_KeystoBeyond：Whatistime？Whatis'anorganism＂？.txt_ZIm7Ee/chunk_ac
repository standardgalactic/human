they separate you from nature and they separate you from the living sources of intelligence
that are absolutely everywhere believe me when I tell you a very simple thing there's no need to
travel in space okay what we have here is more than we could ever find in space travel and the
reason is that the way that space and time are organized the way that their structure works and
it's a living structure by the way is such that on every world in space all of the intelligence
of all of the other worlds is locally available no one's paying any attention because they're in
love with machines and religions and ideas so stupid that are actually that our actual intelligence
can't survive exposure to them and we just get pounded with that noise and pounded with that idea
and pounded with the religion and pounded with the incredibly primitive products of our current
science and we're told that all of these things are holy and divine and advanced it's a con game
it's a total lie you yourself are a billion fold more than that and the moment that you begin to
realize that you don't need a teacher okay you don't need a book you don't ever need any machine no
machine can deliver to you more than you yourself brought with you I promise you this is true you
will have this experience if you simply understand some of the ideas I presented here now today
particularly the one about time realize how old you are you're older than any kind of old you've
ever heard and what that means is you're more sophisticatedly relationally intelligent than
anything you've ever been exposed to and you can't be exposed to it because it's so explosively
self-transcending every instant that you could never catch up with it right no description you
could make could catch up with the incredible age and intelligence that you just keep being every
moment I mean think about it 50 trillion animal cells 500 trillion bacterial cells probably
a thousand fold more organelles which are the tiny little organisms inside cells
those things live at a rate of time that even a few seconds is probably like a year for an organelle
you are such an astonishing amazing being that no description will ever come anywhere near you
no religion could hope right to deliver what you are those things are broken toys they're the
toys of prisoners that have been trapped and crushed down so that they can be taken advantage of
by parasites and predators this is actually what the old stories in Genesis are talking about
they're talking about the fact that there's two sort of modes of intelligence right one of them
is absolutely organismal it's it's just beings and animals in relation and that form of intelligence
is so transcendental that it explosively transcends itself trillions of times per second
you want a taste of that and when you get a taste you're going to barely be able to survive the
slightest whisper of it right and you're going to be so shocked that it may take you years to recover
yeah and then maybe you'll go back for a second taste hopefully your mind will survive that
having some discipline right having like um a meditation practice or some kind of a practice
where you've built careful discipline so that you can remain sober emotionally even when you're
immersed in shockingly unthinkable waves of novelty and intelligence you're going to need a
little sobriety or it'll it'll mess up your mind right kind of go nuts but that I don't want you
to be afraid I want you to just realize as you're as you're pursuing this path choose a path where
you can build some sobriety and self-discipline because it will help you when you suddenly have
to encounter something like my encounter with the wasp and my encounter with the wasp is one of the
smallest encounters I've had right I'm giving you a tiny taste there I barely survived it and when
when the wasp gave me that gift with it came a responsibility and the responsibility was to use
this gift purposefully in a beautiful purpose that would help to redeem her suffering and death
right that would help my people our people to discover our true identity the identities that
have been stolen destroyed shattered and then they sell us back little broken representations
of them which we get like a tiny spark from and think like well that felt good but I need another
one and so we go back to the guru we go back to the religion we go back to the science it's just
those are just toys go ahead and play with them but please don't believe them right they're absolutely
lies about identity the same thing that I've shown you about time is true about animals it's true
about dreaming it's true about intelligence it's true about language what we think language is
we're completely wrong about what you think language is and I will show you in pieces over time
so we've undergone this kind of id theft yeah but it's the big theft right it's the theft of
what our actual nature in relation with the universe is I want you to be really clear about
one thing everything that you would hope to discover in the farthest reaches of space or time is right
here on earth as you as me as our living environments and notice something the parasites
and the predatory representational cultures are burning all that down they want to eradicate
the ecosystems for the sake of automobiles yeah and little computers that you hold in your hand
you're hypnotized by right this thing that you hold in your hand with a light in it it's a
representation of something something that I've rediscovered for myself if you had any idea what
this thing was a representation of you would smash this thing and you would attack everyone you ever
saw and you'd realize that's a deadly mimic we got to get rid of that right now what you call the
internet is a representational replacement for something that if you again if you touched it
once even for an instant you'd be hard pressed to survive it and the reason you'd be hard
pressed to survive is that you'd die of ecstasy ecstasy of your mind blossoming into forms of
non-human intelligence that are absolutely unimaginable to ordinary people no one has touched
them there's no religion on earth that's gotten anywhere near this and the people who wander
around telling you like they're the arcturians or the pleidian blood those people have actually
just made up a fantasy story and are lying madly through their teeth and will deliver
none of the kinds of information knowledge and keys that I'm going to give you for free
all day every day until I'm gone and believe me when I tell you I'm carrying more information
than I could possibly communicate to you in 10,000 lifetimes right I'm just trying to give you the
tiny hair right right now what I'm what I'm hanging on to so that we can just like share this little
thing taste it see how you know see how it works and learn together that's my only goal because
here's the problem they split us all apart yeah and first they stole our nature and identity then
they then they divided us from nature itself which is the source of all of these intelligences
so it wouldn't have any access to them then they gave us machines to replace those relationships
and by the way that thing that you drive around in a car that's a replacement for something you
might want to know what that what got replaced yeah because it's more shocking than if someone
gave you an intelligent spacecraft capable of translate velocity and you have one okay you're
born with one of those yeah but instead you got a motorcycle or a car and once you got the car
you'll never discover the other thing it was a representation of same thing with the models of
time once they give you a watch then a calendar you'll never discover what time is about right
and this is the same thing with all of the representations in our culture that story in
genesis about us at the tree that's about this right there's two forms of intelligence one of them
is deep and true and impossibly sophisticated if we were to encounter it it's going to seem
divine for sure there's no other way to understand it it doesn't mean we have to have religions it
just means it's so far beyond anything we ordinarily talk about that we don't know what to call it so
we call it divine fine no problem but let's not make religions about it let's discover
more and more about it and not trap ourselves in cages and not write books and make records that
freeze us with certain ideas because in order to follow these keys out of our cages we have to do
this really interesting thing which is we have to keep dissolving our ideas behind us yeah instead
of replicating them and telling them to you and making books no no no no no no no no to catch
what what this is is a following game yeah so we follow intelligence and learning and
shocking revelation forward and we just dissolve the representations of that behind us like fuel
right we're doing the opposite we stop still build a bunch of representations in front of us
and then just stay behind them yeah and those representations are absolutely crippling stupid
all of them every single one of them right so I want you to forget about human culture right
completely you can keep the the ideas but don't believe any of them realize they're broken toys
that will trap you if you replicate them and that's what they want you to do they want you to
replicate them convert your friends argue in their favor their fictions why would you argue in the
favor of a fork does it need your support really no it doesn't living beings in places need your
support we need each other's intelligence so here's what I want to get at another way our
intelligence is stolen is by separating us from nature first and giving us machines instead
and then separating us from each other and giving us ideologies instead right science religion
gurus um you know the new age uh books and fictions and fandom and rock bands and sports
right that's hilarious they build teams to to to accomplish miraculous nothing and then people
get so excited they kill each other over it really really let me tell you what that's a
representation of okay in the same way that calendar time is nothing like living time most
of the things we do in culture are nothing like what we would do if we just had each other if we
just had a deep relationship with nature because there's no way we'll ever ever be able to exhaust
the depth of those things but I want to make one thing really clear nature doesn't have a purpose
nature is infinitely purposive it generates new forms of purposive beings and moments and
possibilities billions of times per second right so if you have a purpose you're broken
you're dead in the water you're going nowhere what you need is purposive inspiration
relational uh intimacy and intelligence yeah and the capacity to to form little family like
units with those assets and then chase them forward in the development that's what nature's
doing that's not what humans are doing humans build representations and stop there and they
burn down nature and intelligence to build up the representations and make those godlike see how
that works it doesn't work so here's the last thing that I want to give you um before I wind
this up thank you for staying with me so long if you have a truly noble purpose okay a purpose so
beautiful that all living beings would basically agree and then be like yes please that's worth
chasing right what kind of a purpose might that be well it might be just the purpose of nature
herself if your purpose matches natures she'll recognize you in a sense not that she's a she
but you can think of her that way the other thing I want you to understand is that earth is an
intelligence so sophisticated you're never going to find anything more sophisticated you don't have
to go to space forget about going to space you don't need to everything we need is right here
and it's right here in such shockingly profound abundance that we've just overlooked it and we
keep looking up at the sky and going like can I go up there can I go up there can I go up there
why don't you look at what's right here because what's right here is a concentrated localized
version of everything in all the time space all the possibilities of space travel are right here
on earth and we don't need to burn up anything or make any kind of machine to encounter those
directly to relate with them to become intimate with them to learn with them they are the living
beings of our world they are the living ecologies of our world and we've overlooked them entirely
and are burning them down to make machines to fly into space which we don't have to go there
to get any of the things that we think might be out there they are here that's the nature of time
space the last thing I want to say is this a small human group five people okay reconnected
with their actual intelligence reconnected with nature with a beautiful purpose reconnected
with each other right with the body of unity this is as if this was their purpose yeah these five
people reconnected in the old way free of human culture with some sense of the corrections and
ideas that we can encounter by learning these new ways together five people can change this planet
in a month and that's what everyone's terrified of that's why we have all the representations
five people can defeat any force that human culture has ever assembled and not just defeated
they could transform it they could turn the whole thing into an asset in a month that's how
powerful we actually are that's why all of the parasites and predators are constantly seethingly
at work to crush us down and the story in Genesis is kind of about this it's a key actually the
medicine is in that first story of the tree you don't have time to explain it here but understand
this there were two forms of intelligence right and one of them was authentic and natural and
transcendental and the other one was hypothetical and could make all kinds of little theoretical
divisions like science or like language itself when we tasted this one it changed how we saw
the world and our minds and we became actually kind of paranoid which is why we realized that there
was there wasn't so much that there was evil right but we realized that it was hypothetically
possible that something could be evil maybe we're evil and then we got really scared so apparently
something really funny happened they took the leaf of one of the only plants on earth
that has a microscopic flower you can't see its flower and they hid their genitals with that flower
because they were afraid that the divine universe of intelligence would see that they'd eaten from
the tree and they then saw that it might be wrong to be naked maybe we're supposed to be clothed
like in like the animals have fur yeah and so they tried to hide themselves yeah and they kept
hiding themselves and they kept hiding themselves and they kept hiding until our day today right
we're we're completely hidden in every possible way we're buried in deadly poisonous wrong
representations that cripple us destroy our intelligence and deny us our basic the basic
assets of our humanity the history of life on earth our true nature is living beings and they
compare us to machines i want to say one other thing there's no such thing as evil trust me
evil is a trick yeah it's a trick that was played by the representational aspect of our minds
which tends to be associated with our left hemispheres right side of our body this is the
hemisphere that actually rules all of our cultures and produces all the false collectives yeah that
we're struggling with it's not bad in and of itself we need to not not don't get mad at the
left hemisphere you just need to realize it's very dangerous when it's disconnected from its sources
in nature and transcendental intelligence i want to thank you for staying with me this long we're
going to learn way more amazing things than this but with this one key about how old you are and
how old any organism that you see is i want you to understand something very simple your mind is the
actual platform of perfect contact with all of the forms of intelligence on earth it's as if earth
invented the most exquisite possible communion element right and then put this in you so you
were actually a creature who evolved specifically to unify and magnify the entire ring of
intelligences on earth and those intelligences are more sophisticated than anything it's possible
to imagine and they're like if you could imagine standing in the center of the sun there are a
billion fold more productive than that relationally right we are something no one has ever been able
to tell us and it's so exciting that if any of us get any kind of a taste of it there's nothing
that can stand in our way we will be unstoppable beautiful and we won't make war we'll make
transformation in waves of unbelievably beautiful intelligence we will save our world we will
transform our cultures we will retrieve our humanity our intelligence and our power to form
little collectives that can accomplish miracles overnight we'll retrieve it instantly right the
moment that we stop believing all of the lies and broken models of identity that our language and
our culture and our science and our religion are pouring down on our heads constantly and telling
us we're advanced by the way science tells you you're made of stardust they're completely wrong
you are the expression of the living star that is our sun you're an organ of that sun the same
way this finger is an organ of my body okay you're not made of stardust they want you to
think you're a dead object right and they're telling you it's so exciting you're made of stardust
they're making you stupid okay and they're telling you that that's advanced it's the same thing in
religion they're telling like you're the divine child they never delivered any experience of that
what they gave you was a fantasy that your left hemisphere can cling to and pretend like this
will save me from being destroyed and from being evil there's no such thing as evil evil simply means
you got it backwards you bought the representation instead of inhabiting the organism that's all
right there's no mean judgment thing in the sky at death none what's going to happen at death
is actually an encounter with pure intelligence and that's going to be like a kind of a dreaming
experience but a thousand fold more powerful yeah and the reason that i know this is that
i've had this experience not once i've had it about 15 times yeah you don't have to be afraid of
death ever again there's no evil there's no such real thing as an afterlife either what there is
is so astonishing that none of the human stories can capture it and you want a taste of that and
you want to taste while you're alive don't wait for death okay when you've seen salmon swimming
up waterfalls which is totally impossible obviously to get back to their birthplaces
that's what happens to us at death but if you do the same thing while you're still alive what you
