encounter is intelligence and wonder and beauty beyond anything you beyond the sum of human endeavors
right so far beyond anything you can imagine that you'll just you'll cease to exist in your previous
form and you will be absolutely transformed by it i hope you will get a taste of what you brought
with you because this is your exploration your adventure it's totally for you it has nothing
to do with me it's not something i made up if you just get outside of human culture go get a taste
of exactly your nature your relationships in nature what we're calling nature you're going to
discover much more than i've said here you will surpass me a thousand fold that's my goal don't
buy my book don't believe i'm a guru take the take these little keys i've given you and play with
them like a child and find out what they point to because i promise you you're going to have an
adventure beyond the sum of human stories and it will give you the power and the ability and the
insight to accomplish any beautiful purpose the most important thing have a beautiful purpose
realize you're more than all the stories in language learn to escape the cages that language
and concepts build and realize those are toys not laws never let any authority stand above you
none none don't do it what you want to do is lift nature up above you and then look up
to the living beings the insects the animals the ecosystems the history of life on earth
act as the living avatar of those forces and momentums act in their name for their purposes
and you will be endowed with gifts beyond anything any religion could ever describe
beyond anything science will achieve in the next 10 000 years that is my hope that is the
inspiration that i have to share with you today thank you for spending this time with me more
to come my friends so much more bye bye for now
