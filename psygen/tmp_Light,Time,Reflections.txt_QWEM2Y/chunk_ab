and here's a broken piece of sage something divine was with us and then departed we did not know
why we did not know why and since we did not know why like children we made up stories in some of
those stories the brightness went away because we were bad the divine light of origin that was at
some point in our history present to our experience and awareness disappeared behind clouds and we
might have decided that's because we were bad of course I think most of us would agree that cloudy
days that hide the Sun don't happen because we are bad now they can it's not impossible right we
can change the atmosphere we can be bad in such a way that the atmosphere changes clouds up all
the time and we don't see the Sun anymore that's conceivable as you know as a species but probably
not as individuals so I like to think that there is something analogous to a meta Sun something
transcendental that the Sun that we're familiar with is a material expression of and that over time
our species has experienced something analogous to weather in our relationship with this transcendental
light of living light of origin and I guess when I say living what I mean is more than merely a force
it's not simply a mechanical phenomenon and if we look all around us though science has framed
nature in terms of mechanics because this is what science is good at and does it's very clear that
that description or that explanation is entirely insufficient to capture the spirit in the eyes
of a child or a grandmother or a raccoon or a bluejay or a cat or a dog or even the the spirit
available to those who are sensitive enough to detect it in plants in living places in moving
waters on which the light is dancing so when I think of the history of our species and the
very confusing questions that surround our religions I am want to suspect that we've
experienced something like weather our distant ancestors it's funny when I when I went under
this little bow my machine made more brightness in the image that's really funny so it got
darker for me while it got brighter on the camera hmm peculiar I'm fascinated by this this idea
that over over the history of the cognitive and relational evolution of our species there has
been weather and we may have affected that weather the onset of machines the discovery the sort of
birth of science these things changed our ideas they changed our orientations our perspectives
you can hear probably in the background now the noise from the machines nearby so I suspect that
some of what we did as a species transformed our relationship with that transcendental transcendental
sun or star or light of origin and maybe hit it from us much more thoroughly than would have been
possible had we not had our species taken a different path right oh here's a beautiful
beautiful red red hawk on this limb it's sharpening its beak I wonder if
it's really hard to hold this still I'm not used to it
it's even harder if you magnify it right because then the little tremors of my hand
become very significant yeah it's a beautiful animal really gorgeous
so I wanted to share with you this this toy this this idea that over human history there are
there are days when days there are epochs when the light of origin is more or less
perceivable to our people and there are times in which the analog of the sky that lies between us
and this light of origin that analog sky is cloudy or perhaps we ourselves have clouded it and
we no longer sense the presence of this light that funds our own spirit our emotions our hearts
our intelligence our creativity and may even in character the activities of our societies
may contribute to the character of those activities so if there's an invisible sun
that everyone's heart is an expression of right this isn't just to say it gives us light we might
very well be those those aspects of our inwardness that we refer to as our souls might be the direct
expressions of our filial our family relationship with this invisible sun
and that over history there have been transformations in that relationship and there continue to be
and then of course even within a single human life right we don't have to take the entire
history of mankind or life on earth even within a single human life there are there is a time
when the light of origin is near at hand right and though we do not recognize it it moves us as
children to play it moves us to joy to be silly to be beautiful to be very expressive to be frightened
to be alone to be confused right when it is missing or when it's counterfeited by things
in our culture that have no trustworthy essence and yet are posed as sources of light for example
we call famous people stars this is another one of these weird analogies that
it strikes me is unlikely to be entirely accidental if indeed anything can be entirely accidental
so we have all this phony brightness right including the electronic light stuff that
replaces or even like our electronic lights at night produce the pollution that hides the stars
of our sky there's a similar kind of pollution in the domain of relation where we would normally
be aware of and celebrate together and embody the invisible sun that is the source of relational and
original being
we've had many gray days lately and i think that's part of what led me to wonder about
what it would be like for a species like ours
to have had many gray eons yeah many gray millennia so many that first the light of origin
was obscured then it was hidden then it was lost completely then we made religions about it
then some of us went looking to see if it were still accessible to us and some of us found
paths back toward it and some of us found counterfeits and some of our cultures founded
counterfeits like the electronic light that isn't alive that is harmful to life
in most of its activities and results many of its origins
so i think
there's been bad weather for a long time in that space that separates
our souls and our hearts from their origin and so although we have many stories about
an invisible sun there very very few of us have had the opportunity to relate directly with it
though its existence is in some way certain because our desire for relation emanates from that
from that place and includes qualities of character and purpose and orientation
that we've inherited from because we can be said to emanate from this invisible sun
our souls our hearts and perhaps our minds and i wonder what would happen
i'm very curious i think it would probably be really confusing and terrifying at this point
which is maybe part of why it doesn't happen but if the clouds were suddenly depart and the
light of origin were commonly available to human experience again i'm very curious about what would
happen in that circumstance how the humans would respond and certainly you can you can tell kind
of what would happen just by watching what what human beings do en masse in the circumstance we
are in where it's hidden they make up stories about it they sell each other stories about it
one person lays claim to it oh i've seen the sun come follow me
me um but that sun belongs to everybody it's an essential aspect that the the invisible light
of being of origin the intelligence the beauty the love that are natural to us when the weather
is good when the when the light is is available to our experience they are always with us it's
just a question of can we sustain them together when times are difficult when the sun is hidden
when our people have forgotten it when instead they have stories and war religions and bizarre
fashionable metaphysics because trust me in the light of that sun in the light of origin
all of those things would melt away to nothing they would be obliterated by it
there would be no story capable of containing it or or even really pointing at it like
it is in fact transcendental it's beyond all conception it's beyond all stories
um at least my personal and admittedly limited experience of this topic strongly suggests suggests
that all of those things are true i saw on the way here a little girl with her father
i know their family and the brightness that was pouring out of that child
was really inspiring to me and profound and beautiful and made me realize there are places
in our experience where that light still shines
there's a helicopter very loud surprising how the noise of machines really dominates
a context a moment ago it was mostly birdsong now it's mostly engine
but the birdsong will prevail again
may you have a chance may you have the opportunity to discover whether there's something
to this conjecture i present you with today that there is an invisible sun or something even better
than a sun that it's more than simply a being that you have a direct and personal relationship
with it in fact it may be that your own mind and heart are expressions of it the way that color
is an expression of light in the environment i hope you may have the opportunity to discover
in your own way in a way that's true and unique and personal to you whether there's something
to this conjecture that we have shared today and i'm so grateful to have this chance to walk and
think and dream and reflect upon the beauty of the world that we live in the profundity of the
nature of light and time and reflections and spirits and hearts and minds bye bye for now
