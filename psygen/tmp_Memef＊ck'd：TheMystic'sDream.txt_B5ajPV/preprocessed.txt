How to dream on and off he hangs upon the grass on you
For there's a storm in an ancient sea so high
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night
The night, the night
The night, the night
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night, the night
The night, the night
The night
