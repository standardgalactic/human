briefly with narrative, personal identity, specific forms of memory, then we can begin
to develop the skills that will enable us to relate with narratives more intelligently,
to develop the faculties that we've thus far been denied, many of which would probably
appear to us, were we to see them in their raw human expression, they might appear supernatural,
they might appear like something from science fiction, but we are capable of far more than
anything that has ever been written.
And this is the fundamental message that I hope to share, is that it's not that we're
using one-tenth of our brain, if you used a hundred percent of your brain, your head
would probably melt, it's not that we're using ten percent of our brain, it's that we're
using three percent of the faculties that are native to our kind of animal, and that
percentage is catastrophically falling as our people progress technologically, right?
It's almost like we're investing in machines, the advancements that should have become,
no, analogs, actually crude analogs of the advancements, that should have become common
to human individuals and social groups, right?
And that's a tragedy I feel we must address, we must recognize, acknowledge, and address
together.
There is so much more I want to say about this, but I just feel grateful to have had
this opportunity to get this far today, together with you.
I would ask you to pay attention to the methods you use in your efforts to disambiguate phenomenon,
particularly your own identity, and to pay attention to the astonishing powers of dreaming,
to reambiguate relationships, identities, situations, and even objects.
I look forward to having more time together soon.
Thank you so much for joining me.
May you be well, may you be safe, and may we together recover some of the potentials
of the astonishing continuum of human intelligence.
Bye-bye for now.
