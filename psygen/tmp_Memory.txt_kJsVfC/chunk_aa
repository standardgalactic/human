Hello everybody. So once again I am at the San Francisco Botanical Gardens. I got here
today a little bit late because I was talking with a really interesting homeless guy who
is a painter and an actor outside the gardens and when I got to the gardens they were already
closed for what they call a solstice lantern walk which we may be encountering people from
so they wouldn't let me in the gardens but I know a lot about the gardens
so I'm in the gardens even though I was late and today
the winter solstice the long darkness but also
so a midpoint a between point an important between point in the time cycles
of earth and her relationships with other celestial bodies particularly the sun
and I'm going eventually today to be talking about memory
and one thing we can probably easily understand about all of the incredible
profound beauty of the living world is that all living beings can be conceived of
as a form of physical memory now of course there's there's much more going on than merely
recording all of these beings are sharing in each other's experiences and presence origin
all of these beautiful beings on earth the insects the animals the water beings the sky beings
the tiny organisms that comprise animals and plants
they're all together comprising a unity and I don't want to compare that unity to a brain
because I think that's an insufficient comparison
but memory is very magical stuff and indeed without what we refer to as memory
we would not have minds we certainly would not have language
and this looks to me like a like a coyote dig probably something else might have dug this hole
conceivably a raccoon or a skunk but I think it was a coyote
in order to think that I have to refer back to all kinds of previous experiences in fact
I have to be able to formulate concepts and ideas in language which means that I have to remember
all of the ways in which that that is done and I have to remember
how that whole process originated in my life
so I will be talking today about memory
but I just want to touch briefly on the idea that the living forms
are while they are like memory in some ways they are more much more than memory
they are meta memory yeah they're a kind of superposition over memory that is itself alive
now all of these words are quite suspect
they are attempts to capture qualities
relationships forms ideas senses of things our words and so they fall far short
of direct experience in relation they are toys and too often we take the words to so seriously
that we become blind to that toward which they point
yet we have the capacity to become aware of that and to unlearn it
yeah we can become aware of the strange obstacle our words and our names
comprise for us
and with that awareness we can see through it
perhaps into the essence and origin of beings and minds and the universe
and I know that this is possible because I have had this experience
so it's not merely a theory that I have
these living forms
are like the physical meta memory of the living earth
if she has something more than a mind and I believe this to be so because again I have experienced it
and
these are the organs of her mind and when they prosper she prospers and when they suffer she
suffers and when they die she forgets perhaps forever and the earth has suffered many extinction
events in which nearly all the complex organisms suddenly unexpectedly perished
and for a being a superorganism or a being that is a world
which I think we need a class in our language that is above beings ordinarily this is occupied
by the divine beings or by gods but we need a word in English that points at meta beings
and I think the earth and the sun and the moon and the planets these are
likely to be meta beings particularly though I would include the sun and the earth
though I suspect that all of the phenomenon in space time have such qualities
so the earth must have suffered extinction events and when she did
if indeed time is linear the way that we think about it
and I have good reason to suspect it is not I suspect that time is non-linear and our
relationship with it imposes linearity on our perception of time
but in the human ideas about linear time and given what we what we've learned from
paleontology and science and geology the earth has suffered extinction events
and for her those events must have been like strokes
one moment she had an unimaginably sophisticated mind trillions of diverse organisms
in astonishing symbiotic relationships the next moment nothing
and I wonder if in those moments what was left of her called out to her relations for help
just as I might call out for help if I could muster the
ability if I were badly injured or if I had a stroke but was still conscious
so
if the living forms are analogous but meta to the mind of this world
then when they are obliterated or replaced by machines her mind disappears
and I think our minds are children of these phenomenon
though we participate in them and perhaps represent a peculiar feature of earth's
cognition
a peculiar organ in the more than a mind that the living world
is the evidence of the can be understood to be the evidence of the existence of
and so these living forms we see
are memory but they are not merely storage they are memory come to life
and we moderns are unfortunate as it as relates to our understandings of memory because
the metaphors that we were that have replaced what once may have been our understanding of memory
those metaphors are mechanical and the analogy the modern analogy of memory
is what we do inside computer chips and storage devices and things like that so
we've come to associate memory with merely with mere storage
and that is not the nature of memory at all
for silicon does not dream and if you do not dream your memory is damaged
and may even collapse in fact studies demonstrated that
in animals that were kept from dreaming
uh first of all learning declined precipitously their capacity to learn declined catastrophically
but then over a very short period of time I think five seven days of no dreaming
uh and I guess researchers who can be very cruel to living things
um found a way to always interrupt the dreaming of the test organisms
those organisms lost the capacity to control their body temperature and died
silicon doesn't die if it doesn't dream because it wasn't alive to begin with
and it doesn't there are no minds in silicon let's be clear about this
these analogies that we make between the brain and the computer are nonsensical
they're they're simply wrong it doesn't mean that we can't
that there's no useful uh purpose in analogizing certain activities with computation
for example um I can perform with my mind uh one of the things I can do is is mathematics
I can do mathematical operations I can add to integers and get a sum
but that is not computation computation is a derivation of the of the ability of a mind
to engage in mathematical activity but no mind that ever existed
when it did mathematical activity did only that right a mind was a very complex thing
some small aspect of the mind engaged in mathematical activity
and so minds even when they are performing computations
are superpositions of computation right they are vastly beyond mere computation even when
they're doing that and they have to be in order to do that and bizarrely this was kind of proven by
Einstein's one of Einstein's best friends perhaps his his best friend Kurt GÃ¶del
in his uh theorems on incompleteness on the incompleteness of formal systems
and without going into too much detail for formal systems to be accurate they have to be incomplete
if they are perfectly complete they will fail to produce reliable results
and one of the conjectures about that theory is that this is because
for theories to work at all there have to be minds interpreting them right and you cannot
put the mind in the math the math can happen in the mind but the mind cannot happen in the math
now here is something that I saw a few days ago
and filmed in a previous video it now looks rather benign but it is the regurgitated
remnants of an organism
that was probably being digested by a coyote because it's hard for me to imagine
another animal who could have swallowed something that size
now memory is deeply mysterious and we will never understand everything about it
because of course our understanding itself relies upon memory to to assemble form and
and analogy and structure and and often humans understand things by analogizing to another
thing which is already understood and this creates a tree-like structure
that has very profound roots there are root elements to human cognition
so far as I know these have remained largely undiscovered and undiscussed
I call them holophores
to understand what anything is you have to have some idea what the world is
right that's that's a holophore the world or what reality is what everything is right
that's another root element to understand what a tree is you first must understand the context in
from which you distinguish a tree and the tree inherits qualities from that context
so in human knowledge and ideas we have these root elements that I like to think
well I discovered them for myself perhaps others have discovered them I am unaware of them if so
it seems at least modestly likely that others others have
have realized they exist these holophores these roots without which human knowledge cannot exist
and upon which it depends and upon which its character and and content depend
because all of the things that we distinguish inherit qualities
from our idea of what everything is so for example
if the physicists think that everything is the result of the big bang
then the universe to them takes on that likeness and all of the phenomenon within it
acquire inherit characteristics from that origin event and if the christians think
this is a world created by god then everything within the world inherits this quality
whatever you think the everything is will determine qualities and characteristics of all of the sub
derivations right all of the things you distinguish
and language is particularly strange in this way and quite astonishing
and of course to use language at all we must awaken our memories
and part of the reason why I am speaking on memory today is because I had a peculiar I'm
first of all I'm really fascinated with two two features of my experience as a living being
I mean I'm fascinated with thousands of things but these two things
really astonish me one of them is that we have memory at all that we can remember anything
that memory exists and the other is that we dream
and today as I was walking and thinking about the solstice on my way to the gardens I
I was trying to remember
what my friend told me they call the sun in blackfoot and I knew the second word
if I got it right but I could not remember the first word which mean which I think means
something similar to old man
and while I was unable to remember that first word and while I was searching for it in my
while I was striving in my memory to recall it
I suddenly realized that while I was walking down the street struggling to remember something
I felt as if I might be dreaming
and then suddenly I had this insight that
perhaps what we call formal memory
requires that we dream to assemble and sustain it
and thus memory could be understood
as the skeletal remains of activities performed by the dreaming mind both while we sleep
and in a variety of perhaps unique forms while we are awake
and this idea deeply fascinates me because dreaming and memory are unimaginably mysterious
and profound why should it be that each night when we sleep worlds appear within our minds and we
have experiences possible and impossible
profound experiences that have dimensions of meaning that it is
extremely uncommon our waking experience can approach
so that the activities of our minds in dreaming
have what I would
suggest our extra dimensions of meaning that our ordinary waking experience does not usually have
some of us have had daydreams and perhaps some few of us have actually dreamed while awake
some of those of us who profess to have experienced psychic phenomenon
will be likely to if you fast may tell us that the faculties they are familiar with in dreaming
are involved in their experience of non-ordinary cognition or non-local cognition
we do not have to believe any story about psychism or they're not being psychism
there are non-ordinary features of human cognition where minds link
and ordinary boundaries are crossed by our consciousness
we don't have to believe any specific description to understand that these things happen
nor do we have to disbelieve any specific description consciousness is still very mysterious
and our capacity to explore it with it because that's what you have to do if you want to explore
consciousness you've got to use consciousness to explore consciousness you know it's relatively
hard to see your eye with your eye and we have the same kind of problem with consciousness
and perhaps also with memory and with dreaming
now
people's ability to remember dreams varies widely and it may vary throughout their lifetime
some people remember dreams very easily others almost never remember them
some can remember many dreams throughout a night others only a few this may differ from
night to night or age to age or season to season but the relationship between dreaming and memory
is fundamentally profound and i think
that i noticed accidentally something today that very much surprised me
that when i was in the experience of not being able to remember a word and i was searching for
that word in my mind suddenly i felt this is like i am dreaming this searching in my memory
reminds me of dreaming
and i would ask that you recall earlier in my exploration in my reflections today
that i mentioned that even in science we have discovered an extremely
profound link between the necessity of dreaming and the maintenance of memory
now certainly without memory we have no identity
so you would still have a biological identity if you had no mind and no memory
but you would have no conscious identity so that who you are and how you think and feel and see
