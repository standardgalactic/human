and and remember your life and the world by the way these are salvia plants and you can
take one of these and pull it from the little sheaf yeah and if you just put this part in
your mouth and suck on this nectar will come out which i'm going to do right now
oh my goodness that one that one had a lot of nectar in it and one might imagine that that
nectar and that all of this biological phenomenon around me all of these beings and their relationships
that nectar is the memory
of both sunlight and darkness
well we could say we could say many things about what it is the memory of it is not merely these
two things for example it is the these are these organisms remember
and represent the origin and potential of life on earth the entire history of life on earth from
the first moment that life either landed or emerged on this planet or arose here to now
all of these living things are the children of that first instant they are its living memory
now as i was saying if you
if you were to be without memory you would be without identity your identity as a consciousness
would disappear now i wonder if any of you have had the waking experience
of the disappearance of your identity or some other experience of the disappearance of your
identity even momentarily i have had this experience in a couple of different versions
one of them happened in a unexpected shift in consciousness that happened when i closed my
eyes as a teenager and i forgot what everything was suddenly i could hear voices around me but
i could not understand them i did not know where or what i was suddenly for a moment my memory
changed its nature and i could no longer interpret sensory phenomenon the way that i ordinarily do
another experience where i lost my identity was during an event that we refer to as sleep
paralysis and after having experienced this extremely troubling and strange phenomenon
i became profoundly curious about it and i decided that the next time that it would happen
i would not fight it i would i would release myself into it even though it feels like one will die
and when i did which wasn't very long after making that decision maybe a few a month or so later
i awoke so to speak paralyzed blind and unable to breathe
i decided to let go
and when i did that something inexplicable happened
i seemed my consciousness seemed to rise up out of my body through the top of my head
and become a completely other kind of thing which was a which this is extremely difficult to
describe in language but it was like i was a an invisible snake like being in a black expanse
i was moving sinuously like a snake moves that movement was ecstasy and it felt
all these things it was at first of all it was impossible to think in that state there was no
thinking and there was no memory of humanity or language or darin or anything like that in that
state none i had no no relationship whatsoever with any previous identity or knowledge or memory
i might have had instead what i had was this ecstatic capacity to move and it seemed as though
because i moved this way all movement was it seemed as though this moving i became was the
cause of all movement and it was like being a god it was like being the god of movement
but there wasn't anything to remember and it was an ecstatic feeling it became more ecstatic
each time i moved or as i moved as i swayed but i had no body there was nothing to see there was
no temperature there were no other beings there were no ideas there was just this ecstatic movement
and memory was gone and then a short time later i returned to my it seemed that i i fell or
was drawn back from this possible superposition over consciousness back into my body and my
identity and i was astonished but for a time i had been without i had been i'd had awareness
of some form but without memory and thus without identity and also without ideas without language
without knowledge and language and knowledge and ideas and concepts and models and descriptions
and explanations these are all the structured children of memory
and perhaps memory
you can imagine if a wave
arriving on a beach as it departs left like a venous structure
huh the water is formless but its departure creates a structure and this may be one way to imagine
the relationship with or between dreaming as the wave and memory as the structure that remains
in the wake of its departing which we actually call awakening
awakening i'm gonna pause for a moment to read a comment by tim
he speaks of
remembering the arrival quote unquote of an understanding of identity
when it clarified that he was tim around age four
and i think it's really fascinating and important that we recall the peculiar
cognitive and imaginal adventures the cognitive and imaginal adventures of our childhood
because when we were children we had not yet developed the highly structured
forms of memory ideation cognition and language that that we may acquire as adults
and so as children i think we were creatures of the dream and i believe like fish swimming in water
if water is the dreaming we were
what we refer to as the imagination of children
is actually their capacity to experience the dreaming mind while awake and this
we can see the evidence of in their in their speech and in their play
yeah they can still dream while awake but as we grow older most of us our minds become
too structured to freely allow that and so perhaps we chase it yeah in some way
we we want to recover that feeling of dreaming while awake while we're awake that feeling of playful
creative relation with possibility and sensation and the mind consciousness
so perhaps we may take drugs unfortunately i think generally unfortunately
for there are other better ways to bring dreaming to life while we are awake
and the drugs mostly have profound costs now of course
i'm sure many of the the people who will watch this video have either
considered taking psychedelics or have taken psychedelics a particular class of drug
that induces profound non-ordinary experiences of consciousness and many people
advocate the use of these drugs and some people present them as a portal
to awakening or enlightenment my personal perspective is that this is very dangerous
additionally having known hundreds of people who've done psychedelic drugs
i've known approximately zero who actually experienced some kind of significant awakening
and i've known a good 10 or 15 people who've had extremely severe bad outcomes from that
some of which were relatively permanent
so i feel very cautious about
suggesting that psychedelic drugs are a way for adults to dream while awake
or to partly experience the return of the dreaming mind while awake
yet at the same time i would acknowledge there is some degree of similarity between
the experience of psychedelic drugs and the capacity to dream while awake a degree of similarity
and different drugs are different they're not all the same thing even though we refer to them
as a class but i have had experiences of dreaming while awake two in particular
that really stand out as an adult one of them was an accident that occurred
during a hypnotic experiment with another person
and the result of that accident was that while i was awake i was having
three to four well three to seven maybe dreams per minute that would just suddenly emerge into
my consciousness fully formed but not tagged as a dream tagged as an experience i'd actually had
just as if i'd you know tried to remember holding my phone and making this video
so dreams were bubbling up while i was conscious fully formed i didn't have to
i did not have to go from the beginning of the dream to the end they they arrived fully formed
and yet appeared to have a a unique form of temporality associated with them
and this was a staggeringly shocking experience for me and actually terrifying
because i was afraid that i might have broken my mind i did not know whether this phenomenon
would ever stop and one thing i regret about it is that i did not record any of those dreams
because i was so astonished and unsettled by what was happening that it it didn't occur to me
that it would be really profound to have records of some of them so over the next maybe 48 hours i
experienced hundreds of dreams while i was awake and of course i fell asleep and had dreams while
i was asleep but i woke up and this was still going on and over about 48 hours that phenomenon
faded so i know that it is possible to create a state perhaps i'm using trance
where someone can dream while they are awake they can have both the the experience of being
conscious and in a in a specific place and also at that same time be dreaming and those
dreams will bubble up like fully formed worldlets in their consciousness and that was an amazing
experience that i'm really feel lucky to have had but i've had another experience of dreaming
while awake very recently where um i was visiting a friend uh in the mountains above San Bernardino
and i knew that i was going to a lake and i was very excited to get into that lake with my body
and the night before i'd had a fairly i'd had both a nightmare and a very profound dream
and the next day when i got into the lake fully awake as i recovered from the cold shock
i began two things happened at once i began dreaming while i was in the water but the dreaming was not
how to put it it was like the essence of dreaming rather than having a dream
yeah and simultaneously dreams that i'd had the previous night including the nightmare
and the profound dream and some other dreams i had not remembered began flowing into my consciousness
suddenly so i was having this really complex experience of of being in my waking mind
swimming in the water of a lake recalling the previous night's dreams as though they were
happening again and experiencing something like the essence of dreaming
and i was overjoyed i was so excited because i knew that by the way before i
got into the lake i took a more than a moment i took time to really connect with that place
and to give it my reverence and my respect this wasn't like a playtime activity of
oh i want to go swimming this was this was a sacred activity of
i want to meet the living waters of this place with reverence and awe i want to join with them
yeah
and there's a there's a wonderful analogy between lequescence between water and dreaming
i think perhaps our minds are the result of things that happened when we were children
where
we would have experiences in the daytime our memories were not yet fully structured
in fact there may have been a time when they were highly unstructured
we would dream at night the waters would come and in the daytime the waters would depart and
there'd be a little tiny piece of structure there and then we would dream again and the
waters would depart and the structure would have grown slightly but then someday there was a time
when the waters no longer came in the daytime at all they only came at night and during the daytime
mostly what we experienced was the structure and that would be identity that would be formal memory
that would be the kind of systematic cognition we're familiar with as adults
but i think i'd be remiss
if i did not at least introduce the impossibly sophisticated topic of imagination here
so in the word itself there is encoded
image making
imagi
which we could playfully dissect into i and maybe even i not just i darin but i
i the mage i right i the magician
and then the magician has the same you know phoneme right
it's very difficult to speak eloquently about imagination because again it's it's what
but without it there isn't anything you can't put language together you can't understand
words or concepts or even distinguish things without using both your memory and your imagination
and of course when we dream whatever it is we're pointing at with this word imagination and i think
it's very poorly defined at best because there's something profound that escapes all definitions
about memory and imagination and dreaming but when we're dreaming the imagination is free
of the constraints that being awake places on it and some of those constraints are physical
there's a trunk of nerves that is controlled by the left hemisphere which is generally associated
with the right side of the body and the left hemisphere is has a primary role in our understanding
and use of language concepts there's a trunk of nerves that that run from the left hemisphere
and control the the sort of flow of fuel to the right hemisphere and when we fall asleep
this lock slips away and when we awaken it is reforged and so it's as if while awake one one
way we might think of it perhaps it's too prosaic is that the left hemisphere while we are awake
uh takes the right hemisphere prisoner and it's like um if we imagine it this way if you choose to
it's a bit like the story the man in the iron mask where there's a bad king
who has a prisoner in the dungeon in an iron mask because that prisoner is his twin
and that prisoner would be a good king and was perhaps once a good king
um but now is trapped and when we are children both sovereigns exist while we are awake but
as we become adults as we grow up and for most of us there are and some of us are exceptional
and we manage to preserve some aspects of the dreaming twin in our waking consciousness
sometimes as play or creativity or humor sometimes as uh non-ordinary cognition
things we might conceive of as potentially psychic
although both hemispheres are involved in all activity and you know in nearly all of our activity
and you know although in neuroscience we look at the brain and see what lights up during certain
kinds of behaviors it's very important to understand that the brain is extremely sophisticated and in
order to produce the results the the capabilities that it that it demonstrates it's a dance not
just of activation but of inhibition in order for some experiences to be possible
we we don't merely energize some parts of the brain we have to turn off others
and this is probably why we very rarely dream while awake
now as i recall in greek mythology
nemosony
from which we get the word mnemonic
nemosony was the mother of the muses
and i do not remember all of the muses names or their domains of
primacy
i remember one of the names is terpsichore
but memory was the mother of the arts
of consciousness and some of the domains of primacy were things like epic poetry
lyric poetry music perhaps philosophy
arts of the imagination yeah nemosony or memory was the mother of the muses
and of course it should be obvious without memory you have nothing you have you cannot really you
can have awareness right but you can't have consciousness as we experience and understand
it you certainly cannot have language right you you would be unable to and there's and there's
so many different features of memory involved in the things that we take for granted like just
being like walking or understanding a sentence or composing a sentence right because we don't
have to just remember what words are we have to remember how to compose language right so memory
has all these astonishing little backwaters and features that we ordinarily are never inclined
to think of to remember
it's not surprising that the greeks deified memory
for without memory there is no culture
now in our modern time i think we have suffered a cataclysmic deprivation and impoverishment
because we now depend on devices to remember things for us
