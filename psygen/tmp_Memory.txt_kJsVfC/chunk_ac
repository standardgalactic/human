mansura sadhi at a printing house and i've always been fascinated by by different features
of memory and try to practice memory arts in various ways mansura had a peculiar capability
that he must have developed in his youth i don't think it came naturally to him
if he heard a phone number he remembered it so he did not need a phone book
right he could hear a phone number one time link it to the person that it belonged to
and remember it and i thought that was pretty amazing i don't know if he had a technique
some people who have astonishing memories utilize techniques and long ago there were
techniques like memory palaces where you would associate things you wanted to remember with
specific locations in a building or a place perhaps like this garden a place very familiar to one
and those techniques are fascinating and useful but we must imagine that before we had before we
could depend on technology to replace our own memories including the technology of writing
our minds and memories must have been astonishing or different
and it's in general like their capacities must have been profound and i try to be careful
for example not to use an online this thesaurus when i'm looking for a word
not to just google something which is such a strange thing to say
not to google something that i can recall with a bit of effort
i don't use the internet i you know the internet is is a sort of central repository of
dead memory right um whereas what exists in our minds is living memory and we should
distinguish very carefully between these two things
so i think us moderns are suffering and the children born over the past 15 or 20 years
many of them will never know what it means to develop a highly sophisticated memory
a relationship with their own memory i think i think it's being damaged by its replacement
which as i said is not alive it's not come to life
now the darkness here is coming
and some of you
who are not now listening are probably already dreaming
and the water of dreaming is flowing
into the rivers of memory restructuring washing inviting creating
there is something sacred and divine about all of these matters
when the brightness of the sun in the day stops declaring the identity and shape and color
of beings then the imagination comes forth to suggest and paint and play
and respond
to the events of the day the events of our lifetime
and perhaps the potentials of the future
i've deeply enjoyed this chance to reflect on memory and dreaming consciousness and imagination
with you and i want to return to the idea that the living world
and the living beings and places of the world
can be understood
as the living embodiments of the memory and origin of life and consciousness
not just on earth but in time space itself
and that fills me with awe and love and wonder and reverence and ecstasy and joy
i adore this living world
and i long to deeply understand our peculiar human
contribution
and ability
i wish you all a happy solstice night a joyful
coming time
but most of all i wish wonder in your memory in your dreaming in your relations
may life and time be kind and gentle with you
may your holidays bring you insight and joy
