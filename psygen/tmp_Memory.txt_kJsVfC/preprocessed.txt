Hello everybody. So once again I am at the San Francisco Botanical Gardens. I got here
today a little bit late because I was talking with a really interesting homeless guy who
is a painter and an actor outside the gardens and when I got to the gardens they were already
closed for what they call a solstice lantern walk which we may be encountering people from
so they wouldn't let me in the gardens but I know a lot about the gardens
so I'm in the gardens even though I was late and today
the winter solstice the long darkness but also
so a midpoint a between point an important between point in the time cycles
of earth and her relationships with other celestial bodies particularly the sun
and I'm going eventually today to be talking about memory
and one thing we can probably easily understand about all of the incredible
profound beauty of the living world is that all living beings can be conceived of
as a form of physical memory now of course there's there's much more going on than merely
recording all of these beings are sharing in each other's experiences and presence origin
all of these beautiful beings on earth the insects the animals the water beings the sky beings
the tiny organisms that comprise animals and plants
they're all together comprising a unity and I don't want to compare that unity to a brain
because I think that's an insufficient comparison
but memory is very magical stuff and indeed without what we refer to as memory
we would not have minds we certainly would not have language
and this looks to me like a like a coyote dig probably something else might have dug this hole
conceivably a raccoon or a skunk but I think it was a coyote
in order to think that I have to refer back to all kinds of previous experiences in fact
I have to be able to formulate concepts and ideas in language which means that I have to remember
all of the ways in which that that is done and I have to remember
how that whole process originated in my life
so I will be talking today about memory
but I just want to touch briefly on the idea that the living forms
are while they are like memory in some ways they are more much more than memory
they are meta memory yeah they're a kind of superposition over memory that is itself alive
now all of these words are quite suspect
they are attempts to capture qualities
relationships forms ideas senses of things our words and so they fall far short
of direct experience in relation they are toys and too often we take the words to so seriously
that we become blind to that toward which they point
yet we have the capacity to become aware of that and to unlearn it
yeah we can become aware of the strange obstacle our words and our names
comprise for us
and with that awareness we can see through it
perhaps into the essence and origin of beings and minds and the universe
and I know that this is possible because I have had this experience
so it's not merely a theory that I have
these living forms
are like the physical meta memory of the living earth
if she has something more than a mind and I believe this to be so because again I have experienced it
and
these are the organs of her mind and when they prosper she prospers and when they suffer she
suffers and when they die she forgets perhaps forever and the earth has suffered many extinction
events in which nearly all the complex organisms suddenly unexpectedly perished
and for a being a superorganism or a being that is a world
which I think we need a class in our language that is above beings ordinarily this is occupied
by the divine beings or by gods but we need a word in English that points at meta beings
and I think the earth and the sun and the moon and the planets these are
likely to be meta beings particularly though I would include the sun and the earth
though I suspect that all of the phenomenon in space time have such qualities
so the earth must have suffered extinction events and when she did
if indeed time is linear the way that we think about it
and I have good reason to suspect it is not I suspect that time is non-linear and our
relationship with it imposes linearity on our perception of time
but in the human ideas about linear time and given what we what we've learned from
paleontology and science and geology the earth has suffered extinction events
and for her those events must have been like strokes
one moment she had an unimaginably sophisticated mind trillions of diverse organisms
in astonishing symbiotic relationships the next moment nothing
and I wonder if in those moments what was left of her called out to her relations for help
just as I might call out for help if I could muster the
ability if I were badly injured or if I had a stroke but was still conscious
so
if the living forms are analogous but meta to the mind of this world
then when they are obliterated or replaced by machines her mind disappears
and I think our minds are children of these phenomenon
though we participate in them and perhaps represent a peculiar feature of earth's
cognition
a peculiar organ in the more than a mind that the living world
is the evidence of the can be understood to be the evidence of the existence of
and so these living forms we see
are memory but they are not merely storage they are memory come to life
and we moderns are unfortunate as it as relates to our understandings of memory because
the metaphors that we were that have replaced what once may have been our understanding of memory
those metaphors are mechanical and the analogy the modern analogy of memory
is what we do inside computer chips and storage devices and things like that so
we've come to associate memory with merely with mere storage
and that is not the nature of memory at all
for silicon does not dream and if you do not dream your memory is damaged
and may even collapse in fact studies demonstrated that
in animals that were kept from dreaming
uh first of all learning declined precipitously their capacity to learn declined catastrophically
but then over a very short period of time I think five seven days of no dreaming
uh and I guess researchers who can be very cruel to living things
um found a way to always interrupt the dreaming of the test organisms
those organisms lost the capacity to control their body temperature and died
silicon doesn't die if it doesn't dream because it wasn't alive to begin with
and it doesn't there are no minds in silicon let's be clear about this
these analogies that we make between the brain and the computer are nonsensical
they're they're simply wrong it doesn't mean that we can't
that there's no useful uh purpose in analogizing certain activities with computation
for example um I can perform with my mind uh one of the things I can do is is mathematics
I can do mathematical operations I can add to integers and get a sum
but that is not computation computation is a derivation of the of the ability of a mind
to engage in mathematical activity but no mind that ever existed
when it did mathematical activity did only that right a mind was a very complex thing
some small aspect of the mind engaged in mathematical activity
and so minds even when they are performing computations
are superpositions of computation right they are vastly beyond mere computation even when
they're doing that and they have to be in order to do that and bizarrely this was kind of proven by
Einstein's one of Einstein's best friends perhaps his his best friend Kurt GÃ¶del
in his uh theorems on incompleteness on the incompleteness of formal systems
and without going into too much detail for formal systems to be accurate they have to be incomplete
if they are perfectly complete they will fail to produce reliable results
and one of the conjectures about that theory is that this is because
for theories to work at all there have to be minds interpreting them right and you cannot
put the mind in the math the math can happen in the mind but the mind cannot happen in the math
now here is something that I saw a few days ago
and filmed in a previous video it now looks rather benign but it is the regurgitated
remnants of an organism
that was probably being digested by a coyote because it's hard for me to imagine
another animal who could have swallowed something that size
now memory is deeply mysterious and we will never understand everything about it
because of course our understanding itself relies upon memory to to assemble form and
and analogy and structure and and often humans understand things by analogizing to another
thing which is already understood and this creates a tree-like structure
that has very profound roots there are root elements to human cognition
so far as I know these have remained largely undiscovered and undiscussed
I call them holophores
to understand what anything is you have to have some idea what the world is
right that's that's a holophore the world or what reality is what everything is right
that's another root element to understand what a tree is you first must understand the context in
from which you distinguish a tree and the tree inherits qualities from that context
so in human knowledge and ideas we have these root elements that I like to think
well I discovered them for myself perhaps others have discovered them I am unaware of them if so
it seems at least modestly likely that others others have
have realized they exist these holophores these roots without which human knowledge cannot exist
and upon which it depends and upon which its character and and content depend
because all of the things that we distinguish inherit qualities
from our idea of what everything is so for example
if the physicists think that everything is the result of the big bang
then the universe to them takes on that likeness and all of the phenomenon within it
acquire inherit characteristics from that origin event and if the christians think
this is a world created by god then everything within the world inherits this quality
whatever you think the everything is will determine qualities and characteristics of all of the sub
derivations right all of the things you distinguish
and language is particularly strange in this way and quite astonishing
and of course to use language at all we must awaken our memories
and part of the reason why I am speaking on memory today is because I had a peculiar I'm
first of all I'm really fascinated with two two features of my experience as a living being
I mean I'm fascinated with thousands of things but these two things
really astonish me one of them is that we have memory at all that we can remember anything
that memory exists and the other is that we dream
and today as I was walking and thinking about the solstice on my way to the gardens I
I was trying to remember
what my friend told me they call the sun in blackfoot and I knew the second word
if I got it right but I could not remember the first word which mean which I think means
something similar to old man
and while I was unable to remember that first word and while I was searching for it in my
while I was striving in my memory to recall it
I suddenly realized that while I was walking down the street struggling to remember something
I felt as if I might be dreaming
and then suddenly I had this insight that
perhaps what we call formal memory
requires that we dream to assemble and sustain it
and thus memory could be understood
as the skeletal remains of activities performed by the dreaming mind both while we sleep
and in a variety of perhaps unique forms while we are awake
and this idea deeply fascinates me because dreaming and memory are unimaginably mysterious
and profound why should it be that each night when we sleep worlds appear within our minds and we
have experiences possible and impossible
profound experiences that have dimensions of meaning that it is
extremely uncommon our waking experience can approach
so that the activities of our minds in dreaming
have what I would
suggest our extra dimensions of meaning that our ordinary waking experience does not usually have
some of us have had daydreams and perhaps some few of us have actually dreamed while awake
some of those of us who profess to have experienced psychic phenomenon
will be likely to if you fast may tell us that the faculties they are familiar with in dreaming
are involved in their experience of non-ordinary cognition or non-local cognition
we do not have to believe any story about psychism or they're not being psychism
there are non-ordinary features of human cognition where minds link
and ordinary boundaries are crossed by our consciousness
we don't have to believe any specific description to understand that these things happen
nor do we have to disbelieve any specific description consciousness is still very mysterious
and our capacity to explore it with it because that's what you have to do if you want to explore
consciousness you've got to use consciousness to explore consciousness you know it's relatively
hard to see your eye with your eye and we have the same kind of problem with consciousness
and perhaps also with memory and with dreaming
now
people's ability to remember dreams varies widely and it may vary throughout their lifetime
some people remember dreams very easily others almost never remember them
some can remember many dreams throughout a night others only a few this may differ from
night to night or age to age or season to season but the relationship between dreaming and memory
is fundamentally profound and i think
that i noticed accidentally something today that very much surprised me
that when i was in the experience of not being able to remember a word and i was searching for
that word in my mind suddenly i felt this is like i am dreaming this searching in my memory
reminds me of dreaming
and i would ask that you recall earlier in my exploration in my reflections today
that i mentioned that even in science we have discovered an extremely
profound link between the necessity of dreaming and the maintenance of memory
now certainly without memory we have no identity
so you would still have a biological identity if you had no mind and no memory
but you would have no conscious identity so that who you are and how you think and feel and see
and and remember your life and the world by the way these are salvia plants and you can
take one of these and pull it from the little sheaf yeah and if you just put this part in
your mouth and suck on this nectar will come out which i'm going to do right now
oh my goodness that one that one had a lot of nectar in it and one might imagine that that
nectar and that all of this biological phenomenon around me all of these beings and their relationships
that nectar is the memory
of both sunlight and darkness
well we could say we could say many things about what it is the memory of it is not merely these
two things for example it is the these are these organisms remember
and represent the origin and potential of life on earth the entire history of life on earth from
the first moment that life either landed or emerged on this planet or arose here to now
all of these living things are the children of that first instant they are its living memory
now as i was saying if you
if you were to be without memory you would be without identity your identity as a consciousness
would disappear now i wonder if any of you have had the waking experience
of the disappearance of your identity or some other experience of the disappearance of your
identity even momentarily i have had this experience in a couple of different versions
one of them happened in a unexpected shift in consciousness that happened when i closed my
eyes as a teenager and i forgot what everything was suddenly i could hear voices around me but
i could not understand them i did not know where or what i was suddenly for a moment my memory
changed its nature and i could no longer interpret sensory phenomenon the way that i ordinarily do
another experience where i lost my identity was during an event that we refer to as sleep
paralysis and after having experienced this extremely troubling and strange phenomenon
i became profoundly curious about it and i decided that the next time that it would happen
i would not fight it i would i would release myself into it even though it feels like one will die
and when i did which wasn't very long after making that decision maybe a few a month or so later
i awoke so to speak paralyzed blind and unable to breathe
i decided to let go
and when i did that something inexplicable happened
i seemed my consciousness seemed to rise up out of my body through the top of my head
and become a completely other kind of thing which was a which this is extremely difficult to
describe in language but it was like i was a an invisible snake like being in a black expanse
i was moving sinuously like a snake moves that movement was ecstasy and it felt
all these things it was at first of all it was impossible to think in that state there was no
thinking and there was no memory of humanity or language or darin or anything like that in that
state none i had no no relationship whatsoever with any previous identity or knowledge or memory
i might have had instead what i had was this ecstatic capacity to move and it seemed as though
because i moved this way all movement was it seemed as though this moving i became was the
cause of all movement and it was like being a god it was like being the god of movement
but there wasn't anything to remember and it was an ecstatic feeling it became more ecstatic
each time i moved or as i moved as i swayed but i had no body there was nothing to see there was
no temperature there were no other beings there were no ideas there was just this ecstatic movement
and memory was gone and then a short time later i returned to my it seemed that i i fell or
was drawn back from this possible superposition over consciousness back into my body and my
identity and i was astonished but for a time i had been without i had been i'd had awareness
of some form but without memory and thus without identity and also without ideas without language
without knowledge and language and knowledge and ideas and concepts and models and descriptions
and explanations these are all the structured children of memory
and perhaps memory
you can imagine if a wave
arriving on a beach as it departs left like a venous structure
huh the water is formless but its departure creates a structure and this may be one way to imagine
the relationship with or between dreaming as the wave and memory as the structure that remains
in the wake of its departing which we actually call awakening
awakening i'm gonna pause for a moment to read a comment by tim
he speaks of
remembering the arrival quote unquote of an understanding of identity
when it clarified that he was tim around age four
and i think it's really fascinating and important that we recall the peculiar
cognitive and imaginal adventures the cognitive and imaginal adventures of our childhood
because when we were children we had not yet developed the highly structured
forms of memory ideation cognition and language that that we may acquire as adults
and so as children i think we were creatures of the dream and i believe like fish swimming in water
if water is the dreaming we were
what we refer to as the imagination of children
is actually their capacity to experience the dreaming mind while awake and this
we can see the evidence of in their in their speech and in their play
yeah they can still dream while awake but as we grow older most of us our minds become
too structured to freely allow that and so perhaps we chase it yeah in some way
we we want to recover that feeling of dreaming while awake while we're awake that feeling of playful
creative relation with possibility and sensation and the mind consciousness
so perhaps we may take drugs unfortunately i think generally unfortunately
for there are other better ways to bring dreaming to life while we are awake
and the drugs mostly have profound costs now of course
i'm sure many of the the people who will watch this video have either
considered taking psychedelics or have taken psychedelics a particular class of drug
that induces profound non-ordinary experiences of consciousness and many people
advocate the use of these drugs and some people present them as a portal
to awakening or enlightenment my personal perspective is that this is very dangerous
additionally having known hundreds of people who've done psychedelic drugs
i've known approximately zero who actually experienced some kind of significant awakening
and i've known a good 10 or 15 people who've had extremely severe bad outcomes from that
some of which were relatively permanent
so i feel very cautious about
suggesting that psychedelic drugs are a way for adults to dream while awake
or to partly experience the return of the dreaming mind while awake
yet at the same time i would acknowledge there is some degree of similarity between
the experience of psychedelic drugs and the capacity to dream while awake a degree of similarity
and different drugs are different they're not all the same thing even though we refer to them
as a class but i have had experiences of dreaming while awake two in particular
that really stand out as an adult one of them was an accident that occurred
during a hypnotic experiment with another person
and the result of that accident was that while i was awake i was having
three to four well three to seven maybe dreams per minute that would just suddenly emerge into
my consciousness fully formed but not tagged as a dream tagged as an experience i'd actually had
just as if i'd you know tried to remember holding my phone and making this video
so dreams were bubbling up while i was conscious fully formed i didn't have to
i did not have to go from the beginning of the dream to the end they they arrived fully formed
and yet appeared to have a a unique form of temporality associated with them
and this was a staggeringly shocking experience for me and actually terrifying
because i was afraid that i might have broken my mind i did not know whether this phenomenon
would ever stop and one thing i regret about it is that i did not record any of those dreams
because i was so astonished and unsettled by what was happening that it it didn't occur to me
that it would be really profound to have records of some of them so over the next maybe 48 hours i
experienced hundreds of dreams while i was awake and of course i fell asleep and had dreams while
i was asleep but i woke up and this was still going on and over about 48 hours that phenomenon
faded so i know that it is possible to create a state perhaps i'm using trance
where someone can dream while they are awake they can have both the the experience of being
conscious and in a in a specific place and also at that same time be dreaming and those
dreams will bubble up like fully formed worldlets in their consciousness and that was an amazing
experience that i'm really feel lucky to have had but i've had another experience of dreaming
while awake very recently where um i was visiting a friend uh in the mountains above San Bernardino
and i knew that i was going to a lake and i was very excited to get into that lake with my body
and the night before i'd had a fairly i'd had both a nightmare and a very profound dream
and the next day when i got into the lake fully awake as i recovered from the cold shock
i began two things happened at once i began dreaming while i was in the water but the dreaming was not
how to put it it was like the essence of dreaming rather than having a dream
yeah and simultaneously dreams that i'd had the previous night including the nightmare
and the profound dream and some other dreams i had not remembered began flowing into my consciousness
suddenly so i was having this really complex experience of of being in my waking mind
swimming in the water of a lake recalling the previous night's dreams as though they were
happening again and experiencing something like the essence of dreaming
and i was overjoyed i was so excited because i knew that by the way before i
got into the lake i took a more than a moment i took time to really connect with that place
and to give it my reverence and my respect this wasn't like a playtime activity of
oh i want to go swimming this was this was a sacred activity of
i want to meet the living waters of this place with reverence and awe i want to join with them
yeah
and there's a there's a wonderful analogy between lequescence between water and dreaming
i think perhaps our minds are the result of things that happened when we were children
where
we would have experiences in the daytime our memories were not yet fully structured
in fact there may have been a time when they were highly unstructured
we would dream at night the waters would come and in the daytime the waters would depart and
there'd be a little tiny piece of structure there and then we would dream again and the
waters would depart and the structure would have grown slightly but then someday there was a time
when the waters no longer came in the daytime at all they only came at night and during the daytime
mostly what we experienced was the structure and that would be identity that would be formal memory
that would be the kind of systematic cognition we're familiar with as adults
but i think i'd be remiss
if i did not at least introduce the impossibly sophisticated topic of imagination here
so in the word itself there is encoded
image making
imagi
which we could playfully dissect into i and maybe even i not just i darin but i
i the mage i right i the magician
and then the magician has the same you know phoneme right
it's very difficult to speak eloquently about imagination because again it's it's what
but without it there isn't anything you can't put language together you can't understand
words or concepts or even distinguish things without using both your memory and your imagination
and of course when we dream whatever it is we're pointing at with this word imagination and i think
it's very poorly defined at best because there's something profound that escapes all definitions
about memory and imagination and dreaming but when we're dreaming the imagination is free
of the constraints that being awake places on it and some of those constraints are physical
there's a trunk of nerves that is controlled by the left hemisphere which is generally associated
with the right side of the body and the left hemisphere is has a primary role in our understanding
and use of language concepts there's a trunk of nerves that that run from the left hemisphere
and control the the sort of flow of fuel to the right hemisphere and when we fall asleep
this lock slips away and when we awaken it is reforged and so it's as if while awake one one
way we might think of it perhaps it's too prosaic is that the left hemisphere while we are awake
uh takes the right hemisphere prisoner and it's like um if we imagine it this way if you choose to
it's a bit like the story the man in the iron mask where there's a bad king
who has a prisoner in the dungeon in an iron mask because that prisoner is his twin
and that prisoner would be a good king and was perhaps once a good king
um but now is trapped and when we are children both sovereigns exist while we are awake but
as we become adults as we grow up and for most of us there are and some of us are exceptional
and we manage to preserve some aspects of the dreaming twin in our waking consciousness
sometimes as play or creativity or humor sometimes as uh non-ordinary cognition
things we might conceive of as potentially psychic
although both hemispheres are involved in all activity and you know in nearly all of our activity
and you know although in neuroscience we look at the brain and see what lights up during certain
kinds of behaviors it's very important to understand that the brain is extremely sophisticated and in
order to produce the results the the capabilities that it that it demonstrates it's a dance not
just of activation but of inhibition in order for some experiences to be possible
we we don't merely energize some parts of the brain we have to turn off others
and this is probably why we very rarely dream while awake
now as i recall in greek mythology
nemosony
from which we get the word mnemonic
nemosony was the mother of the muses
and i do not remember all of the muses names or their domains of
primacy
i remember one of the names is terpsichore
but memory was the mother of the arts
of consciousness and some of the domains of primacy were things like epic poetry
lyric poetry music perhaps philosophy
arts of the imagination yeah nemosony or memory was the mother of the muses
and of course it should be obvious without memory you have nothing you have you cannot really you
can have awareness right but you can't have consciousness as we experience and understand
it you certainly cannot have language right you you would be unable to and there's and there's
so many different features of memory involved in the things that we take for granted like just
being like walking or understanding a sentence or composing a sentence right because we don't
have to just remember what words are we have to remember how to compose language right so memory
has all these astonishing little backwaters and features that we ordinarily are never inclined
to think of to remember
it's not surprising that the greeks deified memory
for without memory there is no culture
now in our modern time i think we have suffered a cataclysmic deprivation and impoverishment
because we now depend on devices to remember things for us
when i first came to the bay area i worked for a man
mansura sadhi at a printing house and i've always been fascinated by by different features
of memory and try to practice memory arts in various ways mansura had a peculiar capability
that he must have developed in his youth i don't think it came naturally to him
if he heard a phone number he remembered it so he did not need a phone book
right he could hear a phone number one time link it to the person that it belonged to
and remember it and i thought that was pretty amazing i don't know if he had a technique
some people who have astonishing memories utilize techniques and long ago there were
techniques like memory palaces where you would associate things you wanted to remember with
specific locations in a building or a place perhaps like this garden a place very familiar to one
and those techniques are fascinating and useful but we must imagine that before we had before we
could depend on technology to replace our own memories including the technology of writing
our minds and memories must have been astonishing or different
and it's in general like their capacities must have been profound and i try to be careful
for example not to use an online this thesaurus when i'm looking for a word
not to just google something which is such a strange thing to say
not to google something that i can recall with a bit of effort
i don't use the internet i you know the internet is is a sort of central repository of
dead memory right um whereas what exists in our minds is living memory and we should
distinguish very carefully between these two things
so i think us moderns are suffering and the children born over the past 15 or 20 years
many of them will never know what it means to develop a highly sophisticated memory
a relationship with their own memory i think i think it's being damaged by its replacement
which as i said is not alive it's not come to life
now the darkness here is coming
and some of you
who are not now listening are probably already dreaming
and the water of dreaming is flowing
into the rivers of memory restructuring washing inviting creating
there is something sacred and divine about all of these matters
when the brightness of the sun in the day stops declaring the identity and shape and color
of beings then the imagination comes forth to suggest and paint and play
and respond
to the events of the day the events of our lifetime
and perhaps the potentials of the future
i've deeply enjoyed this chance to reflect on memory and dreaming consciousness and imagination
with you and i want to return to the idea that the living world
and the living beings and places of the world
can be understood
as the living embodiments of the memory and origin of life and consciousness
not just on earth but in time space itself
and that fills me with awe and love and wonder and reverence and ecstasy and joy
i adore this living world
and i long to deeply understand our peculiar human
contribution
and ability
i wish you all a happy solstice night a joyful
coming time
but most of all i wish wonder in your memory in your dreaming in your relations
may life and time be kind and gentle with you
may your holidays bring you insight and joy
