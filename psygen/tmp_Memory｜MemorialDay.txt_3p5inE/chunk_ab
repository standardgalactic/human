and the people who sign up to defend their country
I can't say something universal about that
but what I know
is that many of those who initially made that choice became involved in a religion
and either the religion was that the united states is good and true and great
or it started out that way and they figured out something more like what was actually going on
which was that the united states is full of shit and is lying and is making war for money
and for profit and for other deadly ignorant reasons
and there might be some shreds of truth in both perspectives I don't know
but I'm more inclined to the second one because the world is too delicate for us to continue to
make war it has to have an end
I mean we must bring it to an end we have to stop making war and make something at least vaguely
resembling survivable societies and collectives and intelligences and if we're not making that
there's no possibility of justifying war there's no justification for that kind of idiocy it's insane
and people will say things like yeah people will say things they'll say things like well
we have to make war because if we don't the other people will and so yeah that means that all games
are dragged down to the worst common denominator of the crappiest game that someone at the table
is willing to play now all games will be dominated by that that's not fucking survivable that is
completely absolutely stupid
stupid
all right time for me to get off my little rage boat for a moment and come back to memory
so all of this that you see in the background here all these trees and plants the sky the stars the
earth all these creatures all these organisms and all their relationships they are forms of living
memory they are the body of nemosity and we are expressions of that body and that our capacity
to form minds depends intimately moment to moment second to second instant to instant
on the diverse health of all of these living beings and the living places
yeah and as those collapse our minds collapse with them because they are the origins of our
minds moment to moment not just in long-term cause effect cycles though that way too
so when i have the intention to celebrate today memory nemosity i'm celebrating all beings
all the living places the universe itself the origins of time space there's nothing that isn't
memory there's certainly nothing meaningful that isn't memory
all of our technologies are actually can be understood meaningfully as
um concretizations of memory right the forks and knives in our silverware drawers
those are concretizations of the history of humans eating food
so really there isn't anything that isn't memory and it's not at war with itself in case you can't
tell right this is not a fucking battlefield do you see things exploding and attacking each other
and going apeshit crazy for the dumbest reasons imaginable here no you don't and neither do i
look how peaceful this is
these seeds i touch
you can see all the pollen
the beautiful pollen the living dust
it's so soft it's a magical substance that pollen i promise you rich with memory
the stuff we call dna are genes which humans still have but the slightest of understandings of
this memory
so let us celebrate this faculty this meta faculty from which all other faculties emerge
in all of its forms and kinds not merely the kind that we have in our mind where we remember
thinking or seeing or learning something um something conscious something cognitive but
also the memory that our bodies are that the living beings are
if we have respect and reverence for this it will continue to teach us and we can grow together
inside the living little bubble that we have here on this planet for the moment
but as the people and the collectives are destroying the ecologies they're ripping
the anciently conserved structures of memory apart and they're replacing them with pieces of
machinery and toxicity and death
and there will be an end to this behavior it may not come today but there will be an end to this
behavior so today on memorial day i remember war
but not with reverence with disdain i remember memory i remember mothers fathers children
i remember the animals i remember the living places
i remember beauty and learning and unity and communion
with reverence and hope i remember love
thank you for joining me i look forward to seeing you again soon
