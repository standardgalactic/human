emerge from moment to moment there's a phase
in childhood and adolescence there are phases where the children in groups will make up words
to indicate not merely ideas that are missing from the lexicon but even
ideas that are too general and pliable flexible to always mean the same thing
I recall a specific situation
where some young women invented a nonsense word that they used under a wide array of various
conditions to playfully indicate the openness of their actual experience and playful relation
and not merely with situations that they encountered but with each other
I may be able to recall this term but at the moment I can't
add
sometimes and this is more common in adolescence
cohorts will develop something that resembles at least pieces of a private language
and I think this is much more intelligent than what we ordinarily do by collapsing into
the traditional models of thought identification reference and description
I want to highlight that I believe our species is in something resembling an interface
and we're about to face a vast array of devastating upheavals cataclysms and transformations
that partly result from our mechanical propensity to devastate the
anciently conserved ecologies and living places of earth the humans seem to think
that we are somehow outside of nature and safe
from the repercussions of the damage we there in inflict on moss
um this cannot be true fundamentally on earth one would be better off thinking as if there is
only a single animal here an only a single organism is a better word a meta organism
that is fundamentally unified at all in all times and places such that any egregious damage
to that organism's expressions affect all beings and not just in the present or the future but
even in the past because certainly um our behavior in the present transforms the meaning of all
situations in previous time on earth I often give the example that if the humans speaking of them
as a generalized cohort if they do something so incredibly beautiful and heroic and intelligent
together that changes the meaning of sufferings that previously occurred
including wars and devastation if we are capable and we are of doing something so
astonishing so beautiful so intelligent that the entire history of life on earth would be in favor
of it then we have truly changed the meaning of being human similarly the opposite is true
if we do something so egregious and harmful so violating of the spirit of life on earth
that similarly changes the meaning of the past and the sacrifices that therein were made
in the hope of preserving life on earth and a future for all beings here
so this again violates our common ideas right we think oh it's always the same thing to be human
no it isn't what being human means depends on how we enact our humanity and also how we fail to
enact it how we discover it and embody the potentials native to our species or distort warp destroy
or or mutilate them
I will keep ringing the spell throughout this talk the bell of we are no longer humans
we have become something else and we need to recognize this formally in our thought language
and experience because something so fundamental has changed that whatever it once meant to be human
it largely no longer does
and so I would ask that together we recognize this deceptive normalization
over time in language and not merely resist it but step beyond it because if we can't do that
we're going to be thinking in ways about identity our natures meaning value and so on
that are archaic in a very dangerous library of ways
we will also be incapable of modulating our priorities because we will presume that the
priorities are the same as they have always been and one of the most egregious lies
in our common thought about nature is that the goal of nature is survival
and this is a myth imported and distorted from the discoveries of evolutionary biology
that didn't begin with Darwin but began their formalization perhaps and their dissemination
with Darwin and unfortunately as many of us are aware these ideas were captured in a sense
by industrial commodity-based cultures so that a vast array of deceptions resulted
the goal of life first of all is myriad or myriad features of goal like
aspects of organisms and ecologies and survival is not the pinnacle
it's very blatantly obvious that we would be better to select the pinnacle of symbiotic
relation right togetherness we live or die together and there are many features of the
idea of survival of the fittest that are simply wrong even though that principle can be evidenced
if we modulate our perspective and intentions
the principle isn't to be entirely discarded but it should definitely be
depresidenced right in our thought
the idea of survival of the fittest is an idea based on the primacy of the individual
and of course we have models that include cohorts
but the myth of the individual is one of the devastating
fictions that we moderns labor under the delusion of
there are no individuals there never were it's a conceptual fiction
that arises from peculiar properties of purposive
distortion and behavior in human cultures
there's no such thing as an individual because every individual is intimately dependent
on billions of other life forms the entire history of life on earth and indeed the future of life
on the nature of time in the biosphere and the transformations of temporalities that occur
beyond the purview of our common thought and conception of identity
time turns out to be the fundamental
a fundamentally crucial element in conception that is mostly discarded right all of the
enlightenment traditions see ask us to look with eyes that see transformation in precedence to
stability but our language and common thought habits of thought do the opposite they project
stability over time in identity and this deception deprives us of most of the possibilities of
actual insight or intelligence so this is another feature we must learn to introduce we must see
the transformation as having precedence due to the nature of time rather than the stability
now the stability is comforting because it offloads ambiguity and the necessities of vigilance
and this is a feature of modern human activity that is very
trenchant and widespread and deeply affecting of our capacities for cognition and particularly group
cognition everything that is arises transforms and departs
right nothing is stable though in a temporal map some features have greater stability than others
cities tend to outlast persons the constructs of the humans are an attempt to achieve a kind of
bizarre and usually dead inside immortality in the sense of persisting in similar structure
over time and this imperative arises in our language because it has the property of reducing
ambiguity and thus reducing vigilance and thus increasing the simplicity and accuracy of predictions
these three features of human concern vigilance ambiguity and prediction
can be found at the root of most of the problems that we're facing
so if we can transform our relationships with them we have the opportunity to become insightful
and intelligent together and to enact the potentials of our humanity that have long
lane dormant
so in closing I just ask us to remember that the reference that our words point at change
and sometimes they change so dramatically that we really need to think in new terms and ways
and maybe even new language whatever it means to be human today is not what it meant 20 years ago
or 50 or 100 and it might be so radically different that we're actually no longer human
we are something else and what that is remains to be determined not merely in thought but by
our behavior and our sensitivity to the transformations in the world and our cultures
and our behaviors that modernity is constantly raining down into us
