Hello everybody welcome. I'm out for a late night walk it's about 2.40 in the
morning and I woke and couldn't get back to sleep so I thought I'd go for a
wander. It's been raining here and it's quite chilly out and brisk and crisp
and silent in the neighborhood where I walk and one of the things on my mind at
the moment which has come up again and again lately is a particular quality of
the deceptive stability and uniformness of identity in language and part of why
this is highlighted for me at the moment is because language inclines us to
believe that we know what things and beings and situations are because we
have words for them and this is fundamentally untrue so that I've
often in my videos spoken of the necessity of thinking about identity in a
topological fashion so that we have for any given identity whether it's a simple
word like world or tree or human food or dream or awake the language flattens the
actual diversity that is being pointed at and it flattens it in the domain of
identity but also makes it point like in time so that it's not apparent in the
language that identity transforms over time and situationally in very dramatic
ways and these transformations are hidden from us in language in fact they are
awareness of them if not completely lost is profoundly inhibited
when I say we should think in a topological map about identity we should realize that
there are myriad endless in fact infinite modes of the experiential gestalt of a word
pointing at some experience for example food yes it's true that all apples seem
in thought to be quote the same thing unquote and they may match up to a degree
this is deceptive because not just because each apple is unique in each situation in
which we encounter an apple is unique but because we are unique the encounterer the
one the experiencer or the group is always not only profoundly unlike the declarative
features that come to mind when we use words it turns out that whatever an apple is in
experience depends fundamentally on who is experiencing it where under what
circumstances and so on and all of these features are effectively denied by language
particularly English there may be some now English supports the possibility of awareness of this
but very few people are concerned enough to pay attention to it and so we are largely put
to sleep right we are made into a kind of zombie mind by following along with oh I know what
that is therefore I can dismiss it or go to the next thing or whatever from my awareness when we
are truly present and awake each feature of experience the uniqueness and depth and infinite
relations that are arising in the moment become present in consciousness and available to
experience but our conceptual thought and our cultural thought emphasizes the pretense of
static identity over time situation and subject so a topological map when we think about
identity in this way we realize not only that there are mountains and valleys and that there
they have levels there are degrees of presence and departure from presence and awareness in
consciousness thought and speech but we realize that each instance of any phenomenon we might
refer to in language is profoundly unusual is non-ordinary fundamentally non-ordinary and
nothing like the point like dead sameness that we usually experience in thought and awareness when
we are thinking conceptually or when we're thinking linguistically or logically or rationally
and there's another problem which I've mentioned recently that has struck me very deeply of late
which is the problem of the inclination to dismiss descriptions and evocations of identity
situations cause meaning and so on that are untrue there's this bizarre gravity and really it's an
array of habits in modern thought and particularly this is more prevalent in males to believe in
the functional completeness of our declarations and models of meaning value identity and so on
that we determine to be untrue but it turns out that in order to have a resilient and creative
and intelligent mind we must be able to imagine situations which are formally untrue but give
us perspectives that are otherwise unavailable if we are discarding ideas and modes of awareness
and perspectives that have been determined to be formally false in some system of thought
one of the best examples is the concepts that are associated with astrology are very profound
in terms of what they bring into our awareness and consideration and it turns out that it doesn't
matter if astrology is true-ish or not and of course astrology isn't a fact because it's a creative
art of interpretive
interpretive schemas much like other divinatory arts such as the tarot or sororities
so it turns out that many of the ideas that we discard because they're untrue are extremely
valuable if one learned the concepts and lexicons of astrology resisting the urge to determine
whether they are true or not one is then capable of thinking thoughts that without those concepts
it is impossible or very unlikely to think for example that situations are the progeny of complex
relationships of influences over time and the temporal aspect turns out to be fundamentally
important especially when thinking of topologies because when thinking of topologies what we
want to think of is a moving topological map whose features are passing by or in time are passing
by like the line imagine the topological map that's being fed into a a slot and is emerging from a
slot so it's emerging in front of us from a slot and the topologies are passing toward us
and disappearing into a slot closer to us so you can imagine mountains valleys lakes rivers
oceans deserts and so on coming out of a slot in front of us traveling toward us and passing
into a slot near nearer to us and this model allows us to play in the identity landscape
of our considerations in a way that's much more similar to what happened in our minds
before we were fully in language and enculturated
the loss of this varied and always transforming landscape
perspective on identity is catastrophic to the possibilities of our humanity and intelligence
and so in anything we can do to restore the innate diversity of reference that's with a t s
things referred to conceptually or linguistically will radically improve our capacity for insight
which is the living origin that the relatively dead produce of quote knowledge unquote the
skeletal remains of insight the structured remains are the result of and certainly what we want is
insight novelty new features of thought awareness consideration and potentials for
relation and interaction and discovery even if those may be built on a foundation
that employs knowledge as one of its features
now i want to illustrate the concept
that i'm introducing here in a particular way
the concept that the belief that things that are named the same thing are essentially mostly always
the same and before i pick the specific referent that it's my intent to highlight here i just
want to mention that the idea of one day of life should be it should be immediately clear to us
that the degree to which this phrase points at the same thing is minimal
each day is preceded we would imagine by rest and upon awakening
we find ourselves actually in a new situation that resembles being reborn
the sameness of the days as they pass by which of course they don't actually pass by that's
just a linguistic trope is only really there in the sense of our habits of behavior and whether or
not we are creatively explorative or we are just semi-mechanically playing out
the roles and habits that are familiar or trenchant in our adult experience
if i use the word or the phrase a dream we think we know what this means
it means an experience that occurs in consciousness apparently while we are sleeping
it's very difficult to prove that a dream has taken place and it's very difficult to prove
that it is true that the dream has taken place or that the dream is a true experience
because it happens in a context of unconsciousness and is fundamentally
not directly examinable in any sense that science could get a hold of for example
and although science is a very valuable and dangerously important way of knowing
the vast dimensions of human thought consideration concern and experience that don't
fit in science resemble the vast dimensions of those features of life that don't fit in language
now the reference that i'm concerned with this evening
is the idea of being human
we think that being human is always the same thing this cannot be true
um conceptually most of us usually think that whatever happens at death is the same for everyone
whether there's nothing after death or or some kind of extended existence or some kind of
transformative experience or some recapitulation of previous experiences
we think that most of us most of the time are trained to think that even whether we know what
it is or not it's the same for everyone this cannot be true in the same way that we think
that being born as a human is the same thing for everyone it's blatantly obvious that this is
not the case and cannot ever be the case this propensity of language to normalize and collapse
the vast apologies of diverse natures characters potentials and experiences and reference is
devastating to human intelligence and it's something we must work together to overcome
if we are to have the opportunity to experience most of what it can actually mean to be human
because most of that is in the domain of potential not in the domain of expression
this normalization in language is devastating
and very compelling to a certain aspect or an array of the faculties
that the waking mind finds some sort of comfort in but that comfort
turns out to be a library of impoverishments
of course it's more comfortable to think we know what things beings and causes and situations
quote are unquote but in fact every moment of our experience is entirely novel and the portion
of it that fits in the normalization schemas of language and common modern thought
is so minute as to be trivial to a degree that is as I said before catastrophic
but one of the features that gets lost in our point like common thought and awareness
instead of a moving transforming topology
is time and there's lots of different ways that time is lost or discarded
but the point I want to make here is the idea that in different times and situations
what it means to be human is can be so different that the idea that we are still
regular normal humans becomes patently false
and it's my experience and thought that the present moment for humans on earth
and we should imagine this as still being unique in all situations people and locations
is fundamentally different from anything we've had modern experience of in our lifetimes
and what I mean by that
is that if we imagine time to be something resembling a river that we are traveling along
the features of the river for humans on earth circa 2023 are so different
from the landscape of thought and conception in which our ideas were developed
that we would be better off if we were capable of thinking of it
according to these transformations and in light of them rather than thinking of it
as an extension of all previous moments of humanity and concepts and language about being
human to such a degree to such an extreme degree this difference in the moment now
the character of time now the character of the situational topologies
that our humanity emerges from and is influenced and transformed by is so different right now
that we might be better off thinking oh my god we've become something that isn't human
right the degree of change is so dramatic that we would be better to think
we'd have we'd have more opportunities for insight learning and intelligence
if we were together thinking something so fundamental has changed
that we actually no longer know what it means to be human and in fact we aren't human anymore
we would need a placeholder for this new thing we have become
and then we would need to carefully over time connotate that placeholder
so that it had content in consciousness but I would like to suggest that the transformation
in time situation temporality and even biology that we presently experience
is so dramatic that we are no longer human we are something else
and it's very important to be able to think like this to know when an apple is no longer an apple
when the reference in the lexicon of English fail and are so
antiquated that they have are fundamentally just wrong right they no longer point
so we keep pointing in language at familiar features of experience and identities in the
same way we always did even when those
reference have transformed so dramatically that we would be better off inventing a new word
and new connotations and I think that's the situation that we're in as human beings at the
moment even though I still use the old word and I guess at this point I should do what I'm saying
and discard that word and invent a new one
if I were to do that
one of the words I might come up with or offer as a suggestion is somnions
we experience the great sleep of insight and presence to such a degree now
that the idea that we're awake when we're awake is wrong
it's not true
generally speaking if I generalize over the topology of human beings circa 2023
I would ask that we learn to notice when the nature of time and nature has transformed so
dramatically that the words and concepts we have traditionally used to refer to them have become
so hidebound that they no longer point in the right way at the referent that we expect them
to encompass and deliver to thought
it's my experience that something extremely dramatic yet invisible to common thought and
expectation is occurring and has occurred so that the ideas that we traditionally associate
with being human no only have a very modest
explanatory power in the current situation
now I wouldn't merely pick the somnions word and that word essentially means something like
sleepers or those who have become blind
because that's not the only important connotation of the present situation
in the past 200 years the humans have so transformed the context from which our humanity
draws its influences and articulations that whatever it used to mean to be human it mostly
no longer means new features for which we don't have language are emerging and being embodied
and expressed in individual human beings groups and societies nations corporations and so on
and we are disinclined to modify the language over time we keep supposing and we are trained
to do this inscripted we do this habitually but since we've always in modern times in English
called humans humans humans are still the same thing they've always been this cannot be true
and is less true now than it's ever been in any time of my life in a way we're kind of trapped
because we generally don't invent new language together when things transform
similarly we don't invent new concepts about identity right we're still using
um Aristotelian and Newtonian concepts of identity when at the very least we should be using
relativistic concepts we should have imported the central findings of relativity into our thought
and discussion and modeling of identity but this never happened it often takes hundreds
or even thousands of years before transformations in the fundamental
under structure of language and conception
emerge as transformations in common thought evaluation and discussion
and of course this is unfortunate
we are trained during our in-languaging and in-culturation to
subject consciousness to the structured conservations in language and conception
that are traditional but what we should be doing and what we must learn to do together
is the opposite of that we must learn to place our minds and conceptual faculties
and perspectivity above the models and language and concepts and to invent
together new language models and concepts that better preserves the transformations
over time and culture that we actually experience and that our minds and bodies
emerge from moment to moment there's a phase
in childhood and adolescence there are phases where the children in groups will make up words
to indicate not merely ideas that are missing from the lexicon but even
ideas that are too general and pliable flexible to always mean the same thing
I recall a specific situation
where some young women invented a nonsense word that they used under a wide array of various
conditions to playfully indicate the openness of their actual experience and playful relation
and not merely with situations that they encountered but with each other
I may be able to recall this term but at the moment I can't
add
sometimes and this is more common in adolescence
cohorts will develop something that resembles at least pieces of a private language
and I think this is much more intelligent than what we ordinarily do by collapsing into
the traditional models of thought identification reference and description
I want to highlight that I believe our species is in something resembling an interface
and we're about to face a vast array of devastating upheavals cataclysms and transformations
that partly result from our mechanical propensity to devastate the
anciently conserved ecologies and living places of earth the humans seem to think
that we are somehow outside of nature and safe
from the repercussions of the damage we there in inflict on moss
um this cannot be true fundamentally on earth one would be better off thinking as if there is
only a single animal here an only a single organism is a better word a meta organism
that is fundamentally unified at all in all times and places such that any egregious damage
to that organism's expressions affect all beings and not just in the present or the future but
even in the past because certainly um our behavior in the present transforms the meaning of all
situations in previous time on earth I often give the example that if the humans speaking of them
as a generalized cohort if they do something so incredibly beautiful and heroic and intelligent
together that changes the meaning of sufferings that previously occurred
including wars and devastation if we are capable and we are of doing something so
astonishing so beautiful so intelligent that the entire history of life on earth would be in favor
of it then we have truly changed the meaning of being human similarly the opposite is true
if we do something so egregious and harmful so violating of the spirit of life on earth
that similarly changes the meaning of the past and the sacrifices that therein were made
in the hope of preserving life on earth and a future for all beings here
so this again violates our common ideas right we think oh it's always the same thing to be human
no it isn't what being human means depends on how we enact our humanity and also how we fail to
enact it how we discover it and embody the potentials native to our species or distort warp destroy
or or mutilate them
I will keep ringing the spell throughout this talk the bell of we are no longer humans
we have become something else and we need to recognize this formally in our thought language
and experience because something so fundamental has changed that whatever it once meant to be human
it largely no longer does
and so I would ask that together we recognize this deceptive normalization
over time in language and not merely resist it but step beyond it because if we can't do that
we're going to be thinking in ways about identity our natures meaning value and so on
that are archaic in a very dangerous library of ways
we will also be incapable of modulating our priorities because we will presume that the
priorities are the same as they have always been and one of the most egregious lies
in our common thought about nature is that the goal of nature is survival
and this is a myth imported and distorted from the discoveries of evolutionary biology
that didn't begin with Darwin but began their formalization perhaps and their dissemination
with Darwin and unfortunately as many of us are aware these ideas were captured in a sense
by industrial commodity-based cultures so that a vast array of deceptions resulted
the goal of life first of all is myriad or myriad features of goal like
aspects of organisms and ecologies and survival is not the pinnacle
it's very blatantly obvious that we would be better to select the pinnacle of symbiotic
relation right togetherness we live or die together and there are many features of the
idea of survival of the fittest that are simply wrong even though that principle can be evidenced
if we modulate our perspective and intentions
the principle isn't to be entirely discarded but it should definitely be
depresidenced right in our thought
the idea of survival of the fittest is an idea based on the primacy of the individual
and of course we have models that include cohorts
but the myth of the individual is one of the devastating
fictions that we moderns labor under the delusion of
there are no individuals there never were it's a conceptual fiction
that arises from peculiar properties of purposive
distortion and behavior in human cultures
there's no such thing as an individual because every individual is intimately dependent
on billions of other life forms the entire history of life on earth and indeed the future of life
on the nature of time in the biosphere and the transformations of temporalities that occur
beyond the purview of our common thought and conception of identity
time turns out to be the fundamental
a fundamentally crucial element in conception that is mostly discarded right all of the
enlightenment traditions see ask us to look with eyes that see transformation in precedence to
stability but our language and common thought habits of thought do the opposite they project
stability over time in identity and this deception deprives us of most of the possibilities of
actual insight or intelligence so this is another feature we must learn to introduce we must see
the transformation as having precedence due to the nature of time rather than the stability
now the stability is comforting because it offloads ambiguity and the necessities of vigilance
and this is a feature of modern human activity that is very
trenchant and widespread and deeply affecting of our capacities for cognition and particularly group
cognition everything that is arises transforms and departs
right nothing is stable though in a temporal map some features have greater stability than others
cities tend to outlast persons the constructs of the humans are an attempt to achieve a kind of
bizarre and usually dead inside immortality in the sense of persisting in similar structure
over time and this imperative arises in our language because it has the property of reducing
ambiguity and thus reducing vigilance and thus increasing the simplicity and accuracy of predictions
these three features of human concern vigilance ambiguity and prediction
can be found at the root of most of the problems that we're facing
so if we can transform our relationships with them we have the opportunity to become insightful
and intelligent together and to enact the potentials of our humanity that have long
lane dormant
so in closing I just ask us to remember that the reference that our words point at change
and sometimes they change so dramatically that we really need to think in new terms and ways
and maybe even new language whatever it means to be human today is not what it meant 20 years ago
or 50 or 100 and it might be so radically different that we're actually no longer human
we are something else and what that is remains to be determined not merely in thought but by
our behavior and our sensitivity to the transformations in the world and our cultures
and our behaviors that modernity is constantly raining down into us
