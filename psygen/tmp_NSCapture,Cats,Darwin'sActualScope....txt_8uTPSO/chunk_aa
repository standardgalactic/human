hello everybody if I had realized that I might be motivated to make a
recording while I was out walking today I would have brought something to screen
the wind and usually a cotton ball or even some facial tissue wrapped around
the mic with a rubber band something like this it's enough it works it works
fine for my recording setup
yeah I'm not going to talk about that all right so what is on my mind first of
all I am where am I I am at a lake it is very windy and no shame for any of you
who decide this is too much wind noise for you but those of you who are bold
can accompany me in this strange adventure where I am risking my life
primarily from widowmaker tree falls to get a little exercise on Sunday in the
midst of some really interestingly stormy weather lots of wind gusts
occasional bouts of serious rain but not the long slow calm kind of rain that is
often well less threatening when the minute when the wind picks up the
primary threat seems to be trees falling and where I live there's a lot of sand
actually that's ridiculous let me be more clear as I understand it most of
Golden Gate Park is a giant sand dune with some complex aquifers underneath it
so I guess long ago the humans imported a bunch of topsoil so to speak and spread
it all around and one of my friends well actually no longer my friend what ex
communicated me for let's see I had a tiny bit of a sniffle and I was outside in
the gardens without a mask on or no I had a mask on actually but as I wasn't
severely quarantining I guess my friend decided I was a bad man turned out that
it was less than tiny allergies that I was experiencing not even a cold and I
certainly wasn't getting in anyone's face so yes she once remarked you know
there's so many non-native trees here and they just don't form deep roots and I
thought I mean especially now it's very obvious to me that she having the status that we would
associate with a person of color particularly whose ancestry comes from India might have
been making a psychological right right a displacement or a projection in metaphor
without knowing it because what I saw we see a lot of trees fall here in fact I'm
looking at five or six that fell recently right now yeah there's a bunch of them wow
I mean it's you know it's literally dangerous to be out in weather this windy the secondary
danger for pedestrians is stuff going in your eye or being impaled on your umbrella but anyway
back to the tree things so my friend who excommunicated me is a docent at the botanical
gardens I think still and I would be surprised if she did not understand that you're talking
about a maximum of two or three feet in most places of topsoil sometimes less and then just
saying right so trees fall over I don't think it's because they're non-native right they fall
over they don't form complex root systems not because they're not native but because it's
pretty hard to do in sand right so yeah part of the funny part of the the trail here has been
cordoned off yeah I guess there's also being hit in the head by things that fall that aren't
branches for example pine cones and stuff or little pieces of branches that could wipe you out as a
human it doesn't take a lot of weight coming from the sky you know 20 30 feet above your head to hurt
you or even kill you especially if you're not wearing a hard hat so yeah lots of risks what's
the f-side well a couple of things one who as one gets older you start to have to pick more or
less explicitly between something resembling more adventure or something resembling more safety and
the more safety line is devastating in a bunch of ways because although you could handle maybe you
could handle box life without too much trouble a while ago when you start getting older the comfort
of box life begins to become reticent of the comfort of the grave so to speak metaphorically and so
one necessarily chooses and it's a choice that you make each day now it's similar with our minds do
we adventure or do we stay in familiar terrain and why and what what turns out to happen is it's a
bit like exercise if you don't if you don't keep it up it tends to oh wow there's a little yeah
see I just saw a branch fall that could have definitely hurt someone thankfully it was
slowish oh wow I just heard another one yeah it's like I'm out here and it's it's like I'm
hearing gunshots right except they're not gunshots they're tree breaks so it's probably good that trail
was cordoned off because I might have been stupid enough to go up there and I can tell from here
basically it's a bunch of cypress trees and these things naturally produce I think it's mostly
cypress and they naturally produce these long slender branches that are prone especially when
water soaked to just snap off right it might be some kind of you know evolutionary benefit or
something maybe maybe those branches both fertilize the ground as they as they fall apart or bring
other organisms or root possibly or maybe there's no you know obvious benefit if we're doing what we
might imagine is Darwinian accounting which brings me to a variety of topics I've long held to switch
to the topic of house cats that house cats are basically they can be understood from a
variety of interesting perspectives including that they are effectively ambient psychedelic
organisms meaning that if you begin to bond your mind with the mind of a provocatively intelligent
house cat rather than a really lazy one but even the lazy ones or it's like they're smoking opium or
something all the time um or rather they don't need to smoke anything the Cheshire cat in Allison
Wonderland is sort of an example of someone who has noticed the strangeness of the cats but I have
long held that in terms of intelligence and non-human intelligence and alien like not alien is in bad
alien is in family member from another origin right more like that yeah the house cats those are
like the square root of an octopus is a house cat you know maybe if you you know house cat to the
second or third power equals praying mantis or something like this and you know you can flip it
around the the intelligence of the ambush predators is very unique and profound and the
intelligence of a house cat which is a really peculiar an animal with a very peculiar history
developmental history very peculiar and trippy because it goes from being a wild alpha predator to
being a half domesticated beta predator like you know delta predator or something that effectively
causes its primary symbiont right captures a food source in humans trippy right very strange very
unexpected from some perspectives now of course the natural contrast to a house cat is the dog
similar similar developmental history and look cats aren't not pack animals they just
you know lions at least have what we call prides in English groups and are there other examples I
don't know there are probably examples of couplings and friendships but not primary necessary groups I
just don't know enough about the feline animals to know but there's at least one example of where
they form you know cohorts and pods and I imagine young lions and perhaps mountain lions and so
forth may certainly when they're young right they travel and hunt and play with their siblings who
knows if there's inter inter family activity of that kind I was talking to my friend Jay the other
night actually was last night and we were talking about this this topic and I love to wax enthusiastic
about the intelligences of the ambush predators because they are in a sense
like if you want security and familiarity dogs work beautifully right those are the
solar animal essentially of the pair and look there are solar cats and there are lunar dogs but
fundamentally the dog is the solar animal daytime predator right although not entirely you got
coyotes and wolves that are nocturnal maybe I had that wrong actually nighttime predator nocturnal
and similarly cats also nocturnal but perhaps more so than dogs tend to sleep all day stay up all
night left to their own devices probably I don't know what they would do in their natural situations
because I don't see those animals in those situations but I do think of dogs as solar
not explicitly and not only and cats as now there's going to be some serious wind
so we were talking about this the other night and okay what was the topic all right the topic was
actually pretty deep it was a topic that I've spoken of some recently but even since then the
insight has been enriched it's the topic of what happens when something captures the nervous
system of an animal and there's lots of stuff that capture our nervous system a simple example
of this is that you know it's the Pavlovian thing right if we smell something delicious in fact I'm
just I'm merely thinking of something delicious and my mouth is starting to water but if I smell
something delicious much more so that's an example where you can see that I have no control I have
no mental control over gale force winds just short of hurricane speed I have no control over whether
my mouth waters or not that I know of might be able to influence it with NLP or hypnosis or
something but I have no my salvation and similarly if I hear one of those gunshot branch cracks and
it's loud enough and near enough probably y'all jump when you see corvids at least around here
approaching food on the ground they will often sort of hop toward it and leap backwards I was
thinking a lot about that particular behavior the other day after observing it because trying to
understand one thing I can imagine now which it didn't occur to me before I mean it's not crazy
it's natural it's just different from the very safe norm that usually applies and the difference is
profound enough that I am well aware I could be killed it's not very likely but it's probably 50
times more likely than it was yesterday alright so the thing that occurs to me now and I couldn't
figure it out before but now it seems relatively obvious snakes eat birds and one of the best ways
to catch bird would be to hang out near the corpse of an animal right you're an ambush
predator you have that that feline intelligence that praying mantis intelligence that octopus
intelligence the jumping spider intelligence right you have this trap setting capable capable of
intelligence praying mantis is straight upset traps on flowers right just no doubt about it you see
them do it all the time so I wouldn't ambush predators and since corvids eat meat they eat
other stuff too they eat seeds and bugs and worms and stuff it depends on the birds and where they
are since they eat meat what might happen is a snake might or other ambush predator possibly
not sure what a bobcat maybe what else would eat birds I don't think I mean coyotes eat birds but
they also eat dead things snakes don't usually I don't know of any snakes that eat corpses now
you can teach cage snakes to eat dead mice I don't know if they eat dead mice in the wild not
it seems pragmatically effective that they should I just don't know but yeah I can imagine snake
hangs out near bird food of any kind dead things seed piles you name it and just waits for birds
and waits close enough that when the bird gets to the food item it's within striking distance of
the snake so that would explain evolutionarily how the peck jump back like it's literally like that
that song that has the lyrics jump back jack in it the bird like goes forward and then leaves
backward it may do that a few times and after like two or three times it'll it may just fly off
and leave the food alone that does happen I've seen it but what's going on there isn't that the
bird is thinking I'm scared I think what's going on is that the bird's nervous system has been
captured by something like an evolutionarily developed and look the thing may not be genetic
there's got to be nine other ways of influencing organisms that aren't merely genes and most of
those ways might we would argue would necessarily have some effect on genomes because they they
become selection variables in that theory and we're gonna get some weird stuff about that in a
minute so they might have so they might have selective functions so to speak or effect
but yeah what I think is going on is that the organisms nervous system has been captured and
like a goose that sees a ball rolled a few feet from its nest during a certain season it will go
the goose will crane its neck at least this is what I've heard crane its neck from research
crane it's not go toward the ball and roll the ball back into the nest whether or not there's
a ball there anymore at all and you know so you can see that there are these protocols you know
in the age of computers we would be likely to call them programs because we're just reaching
around for some metaphor but it's a historically physically structured vulnerability to capture
when an organism detects high heat suddenly it recoils it may recoil from other things water
food that may not be safe or smells wrong you know one kid on the bus disgorges his breakfast on
the floor now you pretty soon have what a oh this could be good just siren we might get a
demonstration of this effect let's see yeah pretty soon you've got you know
sudden unexpected public vomitorium on the bus right because once two more kids
follow suit and they're certainly not doing that on purpose right they're not trying to do that
they don't want to do that they can't help it so we didn't get the example I wanted so um
you can see that there's a structured response that's probably ordinarily rather than being
activated we can think of it both ways and we probably should rather than being activated by
stimuli it could also just be ordinarily inhibited and under some circumstances that
inhibition collapses and the coyote howls in concert with the approach of a siren not because
it wants to not because I mean possibly it's in pain it is possible we don't know and it's
reasonable to imagine it might be when you present
wildly exaggerated stimuli to an extremely sensitive organisms
to a hypersensitive organism right if a wasp can detect one molecule of a substance within a
two-mile range within a two-mile circle as I understand it some wasps are capable of that
sensitivity if you subject them to for example some kind of human perfume laundry soap for
example laundry soap stench could be physically painful to them so we don't know whether the
siren is physically painful but we do know that it resembles other coyotes calling and so when
the dogs howl and the coyotes howl at the siren there's a good chance that they're just being
triggered right their body is howling not their mind and you know we hear people talk about sensory
experiences like the hair stood up on the back of my neck I got goosebumps and obviously goosebumps
are a thing that happens when we're cold too but there are certain physiological transformations
heart palpitates right we like I don't know if we like it I think we like it because we're
our most of our experience is kind of dead but we like horror movies sometimes or we may like
scary rides because they
deprive us of the control we might ordinarily have over our body's sensations or the selection of
sensations right actively selecting sensations and subject us to extraordinary forces and sensations
so we too can be triggered
it would be interesting to see the library of programs so to speak they're not actually programs
I don't think but to see like the library of a single creature now obviously if you observe a
single creature very closely over time and you observe many of them many of their kind quote
quote you will begin to understand something of the library
so praying mantises for example
will they have a complex striking
behavior it's a prey capture behavior but they can use it like a punch as well
well and they have a complex threat display where their body transforms you know into
a creature oriented to both fight and shock a possibly predatory animal creature
so we were talking about the peculiarities obviously right like social media is weaponizing
this against us it one could say it is studying in a sense human reactivity
and then producing hopeful monsters that capture it amplify it
and make it contagious that's one of the dumbest uses of technology that anyone could imagine
I mean it's almost as dumb as just throwing bricks at people's heads the problem here is
that they can't see the brick it has the same effect in that they get dumber every time they're
subjected to it most of them some of them have a good buffer some of the humans
but yeah they get dumber every time like every iteration makes them dumber and
and
the problem there is really dangerous because anything that reduces your awareness or sensitivity
over time is prone to create a situation where you can't you won't be able to perceive what you've
lost and this is part of the problem with ordinary human aging one might argue that social media
ages certain aspects of us precipitously and invisibly
since our bodies don't age in response though I think actually internally they do we don't notice
anything that affects the thing you notice with right creates a really good
a really effective process that hides its own it hides its own progress and it hides the damage
it does it naturally does this
so we want to have awareness when we approach technologies or media
we want to have awareness of what's getting compromised how quickly how deeply
uh and how can we if it if it becomes necessary for some reason that we interact with the technology
anyway or if we want to we want to have the intelligence necessary to make determinations
about what that curve of harm looks like to whatever degree we are able and then adjust our
