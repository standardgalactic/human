behavior accordingly so as to preserve the assets that would otherwise be lost
now you can see that the pros for example when they approach a food source on the ground
start to go at it and then jump back
they're testing to see if anything moves nearby the food during that process
and if it does they will become aware that the food is a trap
now obviously also once humans became tool makers of some kind they probably made bird traps too
of various kinds and so the bird is trying to check whether
you know probably a whether there's a organismal trap and b whether there's a physical trap even
though it may not its body probably isn't complexly differentiating between those two things
all right so triggering
I think even likely for an organism to take advantage of programs that are normally
let's not call them programs let's call them abilities
for or what do I want to call them
abilities
each organism seems to uniquely develop
of yeah this is this starts to run into problems between the difference between language and
description and what animals and organisms actually are and are doing or being
so imagine a broad spectrum of unique forms of sensitivity and or intelligence
that naturally result in
super effective like meta effective relational or physical
skills one can imagine that it might be possible for an organism to
especially for humans for example because we have a lot we have a great deal of luxury
compared to most animals in consciously determining our developmental spectrum spectra
so the humans we probably have access to at least probably thousands of
potentially developable abilities that result when enacted in something resembling either
relational or physical super function or both and one tends to lead to the other right because
for example
brilliant athletes who become known for their athleticism
acquire relational benefits what we call fame which radically increases
both their the opportunity space for reproduction but also for just enjoyment
unfortunately at the same time because of how strange the humans are in modernity and maybe
forever that will also attract enemies opponents undesirable possibly obsessive attention from
other humans and maybe under some circumstances from the sky itself
so my friend and I were talking about cats and she said something resembling you know
well i was talking about how cats can be triggered right if they
and that sometimes house cats dogs you can see dogs doing behaviors displaying
behaviors that and i guess i'm anthropomorphizing a bit that may be natural for humans or at
least some humans you know when a dog makes a silly mistake a silly physical mistake or like
it misses the bite or it slides chasing the ball it crashes into the wall or and by the way
that's you can see triggering right there because the dog ordinarily does not crash into things
but under circumstances where it becomes hyper focused on the ball it will crash in many dogs
will just crash into walls or other nearby objects
so
i have seen okay we're in gale force winskin dogs appear to exhibit emotions that resemble shame
and or embarrassment i'm granting that that's my interpretation
after after being witnessed
they seem to be aware of observation in a way not dissimilar to how we are
if i suddenly step on the side of my foot for example and begin to stumble because i missed that
the first problem is the pain in my ankle but the second problem is did anybody see me
you know i will quickly glance around to see if i have been seen to have failed at something
as simple as taking a step right
so i was i was explaining that it was my experience when i began to learn more about cats
because my girlfriend had a pair and certainly i encountered them many times before but i think
this pair of cats was the pair i was most intimate with him throughout my life
to memorialize them mexico and panther which who was her son
the mexico cat was a very hyper intelligent sensitive loving soft mother cat very fluffy
furry white found in the desert with a piece of her tail missing as a kitten i think if i remember
right and panther was one of her children big black fluffy cat and panther would when we were
playing occasionally and i've seen other cats do this very few of them won't be triggered if
you accept the gambit so this is this is a gambit in animal chess called cat belly when dogs give
you their belly it may or may not be submissive but it's they're they're showing their vulnerability
because their primary powers as an animal are
the primary powers are like a spear in a dog they lunge and penetrate
um the cat is different it can lunge but it normally attacks with paws because those are
razor sharp and grippy and once it gets a grip then it can penetrate usually the neck of a creature
often the neck with jaws both animals have bone breaking jaw power uh the cats is less
because it's smaller the house cat anyway um but what what she was saying i was saying that
basically sometimes i would pet panther and he would you know roll over on his back and this
seemed to be an invitation for you know some gentle aware belly petting um gentle and aware
both because you know this is an animal's vulnerable underside and previous experience
had taught me that under certain conditions cats become triggered and when they are triggered
they may bite unintentionally and usually they can manage the force so that it's not really bad
but still painful um and they also can uh there's some word for this it's not worry that's what a
dog does it's some kind of shredding thing they basically um grasp with their front paws and
may claw with them and then shred or gash with their rear paws and so what would happen is i'd
be petting panther we'd be having like a love session and you know he really he really enjoys
that but then sometimes he would get triggered and capture my hand bite it and try to rip out
it with his back claws and then he would he would sort of snap out of it and display signs of that
interpreted as sadness shame embarrassment i didn't mean to do that this kind of thing
and uh it took me a long time to understand what was going on i certainly didn't understand
to the degree that i you know in anything that resembles what i'm saying now i was unconsciously
aware but not cognitively and conceptually aware of what was going on i didn't have a model
but i did learn very quickly that when cats show you their belly it's either one of two
things usually going on either they really will enjoy the intimacy and danger of allowing
it effectively a god right an animal that is unimaginably powerful compared to you
you can kill a cat probably just by crushing its rib cage in your single in the grip of one hand
right you can kill it if you wanted to kill a cat hopefully you don't
it would take very little effort on your part to destroy the animal
physically and there's very little the cat could do about it so and the cat may not know
your physical strength but it probably suspects it from examining you
so when the cat rolls over either
it has learned to inhibit the triggering that is likely to happen when you approach its belly
with your hand and begin stroking it and so it just enjoys the ecstatic feeling
of being vulnerable like being loved where one is most vulnerable so to speak in human language
but other cats and again look the cat rolls over and displays its belly so something's
going on there but it's not necessarily my friend was saying a display of submission
or you know because when the cat is on its back all 20 of its face knife footraisers
are accessible and the bite and so now
it can grip with its fore paws bite
and shred with its hind legs
and this is a for for many animals I suspect this is a disemboweling move right it opens up
first of all just opens up gashes on the animal if you're a large cat
if you're a small cat it still messes them up
so yeah we had a big laugh because she was like the cat rolls over and people think it's a submission
move because they've been watching dogs or something it may or may not be partly submissive
but basically the cat now has full access to all of its weapons
it's almost like the cat is saying like the cat is daring you
right do you want to put your hand in the chainsaw
it's like a Tasmanian devil in Looney Tunes I just rips things apart
so I thought that was hilarious hilarious take on
on cats but if you want non-ordinary experience
if you're someone who seeks that the best place to seek it is in
a devoted contact with the living place with specific animals and birds
specific plants you know it doesn't matter whether plants have spirits or plants have minds
they are organisms and we are organisms and we are organisms from the same world
so in one set of categories that makes us the same thing the same being
we are that that tree is me outside my body I am the tree outside its trunk
and I'm not saying this is a fact but it is categorically true before even we are organisms
we are beings so it goes like the concentric circles go like mystery universe then beings
then organisms and earth organisms and then you know on down the line to animals human animals
and that's just what if what if our category tree is missing three important elements and I would
argue it is so that we can't even see them in language there's no way to detect them in concepts
because we have no placeholder for them in our categorical libraries
and I think actually this is a huge problem for all humans
but particularly for we who speak English because our category tree
is it's almost like it was hit by a shotgun or something it's missing big chunks of crucially
important placeholders shelves containers so forth that would draw our attention to modes of existence
that we no longer have a placeholder for and so since we don't most of those modes get
they get exported to the supernatural the psychic the superstitious the religious but
they shouldn't they don't need to be the actual situation is so weird that it's weirder than
all of supernatural speculation it's weirder than all religious speculation it's weirder than all of
science so none of those should become the authorities of identity those are conceptual
frameworks right you might argue one might reasonably argue that humans are particularly
vulnerable to structured reactions that are not necessarily physical but are similarly involuntary
and are conceptual right what would be an example well
well weirdly I was listening to the most enlightening podcast last night on I think a
philosopher called Dugan that it is in thought that it is thought or Durgan that it is thought
influenced influences Putin's policy dramatically
and for the first time I heard
powerful criticisms of the concept of liberal being liberal
so yes where was I going all right
examples of such cognitive traps are the Christian belief that everybody who doesn't accept Jesus
going to hell and that there's a Satan now
similarly the doctrinal liberal belief
once it becomes doctrine once you have to either be liberal or fascist
the liberal belief that you get to invent your identity you get to invent your gender
you are free to completely dispose of all conventions and anyone who doesn't dispose
of these conventions is evil particularly if they do not dispose of them in the way that you
dispose of them now you have sectarian liberality right and this can become extremely dangerous
virulent and compelling for humans we
adopt programs from not tradition but traditional language and the traditional
presuppositions about identity meaning and value also which games are played
that are imported when we learn a modern language particularly in my case I can speak
only telling me about English okay
so wow it's interesting
I've walked around the lake I think I'm on my
third circuit I'm sure you heard that sound that sound was the sound of a spear falling
from a cypress into the ground a foot from me it was pointed straight down it was pointy on the end
it stuck into the ground and it had a cone on it it was small but
uh had I been struck by that likely I'd have been injured possibly seriously
so it's probably time to stop the adventure but I'm not going to just yet because the sun has
come back out and there's a break in the rain and it's a good time to stretch my legs I think
of course I could walk in safer places
that startled me so I branched and thought
yes so the humans are vulnerable okay when we learn a language like English a bunch of games
are imported like courtroom mind or war mine or mine and yours or us and them
now us and them exist in most languages and conceptual frameworks
but the way the particular character of the English the modern the colonial the neo-colonial
the para-colonial you know what that is it's probably crashing it's tree branches snapping
yeah scary yeah be careful uh there I've seen branches fall on the path it's very very windy
it they can kill you I'm not saying don't walk I'm out here walking too but just be aware because
it is yeah yeah yeah but I almost got hit a moment ago by like a spear that stuck in the
ground and it was like a foot from me so be you know be aware those those cypresses they naturally
drop large branches so on that side you're at risk around this side not so much yeah okay my pleasure
yeah there were some gunshot branch cracks
all right I keep getting distracted but thanks for bearing with me those of you who have
hopefully I'll give you some uh some juicy morsels here um all right so
so
complex array of what I would call malware comes packaged with English and it's not
actually it's not in the language
per se the malware isn't necessarily in the language
the malware is packaged in metaphors models of identity meaning value relation function
um
efficacy and basically good and evil that come from the cultural or anti-cultural right the malware
traditions that
influenced how we tend to utilize the language together particularly today and over say the
past two three hundred years um the malware package that's attached to languages evolves
over time along with the language it's not clear that the languages contain malware rather it's the
suppositions underlying their deployment and particularly their deployment um beyond the
personal like the person-to-person environment in the larger social and
and disease riddled cultural
dumpster fire that is you know modernity
back into the gusty winds but not too dangerous here
so there's no trees likely to drop a branch on me near me
all right so
recently I've been listening to people like David Berlinsky and actually there's a primary
author whose name I can't remember but also
um a man whose name I'm going to mispronounce David Gilertner and if you want to find one of the
things I listen to um just search on mathematics and Darwin and okay so Darwin's book was called
The Origin of Species it is by it is you know he was the Einstein in a sense of biology
