in that he gave us a map that appeared to be valid and explanatory for a broad range of
uh observable phenomena um and doctrinally
it is canon to oppose it in any way is to earn broad denigration attack insult
and this is unfortunate because science should never be about doctrine
science should be about discovery
and logical rational thought it should not cater to biases or presuppositions
in fact it shouldn't cater to anything but the facts and an ever improving description
of the relationships between them that we observe obviously this involves explanatory
manifolds so intuition and suppositions about identity function
distinction and and you know the scientific method is fundamentally disseptive so it tends
to break things down into parts and then examine relationships that by itself can be an error
but um
nearly every biologist believes well maybe that's not true many many modern biologists believe that
a moment
that the book entitled the origin of species
does in fact tell us how species arose
and so is generally accepted as an origin of life argument tells us how we got species from
the origin you know organisms now it doesn't make any I don't I don't actually know the
book well my doubt explains about origin of life because that's still quite mysterious
even though the mechanical physicalist
eliminative materialist version is either soup you got a complex soup on earth that
eventually produced cells or you know RNA and then there's some you know leaped from RNA
to cells and DNA and bacteria and protists and archaea and so forth
but nobody knows how you get from chemistry to life there are precisely zero successful models of this
uh lots of people have speculations some of those speculations the belief is generally
and what is taught is that life is the mechanical result of the combination of chemicals
and forces on earth
and a number of scientists who are not trying to import god into biology
are making the claim for intelligent design by falsifying something resembling
Darwin's blind watchmaker claim
i.e okay so the one of the old proofs of the existence of god was the unimaginable complexity
of organisms now our human experience of that complexity and our cognition about it has changed
quite a bit over many years
particularly since Darwin and has been influenced by a bunch of doctrinal garbage
that really has nothing to do with it but a long time ago someone possibly bacon
argued maybe it was Francis Bacon i don't i can't remember
argued that the existence of organisms proves the existence of god because
if you were walking along a if you were walking along a path in the forest
and you look down and you saw for example
i'm going to use a sort of weird example a colander
right
or a knife
i'm using a very simple physical object a knife you would not presume
be very unlikely for you to presume that the knife had been produced by the accidental combination
of substance and forces
there are certain kinds of objects
that naturally to our intuition imply a mind was involved in creating them
and fundamentally these objects can be said and in some cases blatantly obviously do
they can be said to encode information
so for example
dna is a digital data storage and propagation machine if we think in those terms i don't
but i'll use the language common to biologists of my day they tend to think as the they think
they think of cells and organisms as machines which i think is hilarious i get what they mean
um they don't mean diesel engine they mean
a structured process that causes the transformation combination and distinction
of various substances and structures over time
i mean something resembling that i don't think of them as machines but we'll use the language so
where was i the machines
there are precise precisely zero instances we know of
of where complex ordered information was produced without a mind
the biologists are presuming
unjustifiably that the cell is such an arrangement there is no evidence for that in fact
if we do the math these scientists argue
um i think one of the guys wrote a book that might be called darwin's delusion
and by the way what they're saying is effectively this
darwin got the theory right for downstream transformations of genomes mutations
changing parts of an animal from you know a bat wing to a bird wing or something
all right um mutations that don't wipe out the organism and we'll get to an interesting feature
of that in a minute so the scientists that are questioning this and look we don't have any good
arguments for origin of life panspermia is a change of arena right that's a rhetorical fallacy
you just move the you move the question elsewhere without supplying any useful further information
about it right um because you have the same problem with panspermia that you have with
origin of life on earth if life traveled here from elsewhere it had to begin somehow
and so it either began on a planet like ours or it began in an interstellar space or
it began somewhere maybe something we don't even understand you know again
the origin of life could be so profound that the concepts we presently rely on
uh
are insufficient all right um though the scientists rarely argue this
so what they're saying so first of all we have no good explanation for the origin of life
many biologists believe that it's essentially a mechanical accident there's no evidence for
the involvement of an intelligence uh the east scientists believe that there's no evidence for
the accident in fact they cite mathematical analyses of for example the probability of
accidentally producing what um a useful protein i think is the example they gave
i can't recall if they were examining for you know an amino acid or what specific
um biochemical element they were they were speaking of but i think what they said
is that the chances of producing a useful protein by accident okay the search space is
something like one in ten to the seventy and that's just one protein we're not talking about
you accidentally produced an organism um that resembles the probability of being able to locate
a single point particle say uh proton single proton in a search space nine like as large as
nine of our universe as we presently understand it the chances of you might as well call it
it says if you want to say it's impossible i'm on your side if you want to say it's
improbable i'm on your side but let's be clear it's monumentally probable
and you know something i've argued for probably almost 20 years is that the complexity of the cell
radically defies anything any explanation that the humans can come up with at all
and this has turned out to be prophetic in that every 10 years or so
the complex as the complexity as the apparent complexity of the cell expands for our science
perhaps sometimes geometrically the possibility of explaining it recedes with every expansion
um and it recedes at a similar pace right it's like you thought you knew what was going on you
now found out there were 10 trillion variables you weren't including your chance of explaining that
mostly just disappears into infinity
um
you know in my perspective uh i think our physical theories are insufficient to explain biological
phenomena and their origins and their meanings and almost certainly their purposes which of
which reproduction is not you know in the physicalist lexicon that's the crucial thing to do
there's probably 900 other things they're doing and there's certainly 15 of those that are
or nothing like what we suppose if you actually observe organisms with an open mind
you're going to discover something that generally defies description
it's not there for description for the purpose of humans describing it there's nothing to do
okay what the heck is this it's an artificial rock
i don't understand oh i see it's a rat trap it's a rat trap that looks like a rock
wow humans are crazy
hmm
i think i should visit my friend the tree
so
the scientists are in question here are very upset that textbook biology and the
the broad scale supposition of mechanical accident has origin for life
a proposition for which not only is there no evidence or nearly none
if we run some of the analytic math so that we come to understand
what the actual probabilities we we should be looking at are at this phase in our understanding
the math points in the direction that unless unless something really strange here happened
unless you hit the lottery you know unless you won the lottery
9 000 times in a row like you you won almost every time you played there's no chance
of producing not not never mind organisms just RNA DNA the complex protein synthesis apparatus
cells all of these things or not no chance but an unimaginable almost infinitely
unimaginably small chance literally you know zero
with a bit you know i don't know 5 000 decimal points after it and then a one
so uh i looked up the author
although perhaps burlinski has collaborated with him stephen meyer
they have some essays and books the deniable darwin darwin's doubt
and i suspect they also make arguments that darwin himself doubted
that his theory was any explanation for the emergence of organisms on earth or
for the poorly defined idea of species
so it turns out that the origin of life arguments that are doctrinal are mostly nonsense
uh it's not that they're that it's entirely impossible that the emergence of life on earth
was a purely mechanical accident it's we have the actual problem you know minus uh the supposition
of god in the original argument that if you find something finely articulated and what could
be more finely articulated than a blue jay it makes i mean just at it at the level of its cells
its 900 magnitudes of complexity beyond any machine we've ever built a single cell
staggers the the computational complexity of the entire history of humans doing math
and it does that over the temporal space of like 10 seconds or maybe even one and we're talking
a single cell so you have a cell either hyper structure like a blue jay or a raccoon you're
looking at something that is pure science fiction there's no chance of something that
sophisticated and agentive was produced by accident at least not in any way that we can
presently propose
when we find in nature extremely complex objects invariably
they are the produce of minds with zero known exceptions so it's it's sort of the opposite
of the problem we have with um sorry i'm getting battered by the weather
it's the opposite of the problem we have with the technical probability of there being life
on other planets technically
due to how statistics and probability function if you have only a single
example of something
you have no chance of determining the probability therefore the probability is
is stated as zero so until probabilistically according to how we use statistics and probability
um there is zero probability of life on other worlds because it's unknown you have no data
all right with no data you can't produce a probabilistic estimate there are other ways
to estimate the probability intuitively we are very unlikely to believe that
in a universe as vast as ours this is the only planet with life that life we would have to
believe that life cannot spread from solar system to solar system or that there are no
mechanisms for that transfer to take place because if there were especially if there were fast
methods um something possibly shell drakes morphogenic fields might represent
a sort of layer in in the universe or in time space in which once you manage to get an organism
on one world somewhere in time it's now vastly easier to get it on another one
um I doubt any of these scientists are fans of sheltering meaning burlinski,
alertner, and mire
but what I'm what I'm getting at is it could be that there are features of the everything
and I prefer that term or really the every one thing way all nests there are features of the
grand unity that we don't know anything about and could easily I think could reasonably possibly
set up a network between planets where information is transferred either at incredible speed or
instantaneously there might be forms of fields capable of doing this but this is my argument not
there's um what is their argument so their argument is that if you take the entire biospace
of organisms that we believe have ever existed on earth this includes you know bacteria viruses
the whole thing everything that number is something like 10 to the 40
if you then divide the search space 10 to the 70 by the number of chances you have
to produce say one useful protein
you're left with I don't know 10 to the 30 or something
um which is effectively no chance it means that over the history of life on earth there wasn't
time to accidentally assemble a useful protein uh unless something was going on that we don't
understand and this inclines them to believe that that the explanation of intentional terraforming
was vastly vastly more probable than this was a mechanical accident you got some chemistry together
you got some forces together out pops organisms that make unimaginably complex proteins and you
know RNA DNA mRNA all of these things right uh that stuff just pops up you know on a roulette wheel
all right just keep spinning the wheel long enough out comes archaea
so yeah wildly unlikely
whatever Darwin showed us it wasn't how species originated a really good grasp on
certain features of of biology
mutation selection all this but nothing for how species arise right how do you get a different
animal from a prototype we don't know and it's very unlikely to be accidental
so it turns out there's another problem
which is something like the incredible amount of wind and rain pounding into my face at the
moment no i'm kidding um there's another problem with where the kinds of mutations that would
give you a different animal from a prototype animal have to happen early in blastogenesis
i might have that wrong but they have to happen fairly early
in the process of producing an organism from oocytes right from from egg and sperm and so forth
um although uh the language is more complex than what i'm when i'm presenting here i'm not sure
a sperm is a i think there's a different word for the sperm uh so you have to produce a mutation
early in the process to get a different animal and if you produce mutations early in the process
what you get is a dead animal like if you make any mistake early in the process it's invariably
fatal so if you get an early mutation they said like someone said it was probably um
an alert I think he said you know you have like 19 tails or way too many organs that don't fit
inside the animal or you leave out like it doesn't make blood right something fundamental goes sideways
