and the only way to get different animals that we know of that we can imagine
is mutations early in the in the process of generating the animal
again those mutations tend to be fatal so you can't use mutations early in the process
and late in the process later in the process doesn't produce different animals it produces
different traits so effectively if I understood their argument there's no space
in the developmental arc of an organism that we can understand
that would allow a mutation to produce a new animal so how do you get stuff like the Cambrian
explosion it looks like on earth we have something rather than um gradual meticulous evolution of
animals which I think was long held to be the likely case we have sudden like pulses
of unexpected diversification blossoming of myriad species myriad different organisms
and that certainly isn't explained by anything we have no idea
how you get I mean I have some propositions about this I would argue that um
it's probably it could be helpful very helpful to look at the organisms of earth as a single
organism an organism that naturally diverges from its origins or naturally enacts its original
what
naturally enacts its original endowments and propensities by diversifying
um that leaves me challenged to the same problem that any biologist would be challenged with which
is explain the the mechanism that produces the diversification we have no explanation
so we go back to the problem of you find a wrist watch all right you find something as
complex as a wrist watch and by the way let's be very clear a cell is I don't know 10 to the 900
times more complex than a wrist watch so you find one of those
you know imagine I don't know imagine you're walking around on a
on a new planet
and you find what I don't even know a hyper computer the size of a pinhead
you discover that there's these little pinhead like crystals on the ground
when you examine them you determine that they're hyper computers they can warp time
you can do all kinds of impossible things
and you decide oh the universe must just have accidentally produced these
like the possibility of accidental production of an organism is so much more remote
than the accidental production over wrist watch
there's no chance there's no way we could understand
how such complexity could be accidentally produced in the time frame we suppose now
if you know it's not even clear that the universe has been around long enough to do that
not not clear enough to me given our estimates of its age and presuming that what we're thinking
about is time is even relevant at the scale of the universe which it may not be could be
totally some other property that governs that and possibly most likely one we have no concept for
all right so what else what other problems so many problems
there are still people who believe and do science around the supposition
that it's a mechanical accident and it's reproducible we can figure out
how to produce the mechanical accident in the lab and thus produce life forms from forces and substances
the hubris implicit in the
suppositions
of the materialists
and those who
unjustifiably
presume that no intelligences were involved in the production of the intelligence with
which they examine the question it's an accidental you know it's an epiphenomenon right
of the nature of time space planets and stars right they just accidentally produced these
minds there's nothing mind like in them there's nothing metamind like there's nothing transcendent
in them and it's an entirely mechanical process unguided by anything right it's just not the
only thing that guides it are in some way the forces which would be you know chemical bonding
properties chemical transformation properties gravity electromagnetism strong force the weak
force etc etc seems unlikely to me so that's been a fascinating i never really believed that
to be honest i never supposed
i didn't trust the doctrines
i can sense dark doctrines and sort of smell the stink of them in various branches of science
and philosophy and i tend to be uh i let's just say i have great antipathy for them
in my own view there are a variety of intelligences
i don't merely suppose that intelligences were involved in the composition of organisms i take
the claim much further it seems very likely to me that something beyond intelligence was involved
probably in the construction of time space because you have a similar problem there right
which is the fine-tuning problem and it's a huge problem now there is one way to
sort of what's the right word there's one way to account for the fine-tuning problem
that's a little strange but interesting to mention it is that you have a sort of a popcorn machine
right but instead of producing popped kernels of corn it produces universes and most of those
universes are not viable the forces don't interact quote unquote properly or in such a way as to
what what is meant by viable is achieves extent in time
so
you keep bubbling these universes up from some universe progenitor field okay
and the non-viable universes mostly quickly dissolve and only the viable universes persist
so you will naturally if you find yourself anywhere if you find yourself at all
you will find yourself in a persistent universe otherwise you won't have a self to find or find
with and this is sometimes offered as an explanatory
an explanatory prosthesis
for
for the strangely perfect you know the goldilocks universe
and the goldilocks solar system both right because you have to have both you can't have a goldilocks
universe i mean you can't have a goldilocks solar system in a non-goldilocks universe so
in this model something just keeps producing nascent universes and some of those turn out to be
viable and you will only have minds and bodies and organisms in those that do therefore that you
know sort of explains the the existence of the fine-tuning problem what was myers objection to
that it was kind of brilliant i know he was using someone else's objection
i wonder if i can recall it
i don't think i can but yeah i find this fascinating and brilliant because these
are serious scientists they are not theists even though one of them might be religious
maybe a couple of them are i'm not sure but they're not attempting to import god
right they're not trying to sneak god past your scientific nose they're saying look
the complexity we're discovering here cannot have been produced there's not enough time to have
produced even some of its more basic features in terms of the age of the earth now i could see
that someone could say produce the features off world somewhere import them to the earth and then
things go along fine i can imagine that line of argument but you you you may have the same problem
elsewhere what's the actual lifespan of a planet presuming that that's that life only
occurs on planets which is something i don't presume since i don't know where life originates
i i tend to be open-minded and speculative about that but yeah we've got a huge problem with the
origin of life on earth in modern science the problem is steeped in doctrine the doctrine
makes no sense never made sense similar to the move to evacuate the universe of meaningful
intelligences right because we were we were science was so busy trying to get rid of god
that it threw everything away it just decided no it's all it's all just mechanics dude there's no
there's no evidence of any kind of um there's no evidence of any kind of intelligence versions
of what we used to call the ether which probably got replaced by
the the the the the propensity of time space to curve around mass to become curved at at at
complex structure and now more than like there may be forces that we don't know about too
right i mean i'm quite sure there must be constants and forces that we haven't discovered
that might naturally mechanically produce life but we can't argue for the existence of those
until we have some evidence of them and we can't make arguments that this the complexity we're
seeing just plopped out of a roulette wheel there's no real chance of that being true as far as i can
see so i am now home and safe and alive i am grateful for all of you who have braved this
long journey with me the terrifying noise of the wind in the mic i'm grateful for all of you who

or or shared link or something and if you if you'd like to support my work more directly i'd be very
grateful for that a dollar a month matters um if you want to make a one-time donation uh just let
me know in the comments and i'll i'll get you a way to do that i'm so grateful to those who do
support my work thank you all of you you help me keep making this content and i'm really really
appreciate it so i look forward to learning together again very soon may your ways and world
be blessed amazing and joyful bye bye for now
