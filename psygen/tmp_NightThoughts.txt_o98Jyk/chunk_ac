Or worrying.
Or whatever I'm doing.
Some kind of nonsensical thing I'm doing most of the time.
Or three nonsensical things at once.
Or who knows what.
But here in the dawn for a moment, I remember.
And I can feel it again.
You know, sometimes it takes an invocation.
Sometimes you really have to take off your armor and go naked to the sky and the world.
Drop all the games.
And just be who you are.
The songs of the birds.
They're like living water.
So ancient and alive.
The light in the sky.
I'm hearing something I've never heard before.
Some kind of bird song.
I'm too curious to let it be.
It's hard to triangulate on.
I wonder if it's a whip or a person making that noise.
These days I have to wonder if it's a device.
I sure can't tell where its side it's coming from.
It's like a ho-ho-woo!
Ho-ho-woo-woo!
I'll find the chance.
I don't know if I'll be brave enough to post this, I guess we'll see in time.
It's gone from dark to light, and I'm almost back to the place where I sleep.
An early morning new moonwalk.
I'm grateful to you who travel with me in the hope of remembering together.
And being a light in the life of our minds and our hearts and our souls and the world.
I'm grateful to all of you.
I remember you.
I remember you.
