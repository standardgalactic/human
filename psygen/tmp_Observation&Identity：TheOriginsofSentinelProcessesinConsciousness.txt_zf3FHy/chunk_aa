Hello everybody, thank you for joining me.
I've just found some tracks, probably coyote tracks in the moist earth and I was following them.
Though I'm not a trained tracker and I'm not very skillful, I can still learn things
from the animals and plants, their activities, what they pay attention to and when, times
of things, places.
Today, when I came to the garden, I was planning on getting some sun and the blue jays here,
we know each other well, we are friends and in a sense, in order to get to know them,
one could think of it in different ways, but I brought something to share with them,
something that would be valuable in their world, something that they could recognize as a gift.
And we've been friends for quite some time and they teach me things,
if I'm paying attention, but they also learn from observing me, so we learn together.
And they've seen me meditating on a specific bench that I like and they often hang around
while I'm doing that, even though they're aware, in some way, that this is a time of stillness for me.
I remember once, I think the boy flew right past my head while I was meditating and I
could feel the wind from his wings, almost as if he were about to land on my head.
But they hang out with me and then after a while, of course they're in time in a very different way than I am
and this is the astonishing, one of the really astonishing things about being alive together,
is that in the place where we might think of as being the between of us, in the between,
the space in between us, not just the physical space, the relational space, it becomes enriched
and their way of being in time meets with my ways of being in time
and in that between, new forms of time are born and expressed that are a sharing of our different temporalities.
When we think about the idea we call life span and we think in metric time, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years,
we can become confused very easily by these ideas so that we think that a second is always the same amount of time or a minute
and mechanically it's not untrue but it's insufficiently true because machines aren't living beings and don't experience anything
so one mechanical minute is an empty thing, it's empty of being, it's empty of relation, it's the kind of time that throws everything away before the measurement is made
and by everything I really mean a lot.
So you know a small bird has a different life span than me but it's also in time in a very different way
an ant is in time in a way that's different from a flower or a plant or an herb or a tree or a whale or a bumblebee or a hummingbird
a turtle is in time in a very different way than a bat
and we can imagine that there are these forms of living time that are embodied in the living creatures
and all of their myriad relationships and the endless dimensions of between in those relationships
where new kinds of time, meaningful embodied relational time are shared
so today when I took off most of my clothes to get some sun and sat down on the bench where I sometimes meditate
I saw a new behavior to me in one of the Blue Jays
it went to the ground near a bush in the sun and it sort of cleared out a little hollow in the bark
and then it fluffed up and spread its wings out
and it was a very surprising thing because I may have seen this before but I certainly don't recall it
and what it was doing was sunbathing
and its sun bathed only for a few minutes and I could tell it became very warm
because when birds become warm they often help to cool themselves by opening their mouths
and so after seeing me take off my clothes and sit down on the bench
the Blue Jay who is my friend apparently decided that's not a bad idea
I think I'll have some sunbathing too right now with my human friend nearby
and we can sunbathe together
it's so beautiful
it's like we might imagine with our critical adult intelligence that it's like a children's story
and I was quite enchanted by this sharing of sun time together
I've never seen them do that sunbathing thing
it may be that they do it somewhat regularly and I've never noticed
but they've never done it around me
and it's no accident
it's no mere coincidence
that when my friend the bird saw me take off all my clothes
it knew what I was doing
and it not only was aware of that
and could demonstrate that it was aware of it to me in a very beautiful way
it was also saying we can go together in the sunlight for a moment
now my sitting was I don't know half an hour 40 minutes in the sun
and the birds was only a few minutes
maybe not even a few maybe two
but we were sharing
and that sharing can't really be encompassed by language or concepts or tests or theories
it's much deeper than all of that it's much older than all of that
most of that stuff is really very very new
if we think of time in terms of the age of the world
but not just the single age of the world
the combined age of all of the beings that have ever existed here
and this is one of the problems that humans have when we think about time
our machines have deceived us
we don't understand that organisms form trans-temporal hyper structures of relational time
in which there's an exchange, a transformation, a relationship
that allows us to participate in each and be informed and transformed
by the unique symphony of temporalities in nature
and this I find endlessly fascinating and astonishing
I remember when it first occurred to me that something like this was possible
I nearly lost my mind with astonishment
because I realized that each of the cells in my body
and all of the microbial life on earth
is experiencing time at a radically different rate
perhaps one day per minute or for a cell
and in the between of them time is exploding like light from the sun
organisms make time
we can think of this mechanically but it's not very helpful
you see each of the processes in the cell has different rhythms
so even within a single cell there are organelles
if it's a eukaryote animal cell
and the organelles have their own temporalities within the cell
and so time is a many splendid thing
and it helps to transfer a couple of concepts that we neglected
to understand very deeply because we were mostly concerned with physics, not relation
from relativity
and the first of those concepts is non-simultaneity
no two observers can experience the same stimuli at the same time
in fact as each observer occupies a unique world line
it's not possible for them to experience the same thing at the same time
to do so they would have to absolutely share all world lines
which would mean they'd be the same creature
and there are some deeply fascinating repercussions of this fact
in thinking about time
I think we've been misled to think of time like a bowl
and if two things are in the bowl for a minute
well they both experience that same minute, that same duration
it's not so
in fact they each experience especially if they're organisms
but even if they're not
they each are experiencing and contributing to myriad temporalities
not merely the time inside the bowl
it's hard to find a good analogy for how astonishing this is
if we can entertain an idea about it
and particularly if we're able to have the kinds of ideas that lead us from thought
into direct experience of temporalities
when I look at the animal tracks
I wonder when they were made
it can't be very long ago
they look pretty fresh
the soil had been moist
now it's drying out
the tracks are pretty fresh
it might be a regular dog and not a coyote
some people bring dogs in here and perhaps sometimes dogs get in here on their own
so I'm not sure what made the tracks
I'm fairly sure it was a coyote
so it occurred to me after my meditation
that it might be interesting to talk about observation
to watch other beings in situations
and also
peculiarly
the senses we have and concerns we have about being observed
now this is a really deep topic
and our modern situation is extremely bizarre
because now we're being observed, catalogued, analyzed
psychographized by machines
for the purposes of institutions
not really for the purposes of people
and that's a terrifying wrongness
unless our technological cultures crash
which probably will happen
whether or not it happens immediately is another question
but unless they collapse we must expect this kind of thing
that will be going on far into the future
and we may need to learn how to change the priorities
that are involved in mechanical observation
in such a way that at least if they are not overtly healthy
they're not overtly harmful
and it's an accomplishable task
I have some models around that that I call the knowledge ant
but it's not my goal to talk about that today
I want to talk about seeing one another
and how that works and some features of observation and thought
that are unique in how our species experiences and enacts them
the bird, I do not know exactly what was going on in its mind
I suspect it has a mind
but probably not a conceptual or linguistic mind
or if it does it has a very unique version of this
but when it saw me take my clothes off to sunbathe
it thought something
it had some feeling, some urge
its own perspective
and somehow it decided
hey, that's a nice thing
let's do that together
let's have some together time in sunbathing
and it's aware that I'm observing it
and I'm aware that it's observing me
and we're both aware that we're observing each other
and that our nature and interiority is transformed by observation
it changes
it's not the same as being alone
the birds are very clear that we have a friendship
we've established trust
over time
the regularity of the safety
they can feel around relating with me
is unique
they may have other human friends
they may have other bird friends and animal friends too
plant friends and tree friends
this place they live in is like an externalized womb
and this is a very important thing to understand
because all of the living beings of Earth
are living in a shared externalized womb
and if the womb is damaged
all of them suffer from it
all of them
now nature is very complex
and organisms are profoundly opportunistic
so they can hitchhike on all kinds of things
but there are some things the complex organisms cannot survive
even if the microorganisms can find new ways
of taking advantage of changes in the environment
so while damage to the womb affects every being
because it's a shared context
a living shared context like a womb
we humans have to have special awareness of this
and we're trained to have the opposite
we're trained to offload the damage of luxury inconvenience
on all other beings
and when we're engaged in that kind of behavior
we're just harming the living beings now
we're harming the living beings in the past
