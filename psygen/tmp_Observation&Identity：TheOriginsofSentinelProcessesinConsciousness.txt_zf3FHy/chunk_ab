by defecting from our unity and communion with them
and the unspoken agreements that living beings preserve
when they're actually intelligent
and we're harming the living beings in the future
we're harming our own children
we're harming each other
we're harming the context
now it's not possible to exist without causing harm
but there are degrees
some of which are catastrophically misguided and deadly
and our species particularly at the collective level
but often at the individual level
has made a tradition
out of being disconnected from the womb
and thinking ourselves separate and distinct
omnipotent and unavailable to harm
and this is a complex thing
because our history is very strange
rather than living where it's good for us to live
we developed technologies
and wore the skins of other beings
so we could survive where it's very cold
and we developed ways of surviving where it's very hot
and so we kind of spread everywhere
and we transform elements of the environment into objects
which means killing
and not just the elements that are transformed
but of course the waste that is produced and so on
and all of this is quite problematical
and I can lather on about it another time
that presumes there is another time
but today I want to talk a little bit about our social nature
and our psychological nature
whether or not we buy into psychology as a science
or an art or practice
we can learn astonishing things from paying attention
maybe even from outside the context of psychology
so that the insights we might discover there
can be translated into other kinds of insight
useful in the broader context of our human experience
and interiority
because we are profoundly social creatures
and again in modernity
forgive me when I generalize here
I'm aware of generalizing and it's dangerous
because we are so profoundly social
various aspects of our social needs
can be captured and counterfeited
and sold back to us in broken, unnerishing or toxic forms
and our institutions and cultures
have become very adept at this process
and in fact most of why we are being observed by machines
is because there are corporations
and companies and governments
that want to steal our attention
they want to seduce us
into joining their program
whatever that may be
which gas station do you buy gasoline at
which socks do you wear
what shoes do you like
which foods do you buy
how are they packaged
which shows do you watch
when do you watch them
the capacity for mechanical analysis
of our attentional habits
and our rhythms
and our peculiar personal interests
concerns, fears, outrages and so on
all of this can be captured in ways
that counterfeit
our true essence as humans
that counterfeit our needs
and sell us dead tokenized replicas
or dolls in a way of them
but what I'm actually concerned about today
are the processes in our minds
and these are mental habits
that once acquired become extremely compelling
much like addictions if not actually being addictions
and so we have concerns
many of us about how we are seeing
and who is seeing us
now some of us have become a bit more sophisticated here
and we may have concerns
that are slightly the polarity of that
with what kind of mind or intent
am I observing the tree
or the man or the child or the woman
or the grandmother or the dog or the cat
or the show on TV or Facebook or Instagram or whatever
because these observational behaviors
can actually catalyze
and require different kinds of minds
our observational behaviors change our rhythms
they change our priorities, our values
and in most of what we're subject to as moderns
changes are undesirable and dangerous
but in our minds
we, I think you'll all agree
we have concerns about how we are viewed
how we are seen
what others might think
what possible others might think
what's theoretical others
average people, the common people, the normal people
the ordinary people
what the authorities will think
the police, the government, the institutions
what they will make of our behavior
and whether or not they will try to punish us
or deprive us of something essential
and even when we are thinking in our minds
essentially by ourselves
these concerns can become so profound
that in our thoughts
the idea of possible others observing us
can transform so that we experience it
specific implementations or styles of it
we can come to imagine
that our worst fears are always happening
that people and corporations and institutions that observe us
are observing us with malign or judgmental or critical intention
and sometimes that's true
but our minds are so malleable, so changeable
that we can have the experience of being tortured by observation
even when none is occurring
we can have the experience of being tortured
by the possibility of judgment rendered into the fact of being judged by our imaginations
and in our minds we can't tell the difference between that
and actually judgmental or hateful or malign intentions in others
often when I'm speaking with someone I love or care for
I will hear in their speech
the sounds of the particular music
of the intrusion of an inner critic or judge
or analyst or comparator
and people will ask me questions like
is it weird that I don't feel the urge to smile when I see other people
or they'll actually just say
I must be weird because I don't participate in some behavior
that's considered by theoretical cohorts in my mind
imagined populations of normal people
I must be weird because I don't do this thing
or I must be weird because I do this thing
that confuses some people
and with our critical faculties some can quickly become all
and now we're in a trap where our awareness has been compromised
by a concern introduced by measuring
and sometimes we may have these concerns
when some aspect of our life path and experience transforms
particularly if we've been isolated
because in isolation these kinds of trouble
problems become much more common and entrenched over time
if we're not receiving positive attention from others
there's an aspect of our awareness, our social intelligences
that will go looking for reasons why
why am I not being loved
why do I always eat alone
why am I unworthy of the care and concern
that I see others apparently sharing in their life
and these questions have the propensity to form processes
and those processes become more elaborate
and dominant in our consciousness when we're isolated
or in crisis or when we're sick
or dysregulated, the harmonies of the rhythms of our bodies
and metabolisms and thoughts become dysregulated
and that's a strange word dysregulated
what I mean is the synchronizations are broken
and so the processes not only can no longer hitchhike on each other's rhythms
and activities, accomplishments
something like the opposite happens
where they begin to conflict very severely
and aspects of our mind can literally go to war
with the remnants of what might have been
a healthy, enjoyable, fulfilling way of being human
in our awareness and in our thoughts and in our concerns
and we have another problem which is that
various kinds of accounting can happen in thought
and also important kinds of similar processes can die out
and be replaced by things that are relatively toxic,
delusional, dangerous, painful and confusing
and all of us will have some experience of this
it doesn't matter who we are or when we live, where we live, who we're with
we will all have some experience of this
you know, sometimes I put some water on the stove to boil and cook some food
and then I go in the other room while the water is heating up
because it's not my intention to watch the pot until it boils
so I might do something in the other room
maybe I'll distract myself and look at Facebook or mess around on my computer
most of the time not doing anything very interesting with that astonishing piece of technology
sometimes I do
and after a while I will, usually I will smell something
I will smell the steam or I may smell something burning if I've waited too long
and then I'll realize, oh crap, that pot on the stove
I became distracted and as many of you know in old pots and steel pots and such
when water burns it's really a problem
and it's actually kind of a crazy idea that water can burn
but the pot on the stove is kind of a crazy thing
so what's happening there is a sentinel process
