a process that watches over something
first I get distracted
so that process isn't getting the funding and awareness of attention that it would otherwise get
and when that happens the process may wake up a bit later
and sort of metaphorically tap me on the shoulder and say, hey, what about that pot on the stove
I give this as an example of a sentinel process
and we have many different kinds
we have opportunity sentinels
things that are on the lookout for possibilities that would be beneficial
or would perhaps allow us more time to not do anything productive
for example, when I'm walking around
I often pay fairly close attention to small features around me and on the ground
and it's not uncommon that I'll find money
or rather it's uncommon but it occurs
and so my opportunity sentinel has cashed the awareness
didn't mean the pun there
that it's possible to find very valuable things on the ground
and sometimes I find someone's wallet and the last time that happened
I was actually able to locate the person non-electronically
and return their wallet to them
even though I couldn't figure out where they lived
or if they were visiting or are they around where I find the wallet
so it was kind of a peculiar thing where first I found the wallet
it had a little money in it, I don't know, 30 bucks or something
I kept it all together in a plastic bag
and then eventually I saw a man on the street
and I said, is your name Axe and he said yes
well, I think I may have found something that belongs to you
would you mind telling me your last name
and he told me his last name and I said yes
yes, it's you, I have your wallet
wait here, I'll go get it
and I did and was able to return it to him
and he tried to give me some money out of the wallet
and I said no, no
and he said well I really appreciate it
and I said well that's a wonderful reward by itself
so there are all different kinds of opportunities
and most of them we're unaware of
in fact in the vast forest of available opportunities
us humans are mostly a bit like zombies
we pay attention only to those things that we habitually pay attention to most of the time
and thus we're often sort of sleepwalking through life
with a broken opportunity sentinel
and in many cases an extremely inflated threat sentinel
I remember meeting electronically coming into contact with a young woman
and when we first spoke
I think some people are concerned
that I might be judgmental or intimidating
because they have never met me
and their ideas about me are based on their exposure to my posts
and I can understand why someone who read my posts
might think that I was a very cunning analyst or judge
and their threat sentinel could get quite charged up
and think oh this person will judge me
and that's not an unreasonable concern
if by reasonable we mean possible
now possibility is a really strange thing
because it's not amenable to analysis
unless we can get some data points and some statistics
and transform our thought of possibility
we can begin sort of chasing that
and we can produce an analytical framework
in which probabilities can be derived
of course this is a big problem for our physics knowledge
with quantum mechanics and perhaps with string theory
I don't think we yet understand we're missing something
we're missing something really fundamental and blatant
something a child could probably see
but that would be very difficult for a sophisticated intelligence
that was normatively encultured
I hate that word normative
that was enculturated in the time that we live
with the ideas the catalog of ideas and theories and explanations
that are currently at play
in any case I remember a meeting with this young woman
and she could barely speak
it's not because she has any trouble speaking
or can't form words or thoughts
but rather each time she tried to form an utterance
a number of critical observers in her mind
intervened and could see ways to frame
what she was trying to say as something other
than what she was trying to communicate
and because she felt this pressure of her critical processes
and these are aspects of threat sentinels by the way
she could not really emit a sentence
she would start to and pause
and then there would be an angry no
or a string of the word like
like no
well if I know
like something like this
this person who I'm speaking of is somebody I love very dearly
and I don't judge her
but she helps me understand my own mind
with her struggles
and over time
she realized that not only was I not going to judge her
but that it was very easy for me to love and care for her
and learn with her
and benefit from her unique life experience
and ways of mind
and after we became comfortable together
she was able to speak much more clearly
and that was a joyful moment
and I think has continued even though
current circumstances are presenting
very serious problems
for the mental well-being
of our people
unfortunately our context
and the way it intrudes upon awareness
dominating it
subjugating it
enslaving it
this causes
aspects of our potential intelligence
to attack their own origin
much in the same way
that our species as an extended cohort
is actively obliterating
the living womb that all beings here share
so many of us
and I have my own experience of this
are trapped in a sense
with forms of behavior
cognitive behavior, emotional behavior, mental behavior
that are fundamentally toxic
and once they become well established
they will then compete to remain well established
the same way a corporation that gets funding
competes not necessarily to solve the problems
it may have been formed to solve
but instead to survive and distribute itself
as widely as possible
and grab terrain and market and so on
so there is an aspect of
the way we have minds
such that processes
that are continuously or frequently enacted
gain precedence very quickly
and they can draw more and more
of our attentional energy, our awareness energy
our consciousness energy
away from the pool that could otherwise
be differently invested
be differently enacted
be differently embodied
and all of us have some exposure to these problems
and for some of us we have little else
I know and love people whose minds
are constant battleground
of terrifying criticisms, judgments
rages, shame
histories, brokenness
and for some of these people
it's very rare for them to get even one minute
where the sentinels that have become dominant
in their mind settle down enough
for them to have something resembling awareness
or the capacity to direct their attention
according to what is good and true
and pleasing
what is healthy and beneficial
for them
and yet
even with these particular people I'm thinking of
when we are together
we both transform because the relational between of us
has opportunities that their mind on its own doesn't have
and that my mind on its own doesn't have
so in that relational between
we can choose to create a context
that nurtures and celebrates
our capacities for loving kindness
for clear undivided attention
for play, for wonder
for an amnesis, the remembering of ourselves
the remembering of our origins, natures
potentials, opportunities
and sometimes
it can take quite some time
to
usefully contend with
the processes and concerns
fears and agonies
that we are both carrying in our unique ways
somehow we have to find a way to sweep all that aside momentarily
or set it down
so that there's some energy available to us
to invest
in a way that's mutually nourishing
nurturing, healing
inspired and beautiful
but we do
even if it's a struggle
even if it takes hours
sometimes
to drill down through
