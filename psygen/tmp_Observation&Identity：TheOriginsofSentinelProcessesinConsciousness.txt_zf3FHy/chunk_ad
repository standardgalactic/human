the highly structured habitual layers
of
historical inaction and dominance of threat sentinels and
harm accountants and
fear
yet we do
and when we do
it's as if we've both been released from prisons
and somehow
even if I'm not as fraught
in my mind as they may be
but
when we achieve a moment of freedom together
I am profoundly
excited and happy and joyful
and it feels really worth
the effort to have slogged through
all of the kind of toxic effluent
that our isolation
can build up
and when they see that blue sky of opportunity and freedom
even if just for a moment
part of me that was caged goes free
and we enjoy that liberation together
and that seems to me to be beautiful and human
trustworthy and true
but
most of us live
the life of our minds
is imprisoned
in layers and layers of structured histories
of enacting various sentinels and
it's terribly unfortunate
that when we are children we're introduced to the idea of courtrooms
and legalisms and justice
because those things have nothing really to do with justice
those are counterfeits of justice
in almost every case
again there may be exceptions again I'm generalizing but
the courtroom idea
that if only our case could be heard
people would finally understand
why we seem different from what they expect
why we did something
that's ordinarily thought of as wrong or bad
selfish or greedy
or violent
if we could tell the whole case
then others would finally see
the suffering we've been stewing in
often for decades
sometimes for lifetimes
and there's something to that
I don't wish to dismiss it entirely
and yet it's a broken model
of justice, the whole courtroom, prison
nightmare
that has been with our people for so long
and there are good examples of other peoples who
don't play that way
and for them
justice means the return to relational harmony
not the accounting of harm
debt
and punishment as payment
for debt
for when we engage in wrongdoing
there's no escaping
the debt
even if superficially
we're not punished
or charged
and we needn't fear that
in the fullness of time
our debts are taken care of
they dissolve
in various ways and transform
but it's not my goal here to talk much about that
what I'm more concerned about
is
that our minds
imagine
I'm not using the word simulate on purpose here
our minds are imaginal societies
and so when we're taught about courtrooms
we establish courtrooms in our minds
courtroom like processes
that we use to determine
whether we've been harmed or done harm or
deserve something or don't
and so on
and this is extremely confusing and confused because
in a healthy communal village
or a small cohort
relation
and its harmonies and benefits
would naturally acquire precedence
to any kind of abstract theory
or model
and this is really the problem here
it's abstraction
and what I mean by abstraction is
departure from actual relation
with our own interiority
the relational between and the interiorities of others
other beings, other humans
so that the result
is kind of a dead model
formed not in relation
but in something
that sometimes resembles rational thought
but is rarely full bodied enough
to achieve the forms of rationality
that would truly benefit our minds
and understanding, awareness, insight and intelligence
so our minds in a way
are imaginal societies
and when isolated
there's a very strong, gravidic tendency
for our minds to collapse toward constant
observation of threat
and what are people thinking
and what would these people think
and what do those people think
and why do they think this
and they must hate me
I hate them
all kinds of crazy nonsense
get storming around in the maelstrom of
our
the remnants of what otherwise might have been meaningful
experiences of awareness and relation
learning and intelligence, wonder, play
fulfillment
one of my friends
who apparently at some point decided
that I was just a very selfish bad person
this doesn't happen very often
but it does happen occasionally
and broke off contact with me
I remember him telling me once
that when he's walking down the street
he finds it extremely troubling
and disturbing
but he can't see what's going on behind him
and many of the processes
that I've been speaking about
have this strange propensity
to look backward
to reprocess histories
in an attempt to understand
a couple of things
what went wrong
how did I get in trouble
why was I judged
why was I evicted from relationships
why am I alone
where is the family
where are the beloved others
why is it so empty in here
now of course since we imagine societies
we take our cues
for their forms, purposes and structures
from the imprintings we underwent in childhood
and throughout our lives
we take cues from
what I think is misnamed
as culture
because most of
what is pointed at by this word
is really culture at all
it's a bunch of mimetic
contagious garbage and poison
so if we bring those processes inside
and imagine
build our little inner sociums
in their image
it's quite likely that nightmares will ensue
now not all of us are as vulnerable
to this
some of us are extremely vulnerable to this
in that we are inclined
toward these vulnerabilities
and others of us become vulnerable
when conditions are
really challenging
and isolation for humans is one of the most
challenging of conditions
I imagine that vast throngs of people
have lived and died in terrible isolation
however in the modern
situation it's much weirder
and it's deeply troubling because
we can be completely surrounded
by people in the heart of a metropolis
and still have no meaningful relationships
no positive observation
of beloved others
no praise
no celebration of our being
