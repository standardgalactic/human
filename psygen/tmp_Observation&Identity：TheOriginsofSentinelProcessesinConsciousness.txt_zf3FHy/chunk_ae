here together
and that presents
an irresolvable conflict
to the sentinels who might otherwise
attempt to understand something useful
about why we may be isolated
or injured or sick
or impoverty
and this form of
exacerbated hyperbolic conflict
is everywhere in our common daily experience
for most of the evolution
of our people
it wasn't possible
to be in constant exposure
to people with whom
we share no common
agreements, ceremonies
values
for most of our evolution
I think we lived
in relatively small, very intimate groups
and in small intimate groups
it's still possible
to become isolated
but it's not probable
it doesn't happen very often
and when it does it's often the sign that something has gone wrong
and the origins of that problem have to be looked into together
so that it can be resolved
and this was for
tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years
the common experience of being human is that we would do this together
when something went sideways
we would go looking for its origins
and attempt to resolve them at the origins
rather than
in the symptom
of a particular individual
so that if there was a problem
with an individual
the cohort would recognize
we've been making a mistake somewhere
otherwise this problem would not have emerged
and they would go questing
for the origin of the problem
and then there would be care
sacrifice perhaps
and celebration
unfortunately for us we live in
kind of the opposite situation where
once there's a problem
we attack the expresser of the problem
we presume it's the expresser's fault
this would be like presuming, I don't know
that
if I acquired an infection
there must be a problem with my hand
so I better punish my hand
alright
we attack the symptom
and what that does is double down
and inflate
the
the facets of its origin
that in so doing we ignore
it's a tragic situation
but it's also
it can help us to understand
how our minds
can become so warped
by our experience
that we can't form anything resembling
awareness
and it's an endless battle
of judges and critics
and analysts and accountants
and jailers and punishers
and torturers and so on
now I don't want to give the impression
that because I have some awareness of these things
that I am free of them
I'm actually just trying to understand more clearly
in the hopes that
with understanding
we can learn together
how to heal each other and also how to assemble contexts
even if they're only momentary
but they only last for a few minutes
or an hour or a day
in which we can do
the kind of inner archaeology
that can assist us
in accomplishing a changing of the guard
in our awareness so that
the sentinels are understood and respected
for their useful properties
but they don't become hyperbolic
and dominant and endlessly hungry
like some kind of a ghost or a monster
in our minds
and you know
it's not impossible to do this work alone
but it really needs a village
it needs a cohort
it's a very small cohort of two
or three
and this opportunity is always before us
anytime we can together
recall the opportunity and its value
and then travel in the general direction
we don't have to succeed all at once
we just have to make a little bit of progress
so that we can learn, ah, there's another direction
we can travel together
in our learning that can be very healing
and reassuring
nurturing
playful, joyful, humorous
healthy
we're an animal
that is profoundly hungry for meaningful roles
relationships
and
opportunities
to deepen
our mutual concern and awareness
and presence and love
it's ironic
that an animal so profoundly
in need of deep
meaningful social relation
is constantly subjected
to every other kind of nonsense
and pain
it's even more ironic
when we're in a context where we're surrounded
by others with whom we generally don't relate
to
our minds were born
in a context where we sought
the positive and reassuring
nurturing and encouraging
attentions of our parents
and this is true
whether we grew up with our actual parents
or there were other adults
who were
embodying those roles
our minds were born
from
the hope
of acquiring
the positive attention
that's
that's
the
that's the
that positive attention
is what directed
our faculties and intelligences
in the process of learning
to walk upright
or to manipulate
an object with our hand
to write, to draw, to speak
and understand language
and many of us suffered
terrible agonies as children
because instead of
the reassuring and common
presence of the positive attention
of our mother, father, grandmother, grandfather
brothers, sisters, siblings
we many of us got a lot of
critical and negative attention
and we internalized that
and this is part of how
the whole broken
of pain and judgment
and criticism and false accounting
you know, courtroom like situations
became prevalent
though even if we had
a relatively secure and
nurturing childhood
we're still going to eventually leave the nest
most of us and face the world outside
sometimes with
the support of others who love us
our actual parents or possibly
our alo parents
adults who
though they may not be
our genetic progenitors
fall in love with us
in the parental way
we take on the role of parents
as we grow
but it's very difficult
