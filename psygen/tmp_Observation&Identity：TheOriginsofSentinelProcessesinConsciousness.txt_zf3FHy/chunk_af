to navigate the modern world
without a social basis of support
encouragement, reassurance
positive attention
and there's no
simple answer
if we can form cohorts
together, little alo families
and such
then we have the opportunity
to give and receive
positive encouraging human attention
and that's a very healing medicine
and even if we're isolated and terrified
and broken and frightened
we still have the capacity
to redirect
the flows
because our thinking
is a bit like a behavior or a habit
and so we can slowly introduce something
new and good and nourishing
a little bit of time and practice it
and even if we're isolated
which I hope that we're not
but even when we are
we can learn
in a sense to begin to be loving parents
and siblings
and companions to ourselves
and after a lifetime of harm
in a mind that's disorganized by fear
and shame and anger
and threat
it's a very challenging thing
but it's still possible
to make a little bit of headway
to take tiny steps in this direction
and open up the compass
so that
even given
all of the challenges we might face
we can have some experience
of harmony
and self-care
and freedom from judgment and criticism
and accounting and courtroom
in our hearts and minds
as we walk through life
I myself have experienced
unimaginable isolation
things I never imagined possible
and I was lucky
for some of that time
in that
some of the really beautiful
and profound opportunities
of consciousness and creativity
and play and discovery
and learning
had been so well established
that it took a long, long time
for the isolation to wear through
those healthy membranes
but it does
it can
so I too suffer from the things I hear described
and they're very challenging
the fact that I can talk about them articulately
is helpful and useful
and in a way
you can think of this talk
not as me lecturing
about something I've mastered
but rather
as me
as an aspect of my awareness
reminding myself
of the nature of the troubles
their origins
and the directions toward opportunity
healing, growth
learning and freedom
thank you so much
for walking with me today
for your attention
for your kindness
for your humanity
and your interest in learning together
I'm deeply grateful
and I look forward
to learning again
very soon
bye bye for now
