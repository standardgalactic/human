harmony with our nature and our interiority because, yes, if you torture us, our nature expresses that and it gets ugly. But when we're not tortured and we're not fighting, humans are pretty peaceful in general.
At least we certainly have the potential to enjoy a piece that all of our ancestors dreamt of and worked for. And the investment of their lives and hearts and souls is something I will not dismiss ever for it's alive in me, in my own heart, in my own spirit.
I want for all human beings the chance for them to be human and have meaningful identities and roles and relationships in spite of the bizarre cultures we have, we find ourselves enmeshed in.
Well, now my walk has ended. I'm grateful for you joining me and I look forward to further conversations and discoveries. Thanks, everybody.
