and there's a lot of activity here
although at our scale at the macro scale the scale we live at
a lot of the activity is invisible
because it's happening in other temporalities at other speeds
so we do not see the very sophisticated and actually in its own way rapid growth
of the plants
what's happening in the plants is distributed
over a vast compared to to my body anyway a relatively vast
physical embodiment some of which
is invisible because it's under the ground
now these animals exist at close to our scale
so their temporality is intelligible to us
they don't they're not moving so quickly that they appear to be a blur
and they're not moving so slowly
that to us they appear to be still
so they are existing near our own temporality and yet
what comprises a lifespan for them
is very different what comprises from what comprises a lifespan in our understanding and expectation
now of course i think it's very important to carefully consider
that each living being
is unique and is distinct from our ideas about it
it's distinct from our expectations because most of our ideas and expectations come from norms
these are generalizations over classes of phenomena processes beings environments and so on
and these generalizations while useful
in some domains of our human thinking
and pragmatic or utilitarian orientations
these generalizations we use all the time in our thought and in our science
and in statistics and in making predictions and so on
can be extremely deceptive when we move from
the class of beings or phenomenon
to an instance an individual
this is a fascinating thing to remain aware of
and as a cognitive activist it's the kind of thing that i'm particularly interested in
what kind of thing do i mean i mean the difference between
our generalizations our norms
our expectations of phenomenon
and the actual uniqueness of a given being or situation or circumstance or question
when that question becomes about a specific array of related events
part of why it's fascinating is because the generalizations can be very deceptive
and what brought this to mind for me was the idea that we have a lifespan
that there's a unexpected span of life for an animal or human being
that span is generated from norms
and it's a generalization
some human beings die before they're born
some human beings die shortly after they are born
some human beings die in childhood some in their teens
so what we sort of mean by a lifespan in human terms is barring what we would consider to be misadventure
which is a strange word in and of itself since our life is
and our death we're so these things are so mysterious
it's very difficult to understand what would comprise misadventure
yet we have a normal meaning for this word
so every life every being every seed every bird every dog every bacterium
every form of life
while it resembles the class the generalization that we conceptually
apply to it and this is an overlay on our direct experience none of us can directly see bacteria
and we know these plants are growing
but they're doing it at a rate in a way that's not ordinarily detectable to us
technologies can render it detectable
and similarly with technologies we can see bacteria
we can also see into the development of processes and relationships that are otherwise ordinarily invisible to us
the expectation that things will be normal
is a very peculiar one and a dangerous one for many of us
that comes not only from language but from culture
and i have to admit that although i am a a biofile and an ethnophile
and i love diversity actually i love i just love
i love so many fascinating aspects of the living planet and world
and i'm even an anthrofile i love human beings
but i'm also
phobic about many aspects of our culture
our societies our technologies lots of these things i'm ambivalent about
meaning i have more than one feeling
so that while i can appreciate the seeming mechanical perfection of a smartphone or a jet fighter
i largely abhor their existence and automobiles and and so on and so forth
because to me they represent a vast misapprehension of the nature purposes and
necessities of living as a human being and being in the living world
relationally with integrity and awareness
so i'm conflicted
it's not necessarily it's not necessarily true that i'm hypocritical although it's relatively easy to see this
to see me this way because for example i'm using this device to communicate with you
to share in the life of the mind the soul and the imagination
i think here we probably have a coyote dig
though another animal conceivably a skunk or possibly a raccoon
could have made that dig
this is a buckeye that we might imagine is sleeping right now
we call it a buckeye because it produces
large seed bodies that resemble
could be understood to resemble the eye of a deer
and noticing that name answers a question for me
friend of mine and i ryan heavyhead were in the children's garden here a couple of weeks ago
and we found some things that resembled chestnuts
and we were we were curious about them
what they were and now just because of the name of that tree i think i know
the
i think i know what humans what humans around here call them
does that tell me what they are does knowing their name tell me what they are no
it links them to a couple of classes it links them to the class of something
a unique thing
things we can refer to in language and there are things that don't that aren't in that class
organisms vegetation trees seeds fruit
there's other ways we can classify them but you see that
to get to the concept or name or whatness of a thing in language we have to traverse a tree
that goes from everything to something to a class
to a subclass and so on
and
i can hear
and see a variety of avians birds having that word doesn't really help me know what they are
what happens is
well all kinds of different things happen with humans in language
there is no simple generalization for this but it's it's both very profound and sophisticated
and useful and at the same time very dangerous and confusing and blinding
our relationships with language and knowledge do not merely reveal
the facets of our experience to us they also hide them
beneath a veil of codes and representations and theories and ideas and concepts and noises
we can make with our face or write in letters with our hands
or our machines
so we have these these generalizations classes of things beings processes phenomenon ideas
tropes cliches
and we transmit them from generation to generation
each of us uniquely encounters
the manifold
of human representational consciousness in our lives and we each uniquely encounter
an experience and relate with the living world the universe the sky the seasons the sun the moon
stars ideas waking life dreaming life goals aspirations
suffering illness injury love anguish fear hatred
desire confusion isolation communion
and one of the reasons that norms are problematical for us is that
as human beings we're social animals
and there's an emotional interiority to each of us
that changes based on our situation and lifespan you know the span over the span of our lives
but but is highly responsive both to our perceived relationships with others
and our imagined possible relationships with others
and so we have most of us something often referred to as an inner critic
and the inner critic can be thought of as an amalgam
of the imagined thoughts perceptions and expectations not necessarily of actual others though those may
be included for example authorities in our childhood people who are important during our
development our parents our relatives our our siblings and so on but also imaginary others
also imaginary others possible others what would most people think
is an imaginal catalyst for the possibility of inner criticism and many of us struggle
with this so severely throughout our lifetimes that we are often in agony or misery or fear
or anxiety because we suspect
that something's wrong not so much necessarily
in our own interiority but in the relationship between our own interiority
and the expectations of authorized or critical others doctors judges parental figures and so on
and this is very tragic and painful for many of us and nearly all of us will experience
some degree of this suffering
where we will feel
where aspects of our own psyche will direct themselves against other aspects of our
native interiority our unique interiority
and focus painful judgments toward them
i've known people who suffer so severely from this that in conversation
they have to struggle to produce a sentence because critical reflections
are seething up from their subconscious and unconscious and conscious psyche
so that it it doesn't even seem reasonable or possible for them to emit language
that doesn't immediately invoke judgment
and again much of this judgment is imaginary
much of our fear in life is about things that aren't real that we'll never experience
or is comprised of reflections of previous experience that are no longer relevant
or relative to our current situation
and so the idea of norms generates in the human psyche
again i'm using a generalization there because this is going to be unique in every moment of every human
of every psyche if there even is such a thing as a psyche
and i'm getting near what i originally wanted to speak about but i'm
i'm approaching it in spirals at the moment
and there by the way is the gentle intrusion of my own critic
or my own critical concern i had a plan i'm not sticking to it
uh is my
is my oration properly organized and my disorganized
would someone else see this as disorganized would they be critical
am i pleased with the aspect of myself that determines whether or not what i am doing is being done well
now some of that's very useful because when it's gentle when it's when it's gently directed
that aspect of concern about for example i'll use the word quality the quality of my
activity or behavior or making creativity
when when the critic is gentle it both encourages me to proceed
and reveals to me
aspects of opportunity for me to improve
to make something that i already think is relatively good even better
now here we come to the fundamental division
which is between good and bad as if these were necessarily implicit
qualities associated with all possible reference but they're not
um once we learn to divide the world particularly conceptually
into good and bad we have a trap for the psyche for our intelligence for our emotions
for our for our narytmological consciousness the consciousness to tell stories
about what's going on in our lives
that one thing that one dichotomy good and bad is the source of much of our emotional and psychic
and mental anguish am i good or not is the fundamental question am i doing well or not
is the fundamental question around which the the the critical aspect of awareness
is orbiting the receptive aspect of awareness
and these two are reflecting back and forth in a relationship
as if there were a kind of psychic satellite
yeah but it's orbiting something what is that something
and we could say you know our identity our personality our being
our essence our mind our concern the last one is relatively good it's it's orbiting our concern
in a sense what we've become
momentarily compelled by our compulsion
but it can orbit other things like our inspiration our creativity
our humanity our masculinity our femininity
