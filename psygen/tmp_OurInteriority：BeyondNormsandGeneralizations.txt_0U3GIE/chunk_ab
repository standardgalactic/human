our intrinsic belongingness to the humans and norms or our otherness our aloneness
to humans and norms
so the idea of doing well
is generated the character of our experience of whether we are doing well or not at something
is generated by a vast array and maybe a multi-dimensional array
of historical experiences concerns habits
so that there's a there's a there's a degree of it that feels relatively
comfortable and useful and then there are degrees that feel wonderful
and ecstatic there are forms anyway if not degrees and there are degrees and forms that feel
miserable and agonizing and frightening
depersonating us so some positive evaluations and judgments and so on of our our our interiority
our being our self are encouraging and reassuring and if we are able to do something
of our our our interiority
our being our self are encouraging and reassuring and it's very joyful to share these together i
think it's important to remind each other to to be siblings to each other to be parents to each
other to be grandparents to each other when of course everyone agrees about this
to be kind and gentle and generous and beautiful siblings and peers and parents and teammates and
tribe mates and so on
but then there's the other side of that the side where we're motivated to criticize or attack
refute reject and i think this is where much of our turmoil comes from
we're many of us are rarely receiving healthy nurturing positive feedback
in the social and cultural world
and some number of us are are are sort of crippled in a way by
not even needing to be rejected by any particular external other we've interiorized
negatively oriented others and inside ourselves we have this this circle of
vicious critics and judges
that are imaginal
forms of what if what would other people think what would so and so think
of course most of the time
the vast majority of other people are not thinking about us
99.999 they're not thinking about us but we imagine what normal quote unquote people
would think and here's where the generalization gets weird because there really aren't any normal
people we might be able to say there's normative behavior we can observe normative behavior behavior
that sort of falls in the middle of the the range of possible behaviors but even that the idea
that that's normal or good is really worth questioning deeply yeah there's no reason to believe
that normative behavior is ordinary or good except that it matches a statistical gradient right
and even that statistical gradient can be misfounded because what we will derive from statistics as
normal will depend upon our concerns and purposes in producing data from in deriving data from
observation yeah and this is very important to understand this when we derive data from
observation we're collapsing incredibly complex phenomenon into a tiny amount of a relatively
modest little array of variables some of which we get wrong we being a really weird generalization
what i mean is analysts right people doing the analysis
so once again we can see that the generalization is weird and if it weren't weird if our generalizations
were actually good we'd be able to really accurately predict what would happen to an individual
not to a group which is what statistics applies to primarily but to an individual
and this is where perhaps i will begin to speak a little bit i have to consider it now i've
i've established a path accidentally today that i wasn't intending to and now i have to decide
whether i should continue along the path that i'm on
or switch to the path i had planned
and i don't know what to do
so
i'm going to circle back to the beginning to where i began speaking and just notice
that the actual life experience of a given organism is wildly unpredictable
the fact that a human egg can be fertilized does not mean it will be born the fact that it is born
does not mean it will survive the fact that it survives birth does not mean it will survive
its first year its second the first day of its second year so on so forth we don't know
there's an incredible
profusion of mystery about every aspect of existence and identity
to be born as a human being
is a very it is a situation fraught with mystery opportunity
to be
suffering
all of the features
of existence
that we are all uniquely familiar with
and we have these ideas about norms
but when you look
those are those are clusters
those are clusters within a storm
incredible diversity
and i think we should be able to flip our perspective over
so that that diversity has precedence
right if we do that suddenly the critics are voiceless
for they know nothing of diversity
most of them they are the produce of the idea that things should match norms
by the way the things should
as if there's some extrinsic authority imposing form on phenomenon
and when form escape that imposition they're bad or wrong
and one of the things that's really interesting about whether something is good or bad
is that this idea which is one of the most dangerous ideas we'll ever encounter
and one could argue that
one of the fundamental problems for human consciousness is framed
in the story in our in the english bible
of genesis and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
apparently everything was pretty going pretty well
until at some point
one of the original gender pair of human beings
approached a very special tree
that they apparently had been admonished
to neither approach nor touch nor eat from
now this is a very complex story and it's a story that i'll save most of my
exploration of for another time
but this tree is supposed to be in the midst of the garden of eden
and that midst kind of means in the between
it's in the between of all things
yeah and if you go into the between of all things and you make a cut
and you say these things are on that side of the cut these other things are on this side of the cut
this side is good that side is evil well now you're in boy are you in trouble you're in a problem
now ordinarily we are trained to evaluate phenomena
whether they are good or not a lot by feelings does it feel good does it not feel good
does it hurt does it help is it nourishing is it toxic
is it gentle is it harsh
do you feel more alive or do you feel like you're being killed
and all of these criteria are relatively natural to our minds and humanity
and yet there's a problem with good and evil for human beings
and the problem is really significant and important if we want
if we want to understand something fundamental about the nature of good and evil
if we want to clarify a bit this ancient problem for us
and by the way after we discover good and evil things go all wonky for human beings
according to you know this story in the bible which is probably actually a fragment
of a really ancient story and there's lots of reflections of very similar stories
in indigenous cultures that had nothing to do with the bible at all
though not all cultures have a story about the introduction of good and evil
many of them i have heard stories like this many of them i have not
i have not heard stories like this
but one of the most profound features of this conflict
the hawks are harass i think the excuse me the crows and ravens are harassing hawk
and the camera probably won't reveal this very well
but this is this is almost a perfect trope
the black corvids appear to have
decided that the brown raptor is bad
or at least shouldn't be allowed to just be where it is although it was a brief harassment
and they left pretty quick and there's some other crows and ravens around
who they have alerted about the the location of the hawk probably a red tail
but then they just kind of went off to do their own thing
that probably means that i mean there's lots of things it could possibly mean millions of them
but one of the ways that i think about what i just witnessed is that the specific location
of the hawk is not particularly a problem it's not in one of their roost trees it's not in a tree
that's in their territory so to speak or territory they understand to be but they should be protective of
and so really they primarily let the hawk know that we know you're there
and they let each other know that there's a hawk nearby and then they kind of went on to do whatever
they needed to do i've seen this behavior many times
so one of the fundamental features of the good and evil dichotomy
something that we don't usually think of
when trying to understand whether some we you know whether we perceive something as good or evil
good or bad so on so forth is time
most of us i i suspect there's a vast generalization there i met very very few people who would claim
or could demonstrate that they can see into time time is the dimension in which our
perception is extremely limited it's limited to right now
there are as as you go forward from right now presuming that there's a forward and backward in time
which i think probably is deceptive but it's it's a natural result of our common orientation
and thinking about time
and i do believe that it's possible for human beings to to see into time the way we see into space
i can see what is ahead of me right now if i continue on this path but if i turn
what is ahead of me changes yeah so whichever direction i turn in determines what is ahead
and there must be some corollary to this peculiarity in our relationship with time
i think and i suspect it's possible for human beings to see into time i also suspect it's very
dangerous for a number of reasons that i won't hear elaborate on one of which i'll mention
is that it can generate feedback of a peculiar kind that can be very difficult to handle cognitively
but because we can't see into time it's very difficult to tell whether an event is good or bad
we can tell in the moment that we don't like it or that we would not want it to happen
we would not choose it this way we would not like it but we can't tell what the
sequelae what the consequences will be for anything that we judge is good or bad
at least in only a very small subset of cases that we don't like
small subset of cases is it likely that we can determine whether something is fundamentally good or bad
and again good is associated with life giving bad is associated with life removing right
in general
so because we cannot see into time we cannot tell what the ontological outcomes of an event are
surely i do not wish to be injured yet if i am injured it changes my life path
and every you know we most of us many of us drive drive vehicles and at least in the united
states we because we drive vehicles we are subject to traffic signals every one of those changes
where we will be at what time in the future one could imagine that our lives are actually
composed by our relationships with traffic signals if one were so disposed
and it's not entirely untrue it's just not the only thing going on but certainly a very weird and important one because
if my parents had not been subject to the very specific traffic signals that they were subject to
it's very difficult to imagine them meeting right so am i the result of the activity of my parents
interactions with traffic signals it's hard to say no but that's not the only variable
it's just a really important one and i find that a kind of terrifying thought right it's not only
terrifying we can choose our orientation and our purpose in examining it but it's a really weird idea
the traffic signals determine who who gets which eggs get fertilized and by whom and so on
and human beings right i once wrote a with a friend of mine gary paulini i once wrote we together composed this story about a man who had noticed this phenomenon and and used to go to the traffic signal every day to read the future
it was called traffic signal man and it was composed we improvised the composition over about an hour and recorded it and i think there's actually a recording of it somewhere on a cassette tape in my in my special cassette box
we are particularly susceptible to signals i can hear the signal of a machine
there you see once the signal was established and began rhythmically reproducing i expected it to continue
the moment that i noticed it it disappeared
is that good is it bad i don't like that signal i'm not partial to having
the noises and effects of machines intrude upon my my senses my sensorium i don't like them i'm a
canofobic in that sense and i'd like to avoid them in general but there are exceptions so our machines bad
we make evaluations primarily based on habits okay another similar signal by the way those are both the signals of car alarms right
so someone's machine is in a state where it's been programmed to produce an alarm because it has been disturbed the idea being that the alarm will drive off thieves and alert others who might be protective of the machine
when i first moved to san francisco it was extremely common to be awakened at two three four five in the morning
by car alarms not just one many of them just going off and going off and going off
and that was bad
now it could be that there were results of that happening
that were important
i can't tell for sure
the knowledge of good and evil is at best incomplete but we should be aware
we should be aware
we should be aware that because we cannot see into time
so
determining whether a specific thing is good or bad
is profoundly difficult if not impossible
that doesn't mean that the local the temporally local felt sense of goodness or badness should be doubted
but the intrinsic sense should be questioned in many cases
i think it's useful we know for example placing placing food in my mouth i can tell is it too hot is it hurting me
immediately that's a felt sense of if it's too hot
that's a felt sense of i need to change my relationship i might have to spit the food out and if it's not hot enough
that could also represent a problem if i choose to approach it that way
it's very complex but i do want us to be aware that the intrinsic sense of goodness is that it's very complex
intrinsic goodness or badness of some specific event is probably a myth
