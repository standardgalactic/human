we can't tell because we can't see the future we can't see with the sequelae we can't see the consequences
and something that initially seems bad something we would absolutely avoid
could turn out to be profoundly fortunate
this same bird was in this same place
yesterday eating worms at right around this same time
had the car alarm not continued if the car alarm had not continued
i would have been on a different path and i would not have seen this bird here today
it's hunting worms because the worms are easily available in the very moist
grass but it could be eating other things as well not merely worms
i think the it's clear that the grass is moist
because the bird
is shaking its face
when
how close will it let the humans approach not terribly although much closer than i thought
had the the car alarm not continued i'd have been on another path
and eventually i became concerned because i don't want to disturb those people who are
watching my video with two or three minutes of blaring car alarm
so i changed my path but right when i changed my path
the car whose alarm was going off began to move previously had not been moving
so someone was driving a car whose alarm was going off
and just as i changed my path the origin of the alarm began to move
and soon departed my proximity none of this was predictable to me
was it normal
well we'd have to survey a whole bunch of car alarm situations to determine that question but
then what we would find out would be about the cluster qualities of clusters rather than the
specific situation was it good or bad again the specific situation and the cluster
revealed different
windows into
whether it was a positive thing or a negative thing and our orientation
in thought and and felt sense and perspective and purpose
are crucially important
in the process
of making a determination
for those of us who have an experience very troubling inner criticism
um
we may have learned to expect cruel or depersonating painful judgment
from someone or some organization whom we needed
to have a positive relationship with in order to be healthy
and eventually when this goes on long enough or if it starts early enough in our lives
we begin to mirror it
in the sense that we form inward psychic organs that take on this role
and that can be tragic and painful and vicious similarly when we are positively when we receive
positive feedback and evaluation and praise and reassurance and inspiration we may similarly
form psychic organs that produce that feedback even in the absence of their existence in our
external world and relationships
i was largely lucky enough to be in the latter group though
we all will undergo transformations in these aspects of our interiority as we
proceed through our lifespan and into and out of new relationships
social opportunity and isolation and so on and so forth
analysts are generally concerned with norms
they want to know what is common what is uncommon
and maybe even get some numbers about that but when they get those numbers
their concerns and purposes will determine
what statistics they derive
what elements they examine how they examine those elements so on and so forth
so perspective and orientation
are not just involved in determining what is good or bad
but also what we think of as true normal or reasonable to expect
when we become aware of this consciously when we when we become consciously aware of the things
i've been circling then we have new opportunities to see through the blinding aspects of our
representational heritage in language and concepts and models and methods expectations norms
generalizations once we can see through that our consciousness rises above it in precedence
and that's really important because in that moment we cease to be merely subject to
the results of all of this behavior over human time and history and we can now
be selective intentionally consciously creatively in our interiority
in our inner selves and in our relationships we can become selective
about those features that we would like to include and those features that we would like to
reduce the precedence of the authority of we can decide
which aspects we want
to catalyze in our awareness and which and fertilize and pursue and which aspects we'd like to
we or we might be better off
allowing to drop away or to fall away or seeing for what they are right that these are not it's not
true that i am bad simply because there's some echoey voice of a mean authority in my mind
that's calling me names or judging me
i can let i can stop feeding that cycle of the produces that signal
or i can turn right i can reorient in such a way that that signal is not in front of me
but behind me it's gone it's going away
and i think we would all prefer
to have the clarity of insight that arises when we move
our minds and and our sense of personhood and our interiority
above all of these abstractions and generalizations and possible judgments of possible others
or possible societies imaginary critics
though on the other hand as i move the camera to my other hand
we might want to encourage and fertilize the voices in our interiority that are
positive and reassuring praising and
purpose whose purposes we trust to be good and true
healthful and wholesome
even bearing in mind that the acute division between good and evil good and bad
is deceptive because we can't see into time even bearing that in mind nonetheless
right now
not that hot and cold necessarily represent good and evil essentially in that model what i'm saying
is that extreme sudden extreme changes are very difficult to for organisms like us
in the temporalities we exist in in the temporalities native to our
to our consciousness and our and our size and our form and such
sudden radical transformations usually experienced as danger although not always
some of them are desirable
and in fact if the food is too hot suddenly in my mouth
the sudden radical transformation of getting it out of my mouth is important
when i first entered the garden it struck me
i had an entirely different topic in mind
but i was looking at the trees and it struck me that they're deeply rooted in the earth
in the in what we might imagine is the material the material the prime prima
materia of the world soil but their branches many of their branches are
way up in the sky in the domain we associate with origin and spirit
and even the non-physical and that was related to the topic i originally had planned to explore today
and it's entirely acceptable to me that i i didn't get anywhere near it
but the garden here is beautiful
and i have greatly enjoyed exploring
these ideas and perspectives with you today
and i'm profoundly grateful for those of you who have chosen to walk with me in your thoughts
and time in your life given the gift of your attention
and i would love to hear your comments suggestions ideas concerns questions
so please feel free to chime in
even though i realized that in our modern context of
short attention span theater sast very few of you will probably ever get near the end of this video
nonetheless i'm grateful thank you for joining me and i look forward to exploring
some of the fascinating depths of our humanity
our conceptual heritage and the non-verbally capturable essences
that are deeply associated with our minds and being in the world
bye bye for now
you
