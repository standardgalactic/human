We don't need those noises. What we need is the senses.
And this is part of what I meant by no one will describe the path to you in such a way that it will open for you.
It's like a mission or a quest, right? Or a puzzle. You have to resolve it personally.
And by resolve, I don't mean finish. I mean proceed. Make some progress, something like this.
So these are my thoughts for the evening on my night walk.
And I'm very grateful for those of you who listen.
I wish you every blessing of origin, of life, of the living places, of the animals, of the season, the plants, all the living beings.
May your path be deep and beautiful, your life long and prosperous.
Bye-bye for now. Hope to see you again soon.
