So, you know, one time I came in with wearing a pants that were kind of low, right?
Kind of African style, right?
And they're called trugu and gana.
And I wore that and I wore an African flag tie.
But just the colors, not no flags.
Right.
And I did a sermon.
And after I was called down and confronted with the elders that was inappropriate, and
I wanted to ask why.
They said, well, it's, you know, it's against our regulations and blah, blah, blah.
And it was like, I don't know.
You're not speaking clearly to me as to why it's wrong.
You're not telling me why it's wrong.
Yeah, you're just saying essentially because I said so.
Yeah, yeah.
Right.
And that really irritated me.
So I started asking more questions, not at that time, because usually when I'm confronted
like that, I'm in shock and almost teary-eyed and, you know, trying to understand what's
going on, especially when I was young.
And, but I came back eventually and I asked them a question I wanted to know.
I mean, he had navels, you know, and when they got, they started accusing me of apostasy
for asking those kind of questions.
And that's when I decided, you know, this is not working out.
So even though I stayed with the religion a couple more years after that, I think it
was maybe 25 or 26 by the time I left it.
Well, it becomes so important in your life, right?
Yeah.
Because there's a high social coherence and there's something that resembles a community
and people's at least pretending to take care of each other and all of this kind of stuff
where outside the religion, it's very difficult.
Empty.
And I have those very important features of our lives.
I'm with you.
So a couple of years you kept going.
Yeah.
Outside of the religion, they call it the gnashing of the teeth in the darkness.
You're outside looking in the window, gnashing your teeth because you're cold, right?
Yeah, we're terrified.
Yeah.
It's a biblical scripture, but they use it with themselves that way.
And, you know, I just, everybody I knew that was my friend was a Jehovah's Witness.
Right.
And everybody that wasn't that I knew, I never associated with them.
So I didn't know how to make that cross-pollinization until I became a machinist in New Hampshire.
And I started meeting some crazy people like, you know, car mechanics, you know, like Corvettes
and stuff like that.
Yeah.
And that's when I started realizing, you know, there's other parts of the world besides
the Bible and dogma.
It's like, I can, you know, get into hot rods, you know, things like that and airplanes.
Yes.
You know, so I really started expanding at that point.
And along with that, my attitude started changing as to what I needed to conform to because
it had to make sense.
And literally, that's what drove me to Africa was trying to find what is the source of humanity?
What is the source of our religion and our science?
Is it there or is it not there?
You know, how does it make sense to me?
You know, it was weird when I actually went to Africa.
They never considered me to, they would say it.
Oh, yeah, you're African.
You're one of our brothers, right?
But no, because once I started learning the language, I understood what they were saying.
Wow.
Yes.
You know, they would still call me a half white.
White black is really what it means.
White black.
White first.
Yeah, white first.
Yeah.
Exactly.
And totally understandable.
My mentor.
You were American.
I was American.
Yeah.
But more than that.
More than that.
Because my mentor, when he left Burkina Faso and went to Europe and came back, he was born
and raised there.
Pure blooded African.
He left and came back.
They wouldn't, the village wouldn't take him back because of his influence.
They called him Asada as well.
So it's not even just, it's not, it's not the culture or the skin or anything.
It has to do with your village and your, you know.
If you don't have a place, where are you, there's no land that is where you are from.
Yeah.
Right?
You're not from this land where we live.
Right.
This village where we live.
Yes.
And our parents and great grandparents and everybody are buried here.
Yeah.
And the forest is over there and the mountain is over there and the river is over there.
Where, you know.
And those rivers and mountains are integral with the ancestors.
So when they say la terra, you know, I'm going to call upon the power of la terra.
They're talking about the earth.
They're talking about their ancestors that are in that earth, in the water, in nature and
trees and mountains.
Yes.
They're talking about the soil.
Yeah.
And it doesn't mean that, okay, well, my grandfather's marriage here, so now there's power.
No, there's probably, you know, tens of thousands of years, hundreds of thousands of years of
power developing in that, from those people in that one spot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Focus.
That's what makes a difference.
Over time.
A mountain of power is there because of all the time.
For them.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's why I never understood African Americans because it's like, we want it, and I did the
same thing, you know, we want to adopt into Oshu and all these different things, you know.
But they're, they're, they're, those are ancestors of the other people, other villages.
You know, we can't just like, oh, this is African, so it's us.
Yeah.
Yes.
It's the same.
Yeah.
The word escapes me.
Capturing the cultural milieu and language and so on of other people, right?
The same problem.
Yeah.
Yeah.
It's a limit to what you can do with that.
Okay.
So you're 26, you're leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses and you, you start working on cars
and you, you realize like, oh, this is the Southern world.
Yeah.
Working in a body shop.
Working in a body shop.
Yeah.
Working on engines.
Yeah.
Working as a mechanic.
Yeah.
And where was that going on?
New Hampshire.
Well, Massachusetts, I swear, right after high school.
My, my high school was a vocational high school.
Ah, yeah.
So I graduated as a car mechanic.
Copy.
Yeah.
And then, so I, you know, first guy I worked for was a Jehovah's Witness.
Had a beautiful wife, had a beautiful business.
I think he was cheating on her.
So that fell apart.
And I'm not surprised because I had to quit the job because this old lady came in to get
her car repaired.
And back in the seventies, rust would eat away all the metal around, around the fenders
and things like that.
Right.
So she needed this stuff repaired.
He had me filling it with newspaper and then putting Bondo kind of, some kind of tape over
it and then Bondo over it.
And then it's like, I can't do that.
I just can't, I couldn't do it.
I wasn't able to do it.
I had to leave.
Do you mean you couldn't do it ethically?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I just couldn't.
It's just a bad, you feel bad about doing this kind of fake, fake repair.
I didn't understand it.
I couldn't understand it.
And you know, at the time I wasn't suffering.
I was still living at home.
You know, I was right after high school, you know.
Yeah.
So back to when you're 26.
Yeah.
What are some of your first introductions to the road, the road that you would then follow?
Probably one of the primary one.
Okay.
So I did get married before I was 26.
I got married because I had sex before marriage and the elders told me I had to get married
or else I wouldn't speak to my mother ever again or my sister or anyone else in my family.
Oh my gosh.
Yeah.
And then, you know, I think six months later we filed for divorce.
You know, she was 10 years older than me with three kids, right?
I already had a life, had a house, everything.
And just, you know, that wasn't for me.
Yeah.
Sure.
Yeah.
So I left that and then by the time I was 26, I met another girl.
