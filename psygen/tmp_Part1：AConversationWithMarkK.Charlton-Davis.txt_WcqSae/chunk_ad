Any tree.
Right.
You can go.
Yeah.
When my friend was in South America talking to an indigenous medicine man there in a little
village, medicine man said, oh, you know, back in the United States, you guys have this
thing, the internet, you know, but we have something way better than that.
Yeah.
Right.
And I think, you know, it's hard for moderns to understand this, but it's a very important
principle.
And I think you hope we could teach our children that everyone should understand.
Yeah.
The nature is traveling.
Yeah.
And it's a traveling family of networks.
Right.
And you can.
Yes.
Yeah.
All right.
So you encounter Molly Doma.
What happens next?
Yeah.
So one of the other things, the experiences that he had that I related to is the grandfather
having the souls of people that had passed away in little gourds up in the ceiling, you
know, hanging from the ceiling on ropes, little gourds of spirits and stuff.
I completely understood that because when we left California, you know, we got on the
plane rushing, you know, I was, I was trying to dress like Michael Jackson.
So I had a gold bell bottom pants.
My afro was out.
I was trying to look like Michael Jackson, but we led it in South Carolina.
The first time on a plane, watching the sun go down, seeing it as I was landing.
And I was got a chance to meet my grandfather.
We had 83 acres of land.
He lived on one end.
My grandmother lived on the other.
But he lived with his mom out in the middle of the woods, out in the middle of nowhere.
And so once in a while, I'd get brave enough because it was hard because there was always
escaped convicts.
So you always heard hound dogs and police.
You know, going through.
So I was always afraid to go out there and afraid to go back, you know, but I did it.
And made a bow and arrow out of pine branches and stuff like that.
Thought that would help.
But I got to see my grandfather and I was so afraid to go in, but I could see he had cans
hanging from the ceiling, you know, because he was the local root doctor.
Oh, okay.
Yeah.
And even though my mom.
Is she your mother's dad?
My mother's dad.
Okay.
What was his name?
Jasper.
Jasper James.
Yeah.
He won the, what do you call it, festival every year for vegetables and, you know, fruit.
For having the largest, like, squash and watermelon, you know, he would win those contests every
year.
And he was getting help.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, he had a lot of science around it, you know.
And he worked as a full-time, full-time at Seasonal, but it was full-time for Barnum
Daly as a magician.
Really?
Yeah.
What an interesting combination.
Yeah.
Root doctor and magician and farmer.
Yeah.
And husband and grandfather.
Yeah.
As far as I know, that's it.
I don't know of any other skills that he had.
Wow.
A magician.
Yeah.
That's so ironic.
Yeah.
Right?
Because he's doing probably the phony stuff.
Yeah.
For the circus.
Yeah.
And then the real stuff for the home.
It had to be secret because of the Christianity.
Of course.
Yeah.
Huh.
Yeah, follow.
Yeah.
Okay, so you get to meet him.
Yeah.
What happens?
Yeah, he was, you know...
I mean, does he talk to you about anything?
No.
Not at all.
Oh, I see.
Yeah.
No.
I was amazingly afraid of him.
He was a...
My mom was super tall.
I think she was only 6'1", but as a little kid, just, you know...
Yeah, towering.
Yeah.
He was way taller than her.
Right now.
And he had ice blue eyes, you know.
Ice, like, silver blue lives, you know.
Wow.
Yeah.
So it dark-skinned.
A dark, dark, black-skinned.
So I don't know what to say about him.
He was shockingly interesting.
I wish I could have learned more, everything about him, but I never got the opportunity
to meet him a couple times.
Yeah.
But you saw the cans.
Yeah, I saw the cans.
And he had everything in his house covered with white sheets.
Well, you do that religiously, especially with African religions.
You do that, especially during certain ceremonies.
Everything's covered, you know.
The mirrors are covered.
Everything's covered.
Yeah.
Why is that?
It's like...
I'm not quite sure, but I always understood it to be...
It's like you want the spirits to not see themselves when they come to visit.
Yeah.
But that's kind of how I understood it.
Yes, that makes sense.
Yes.
But yeah, so after that, I'd go near his house, I'd look at it from a distance, and I would
try to ride a con and stuff like that around his place, but I never went there again.
He was a slave.
I mean, sorry.
He was born under indentured slavery, indentured servitude.
He ate out of the pig trough growing up as a kid, with other kids.
They would all eat out of the pig trough.
They were indentured servants?
Yeah.
Where do you know?
South Carolina.
Yeah.
Wow.
In, like, what?
The 30s?
The 20s?
My mother was born in 37.
Okay.
So maybe the 20s or the 10s?
Yeah.
What did it, what do you know about the indentured servants and their, like, why, how did they
become indentured?
What was going on?
Yeah.
I don't know much about it, other than that a lot of it has to do with debt.
Ah, yes.
Yeah.
Right.
And unfair business practices.
Yeah.
I mean, you passed on family to family.
Yeah.
You're just born into slavery because your parents have money or something.
And he had a lot of land.
Everybody wanted that land.
It was right on Highway 20.
Wow.
They finally ended up getting it.
Yeah, but it was, it was prime land.
All right.
We'll take a little break here and then we will return.
You okay?
I'm good.
Yeah, thank you.
