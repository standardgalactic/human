thick and warm that the humans will hunt you for those robes.
Yep.
So what he's giving to the humans is the capacity to wear the
robes of the other animals in a way.
Yeah.
Well, he's, he's giving them a very long winter.
Oh, yeah.
But he's given everybody a long winter.
I see.
And the frog is the one that hops between the seasons.
You know, when it comes to the moons, there's a, there's a
there's a Blackfoot moon called Metsi, Kapisaki, some, the
frog moon.
And that's the one that it's either a winter or summer moon
depending on whether it's a leap year and it will leap into
the summer if it's a, if it's a leap year, the leap year, the
leap, the extra moon, the 13 moon always comes in the winter.
As far as I've come to know.
Between two specific other moons.
What's that?
Between two specific other moons.
Yes.
Well, the frog is always where, where he is.
He's between.
Yeah.
It's between Saaki, some, the duck moon.
Mm hmm.
And Apiskitsa, the flower moon.
Ah.
Um, that's where the frog will be.
That's when the frogs mate.
A lot of the, you know, all of the stuff around the beaver bundle
has to do with the mating time.
A lot of it.
Yeah.
That's it.
That's the recreation.
Yeah.
Okay.
I have a question.
Yep.
What did the humans give?
The humans gave a scalp.
You want to hear the human story?
Yes, please.
All right.
Because all of the animals,
they're giving a whole library to the humans.
Yeah.
Making a treaty with them.
And what do the humans contribute?
And what is the agreement?
Mm hmm.
This is what I want.
All right.
Okay.
We'll get back to match, but this stuff's important.
Yep.
There are.
Two different.
Human contributions into the beaver bundle.
Both of them are scalps.
One of them comes from.
The.
Scabby round robes story.
But the scalp is not really the important thing that comes from
that story.
So I'm not going to tell that story,
even though that's one of the scalps that you'll find in the beaver
bundle.
And some other stuff from scabby round robes as well.
This is, this is another whole, like.
Another, a big story that happened.
That brought a whole bunch of news things into the beaver bundle.
There's several in, you know, you can imagine thousands of years of
history.
How many times your main corpus has to change.
And have, you know, resolution.
There are like,
over those thousand years where there's something very core that is
transferred.
Yeah.
Or included.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So.
Scabby round robe is one of these stories that some of that stuff
comes from.
So some beaver bundles have scalps in them associated with scabby
round robe.
There's a, there's a other scalp in there.
In some of the bundles.
And, and Mahoney in my bundle has this scalp.
And it comes from a story about.
So pistol book.
Owl child.
Who is a big gunny.
One of the Blackfoot tribes is be is called be gunny.
That was his tribe.
He had this dream.
This is way, way back.
You know,
I don't, I don't even want to try to imagine what,
how many years ago or whatever.
But he had a dream.
That.
Him and his.
His, you know, close brothers and cousins and stuff.
Went and really.
Super successfully raided.
Their southern neighbor.
The petiques in that ones.
The snake people.
The show.
And.
So.
He convinced his brothers and cousins, let's do this.
Let's go down there.
I know it's going to be like, we're going to,
we're going to come home so rich.
We're going to steal all their, all their stuff.
We're going to get all these, you know,
Valor's and stuff. Let's go do this.
So they all start following him.
They pack up and they're going on a, on a,
on a multi day.
Mission to go down there and try to actualize the stream.
But.
Every time they sleep and they travel mostly at night.
Hey.
When they're going on these raids, they travel at night.
And they sleep in the day in the, in the, like.
Usually in the, in the thickets.
You know, find some coolly with.
Like really close.
Choke cherries are down by the river.
With willow close willow and stuff.
And you, and you just sleep during the day and keep cover.
And then travel by night.
And then you're going to, you know,
make your way to the enemy.
And then.
Or to, I don't know, it's not even enemy in black foot.
It's more like opponent.
Cause all like the language is all in gaming.
And there was a system.
There was a, there was a system, a point system.
Which I don't, I don't have all in my head.
But killing people was low on the point system.
Yeah.
And the point system is taking away, you know,
vital resources.
You know, take away,
is what they call a coup in black foot,
but that's literally acquiring a gun.
Yeah.
Taking their, taking their, their,
what, you know, whatever that is,
whether it was a bow before and whatever,
taking their weapon, you know,
taking their stuff that they use to.
To retaliate against you and to hunt. Like it's all,
like back then it's all very utilitarian too.
You know, because.
The more.
You know, the more resources he got.
The bigger guy you were, like,
especially once the horses came in, hey,
horses really changed everything.
I think this story is like way pre-horse though.
It's certainly pre-gun by a long shot.
Yeah.
Yeah.
So anyway,
these guys are going down south to,
to raid their enemy,
to raid their opponent,
the snake people.
And every time they sleep,
the brothers, the cousins and stuff,
they start having their own dreams.
And their dreams
aren't as nice.
They're fearful dreams.
They see themselves dying.
They see bad things happen, you know,
or they see, you know, they're scared
when they wake up from their dreams and.
So pretty soon, like, you know,
a couple of days in, people start
turning back.
They're not, they're not going to participate, you know,
and his closest cousins and brothers stick with him further.
But eventually them too, they're just,
they're all having dreams that are ominous and bad, you know.
And they, they're like, hey, man,
like we want to trust your dream and everything,
but like we got trust ours too.
And so,
so they back off.
