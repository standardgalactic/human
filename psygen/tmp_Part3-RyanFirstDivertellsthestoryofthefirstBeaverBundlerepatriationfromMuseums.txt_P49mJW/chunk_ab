They're gonna alert you
They're gonna get between you and the danger
And that's that's what he gave
and that was when
Matoyapi
Said that
He had got
What was needed
And he agreed to the to the treaty
And he would share with the humans what they'd you know what had gone on
And he would change his name from Matoyapi
To not don't see an EP
The Sun came down
Brings brings down the Sun
Basic yeah
Not don't see an EP which
Became another famous name for beaver men
Now
Alan my my my elders
Grandfather was
One of the what was the last
That I know not don't see an EP the last brings down the Sun
But he won't be the last there'll be there'll be others
So that's what the humans gave to the bundle
That's that's that's kind of like that's a that's
More than I expected to talk about
What a bundle is but you have any questions
I was trying to tell a Harvard story
I know we're gonna get back to Matt
But um
The human gave
The beaver pup back
The human gave the beaver pup back the human gave
The human gave
Uh
Like
And that goat sees
Like mutual respect
Before this is a guy who his whole operation his whole life
Had been
I'm finding the fanciest looking animals
Killing them
Preparing their skins
And
You know selling it to people trading it bartering and stuff
Like all he was was a it was a it was a killing machine
And very inserted into
The natural world
And it wasn't
You know for food
It was just for things like robes and stuff you know
No
Just for getting the fanciest
You know the albinos and the mixed
Color patterns and different animals and things
You know
That's what he was known for
He he was
The trapper extraordinaire
That was the original beaver man
And he gave the pup
And he gave respect
What about the contributions of the sun and moon these are not his contributions
Nope
Those come in on this
Those were those were things he was waiting for he was right those came in on the side of what the animals would offer to him
Right
Okay
So the pop and mutual respect
Which isn't minor not trivial anything else
No
That's basically that's basically it the mutual respect is the big thing the pup is just a symbol just like his just like his son
Who is not able to feed without his mom
Keeping the beaver pup from his parents is is endangering the future generations
Yeah
This is what we're talking about
Yes
Yes
They're just symbols
Future generations
Yes yes yes the children
Yeah
So in order to save the children the future generations we must agree to have a mutual respect where we can coexist
Yes
Us with the animals
And the mainstream culture today does not have that
It's more than that though too unless I don't understand something or I'm making something out
Can I go on a tangent?
Yes
A little one
I work with rattlesnakes
That's a that's a that's probably a
Out of my income my annual income
Probably
A tenth of it comes from
Wrangling rattlesnakes
In the heart of Blackfoot territory in Lethbridge where I live this is like this is like the nexus of this is you know
This is the heart of Blackfoot territory and there's a huge rattlesnake population prayer rattlesnakes and I'm the guy
That gets called when a rattlesnake shows up
In somebody's yard and the human being
Need something to be done about it
You know like you're not allowed here to kill snakes it's against the law
I know in the states you're still allowed to kill snakes
Almost everywhere
Here in Alberta where I live
You are not allowed to kill any of our natural snake species you will get up to a thirty thousand dollar fine in five years in prison
Wow
It's it's a it's a criminal offense
So given that you're not allowed to kill a snake if you can't just coexist with one
Real easy then you end up calling the rattlesnake guy and that's me I took on that position
Because I've been around snakes on my life
But also because of the beaver bundle because I thought this was a way to kind of honor
My role as a beaver man and the rattlesnakes this is why I want to go on this tangent the rattlesnakes I find are the
Best symbol in my mind of that treaty that was made
Yes, yes, I know where you're going and please keep going there
With the beaver bundle
Yes
With white grass
Why are they the best symbol?
Because there are venomous snakes all over the earth
But only here
In the Americas do you find this thing called a rattlesnake
And a rattlesnake co-evolved with human presence here
It's a it's not a it's not an old old thing having having rattles on a snake
It's something that coin co-evolved with humans
And
I think, you know, if it was a situation where
Cultures demonized so to speak the snakes like the main
Not even so to speak just straight up demonize them
Well, yeah, well obviously Christian culture does
But there's other there's others cultures that just are snake haters
But don't necessarily demonize them. They're just like because they don't have rattlesnakes
They have these other snakes to just fight them with no warning
Right. We have rattlesnakes. Why do we have rattlesnakes?
Because we agreed to coexist with the animals
In all of the animals including the rattlesnakes
There's no way that rattle evolves in a cultural situation with humans
They're going to respond negatively to that rattle and just kill the snake
When they're warned
That rattle only evolves if it has the effect that it needs to have
Which is to say leave me alone and people, you know back off
That doesn't happen everywhere else in the world because everywhere else in the world they don't have this agreement
Maybe, you know
Yeah
Let me rephrase what you said
And now
You know, we've had hundreds of years now of a different cultural influence here in the Americas
And we are starting to see pockets of rattlesnakes that are changing
There's a Mojave rattlesnake
Where a lot of the young snakes are being born with a crooked tail that can't rattle
And there are prairie rattlesnakes, the same species that are here in black
There are prairie rattlesnakes, the same species that are here in blackfoot territory
Just a couple provinces east of here in Manitoba, there's a pocket of prairie rattlesnakes
Where the newborns are being born without a nub to form a rattle on
And herpetologists do believe that this is because of the persecution of the rattlesnake
Of the snake in general
And that, you know, now having the rattle is evolutionarily or natural selection wise
Not a good thing here because of the cultural system of the humans
In other words, so the rattle where it doesn't warn the humans off successfully goes away
Yeah, I mean, if the rattle goes off and people say, oh, there's a snake there, kill it
Then the rattle goes away
Yeah, over time
Yeah, over time, that's the way natural selection works
Blackfoot knowledge is very aligned with some of the core mainstream science and ecology knowledge too
And natural selection is not a, you know, it all plays in there
I think that's why we have the rattlesnakes here is because natural selection playing into a eco-social situation, a context where there's an agreement
We're not just going to kill something just because it's here, you know, just because it shows up
There are Blackfoot protocols around, like if a bird enters into your house, it flies in on its own kind of thing
People would kill it
And
I think that's just because of the, you know, the situation with, if you're living in a teepee, which is always open, it's never, never entirely closed
And you start, and you give grant to any birds to come in
You're going to have a problem
Same with anything, like if you, you know, like there is a beaver, beaver story about a mouse
That started taking up residence in this guy's bundle and he had a conflict
Like I'm not supposed to have a problem with the animals
Right
But here's this mouse dug into the side of my bundle
What do I do?
And he ultimately decided to let the mouse live there
And the mouse would go and raid other people's tobacco stores in the night and bring them back to his bundle
And so it turned out being a good thing. There's some songs associated with the mouse
But, you know, I myself experimented as a beaver man
Let mice come into my modern house
It's not a good idea
They might not bring you tobacco
No, and I think in the past letting birds into your teepee was not a good idea
You know?
Yeah
But other than that kind of a thing, that little space, that's a controlled space
Right
Yeah, other than that little space, we're not allowed to kill things other than for food
You know?
Yeah, or, you know, like there's plants that are used for different things and stuff, of course
But, you know, you have to have a good reason to be taking out some life, not just because you're afraid of it or just because it's an ice or whatever, you know?
Like what we do today
So I'm going to recap this and then we're going to start again
Okay
The rattlesnakes are a good example of the agreement because
They are an excellent example of the agreement because they have rattles
