Right, and so they could, if they don't have rattles, just simply wait till you get close enough to them
Maybe you don't notice them, maybe you're afraid of them, whatever, then just bite you
But because they have rattles, they alert you and they ask
They've got another step, like all of the venomous snakes, they're very first self-defense camouflage
Yes
So they will just sit very still and hope that you just pass by
Right
But if that doesn't work and you don't just pass by and you're going to injure them, threaten them
If you come, I mean, you have to come within four or five inches of a snake to get bit in reality
Yeah
So if you come that close to it, that means it's life is threatened
And it's going to bite you
Now rattlesnake has one more step in mitigating that conflict
That you don't find anywhere else
You find it in North America
Because I think this is the agreement in North America that we're not just going to kill each other for being there
Under that circumstance, the rattles can evolve
If you don't have that circumstance, then all it does is alert the human before it gets bit to the snake's presence and the human hates the snake and kills the snake
Yes
Alright, let me try to recap this one more time
So the rattlesnake is an example of the agreement
It gives you a chance to remember to respect the animal because it warns you, thoughtably warns you
In a way that everything recognizes this sound
Very distinctive sound
And so where that treaty has been well-kept, where that agreement has been kept, the rattlesnakes keep their rattles
In some places where that agreement is not kept by the humans, the rattlesnakes begin to lose their rattles
That's right
Now there's no more warning
And the first thing, camouflage, turns out to be very problematic for the human because the human will die
Yeah, the human can't see them
Blind, essentially
Yeah
Alright, hold that thought, one more session, I'll be back
Okay?
Yep, sounds good
