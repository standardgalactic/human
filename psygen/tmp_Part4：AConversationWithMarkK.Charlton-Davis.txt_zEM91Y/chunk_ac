They were barefoot.
They didn't even have bone arrows, so you would use clubs.
And when we would rock across, run across the flat lands where the rocks were, flat rocks,
like long big white flat rocks, run across those, their feet would click, click, click, click, click, click, click.
They were that tough.
Their feet would click like a horse.
You know.
Young kids too, like teenagers, you know.
Sure.
Yeah, they've grown up always in that way of life.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Well, this is a good place for us to pause.
Yeah.
We will continue again sometime soon.
Thank you for joining us.
There's more to the story, I promise you, and we'll get to it as soon as we can.
Thanks.
Bye-bye for now.
Bye-bye for now.
