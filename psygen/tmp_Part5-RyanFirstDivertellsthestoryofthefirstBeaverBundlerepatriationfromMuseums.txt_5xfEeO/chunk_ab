she didn't used to dealing with prairie Indians at all
you know
and uh Frank was Frank was putting like putting it on like he was like he was gonna like
I'm I'm I'm gonna take off with this fuck you see what see what we're gonna do call the cops
let's see what happens you know what kind of shit show this starts
all right yeah
so he threatened her and then he backed off you know played played with her a little bit and backed off
so we looked at the Caesar's pipe we looked at the headdress you know they got to they got to check
them out and everything and and then and then we went looking for the bag
we went down the down the storage area where the bag is supposed to be
and we were walking to where the bag was supposed to be we weren't in that
area yet
I mean we were we were in the basketry
stuff area where there's stuff like that but we weren't supposed to be in the stack where that was
but Carol heard something singing
and stopped and opened a drawer and pulled out the bag
yeah there it was with the number and everything
wow Carol Murray yeah
there were other there were other
corn husk bags in there it was like we it was like she just I don't know how she like she said she
heard singing but the museum didn't even think to checking that area with obviously there was
other corn husk bags there yeah right they're the category system right yeah it was it was a drawer
with a bunch of them and and she just kind of like went through them and there was the one with the
right number she pulled it out and it looked old as fuck like it should
yeah no rattles though what's that no seven rattles oh the rattles were already with the
bundle oh really wow we're just missing the bag oh yeah yeah yeah um so we we went back up
you know by that time the bundle was put together they just had to put the rattles in the bag
and then we sang it out of there and you know what song Alan chose to sing to lead it out of
there Carol Carol Carol carried the bundle
and she would soon become transferred a beaver bundle
and Alan was not transferred a beaver bundle yet but he was transferred that bundle
that was his first beaver bundle that I took out of harvard
he became milder for the beaver bundles later and
any bundles alive among people there was at that time yeah there was there was um
um there was two
um one of them owned by Adolf and Beverly Hungry Wolf
and another owned by Paul Rasker
um basically that you know like none that were really like inside the tribe
I mean Paul Paul you know Paul's like none of them were like oh like both of those bundles
were functional and everything but they were like once Alan got going that's when the beaver
bundle started back up you know um
and his teacher was Mike Swimsunder who was the same teacher for the other two for Adolf and Paul too
he was really the last beaver man you know the last survivor
um he had uh he grew up with it his parents had a beaver bundle and um
when his dad died he took his dad's role
and and uh taking care of it with his mom
and then when his mom died people stopped coming to the ceremony
and then when people stopped coming to the ceremony he took his bundle and brought it to the river and gave it back
gave it back to the water he thought it was done and that was like in 1960 something he did that
and then you know mid 1990s
um we're bringing beaver bundles back
sexy too
and uh yeah we we uh we brought that one back from Harvard um
and and that was transferred to Alan now uh the song there was song coming out of the museum
was the uh the snake man song when he cried anyway
really the victory song yeah
yeah yeah
oh my way
that was that was a song Alan saying bringing the beaver bundle out
and everybody climbed in that van and I was like shaking hands they were all nervous they were like
come on come on
I'm going out
like we just robbed the bank let's get out of here we got this bundle let's go
yeah
before they change their minds yeah exactly right yeah
but yeah we went out we went out to uh mash and tuck it
everybody enjoyed the casino had a good time brought it brought him back to Boston everybody got their playing back but Carol
and Tom had an extra day and Carol was the one actually bringing the beaver bundle back
had to go through Montana first
and um and so um uh yeah Carol um Carol and Tom spent an extra day with me I got
to tour them around Boston and stuff and show them my place and we had a good time I got to know
Carol really well she ended up becoming the female elder uh for the beaver bundle when I got transferred
so she taught Adrian uh
yeah and when did the bundle leave the museum uh that was May of 1996
I started negotiating I think
you know October of November the first of the previous year
so it wasn't it wasn't that long a thing to go through
but it was I was intense it was my whole life at that time
you know and once I and once I'd got got that bundle out of the museum
um the sense that I felt was that like
I've done something you know like okay if I if I if I fucking die it's okay
because I've done something yeah you know yeah
yeah
so that bundle went home Alan got transferred
and then a bottom month later Joyce Spoonhunter calls me
and says hey you know that group of elders that came up to Harvard to pick up that bundle
yeah so oh they're they're going on another tour
they're gonna be in Washington DC and then New York and then Chicago
um I can't go with them but somebody really needs to be there to document
the collections do you think you could do it
so yeah I used what was left of my GI bill
went on tour with the elders I went to meet them in Washington DC they had no idea I was coming
Joyce didn't tell them I showed up at the Smithsonian or no was it at the Smithsonian
no it was at the it was at the hotel that we were gonna stay at that night I think
but it was some it was a very regal hotel I don't know where we were staying but it was it was
good duds um and um I remember I remember seeing four or five of the elders sitting on a marble bench
in the in the four year
hold that thought yeah I'm sorry about this group
it's okay it's all right four elders sitting on the marble bench we'll be back
