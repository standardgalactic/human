in our minds um let's let's just put the pause button on destroying everything around us and
attacking everything that moves and calling it intelligence let's put the pause button on criticism
without intelligence that leads us back together let's put the pause on terror in our social media
and electronic media that doesn't draw us into intelligent um conversation and conversion
and wonder let's put the pause on uh really kind of insipid forms of culture that are incredibly
self-aggrandizing but they're just more fetishes and fashions for things we're not becoming together
let's put the pause on women as sexual objects let's put the pause on hatred because of how
we want to live my fingers need to be different if they were all the same or if I just had one
finger my hand would be useless in my body which is the actually the upper reflection of my hand
it's a similar structure would also be useless and I would be lousy as a teacher or a father or a man
or a lover or a creator or even a fisherman or a hunter or even a killer even a warrior a fighter
of just a an alcoholic I would even be a bad one so we can call each other to excellence
and that's the opportunity we have in every moment of communication and thought let's do
more of that let's do less of the other thing a little piece of the time I think it's something
we can agree to regardless of which book we believe in or don't it doesn't matter those questions
what matters is do we come together so that our diversity becomes power and lifts us all up
or do we just bounce off and attack each other and then the world so that we all go down in flames
you know it's okay to go down in flames if you're gonna rise up as a phoenix life itself is that
process yeah this is the very process we're talking about we're doing the other thing
we're just burning each other down out of hubris and confusion fear and terror and we're further
terrorizing and dividing each other that doesn't work let's take down the sharks starting now
I'm with you I'm on your side let's be on each other's sides within four each other
a lot of paradigms or sales people thank you please feel free to share this if you care too
bye bye for now
