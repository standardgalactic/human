Remember some of the things that I have discussed today,
particularly that your memory is not a recording,
and that the physical universe might be best understood
as the reflection of something transcendental that exists beyond time and space.
And yet, we can find the character of this transcendental world expressed and embodied
in the vast variety of life and the living relationships of living places and beings,
their activities and specializations, their forms, their eyes, their hearts, their feelings.
So, this is my reflection.
This is what I've been reflecting on this afternoon.
Together with you, I hope that you find it enlightening and provocative and inspiring.
