hello everybody thank you for joining me it's gonna be a bit of a mixed bag
tonight we're in the brought to experience the new moon that begins the
next moon cycle. I'm not sure precisely which moon it is but it might be so at
Tsukitsum and Blackfoot could be the moon where either the raptors owls
particularly begin mating or there's an extra season an extra moon if they
don't sometimes called the deceptive moon or frog moon and I've come to the
lake which I haven't visited in a while hoping to see whether or not the the
blue herons are whether the males are standing their nests which is something
they do prior to the mating time in order to assert their residency in one
of the nests in the social tree there is one primary social tree and there are
a couple of males sitting nests now what I'm really hoping to see isn't just the
males sitting the nests but also their dances which I've had the privilege of
seeing before and I practice some of those dances to try and understand them
viscerally there's a very large evening convocation of crows wild guess at the
flocks size here is 62 yeah it's close but right now the
the herons that are sitting nests which I can see perhaps two are not very active
they're just hanging out and it's a little chilly since there's no competition they're
not engaged in their display behavior at the moment so today's video or discussion will
be as I probably mentioned earlier bit of a grab bag not sure yet what I'm gonna
chase or talk about and I'll be visiting the the blue heron tree which appears to
have recently lost a couple of branches peculiarly unexpectedly a couple of high
branches have been lost they broke off of course we did have some intense wind and
storms here for a while not too long ago I doubt anyone could get up that tree but
the branches almost look like they've been cut off and it's interesting that next to
the social tree which is some sort of fir tree with many cones many many cones there's another
tree facing South ish it's to the right of the social tree which has many old nest is nests in
it but get reused each year yeah that tree is definitely lost a major branch off to its left
and I think there were some nests associated with that branch but the tree to the to the
right of it facing from from north of the tree facing south that tree usually has a
red tail hawk nest in it each season and so those two animals they raise their young side by side
in this possibly unusual situation here comes one of the guys who's another active observer of
animals and it's like there's a dead bird in the street hey man good to see you not sure what kind
of bird it was looked like maybe a robin so perhaps either matters have of residency have been
relatively settled already in the social tree and I missed the onset or it's so early that
there's no competition and we just have the really early the really the earliest
surters the audacious ones willing to wait and select their nests early and defend them in a
sense mostly with displays but occasionally there's some sky chasing stuff going on
and a few days ago I noticed the first yellow jacket and over the past couple nights I've heard
frogs I found a frog colony that apparently is quite large which I've I've passed where it is many
times but I never heard them until recently a few nights ago for the first time in a couple
times since and for the past couple days I've seen for the first time in memory
the peculiar insects I think sometimes referred to as field crickets or potato bugs these are
large wingless spiky-legged creatures that look incredibly fierce and might be able to get some
mandibles you know on you but are generally harmless they're just extremely fierce looking
and I've seen them out and about I saw one this afternoon and I saw one last night and frankly
I don't remember ever encountering them here in San Francisco now of course people with
backyards or who live near fields this kind of thing they're they're much better informed
about what lives here what can live here than I am because those little yards and such provide a
refuge for living creatures and plants and insects and amphibians and reptiles and birds and so on
but as I don't have a backyard associated with my flat I don't see much of that and I don't know
anyone with a backyard so these are some of my recent phenological noticings and concerns and as
I've explained in previous videos one way to think about phenology and there are many different
perspectives to approach it from is the transformations in relationships and behaviors
of plants animals insects and other fungi and microorganisms and so on over each moon cycle
each year in a specific place that one generally becomes intimate with and any place is sort of
my place but a couple of my places are in Golden Gate Park where there's a lot of life
but it's not as diverse as it might be partly because this rather than being a wild place is
kind of an invented place all of this used to be sand dunes and is now along maybe three and a half
miles from the ocean there's a swath of garden and trees and park but underneath the soil here is
sand because it used to be all sand dunes so if you lift up the loam to see what's living under
there what kind of detritivors you might find right insects that eat detritus or detritus
you'll see a few familiar creatures occasionally your wigs wood lice or pill bugs this are
sometimes called but mostly what you see are sand fleas by the thousands
it's a very interesting and peculiar ecology I remember when I first came here I thought well
this isn't this isn't a real wild place this is a place humans made but it's it's only partly true
there's an aspect of truth there and there's an aspect of confusion there because every place
there's life is a living place and so this is a living place and has the deep non-ordinary
spirit magic and nurturing medicine that living places are naturally effulgent with took me a
little while because my brain was too confused by ideas the other day on Facebook someone posted
something claiming that transcendental beings inhabit our subconscious and I thought that was
kind of interesting but I remember responding something like well I'm I think there's some
kind of non-ordinary beings that also inhabit our consciousness and the evidence of this is ideas
I guess originally when we were very small ideas must have been an astonishing experience
but as we grew up and became entlanguaged and culture aided and exposed to the layered
array of ways of structuring memory and imagination we became vulnerable to some of the the traps
and confusions associated with our seemingly peculiar capacity for formal representational
cognition and as I've mentioned previously other animals appear to have aspects of this capability
that it's not clear that they employ something similar to tokens right the way that we use words
and there's lots of interesting confusion orbiting these topics like the asteroid belt
in our solar system probably the remains of ancient planets maybe they smacked into each
other and broke up and yet remained somehow in relation even while shattered forming something
resembling a ring around the Sun primarily embodied between Mars and Jupiter
and it's interesting that we associate Mars whose moons are named
Phobos and Deimos I can't remember which one is which but I think the approximate translations of
those are something like terror and or fear and so what was the other one
can't recall at the moment
wood ducks that's not the translation there's a couple of them here
it might be like terror and catastrophe or something like this
and you know under the pressures of representational cognition
and it's relatively common for our coherent you know otherwise generally coherent
feelings of identity itself and safety predictability for these things to get all tangled up
or even shatter and in psychology we have the idea of
what we refer to as multiple personality disorder
yet it's always seemed to me well always might be the wrong word it's long seemed to me
that we all have different aspects of consciousness so that for example if I'm attending and concerned
about threats the character of my consciousness takes on a different persona in a way
and that persona is somewhat disembodied usually there are exceptions
an immediate threat such as a car bearing down on me that I hadn't seen before crossing the street
will produce a strong instantaneous visceral response that precedes any kind of thinking
but if I'm primarily thinking and of course there's different kinds of thinking and modes of thinking
we can talk about thinking for different reasons and that's why the word doesn't have
a single sense or even an explicit catalog of senses that we can depend on because we will always
mean something slightly unique and contexted when we use words but their definitions
are rarely contexted in the ways that we use them and this creates confusion because
we might think for example that a word or an idea concept is supposed to mean
a specific thing or should mean a specific thing
and when it seems to mean something else it may become concerned or upset
because now we can't tell well what is the meaning of the word
well there is no the meaning of the word
and the disembodied, decontexted definitions can't supply meaning
they only supply a glimpse into the structured records
of the protocols we use with language so rather than give meanings
and again what we mean by meaning can change in context and here I'm talking about
the senses of a word's definitions in a dictionary
these can be deceptive to the aspect of our awareness that wants a relatively complete
explicit grasp on meaning or identity or process transformation
and one of the most strange and fascinating words and concepts ideas that we have
that is constantly causing us trouble and there's a few
one of them is culpability whose fault is it something goes wrong whose fault is it
is it my fault is it someone else's fault should there be a court case
and of course from childhood we're scripted to first we may have a visceral or a fundamental sense
of something being good or not good someone being kind or unkind
an act that feels to us to be just in the sense of good and true and virtuous
or an act that feels unjust unjust wrongdoing harm
and this leads to really significant problems because in modern cultures
we're scripted to undergo uptake
of the origins
of what we refer to as our legal system
and this word is involved the the origins and roots of this word
are related to the idea of legitimacy and also of religion you can hear
these ledge sounds right leg literally oh there's a running rat
now you see i've just seen a rat
is that good is it bad is it legitimate was it a hallucination
am i supposed to see a rat or should i be not supposed to see a rat
okay there's certain little mindlets in the asteroid field of consciousness and of course
there are planets there too but where things are broken up can become very confusing
for us poor human beings mostly because the contexts in which we will encounter
ideas like courtrooms supposed to justice and injustice have largely been captured
by specific aspects of our capacity for representational cognition
primarily as they are instanced in collectives and if the collectives are mostly themselves
just representations then we end up doubling down on the origins of the problems that plague
our lives and minds
but i think it's a a terrible tragedy
that happens to us or really a series of tragedies
that happened to us in childhood as we're undergoing the processes of in language
hanging and culturation because we get imprinted with whatever the currently
popular or instanced versions
of mostly absurd
litiginous
thoughts concerns ideas processes institutions courtrooms lawyers prisons jails police
surveylers judges juries and in a way it's very difficult for most of us to resist
internalizing these things so somehow this is a really complex mess
because somehow
first
the nature of our collectivity our togetherness
is generally captured and counterfeited in a thousand different ways
primary ways having to do with money power social hierarchy ownership of property objects
ideas about rights and these kinds of things so firstly
there's a problem where the authenticity of our collectives
is lost
we're captured and then
represented to us in institutional and societal forms
and then as children we
take on the imprint of these forms
which are already like second or third or fifth or fiftieth order representations
and we internalize them creating a bizarre
sort of structured reflection
of how and why we've come into contact with these ideas and how
they've affected our our feelings our lives our relationships but particularly our interiority
our unminds relationship in a sense we could say with itself but it's not really relating
with itself it's relating with the representations
and so we end up forming little aspects of consciousness mindlets if you will
that specialize in navigating
the really bizarre terrain that results when something authentic is first represented culturally
then internalized and re-represented
in relations with our own being our own feelings our own consciousness
so that we can have the experience of being judged or surveilled
by beings that don't really exist and aren't judging or surveilling us
except essentially in our imagination
it doesn't mean no one's judging or surveilling us it just means that we're not really in relation
with those judges or possible surveyors we're in relation with the reflection the represented
reflection of our history and responses to such things
and our reactions and projections of such things
and for many of us this is a kind of torture especially when we're under stress or we're
injured or we're sick or we're isolated or we're very poor or we're homeless
or we're battered or we've been raped or abused or ignored or evicted
and so in these circumstances
these aspects of consciousness become very inflamed and they can become inflamed in all
kinds of different ways and the little mindlets can overcome with their intense scrutiny
a very specific concerns fears injustices they can overcome the coherence of our mind
and then our mind collapses into
a situation where the roots of our experience of being human
being a specific kind of human perhaps a specific gender of human
these experiences under what when dominated by for example a threat sentinel or judge
or something that's trying to determine whether something in is just or unjust virtuous or bad
these aspects of mind can overcome and dominate the roots of our being in consciousness
so that the mind now finds itself or we find ourselves in a war inside ourselves
and the soldiers of this war
the commanders and generals and soldiers and sergeants and so forth they so to speak
they are not concerned with preserving the coherence of our felt sense of being
