like our institutions in our society rather than being coming truly concerned with resolving
problems they become concerned with continuing to exist and to be the aspect of mind that gets
funding funding meaning attention energy awareness
in action
and in this situation our mind is prone to collapse into
a very narrow painful and constrictive behaviors and qualities and experiences
now
usually if we were going to evaluate such a state we would say oh this is a state of
grave disorientation and that's not unreasonable but that's not the only thing that's going on
actually what's happening often is a kind of injury
and there may also be
it may we may also be seeing symptoms of of historical injury reenacted
right because if I become extremely concerned about
some kind of wrongdoing I was involved in
it is as if I'm reliving that wrongdoing
I can remember events and situations where I made decisions or choices that I later deeply regretted
and when I call these to mind it's almost as if I'm re-experiencing them so in a way
or at least from one perspective
the little mindlets they are concerned with something not entirely dissimilar to ghosts
memories of beauty or joy or comfort
memories of adventure or heroism
but also memories of wrongdoing injustice, harm, pain, suffering, fear, confusion, helplessness,
injury, illness, these things
our minds can be analogized as vehicles and the concerns
that produce specialized elements such as the threat sentinel the opportunity sentinel
and these are just some words I made up to talk about this stuff
or the relational sentinel right the one who watches over relationships
the evaluative sentinel is it good is it bad do I want more of it less of it
do I not care there are all these little sort of mindlets processes
that over time acquire their own history of origin and action success and failure
but among these one of the strangest ideas of all and it's it's not strange in that we can't
understand how it comes to be or why we might refer to it but it's the idea of supposed to
this is not supposed to be like this or this is supposed to be some way that it's not being
and this becomes very confusing and troubling for many of us
it would be nice if we had better language around all of these things particularly the
idea that we form little sub minds
so we just had some incoming an incoming
Canadian goose couple
and
taking off and landing but also flying can be a very vocal
behavior for these beautiful creatures
ancient and noble
I don't think they make sophisticated song because they're supposed to
now in a way you can see if you look throughout history
very complex relationship with the idea of supposed to
apparently humans were so confused at some point about supposed to
but either something
very powerful and surprising
carved a bunch of supposed to use into some stones and gave them to a guy with a halo
so to deliver to the people that were his people
and all throughout our religious books and our philosophical ideas there's a background
and we really need a better better language for
a background of supposed to use and not supposed to use
and one of the problems with that is that actual experience differs from rule-based protocols
rules based protocols are abstract and many of them are presumed to
it is it is presumed rather that it is proper to attend the abstract protocols
rather than having the contextual sensitivity
to be selective about which of them might get enacted or questioned or resolved
this is very confusing and very painful for nearly everyone but there are some people
who are absolutely tortured by it because for them
the abstractness can come to represent in interiorly absolute authority
and an absolute rule that is to dominate every possible context and situation
and this is why
our religions are so problematical because in many of them it's not clear whether
they started out this way but over time they became weaponized
and the evidence of weaponization is the promise either of eternal bliss or eternal torture
these promises are taken as absolute the protocols are taken as absolute
they pervade over all possible things and that collapses into an abstract rule-based system
that no living being can reasonably contend with in fact that kind of weaponization
produces various kinds of what we would refer to as madness
and sometimes the madness is angry but sometimes it's just wildly incoherent within itself
to such a degree that those suffering from it
cannot compose anything resembling coherent human mindful experience
and it's a terrifying tragedy and one we are all you know not out of reach of most of us because
when we're placed under enough stress or isolation and so on
most of us are inclined to overfund an aspect of awareness that's attacking the basis of our minds
though we cannot detect that with the minds less compromised
or we may we may have an intuition that something's wrong in our mind
but because the dominant processes are so expensive and
um
ravenous endlessly hungry for any kind of fuel or power
they can sequester capture from consciousness and awareness we can fall into all kinds of traps
where
an aspect of awareness that might otherwise if not super inflated be at least modestly useful
in coping
with trouble or loss threat or pain
um
inverts and effectively becomes the source of trouble or loss or pain or confusion
and I suspect this is familiar to most of my listeners because all of us have experienced
something like this
particularly if we are faced with a problem
something painful
for a long period of time and particularly if that problem has old old roots
in our developmental uh what we might call psychology with the development of our minds
and again I just want to mention that it's not like we have one mind although
you know depending on how we frame it and why we're looking what our purposes are what we're
curious about we'll come up with different models of mind and mindedness
usually there is a kind of relatively coherent uh should I call this
this
a root aspect of my being and identity that I think of as me right
and it it supersedes all sub functions
yet it can collapse into or toward a given sub function so that now my experience of me
rather than being broad and diverse and alive and sensitive and creative and reverent and playful
becomes courtroom like
and so in these cases I've I've collapsed into a mindlet a sub process probably one I inherited
from culture um and language but also one that whether or not it's mostly artificial
is the remains of something important
something primordial
something that was visceral before it was conceptual or represented
and this is part of how the gambit works
in our interiority
something deeply true and primordial
is first buffered so that it becomes difficult to access
and then we're presented in culture society language ideas
with something that resembles it but is a counterfeit
and this is the root is one way to understand the roots of our vulnerability to these issues
and this happens all day every day in cultures of commodity and commerce
they're hyper representational they're actually chasing dissociation disembodiment
um the replacement of a meaningful human interiority
with arrays of ever more structured technological and confusing fictions
and one would imagine that it would be brilliant if in childhood we could be educated about these things
so that we would have the opportunity
to become curious enough about them that we might overcome
many of the traps and take advantage of the peculiar opportunities
that honestly are mostly missing from our common experience as adults
but rather than that kind of education we get the other kind that reinforces the representation problem
loss figuration of the lost thing counterfitting of the lost interior asset feelings
experiences of meaningful relation and identity
authenticity
we just get paved over the same way our living places do so that cars can drive on them and
most of those cars have nothing to do with well let's just say they're extremely expensive
to continue supporting
so many of us will arrive at early adulthood or late adulthood
largely deprived of the assets we've brought to our human incarnation
and trapped in a kind of hall of mirrors of representations
and commodities that mimic what was lost or buried or paved over
and some of us will become very concerned about these matters and may become
philosophers or linguists or monastics because we will want to see through the veils
the layers and layers of confusion
that simply being an enlanguaged human being
nearly demands
and we'll be very lucky if we can find anyone at all who understands these matters
in any way that's useful or medicinal medicinal enough to be much help now
not all of us are meant for these paths right these sometimes very academic
or very demanding paths the path of monastic life is extremely demanding
in a sense
and most of us who will enter such paths will begin in a relatively confused state
and so we may pursue paths in life or our development that actually contribute to the problem
at least in the beginning
but it is possible for us to learn and to discover the histories and origins and
natures of these problems and to become gently aware of them right hopefully not obsessively
aware in a way that guides us toward liberation from them
and we have traditions in various cultures surrounding this some of them are religious
some are monastic some philosophical some creative
in many ways i trust the creative ones a bit more because in any
process where there's playful exploration motivated by authentic human concern
there are paths out of the trap that natural the traps that naturally arise there
so
and i might look at all of this trouble that i've been wandering around
and think to myself something like it's not supposed to be this way
and while that might not be entirely untrue it's still quite confused
because it's not entirely clear what way it is or even what it is
or what trustworthy authority we might turn to to understand how it is supposed to be
now the word itself gives us a clue because normal it's a normative word right things
are supposed to be some way or not supposed to be someone when you actually look at the word
it involves a supposition for something to supposed to be some way someone has to
make the supposition themselves that this is the appropriate way for things and beings to be
and who makes the suppositions
who does the supposing what aspects of our mind awareness history habits
become involved when we become very concerned with what things are supposed to be or do
and again there's a normative a normalizing inclination there and i find it quite suspicious
not i wouldn't throw it away entirely i'd just be very cautious about how and where
it rises to authoritative dominance and consciousness and then begins making declarations
assertions
and the idea of supposed to rarely arises unless there's some troubling deviation from our
expectations and normative thought imposes a lot of expectations
unfortunately
i'm going to pause for a moment
and i hope to return to this discussion in just a few minutes
so obviously i have my own purposes and concerns around these matters
and some of them are very local to my own life and mind and others are concerns i have about
other living beings other human beings our societies our cultures our children
our relationships with each other with the strange institutions
that are largely estranged from our nature as human beings and as animals
with the future of the world
but i don't expect to swallow the moon or eat the ocean
i've come to understand what i've been able to learn about these things
because i am deeply concerned
and i'm not merely concerned with injustice
i'm also in love with virtue
not because i'm afraid of punishment but because it feels beautiful to be human
when i'm able to embody and enact virtuous relationships now of course this is already
a problem because if we presume the dichotomy of injustice and virtue now we're stuck
right i can't be virtuous all the time some of my behavior is unjust
and one of the ways this gets embodied in our culture is that the injustices get hidden in the
poor and the environment and children and elderly and sick people and poor people and so on
so
it's going to be really difficult for me if i start out with the polarity
right this is good this is bad this is what i want this is what i don't want and so on
these will produce expectation protocols judgment protocols evaluation protocols
