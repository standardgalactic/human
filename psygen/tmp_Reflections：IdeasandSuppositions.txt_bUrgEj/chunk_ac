and once those become familiar to me from my habit
they will be largely become invisible
right we have the capacity to learn things
that disappear from our volition as they become embodied
and many of our habits of thought and consideration evaluation concern
particularly about good and bad just and unjust normal and abnormal
these are inclined to be internalized
and that's not meaning it's not to say that it then becomes hopeless it just certainly becomes
more difficult because we will tend to see and feel our way through situations with what is
habitually familiar it has a kind of gravity that draws us back again and again to reenacting
patterns and behaviors that we may actually in our core you know in our essence
in our nature as human beings we may find these miserable and not like them at all
yet we will enact them over and over again once they become familiar
and that traps hard to escape from particularly by oneself
but if we can learn a little bit you know at a time if we can set off on the path of understanding
and open our awareness to these peculiarities of our modern humanity
and if we become curious and if we are passionate and playful
we will discover something very surprising
I might say the prisons I've described are made of doors but these doors are largely
invisible to our familiar approaches our familiar perspectives or angles of concern and interest
yet all throughout our lives
it remains possible for us to begin to set aside familiar habits that lead to traps
and wonder about the nature of all of these things and their historical origins their
cultural origins their non-ordinary origins
the other night I was talking with my son
about similar concerns and he asked a very peculiar question I'm not sure if it's his
question or another's I'm not even sure that it matters much
his question was
in our consciousness why would we place our trust in something so fundamentally insecure
as the mind-like processes familiar to our daily lives
it's a brilliant question it's the kind of question
that could reveal many doors if we take it partly playfully and partly seriously
and rather than answering the question I want to leave it open so that we can pursue it together
in our imagination which is where this is the word we have for
an aspect of our interiority that is both vulnerable to
and capable of liberating itself from
the peculiar predicaments of our minds and intelligences and hearts
with which we try to navigate our thoughts and feelings experiences relationships
and also their absences and also their mimic the mimicry the counterfeits of them
and perhaps by being able to talk about these things together we can begin
we can embark on a path that leads to freedom
for if we are not free in our own minds and interiority the physical freedoms of our daily
lives quickly pale and can even become meaningless patterns of repetitive behavior
in which although our bodies are surviving and we may be being fed and sheltered and we may even
be lucky enough to have relationships they will collapse slowly for some quickly for others
into shell-like constructs that are uninhabitable because their dimensionality
is so impoverished that there's no air there's no oxygen for our hearts there's no oxygen for
our intelligences and the aspects that we might associate with our souls
I'm not sure that liberation is an achievement
many traditions clearly declare that there is nothing to achieve
and that the real trap is
believing in a distinct continuous self and there's some useful perhaps even virtuous
potential there
but even those of us who don't seek will not in this lifetime seek ultimate what we presume
to be ultimate liberation and there is no end of such a path it's an infinite path
even for those of us who are not inclined to pursuits in that direction
we can learn and discover and grow and come to understand the peculiar traps and predicaments
that we often may find ourselves twisted up in
in such a way that we can release our grip
and no longer be compelled to the kinds of intrinsically conflicted ideas and assertions
logics laws rules protocols
that we picked up
as our minds developed in cultures that were mostly opposed to their liberation
and somehow intent upon their capture
and to whatever degree we may make progress together in this matter authentic trustworthy progress
we will be healed we will be nourished and we will discover astonishing depths
to our minds and our humanity and our animal nature our organismal nature our essential
nature our essential nature but are freely available when we are not otherwise
concerned
this is my hope this is my dream this is my prayer today
thank you for joining me I look forward to learning together again
very soon
bye bye for now
