Hello everybody. Welcome. As usual, I am walking in the gardens and there is a truly
astonishing diversity of living beings here, including this incredible gigantic sequoia
sequoia dendron gigantium sierra redwood but this one looks more like an upside down octopus
than a straight up and down redwood like we're used to seeing. It's an incredible organism.
Really beautiful.
It can be difficult here because
humans do things that don't make sense at all all the time. Right now they're chopping down
old trees many very old trees
to make room for what they're calling a greenhouse but they already had a greenhouse
and really they should not be stealing land in the gardens for this project
and there's not much I can do about it. The humans often do very ridiculous things here in the garden.
Of course we live in a city and so the imperatives of the city and of money
have precedence over the importance of the living beings and relationships in the gardens
and this is a similar problem that we have in our own lives.
The structured nonsense going on under the guise of civilization
intrudes and invades upon and torments
many aspects of our interiority and our humanity and our nature as organisms and beings
and it's tragic and it's heartbreaking.
Many of my closest friends struggle with terrible burdens
that have nothing to do with who they are or are not
but rather are the results of whether or not they fit into the bizarre artificial jigsaw
of modern culture and society and the imperatives that underlie it
and the vast majority of those imperatives are fundamentally toxic.
Of course we can learn how this all came to be and we can learn together
how to form minds and lives that establish a new in our time a new way of being human
and intelligent creative playful and loving together
and that's part of my my hope and my dream.
I was thinking I'm often thinking it's a problem for me I was thinking last night
about the video I made previously in which I spoke of the hall of four of a people
who are a people and in our own lives the question is important in various ways one
of them being who are my people who are those people who I feel
at home with recognized by seen by valued by loved by respected by
and in general everyone all the living beings are my people
but more specifically I am most at home with creative people artists writers
some intellectuals though though less than the others a little bit because
the intellectuals can be rather severe and confused when they uh
when they
depart from relation into language and concept
but I'm at home with intellectuals too a little less so the cultural creatives
the people who are deeply authentically creative these people we we tend to immediately recognize
each other and of course these are just words and categories actual situations
you know are much more diverse and rich
but yes writers and artists actors comedians dancers painters
musicians these are the people who I usually feel most at home with
and of course there are people who don't belong to any class who I also feel an immediate kinship
with right not because they have some specific quality or behavior but just because there's
an affinity there that is felt I feel it you know I was just talking with one of the
there's a few old scions of our neighborhood
one of whom is named Fred he's 90 but he's a very young 90
and he's you know a troublesome and brilliant man
and there's another man in my neighborhood both of these are older gay men
which is you know pretty common in my neighborhood where I live
since San Francisco is one of the
how to put this one of the um
historical origins of freedom
for people who are gay or differently oriented uniquely oriented of course they would say
I'm differently oriented what is difference and when do we when do we insert that idea
right different different from what but um San Francisco is one of the birthplaces of gay culture
and so we have a few
beautiful old people yeah and I was just speaking with uh with Richard
and his parrot Sherman who's a very gentle animal I got to have him on my arm for a bit
we were in a cafe together and I'd spoken with him a few times before
he's a heartfelt and intelligent man
he's got to be probably closing in on 80
there may be some wind noise for a bit I apologize it's not much I can do about it
in any case I was thinking last night about my previous video
and some things that I could add to it um
in that video I spoke about the holofore of what are a people
and how in my own life
I came to understand
that the organisms all of the organisms of earth are peoples
and once I understood this a lot of things changed for me in how I
saw and related with the living world because with peoples
you know uh in how we relate with them
over time and in unique situations we can acquire a relationship excuse me what I meant was
obviously we embody a relationship but we can acquire a reputation
and so if I am kind and gentle with the bees and if I occasionally help one of them or rescue one
word word gets out
so that all the bees that I encounter relate with me in a sense according to my reputation
but also not just that according to how I am treating them in the moment there is both right
there's both who is this person with me right now who are they being right now
and we have the same thing in in our human world
who are they being right now and who do I know them as you know how are they known
what are they known for and what are they known for this is the idea of reputation
I'd like to know more about the etymological origins of that word repute
and clearly there's a there's a phoneme there from other words like
represent repudiate
reprehensible most of these are are words with rather grim associations or connotations
but yes once once I realized that the living beings were peoples
then I began to learn that we acquire a reputation that spreads
beyond a given encounter with some plant or animal or living place or group of beings
and there are a number of specific beings I have close relations with
the bees ants and wasps the whales dolphins squids and octopuses
the spiders and praying mantises especially the jumping spiders
the corvids the crows ravens magpies blue jays hawks
the canadian geese the white cheeks ops beanie in blackfoot
sage plant rosemary plant the lavender plant
the sour grass
clover flowers
all of these beings the sparrows
the blackbirds hummingbirds bumblebees jasmine
honeysuckle salveas cactuses lizards and snakes of diverse kinds
the bats
and there are many more I mean all of the beings are my friends
I don't know all their names I don't know all their names
and I don't much like the English names
English names are leaving something out that's very important
which is what is the nature of our relationship over time the humans and these beings
many older languages contain in the names
hints about the relationships and also there are old stories about when animals or plants
helped our people in times of crisis or fear or need and also when we helped them
so what I was thinking last night as I was reflecting briefly on the video that I'd made
the recording anyway
was something having to do with an aspect of cognitive activism
that probably wasn't initially introduced by Alfred Korzybski but was uniquely
elaborated by him and it's an idea called non-allness
right and in our cognition in our habits with language and concepts
we have a lazy weakness of vulnerability that's often captured by
agents or
associations corporations governments and so on
the media and the weakness is to think of all instances of a class in one way
and to suppose that that way completely captures what's important about them
right so if we think about trees for example all trees are trees seems very straightforward
completely untrue vastly untrue true in language and concept not true in relation
the tree under which I sheltered in the rain
for a time while the rain passed I'm looking at this tree right now with love protected me
it's not the same as all other trees and the trees who I adore and have deep relations with
I can think of a few of them now not the same right they're not they're not regular instances
of the class a tree who speaks in your mind suddenly unexpectedly
will transform everything you ever thought about anything and trust me this happens
trees can speak but not in language they speak in emotion they speak in
in interiority the flows the ebbs the floods the waters of our interiority
and so all trees are trees only in language but they are beings in my heart
and if they are beings then you can see the dimensionality of the relational possibilities
explodes infinitely into infinity there is no limit
so non-allness is a really important principle to understand and keep
close to our awareness when we are thinking in terms of categories or when we are reading language
or when people are making declarations or assertions or arguments
non-allness simply points at the necessary and significant incompleteness of language
and the reason I bring this up is that when I think of identity most most people many people
are trained to think of identity as point like right it's one thing it's a tree
but the trees like like ourselves we are all beings instanced in a unique form we are the
universe instanced in a unique local embodied form and so the idea of a tree is insufficient to
capture the identity and nature of what this word points at
so we're trained to think in point like ways we'll think oh this kind of person is a bad person
this other kind of person is a good person this other kind of person is someone I can ignore
but kinds of people are transient
the classes do not capture what they point at and in fact they evict most of it
and so what I was thinking just to return for a moment the opposite of one of the opposites
of a point that's more useful is its apology right if you if you're driving somewhere a flat
road map will help you right it will show you routes but if you are hiking somewhere what
you need is a topological map because you need to know elevations you need to know the differences
in the terrain right for the sake of the car the flat map is sufficient for the sake of someone on
foot the flat map is insufficient and in relationships it's much more like being on foot
we have to see the peaks and valleys
and our language captures this almost not at all very poorly in general unless we're careful
in which case it's a little better
so what I was thinking last night was
you know it's true that the animals know and the insects know and perhaps the plants know
and that the humans are very dangerous
often confused sometimes cruel and part of why they are dangerous and cruel and confused
is because their ideas about living beings are mostly broken
over time they've suffered terrible amputations of relational dimensionality opportunity co-being
and this is the process that I refer to as the flattening of our our concepts into tokens
and tokenization and this is natural for a species that lives in its head
is oriented toward turning relationships into commodities and transactions
and has lost the lion's share of their interiority to these processes over time
but the animals and insects don't only see us by class
and we are often inclined to see them by class
this rosemary plant that I adore old rosemary plant
and the little spiders running on the ground next to it
they are my own heart they are my own body they are my friends they are my family
the many people this would sound bizarre to the plants don't talk they don't give you things
they don't you know it's not if this is true the plants do speak in fact their very forms are
exquisitely beautiful I'm tasting the sweetness of the nectar in the salvia flower right now
and in so doing I join with this plant with gratitude and reverence with love
so the animals and the living beings in the living places they're aware
of the generality of humans humans are dangerous often confused
and they can be cruel and again the reason is that they're
they're sort of sleepwalking in the world most of us be myself included
many of the things I can speak about I can only partially embody even though I can see them
and my capacity to embody them depends on many things that
they don't entirely lie beyond my control but I too am influenced by context and habit and
and like all beings I hitchhike on the momentums that have precedence around me
but the the living beings are also aware of non-allness in the sense that
although they they may have some kind of implicit instinctual concern about humans
probably due to thousands of years of evolutionary experience with our life form
they're also aware under some circumstances
that not all humans are that way all the time
and this is an example of non-allness
animals who have a history of long relation with our species
bees are an animal like this
but so too are all of the synanthropes
corvids skunks possums raccoon squirrels mice rats
cats and dogs cats and dogs are not you know they've been
we use the word domesticated it's kind of a strange word but they've become our preferred symbionts
and cats and dogs may be terrified of humans if they've had bad experiences
but they may also be playfully fascinated and interested in relating with us
and loving they can directly demonstrate what is obviously love
it's not a question they're not simulating love they love they're being love
