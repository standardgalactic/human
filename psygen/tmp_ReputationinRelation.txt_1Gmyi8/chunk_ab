and so the animals and the plants and the living places reserve whatever way they may be concerned
about our kind of animal in the world they reserve a place within that concern
for the exceptions right the humans who care and to our gentle who love
who have reverence and respect for other living beings
and some humans have to learn this I guess though this was not so much the case with me
I was pretty much born this way
but I even in my loving early years right even as a child when I was small
my human ideas could overwhelm my intelligence and I would expect for example that
I could take the fish with me and it would be my friend if I put it in my pocket
which led to tragedy from the fish for sure and my heart because I was crushed to discover
I had harmed or killed the being that I loved by wanting to take it with me and have it with
me all the time and I thought they can be my pets I was confused in that in this way between the
inward and the outward right it's safe to take them with me in my heart it's not safe to take
them with me in my pocket and I honor with reverence the memory of those little fishes
that I once put in my pocket thinking I want them with me always
for I learned a difficult lesson with them and other other beings
I had to make terrible mistakes in my life
to understand the difference between how the humans are trained to think
and act and what's actually possible and true and going on
some of those lessons still sting and even though I'm older now and have some experience
that's broad and rich I still make mistakes I can still be frightened or confused
and some of those mistakes are very painful for me
when my confusion causes the death or suffering of other beings
still happens but my point was ha that's funny actually my topology was
that in relating with living beings as instances of a people right this tree here is not just an
instance of the tree people it's an instance of all beings it's an instance of vegetal beings
it's an instance of tree beings it's an interest it's excuse me an instance of its phenotype
right the kind of tree that it is and many other things that we don't even have language for
so no concept can capture it or or convey it
but if we're going to choose one it's better to choose one with more dimensionality than with
less because as we exclude the dimensionalities of being we exclude the possibilities of our own
minds and our own relational roles and capacities
so I was thinking last night that although the animals and living places in plants recognize
humans as a as a serious threat a very dangerous animal I mean nothing's really as dangerous as
a human except maybe lightning or volcanoes or something bombs I don't know asteroids
but although they although they see us and recognize us as a threat they are also aware that
they have to pay attention to the uniqueness of the human in front of them
in the moment in situation in which they are together
and thus you will often see you know which apparently humans find this very surprising
I find it beautiful but not surprising you'll see animals helping one another that would ordinarily
not they would ordinarily ignore each other or perhaps be aggressive toward each other
or you will see animals helping humans or you will see humans helping animals
and this is you know it's beautiful it's natural because all beings are beings
so even though the humans are understood to be dangerous in general as a class
right the living places and beings pay attention to the unique situation at hand with this human
or these humans right here right now and this is why you see things like the grizzly man
right the guy who hung out with the grizzly bears though he made I think a serious mistake
that may have led to his death and it's an interesting mistake and I can't be sure what
happened with him I don't know for certain but as was unlike his previous habit he brought
a female companion with him to an island where he knew there were specific bears
that were quite aggressive and in thinking about this I just remember one day my girlfriend and I
we walked into a donut store and there was a young woman with a pretty large fierce looking pit bull
and as we walked in the pit bull became very disturbed and
somewhat aggressive and its and its owner said oh wow that's so strange he never does this
he's never liked this and I took that seriously so I thought about it for a moment
and when we walked outside I asked my girlfriend Coco a brilliant soul she was
I said to her are you on your period and she said yes I started a couple days ago
and that made me think ah you know these predators the dogs and the bears they sense blood
they can smell blood from a long way away and I don't know that that's the explanation of the
dogs discomfort and nor do I know that that was the problem that got the grizzly man killed
can't recall his name but he should have thought twice about bringing his female companion to a
place where there are grizzly bears because it's not the same he doesn't bleed and she does
and again I don't know you know if this was the actual problem it could have been something else
and you can see how once like once one has an idea
of an explanation for something there's a propensity to just see that way and think oh yes
this is the answer but we have to have non-allness there too we have to realize
that's an interesting idea reasonable possible might not be the problem though
but I wonder about what happened with him the grizzly man and his female companion
I wonder if she had her period and it aggravated or you know woke up something in the bears
that might not have otherwise occurred
and again this is the thing of paying attention to specifics
right the fact that the bears are fine with him and won't hurt him usually
is not true when the equation so to speak changes we have to pay attention to the
unique particulars I wonder if he thought you know he must have known that the grizzlies are very
sensitive to blood and as predators hello they uh
they have a an affinity
they will seek out animals that are bleeding because those animals are often injured
and are not just easier to kill sometimes this may sound strange and it's a weird way of putting it
sometimes the injured animals need help dying
right and the bear can kill them very quickly
and it's just important to be aware that
animals like sharks bears dogs some cats
they will their personality will transform dramatically
if blood is in the water if the scent of blood is in the air
and I'm pretty sure grizzlies can detect that sense at incredible distances
and you know they're what we usually refer to as apex predators
they're at the top of the food chain nothing hunts grizzly bears except humans
nothing much hunts sharks the occasional orca might get involved with that
other sharks might get involved but only humans pretty much hunt sharks
so
so I was thinking last night about all non-allness and about how
when we relate with the living peoples we acquire a reputation that spreads far and wide
I don't know the explicit extent of its spread
but it would not surprise me to find that it was kind of universal that it it might even be
so universal as to escape temporal locality
and follow us through many lives presuming that something like reincarnation
is going on and I think there is something that resembles it going on but it's probably much
more complex than the way we think about it because I don't I'm not a fan of the I point
like idea of a soul I'm a fan of the topology idea of a soul where there are sort of a soul
is a constellation of relationships outside of time instanced locally in a given being
and all of these things fit together and sort of support each other in my mind in my thoughts
all of the living beings have what I would call non-ordinary senses of course they're
entirely ordinary the only place they're not ordinary is in our ways of thinking that exclude
them and many people will say well these are spiritual things okay I'm not terribly opposed
to the idea but they're fundamentally relational things
they don't require fancy metaphysics and we don't have to explain them and many of them
are probably inexplicable in the models and language and conceptual milieu
that we're accustomed to as formal representational cognitives in the modern age
it's clear to me when I relate with bees physically with my hands
that they are aware of my reputation and they're also aware of the character of my interiority
in fact if humans wanted to understand whether minds can touch each other or not
a really amazing potential here has been overlooked which is that in terms of cell mass
we are enormous of course whales are much bigger than us and there are other animals
that are larger in living places are enormous compared to us but
in terms of cell mass
a human has probably I don't know 50 trillion cells maybe 25 trillion of which are bacterial
come from the world 25 trillion of which approximately are eukaryotes come from our
gene line and our mitochondrial line so
if size matters in this way and I suggest that it does and we wanted to find out whether we
could touch other minds all right the first place to look or a really good place to look
would be how are very tiny creatures affected by our local presence
can we touch the minds of insects I would start there of course if we really wanted to take it
to its nth degree we could you know use microscopes and determine if we can touch
the being the essential being of microorganisms which I strongly suspect we can I have good
reasons to suspect that from experiment but with insects a class that of organisms that humans
usually ignore think of as trivial which is ironic since their biomass vastly exceeds our own
on the planet which also means their sensing mass vastly vastly exceeds ours
the insect populations are aware of subtleties in the character of environments in the sun the moon
the weather the chemical makeup of atmospheres that humans will never approach
no matter what instruments we build
and so that great sensitivity provides an opportunity
and I've witnessed things that seem to me miraculous
uh-huh there's Zephardos chasing his his enemy
yeah
chasing him off
defending his territory
he shows his force his power by
by pecking the branches on the tree that his enemy has settled in well it's not exactly his
enemy it's too simple a language but the one who is intruding the stellar is Jay
you see he's using distributed communication he could yell at his enemy
or his the interloper but instead he taps a branch on a tree and if you
if you've not had this experience it's really quite profound because
sometimes the jays when I first arrive in a place where they know me and I place my palm
against a tree because I'm connecting with the tree the jays will land on the tree and
tap tap tap tap tap tap and I'll feel the pulse of that tapping in the wood and it's a visceral
very powerful feeling you can feel the physical power of the animal
and it seems to me the males are more um oriented toward this behavior but
both both of them the male and the female both employ it and it's not just to drive off enemies
it's also a way of communicating right because the the stellar's jays in this case
are not trying to drive me off they're trying to welcome me they're saying hello
but yes if we wanted to understand something about
do mines touch one of the places we might start is with very small creatures
and seeing if our minds can influence the very small creatures if they can sense us
if they can sense our intention or if we can communicate with them with our minds
and I've experienced astonishing things in this regard I remember um one year
a female a queen paper wasp awoke too early it was too cold and I could tell she was struggling
it would not survive I felt so I brought her in my home and I had a cage I could put her in
for a while and I fed her um mostly I made sure she had water and sugar water she probably needed
other things but then one day it became very clear that it was time to let her go right it was warm
enough now she would survive and I had to negotiate getting her out of the cage and into the sunlight
she needed the sunlight to warm her body so that she could fly
and um Coco was with me on this day and we opened the cage and I I spoke to her in language but
I was using my imagination I pictured what I was saying and I gave her a series of directions you
know walk over to this edge of the cage climb up on this stick and I will take you into the sun
and don't fly off with the stick because I need to get you into the sun and
she followed each of my directions explicitly and Coco was shocked even though you know she's a
she was an unusually minded beautiful human being and I myself was surprised because
the insect followed essentially five consecutive directives
instantaneously and without deviation
how did she know
but I have lots of relationships with insects where this kind of thing happens all the time
though usually not so explicitly there are many small insects who are my friends
who I form relationships with I remember when I was a young child
maybe seven or eight in our backyard in Stockton which had been made out of farmland
what had been farmland for many years so when we first got there there were many spiders and
praying mantises and insects though DDT was going to change that right quick in any case
there was a huge orb weaver I mean honestly with her leg spread she was probably almost as big as
my face her abdomen was probably three quarters the size of an egg she was huge she could eat small
birds I never saw her do that she lived in our backyard for a while and although this is a little
I feel a little bit sad for the moths now but I used to catch these grass moths in my hands and I
would hold them up to her web and she would climb down on my hand and very gently very gingerly take
them off and bite it and carry it back into her web and wrap it up and eat it and she came to know me
this way and I came to know her and my parents were quite nervous but I wasn't concerned because I knew
she was my friend and I had not dissimilar relationships with black widow spiders when I
was a child spider that everyone thinks of as deadly I used to have a a false bunk so that
there was more room in my in my bedroom and my father built for me so my bed was up near the
ceiling and in one year black widow which I was you know obviously I was friendly with these
spiders in general and this is the thing about having a reputation right among a people living
people um one year a black widow made its nest right above where I slept in the corner of the
ceiling and my parents were extremely upset about this like ah that's not we're not letting that
happen you're going to take that out and I said don't you dare touch that spider
of course she and I you know she was my companion she was my friend every night I would look up and
see her and I wasn't afraid and she knew I respected her and there was no problem there
but eventually she made an egg case and that that was a problem I don't recall how we solved it
I like to think we solved it in a beautiful way but it seems unlikely that we could have
I don't think we killed the egg case I probably put it in a jar and let them hatch and let them go but
we couldn't have hundreds of baby black widows right where my bed is because they're gonna
they're gonna you know they're well they'll distribute themselves
but yes I've had many adventures with small creatures and if we wanted to understand whether
our minds or our souls or something within us can directly touch the being of other of other
