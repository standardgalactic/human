creatures which I am absolutely certain that it does and it can but if we wanted to experiment
there's ifaros making his greeting display he zooms by my face
one moment
if we wanted to understand this then we could experiment with very small creatures because
the consciousness mass of our cell mass is like a galaxy I don't know how many cells
comprise an ant or a bee or a wasp or a spider
but it's probably something like one ten millionth or one trillionth of the cell mass of our bodies
and so we must appear to them relationally is like a galaxy compared to I don't know a star
and so if we want to understand whether we can directly communicate with other beings
the very small beings are a good place to start
but yes the humans represent a danger but not only a danger also an opportunity
for communion reunion co-being friendship companionship and we have to be sensitive
you know as I was not as a child right to the differences
in our way of being in the world as compared with an ant or a bee or a spider or a wasp or a bird
or a mouse or a tree or a living place
and we have to be careful of taking them into our world
because our world is not friendly to children and hearts and spirits living beings
our world tends to make of them commodities representations
you go to the toy store and you'll see we don't just represent the animals as toys
we represent the humans as toys too
all of the beings
we represent them
so our world is dangerous for them I can't put the fish in my pocket and take them with me
hmm
and when we treat the other beings with kindness and reverence and respect
adoration
word gets around
in the living library of beings on earth
we come to be known
you know we have the capacity to come to be known
as a good companion a good friend
and
as someone beloved
you know I I talk with the bees
in my heart and my imagination and sometimes with my words
and they return the favor but not in ordinary language
while we're awake the structure of our minds
is not conducive
generally
to exploring the living library the cognizium of the beings on earth
which the human cognizium is a sub array of
so over time you know we acquire a reputation
and for some of us that's no reputation
we're just like any other human most of the time
but when we engage heartfully and attentively
with wonder and mutual concern reverence respect
then we come to be recognized
by all the living beings in the living places
everyone knows that an encounter with a bear
or another apex predator wolf pack
it's a danger it's dangerous we could get hurt we could be killed these are predators
but that's only provisionally true
in the right state of mind those beings become extensions of our own bodies and hearts
and will not harm us
because they will recognize in us
communion
the possibility of friendship companionship
ifaros
he's paying very close attention to something
he is aware of something i cannot see but by attending him my mind changes
though i do not yet see what is concerning him
i can see that
there's something important going on right now for him
it could be that there is a hawk nearby but
i don't get that impression that something else that he's concerned about
and he's quite concerned
of course i am a bit distracted
because i am speaking
and when i'm speaking
i'm less sensitive
i will return in a moment
so
it's important to be sensitive in the moment
to what's going on right here right now
it's not that we want to necessarily exclude
food previously obtained knowledge models categories ideas
but rather that we need to know when it's time to set those down and sense right now
with our bodies and our hearts and our minds
what's going on right here right now
and when i noticed that my companion my friend ifaros
was concerned about something
it's not possible for me to just go on talking
i want to understand i'm going to need to shift my awareness
and open the gates of my senses
sometimes this requires branching away from language concepts ideas
letting those settle into the background
so that other forms of awareness
older forms and other sensitivities and surface and consciousness
now i wasn't able to discover yet what
what ifaros is concerned about today
but it's very clear that something's different
something's up in his world that isn't immediately apparent to me
and at the moment he's not with me so i can't sense with him
although it is possible
to sense at a distance
with those
with whom we are in deep relation
and i'm very concerned
when something is troubling my friend
i can't always help and sometimes my desire to help can backfire
and turn into a path toward harm and this is deeply troubling to me
and if my senses were really good
then i like to think oh i could sense that and divert danger
but when i relate with living beings there is a danger i'm a huge confused animal
i'm used to my everyday experience of relating with faros and other beings
in the contexts that i'm used to
and so
it's easy for me to become distracted in such a way
that i inadvertently cause harm or i am not active in averting harm
now of course
these ideas of harm and help have
they're familiar to us and they seem commonplace but they actually have a strange aspect of scope
that we ordinarily don't recognize which is that we cannot see into the future
and if we cannot see into the future we cannot really tell what is going on now
or rather
the scope of harm and help is temporally close to now
so we cannot really tell if for example
if i help my friend avert a car accident today
let's say i am a passenger in the car and i say whoa stop that person's running the light
and they stop and so the car that might otherwise have hit us zooms past us
we both feel a great sense of relief maybe we laugh because we're you know offloading some
adrenaline or something life goes on right that all seems good
what about that would not be good right certainly we don't want to be hit by the car running the red
light but what we cannot know or at least what we don't know how to sense yet
and different people in different circumstances have different sensing abilities
some people might be able to sense deeply into time there are stories of this kind of sensing
but what we don't know is what would have happened or not happened if we had been hit
by the car running the red light
surely we'd have both been injured
one or both of us may have died there
but because we were not injured different futures arise
and some of these could be far worse than us getting hit by the car and we can't tell
so the appearance of something being good or helpful now
it's it's a that appearance is temporally local right it's very local in time and we cannot see
the sequelae in the future and this is one of the great difficulties of believing in the kind of
thinking that we ordinarily do which is different from sensing
it's a kind of accounting game but it does not admit its own limitations
and we would be far more capable of intelligence if we learned to admit the limitations
we might still engage in such thinking but we would realize that its scope is limited
it's not necessarily authoritative
so you know this is what i mean when i speak about my own naivete in relation
i can't really tell what will be harmful or helpful
i have habits and histories of habit ways of thinking that are familiar to me
and also i can tell what feels good in the moment what feels right in the moment
if i'm willing to listen but how deeply am i listening and what am i listening to really
am i really listening to this place right now right here these beings in this moment
or am i listening to my ideas
often i may make an offering to an animal or a living place
and the offering is made with a kind of innocence
it's made some from habit and some from heart
but that offering could be harmful and it is dangerous
it's dangerous for the animals to relate with humans
right at that moment
i don't know if you heard it i was struck from above on my left shoulder
by a piece of bark falling from a tree is that meaningful
is there a message there
unfortunately because i'm busy talking it's much more difficult for me to tell
and our pattern matching abilities for all their incredible usefulness in our common human layer
circumstance
can easily become misled
we can
we can find ourselves in a state of apophonic confusion
where correlations swarm in our minds
and we imagine
situations circumstances messages
synchronicities they're often called and you know this topic of synchronicity is deep
but it's also quite confusing because our pattern matching minds
can easily find themselves in a situation where
we can't tell the difference between a meaningful signal and a signal we are producing
our minds are producing as a result of their often overcharged capacity to see connections
and to ascribe meaning to these connections
and this is the basis of various kinds of
mental
and emotional
confusion or illness
see a moment to go i saw the shadow of a bird
i could not find the bird but i sensed the bird was observing me
so even though i could not find it i made a little offering and the bird emerged to receive it
and there was you know a meaningful pattern matching there i saw the shadow
i know this shadow even though i glimpsed it only briefly and only peripherally
i knew which kind of bird this is and that it was observing me
and in a sense it had communicated with me because it could easily have approached by
stealth if it wished merely to observe me
and to be itself unobserved
observation is a big factor in all of these matters
not one that i have the time to delve into deeply here
but one of the issues with what we understand is coincidence
is that the coincidence we tend to perceive it in the world
but we are the local we are the locus of the coincidence and our imagination is the theater
of coincidence if we do not imagine connections messages and meanings
then we don't experience them unless they're extremely overt right
if the ground suddenly starts shaking severely
i don't have to have much imagining right the earth is shaking
this is significant it's blatant it's obvious it's dangerous
but the bark falling on my shoulder is much more ambiguous and in that ambiguity
our imagination can become tangled in the possibilities
and in promoting certain possibilities to probabilities
and then perhaps very carelessly or recklessly promoting what seems to us to be probabilities
into facts and this is much like the mind of someone experiencing schizophrenia
there's a sort of hyperconnective overdrive
