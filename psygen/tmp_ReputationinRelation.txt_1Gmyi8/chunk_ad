in the pattern matching aspects of cognition
and i have some experience of this kind of thing and there are different flavors of it
um paranoid schizophrenia is an aspect of
what we might think of as mental disorganization that sees threats everywhere
and there's an opposite kind which might be something like ecstatic schizophrenia
in which all of the signals
and patterns point toward beauty or our own incredible importance or that
perhaps for example someone thinks themselves a messiah
or the most important person or you know they think they are a very important person
they become megalomaniacal
and all of these things are natural potentials of our way of being in the world
and they are fascinating to explore but they can be catastrophic to experience
they can destroy our lives or our relationships or our minds
in the sense of ruining their otherwise ordinary coherence
sometimes temporarily sometimes permanently
our minds are delicate manifolds
they're vulnerable to various kinds of distortions some of which
is profoundly useful insight can be seen as a kind of distortion of consciousness
but so is paranoia
it can be profoundly exciting to experience mania
and for some people this experience is primarily creative
in some circumstances and for other people in other circumstances this experience
is devastating even though it can appear on the surface to be beautiful and profound
so i just like to call back to mind the importance of employing non-allness
in our thinking when we hear statements like
men are blah blah blah women are blah blah blah people are blah blah blah
we're seeing an experience of the opposite of non-allness we collapse the entire category
into a single point which by the way is a status that is impossible not only is it not true
it's not possible for that to be true
and in fact if we look very closely and we think carefully
we will find that most statements in language are not possible for them to be true
statements about truth in language are of an order that is different from truth in experience
and different from truth in being different from truth in relation
and that status is vastly lesser right it's missing
um crucially important
features of dimensionality possibility play and by play i mean the way that
in which we are in experience or in relation the way in which that transforms experience
and relation and accounting and derivation and meanings that we draw
right in a state of ecstatic wonder we will have an entirely different experience of
identity meaning in relation than we will have if we're simply thinking in language
oh there's a tree oh there's a bird oh the flower is pretty
right this uh
this strange linguistic overlay largely evicts us from deep and meaningful relation
and wonder awe participation in meaning rather than acting as the deriving arbiter of meaning
or identity or so on
if i see the bird
as an instance of all of the peoples
and then secondarily as an instance of all of the bird peoples and then all of the sparrow peoples
and then these lineages of sparrows if i imagine the bird this way my opportunities for relation
with it are very different from if i just say oh it's a sparrow take a picture onto the next thing
the living beings are doorways into awareness not just of our own nature but of nature
and origin relation communion all of these things unless we make the door so narrow
that only theories and ideas can enter or emerge and in this case we've suffered a tragic
circumcision an amputation loss
so although the living beings are aware that humans are generally dangerous they're also aware
that they can be uniquely wondrous
and friends companions co-beings we can go in the world together within for each other
and often when this sense prevails this is what is meant by magic right
but it's not really magic in the metaphysical sense it's magic in the sense of escaping the
cognitive overlays that would otherwise inhibit it it's like achieving a kind of escape velocity
from the gravity of earth's surface
so yes i was thinking of these things last night when i thought of the
the living beings as peoples and i also realized well they think of us as a people too
maybe although i don't know how much representational thinking may do but they're certainly capable
of thinking in their own ways ways unique to each of them and we can share in that thinking
when we connect with them or when we simply remove the divisions we can do the opposite
of connection right we can simply remove the barriers that might otherwise prevail
and then our senses the myriads of potentials of our sensing and relational
affinities right then these naturally surface and become accessible to us
so let us learn together not to think of identities as points right and collapse
them down into very simple
there's part of the problem
let's see
there's some territory issues today and the territory issues become more concerning
as we close in on uh
nesting time
hmm this is very complex i must pause to observe for a bit
hmm i think i have some sense now of what's going on but
i won't place too much trust in my thinking to keep watching keep feeling
so to bring it back to the beginning again
identities are shifting more like shifting topologies
and our own relation with them transforms them
our observation of them transforms them our participation in them transforms them
and the animals may be aware that the humans are dangerous but they're also aware
that it can be powerful and beneficial to have a friend in another universe
in the human universe this can be very powerful but also it's dangerous
and so too for us it can be very powerful to have a friend in the world of the bees or the trees
or the skunks or the beavers
but it can also be dangerous we can get hurt they can get hurt loving is risky
um and our intentions however
noble they may be however heartfelt they may be
can get us into trouble
when we're too used to thinking in a certain way and acting in a certain way and so we
stop paying attention to what's going on right here right now
today in the garden there's something different
and it may well be that the girl bird has laid eggs
and so Ivaros is acting as a sentry and has to pay really close attention
and make sure that he is aware of local threats and can repulse those threats which he's capable
of repulsing and that includes other birds of his own kind
though I suspect there's more to it than that
this is my sense of what what's going on today it's very busy managing the territory
so bear in mind that when we relate with other living things our reputation
is involved and it transforms and it spreads far and wide it may even spread across the
boundaries of a single lifetime most of what is true about being in relation is unknown to us
and vastly unlike what we think in language and models
and if we keep this in mind together then we will escape some of the traps that would otherwise
close their jaws on our our sensing
our capacity for deep relation our creativity
the beauty the resonant ancient beauty
that's the heart of our humanity
thank you for joining me today I look forward to learning together again very soon
bye bye for now
