Hello everybody. Welcome. As usual, I am walking in the gardens and there is a truly
astonishing diversity of living beings here, including this incredible gigantic sequoia
sequoia dendron gigantium sierra redwood but this one looks more like an upside down octopus
than a straight up and down redwood like we're used to seeing. It's an incredible organism.
Really beautiful.
It can be difficult here because
humans do things that don't make sense at all all the time. Right now they're chopping down
old trees many very old trees
to make room for what they're calling a greenhouse but they already had a greenhouse
and really they should not be stealing land in the gardens for this project
and there's not much I can do about it. The humans often do very ridiculous things here in the garden.
Of course we live in a city and so the imperatives of the city and of money
have precedence over the importance of the living beings and relationships in the gardens
and this is a similar problem that we have in our own lives.
The structured nonsense going on under the guise of civilization
intrudes and invades upon and torments
many aspects of our interiority and our humanity and our nature as organisms and beings
and it's tragic and it's heartbreaking.
Many of my closest friends struggle with terrible burdens
that have nothing to do with who they are or are not
but rather are the results of whether or not they fit into the bizarre artificial jigsaw
of modern culture and society and the imperatives that underlie it
and the vast majority of those imperatives are fundamentally toxic.
Of course we can learn how this all came to be and we can learn together
how to form minds and lives that establish a new in our time a new way of being human
and intelligent creative playful and loving together
and that's part of my my hope and my dream.
I was thinking I'm often thinking it's a problem for me I was thinking last night
about the video I made previously in which I spoke of the hall of four of a people
who are a people and in our own lives the question is important in various ways one
of them being who are my people who are those people who I feel
at home with recognized by seen by valued by loved by respected by
and in general everyone all the living beings are my people
but more specifically I am most at home with creative people artists writers
some intellectuals though though less than the others a little bit because
the intellectuals can be rather severe and confused when they uh
when they
depart from relation into language and concept
but I'm at home with intellectuals too a little less so the cultural creatives
the people who are deeply authentically creative these people we we tend to immediately recognize
each other and of course these are just words and categories actual situations
you know are much more diverse and rich
but yes writers and artists actors comedians dancers painters
musicians these are the people who I usually feel most at home with
and of course there are people who don't belong to any class who I also feel an immediate kinship
with right not because they have some specific quality or behavior but just because there's
an affinity there that is felt I feel it you know I was just talking with one of the
there's a few old scions of our neighborhood
one of whom is named Fred he's 90 but he's a very young 90
and he's you know a troublesome and brilliant man
and there's another man in my neighborhood both of these are older gay men
which is you know pretty common in my neighborhood where I live
since San Francisco is one of the
how to put this one of the um
historical origins of freedom
for people who are gay or differently oriented uniquely oriented of course they would say
I'm differently oriented what is difference and when do we when do we insert that idea
right different different from what but um San Francisco is one of the birthplaces of gay culture
and so we have a few
beautiful old people yeah and I was just speaking with uh with Richard
and his parrot Sherman who's a very gentle animal I got to have him on my arm for a bit
we were in a cafe together and I'd spoken with him a few times before
he's a heartfelt and intelligent man
he's got to be probably closing in on 80
there may be some wind noise for a bit I apologize it's not much I can do about it
in any case I was thinking last night about my previous video
and some things that I could add to it um
in that video I spoke about the holofore of what are a people
and how in my own life
I came to understand
that the organisms all of the organisms of earth are peoples
and once I understood this a lot of things changed for me in how I
saw and related with the living world because with peoples
you know uh in how we relate with them
over time and in unique situations we can acquire a relationship excuse me what I meant was
obviously we embody a relationship but we can acquire a reputation
and so if I am kind and gentle with the bees and if I occasionally help one of them or rescue one
word word gets out
so that all the bees that I encounter relate with me in a sense according to my reputation
but also not just that according to how I am treating them in the moment there is both right
there's both who is this person with me right now who are they being right now
and we have the same thing in in our human world
who are they being right now and who do I know them as you know how are they known
what are they known for and what are they known for this is the idea of reputation
I'd like to know more about the etymological origins of that word repute
and clearly there's a there's a phoneme there from other words like
represent repudiate
reprehensible most of these are are words with rather grim associations or connotations
but yes once once I realized that the living beings were peoples
then I began to learn that we acquire a reputation that spreads
beyond a given encounter with some plant or animal or living place or group of beings
and there are a number of specific beings I have close relations with
the bees ants and wasps the whales dolphins squids and octopuses
the spiders and praying mantises especially the jumping spiders
the corvids the crows ravens magpies blue jays hawks
the canadian geese the white cheeks ops beanie in blackfoot
sage plant rosemary plant the lavender plant
the sour grass
clover flowers
all of these beings the sparrows
the blackbirds hummingbirds bumblebees jasmine
honeysuckle salveas cactuses lizards and snakes of diverse kinds
the bats
and there are many more I mean all of the beings are my friends
I don't know all their names I don't know all their names
and I don't much like the English names
English names are leaving something out that's very important
which is what is the nature of our relationship over time the humans and these beings
many older languages contain in the names
hints about the relationships and also there are old stories about when animals or plants
helped our people in times of crisis or fear or need and also when we helped them
so what I was thinking last night as I was reflecting briefly on the video that I'd made
the recording anyway
was something having to do with an aspect of cognitive activism
that probably wasn't initially introduced by Alfred Korzybski but was uniquely
elaborated by him and it's an idea called non-allness
right and in our cognition in our habits with language and concepts
we have a lazy weakness of vulnerability that's often captured by
agents or
associations corporations governments and so on
the media and the weakness is to think of all instances of a class in one way
and to suppose that that way completely captures what's important about them
right so if we think about trees for example all trees are trees seems very straightforward
completely untrue vastly untrue true in language and concept not true in relation
the tree under which I sheltered in the rain
for a time while the rain passed I'm looking at this tree right now with love protected me
it's not the same as all other trees and the trees who I adore and have deep relations with
I can think of a few of them now not the same right they're not they're not regular instances
of the class a tree who speaks in your mind suddenly unexpectedly
will transform everything you ever thought about anything and trust me this happens
trees can speak but not in language they speak in emotion they speak in
in interiority the flows the ebbs the floods the waters of our interiority
and so all trees are trees only in language but they are beings in my heart
and if they are beings then you can see the dimensionality of the relational possibilities
explodes infinitely into infinity there is no limit
so non-allness is a really important principle to understand and keep
close to our awareness when we are thinking in terms of categories or when we are reading language
or when people are making declarations or assertions or arguments
non-allness simply points at the necessary and significant incompleteness of language
and the reason I bring this up is that when I think of identity most most people many people
are trained to think of identity as point like right it's one thing it's a tree
but the trees like like ourselves we are all beings instanced in a unique form we are the
universe instanced in a unique local embodied form and so the idea of a tree is insufficient to
capture the identity and nature of what this word points at
so we're trained to think in point like ways we'll think oh this kind of person is a bad person
this other kind of person is a good person this other kind of person is someone I can ignore
but kinds of people are transient
the classes do not capture what they point at and in fact they evict most of it
and so what I was thinking just to return for a moment the opposite of one of the opposites
of a point that's more useful is its apology right if you if you're driving somewhere a flat
road map will help you right it will show you routes but if you are hiking somewhere what
you need is a topological map because you need to know elevations you need to know the differences
in the terrain right for the sake of the car the flat map is sufficient for the sake of someone on
foot the flat map is insufficient and in relationships it's much more like being on foot
we have to see the peaks and valleys
and our language captures this almost not at all very poorly in general unless we're careful
in which case it's a little better
so what I was thinking last night was
you know it's true that the animals know and the insects know and perhaps the plants know
and that the humans are very dangerous
often confused sometimes cruel and part of why they are dangerous and cruel and confused
is because their ideas about living beings are mostly broken
over time they've suffered terrible amputations of relational dimensionality opportunity co-being
and this is the process that I refer to as the flattening of our our concepts into tokens
and tokenization and this is natural for a species that lives in its head
is oriented toward turning relationships into commodities and transactions
and has lost the lion's share of their interiority to these processes over time
but the animals and insects don't only see us by class
and we are often inclined to see them by class
this rosemary plant that I adore old rosemary plant
and the little spiders running on the ground next to it
they are my own heart they are my own body they are my friends they are my family
the many people this would sound bizarre to the plants don't talk they don't give you things
they don't you know it's not if this is true the plants do speak in fact their very forms are
exquisitely beautiful I'm tasting the sweetness of the nectar in the salvia flower right now
and in so doing I join with this plant with gratitude and reverence with love
so the animals and the living beings in the living places they're aware
of the generality of humans humans are dangerous often confused
and they can be cruel and again the reason is that they're
they're sort of sleepwalking in the world most of us be myself included
many of the things I can speak about I can only partially embody even though I can see them
and my capacity to embody them depends on many things that
they don't entirely lie beyond my control but I too am influenced by context and habit and
and like all beings I hitchhike on the momentums that have precedence around me
but the the living beings are also aware of non-allness in the sense that
although they they may have some kind of implicit instinctual concern about humans
probably due to thousands of years of evolutionary experience with our life form
they're also aware under some circumstances
that not all humans are that way all the time
and this is an example of non-allness
animals who have a history of long relation with our species
bees are an animal like this
but so too are all of the synanthropes
corvids skunks possums raccoon squirrels mice rats
cats and dogs cats and dogs are not you know they've been
we use the word domesticated it's kind of a strange word but they've become our preferred symbionts
and cats and dogs may be terrified of humans if they've had bad experiences
but they may also be playfully fascinated and interested in relating with us
and loving they can directly demonstrate what is obviously love
it's not a question they're not simulating love they love they're being love
and so the animals and the plants and the living places reserve whatever way they may be concerned
about our kind of animal in the world they reserve a place within that concern
for the exceptions right the humans who care and to our gentle who love
who have reverence and respect for other living beings
and some humans have to learn this I guess though this was not so much the case with me
I was pretty much born this way
but I even in my loving early years right even as a child when I was small
my human ideas could overwhelm my intelligence and I would expect for example that
I could take the fish with me and it would be my friend if I put it in my pocket
which led to tragedy from the fish for sure and my heart because I was crushed to discover
I had harmed or killed the being that I loved by wanting to take it with me and have it with
me all the time and I thought they can be my pets I was confused in that in this way between the
inward and the outward right it's safe to take them with me in my heart it's not safe to take
them with me in my pocket and I honor with reverence the memory of those little fishes
that I once put in my pocket thinking I want them with me always
for I learned a difficult lesson with them and other other beings
I had to make terrible mistakes in my life
to understand the difference between how the humans are trained to think
and act and what's actually possible and true and going on
some of those lessons still sting and even though I'm older now and have some experience
that's broad and rich I still make mistakes I can still be frightened or confused
and some of those mistakes are very painful for me
when my confusion causes the death or suffering of other beings
still happens but my point was ha that's funny actually my topology was
that in relating with living beings as instances of a people right this tree here is not just an
instance of the tree people it's an instance of all beings it's an instance of vegetal beings
it's an instance of tree beings it's an interest it's excuse me an instance of its phenotype
right the kind of tree that it is and many other things that we don't even have language for
so no concept can capture it or or convey it
but if we're going to choose one it's better to choose one with more dimensionality than with
less because as we exclude the dimensionalities of being we exclude the possibilities of our own
minds and our own relational roles and capacities
so I was thinking last night that although the animals and living places in plants recognize
humans as a as a serious threat a very dangerous animal I mean nothing's really as dangerous as
a human except maybe lightning or volcanoes or something bombs I don't know asteroids
but although they although they see us and recognize us as a threat they are also aware that
they have to pay attention to the uniqueness of the human in front of them
in the moment in situation in which they are together
and thus you will often see you know which apparently humans find this very surprising
I find it beautiful but not surprising you'll see animals helping one another that would ordinarily
not they would ordinarily ignore each other or perhaps be aggressive toward each other
or you will see animals helping humans or you will see humans helping animals
and this is you know it's beautiful it's natural because all beings are beings
so even though the humans are understood to be dangerous in general as a class
right the living places and beings pay attention to the unique situation at hand with this human
or these humans right here right now and this is why you see things like the grizzly man
right the guy who hung out with the grizzly bears though he made I think a serious mistake
that may have led to his death and it's an interesting mistake and I can't be sure what
happened with him I don't know for certain but as was unlike his previous habit he brought
a female companion with him to an island where he knew there were specific bears
that were quite aggressive and in thinking about this I just remember one day my girlfriend and I
we walked into a donut store and there was a young woman with a pretty large fierce looking pit bull
and as we walked in the pit bull became very disturbed and
somewhat aggressive and its and its owner said oh wow that's so strange he never does this
he's never liked this and I took that seriously so I thought about it for a moment
and when we walked outside I asked my girlfriend Coco a brilliant soul she was
I said to her are you on your period and she said yes I started a couple days ago
and that made me think ah you know these predators the dogs and the bears they sense blood
they can smell blood from a long way away and I don't know that that's the explanation of the
dogs discomfort and nor do I know that that was the problem that got the grizzly man killed
can't recall his name but he should have thought twice about bringing his female companion to a
place where there are grizzly bears because it's not the same he doesn't bleed and she does
and again I don't know you know if this was the actual problem it could have been something else
and you can see how once like once one has an idea
of an explanation for something there's a propensity to just see that way and think oh yes
this is the answer but we have to have non-allness there too we have to realize
that's an interesting idea reasonable possible might not be the problem though
but I wonder about what happened with him the grizzly man and his female companion
I wonder if she had her period and it aggravated or you know woke up something in the bears
that might not have otherwise occurred
and again this is the thing of paying attention to specifics
right the fact that the bears are fine with him and won't hurt him usually
is not true when the equation so to speak changes we have to pay attention to the
unique particulars I wonder if he thought you know he must have known that the grizzlies are very
sensitive to blood and as predators hello they uh
they have a an affinity
they will seek out animals that are bleeding because those animals are often injured
and are not just easier to kill sometimes this may sound strange and it's a weird way of putting it
sometimes the injured animals need help dying
right and the bear can kill them very quickly
and it's just important to be aware that
animals like sharks bears dogs some cats
they will their personality will transform dramatically
if blood is in the water if the scent of blood is in the air
and I'm pretty sure grizzlies can detect that sense at incredible distances
and you know they're what we usually refer to as apex predators
they're at the top of the food chain nothing hunts grizzly bears except humans
nothing much hunts sharks the occasional orca might get involved with that
other sharks might get involved but only humans pretty much hunt sharks
so
so I was thinking last night about all non-allness and about how
when we relate with the living peoples we acquire a reputation that spreads far and wide
I don't know the explicit extent of its spread
but it would not surprise me to find that it was kind of universal that it it might even be
so universal as to escape temporal locality
and follow us through many lives presuming that something like reincarnation
is going on and I think there is something that resembles it going on but it's probably much
more complex than the way we think about it because I don't I'm not a fan of the I point
like idea of a soul I'm a fan of the topology idea of a soul where there are sort of a soul
is a constellation of relationships outside of time instanced locally in a given being
and all of these things fit together and sort of support each other in my mind in my thoughts
all of the living beings have what I would call non-ordinary senses of course they're
entirely ordinary the only place they're not ordinary is in our ways of thinking that exclude
them and many people will say well these are spiritual things okay I'm not terribly opposed
to the idea but they're fundamentally relational things
they don't require fancy metaphysics and we don't have to explain them and many of them
are probably inexplicable in the models and language and conceptual milieu
that we're accustomed to as formal representational cognitives in the modern age
it's clear to me when I relate with bees physically with my hands
that they are aware of my reputation and they're also aware of the character of my interiority
in fact if humans wanted to understand whether minds can touch each other or not
a really amazing potential here has been overlooked which is that in terms of cell mass
we are enormous of course whales are much bigger than us and there are other animals
that are larger in living places are enormous compared to us but
in terms of cell mass
a human has probably I don't know 50 trillion cells maybe 25 trillion of which are bacterial
come from the world 25 trillion of which approximately are eukaryotes come from our
gene line and our mitochondrial line so
if size matters in this way and I suggest that it does and we wanted to find out whether we
could touch other minds all right the first place to look or a really good place to look
would be how are very tiny creatures affected by our local presence
can we touch the minds of insects I would start there of course if we really wanted to take it
to its nth degree we could you know use microscopes and determine if we can touch
the being the essential being of microorganisms which I strongly suspect we can I have good
reasons to suspect that from experiment but with insects a class that of organisms that humans
usually ignore think of as trivial which is ironic since their biomass vastly exceeds our own
on the planet which also means their sensing mass vastly vastly exceeds ours
the insect populations are aware of subtleties in the character of environments in the sun the moon
the weather the chemical makeup of atmospheres that humans will never approach
no matter what instruments we build
and so that great sensitivity provides an opportunity
and I've witnessed things that seem to me miraculous
uh-huh there's Zephardos chasing his his enemy
yeah
chasing him off
defending his territory
he shows his force his power by
by pecking the branches on the tree that his enemy has settled in well it's not exactly his
enemy it's too simple a language but the one who is intruding the stellar is Jay
you see he's using distributed communication he could yell at his enemy
or his the interloper but instead he taps a branch on a tree and if you
if you've not had this experience it's really quite profound because
sometimes the jays when I first arrive in a place where they know me and I place my palm
against a tree because I'm connecting with the tree the jays will land on the tree and
tap tap tap tap tap tap and I'll feel the pulse of that tapping in the wood and it's a visceral
very powerful feeling you can feel the physical power of the animal
and it seems to me the males are more um oriented toward this behavior but
both both of them the male and the female both employ it and it's not just to drive off enemies
it's also a way of communicating right because the the stellar's jays in this case
are not trying to drive me off they're trying to welcome me they're saying hello
but yes if we wanted to understand something about
do mines touch one of the places we might start is with very small creatures
and seeing if our minds can influence the very small creatures if they can sense us
if they can sense our intention or if we can communicate with them with our minds
and I've experienced astonishing things in this regard I remember um one year
a female a queen paper wasp awoke too early it was too cold and I could tell she was struggling
it would not survive I felt so I brought her in my home and I had a cage I could put her in
for a while and I fed her um mostly I made sure she had water and sugar water she probably needed
other things but then one day it became very clear that it was time to let her go right it was warm
enough now she would survive and I had to negotiate getting her out of the cage and into the sunlight
she needed the sunlight to warm her body so that she could fly
and um Coco was with me on this day and we opened the cage and I I spoke to her in language but
I was using my imagination I pictured what I was saying and I gave her a series of directions you
know walk over to this edge of the cage climb up on this stick and I will take you into the sun
and don't fly off with the stick because I need to get you into the sun and
she followed each of my directions explicitly and Coco was shocked even though you know she's a
she was an unusually minded beautiful human being and I myself was surprised because
the insect followed essentially five consecutive directives
instantaneously and without deviation
how did she know
but I have lots of relationships with insects where this kind of thing happens all the time
though usually not so explicitly there are many small insects who are my friends
who I form relationships with I remember when I was a young child
maybe seven or eight in our backyard in Stockton which had been made out of farmland
what had been farmland for many years so when we first got there there were many spiders and
praying mantises and insects though DDT was going to change that right quick in any case
there was a huge orb weaver I mean honestly with her leg spread she was probably almost as big as
my face her abdomen was probably three quarters the size of an egg she was huge she could eat small
birds I never saw her do that she lived in our backyard for a while and although this is a little
I feel a little bit sad for the moths now but I used to catch these grass moths in my hands and I
would hold them up to her web and she would climb down on my hand and very gently very gingerly take
them off and bite it and carry it back into her web and wrap it up and eat it and she came to know me
this way and I came to know her and my parents were quite nervous but I wasn't concerned because I knew
she was my friend and I had not dissimilar relationships with black widow spiders when I
was a child spider that everyone thinks of as deadly I used to have a a false bunk so that
there was more room in my in my bedroom and my father built for me so my bed was up near the
ceiling and in one year black widow which I was you know obviously I was friendly with these
spiders in general and this is the thing about having a reputation right among a people living
people um one year a black widow made its nest right above where I slept in the corner of the
ceiling and my parents were extremely upset about this like ah that's not we're not letting that
happen you're going to take that out and I said don't you dare touch that spider
of course she and I you know she was my companion she was my friend every night I would look up and
see her and I wasn't afraid and she knew I respected her and there was no problem there
but eventually she made an egg case and that that was a problem I don't recall how we solved it
I like to think we solved it in a beautiful way but it seems unlikely that we could have
I don't think we killed the egg case I probably put it in a jar and let them hatch and let them go but
we couldn't have hundreds of baby black widows right where my bed is because they're gonna
they're gonna you know they're well they'll distribute themselves
but yes I've had many adventures with small creatures and if we wanted to understand whether
our minds or our souls or something within us can directly touch the being of other of other
creatures which I am absolutely certain that it does and it can but if we wanted to experiment
there's ifaros making his greeting display he zooms by my face
one moment
if we wanted to understand this then we could experiment with very small creatures because
the consciousness mass of our cell mass is like a galaxy I don't know how many cells
comprise an ant or a bee or a wasp or a spider
but it's probably something like one ten millionth or one trillionth of the cell mass of our bodies
and so we must appear to them relationally is like a galaxy compared to I don't know a star
and so if we want to understand whether we can directly communicate with other beings
the very small beings are a good place to start
but yes the humans represent a danger but not only a danger also an opportunity
for communion reunion co-being friendship companionship and we have to be sensitive
you know as I was not as a child right to the differences
in our way of being in the world as compared with an ant or a bee or a spider or a wasp or a bird
or a mouse or a tree or a living place
and we have to be careful of taking them into our world
because our world is not friendly to children and hearts and spirits living beings
our world tends to make of them commodities representations
you go to the toy store and you'll see we don't just represent the animals as toys
we represent the humans as toys too
all of the beings
we represent them
so our world is dangerous for them I can't put the fish in my pocket and take them with me
hmm
and when we treat the other beings with kindness and reverence and respect
adoration
word gets around
in the living library of beings on earth
we come to be known
you know we have the capacity to come to be known
as a good companion a good friend
and
as someone beloved
you know I I talk with the bees
in my heart and my imagination and sometimes with my words
and they return the favor but not in ordinary language
while we're awake the structure of our minds
is not conducive
generally
to exploring the living library the cognizium of the beings on earth
which the human cognizium is a sub array of
so over time you know we acquire a reputation
and for some of us that's no reputation
we're just like any other human most of the time
but when we engage heartfully and attentively
with wonder and mutual concern reverence respect
then we come to be recognized
by all the living beings in the living places
everyone knows that an encounter with a bear
or another apex predator wolf pack
it's a danger it's dangerous we could get hurt we could be killed these are predators
but that's only provisionally true
in the right state of mind those beings become extensions of our own bodies and hearts
and will not harm us
because they will recognize in us
communion
the possibility of friendship companionship
ifaros
he's paying very close attention to something
he is aware of something i cannot see but by attending him my mind changes
though i do not yet see what is concerning him
i can see that
there's something important going on right now for him
it could be that there is a hawk nearby but
i don't get that impression that something else that he's concerned about
and he's quite concerned
of course i am a bit distracted
because i am speaking
and when i'm speaking
i'm less sensitive
i will return in a moment
so
it's important to be sensitive in the moment
to what's going on right here right now
it's not that we want to necessarily exclude
food previously obtained knowledge models categories ideas
but rather that we need to know when it's time to set those down and sense right now
with our bodies and our hearts and our minds
what's going on right here right now
and when i noticed that my companion my friend ifaros
was concerned about something
it's not possible for me to just go on talking
i want to understand i'm going to need to shift my awareness
and open the gates of my senses
sometimes this requires branching away from language concepts ideas
letting those settle into the background
so that other forms of awareness
older forms and other sensitivities and surface and consciousness
now i wasn't able to discover yet what
what ifaros is concerned about today
but it's very clear that something's different
something's up in his world that isn't immediately apparent to me
and at the moment he's not with me so i can't sense with him
although it is possible
to sense at a distance
with those
with whom we are in deep relation
and i'm very concerned
when something is troubling my friend
i can't always help and sometimes my desire to help can backfire
and turn into a path toward harm and this is deeply troubling to me
and if my senses were really good
then i like to think oh i could sense that and divert danger
but when i relate with living beings there is a danger i'm a huge confused animal
i'm used to my everyday experience of relating with faros and other beings
in the contexts that i'm used to
and so
it's easy for me to become distracted in such a way
that i inadvertently cause harm or i am not active in averting harm
now of course
these ideas of harm and help have
they're familiar to us and they seem commonplace but they actually have a strange aspect of scope
that we ordinarily don't recognize which is that we cannot see into the future
and if we cannot see into the future we cannot really tell what is going on now
or rather
the scope of harm and help is temporally close to now
so we cannot really tell if for example
if i help my friend avert a car accident today
let's say i am a passenger in the car and i say whoa stop that person's running the light
and they stop and so the car that might otherwise have hit us zooms past us
we both feel a great sense of relief maybe we laugh because we're you know offloading some
adrenaline or something life goes on right that all seems good
what about that would not be good right certainly we don't want to be hit by the car running the red
light but what we cannot know or at least what we don't know how to sense yet
and different people in different circumstances have different sensing abilities
some people might be able to sense deeply into time there are stories of this kind of sensing
but what we don't know is what would have happened or not happened if we had been hit
by the car running the red light
surely we'd have both been injured
one or both of us may have died there
but because we were not injured different futures arise
and some of these could be far worse than us getting hit by the car and we can't tell
so the appearance of something being good or helpful now
it's it's a that appearance is temporally local right it's very local in time and we cannot see
the sequelae in the future and this is one of the great difficulties of believing in the kind of
thinking that we ordinarily do which is different from sensing
it's a kind of accounting game but it does not admit its own limitations
and we would be far more capable of intelligence if we learned to admit the limitations
we might still engage in such thinking but we would realize that its scope is limited
it's not necessarily authoritative
so you know this is what i mean when i speak about my own naivete in relation
i can't really tell what will be harmful or helpful
i have habits and histories of habit ways of thinking that are familiar to me
and also i can tell what feels good in the moment what feels right in the moment
if i'm willing to listen but how deeply am i listening and what am i listening to really
am i really listening to this place right now right here these beings in this moment
or am i listening to my ideas
often i may make an offering to an animal or a living place
and the offering is made with a kind of innocence
it's made some from habit and some from heart
but that offering could be harmful and it is dangerous
it's dangerous for the animals to relate with humans
right at that moment
i don't know if you heard it i was struck from above on my left shoulder
by a piece of bark falling from a tree is that meaningful
is there a message there
unfortunately because i'm busy talking it's much more difficult for me to tell
and our pattern matching abilities for all their incredible usefulness in our common human layer
circumstance
can easily become misled
we can
we can find ourselves in a state of apophonic confusion
where correlations swarm in our minds
and we imagine
situations circumstances messages
synchronicities they're often called and you know this topic of synchronicity is deep
but it's also quite confusing because our pattern matching minds
can easily find themselves in a situation where
we can't tell the difference between a meaningful signal and a signal we are producing
our minds are producing as a result of their often overcharged capacity to see connections
and to ascribe meaning to these connections
and this is the basis of various kinds of
mental
and emotional
confusion or illness
see a moment to go i saw the shadow of a bird
i could not find the bird but i sensed the bird was observing me
so even though i could not find it i made a little offering and the bird emerged to receive it
and there was you know a meaningful pattern matching there i saw the shadow
i know this shadow even though i glimpsed it only briefly and only peripherally
i knew which kind of bird this is and that it was observing me
and in a sense it had communicated with me because it could easily have approached by
stealth if it wished merely to observe me
and to be itself unobserved
observation is a big factor in all of these matters
not one that i have the time to delve into deeply here
but one of the issues with what we understand is coincidence
is that the coincidence we tend to perceive it in the world
but we are the local we are the locus of the coincidence and our imagination is the theater
of coincidence if we do not imagine connections messages and meanings
then we don't experience them unless they're extremely overt right
if the ground suddenly starts shaking severely
i don't have to have much imagining right the earth is shaking
this is significant it's blatant it's obvious it's dangerous
but the bark falling on my shoulder is much more ambiguous and in that ambiguity
our imagination can become tangled in the possibilities
and in promoting certain possibilities to probabilities
and then perhaps very carelessly or recklessly promoting what seems to us to be probabilities
into facts and this is much like the mind of someone experiencing schizophrenia
there's a sort of hyperconnective overdrive
in the pattern matching aspects of cognition
and i have some experience of this kind of thing and there are different flavors of it
um paranoid schizophrenia is an aspect of
what we might think of as mental disorganization that sees threats everywhere
and there's an opposite kind which might be something like ecstatic schizophrenia
in which all of the signals
and patterns point toward beauty or our own incredible importance or that
perhaps for example someone thinks themselves a messiah
or the most important person or you know they think they are a very important person
they become megalomaniacal
and all of these things are natural potentials of our way of being in the world
and they are fascinating to explore but they can be catastrophic to experience
they can destroy our lives or our relationships or our minds
in the sense of ruining their otherwise ordinary coherence
sometimes temporarily sometimes permanently
our minds are delicate manifolds
they're vulnerable to various kinds of distortions some of which
is profoundly useful insight can be seen as a kind of distortion of consciousness
but so is paranoia
it can be profoundly exciting to experience mania
and for some people this experience is primarily creative
in some circumstances and for other people in other circumstances this experience
is devastating even though it can appear on the surface to be beautiful and profound
so i just like to call back to mind the importance of employing non-allness
in our thinking when we hear statements like
men are blah blah blah women are blah blah blah people are blah blah blah
we're seeing an experience of the opposite of non-allness we collapse the entire category
into a single point which by the way is a status that is impossible not only is it not true
it's not possible for that to be true
and in fact if we look very closely and we think carefully
we will find that most statements in language are not possible for them to be true
statements about truth in language are of an order that is different from truth in experience
and different from truth in being different from truth in relation
and that status is vastly lesser right it's missing
um crucially important
features of dimensionality possibility play and by play i mean the way that
in which we are in experience or in relation the way in which that transforms experience
and relation and accounting and derivation and meanings that we draw
right in a state of ecstatic wonder we will have an entirely different experience of
identity meaning in relation than we will have if we're simply thinking in language
oh there's a tree oh there's a bird oh the flower is pretty
right this uh
this strange linguistic overlay largely evicts us from deep and meaningful relation
and wonder awe participation in meaning rather than acting as the deriving arbiter of meaning
or identity or so on
if i see the bird
as an instance of all of the peoples
and then secondarily as an instance of all of the bird peoples and then all of the sparrow peoples
and then these lineages of sparrows if i imagine the bird this way my opportunities for relation
with it are very different from if i just say oh it's a sparrow take a picture onto the next thing
the living beings are doorways into awareness not just of our own nature but of nature
and origin relation communion all of these things unless we make the door so narrow
that only theories and ideas can enter or emerge and in this case we've suffered a tragic
circumcision an amputation loss
so although the living beings are aware that humans are generally dangerous they're also aware
that they can be uniquely wondrous
and friends companions co-beings we can go in the world together within for each other
and often when this sense prevails this is what is meant by magic right
but it's not really magic in the metaphysical sense it's magic in the sense of escaping the
cognitive overlays that would otherwise inhibit it it's like achieving a kind of escape velocity
from the gravity of earth's surface
so yes i was thinking of these things last night when i thought of the
the living beings as peoples and i also realized well they think of us as a people too
maybe although i don't know how much representational thinking may do but they're certainly capable
of thinking in their own ways ways unique to each of them and we can share in that thinking
when we connect with them or when we simply remove the divisions we can do the opposite
of connection right we can simply remove the barriers that might otherwise prevail
and then our senses the myriads of potentials of our sensing and relational
affinities right then these naturally surface and become accessible to us
so let us learn together not to think of identities as points right and collapse
them down into very simple
there's part of the problem
let's see
there's some territory issues today and the territory issues become more concerning
as we close in on uh
nesting time
hmm this is very complex i must pause to observe for a bit
hmm i think i have some sense now of what's going on but
i won't place too much trust in my thinking to keep watching keep feeling
so to bring it back to the beginning again
identities are shifting more like shifting topologies
and our own relation with them transforms them
our observation of them transforms them our participation in them transforms them
and the animals may be aware that the humans are dangerous but they're also aware
that it can be powerful and beneficial to have a friend in another universe
in the human universe this can be very powerful but also it's dangerous
and so too for us it can be very powerful to have a friend in the world of the bees or the trees
or the skunks or the beavers
but it can also be dangerous we can get hurt they can get hurt loving is risky
um and our intentions however
noble they may be however heartfelt they may be
can get us into trouble
when we're too used to thinking in a certain way and acting in a certain way and so we
stop paying attention to what's going on right here right now
today in the garden there's something different
and it may well be that the girl bird has laid eggs
and so Ivaros is acting as a sentry and has to pay really close attention
and make sure that he is aware of local threats and can repulse those threats which he's capable
of repulsing and that includes other birds of his own kind
though I suspect there's more to it than that
this is my sense of what what's going on today it's very busy managing the territory
so bear in mind that when we relate with other living things our reputation
is involved and it transforms and it spreads far and wide it may even spread across the
boundaries of a single lifetime most of what is true about being in relation is unknown to us
and vastly unlike what we think in language and models
and if we keep this in mind together then we will escape some of the traps that would otherwise
close their jaws on our our sensing
our capacity for deep relation our creativity
the beauty the resonant ancient beauty
that's the heart of our humanity
thank you for joining me today I look forward to learning together again very soon
bye bye for now
