Yeah.
Yeah.
So anyway, these guys are going down south to,
uh, to raid their enemy or to raid their opponent,
the snake people.
And every time they sleep, the brothers, the cousins and stuff,
they start having their own dreams and their dreams aren't as nice.
Wow.
They're fearful dreams.
Wow.
They see themselves dying.
They see bad things happen, you know,
or they see, you know, they're scared when they wake up from
their dreams and so pretty soon, like, you know,
a couple of days in people start turning them back.
They're not, they're not going to participate, you know,
and his closest cousins and brothers stick with him further,
but eventually them too, they're just,
they're all having dreams that are ominous and bad, you know.
And, uh, they, they're like, Hey, man,
like we want to trust your dream and everything,
but like we got trust ours too.
And so, um, so they back off.
Uh, and he's like, all right, go ahead.
You know, my, uh, you know,
you know, my relatives are not worth anything.
Do you want to have some food? Go.
I have a, I have a dog here that's a pet sitting.
Ah, yes.
Who's been here now 24 hours and not eating.
Yeah.
You can't tell whether where the owner is if he gets to go home,
but if he's coming, why is this happening?
Oh, it's a great stress down.
There we go.
You're going to eat, aren't you? There you go, Jimmy.
Oh, um,
Oh, where are we?
His, his cousins have turned back.
Oh yeah.
Now he's on his own.
Yeah.
I'll child.
He's on his own.
And then a storm approaches.
He's decided in his mind, he's going to go.
Down to the opponents.
And he's just going to go write nuts on them.
And do, you know,
like he's probably going to die.
It's a suicide mission.
He's going to let them take his life because his,
he's so like him, you know,
humiliated and upset with his relatives for not continuing with him.
Anyway, the storm is coming.
And he finds a crag.
In some rock.
In the Coolies to climb into.
And you can go deep into this crag to get out of the weather.
But it gets, you know, dark, dark.
In there.
Pitch black dark.
In the cave.
And.
In that cave, he's kind of like, you know,
the storm is raging and shit outside and he's just kind of like
hanging out in the cave.
And then he bumps into something.
And he starts feeling it.
And then he realizes this, this is another fucking guy in here.
Like standing right here, you know.
And his heart's racing.
He doesn't know who the heck this is.
It could be an enemy anything.
He starts like frantically kind of feeling this guy.
He's already touched him and felt him up a little bit to like,
before he came to the realization that's a fucking person, you know.
So he starts touching him a little bit more to try to figure out.
Like, does he have anything on him that I can tell what,
you know, what kind of person this is.
Something like symbols and shit, you know.
And he can't find nothing.
In the dark.
And so ultimately he takes a risk.
And he goes like this.
And he rubs his fist on the guy's cheek.
Like this.
This is the sign for be gunny.
Which is his tribe.
He was telling him who he was.
Which is a huge risk.
And the other guy puts his finger on owl child's chest.
And does the zigzag.
Cross his chest.
And he's telling him he's bit sick.
See now.
The snake person.
That's their opponent.
And so again, like.
Owl child's heart starts racing.
Because he thinks this is it.
Like any second he's getting killed.
Or kill, kill or get killed, you know.
But he doesn't, he doesn't, he doesn't move on the guy.
And then they, they,
they keep trying to like use.
Sign language on each other's bodies.
To try to start communicating things.
And when the storm lets up, they go outside.
And they go full into playing sign language.
Which was the lingua franca.
Of the time, you know.
And.
They realize that they actually have super similar stories.
This guy was coming up north to raid them.
With his brothers and all that shit.
And his guys turned back and chickened out and all that.
They're mirroring.
Yeah, they're very, they're very much mirroring.
There isn't really any big difference between them, so to speak.
You know, the symbols.
You know, that couldn't even show up in the cave.
What the fuck do those really mean?
You know, why are we hanging on to those?
We're not really very different.
They start like.
They start a real conversation.
Maybe we should.
Maybe we shouldn't be opponents.
Yeah.
So they divide, they put together a scheme.
Each one.
Is going to cut.
A little piece of scalp.
A braid like.
Off the other guy.
And take it home.
And tell the story about the, how they, you know.
Went.
You know, even though everybody abandoned, they went there and they
fought the enemy and all that shit.
And.
And then they were going to, they knew that.
People would question.
Because they're each missing a breed too.
Right?
Of course.
So they devised a plan to bring their people back to meet at the
certain spot under the auspices that they were going to prove.
They're going to show them the dead body of the enemy.
You know.
And they went and actualized this.
And brought their people back and visit.
There's a whole long story.
About the kind of interaction that happened there.
But suffice to say they ended up.
The two guys owl child and the.
And the.
And the snake man.
They traded lives.
They traded lodges.
They traded wives.
They traded everything.
And so.
And so.
Like they just entered into each other's tribe.
And took on that person's identity.
And then they encouraged people to.
Camp together for a little while at the end of that summer.
And make relationships, which they did.
Everybody was getting along.
Many long-term relationships were made.
Hold on.
I gotta call my dogs.
Oh.
Jenny's the Dalmatian.
She ate.
And then wanted to go out. That's good.
She's been going out, but she hadn't eaten yet.
She'd been too stressed.
Oh, Jenny.
Let's go in.
Let's go.
So a lot of good relationships were made.
And at the end of the season, kind of, when the sea,
like they had this, like you can't campus one big camp for very
long, you know, that's very harvest time.
Right.
Only when there's enough resources to feed everybody.
Yeah.
Right.
So as, as winters approach, and you got to break up in the
smaller, smaller camps, and it sucks for everybody because they
like to be together, you know.
So, so the people in this new camp were kind of grieving that
they had to leave each other.
The teenagers were especially having difficulty dealing with
the younger people.
Having difficulty dealing with the separation.
And so while everybody was already starting to move out,
