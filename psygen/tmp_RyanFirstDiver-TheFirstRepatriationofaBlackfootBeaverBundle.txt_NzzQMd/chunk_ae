they kind of lingered on and played some more games together.
And one of the games that they played was a hoop and arrow
game.
Where you throw this, this ring is dividing into different
segments and stuff.
And then you try to pass a dart through an arrow through it,
you know, and depending on what part of the hoop you hit,
you get different points and that kind of thing.
At the end of the game, two boys seemed to be tied,
but they disagreed that they were tied.
They each thought they actually beat the other and they start
arguing about it.
And in the end, the big gunny boy picked up a weapon,
I think a stick, something simple,
and killed that snake boy, the younger guy.
And that rekindled the whole feud that they had supposedly
overcome.
And, you know, so for me, like, there's, you know,
and this is what, like we have, we have a dance in the beaver
bundle that has that ring that they played with.
And the scalp.
And it involves the links, which is the embodiment of Morningstar.
The links dances that scalp around the hoop and stick.
And, but the song.
The song that goes with it is a, is a song about, you know,
the, it's a, it's now used as a victory song.
But it's a, it's a song that says, you know, the snake man,
he cried anyway.
And it's, it's a weird thing, like I get from this story, like,
there's very court, like, you know, basic anthropological stuff
that I get from this story, you know, like we are, we are all
human.
We are all, like, basically the same in all of our motivations
and the ways that we carry out things and all of this weird,
we're, you know, at core, we're all the same.
Imagine that these symbols divide us like the visual thing.
First of all, and if we can take out that element,
and all, you know, if we can take out that element, we can get
much closer, but then the next divisory issue is distance.
It reminds me of the divisions in the hoop about saying it's
important.
Also.
We got about very well,
we got about one minute and then I have to record again.
okay can you hold your thought here well this is this basically the end of this
story that's the owl child story and that's what the owl child scalp in the
bundle yes yeah well no his enemies scalp well he's a snake
snake-boy scalp the snake-boy scalp with the with the hoop sometimes also with
the with the dart but what does it mean the snake boy cried anyway the snake
boy died this yeah yeah well he cried anyway the snake the snake man because
he when he was being killed you like in the Q games the point systems if you're
getting killed and you cry you know that's not good okay we have to stop
there hold that thought I'll be back okay all right we're back okay I want to go
back to your question what did the humans contribute to the bundle and what
was the agreement what were the agreements also yeah that's that's where
I wanted to go okay because I recognize yeah I was thinking in terms of that the
tangible bundle which would be the scalps like the humans the humans robe is in
there too in in essence but but yeah the agreement in like what happened was
there wasn't gonna be an agreement like the the the animals had stolen this this
human's wife this human what's so happy the white grass was his name which is
still a family name here they had stolen it the animals had stolen his wife the
beavers in particular charmed her taking her away and he was left with a with a
with the infant son who had no way to feed and he in turn stole the beavers
favorite grandchild young pup albino pup special pup and was holding it in
ransom and there was some negotiations that took place but ultimately then the
beavers called on all of their like all the animals that rely on them which are a
lot of different animals in one way or another they're connected with the beaver
with the beavers and so they called on all of their friends to come and
participate and they brought their bundle and the guy's wife back and they're
and transferred him their bundle which was seven predators that were dangerous
to beavers bears wolves eagles there's seven of them now there's seven of them
in that original bundle and and because Matoya be he had he had had these like they
weren't dreams he cried he cried himself to sleep every night without his wife that
his young wife and then this old man was coming to see him he didn't know where
the old man came from spirit spirit being was coming to see him and tell him
um the old man was telling me your wife isn't dead this is what's happened you know she got
too lonely because he was he was a ridiculously skilled trapper but it required that he spent
all his time with nature and he was he was not spending the time with his with his girl
and he wouldn't let her bring her sister she was like can I bring my sister over to the camp
because she could keep me company no no too many people up here spook the animals
gotta keep a low profile you know can I go like stay with my parents and stuff while you're up
here visit with my parents and they're in their clan hey I want you here with me what you hear
with me and so she got you know bored and lonely and the beavers noticed this and then there was
a be a bachelor beaver that kind of like transformed himself to look like a like a handsome young
man charmed her to go with him and eventually led led her what's up what's up jenny you want to go out
I think they think there's something outside all the dogs are barking it's okay it's okay you guys
no there's nothing out there look I'll look out the door I'm looking out there's nobody
just a snowy neighborhood
all right go to bed you guys chill up
so
there wasn't going to be a much of a negotiation because
um like they brought this bundle to him that they consider very sacred and they brought his wife
back and they were like all we want is our pup and he and he refused and he refused based on what
this old man the spirit man had been telling him hey um he held on to that pup
and then this emmoni see
the otter addressed the other animals and said
but the nerve of this human being
they only just arrived here
and he's making like your most sacred bundle is not enough for him
you know look at the sky and this is where this is where right right came into the story
it was through the otter the otter was ready to dance and he is like look at you know look at
this character sitting here he's soft he's slow he's weak can't fly can't run worth a damn
can't fend for himself
why don't we just yeah why don't we just all gang up on him and eat him be done with it
you know and this is this is when the the elder beaver
kind of stepped in because the animals were considering it
oh it was it was an obvious solution you know he wasn't accepting their offer
it was a good offer fuck this guy you know and who is this guy like he's got you know nothing
so um but the elder beaver said okay yeah we can like it'd be easy to kill this guy
you're right he's nothing like as far as like a physical challenge now it's nothing
we'll kill this guy like a heartbeat but um
the other humans are gonna learn about this
there's a lot of other humans they're gonna learn about this
because when you do something like that you can't keep it secret it's gonna come out no
so
we could go that route
and be done with this tonight right right here right now
um but that's not really what I called you here for
like I need you guys's help I think rather than establishing that as our future
in relation to these humans these people um we should maybe help them
compensate
for some of their shortcomings you know they're not really adapted to live here we've been living
here a long time give them some of our knowledge about how to live here and live here well in
relation to each other how to like all the all the core stuff how to live here it's a way of life
in this place and if we teach them that then in turn they will have respect for us
and they won't just kill us because they're afraid when they see us
they'll kill us some of us to eat us
but they'll have respect for us we've lived here a lot longer all of our
all of our you know the things that we've learned
you know estomato we've embodied it
they haven't embodied any they're born and they don't have any that instinct stuff
so we will give we'll share with them some of what we have and they practice that in the future
they'll have that
and and and live respectfully so that was what the humans ultimately signed up well that was what
the animals ultimately signed on for
you know
you don't really get a sense of whether he was a philosopher or not
or a politician or anything he was a trapper right but he was he was told by this old man in
these in in these encounters not to give that pup up not to agree to the to the whole thing until
until it was a sign that he would recognize
that it was okay to do that hey and that did come at the end because all the animals gave things
gave their robes gave their songs and then the old beavers you know again he's like okay
like look at this this giant this giant bundle and we've given you so much of our knowledge and
stuff right all i want is my pup and and
what do you hope he didn't feel like he'd seen what he needed to see
like whatever was supposed to be his cute so there's still there's still people here who haven't given
anything and there was there was these two people like each one beside the door
two like everybody that came to that transform themselves to look human-esque like that's part
of the story too if you really tell the story in a good blackfoot way you describe it describe
you know the different animal beings that came in there but they tried to make themselves look
human-esque and they were grotesque they freaked out matoyapi so much he couldn't he couldn't
hardly bear to look at them because they were so like frightening you know
and there was these two they were they were on either side of the lodge door
or that had these robes pulled up over their heads like buffalo robes
and um those two haven't i don't know what's going on there you know they haven't given anything to
the bundle and who are they and then they they pulled back their their robes and the and the one
was that old man that had been coming to him in the night and then the other one was an old woman
and they started singing their songs to give to the bundle and when they started singing their songs
then it became immediately apparent that this is the sun and the moon yeah and they they gave a
lot of songs and then when they were done go come eat some the night the night sun opened the
the lodge door and called in this boy who brought in these two animals that nobody had ever seen
one of them was black and one of them was white the male was black the female was white
and he he led these two animals in and he and he said that this is uh you know he he started singing
songs and this was um the morning star of course and
and what he gave to the bundle were the dogs
um
the lynx tail is also like the actual person who embodies the morning star in the ceremony
wears the lynx tail um but he brought the he brought domesticated dogs
dogs nobody'd ever known them before and he said this this this uh black dog this male dog
will haul your bundle when you move from camp to camp you make a travois and he'll carry your bundle
this female dog is going to make more dogs and you're going to give these dogs to the humans
these dogs are going to protect all the humans they're going to look out for you whenever
any dangers approaching they're going to alert you they're going to get between you and the danger
and that's that's what he gave and that was when matoya api
said that he had got what was needed and uh he agreed to the to the treaty
and he would share with the humans what they'd you know what had gone on and he would change
his name from matoya api to natocianipi the sun came down brings brings down the sun
basically yeah natocianipi which became another famous name for beaver men
um now
alan my my my elders um grandfather was one of the what was the last that i know
natocianipi the last brings down the sun but he won't be the last there'll be there'll be others
yeah
so that's what the humans gave to the bundle
that's that's kind of like that's uh that's more than i expected to talk about what a bundle is
but you have any questions i was talking about harvard i was trying to tell a harvard story
i know we're gonna get back to mad but um
the human gave
the the beaver pup back the human gave the beaver pup back the human gave
um the human gave uh
uh
like in natocianipi like mutual respect uh
like before this is a guy who his whole operation his whole life had been
and i'm finding the fanciest looking animals killing them preparing their skins and you
know selling it to people trading it bartering it and stuff like all he was was a it was a
was a killing machine and very inserted into the natural world and it wasn't you know for food
it was just for things like robes and stuff you know
just for getting the fanciest you know the albinos and the mixed color patterns and
different animals and things you know um that's what he was known for he he was the trapper
extraordinaire that was the original beaver man
and he gave the pup and he gave respect what about the contributions of the sun and moon
