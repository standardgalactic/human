these are not his contributions no those come in on this those were those were things he was
waiting for he was right those came in on the side of what the animals would offer to him right
okay so the pup and mutual respect
which isn't minor not trivial anything else
no that's basically that's basically it the mutual respect is the big thing the pup
is just a symbol just like his just like his son who is not able to to feed without his mom
keeping the beaver pup from his parents is is endangering the future generations yeah this is
what we're talking about yes yes they're just symbols future generations and yes yes yes the
children yeah so in order to save the children the future generations we must agree to have a
mutual respect where we can coexist yes us with the animals and that the the mainstream culture
today does not have that hey no it's more than that though too unless i don't understand something
or i'm making something out can i go on a tangent yes a little one
i work with rattlesnakes uh that's a that's a that's probably a
out of my income my annual income probably a tenth of it comes from wrangling rattlesnakes
in the heart of blackfoot territory in lethbridge where i live this is like this is like the the
nexus of this is you know this is the heart of blackfoot territory and there's a huge rattlesnake
population pray rattlesnakes and i'm the guy uh that gets called when a rattlesnake shows up
at in somebody's yard and the human being
needs something to be done about it uh you know like you're you're not allowed here
to kill snakes it's against the law i know in the states you're still allowed to kill snakes
almost everywhere yeah here here in alberta where i live um you are not allowed to kill any of our
natural snake species you will get up to a 30 000 fine in five years in prison
wow it's it's a it's a criminal offense um
so given that you're not allowed to kill a snake if you can't just coexist with one
real easy then you end up calling the rattlesnake guy and that's me i took on that position
because i've been around snakes all my life but also because of the beaver bundle because i
thought this was a way to kind of honor my role as a beaver man and the rattlesnakes this is why
i want to go on this tangent the rattlesnakes i find are the best symbol in my mind of that treaty
that was made yes yes i know where you're going and please keep going there with the beaver bundle
yes with white grass yes why are they the best symbol because there are venomous snakes all over
the earth but only here in the americas do you find this thing called a rattlesnake
and a rattlesnake co-evolved with human presence here it's a it's not a it's not an old old thing
having having rattles on a snake it's something that co-evolved with humans and
i think you know if it was a situation where cultures demonized so to speak the the snakes
like the main even so to speak just straight up demonize them well yeah well obviously christian
culture does but there's other there's others cultures that just are snake haters but don't
necessarily demonize them they're just like because they don't have rattlesnakes they have
these other snakes to just fight them with no warning right we have rattlesnakes why do we
have rattlesnakes because we agreed to coexist with the animals in all of the animals including
the rattlesnakes there's no way that rattle evolves in a cultural situation with humans
they're going to respond negatively to that rattle and just kill the snake
when they're warned that rattle only evolves if it has the effect that it needs to have which is to
say leave me alone and people you know back off um that doesn't happen everywhere else in the world
because everywhere else in the world they don't have this agreement maybe you know yeah so let me
rephrase what you said and now um you know we've had hundreds of years now of of a of a different
cultural influence here in the americas and we are starting to see pockets of rattlesnakes
that are changing um there's a mojave mojave rattlesnake uh where a lot of the young snakes
are being born with a with a crooked tail that can't rattle uh and there's um there are prairie
rattlesnakes the same species that are here in blackfoot territory uh just a couple provinces
east of here in manitoba there's a pocket of prairie rattlesnakes where the newborns are
being born without a nub to form a rattle on and herpetologists do believe that this is because
the persecution of the rattlesnake you know the the snake in general yeah um and that you know
now having the rattle is evolutionarily or natural selection wise not a good thing here
because of the cultural system of the humans in other words the so the rattle where it doesn't
warn the humans off successfully goes away
yeah i mean if the if the rattle goes off and and kill the snake oh there's a snake there kill it
right yeah then then the rattle goes away yeah over time yeah over time that's the way natural
selection works right like blackfoot knowledge is very aligned with with some of the core
mainstream science and ecology knowledge too and natural selection is not it you know
it's it all it all plays in there like um i think that's why we have the rattlesnakes here
is because natural selection playing into a eco social uh situation a context
where there's an agreement we're not just going to kill something just because it's here
you know just because it shows up there is there there are blacks of protocols around um like if a
bird enters into your house a flies in on its own kind of thing um people would kill it
and i think that's just because of the you know the situation with
if you live in a teepee which is always open it's never never entirely closed
and you start and you and you and you give grant
to any birds to come in you're you're gonna have a problem same with anything like if you
you know like there is a beaver beaver story about a mouse
that started taking up residence in this guy's bundle and he had a conflict like i'm not supposed
to have a problem with the animals right but here's this mouse dug into the side of my bundle
what do i do and he ultimately decided to let the mouse live there and the mouse would go and
raid other people's um tobacco stores in the night and bring them back to his bundle
and so it turned out being a good thing there's some songs associated with the mouse um
but you know i myself experimented as a beaver man letting mice come into my modern house
it's not a good idea they might not bring you tobacco no and i i think in the past letting
birds into your teepee was not a good idea you know yeah but but other than that kind of a thing
that little space that's a controlled space right the little the little uh yeah other than that little
space um we're not allowed to kill things other than for food you know yes yeah or you know
like there's plants that are used for different things and stuff of course
but you know you have to have a good reason to be taken out some life not just because you're afraid
of it or just because it's a ice or or whatever you know like what we do today yeah yeah
so i'm gonna recap this and then we're gonna start again okay uh
the rattlesnakes are a good example of the agreement because they are an excellent example
of the agreement because they have rattles right and so they could if they don't have rattles
just simply wait till you get close enough to them maybe you don't notice them maybe you're
afraid of them whatever then just bite you but because they have rattles they alert you
and they ask they've got another step like all of the venomous snakes they're very first
um self-defense is camouflage yes so they will just sit very still and hope that you just pass by
right but if that doesn't work and you don't just pass by and you're gonna injure them
threaten them if you come i mean you have to come within four or five inches of a snake to get bit
in reality yeah so if you if you come that close to it that means his life is threatened
and it's gonna bite you now rattlesnake has one more step in in mitigating that
um conflict that you don't find anywhere else you find it in north america
because i think this is the agreement in north america that we're not just going to kill each
other for being there and in under that circumstance the rattle can evolve
if you don't have that circumstance then all it does is alert the human before it gets bit
to the snakes presence and the human hates the snake and kills the snake yes
all right let me try to recap this one more time so
the the rattlesnake is an example of the agreement it gives you the chance
to remember to respect the animal because it warns you thoughtably warns you right in a way
that everything recognizes this sound very distinctive sound
and so where that treaty has been well kept where that agreement has been kept the rattlesnakes keep
their rattles in some places where that agreement is not kept by the humans the rattlesnakes begin
to lose their rattles that's right now there's no more warning and the first thing camouflage
turns out to be very problematic for the human because the human will die yeah the human can't
see them right blind essentially yeah all right hold that thought one more session
i'll be back okay yep sounds good
so we're returning from part four we've just been talking about the rattlesnakes we're
returning four part two part four um i just want to mention something that occurred to me
it's almost as if there's an intergenerational transfer between the rattlesnakes and they transfer
the rattle to their children but then if the agreement is broken that transfer doesn't
stop happening this is just in my mind something happens with the body because i mean like i mean
maybe it maybe it's just like if i just follow in natural selection um is there's just always a
a variety of bodies and you may or may not be born without the little nub to make your rattle work
or you know your tail might be angled i mean what they're what they're seeing now in those two
populations the mojave and the manitoba prairie rattlesnake are um what they would now consider
mutations of course yes yeah that are all right you know all right so do we here return to madge
in harvard yeah okay yeah so madge walters oh she had a photo of her i've never seen her
i would like to see her um in my stories earlier i mentioned marlene walters i think who's who was
on the blackfeet tribal business council who i was working with with the land consolidation act
i know sometimes people get like when that the when that the council you're working with no no
madge walters is a different walters than the marlene there is a family of people on the
blackfeet reservation named walters that are not related to her um i don't know where they
got the walter name but it wasn't it wasn't through madge madge was in san francisco
she's very wealthy um or at least in blackfeet terms she was because because she she was able
to use those three young people to buy a lot of things and she was trying to overcome her cancer
she was fully like
interested like she she didn't want just the bundles she wanted the story she wanted as much as she
could understand she was trying to use these things to help herself wow um and she died
but when she died she had a the considerable collection of blackfoot
bundles and other individual sacred items and stuff um a whole like i mean i've i had a big a thick
a thick pile of um correspondence between her and the three young people out here
that would i'm looking at a letter from her yeah in which the final paragraph is she's asking
someone about artifacts or they're asking her and the final paragraph is i do not wonder that you
feel you cannot pay six hundred dollars for the blood bundle i've never yet seen one that i think
would be worth that amount six hundred dollars my goodness dude that's ridiculous okay to put
that in perspective when i transferred into to be a beaver man i was poor
and i still uh i took a whole year my wife and i well about eight months
and everything we could get we put away
um and we bought things and we put away money and we bought things to give away to the people
that would come to our transfer and our family members came forward well i should say hers not mine
um my wife's uncle came forward and gave like you know gave me like a thousand bucks
we should bear in mind though that um in 1947 that's approximately equivalent to
eight thousand dollars today okay i think i paid about equivalent to about 40 to 50
thousand today i paid enough for an undergraduate education to get the beaver bundle transferred
to me okay um and that's what people normally pay to enter into like one of the bigger bundles
or sacred societies here sometimes like it's not it's not always like it's not all at once
like i like we probably put 20 000 into our original transfer
um but then we were hosting the ceremonies in waterton park we had to buy up a you know
two thousand dollar tp we had to haul everything out there to do our ceremonies feed everybody
like like in the in the in the time that um
that i was running those ceremonies i definitely spent 40 to 50 thousand dollars
on on ceremony stuff with with our bundle to do you know and that's all the training
like when you have the bundle that's your training time
when you get rid of when you transfer it on then there's kind of a relaxed period most times for
for beaver bundles there's no relax like the other bundles in the system usually we have them
maybe three four years transfer them another caretea carekeeper and you get a break
while that next carekeepers taking care of them and the one after that will come approach you as
as an elder to teach them and then you have to get back into actual working with it and that kind
of thing and and as an elder i mean even though you're making like it's oh it's all this stuff is
sacrifice stuff and you're so you're sacrificing a lot and that's because you know you're learning
a lot and you're getting a lot of social um
cachet with it as well you know um but it's a huge responsibility to be the keeper of a living library
yeah huge i like it it's in me yes you know that's a that's a thing like it's not written down
yes you know it's in me yes i you know you become the living library yes yes and you and you pay for
that um but that's why i mean it makes you a resource it's it's an investment in a way you know
because because you do you do like like that's how the elders are ultimately like taking care of
you know
they don't got work their whole lives because they got like this isn't the western system there's no
fucking there's no fucking retirement yeah yeah and so
it provides a way for the elders to be taken care of
because they have this role and the role is not merely valuable monetarily there's reverence
for the role oh yeah yeah so harvard and match okay so match she died she died with a considerable
blackfoot collection
all of which her daughter sold to the denver art museum
now the denver art museum comes in possession i mean they they paid i don't know what they paid for it
it's probably i probably got the paperwork on it my home he does anyway my wife max wife um
my home he has the paperwork for it in our in our records what what the denver art museum paid
for it because i have all that shit i got everything um
but basically they they museums
with the the try to create ethnographic collections are basically
um most most of the or at least at that time today's a weird thing because museums are just
trying to salvage themselves and this isn't this it's not going to happen but um
in those times
when when when mad walter passed on this would have been like probably the 1950s
i think if i remember correct um
the museums were still like
if they if they had ethnographic collections they wanted a good representation of each culture
what they got from mad walters was five representations of blackfoot culture
um because they had five or more of everything oh my gosh she had so much stuff dude
and so denver art museum started selling it and trading they were like okay we got a blackfoot
beaver bundle thunder pipe horns pipe bundle moto peak society bundle uh so this masonian
we're looking at you got a uh a klamath this and a kalapuya that and you know that we don't have
you know to make our more our collection more complete let's do a trade
so mad walters collection went all over the fucking place to all the major museums
denver art museum kept a core mm-hmm their little Noah's ark of blackfoot culture
and then everything they didn't need it as second version of they sent everywhere else
yeah yeah so the the the beaver bundle that i found in the pee body museum in harvard
was one of these from mad walters uh harvard didn't have that that piece to their collection yet
