so they had got it from the mad walters collection at denver art museum
and they got it for something like 350 dollars right but magic all that got it for i think 50
sure yeah
and you can see here
a kind of a terrifying trend that's just going to continue where the indigenous people are so poor
that they're selling their sacred history to the colonials for a pittance well that was happened
that's not anymore yes and i have to kind of explain this too because when i say it's like 1950
the united states that that 1940s and 1950s when mad walters came up here was 1940 early
1940s and and she kept collecting into the 1950s and then she died and then it went to denver art
museum and then from there it dispersed everywhere else now when i'm talking about the 1940s and 50s
in canada it's a different situation than in the united states with indians and stuff all right
in the united states in 1924 there was something called the indian reorganization act
a national policy that that went through that drew an end to the era supposedly of forced
assimilation that said you can keep your culture now we want diversity here in the united states
um you can keep your culture we're gonna we're gonna remove the residential schools
from your reserves we are going to remove the federal indian agents from your reserves
we are going to let you make your own band councils to control your communities we are
going to let you control your own schools and all that stuff and you can leave your reserve
and participate in the national economy if you want and in fact we will offer you incentive
and move you uh with you know we'll we'll help you get established in either san francisco
or chicago my my grandma went to chicago uh um but this was in 1924 in the united states
the same kind of federal legislation did not happen here in canada until 1968
so 1970s was the big time of change here 1960s 70s where like uh the language was lost
um i mean that happened in the 20s 30s in the states with most of the tribes through the indian
reorganization act again it's the economic incentive or uh the economic incentive you can
come off reserve and make some money yeah if you want to come live in the city yeah come
live in the city and you gotta learn english you got that happened in the 20s there it happened
in the 60s here so it's a different timeline yeah so so when swindsunder brought madge from
montana into albert he is bringing her into a world that was three four decades late
from what she's used to i see yeah
i mean for her it's a treasure trove but it's a terrifying situation yeah for the business people
yeah a lot a lot of shit was lost to her and these young and these young guys
they don't even know what they're selling no and they didn't give a fuck right they just wanted
some whiskey or whatever you know i'm guessing well those guys they were just trying to get
but like if you if you watch like a really good if you if you want to look at some um go to the
go to the um um what is it the fucking uh canadian film board website and watch
circle of the sun and then standing alone and then the last roundup and these are three different
films um bio documentaries on the late pete standing alone who made the first film circle of the sun
when he was about 25 and then the second film um standing alone when he was about 50
and then the last roundup when he's about 75 and you'll see when he's 25 years old
he thinks the sun dances he thinks all the all the ceremony stuff is just for the old people
he doesn't think it's for him yeah he thinks it's for the old people and he thinks it's going away
and the and the whole documentary is about how it's going away like oh this is this is this
gone right this this is the last of this fucking thing the whole way of life is going away
supposedly yeah 25 years later he's becoming the elder nice or he's in the society
he's in the he's in the core of the society's 25 years later and stuff he's living it his parents
have died and ricocheted him into a situation where he suddenly respects what this tradition has to
offer his parents died on the highway and you know 25 years after that he's he's the elder elder
of the horns like he's one of the top two elders and they do if they do the third film
Narciss did that film um but and then I interviewed him at the uh we had a private screening of the
last roundup his third film at redcore college uh with the with the with the guys from um the
Canadian film board and they they asked that just like three or four of us to to give him questions
and I asked him because he was eight years old at the time and and he was really
in good physical standing you know um like like he was still like like his mind was all there
his body was still you know pretty good like he wasn't like he was standing straight and walking
good and he was healthy and skinny and all that shit so I told him um Pete my question what's
your secret you know you're 80 years old looks so good
girl still like you what's up how'd you get that way he said there's three secrets
so first of all you know you're you're only human and every once in a while
you got to let yourself indulge
he was talking specifically about beer
you know nothing at the door I just standing up um he's like you can get it you can buy a case of beer
once a week and get hammered get really drunk and enjoy yourself
and there's nothing wrong with that but you don't do it every day
what's the number two
you got to change wives every
you know five six years
he had he had changed wives several times in his lifetime and he kind of jokingly said
I've been with Betty now more than 10 years I think this is the end
it was but um number three
um stick with the young people
don't worry about the old people they're going out
forget about those guys stick with the young people
um and that was something that I know was not bullshit at all
that he learned from his horses because he'd expressed it to me in other ways many times
but he's basically like if I want to if I want to work on something new I don't work with my old
horses ah you know I raised the young horses into it ah yes yeah
all right so we were going on a journey to learn something about Harvard
well we learned about we learned about Madge Walters a little bit yeah yeah
Harvard that I want to get back to that's the core story so the beaver bundle that was on the
accessions list that I received when I went to Harvard the first time
after they kind of like gave me that they tried to shake me off
right so you're going to have to book months in advance and this kind of thing they do research blah
blah and I'd call their bluff and I'm like okay come down and then they showed me the list that they
had of the what they had in their uh collections that were blackfoot and a beaver bundle was high
upon the list like second second to human remains which they thought we would go after
that's not blackfoot protocol like we don't we just deal with living the bundles we consider still be
living not the not the dead yes so I went straight after the bundle um that day looking at the
accessions records taking my notes all that stuff and then I went through all their other
shit and I looked at all everything that they had that day I just spent the whole day going
through their accessions records on everything they had figured out how they got it where they got
it how much they paid what they did you know how everything that you know that I could from
everything that they had I had at that point so I went home with that information I was going to
enter it into my database that I'm given to the tribe and that night I got a call from George
what's his last name horse capture
he's not black
where is he from
I remember
it's from another tribe in Montana
I want to say he's grovant but I'm not sure
George horse capture this is the Smithsonian's Indian
and George calls me and says who the fuck are you basically not in not in too much of
a different tone than that you know like hey we got a letter from you at the Smithsonian
and I see you've got you know
I see you've got real old persons permission and all of this but I don't know who you are
I don't know what you think you're doing I think you're probably disempowering
the blackfoot community doing what you're doing I don't think I'm going to send you any of the
Smithsonian's data I think you can fuck off this is basically George horse captures message to me
so I went over to my to my advisor at the University of Massachusetts and told him you
know I got this weird phone call from George horse capture this is what he said to me I get it you
know he's like yeah I get it too
what do I do about it sour no just leave it for now I guess I'm not getting Smithsonian stuff
or whatever right so it's kind of left it a couple days later I get another phone call
and this is from Joyce Boone Hunter so Joyce Boone Hunter uh is the first cousin of Marlene
Bear Walters who was the tribal council member who I was working most closely with
on the Blackfeet tribal business council previously so this is our first cousin
and Joyce calls me Joyce is the the person on the federal register for the Native American Graves
Protection and Repatriation Act and that act just happened to come out like that year it's 1995
that act was I mean I guess it was written in 1990 but it was only signed by George Bush in 1995
and I didn't even know shit about it
I mean I kind of understood about repatriation stuff a little bit from the literature my my mentor
had shown me but I didn't know about NAGPRA the Native American Graves Protection Repatriation Act
I didn't know about repatriations with museums all I thought was that I was putting together a guide
of where the shit was in the world so that people could find stuff to look at to learn
hmm you know yeah and so Joyce calls me up and she's like she's the person who's listed on the
federal register and she was trained by George Horse Capture at the Smithsonian
the guy who had called me a few days earlier and so she calls me up and she's she's upset she's mad
she's like I don't know what you what you think you're doing but like you're doing my job
I'm the I'm the person on the federal register for repatriation I'm supposed to be collecting
the inventories for our tribe and I'm hearing from all these museums that they're getting
this inquiry from you who who are you what's going on so I told her hey you know I was on the
phone with her but hey man I'm not trying to step on any of these feet or anything I was working
with Earl and Marlene and just trying to trying to pull in inventories from these museums I don't
know anything about this dag press stuff but let me tell you something like within walking distance
from me there's a beaver bundle at Harvard's Museum I just was in their accessions the other day
I'll send you all my information about it but they have a beaver bundle right here
and she did a whole 180 on me like in a heartbeat and was like do you think you could go over there
and start negotiating to bring it home and I was like yep I think that's yeah totally right so
um so Joyce uh spoon hunter
invited me into repatriation she was the lead for the Blackfeet Nation on repatriation
she's listed on she's the only person listed on the federal register for it
and she's the one that said right can you go negotiate this so I did I contacted Harvard I said
I'm interested in um coming to have a meeting about talking about bringing that beaver bundle
out of the museum back to the community I'm representing the community and um
um and they said well we have this new uh repatriation liaison
called Emery Victor Scout Emery Victor how sorry Emery Victor how and um she'll help you
so Emery gets in contact with me to schedule a meeting and she is very very French
like overwhelmingly French accent
and I don't know dude I was probably
23 24 my goodness dealing with dealing with a middle aged
you know French academic working at Harvard
and um I know what the fuck to do so I bought two bottles of wine
from the from the Willamette Valley where I grew up in Oregon
really good wine ah really good shit and when I went to Harvard to meet with Emery
I brought this wine uh as a gift and she was like Ryan
do you buy me this wine because I am French
no are you French I didn't even know
um somehow or another I won Emery's heart I think I don't know I feel like it was kind
of through the wine thing but that was just a gateway I think I would have won her anyway
I won her heart like really won her heart like like she was in love with me
um she was married you know but she loved me and right away she was like she was like okay
we have to be very careful you know this means that they're going they're going to try to stop
this repatriation you know like she started fucking coaching me dude
this is where they're gonna this is the angle in the law that they're gonna use against you
you have to make sure you craft your argument against this and against this and she fucking
taught me how to craft a repatriation uh claim to beat Harvard wow and it was it was beautiful
yeah and you know and they had to go through with it um
yeah I mean this is where you know Harvard School of Law is it didn't put her in good
terms with the museum of course yeah not surprising they didn't they and they didn't
know the full extent of like how she'd helped me either you know right um they just thought
she was the go-between but she she was really like I would give her okay this draft and
she'd be like oh look out for that sentence they're gonna pick that apart you know and she
really she really coached me to help me so where I could fight every other museum after that
without a problem you know yeah there was a transfer there there was right she transferred
you the power to fight museums in a way she did yeah yeah yeah can you hold that thought
yep okay I'll be back as soon as the processing is done
so this is actually part six and we talked about her helping you understand how to argue against
Harvard the museum she works for yeah to succeed in repatriating Blackfoot traditional longings
yeah yeah so that was that was Emery Victor how she she helped she helped me out to make sure
I had a successful successfully written claim um
the only person who can sign off on that of course is Joyce Spoonhunter on the federal register
so Harvard wanted um Joyce intended to send a group of elders out here to pick up the bundle
but Harvard wanted her to come physically
view it and sign off
and okay something about coming back to the the categorization of things we we've mentioned
something earlier um in Harvard in in the in the Peabody Museum the Peabody Museum was you know
not originally like a cultural museum I think it was originally a paleontological museum actually
but it was it was much more a natural history museum
than it was a cultural museum to begin with at Harvard and uh all of the beaver bundle
had been parsed out throughout the storage areas to conform with categories
you know it's like dissecting your father and putting different pieces in different boxes
based on which function you think the piece had or some ridiculous even worse thing
yeah so so you know beaver pelts go over here in their museum storage
goose loon pelts or whatever go over here um artifacts
human made things go over here and and they're separated into all of these different categories
um so the beaver bundle was spread all over the museum all over the museum
was there a central index of what the beaver bundle originally contained that you could work from
yeah okay yeah there was there was a there was an original inventory
um and for the most part they had all of the things all of the items of the bundle
what was what was really missing was this uh a bag um they call them
