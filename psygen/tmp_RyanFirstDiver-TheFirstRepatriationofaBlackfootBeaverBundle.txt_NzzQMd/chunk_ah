corn husk bags now but that's just a colonial era thing there's a type of a basketry bag
almost like a purse that was made on the on unlike just just over the mountains from here
Salish Kootenai those you know those areas
um it those bags were very complicated to make
wasn't like I mean normal Native American basketry itself is very complex and and um
um like god there's not even a market that that that really pays what it's worth in the world
you know for for for the kind of artistry that goes into normal basketry but these bags are especially
like even the skilled artisan is going to take them a long long time to make these bags
um they are tightly woven hemp bags with with designs and you know with uh with
dyed designs on them and and and such um
the corn husk bags they're called today um
but there was an old like in the beaver bundles the corn husk bags
it was a trade item and obviously like a super luxurious one
and it's used to hold your your seven rattles
it's a rattle bag in the beaver bundle and so this bundle came to Harvard with one of those bags
but Harvard could not find the bag
and then they let me through the storage with Anne Marie and we could not find the bag
so we think the bag's gone from the museum a lot of things have disappeared in the years from
sure and um we think that's gone and so we get the we get the rest of it all together
in a in a room and stuff and Joyce is gonna Joyce is they want Joyce to come and identify it
make sure that's the beaver bundle sign off on it she has to physically see it no bullshit yeah
but the tribe won't send her
black black feet nation at the time was just not gonna invest send her out there for it
meaning they won't pay for it they won't pay for her to get a plane ticket in the hotel to come out
and do what she needs to do to bring that bundle home oh my gosh she's the only person on the
federal register who can do it only the single only person and they they won't fly her out there to do it
wow so i so i fly her out there and she stays at my apartment
hmm
and we go into a meeting with the director of the museum whose name i don't even remember
as well as Anne Marie Victor how i know her first name Barbara i know that because every
she's the bitch at me all the time about Barbara
so i remember her that's why i think i remember susan too but
Barbara meets us in this fancy room at a long table and there's art
paintings of all of these like Harvard presidents or something right around the room
and me and Joyce are there sitting across the long table from Anne Marie Victor how and Barbara
Barbara and Barbara says you have to appreciate this is Harvard she was she was British i don't
know her good British accent but in her British accent see she said you have to appreciate this
is Harvard University that was her opening line and Joyce retorted with not a fucking delay
you need to appreciate i'm from the Blackfeet Nation and our men are ready to come over here on
horseback and take this fucking bundle back you know she didn't say fucking right she said we're
gonna come over here and take it we don't care about her nothing means nothing to us yeah
and um that's where we started that day
wow but we just had a duty to do like the process in argument like the legal argument i had already
sealed it dude i'd already sealed it it just had to be signed off i made it happen i fucking
brought her there and and housed her and wrote her to the museum wrote her the airport and got
her off back home and all that shit to sign off on that beaver bundle
but a but a month later a group of elders showed up in Boston
and i thought that they would know what they were there for
nope
this group that showed up they were on a tour there's this was a this was a group of elders
from all four of the different Blackfeet tribes so it included Carol Murray from
from um Scoppy Picani the southern Blackfoot in Montana um and Tom Blackweasel
from um Scoppy Picani in Montana it included Alan Pard
from Apatofici Picani in Alberta
it included Frank Weaselhead Martin Heavyhead who would who would become my father-in-law
um Narciss Blood who would become my best friend for two decades
Les Healy Annabelle Crossbeard Wolf Alvin Mountain Horse from the Bloods
do we have anyone from Sixica
i think we did all right so it was only three of the four tribes represented but they all came
in they flew in and they were on tour they were going to Chicago and then Boston and then Washington
D.C. um
or no no Boston was their last place i think they just went to Chicago and Boston that trip
yeah yeah yeah yeah i'll tell you the Washington trip because i was there actually but um
yeah they went they went to Chicago and and then the Boston and they just thought
that they were going to be touring the museum really Joyce never told them that they were
picking up a bun like i don't know what the fuck you know really myself
you know a lot of my a lot of i don't want to talk bad about Joyce but anyway it was it was weird
to me that that that i had to fly her there it was weird to me that the elders that came
there pick up the bundle didn't even know what the what the heck was going on
and then um i i went to the airport i i i like rented a van i knew they were coming
i had a whole plan hey we were gonna go pick up the bundle at the museum and then
and then i was gonna take them i knew they their plane flight wasn't for a couple of days
so i was going to take them out of the city into Connecticut to Foxwood's
to the to the Mashantucket Pequot tribe there's a big casino hotel there it's a lot of fun
and we were going to stash up there for a couple of days and then go back to their
flights and such right so i rented i rented a van like a 10 person van or something like a big van
you know and i went to the airport to pick them up and i missed them somehow they got taxis or
something they got they got to their their first hotel and so i drove over there and i talked
talked to somebody there i can't even remember who i who i've met there might have been less
healing might have been narcissus i can't remember but the gist of it was all right well
we're we're we'll we'll uh see you in the morning and come pick us up and we'll go to the museum
and uh and so and that was that was what you know was intended anyway i was just gonna try to
give my ride to their hotels and they didn't have to pay for taxi you know sure but uh anyway so in
the morning i went over there to pick them up that they were already go and got in my van and
everything and um we started going drive and i started driving over to harvard and i was telling
them um yeah we got the beaver bundle like everything stashed off in one room it's but it's
all pulled apart because i you know i told them how they've had it all over the museum you know
right and uh so you know you guys are gonna need to like put it back together and sing it out of
there you know oh and i've seen them like looking at each other like what the fuck what's going on
you know right what what they had no idea they didn't know who i was they thought i was
somebody working for harvard
they had no idea they were there to pick up a bundle it was all hitting them off guard
and but they rolled with it you know yeah i've i've known these people for the rest of my life
now you know this is this is decades later um it's it's it's great to be able to like think back on
this and think you know they were all in that predicament and they just fucking they were just
rolling with they're like yeah fuck yeah we're gonna take a bundle you know like they didn't
question nothing didn't ask a question they just you know we're going with whatever what does this
guy say okay you know so i could see them kind of like kind of like figuring out you know who's
gonna do what and shit right and alan was the only one that you know alan and frank
hey seemed to be the ones that like all the locusts were on you know all of the fucking you
know you guys are gonna really have to handle this stuff so we get to the museum and we go
into the room where all the bundle components are
and alan starts like physically putting the bundle together
and frank is like discussing things with him as he's doing it
i i don't know what the hell they're saying because they're talking in blackfoot
yeah martin calls me over to him because he's picked up this like tobacco cutting board from
the from the bundle and uh martin calls me over to me he's like what kind of wood is this
he thinks you work for the museum still no i don't know what he thinks oh yeah yeah he thinks
well all of them think i work for the museum they think you're an academic yeah yeah
i don't know right we don't know what they thought of course it's true yeah but i i don't
know what kind of wood it is either of course yeah it's it's just a it's a very martin kind of
question though you know of all of all the things to be curious about he wants to know what kind of
wood that tobacco cutting board is made of and i think narciss and anabella are looking through
my photographs because i went through the whole peabody collection before they came everything
in storage and there's some there's some really the peabody has the coolest like most indiana
jones storage of of all the museums the smithsonian has the most guarded
like to get into the smithsonians and well that's a i'll tell that when that story comes yeah
you can back to off just a little bit thanks um
um yeah the i'll tell you about how you get into smithsonian
when we get when we get to the smithsonian but harvard has the coolest secret little chambers
and shit full of like like little tiny like elf like doors that you have to climb little ladders
that to go through and you and you move through this little door and it opens up into this gigantic
fucking storage of world treasures well you know um harvard yeah sorry i can see myself in the camera
i know how i'm depicted myself okay i know it's just i just want to see your whole face because i
want to see your facial expressions there we go yeah um
so i've i've taken pictures of everything in harvard that's blackfoot that is listed as blackfoot
they may have other things too and now that that's other stories i've gone back there for other things
but um
but i took pictures of everything and there is a pipe in there and a headdress
in storage that are are very interesting to the horn society and um that pipe is what's
called a scissors pipe um it's a whole different kind of bundle that's now i don't know if we'll be
able to renew it alan could have uh um but it didn't get there there were there were components
we were looking for they had the pipe
and we could have made the other components even but
anyway um harvard had the pipe and they had this headdress and
narsus and frank were looking at my picture or narsus and uh and annabelle were looking at my
pictures and then and probably alveon that's narsus's wife and um and then they start asking
barbara if uh we could go look at those things
and so um and then they're and then in the midst of that someone brought up like where's the rattle
bag i think alan i think alan was like where's the bag you know it's on this original list
and uh they were like oh we looked for it and he's like uh if you guys are going into storage
why don't you look again so we went off on a journey a bunch of us from the group probably
half the group i know narsus was in it frank was in it alveon i think annabelle was with us
we went off to to and carol murray most important was with us
from from um scoppy pecan from the southern black
and so we went off looking in first we went into the exhibit
and they opened up the glass case so we could look at the at the women's
society headdress that they had on the exhibit oh yeah
so we took a look at it
and narsus told the museum you know this is a very important told barbara
this is in a very important um headdress from our women's society
um but because you are willing to give us the beaver bundle back
we promise we will never ask for this headdress in the future
hmm
now he did that
i subsequently learned
because it was a fugue
one of the one of the headdresses the the boys had made and sold to madge walters
there was bs yeah
looked just like the real thing yeah but you know what gave it up
no uh sign no paint around the brim anywhere like the people who would have worn it would have been
painted yeah
so they knew it was a fake yes
so that's in harvard
and no way
did you guys find the bag now yeah i'm still going on with the story
that was just the exhibit then we went to the storage we went to the storage and the first
things that the people you know were interested in was like frank being a horn society elder
and an inapska which is very much like a caesar's pipe almost like caesar's pipe is kind of in
between beaver pipes and and thunder pipes but um frank was really interesting to see
in those things and so we went up into that secret little
that little like elf door storage area the really cool area where that shit was
and um pulled those things out and
frank was telling barbara
when the the headdress was in front of him he got
really a serious look in his eye
and he is telling barbara i have the transfers for this headdress
i can put it on
and walk out of this museum and there's nothing you can do about it
and you know i think he had her he had her scared you know
like this is this is this british woman in fucking massachusetts that like
she didn't used to dealing with prairie indians at all
and uh frank was frank was putting like putting it on like he was like he was gonna like
i'm i'm i'm gonna take off with this fuck you see what see what we're gonna do call the cops
let's see what happens you know what kind of shit show this starts
all right yeah
so he threatened her and then he backed off you know played played with her a little bit and
backed off so we looked at the caesar's pipe we looked at the headdress you know they got to
they got to check them out and everything and and then um and then we went looking for the bag
we went down the down the storage area where the bag is supposed to be
and we were walking to where the bag was supposed to be we weren't in that
area yet i mean we were we were in the basketry's
stuff area where there's stuff like that but we weren't supposed to be in the stack
where that was but carol heard something singing
and stopped and opened a drawer and pulled out the bag
yeah there it was with the number and everything
wow carol murray
yeah
there were other there were other corn husk bags in there it was like we it was like
she just i don't know how she like she said she heard singing but the museum didn't even
