think to check in that area with obviously there was other corn husk bags there
categories yeah right they're the category system right yeah it was it it was a drawer with a bunch
of them and and she just kind of like went through them and there was the one with the right number
she pulled it out and it looked old as fuck like it should
yeah
no rattles though what's that no seven rattles oh the rattles were already with the bundle
oh really wow we're just missing the bag oh yeah yeah yeah um so we went back up
you know by that time the bundle was put together they just had to put the rattles in the bag
and then we sang it out of there and you know what song allen chose to sing to lead it out of
there carol carol carol carried the bundle
and she would soon become transferred to beaver bundle
and allen was not transferred to beaver bundle yet but he was transferred that bundle
that was his first beaver bundle that i took out of harvard
he became milder for the beaver bundles later and were there any bundles alive among people
um there was at that time yeah there was there was um there was two
um one of them owned by aidoff and beaverly hungry wolf
and another owned by paul raska
um basically that you know like none that were really like inside the tribe
i mean paul paul you know paul's like none of them were like oh like both of those bundles
were functional and everything that they were like once allen got going that's when the beaver
bundles started back up you know um and his teacher was a kekinom mike swingsunder who
was the same teacher for the other two for aidoff and paul too um he was really the last beaver
man you know the last survivor um he had uh he grew up with it his parents had a beaver bundle and
um when his dad died he took his dad's role
and uh taking care of it with his mom and then when his mom died people stopped coming to the
ceremony and then when people stopped coming to the ceremony he took his bundle and brought it to
the river and gave it back gave it back to the water he thought it was done and that was like in 1960
something he did that and then you know mid 1990s um we're bringing beaver bundles back
sexy too
and uh yeah we uh we brought that one back from harvard
um and and that was transferred to allen now uh the song there was song coming out of the museum
was the uh the snake man song when he cried anyway really the victory song yeah
ah
That was that was a song Alan saying bringing the beaver bundle out and
Everybody climbed in that van and I was like shaking hands. They were all nervous. They're like, come on. Come on
Like we just robbed the bank
We got this bundle. Let's go. Yeah
Before they change their minds, yeah, exactly, right
But yeah, we went out we went out to mash and tuck it
Everybody enjoyed the casino had a good time
Brought it brought him back to Boston everybody got their plane back
But Carol and Tom had an extra day and Carol was the one actually bringing the beaver bundle back
Had to go through Montana first
and
And so
Yeah, Carol
Carol and Tom spent an extra day with me I got to tour them around Boston and stuff and
show them my place and
We had a good time. I got to know Carol really well. She ended up becoming the female elder
For the beaver bundle when I got transferred so she taught Adrienne
Yeah, and
When did the bundle leave the museum?
That was May of 1996 I
Started negotiating I think
You know October of November the first of the previous year
So it wasn't it wasn't that long a thing to go through
But it was it I was intense. It was my whole life at that time
You know and one side and one side got that bundle out of the museum
Um the sense that I felt was that like
I've done something, you know like oh, yeah
If I if I if I fucking die
It's okay
So I've done something. Yeah, you know, yeah
So
That bundle went home Alan got transferred and
Then a bottom month later Joyce Spoonhunter calls me and
Says hey, you know that group of elders that came up to Harvard to pick up that bundle
Yeah
So oh there they're going on another tour
They're going to be in Washington DC and then New York and then Chicago
Um I can't go with them but somebody really needs to be there to document
The collections do you think you could do it
So
Yeah, I used what was left of my GI bill
Went on tour with the elders I
Went to meet them in Washington DC. They had no idea I was coming Joyce didn't tell them I
I
Showed up at
The Smithsonian or no was it the Smithsonian? No, it was at the it was at the hotel that we're gonna stay at that night
I think but it was some it was a very regal hotel. I
Don't know where we're staying but it was it was good duds
and
I
Remember I remember seeing four or five of the elders sitting on a marble bench
In the in the foyer
Hope that's fine. Yeah
I'm sorry about this
Okay, sorry for elders sitting on the marble bench
So we left four elders sitting on the marble bench and what which museum
This is in Washington DC. I I can't remember if we
If I actually met them at the Smithsonian to begin with or at our hotel
I think it was probably at our hotel
But it was very regal
It was it was it was right down by the mall somewhere
It was it was fancy digs and
That night I just remember it was very kind of a romantic night. I
Came into
There were four or five people on the bench. There was somebody I didn't know a
young woman
And the others that I've met from before and I think
Narcissus and Martin were there
I think and on that bench
And I think it was one of the two of them
There was like, you know, oh you came all the way from Harvard
You know, like like what what are you doing here? You know, I thought you were with Harvard. I'm like, no, no, no, no
That's where I explained it right there at that bench
Hmm. Ah
They still didn't know they didn't know the whole time. No, oh my goodness
They still thought I was from Harvard
Wow
Um
So, yeah, I I think one of the guys was Narcissus because at that point we rented a limousine
And I was in the limousine I know
with Narcissus and
Alvin his wife and
The young woman who was Margaret Croppierd-Wolf
The one who I didn't know then the new the new player in the group
And
We drove around Washington DC that night and looked at all the cool sights like we were like, you know to the limo driver
You know take us to the Lincoln Memorial take us to this take us to that
We just went to all the cool sights and looked at them with the
With the night light shining on them and all that stuff, you know
That was it was our opportunity
Like we didn't have we weren't gonna have time we're gonna see the museum the next day and then we're gonna be off to New York
So it was that night to see Washington DC
for that I'd already been there but
But it was it was a different kind of visit and so it was it was fun
I toured that night with with Narcissus and Alvin and Margaret and
went around to those
All around Washington DC and had fun
and
Then
The next day we went to the Smithsonian and the Smithsonian security
Is
The highest order like I was I was in military intelligence. I
Was a signals intelligence analyst in the US Army in 98 Charlie
I work top secret missions and stuff and
Like the areas that I worked were not nearly as protected as the Smithsonian's
museum storage
So to get to to get into the Smithsonian's museum storage
What you have to do is go right down to the mall
To the Smith you have to have it set up beforehand, of course, of course, yeah
Yeah, but when that when that when the time has come and you wanted and your day is in your day is there and your appointments there
You're gonna go into storage with in the Smithsonian. You go down to the mall
To the appropriate museum mine was the Natural History Museum
And
You give them your passport and driver's license
And in exchange for that they give you a
Identification card that lets you onto a bus
That bus drives you out of Washington DC
Into a
Maryland to a storage facility
That is just it looks like a it looks like like I've seen lots of maximum security prisons in my life
Across the country. It looks like a maximum security prison. It's all razor wire, you know
double set
perimeter and
you
Go through a gate that the van driver takes you through a gate you pull up to the facility and
When you go in the doors
You exchange your badge that they gave you at the museum
For a badge at this at the storage place and you fill out some paperwork
About yourself
Just basic stuff, you know
They've already set this up and
You
You know, basically you're just signing in you taking a badge and all this and then they assign you
An escort and
So for each member of our party there was a Smithsonian escort
To go through the facilities with
Wow and and and it's massive hey there their facility is massive. Yeah
They got a lot of stuff
And
I've been at the new facility next door to that now as well
Which is the new facility for the American Museum of the or the National Museum of the American Indian, which is a newer
Complex
Even more high-tech but but the all the security stuff is the same hey you have to really go through your shit
Um
Yeah, so it's and then we went through the Smithsonian
We videotaped it
Wait, was that the time no we didn't videotape that time sketch that
Smithsonian later and video with Alan and Chris
That time what happened was the very first thing
Like Joyce had sent me there to take photographs of everything in the collections
And to take notes of everything
You know that they were saying about the collections and all that stuff to document the whole thing, right?
So I took out my camera
Right away and started getting set up and
Martin
My future father-in-law
Said to me. Oh
I hope this isn't gonna end up in the national or the the National Geographic
That's what I hope this isn't gonna end up in the National Geographic
And then I was like, I don't gotta take photographs. You don't want and I put I put it away and
That
Seemed to buy me something
You know
With Martin maybe with others too, yeah
The rest of the day we looked at the the whole collection
I took lots of notes and everything of what they were talking about what they were saying and all of this
But clearly there was a concern about using the camera
