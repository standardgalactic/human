their ceremonial things back
From Harvard for a couple of years at least and
Just was just getting shut down
They heard that somebody got something
Can we hire you we've we've got this anthropologist
Who who has worked with us since the 70s who help you, you know
She lives in New York City. You can stay with her. She's got a giant hoopa library, you know
So I took a contract with the hoopa
And then Martin invited me before I went to the hoopa or to New York City
I was still in Boston, but Martin had invited me to a ganotesis a winter ceremony
And so I flew back out to Alberta
to do the ganotesis and
When that at that point like I couldn't stay in a teepee it was winter
So I stayed at Martin's house
And he gave me a truck to use
And he said I need you to
Um
While you're staying here you can use this truck, but I need you to drive
Dan yell around
You know, she needs to she has to go to college every day
But wasn't just like I'd take her to college
Drop her off and bring her back home at the end of the day and stuff and then
But then in evening, you know if anything wasn't particularly happened Martin would be like hey
Maybe you should take the truck and Danielle and go into town and go see a movie or something, you know
He's just encouraging us to be around each other it seemed to me
yeah, and
You know one thing led to another and then I
Was supposed to be going home
I was supposed to be going to Boston and then going to New York
The my flight
It was a particular day and Martin was supposed to bring me down to Great Falls to
To set me off
As we headed down he started going down the back roads of the blood research
I
Never I
Never
Realized it, but we never got off the blood research
Well, I know it now
But he is he was just driving he was just stalling
Driving around the back roads driving around the back roads
Until my flight was I'm gonna be late for my flight
And he's then you know, I'm like I'm not gonna we haven't even crossed the border. I'm not gonna make you
He's like oh, yeah
Well, we should reschedule your flight
Let's go to the lake and check out this there's this place where there's supposed to be these human footprints from like 10,000 years ago, you know
Let's go check those out. So we went to go like explore and have fun and stuff
But basically I missed my flight and I re rebooked my flight for like another
Week or something an extra week, but that bought me time
because
Danielle and I had just kind of got found out by her parents and by Martin and Pam that we were
Hanging out a little more than just driving her to school and stuff and whatever and
And
And so I think Martin bought me some more time with her basically, you know, but anyway, I like
I end up staying there some more
Even though I was supposed to go and then when I went
Then I just sent Danielle a ticket to follow me
And I brought her to New York
uh
with me and
We subsequently eloped
And I started working the hoop pockets, which is a whole nother story
I
Don't know do we want to get into that part or what do we what do you want to do?
Or do you have questions or about any like I continue to do from there
Like I just went into a repatriation like eventually I get to the meteorites and all that shit, too
but um, I
Continue to work black for repatriations, but I started
With a hoop out contacting me let me know that maybe I
Can use what I'm doing to help
Like other people and to make a living because I've been here to for like doing all my repatriation stuff for the black fit
just on my own dime
just for the experience and
Then the the hoop a con contract to me I thought oh
Well, one thing that I've got I've got a database of more than 4,000 worldwide museums that have native collections, you know
Maybe another tribe would want me to recontact those museums and ask for their
Inventories, you know or you know, right?
So I started pitching that around
I
Eventually I got a bite on that from the confederate tribes of Grand Ron and Oregon where I grew up the Kalapuya
mostly
But
Yeah, before that I was in New York. I lived in New York City in the city island
for I
Think I think Mahoney and I were there like four months something like that
The first part of the project
We went to Harvard
To go look at the collection
Okay, and I went with
hoopas
Well, the whole thing like I worked with her with her name was Lee Davis
She's a famous anthropologist
She's she's from your area. She's she's at Berkeley or her last place of employment was at Berkeley
that I knew of but
Like after she worked with me she went to Berkeley again. Yeah, she'd been there before
but
So she was with me the whole time but me and her ended up not getting along
very well at all
Me and Lee. Yeah
Yeah, I'd rather just do my own contract
And uh, not have not have to be in any kind of thing with Lee
Um
But it was it was interesting
You know
We we went to Harvard
first
and
We were um, this was even before Mahoney got there. Hey before uh, Daniel
Before I flew her there when I first got there our first step was we got to go look at the collection
you know
So we went to Harvard
and
Um
Going through the collection an event happened
We were
Pulling like the way that we had we had at work and
was
We were trying to photograph everything
So we could take the photographs and bring them back to California to the Hoop I elders
Share the photographs with them and then get there get them talking about the things, you know
Um, so I could write my claim
and
Um when we were going through the stacks at the Peabody
Anne Marie was with me again
and Marie Victor Howe
and uh, she would
actually like take the item from the drawer
She might have to climb a ladder
A lot of things are up high and shit
She takes an item from a drawer
and
She passes it down to Lee
And Lee would read out the tag number on it
and description
And give it to me
And I had a clipboard
That I would check off the item. So I knew we got each item on the inventory
And when she passed it to me I take the item and I had a
Uh a cart
Hey
And I put it on the cart
And we were going to wheel that into another room
With better lighting and take photographs
So as we're going through the storage
Anne Marie
Picks up this thing from a drawer up high in a ladder
and hands it down
and
Lee Davis
says
stone pipe
98127 whatever the fuck the number was, you know
stone pipe
And hands it to me
and as I'm as I'm
like
Less than a second
From touching it
I can see that this is not a smoking pipe
But this is a this is a is a stone pipe, but it's a it's a board through
Yeah
This is something that doctors used to suck sickness out of people with
And
I that
Recognition hit my mind just as I touched it
And then it was like it was like uh electricity went through my body
And I I started blacking out
And it took everything like
All the concentration that I had
To to put that thing on the cart and let go of it
Before a blacking out and I didn't black out
but
Wait, wait. Okay
Finally six
Okay, we'll go we'll go to the next. Yeah one. Yeah
So you you're at the museum they hand you down the stone pipe
You touch just as you're starting to reach for it. You realize this isn't a smoking pipe
Yeah, I I know what it is. Yeah, you know
I recognize it. I recognize it just at the point where I'm touching it. Yeah
And it almost knocks me to the ground
Like I I don't know I I've had no comparable experience except for one other artifact
That I touched in the museum later that maybe we'll get to
At a further point, but
This was the most intensive this kind of thing
And it it really felt like I was being just
Like I don't know
I was being put to sleep
Electrically in a weird way
And um
I resisted it
Enough to put the the the pipe that I think if I had held on to it even a fraction of a second later
I'd have been on the ground, you know
Like I just barely managed to put that pipe down
Without passing out
And then I immediately
had the worst
kind of
flew and cold
symptoms
like
Flood me in the next five minutes
