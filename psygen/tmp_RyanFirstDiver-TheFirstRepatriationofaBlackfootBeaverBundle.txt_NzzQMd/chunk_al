Wow
that
I had to bow out for the day
um
Like leave the museum
Go to my hotel
And I slept for I think you at 14 hours
And woke up okay again
Hmm
But it was the most bizarre thing
um
But the Hoopa the Hoopa ended up loving it
um
You know, of course I I reported it
Uh later to them like we visited harvard
Photographed all of their stuff and most of the stuff that they wanted out is
Like they're
They're whole traditions very like it's different from the black foot
by a by a long shot Hoopa
Um, they really surprised me like I'm from the west coast. I grew up in
western oregon
And the Hoopa are in this little valley called trinity valley
northern northern california by eureka eureka area kind of you know red woody area
Um, they're they're trinity river spills into the what?
Clameth
Clameth
That goes into the ocean
And what's very interesting there is this where the trinity river meets the clameth
Right you're gonna get a t intersection
Um, the Hoopa is on the trinity river, which is just like a mile and a half long and that's their whole territory
It's maybe maybe a mile and a half wide and a mile and a half long or something like that. It's a very short thing. Okay
Um, the the the Hoopa are there
ups when they hit the t upstream from the t
is karuk and
And
downstream is yurok
And the downstream feeds into the ocean right so yurok connected the ocean
But those three tribes the Hoopa and the karuk and the yurok
Um
Speak entirely different languages from entirely different language families
But practice the exact same
cultural complex and ceremonies and all of that stuff
This is this is one of the cases that
um
Friends boas the first american anthropologists used to try to disprove
That there is any connection
But between culture language and race
So any case they surprised me because
They're um, they still got a lot of their culture
They still got their language. They still got their ceremonies
Um, I experienced magic in Hoopa Valley
Like serious magic, you know
And
um
Yeah, it's it's something else and they're very different like in the old blackfoot stories
Way way back in napi era, which is like the earliest blackfoot stories
Maybe 12 000 plus years ago
The men and the women lived in separate camps
You know
And there's a there's a story
And the place here called Aki Pisk on the women's buffalo jump where it took place
Where where the men and women finally came together to like to live together
here
But before that
Men and women had lived in separate camps and basically women had
pre-pubescent boys with them
You know
But then once they hit puberty they'd go to the men's camp
I can see yeah
And it's it's following, you know, kind of like ungulate type of
knowledge
Here like the deer in the Hoopa. It's the deer
I think here it was the bison
you know
But uh in the Hoopa is the deer
for sure
and
There's a time when the deer get together
for the rut
And that was the only time a year where the men and women could like live together
And so if you were not born
Basically as a tourist like April into May
You are considered illegitimate child in the in the Hoopa. Ah, I see
You were not conceived when men and women are supposed to be together, right?
And that's kind of still the case there
even though
Even though they still like they like they live now
Men like people live with their spouses and all that jazz, you know
my experience there was that
the men are very
effeminate and
The women are very
You know butchie
And it's it's a it's a different kind and they're still like kind of talking about that stuff and in that mind zone, you know, like
Um, yes, yes
It's their way of life. It's their way of life
It is preserved. It's still going on
And we went into their old villages like the old pit houses and stuff where they still do their ceremonies and things
There are um very important
features
that have gone
Missing
from the like official like uh, like if you look at pictures of those villages
At the turn of the century
compared to pictures of the villages in the 1950s or 60s, you're gonna see
Really important things are missing
Those things are still there. They're just like they're just hit
They're there. They're all there everything is everything is still there
um
and uh
There's weird things that can go on there
Yeah, that gives us a good lead in for another chapter
Sure
I I just feel so grateful to be able to be with you tonight and hear these stories. Yeah
It's crazy like I don't know. I don't even like it's it's weird to be uh retelling them because
Um
It seems so fantastic a lot of it now, you know
And I'm just like regular
Blood Indian uh desperate and lethbridge, you know
Yes, well, they were um, they were glorious
They're glorious moments that live on
Still
Yeah
Yeah, it's all still part of part of the whole
Like those are history
that have made
Major ripples like what we did bringing that stuff back
Has changed
Account like it's hard to even imagine how much has changed
The community and the people, you know
A
lot
Education is totally different
I mean as a result
Thank you so much for sharing these I I hope we'll get to um
Continue in a in a very
You know
Nearby moment
In the recording here, we can keep talking
But uh, thank you for for sharing all this rhyme. So you bet so grateful
You bet
You
You
You
You
You
