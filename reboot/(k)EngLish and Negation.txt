Hello everybody. Welcome. It's going to be a little huffing and I'm climbing some stairs
up the side of a relatively steep incline. There are strange features of English and I don't know
enough about other human languages to be certain, but it seems extremely likely
that the languages carry a payload and we're not inclined to be aware of this or understand it
ordinarily unless
we have an unusual purpose or we are very passionately trying to understand it or
our curiosity is profound, right? Really want to know hidden things.
I've spoken of this before when I've said
that our experience of in-languaging smuggles something in. It smuggles in a bunch of weird games
and some of these are metaphors. Some of them are sayings, right? Figurative speech,
but they are also
invisibly powerful inclinations to think about identity meaning transactions and
relationships in very specific ways that have a lot to do with the historical development
of the language we speak.
Wow, a bunch of Verte China. It's kind of crazy. You find weird things along the street in San Francisco,
believe me. So, for example, there's an us versus them. There's a very strong us versus them,
what would I call it, principle that hovers almost tyrannically in the background
over modern English, particularly as it's spoken in the United States,
but probably something similar is going on elsewhere. There's a very us versus themist
feature of the underpinnings of the suppositions we acquire naturally by speaking our language
with other speakers who have also acquired them and communicate them these little figures of
speech, right? These almost cartoon ideas. They are, it is as if they are actually sketched figures,
but in language. I wonder what today modern young people would think of the phrase Uncle Sam
wants you, but in my mind, it flashes a kind of a red, white, and blue image of, you know,
Colonel Sanders' weirder brother pointing his index finger out of the frame of the poster
directly at me as if he actually sees me. And in English, it's worse because in a sense,
to be seen is to be seized by being seen, and to see is to seize. This is the kind of dangerous,
weird, pun-like understructure that we didn't invent most of us are unaware of. And
there are aspects of our cognition and psyche that are aware of them.
Making them conscious, well, it's either way you're going to have trouble, but you'd probably
rather have the trouble with what you can see than have a lot of trouble around stuff you can't see.
You don't notice. You don't have the the
the perspectival awareness of the kind to look from a certain angle within yourself at how
behavior is structured and so forth, how language structures behavior.
And there are many experts of different fields who are profoundly aware of this in a way
that is technical. So languages bring with them payloads and the problem with ours
is that the payload isn't old enough or rich enough compared to a language that was spoken.
I mean, what is English? It's a bastard child of the speech of the United Kingdom or something.
In fact, we might even say that one of the weirdest things about English's payload is that
it kind of encourages megalomania. I can see a cartoon where somebody's thinking carefully
about the evolution of English and discovers a leg of the history where kings are giving legal
decrees and they're declaring them and they're writing them. And you can be the king too,
just speak the language of the king and take the K off. Kinglish becomes English.
Like literally it's as if her ancestors were saying, it's kingish speaking.
It's a language of local authority, declaration, separate persons.
It dispenses with timelines and relationships
as easily as a hitman loads his gun. This stuff in the wrong hands is
lethally dangerous and it comes to us from histories
that were profoundly fraught, conflicted,
acting sometimes amorally as if the words told them what to do.
This is a people captured by the authority of language. We are that people.
And if you look closely, you will see if you study how people think,
how they think about how they speak,
how their behavior changes. If you modulate a couple of variables in the language,
how under some circumstances ordinary people
will are capable of saying things so profound that you might only hear such an utterance once
in your lifetime and under other circumstances articulate people
cower and begin to mumble.
Incoherently. It's not that we have language. That would be a really wonderful thing. Language has us.
That is not a wonderful thing. That is an insane thing.
And you know I can hear countervailing opinions.
We use language coherently. It's helpful, useful for memory, the organization of identities,
databases in memory and complex relations between features in memory that now have
a new way of existing in memory that isn't merely straight up nervous system,
but includes some map making techniques.
And mostly these are around identity function or activity. Identity activity and what you might
call origin or clade. Which class of thing, situation, being, relationship, perspective,
understanding, so forth. Categorical class profusion is one of the problems we get.
But you know the classes can be relatively simply stated. It's an object or it's being.
And if it's being, it may have other properties such as what class is it, animal, vegetable,
mineral. Of course mineral is not usually considered a being. For some reason
the privilege of beingness is reserved for organisms in many of these tables.
That could be extremely problematical because
it'd be a really staggeringly important thing to get wrong if you were going to get something
wrong. To evict being from objects if indeed there's something like a superposition over
intelligences that is involved with how objects are structured and why they persist and so on.
My point though is that the languages carry payloads in older languages. They also have
dangerous parts of the payload but they have traditional features that are very complex and
rich. One would probably be endlessly edified. I'm suspecting anyway from the profuse intelligences
and playful perspectives one might find in conversation in Sanskrit among scholars of
their language, history, philosophy. There tend to be this clade of folks and they're all throughout
the world but in India the gurus are, many of them are quite profoundly learned.
We have quite profoundly learned people over here see there's that us and them game,
them and us. We have meaning Americans. Some of the older languages, large parts of the payload
that get imported as you become and language are much more complex and much less prone to
the idea of the sovereignty of the individual which easily breeds war. If you're by yourself
in the world you better be mighty tough because any old thing can eat you up.
The suppositions of individuality, I mean it's very hard to understand if there were any successful
individuals historically, people who just became somehow on their own. In many cases
it could easily be understood as a fate worse than death. Why would anyone want to be alone?
The only benefit of being alone, well it's not true. I have to be careful. I've fallen under
the sway of some of the baggage in English that I'm trying to point out. See I too am subject to it
but then there are also, so I think okay what are we going to do then? What's the
there's the problem? What's the solution? I heard some women say today.
Well if we can teach each other we can easily discover the baggage together if we are looking for
it and not in the sense of having a kind of a witch hunt either yelling at the language that's a
dumb idea. We just would improve you know make better linguistic choices and we'd probably
modify intelligently, continually update the way we relate with categories themselves
and we'd realize the difference between the words we're making in situations that we're using them
in and for. We would teach each other to be aware of some of this baggage. I think there's a book
this is Lakoff one of the authors maybe metaphors we live by or something like this
and that shows a little bit of the baggage but just the metaphoric stuff there's all kinds of other
stuff not just metaphoric figures and not just rhetorical figures little phrases that indicate
ideas you know let your enemy go first
if there's a problem on the battlefield
let someone else take the damage right which is another idea we're a bit like pigeons in this
sense right we clump together in cities which does provide some degree of protection of individuals
quote unquote but also many new threats I think throughout the history of our people you know
our species there were very few situations where individuals
were common though there were unusual persons whose relationship with their
originating peoples became very unusual there have always been those there have always been
something that resembles a doctor something that resembles a philosopher something that
resembles a seer or a prophet something that resembles a scout or a ranger something that
resembles a knight a kind of a blessed battle knight who takes on weird difficult enemies
there've always been these kinds of things these kinds of roles and persons in human history
always in fact if you go back very far you're probably going to find that
if you could just transport yourself back to such a situation as a as an unseen observer say
um as an observer that having no effect the first problem you run into is someone would
realize you are the seen them right they can't see you but somebody will realize that you're
seeing them little girl old woman you know the unusual teenage boy who sees things and
and doesn't speak in the same vernacular you see that's part of the payload of the language
it's vernacular that's the word I was the concept I was looking for it's part of the payload it's
not the whole thing there's a bunch of games about value and identity how to evaluate when to
evaluate um again you can see this problem where it's very it really like English really is more
like kinglish right I'm the god of the world I could say whatever I want I can do whatever I want
you know right like I have no there is no constraining web of conserved traditions relationships
heritages lineages families that's all gone you're on your own with a gun I mean this is
the proposition right you got a car I'm just remembering that that crazy quote
from wise blood I think it is that was used so brilliantly in the beginning of Jesus built my
hot rod how does it go man I used to be able to do it with fervor she's it even worth it if I can
where you come from is gone where you thought you're going weren't never there
it goes on something about like nobody with a good car need to worry about nothing
and this is the spirit of the English we are taught it's you are alone you're by yourself
you are an individual you determine what is true what is good what is wrong what is evil
you know locally yourself you make all the decisions you make all the evaluations
somehow you're supposed to be as intelligent as a group of seven people with 12 different
kinds of skills all by yourself and the insecurity that the inward insecurity that this naturally
generates this lack of one's inaction people which is counterfeited in jobs and companies right
this lack of approval reassurance cooperation playful you know
leaping up the developmental ladders together while resolving important like actually noble
mission that matter this is built into our people and compromised by our culture
we were not all born for the same thing but we were not born to be isolates there were isolates
occasionally there were scouts who didn't live in the camp right they traveled with the people
maybe in a tribe right they would travel with them but they were never there
they were always out and they would come back and bring intelligence about you know the extended
terrain and what they saw and sensed in it that kind of thing and you can see that in a way many
humans try to do this they're trying to do it all humans have a deep relationship with predicting
the future we pretend in our materialist worldview this is supposed to be impossible
life organisms on earth have been doing that since fucking cell number one
there's nothing on earth that doesn't do that and if someone asks me will show me the physical
evidence what i'm probably going to say is the blinders that you're currently wearing are so thick
that the evidence your own hand comprises evades you
how will i show you anything people who are determined to not see and not learn
and to you know sit on the kingly throne of their the fact that they speak english and maybe can do
some math if they're lucky in terms of the rest of the world the hubris of that is unimaginable
you know there are fifth graders in pakistan that can out teach our calculus teachers in universities
um we are not as a people well educated and our and and so you can see how the english speaking
nests creates an inherent insecurity leads to an inherent insecurity insecurity because we speak
as if we are kings and queens and you'll hear um very confused humans on the internet saying
things about like this we are kings we are queens we are goddesses we are gods um it's not entirely
that they're wrong but that particular way of um holding on to it or broadcasting it
has nothing to do it's you're doing the opposite of what you're saying
uh cognitive and relational and behavioral sovereignty isn't all it's cracked up to be
when it leads to isolation and you know the sorts of despair that lead to people to just
play video games or just drink themselves silly and watch you know streaming shows or whatever the
the lost
whatever the catastrophe of semi vampiric consumption is
and i'm not yelling at those people um the context we're living in is so it's it's literally like a
vacuum of 20 of the things that we need every day just to be human together or even by ourselves
and it doesn't mean we have to all be clumped together all the time either it means
we have to have meaningful roles relationships and dimensions of identity that we enact
together successfully for learning and mutual benefit that one thing that thing we need that
and some will say well i don't really and i'll say well i hope you're not working or anything
well i need money well why do you need money i mean the conversation quickly travels into
an exploration of um how we get set up to try to acquire an abstraction of relationships value
um nourishment healing love so forth
i was thinking earlier that it's very peculiar if i say for example in english and i'm sure this
is this part kind of this sort of weirdness is probably true in other languages if i say to you
you i'm not going to talk to you about leverage or succession
you can see that the speech act itself is doing the opposite of what it is saying
and this is a kind of this is a figure of speech this is one of the forms of vernacular
similarly if i say truly our next guest needs no introduction what do you suppose is coming after
that and so you would imagine that intelligent people would realize there's a problem with the
construct but it's become traditional to employ a flawed construct in this particular case in the
case of that specific figure of speech so it is possible
if i were to try to say to you you know i really really mean everything i'm saying
it's not very helpful but if i show you that i mean what i'm saying if i if my passion is
contagious if my curiosity is contagious there won't be any use in me saying things about meaning
things or not right if you place a delicious meal before people they will enjoy and consume it
if you keep talking about how good the meal is many of them will eventually depart
they won't even eat it and so this is another thing that english imports
uh you know arians braggadocio bragging peacocking which in case it isn't obvious
you know older peoples
they have some unique people you know language the language and people the people they have some
unique uh recollection that part of what their languages import is a tradition against certain
kinds of speech and moderns might say oh yes they're very superstitious about speaking no
even though there may be features of that that aren't there may be some threads of that throughout
the language what's actually in there is intelligence about
the unexpected consequences of inelegant speech or hubris in speaking or arrogance in speaking
think of how many people you know
who
who will think something resembling
if you really want something if you want something that's really difficult to obtain or
very precious don't speak about it or you can imagine some teenagers driving driving the car
downtown on a friday night it's all packed down there there's no no parking and they're trying
to find a parking space you know and they they almost get one you know something happens where
someone says something about like i think we're gonna get it i think we're gonna get a space and
they the other two freak out and say he jinxed us and then a few moments later a space that they
were next in line for is gets taken right and they think oh it was the speaking was a problem
there are many traditions about clumsy speech inelegant speech and by inelegant i mean crude
surely it should be obvious
that the way we relate with language has a structural
effect on our imagination our cognition um how we respond to ambiguity what causes or
relaxes vigilance in us all of these things so
you know i never realized before tonight many of the things that i have spoken around
particularly the whole kinglish thing
and the irony and danger of speaking as if
one is the the pinnacle of authority
that the one from which all measurement comes right that is actually the kingly queenly
power it is to measure to meet out
this is the power that is given to judges in a sense in courtrooms which
is one of the weirdest caricatures of justice imaginable
though any reduction in humans torturing other humans makes me happy
but transforming it so that it's not physically vicious to the degree it is emotionally and
relationally vicious it's very strange and by the way you can see it should be obvious that uh
the solitude and individuality the namelessness in a prison experience is meant to be torture
of course they take many freedoms away
but it's funny because by doing that
that
they incline the prisoners to cooperation problem is the prisoners have been scripted
to form and obey
mostly malignant hierarchies
what are called cars in prison
you have to pick one when you go in and
it's the worst boy network
mostly
the people who are willing to act amorally and with violence run the system
it's an underworld inside our world and that's a world made by english
the payloads of other countries carry traditional ideas of
filial virtue, communal unity, mutual caretaking, respect for elders and children
and you know often there's some
problematical authority that comes along with it
respect for the provisional leader of the counterfeit country we grew up in
i think the goal of our country was to be was to resist counterfeiting in a sense
which is a very ironic mission to undertake
because in the same way i said
if i say i'm not going to speak to you tonight about leverage and succession
all right once i announce leverage and succession if i announce
we will work together to ensure that our country can't be counterfeited or stolen
by bad ideas people lethal games of language and concept we will
keep the light of human relational communal
and cognitive liberty alive together
you know four of the people signing the document are going to defect tomorrow
there is so much money to be made so much gold to be stolen so many lives to be converted
to misery for the sake of tokens numbers
and we inherited these near-term histories during our lifetimes while english changed around us
to reflect
the ever deeper counterfeiting
of virtue, verity and vigilance
and when i say virtue
i mean
the accessible origins of that principle as they exist in our own hearts
not some dictatorial list where we can check off the boxes
i mean the real stuff
and similarly a verity
a language that jump starts an amnesis
the capacity of a language
to deliver a payload that's incredibly profound and also largely
missing the pathogens
there must be languages
that have
there are branches of every language that carry
noble and heroic phalids there are branches
um
crucially
without being surrounded by a milieu
of rich creative literary philosophical and scientific diversity
and conversations and debate and exploration and celebration and literal heroism
how will we remember what it means to be human together
you know i'm not saying it can't happen to you at church or at school
or in the air force or the army
you're going to get something in there and i know what it'll be
but it'll be highly in service of counterfeit virtue
and straight up lying and straight up back stabbing back dealing
it almost doesn't even matter if there's a devil or not
because the humans sure act like there is one and there's a branch of us that's competing to
enact it and that branch tends to hold power because the altruists
aren't particularly you know
they're not particularly sword and sorcery
inclined they're not warriors
and once you involve warriors it seems you involve many dangers for counterfeiting
the problem though it seems to me i think it's very ironic and strange that i'm saying this
is that
okay your best few your five best plays are always going to be in the direction of establishing
something so amazing and human and intelligent that nobody wants to be left out
and then making that thing self-dissolving so that it has to be reformed from new principles
fairly regularly so that it doesn't become sclerotic and then you try not to conserve
hierarchical power in the structure of the systems the teams the families
and so forth
i wonder how far this street goes
there's a way to create a self-dissolving structure that leaps ahead in
its capacity
to perceive and resolve dangers
and it can do the same thing creatively technologically scientifically but it can do
it much better because if the recipients of advancements are trustworthy we can go a lot faster
together
also the problems our infrastructure societal infrastructure faces are monumental
and the existing
stuff
existing human electronic and physical infrastructure is delicate outdated
prone to fall apart on its own
if if we're lucky enough that nobody intentionally takes it down
so that stuff has to be remade our own government was supposed to be remade regularly
i think they thought
25 or more years per pulse something like this maybe
um
kinglish
yes it's weird there the connotative structure of english serves the conceptual proposition
of single persons
um which
that kind of inbreed the force of the inbreeding of comp of a competitive perspective
us and themism should be obvious there um
you better be able to table a lot of power as an individual if you want safety or
you have to gather together with many others somehow and how then do you preserve your
individualness you can it's what are called business relationships another idea imported
along with the english we learn business relationships are not personal relationships
vice versa though of course at the at higher hierarchies that's for the low hierarchies for
the higher ones um they go together you you always have both or you often have both
so
you know if you joined a monastery
say you decided
you would study zen or
invite a vedanta or
suphism
you would begin a new way of relating with being human
in a contemplative way in these cases i think
but also a educational transformation unless
and most of the people i knew for example who studied zen had very large libraries
and some of them had taught themselves sanskrit others had taught themselves chinese
these are not easy tasks sanskrit's probably easier in some ways
god i hope the street goes somewhere useful i think it's going way too far away from my house
i've just i've gone for a much longer walk than i had planned so
there are branches of study you know if you read if you read through philosophy or if you
study mathematics you essentially what you're doing is you're recapitulating the history of
mathematical development in our species it's the same thing with philosophy the study of ancient
languages what you are doing is you're you're having a um intellectual an amnesis you see
unforgettable and this is very profound so this is what i mean by there are branches in our culture
if your parents are artists and complex thinkers and creative or they are writers or poets or
musicians or all three you will at least have a local example of a milieu in which discovery
exploration play rediscovery awe wonder enthusiasm um and perhaps ecstasy or even visions it's not
is these are common you know the garden has all the plants right you just don't grow up with uh
we we just grow beans around here son and we don't lack strangers that you find all over
the united states again though any community is a bit like the topology of english
there's going to be artists and creatives and intellectuals and secret agents you know hidden
throughout the terrain it'd be good if we had a signal whereby we could easily recognize one
another and authenticate our um identities that'd be fun or or even a way of signaling rather than
a signal right a way of signaling that would evolve good languages do this um i think kinglish
english weirdly is a slave language
and there have been attempts to fix the problem before esperanto might be one of them
um i don't know a lot about it
but we who speak it and write it and read it presuming we can uh much
would do well to understand some of the the threat landscape of what english imports into
thought semantics and expectation
and at the same time forge new ways of referring
and playing in that field
uh
that preserve our communality our common concerns interests identities and so forth
where the actual hell
and what ridiculous street is this
okay i get it kind of not it's not clarendon
and
i think i walked to another city accidentally this is so
yeah i walked away way far away
all right so if i say to you i'm not going to be speaking this evening to you about
succession or leverage then you can see that i'm doing the opposite of what i am saying
another very strange modern common vernacular
that is ironic is um something like
before saying something someone says to you i'm not going to lie you know i
thought we were going to the football field right on as if
they're doing you the unusual favor of not lying
which is pretty strange
it's also become common and i sometimes do it
to make a statement and then congratulate myself or pretend that you're correct congratulating me
right and you don't even have to go all the way you can just go like right you can say part of it
right and people know you know what what's going on they know what time it is there's another
hello realism in english what time it is it's funny when i was talking about them earlier i
was trying to think of someone they just were not coming to my consciousness
so there is though a way of doing the opposite of that
so instead of doing the opposite of what i am claiming i am right now doing
i'm not going to talk i'm talking about right you know s and l l and s whatever
does this street go somewhere useful i am so fucking lost
okay i guess not i mean maybe who knows i can't fucking tell
there i am speaking ungracefully
oh my my my so
if you imagine a bubble of many bubbles and each of the bubbles are possible
choices or actions thoughts or ideas words etc so before i make a sentence i do have
the opportunity to imagine any any kind of sentence that is can be said
and to
there from traverse what we might think of as a series of choices selections negations
and so forth we could think of it that way probably isn't exactly that way
but i could think of these possibilities and then i form the actual sentence or
sequence of sentences that i have just spoken to you now so what i have done is i have told you
what i am doing while i am doing it i have done what i am saying it's the opposite of doing the
opposite of what i'm saying i will not speak of thus and such it's very difficult in english
to try to evade the problems that arise in negation i didn't do that it's already too much weirdness
it's very strange all of this this stuff
what the hell is going on there are street signs where there are no streets
where the flapping slot am i okay there's a street sign here for the sake of one house
or something i don't i don't know this is nuts oh i see okay i see
huh
this is probably where i want to go no i can't fucking know let's try it
so it is possible to do things that you are saying in english and there are certain kinds of speech
that actually allow you to accomplish a non-ordinary action by speaking very intelligently about the
potentials right about the uh where does this go i have no idea where the fuck i am i mean it
is so bizarre oh this is not where i want to go okay i'm just lost
there is a lot of detour around here
it's interesting to be lost but it's a little bit late at night for
for me okay so
you know language is a magical thing it becomes an everyday thing
many humans have discovered
that it's not necessarily that there are magic words quote unquote rather
it is that there are magical ways of relating words and consciousness
that produce very unusual and totally unexpected results
okay this is so funny i'm going to have to backtrack i basically almost did walk to another city
this is fucked
so
when you think about the difference
think about the difference in someone in someone's ability to see
into identity possibilities situations problems
in seven ways rather than three so the other night i was in a conversation
and someone asked me essentially what happened to cause the humans
to go insane and become
you know bad to each other in the world at least at the group levels a lot and certainly in many
of our cohorts and i said well in the first story there was something that actually resembles evil
and we couldn't keep away from it it was a duke it was attractive we grabbed some we got it on
us and it got inside us in the second story we had intelligent parents and they went away
there was an accident or something and they went away and then in the space
where the intelligent beings had interacted directly with our minds
the shadow of their absence terrified us and you know we we acquired an inner shadow in its likeness
and in the third story
the onset of tool building causes a problem
in how we structure consciousness
it makes us susceptible to
what i call thrips which are sort of like
viral behavioral language something like that
um
in the fit in the next story
there are two primary colors red and blue
we once had wise relation with both of them something in the structure of our minds changed
we lost relation with them and the imbalance produced an absence in us
that could act as if it were a being
and we struggle with this now i could keep making stories or rather vignettes
but what i want you to understand is
we are trained to a very problematic form of consciousness that i call one thing mind
one thing that's just this one thing mind but what we really want to have is like five thing mind
five thing mind not that one thing mind kill yourself run into wall not good blinding
and english imports this one valued identification system and
we want to preserve that where it is useful
and surpass it in our use of the language so that we realize quickly it's not just this it's not
just that one valued thinking
unfortunately there are people out there they're like i wonder what those UFOs are well they're
not one thing they might not even be a category of of phenomena we have a placeholder for in
our lexicon right like what if what if they represent for example the category
okay what if they represent
this will take me
yeah
what if they represent the super category of identity meaning of whatness and who-ness
if they are the super category they are not what or who they are is being in relation
okay what you do what you don't do this changes who you are and who they are
and this is intelligent and this is actually how damn near everything actually is
you know joe most of the time amazing guy catch him on a bad day not a lot of fun to be around
threatened one of his children um the monster in joe will certainly come out
unless joe's like super wise in which case he he will liquidly
um transform and and both resolve the problem and not have to become a monster
so identity right now if there's a position above our categories we should be familiar with that
position that is where our mind should dwell this is a structural feature of our
very confused relationships with semantic qualities and positions like ordinarily
a single speech speakers we inhabit a position underneath the lexicon or at best co-equal with it
we should not only inhabit a position above the lexicon cognitively relationally in our awareness
of the peculiarities of speaking and thinking in words writing and so forth we should naturally
draw each other up above the lexicon and up above the semantics if anyone should begin
to fall down into that ancient peoples were quite good at this they knew the danger of
believing the language they knew the danger of falling beneath it and having it tell you
what you are who to be blah blah blah and this isn't just a patriarchy problem this is a problem
with the capacity to speak as an individual as if you're individual this comes with that mess
it's not merely patriarchy though you know patriarchy and the suffering of many other
many what many clades many groups many persons
is certainly part and parcel of the payload of english okay is this the way i want to go this
looks like it might be although i really hope oh fuck where the flappity slot am i
and which way do i have to go
okay it looks like this way that's my thought
that says this is a dead end though
i sure hope i'm not going up that fucking mountain side that is not gonna work
that stairway is crazy insane we're talking about yeah that shit loopy
it would be like climbing up the side of a pyramid or something
so you can see that there's a position that is something like the un
the unformed potential
for
categories themselves in fact the the the word category
refers to that space right it's not a category it's the categories
and there's a position above that i think which is before the kinds of distinction
that would allow us to impose the concept of category
we want to be familiar with the places above language and remain aware
as we descend into those into the behaviors of speaking and writing and thought
so that
we retain a sort of what like a like those old divers lines right before they had tanks they
would lower guys in in suits with air hoses right we need to retain a link to the upscale
before of language and to the human the aspects of human intelligence above language
aspects of our own thought feeling no not knowing sensing perspective that are above
language and then travel down into it intelligently from above
then we will see many features that are otherwise invisible to us it gives us
it dimensionalizes the perspective in a in a variety of new ways and we when we tell
if we make a metaphor or something it's often better to make two or three rather than one
and we should avoid the construct it's just blah blah blah it's just this just that
except you know i'm not saying never we should never use such language but it's very deceptive
to the mind soon we think we know what everything is which is a huge problem because we don't really
know what anything is at all we have a bunch of tokens that we paint on familiar phenomena
that's it the name of the token doesn't tell you what that is it doesn't tell you much
in fact it's deceptively convenient right it reminds me of american culture deceptively
convenient hiding of a bitter isolation loneliness lack of communal
vast lack of communal organs
it is a profound liberty to be able to forge
complex cognition on you know within the manifold of our human experience
but it's also very dangerous it easily leads to unexpected and often invisible deprivations
and so there's a vast terrain of
um
impoverishments that many of us have suffered at the hands of the language we speak
it behooves us to gently and intelligently recompose ourselves
um beyond the confines to to help each other to recover the kinds of liberty in our thought
considerations learning and creativity that are natural to our people
but largely prohibited and counterfeited by our common cultures
this is my dream and i hope we will pursue it together
thanks for joining me my life for now
