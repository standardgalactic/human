Hello everybody. I'm out for a morning walk and there may be a little mic noise
and a little traffic noise but we'll do our best. So all of our models I was just
listening to a Lex Fridman podcast on free will and forgive me for not
recalling the name of his guest a woman researcher and they begin to talk
about suffering and the researcher posited that suffering and memory are
inextricably intertwined and this is interesting and their conversations
interesting even though I have problems with various parts of it but I want to
pose a very fundamental question our minds distinct and if so to what degree
are they explicitly distinct the way we pretend they are by pretending that my
mind is known only to me inside my skin and this is a clinical perspective from
a certain angle but it's also a philosophical perspective which means
it's a perspective that exists only if we admit certain assumptions or axioms
and if we validate those axioms then the resulting model in our thought
creates a boundary somewhere maybe at the surface of the skin maybe beyond that
slightly maybe within that slightly at which the local mind is expected to
cease right doesn't pass that boundary and everything about my human
experience and the experience that I have of being more than human which
frankly is most of my experience because if I had to accept only the definitions
of my humanity as they're commonly proposed and promulgated and scripted
in culture I would be a much more limited being than I have experience of
being of course this depends on our definition of human and how broad or
narrow it is and in what ways it is broader narrow but I've always felt
that the definitions are extremely primitive and they're primitive in
bizarre ways that have advanced in their primitivity as our technologies have
advanced in other words as we become a more technological species our ideas
about what it means to be human have dwindled to some very limiting and
confused perspectives so first I'm going to argue that most of what we are is
more than merely human a common argument for this if we're if we're going to be
somewhat scientific is that approximately half of our cells are
bacterial and those cells don't come from our human gene line which means at
least half of our body human though it appears at the boundary is within
itself not human we could imagine the bacterial hyper structures are less
than human but that seems unlikely since we can't be human without them
but let's think about minds is there any such thing as a mind that we could call
human that exists and develops in isolation no such things there are
precisely zero entirely isolated organisms at the very least they are
connected by belonging to the biosphere in the same way that sets and members
are connected and in a way I would argue that resembles how organs and bodies are
connected and I think the idea of connection is actually backwards
organisms appear to form vast relational hyper structures over time first and
foremost and in comparison their apparent individuality can be seen as
relatively trivial and it is useful to see it as relatively trivial so
it looks to me like the opposite of what we think is more like what's going on
and maybe dramatically more like what's going on you can see that in our
technologies we keep attempting to build representations of connections as if
we're trying to fill in a space that has been imagined to be missing but never
was empty of signals relationships developmental opportunism neg entropy
and all kinds of important things many of which we don't even have concepts for
let alone words about and this seems to be a tragic feature of our modernity to
me that we think and believe as if minds are fundamentally separate and we
treat them as separate and think that we are connecting them with signals across
wires now it's not untrue but what I'm proposing is that before we had the
wires we had better connections before we had radio we had something like
telepathy before we had telephones we had something like telepathy and it was
much more common in our experience precisely because there were no
representations no mechanical representations of this intrinsic
symbiotic union of all beings in all of time and various smaller cohorts the
beings in present time with us on earth now and so on to a smaller cohort as we
like to people we don't develop technologies out of thin air the way
that we imagine this process to occur often what happens is a relational
behavioral biological and perhaps even transcendental situation is replaced by
a representation of it so that we get television as a replacement for group
dreaming I'm gonna take a brief break here and I will return shortly when my
errand has proceeded a bit our intuitions about the distinctness the
separateness of organisms and minds don't come to us from nature they come to
us from culture language concept ideology and some people will say of course
anyone can say anything but some people will say well there's no proof that
there's something resembling telepathy and that may or may not be true depending
on what the standards of proof are and what the experiments that were performed
are who performed them what they were looking for and so on I've certainly had
direct experience of things events situations that cannot be other than
telepathic or rather again I think we've started the whole game from the wrong
side of concern and perception I think we have minds because there are billions
of organisms on earth that create a field effect in which minds naturally
arise as an emergent property of the field of biology on earth and that field
may have elements that are not that are engaged in time in an in nonlinear ways
thus it is possible to know something of the future and this is true even in our
representational behavior concern and so on we call the clinical concern with
futures different kinds of things in different contexts physics will tell us
the application of physics will tell us something of what to expect if a ball is
thrown and for more complex futures we have the study of probabilities which
very strangely and I think importantly can tell us fascinating and useful things
about cohorts or groups but very little if anything useful about what we think of
as individuals what if there are no individuals there's certainly no example
of an absolute individual all of the forms of life we see every instance of a
mind that we will ever encounter is an emergent embodiment and inaction of
characteristics hidden deep in not merely the relationships of the moment but
the entire history of life on earth
you can imagine that every organism that we can discern as distinct is a thread
and if we follow that thread back to its proximal origin its most proximal
origin we will find either a progenitor a pair of progenitors or a group of
progenitors and so you can see that with very few exceptions there aren't any
organisms that are alone that emerge alone live and die alone and in fact in
order to be clinical about biology and organisms we have to work very hard to
separate out all the other relationships so that we can control for them in
order to learn something very mechanically specific about a given
form of organism a specific organism or a cohort of them now some people might
be inclined to dismiss my anecdotal propositions or even declarations that
telepathy actually underlies just about everything but even if there's all kinds
of problems here that we don't ordinarily consider one of them is how
organisms hitchhike on each other and synchronize together to spread the
benefit of effort work done so on so that in a wing of Canadian geese each bird
is supported by the other birds and they switch positions within the wing
according to a vast array of variables that are all relational variables and
their variables of sensing of group behavior of symbiotic behavior and so
again I think it's backwards to start at the individual and then try to figure
out if it's connected to other things other beings other minds without other
minds there are no minds right all of our minds arose in a field of highly
structured human behavior much of which is representational but not all of which
is formally representational I think our ideas about the supernatural are
wrong but they're not wrong because nothing like these ideas exists they're
wrong because they're too simplistic the idea of telepathy for example begins
with the proposition that minds are fundamentally separately and don't
ordinarily connect except along those signal paths that we have already
discovered delineated described and are aware of that's not possibly true it's
not possible for that to be true that would suppose that we discovered all
the ways that minds connect to each other that will never happen that's an
impossible goal so it's certainly a fact that the limited ideas that we have
about connection are false to facts in nature so what I'm proposing here is that
we've really got the entire idea quite backwards that the nature of life on
earth is fundamentally transcendent it's more than sentient and not in some AI
funded way in a biorelational in a vast manifold of biorelational ways that
have been busy being themselves for as long as there's been life on earth and
probably before that and this brings us to the question of you know what's the
nature of time space and we ask questions like well could the universe be
conscious but what if the universe is something transcendental to consciousness
that produces consciousness as a mere side effect of its activities in these
domains that we have yet to form intelligent ideas of around and I would
say that this is by far the more likely situation the human concern with
utility and with mechanization and automation blinds us to most of what's
going on that can't be captured that way now I have had experiences where I know
for a fact that my mind was touching a distant mind without any ordinary
signaling apparatus operating between us for as an example at the moment of my
grandmother's death I had an elaborate dream involving her a musical dream a
beautiful dream and there was nothing connecting us except the fact that my
mother's body was an organ in her body long ago before it became a distinct
quote individual in the world and so to my body in my mother's body and so on
there's we're missing out on the vast library of features that biology clearly
is engaged in producing sustaining developing transforming over time and
part of the reason we're confused in general is because we have the wrong
idea about separation we think that separation means something resembling
explicitly distinctness and there's no example of this anywhere in nature this
is a clinical idea an idea of fiction of the laboratory a fable of the researcher
but it's the wrong fable it doesn't resemble life it resembles machines and machines don't resemble
life their relationship with time is entirely bizarrely flat compared to the
nature of organisms in their natural sort of meta symphony of relation over time and
this leads to leads me back to where I was before when I was beginning to say
that I think we're very confused about the nature of time in general certainly
that it resembles anything like our models is mostly wrong except in contexts where it's
appropriate and there are some contexts like that the staggering vista the frontier for human
knowledge and intelligence is not space-time or machines it's obviously it's consciousness and
awareness it's the nature of minds and their origins but it's also things that we have failed
to be bold enough to imagine about what's really going on around here inside our own bodies in
our relationships and in consciousness and most of what's going on for a lot of us is heavily
scripted it's scripted by our cultures our societies our languages the concepts they include
and the root concepts they exclude or never that never arose within them or that were snuffed out
by utilitarian concerns I've had many experiences that made obvious to me that our explanations
and ideas about what it means to be human or have a mind or if minds are separate are wrong
and I think they're mostly backwards if we lived in societies where these things were deeply
explored not superstitiously not as a religion but directly inquired into together with and for
each other an astonishing universe of other intelligences other forms of intelligences
and modes of intelligences disembodied intelligences and so on would naturally appear directly to our
experience not merely to our ideas and thoughts think with me for a moment about the unimaginable
complexity of a single second and if we draw the boundary just at the atmosphere of earth think
with me of the complexity of the signals and transformations that simply occur only in the
viral population of this world a population whose numbers are nearly incalculable though we could
perhaps you know posit some exponential number that represents that population think of time at
the scale of a virus think of the trillions of viruses in a single body and then extend that to
the entire planet the network of viral intelligence on earth so vastly supersedes anything that we
can imagine or encompass that it absolutely dwarfs the entire history of human knowledge why would
we believe knowledge why would we believe our beliefs in the face of something so staggeringly
beyond the wildest science fiction which the natural world actually is always and never isn't how did
we become so confused by our capacity to name and model and analyze very small features of the
vast universe the infinite universes within universes that biology naturally comprises
composes enacts and embodies and this is if we take you know I'm speaking as if merely the
physical layer is the only thing that's going on but that also cannot be true because again even
if we take the physical layer what we know of its qualities is unimaginably limited compared to the
actual qualities that exist there in fact in a single living organism there are infinite qualities in
a biosphere of trillions of organisms there are layered infinities of qualities that can never be
encompassed by thought belief or knowledge so why do we believe our thought belief in knowledge I
think one of the primary reasons is that it works in a utilitarian sense we can accomplish goals
many of those goals have to do with skipping time or changing temporality the computer the oven the
refrigerator these objects all specifically transform time the refrigerator slows it down by
slowing down the number of molecular transformations per second and the biological
transformations per second in bacteria and so on this is why we refrigerate our food
essentially primarily to both preserve it over time and to keep it from becoming highly
bacteriologically active so cold inhibits biotime and warmth generally tends to accelerate it
this whole time skipping agenda makes certain features of our behavior and mechanical ability
appear very compelling and profound but compared to the simplest organism they are trivial we believe
them because our common human experience is woven through with utilitarian goals the goals of
commodification representations transmission and exchange of commodity and representation but
where do these commodities come from they come from living beings there's no place else to get
them from around here we might argue that well gold isn't the result of living beings but the
commodification of gold is the result of living beings without living beings gold is perhaps
no more or less intrinsically valuable at least not to humans than any other substance it does
however seem that the material complexity of the living world is a crucial feature in producing
the robust expressions of organism organismiosis relation development and conservation over time
and so on that we're familiar with or rather or are we are we familiar with it to what degree are
we familiar with it and which portions of it acquire our attention awareness concern and
purpose of behavior part of what I'm trying to argue here is a is a strange argument proposed by
a scientist friend of mine dr. Kevin Baroo who said that the two different things right the first
thing he said is if we're going to just make shit up well then we can just make up anything and I
don't feel like that's useful or meaningful and that's a very abrupt sort of comment but he goes
on to say metaphysics are largely uninteresting to me because the actual complexity of physical
reality makes them look silly in comparison and I think there's something to that argument what's
actually going on the nature of time space and organisms and symbiosis in time space is so
astonishing that humans have failed to conceive of anything resembling yet and we are continually
forging new kinds of mechanical electronic and conceptual representations which is a pretty
strange behavior for a biological creature for the simple reason that that behavior begins to
compete directly not merely against the minds that engage in it but against the history and
future of life on earth and yes it's possible to damage the history of life what we as a species do
in this moment changes the meaning of the history of all of the living beings on earth and it
certainly changes the meaning of human history if we do something profoundly amazingly beautiful that
transforms the meaning of suffering that has been endured in previous time similarly if we do
something so catastrophically ignorant that it casts a pall on life on earth or become something
that we should surely be deeply ashamed of having done then similarly we have changed both the
history the meaning of that history and the meaning of the future at least for ourselves but certainly
for other creatures as well around here it looks to me like there's one family and the family has
transcendental origins and by that I just simply mean origins far beyond our capacity to imagine
model or consider at present but not beyond our capacity to participate in and this is the key
thing I'm trying to get across we are missing out on most of the potentials of our nature as
organisms as beings as consciousnesses awarenesses and as families of life traveling together and
doing something incredibly important together that certainly isn't the production of objects for
grocery stores or electronic objects to populate machines endlessly you know if we if we love
each other if we love life if we love nature if we love time space if we love our children we must
explore this frontier and freedom of the incredible incredibly cruel and arbitrary limitations that
our common conceptions impose on us yes there's the danger of madness there's the danger of
religion there's the danger but we face all these dangers anyway if our systems of thought or are so
primitive or crude that they largely exclude us from our own innate nature and abilities then we
must agree that they have failed to be anything resembling intelligence and if we agree that they
have failed then we must establish new frontiers with which we can recover direct experience and
understanding of the features of nature organisms and humans that don't fit in the models we've
become accustomed to obey I imagine the possibility of a radical and sudden transformation in the entire
network of human minds a transformation catalyzed by a small group of people who simply discover
together a few compelling features of our nature that have been blatantly ignored glossed over
weaponized in religion or for the sake of technology and so on and this gives me hope it's a dire
moment for life on earth right now it's an incredibly dire moment for the humans we have
you know it's funny as a species it's really as if we're possessed by demons or something there's
there's no there's nothing that resembles intelligence at the species level of our species our
societies and corporations our nations our staggering absurdities that have nothing to do with what's
going on on earth the nature of organisms the nature of consciousness or awareness except
perhaps as sort of the kinds of strange diseases that we might see on display at some freak show
if there are other intelligences in the universe if they visited earth they must either understand
intimately the catastrophes that led to the current situation for humans or they must think
there's something fundamentally wrong right they're using they're using consciousness time awareness
and potential to produce its opposite and importing entropy death and decimation to the
biosphere that otherwise is robustly negentropic I realized the other night as I was thinking
through some of these ideas that machines import entropy to into the biorelational anatomy of
our planet in ways that are dangerous and some of which are completely too invisible to us we
don't imagine for example as human beings that the earth might be doing something important
something so important that again it generates organisms and minds as a mere side effect of
this heroic activity it's engaged in its role in the solar system in interstellar space and in
time space itself we don't imagine that there are different modes of time but there certainly are
each object that we see whether it is a rock or a tree or a bird or a whale or a school of fish or
a mountain each of these features that appear to us visually and conceptually are hiding something
so astonishing that the slightest hint of it would obliterate what we think of as knowledge but
instead of seeking for direct experience of and participation in this grand quest that life on
earth is certainly about our species is busy doing the opposite right we're trying to tear all that
stuff down and build a bunch of mechanical processes instead and propagating hundreds of
millions of objects and and so on we're directly interfering in whatever it is the earth is doing
and whatever the earth is doing it is doing in concert with the sun with the sky with the origins
of the universe and the nature of time space each of the forms here each of the biologies is a unique
mode of temporalities myriad relational temporalities in effect a multi-dimensional temporal manifold
each of the organisms we see each of the natural objects we see have this quality but we do not
examine this or consider it together what has happened to so severely blind us one of the
strangest answers to this question can be drawn from a gloss on the Genesis story
once you can name things you can relate with the name and you can believe that you know the nature
of the thing because you have a way of calling it out and distinguishing it from all other things
and this particular capacity and the forms of memory that are associated with this capacity
are extremely dangerous if they develop unchecked they will lead to an animal not merely capable of
tearing down the biosphere but one that will become furiously compelled to do so in new ways and modes
per minute and that is the position it appears our species is in at the moment and that position
places us directly in conflict with whatever the mission of our world is and I would suggest that
it's not a single mission it's a symphony of missions bound together in a heroic
and very delicate context that is important in ways we've so far failed to imagine but we can
and I say that we will and I hope that you and I and others like us will continue the quest and
perhaps finally someday form a mission not to Mars but to the world of our origin a mission that
serves that world and its true natures and purposes in ways as beautiful and intelligent
as the nature of biology in time and space bring forth all around us moment to moment
thank you for joining me I look forward to learning again together soon
