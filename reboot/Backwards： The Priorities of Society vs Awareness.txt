just broke off and fell
After my last adventure in the Botanical Garden where I stood precisely on top of a Yellow Jacket Nest while following my, you know, curiosity but also my smartphone
While I was off trail
Most people would imagine that that would be a survivable mistake, however
I've had experiences with Yellow Jackets
And they can be lethal
I'm curious where the branch fell, so I'm sort of cautiously proceeding through the gardens
In case you've never seen one of these, this is a bird of paradise flower
And this is the plant that produces them
You can see the unopened blossoms
They're gorgeous
Somewhere nearby
Is a tree that just dropped a huge branch and hopefully it didn't drop that branch on a human being
I didn't hear anybody yelling, so that's a good sign
I know which kind of tree is likely to have dropped that branch
Also, though I heard the branch crack as if it were going to fall
I did not hear it hit the ground
And this is the most likely nearby culprit
A cypress tree
Those trees often drop gigantic branches
Wanging up to a couple of tons, I imagine
I'm going to try and be a lot more careful when I'm doing something that I've often advised against
Which is paying attention to my smartphone when I'm outside
I entirely avoided smartphone ownership as a technician
Until about three years ago when a specific employer sent me the one that I'm making this video on
And wanted to use it to communicate with me frequently
And even after I received this phone, I resisted carrying it with me outside for a good two years
And also when I did carry it, I didn't use it
And I remember the first time I used it, the shocking disappearance
The sudden, shocking disappearance of my awareness of the world around me
All I did was look at the screen and it seemed as though the world disappeared in my mind
My awareness of where I was, of place, of being, of relation, of danger
Completely disappeared when I looked into the screen just for a few moments
I didn't find that terribly, well actually I did find it terribly surprising
I had watched other people doing this for many years and had marveled at the seeming
Well, what's the right word?
The power of the device to distract and disorient us
And particularly in nature, in time, and in relationships
And those are most of what make our humanity recognizable and coherent
And so when machines disorient us there, we're really in very grave danger
I don't yet, and I probably never will, understand why the Yellow Jackets didn't swarm me
I was standing directly on top of their nest, but they didn't
And you know, explanations can be very deceptive
Because phenomenon can be multiply determined, right?
In other words, we can find an explanation that suffices to appear
To expose the causal relationships underlying phenomenal events
Expected and unexpected
But that doesn't, but even though they suffice to explain it
Reality and events are so staggeringly mysterious in their basis
That the beginning of the attempt to explain it all is already hugely problematic
It involves presuppositions we have no reasonable justification for asserting
Nature doesn't function on reasons
And causes are confusedly local in time and space
Which I would suggest we do not yet understand very well at all
Or are almost entirely confused about
The nature of the relationship between consciousness and temporality
Between existence and space-time
Between our personal experience and the phenomenon
I always get the plural of that wrong
I need to study this phenomenon that conspire to emerge as our waking minds
But there is another kind of mind that is not like our waking mind
And is much more like the strange reflection in this pool
Whereby looking down, I see up
But I don't, my eyes don't touch the things that are up
They touch their reflections
In a substance that in English we call water
And as you can see, the water, its surface
Is kind of alive with concentric events caused by things moving or touching its surface
Primarily water striders
But this reflectivity is hypnotic and beautiful
It is enchanting
And this pool was designed for us to be able to look down into the water
And see up into the sky
To see particularly the moon at night
Since the gardens are not open at night
Very few people have seen the reflection of the moon in this pool
But I am one of them
Now I don't have a particular topic before me in mind today
To share some of my recent reflections and experiences
Particularly about the peculiar flatness of the waking mind
And its capacity to distract itself with its own productions
Projections, explanations
That literally means to flatten out
To explain is to put on a flat surface
And we might think, well, we might reasonably think
That there is a loss of dimensionality there
Because here we are in ordinary four dimensional space time
Presuming that we decide to call time and dimension
This is a little waterfall where I've often seen hummingbirds bathing
There are aquifers underneath the garden
And the engineers and the people who built these gardens on top of sand dunes long ago
The underground aquifers produce the water that supports the life here
You will notice little areas where the water is flowing
And if you observe a place where water is flowing very closely
And follow the flow with your eyes again and again
When you look away you may find that reality is warping and distorting
And this is partly due to the visual neurons becoming
This is the right word for this
Becoming
In order to maintain your focus on the flowing water
Your visual organs and their neurological aspects
They have to modulate
And this modulation creates a sort of momentum
That when you look away from the flowing water
That modulating momentum continues for a little while
Until the organs that you see with and their neuronal elements
Adjust to the less fluid movements
Like those of leaves or branches in the breeze or even the stillness
The relative stillness of non-liquid phenomena
Water and fluid and flow are extremely important analogs and metaphors and similes
For the dreaming mind
And this is no accident
And although our cultures and societies are inclined at their broadest definition
To dismiss or belittle what happens to us at night when we dream
It's long been my experience that we've got this probably almost explicitly backwards
In fact it looks to me like we began with dreaming as children
And this is what we called imagination and play
And over time we built these structured aspects of awareness, concern
Attentional function and consciousness out of the foundations of dreaming
And we kept emphasizing and rewarding that and punishing the other thing
And of course who is we, right?
I mean the culture in general, adults, teachers, school, so on
We kept being told over and over again that imagination was relatively equivalent to nonsense
Interestingly one has to imagine that in order to assert it
Therefore something's fucking wrong with that idea
Now I am approaching the dangerous part of the park where in this moon cycle
Which will turn into a new moon cycle in two days
This part of the park which is less visited is likely to contain undiscovered and thus undestroyed wasp nests
This is actually one of my favorite parts of the garden because there are fewer people here
And most of the people I do encounter here are likely to be more peculiar
In any case, I had a series of relatively astonishing dreams
Even though there have been difficult transformations in dreaming for many of us during the unexpected changes
And challenges we've all been facing
This is a white sage plant
I just love the scent of this plant
I'm going to take a risk and walk back here
Paying very close attention to where I put my feet
And the flight paths of insects near the ground
One of the ways we can think
And there's useful ways of thinking and exploring and analogizing our relationships with consciousness
And this has just occurred to me for the first time, it's kind of peculiar
And it's probably because I've been listening to the Eric Weinstein podcast The Portal with Roger Penrose
Who is one of the true prodigies I've had the good fortune to be born during the lifetime of
How unfortunate that I have not mastered the mathematics required to understand many of his discoveries
And the book that he wrote called The Road to Reality
A book of some of the finest expositions of waking consciousness
Is staggeringly beautiful and complex
It sits on a pedestal in my room
It's the only book that sits on an actual pedestal in my room
This is the little pond where I sometimes practice the obscure art of frog sneaking
That is the ability to sneak up on a frog without it leaping off into the water
However, I am not practicing that discipline today
And in fact the pond is largely empty because it is an artificial pond
And it has not been recently filled
Nonetheless, there are frogs here
I have heard them in recent days
When I have traversed this little bridge
And when I get to the other side of it
If you hear some plopping sounds
We might be seeing some frogs
We're hearing them
Yep, there was one
There was a little bit of water left
Frog sneaking requires incredibly slow movement
You have to learn from the blue heron
The egret
The crane
How to move with otherwise unimaginable slowness
And the frogs helped me learn that
By their incredible sensitivity to movement
What I was thinking a little while ago
Was that in a way
To dream is to change the sign of consciousness
And if we call waking consciousness positive
Dreaming consciousness would be negative
I'm actually going to walk back and visit some plants
Before I dare to approach the place I survived
My yellow jacket encounter the other day
Now, in consciousness the peculiar nature of positive and negative
If we choose this analogy
Which we certainly don't have to
And it could be a bad one
It could be not fruitful enough
Not rich enough
Perhaps dreaming awareness or dreaming experience
Is the possibility of consciousness acquiring a sign
And waking experience is the result of it having done so
Glad I walked back here
Look at that feather
That's a sweet one
That's a beautiful one
Look at the color
Just gorgeous
Got lucky
I suspect it's a falcon feather
Part of why I was returning here was to see this little
Probably a cooper's hawk
Might have dropped this feather
I wanted to see some of the plants here
Like the hummingbird sage
Of which this is an old flower
Here are some really larger ones
And also this sage, this California sage brush here
There's some other hummingbird sage back there
But I wanted to see my friend
This relatively developed white sage plant
Here, these are its flowers
And many of the white sages I've been aware of
Have undergone sort of weird vivisection
By humans for various reasons
Those flowers there are fully flowering branches of white sage
And these are pre-flowers
These ones haven't flowered yet
I'm not even sure if you can hear me when I turn the camera away
So once again I now have both hands full as I did last time
When I almost got in trouble
In any case, as I was saying
Dreaming might be the possibility of signedness
And conscious waking could be
When consciousness acquires a specific sort of value
And it acquires that value
By a process I would analogize as collapsing
From potential
What we would usually refer to as ambiguity
Into derivation or disambiguation
Into structure
And while we are awake
We are mostly trapped in habits
Of structuring consciousness
According to methods
We've long enacted and come to embody
And become somewhat trapped in because
They are so compelling
They're very compelling, these methods
And
I'm approaching the scene of my last adventure
And unfortunately I don't see the
I don't see the
The owl pellet with the skull in it
That I had some modest hope of retrieving
But I do see the stump
And I do see yellow jackets
Returning
To the nest location
Not in huge numbers
Oh yeah
Yeah, there's the location, alright
Wow, I just can't imagine how I got away with that one
I can't imagine it
I have no explanation for that
Yellow jackets are profoundly unfriendly to people standing on top of their nests
They're not particularly friendly to humans in general
In any case
The habits that we acquire and use
Particularly those habits that are valuable in our
Relations with culture and work and machines and such
They are unfortunately crippling in many ways
Unless we are lucky enough to have
Or determined enough, it's not merely luck
It's also choice
Or determined enough to
Make our livings in creative endeavors
Such as music or dance or art
And there are highly structured creative endeavors too
Architecture, for example
Here's a peculiar construct
Rather dreamlike in its way
It's supposed to be
It may supposed to be
A stegosaurus
It may be supposed to be
Alright
I'm going to take a moment
And stash this feather
The habits that we are rewarded
For acquiring
It's funny, I can see yellow jackets
Heading toward the nest
Even though they're relatively infrequent
And I'd like to get up modestly close to that nest
And look around and see if the
Owl pellet that contain the strange skull
I mean most skulls are strange to me
It's still there
But I'm really nervous about it
I survived to the first time
And I don't know how
The nest would be relatively safe to approach at night time
But not so much in the daytime
And this is the location where it is
And you can see a few yellows
Oh, I think I see the pellet
Yep, I do
Oh, that's interesting
The pellet is right next to the nest now
I left it on the stump
Yeah, I'll not be retrieving that pellet
At night time, you might get away with it
Particularly if you used an implement
So as I was saying
The habits that we acquire and enact
In order to participate in culture
And particularly to have jobs
And perform relatively bizarre in-human functions
There's a lot of raptor activity around here
It's like sort of the opposite
Of watching water flowing
Which then when we look away
Leads us to see flow in all kinds of
In whatever we look at
It's the opposite of that
It's the dead structured function
Of our waking world concerns
Behaviors, habits, fears, necessities
And where that work is beautiful
Or profound, then of course it can be enriching
Unfortunately for most of us
Or many of us, large portions of our lives
Are going to be precisely the opposite of enriching
They're going to represent
Relatively cruelly enforced drudgery
That we have to do
To keep the illusion
Of properly
Properly necessary structure
And the layers of illusions
That our modern societies
Not only depend upon
But consistently reinforce
The policeman comes to think of
Herself or himself as a cop
The liquor store worker thinks of himself or herself as
You know, an employee, right?
Just now as I'm making this video
I received an email
The world of work is a vortex
And in our time
For some of us, no part of our life is safe from it
It wants to subsume everything
And this is tragic and dangerous
And this is part of what dreaming
Neals or heals or refreshes or restores
Like, you know, it's the difference between
This thing, right?
This big object of metal and structure
And absolute, notice how static it is
Wind doesn't move it
Rain does not move it
Sunlight barely changes it
Yeah
The difference between that and this
And I could talk about that difference
For days and in joyful preference to this
Because that other thing
It doesn't actually destroy our minds
It does something worse
It enslaves them
We should recognize that there are
Inclinations of the waking minds
Conceivable nature
Not necessarily it's true nature
Or it's only nature
There are properties that are supercultures
And organizations and masters
And the elite and the wealthy
And corporations and nations
And schools and prisons
They take advantage of these things
To produce slaves
And it's evil
It's the closest thing to evil
That is sort of ever presently common
For many of us who live in these circumstances
For those of us who have to obey the clock
For we who follow our smart phones
Through a living place
For purposes of distraction or necessity
Now in this moment I'm doing that
I'm making a video
But at least in this situation
I am being creative
And I'm trying to use
This is an old trope of mine
I want to use the momentum
And the elements of
That have been co-opted against us
I want to use that momentum
And those elements against the forces
That cause the collapse of our creativity
And our intelligence
And our humanity
And our structure
Our mind's disoriented
By unnecessarily cruel purposes
And deceptive, deceptively enslaving
Aspects of our adult lives
I remember the imaginative wonderland of childhood
With great enchantment and joy
And I also, like many of us anyway
We suffer the loss of that playful imaginary relationship
With reality which adults will tell us
Isn't pragmatic enough
And what they mean is
It won't help you be a slave later
One imagines the parents of birds
Who constantly peck at their wings
Because they themselves long ago
Had them pecked off by other parental birds
And so believe their children should not fly
And this is an analogy I often use
That our people and our intelligence
Our creativity, our imagination is like
It's like a bizarre species of bird
That has a myth
That causes them to celebrate crawling
And to cheer if anyone should manage to hop
But essentially to try to kill those who will fly
Or to co-opt them so that they can be profitably
You know, taken advantage of
Without actually becoming contagious enough
To get all the other birds flying again
And there's something, this analogy is
Very conservative compared to what's going on
With human consciousness and our intelligence
And such like this
The beautiful and astonishing dreaming
That I experienced last night
Which I'll not share here, it's a bit too personal
It's so refreshing, it restores
My felt sense of meaning and purpose
And oh my goodness, oh this brugamencia again
A scent, it's just redolent
This fragrance is just redolent
In the atmosphere here, there's another one here
This is the redwood
The sort of grove of redwoods in the botanical gardens
There's a peculiar kind of regal stillness and silence here
That I love
It's fascinating that
We need help, something, an insect just flew near my eye
It's also fascinating how great eyelashes are
They will protect your eye from having something fly directly into it
Because they sense and react almost instantaneously
Not quite as quickly as a praying man is a strike
Which is unimaginably fast
I think it actually, it strikes faster than your visual neurons can fire
If I remember correctly
But yeah, fast, fast enough to protect your eye most of the time
Lost my train of thought for a moment there
Because I switched tracks
I switched focuses
Oh it's funny that the dreaming mind
Sort of comes upon us when
Our nervous systems switch
To something extremely old
And our bodies become largely but not completely paralyzed
We still continue breathing for example
Some of us experience limb movement and such
And some of us actually sleepwalk
The idea that a phenomenon has a simple explicit nature
That is implied by the way we use language is wrong
It's just boldly wrong
And it's unfortunate that we would ever use language in this way
Because it misleads us into thinking about identity
In ways that are catastrophically delusional
Phenomenon that have the same name are often similar
But that similarity is
Falsified
The more we move toward the specific
Circumstances of a given organism or situation or perceiver
And then it becomes, things become very unique
All dreams can be said to be dreams
But there are many many different kinds of dreaming
And many astonishingly unique modes and forms of dreaming
The hypnagogic dreams on the way to sleep differ dramatically
From the hypnopompic dreams on the way to awakening
Which also differ from the deep dreaming that happens somewhere in between them
I'm hoping to see, here's a
Here's a pipeline swallowtail
Caterpillar
And here's another one
And I think I see some yellow jackets
Did I have a nest down there?
Saw a couple of them floating down there
Could be a nest right nearby here
I'm hoping to see a few pipeline swallowtail caterpillars
And I'm curious if I will see a
A chrysalis over here
Yep
Okay, so the other day
When I was here I showed the caterpillar
That was preparing to make this chrysalis
And there it is
And up here is the skin
Of a previous attempt at chrysalization
That skin often happens
Is often found at the top of the chrysalis
And here's another chrysalis underneath here
And here is an evacuated chrysalis
Right there
Perhaps dreaming is like the chrysalization of consciousness
Or falling asleep is like the chrysalization of consciousness
And dreaming is the butterfly that there from emerges
Now most people who know me know I'm really fascinated by dreaming
And people will think, well, what about lucid dreaming?
That's the partial intrusion of waking consciousness
Into what I might think is the manifold of the dreaming experience
Without causing that manifold to collapse into waking
And lucid dreaming is certainly fascinating
And has many peculiar avenues that we can explore
Many peculiar branches
But I'm sort of more fascinated by something less commonly discussed
Which is the opposite situation
The gentle introduction of the dreaming mind
Into the manifold of waking consciousness
Without it just collapsing into a dream
And this is one of the features, one of the possibilities
That make psychedelic drugs so attractive
But I prefer experiences that don't require that
That don't require intoxication
That do not force us into a non-ordinary consciousness
By the introduction of medicines or poisons
Though many, many people sing the praises of these drugs
I am not one of them
And the reason I am not one of them
Is that I've had experiences that so dramatically
That so dramatically transformed my waking consciousness continuously
Without the introduction of intoxicants
That those experiences of psychedelia that I've had
Seem relatively trivial and misleading in comparison
So I don't want people to get to associate the wrong door
With these experiences
And that's a subtopic
To wander in the garden
Is to be relieved of the visual, structured fictions and toxicity
Of all those machines and buildings outside this little sanctuary
And if I could, I'd spend most of my time
Nearly all of it
With living places and living beings
Learning from them and loving them
And having relationships with them
But I live in a box in a city
And I speak to you now through a rectangle in my hand
A rectangle whose propagation has become more than a mere pandemic
People who are lives in minds now serve
In relatively tragic and cruel ways
But I am lucky enough to have been born
In a time when the oceans were yet unspoiled
When Africa was still a thriving,
Anciently conserved array of ecological places and relationships
Where the Amazon was mostly undisturbed
That era is gone
The oceans are dying
The Amazon is gone
The rainforests in New Zealand gone
Africa has been obliterated
The few remaining megafauna are being poached to extinction
While we speak
Even though there are brave people
Like a man named Damien
Fighting to protect them
And many others, not just him
They won't succeed, unfortunately
And they know it
But for the moment, I still live on a world
Where there are trees and plants and birds and insects
And yellow jackets and hawks and owls
Raccoons and cougars
Coyotes
Magnolias
And people interested in recovering
Some of the astonishing
Faculties and assets that underlie our capacity
For human awareness, consciousness,
Relation and wonder
I have high hopes, but I'm a pessimist
I'm a hopeful pessimist
I expect apocalypse and work for utopian ideas
Not human utopias, but perhaps
Perhaps what I might more reasonably call
Perotopias, or protopias
The possibility of our return
From our long delusional waking nightmare
To something resembling
That both takes advantage
Of the progress we've made
Intellectually and philosophically
And scientifically and mathematically
Though science is very, very dangerous
For us right now
As powerful and as necessary as it is
Our societies are not intelligent enough
To relate survivably with the produce
That science gives them
And our war machines
And our industries
And our machines in general
Are evidence of this assertion
Though I respect the scientific method
I'm terrified of what the humans will do
With the results, what they do
It's not will do, and what they will do
But I still am hopeful
Of the possibility of a future
In which humans in nature
Return to an enlightened union
And this is why I take the time
To explore some of the fundamental aspects
Of our confusion
And where we might find inspiration, insight
Discovery and hope
And one of those places is dreaming
May we learn to dream again together
And to follow those dreams
Into roles and relationships and societies
That are worthy of the noblest
Conservations that comprise the human experience
Thank you for joining me
May you be safe, well, and filled with learning
Bye bye for now
