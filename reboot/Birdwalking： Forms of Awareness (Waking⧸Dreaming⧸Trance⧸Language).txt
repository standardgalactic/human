today i'm just going to birdwalk a bit
which is a word that we use to indicate traversing a variety
of possibly unrelated threads or a seemingly disorganized
journey through a variety of ideas
and so i thought it might be useful to begin with some images of the white jaws
there's one of these animals today
that's probably a male and it's separated from most of the other animals
they're pretty spread out at the moment which is kind of unusual
but this one in the far west as the sun is beginning to set
that is clearly vigilant and perhaps is experiencing something analogous to trance
now when i use the word trance i'm speaking of something i'm speaking of a general class of
phenomenon in consciousness or what humans refer to as states of consciousness yet
this is not a particularly apt idea and is much like attempting to talk about states of water
which again isn't impossible or useless
but what you have with water and with things that are flowing
aren't exactly states states imply stasis
and what you have i think with both consciousness and water
are phenomena that that resemble
i've got to think carefully for a good word here
phenomena that resemble
modes of flow
and when we think about waking consciousness there are myriads of modes of flow
the same is true of dreaming consciousness we think dreaming always refers to the same
thing this is a mistake when we think this way because it doesn't there are a vast array
of kinds of dreaming if we want to examine
the unique forms within the general class the same is true of trance
the same is true of waking consciousness the the form of consciousness used when performing
a math problem is not the same form of consciousness
that appreciates for example the the fabulous beauty
of this organism and its surrounding
symbiotically related organisms and the sky and so on
and that's a different kind of waking consciousness from the type that i'm using now
to organize and produce vocalizations in english
one might even argue that although when we are making language we're using a very similar
kind of consciousness there are a vast array of different kinds of available consciousness within
the language making kinds yeah so that i have experienced forms of language making where
as if i were possessed by something beautiful
poetics i could never write emerged spontaneously from me and were were i to attempt to record those
that would change the situation and it would be much more difficult if not impossible
even if i succeeded it would not be the same thing that would have happened
had i not attempted to record them and i suspect as a poet that this kind of possessed
impassioned mind that i've very occasionally experienced and wondered at
may have been much more common to our ancestors who had no writing
and maybe the origin of poetry and song when we are writing songs
there's a vast array of different aspects or modes of the transformation of consciousness
that we might experience some of these can be very kind of technical
unthinky but others of them are trance like emotional beautiful and i think we revere
musicians and songwriters because they not only
are presenting evidence of having been in this
mind in this form of awareness this this mode of awareness they're also
creating an artifact recording usually unless we're seeing something live
that draws us into an experience of
trance like wonder or impassioned emotion
and these are things we may too infrequently experience in life
there's a hawk
the hawk
the hawk is hunting worms because the ground is very moist
no not because it turns out that the ground is very moist at the moment
and that makes it easy for the hawk to hunt
and eat the worms this is not a particularly common
thing to see
it often happens in the winter
it's a very large hawk
probably a red tail although it could be its tail doesn't look particularly red
it could be another kind perhaps a cooper's hawk it's very large
i'm just going to watch it for a few moments
it's not that easy to show it
because with the video i cannot turn the camera around while i'm making a video
maybe you got to see it fly i cannot see what i'm pointing the camera at when i'm turning my phone away from me
so one of the reasons we love music is that it transforms our consciousness
particularly when we resonate with it
and although i am from an older generation a generation born in the 60s
and through the 60s and 70s what we referred to as popular music
was vastly more sophisticated emotionally prosaically melodically lyrically
than most of what qualifies as popular music today
i suspect that my grandparents my parents and grandparents would argue something similar
about the music that was quote popular there's this kind of a funny
pun in that word we're not really a pun some implications
phonetic implications um in their time yeah they would they would have said well our music was
much more sophisticated and rich in in in certain dimensions that they would have argued the music of the 60s and 70s was not
it's very complicated what happens in modern cultures because
over time our people became in groups and supergroups highly motivated to sell things
this was not always the case although attention human the attention of human beings to to to acquire that attention
was always valuable in some way but it wasn't always
so expressly commodified yeah it wasn't always so controlled dominated by money
which is a representation of value and for some reason i find this particular image
very apt
the entrance is barred by steel
one cannot come and go freely here one has to either belong here
according to some groups assertions or purchase their way in
so as as human consciousness became a target for marketers the
depth and richness of our lives has been profoundly compromised and embedded in contexts that are really toxic
um
particularly the context the contextual agents
that marketers and advertisers comprise
the primary purpose for which we are studied by corporations
is to attract our attention to learn how to garner our attention and to transform that
attention into the commodity of cash now i would argue that in the 60s and 70s particularly
there was a profound kind of renaissance of incredible creativity and poetics in popular music
this isn't to say that there were that the poetics was missing before that
rather it had different forms and pivots around which it orbited
the commodification of music and art
it seems to me a tragic result of our
consistently accelerating march into modernity
there are however secret hidden makers and beauties that never get sold
right art that is rarely seen private things personal things songs that are never recorded
many of the most beautiful things that have ever emerged from my mouth in terms of poetry
there is no record of and in many cases there was no ostensible audience other than being itself
or the universe or something like this
perhaps some of the most beautiful and intelligent things that have ever been done by human beings
left no trace for the marketers to appropriate
and this to me seems appropriate because the most beautiful aspects of our humanity
and our intelligence are like small children sometimes will will be very shy
they know there's a world that will turn them into commodities and objects and
and artifacts abstractions they know there's a world that is hungry to consume the essence
and to kill in a way the beauty and the intelligence of our humanity
and this to me seems largely the result of the commodification systems that have unfortunately
dominated our culture they are purveyors of representations of value
and on the one hand we might argue there's nothing but representations
and this is a not unuseful argument to explore on the other we might argue or assert that
all these representations are the dead sort of shells
of something essentially not merely alive but more than alive the origin of being the the pulse
of the origin of being and all these things we make in our supercultures
and even in our work and jobs and the things we consume and purchase our cars our clothing our
homes if we have them if we are if we are quote lucky enough to have such things
and certainly those of us who live in the west are much more likely to be quote lucky in this way
that we will have a box within which we may be maybe capable of feeling relatively safe for the
moment and a car with which we may be able to travel to other places and clothing and computers
and smartphones and all of the accoutrement of modernity
we have taken on the shells of
our cultures not unlike not entirely unlike hermit crabs except that
the shells they acquire generally once we're living and the shells we acquire
are almost of course our houses were once mostly living trees that's important
but most of the things we make
are comprised of elements that are i don't know how to put it not particularly
not merely the remains of living things but living things had to die to produce and extract and
create and shape and transport and sell them so this is fairly grim
but to return to circle back to you to where i began there are many different kinds
of conscious phenomenon and when we speak of being awake or dreaming or being in trance
we're not talking about one thing although we may believe we are because language is deceptive
in this way it allows us to encompass a range of phenomenon give it a name and then believe
that we have a grasp upon it this is deceptive we should resist that
that sense we should resist that feeling we should become aware of it and resist it because
the profound diversity of our experience is excused and hidden away
by habits in language that very few of us will ever have the opportunity to become aware of
and therefore very few of us will ever have the opportunity
to evade or escape i would like for all of us to have this opportunity i want more of us
to have the ability to understand some of the dangers and traps implicit in what i refer to as
formally representational cognition which is the kind we are given as children we
when someone might say we inherit it another might say we are infected with it
someone else might say it is foisted upon us or forced upon us some might use more violent language
um we believe it to be a gift to teach children
the we do two things most of us will do two things with our children
and we're relatively forced to do these things in our cultures
the first is to inculturate them to introduce them to the various branches of cultural identity
and meaning and activity that are prevalent in the time they are born
um it wasn't very long ago that you would never see an infant or a small child
with a computer in their hand looking into their hand unless they were marveling
at the astonishing beauty and sophistication of this very profound appendage
of course it's not very long ago at all that no adults
were interacting with computational technology this is a really new thing
and it's become astonishingly pervasive
and i would argue it's a trans induction phenomenon the reason that i would argue this is
well there are many reasons but i resisted having this technology for a long time as someone
who watched the transformations that the introduction of computers and email and then
cell phones and then smartphones produced in in human beings and human relationships
as someone who studied this phenomenon very closely and carefully
i was extremely suspicious of this technology and i remain i remain thus
but i would argue that it's a trans inducing technology and one of the reasons i would
suggest this though this is not merely what it is it is not merely that
uh as i remember the first time i brought my my iphone out into the world with me
and i paused to look at something on the internet on my phone
and as i did that because i am unaccustomed to it i was shocked
i the world disappeared my memory of myself disappeared
my consciousness changed so dramatically in an instant from a single seemingly modest behavior
that i was absolutely staggered and i realized that the things i had been observing in other people
the things i'd been concerned about in what i'd seen in other people's behavior with these objects
was not only
let's just say my concerns could not have encompassed the intensity of the transformation
in consciousness i experienced when i took out my smartphone and looked up something on
a news site
and i was completely blown away at the intensity of that immediate transformation
and it validated what i was concerned about that this technology is profoundly dangerous
and yet though it is dangerous
it allows me to create something a record an artifact
in which we can explore these dangers
and think about them together and perhaps learn to deal more intelligently
with aspects of our modern situation that are lethally dangerous
i believe it was in greek
that it was proposed metaphysically
in a parable or in a parabolic analogy
that at death or at least before birth we are dipped in the waters of the river lethe
l-e-t-h-e
and this is the river of forgetting it washes away the memory of previous lives and existences
and experiences
and much of our modern environment socially, technologically, relationally, vocationally
is lethal in this sense that it causes forgetting
and the arts of memory that once existed and flourished prior to the existence of writing
while not entirely lost, have been transformed
and now we are in danger, i think real danger, of suffering a sort of second catastrophic
evisceration of the organs of human memory
as we become more dependent on the internet to know and
i can't even believe i said that
first of all the internet doesn't know anything
to store
to store codes to store encodings
that we are willing to think of as equivalent with knowledge which they can never be
machines have not the capacity to know only living beings and places can know
i reserve this word knowledge for living beings and places and times and situations and relationships
i similarly reserve the word intelligence for something very similar
intelligence is not a quality i am willing to associate with objects
object forks and stuff don't have intelligence, photographs don't have intelligence
photographs are not memory, wikipedia is not knowledge
knowledge is something that happens in human minds
and there's an interesting feature of this word
to know the ledge no ledge knowledge right to know the edge to get as close as you can
to direct experience and understanding using memory
and we call the place
we travel through
to change our location we call it an entrance
and it's very clear that our ancestors used trance or something we would call this though
they did not to travel and they used water trees phenomenon in the sky
holes in trees or water or the earth
as beginning places the same way we might use a door or a gate
there are many forms of trance
and some of them represent forms of intelligence our people have forgotten
not all of them require hypnosis trance is something familiar to everyone
as i mentioned unfortunately when people pay really close attention to their
handheld devices they're entering a trance with machines
and i would argue that this is lethal because they're losing contact with their surroundings and their environment and the living music and signals that could draw them into other forms of consciousness far more profound than anything they can ever encounter through the window of these light emitting devices
so there are many kinds of trance and there are many kinds of dreaming and there are many aspects of waking awareness not one these words are deceptive in that we think a single word encompasses all the phenomenon it cannot
it shouldn't we should resist that
most of us are trained in a very broken relationship with language and meaning and identity
and one of the people who i think is brilliant and profound and also very difficult to understand who can teach us about this is one of the people who i think is brilliant and profound and also very difficult to understand
and he was a man named alfred korzybski and alfred korzybski and i think the thirties or forties he wrote a number of books but in the thirties or forties he wrote a book called science and sanity which i first encountered when i was 17 and i encountered it because of the work of a
of a science fiction writer a evan bow
in science and sanity alfred korzybski invites us to explore features of language and thought that are lethal and to and by so doing to learn to escape them and i'm just i'm not going to talk too much about him today
but i am going to speak in a moment about a few specific pivots of his teaching but first i'd like you to see these don redwood trunks
these are the trunks of trees that were damaged by the fall of this tree here last year and these incredible organisms are the prehistoric ancestors of redwoods
these are deciduous redwoods
their scientific latinate name is really fun to say
i'm hoping that these trees haven't been killed i think they have not
i think we will i will discover in the springtime what happens we will see what happens
but their latinate name is metasequia gliptoe stroboides
and these were believed to be extinct until sometime i think in the 1800s when a single living specimen was discovered
alongside a temple in china if i remember the story correctly the narrative
discovered that's funny really it was there the whole time i mean
and there may be others that have not yet been discovered but
biologists believed that the species was extinct because it was only known from fossils until this living tree was discovered and all of the trees that we know of
all of the living specimens of this tree come from that one tree
korshibski one of one of the important things that he asks us to question is the is of identity
that is a dream that is a tree that is a frog
those are people these are ducks
and what korshibski wants us to understand is that this is is a is a lethal convenience
it causes us to forget that the actual nature of identity is infinitely deep
there's no way to properly encompass it he's famous for a cliche that the map is not the territory by which we are
the representation and the thing toward which it points are staggeringly different
the word duck is nothing like a duck it has almost nothing to do with the phenomenon toward which it points
and the congruencies between the word and the concept
right because duck is an idea that will have different meanings in different situations even though it's a word
there's very little congruence between the pointer and the thing toward which it points the thing toward which it points might as well be a doorway to the entire universe it's infinitely rich in qualities it has no end of qualities
if we started accounting them we'd never finish even if everyone did it all at once we'd never get done because anything
is really anything we might imagine or look at or separate in consciousness anything we might distinguish in language or conception or modeling
if we go to the thing that we are doing this to or with we will discover that it leads to everything
and everything is transfinite in multiple ways it's not singularly transfinite it's endlessly multiply transfinite
so Korzybski asks us to remain aware that the is of identity is misleading whatever a thing might be
it isn't what we think it is and it certainly isn't what we call it and it isn't our model of it and it isn't the species and it isn't the kind it isn't the genus
these are all toys we've created in a representational layer on top of our awareness that we've learned to transmit to each other generation to generation we keep transmitting this layer of ideation models methods categories and so on
once upon a time those may have been useful and powerful they're still powerful those may have once been much more useful than than they are today we may discover in time that we need to shed this representational layer in order to make a space for something far more provocative and astonishing
which as yet most of us are incapable of even imagining and i would suggest that this is likely
and i would suggest that our ancestors were also aware
ancient peoples were aware of the incredible dangers of representational thought
so that they kept that stuff away from ceremonial and ritual activity
they kept that stuff away from it in the same way surgeons want to keep bacteria and germs out of the operating theater they recognized that representational thought however useful it may be
is lethally dangerous to an aspect of ourselves that is essential that is non-linguistic that is beyond language
that is related to song and also to trance
to enter a place we go through the entrance
this is not an accident and there are many similar non-accidental hints throughout our language
about things that were once deeply understood have now been forgotten
and what we have are sort of the fossilized remains of understanding in our languages
and our habitual ways of referring to things conceptually and linguistically
so Korzybski wanted us to deeply question the is of identity and to notice that we are creatures who do this thing he calls time-binding which is to transfer the representational layer and habits and methods and handicaps
that our existing cultures preserve and embellish we transfer these to our children
and all of us underwent this process and that is why you're able to understand the face noises i am making in the language we call english
now if we remain aware that the things we refer to are not the names and ideas and concepts and models
we have a very different form of intelligence if i know that i can say the word tree
but that's just a pointer to something infinitely profound
a little bit of the lethal
effect of representational cognition
fades away and the more that i become aware that what i call things and how i think of things
is very different from those things themselves it gives me the option to touch the things themselves with my awareness in a way that dismisses my knowledge
my representational knowledge and in that we have the opportunity to experience something like the opposite of the river lethe
the river of remembering to remember to draw into organismal union communion to remember to become remembered of
and to remember ourselves and our nature and the universe and time space
and origin and being and love and essence and wonder and ecstasy
these are things so rare in our time
that many many people will never know their natural sources and instead will have to purchase them or purchase analogs of them
they will buy commodities that will represent those essential aspects of our human nature and capacity
instead of touching and being remembered and remembering them together
in their moment to moment experience without recourse to drugs or electronics or
the commodities that stand between us and these things
i know the word tree but when i see the living being
it refers to that being is infinitely hyperconnective with all of time space
there is not really anything left out
i can perceive it as a distinct organism in an ecology but
so there's a fundamental aspect of our awareness and particularly our representational consciousness
that's so crucial that if we transform its meaning or if we just flip the polarity
everything in our experience changes and that fundamental aspect is the dichotomy
which should not be a dichotomy we should
there should be a kind
i'm in a i've made a little trap for myself accidentally here
because i don't wish to present this as a dichotomy and i'm not yet sure in the moment
how not to do that or how to do something other than that but it's the dichotomy between distinctness and unity
and if our awareness is oriented such that unity has precedence
then the idea of distinctness is merely something we can play with
but the polarity for most of us is set during the process of our being enculturated and
language as children the polarity is set on the other side it's set on separation it's set on distinction
so that we think of things right we think of the tree as a distinct thing being object idea when in fact
in the consciousness of unity
it is an expression of all it's a unique it's an entrance right it's an entrance to everything
and anything that we might distinguish is thus from the perspective of unity
all things are expressions of a fundamental
fundamental
fundamental
relationship no it's so hard to put this in language worse i'm so used to the language of
distinction we don't really have good language about unity that we have words you know like
community and things like this and communion from the perspective of unity
all things are local expressions of the nature of origin being translocal identity relational
intelligence communion exchange symbiosis so that fundamentally what you have on earth
of course it doesn't end at the edges of the earth it's all of time space
and even beyond that to things we have no no concept for yet but essentially earth is one organism
one first first everything is one
then it's possible to think of things as being distinct but we should understand why we're doing
that why we're choosing that and we should have volitional the volitional ability to move back
to the perception of unity not just the idea of it the almost electrical power of the direct
perception of unity and when we have these experiences the result is unlike anything you
can imagine it's a form of intelligence that our people must have once had that probably our
representational cultures were born for or excuse me from but then we're quickly overpowered by it
and the same thing happened to us as children the same story the story of the fall the story of
adam and eve eating from the tree of knowledge right these are stories of something that happened
to each of us in childhood we started out with the mind of unity i suggest and i suggest this
because i have memories of it not because it's a theory that i like um so we started out with
this mind of unity and we were trained to use an aspect of our imagination to make cuts in that
unity to distinguish yeah and notice the likeness between this word distinguish and a word that
we're all familiar with extinguish to make the light go away to make the heat the warmth go away
to extinguish so there was something alive in which we participated at birth that was so intelligent
that it had the power to acquire the representational overlay from any culture we might land in
even the culture of dogs right um even a culture of of another intelligence from another world
we have the capacity inherently to acquire that representational overlay but the aspect of our
imaginations and minds that have this ability are usually essentially killed by it they are
extinguished now it doesn't mean that they go away entirely part of how we understand meaning
depends on the survival of at least a small aspect of this essential pre-linguistic intelligence
this pre-linguistic awareness
and many of us suffer because although we've preserved some degree of it so that we can at
least understand language and respond to statements and such the degree differs in each human
being and it differs in each context and contexts transform that degree situations relationships and
so on they they change this degree to which we are able to experience meaning and not just have a
thought a thinky thing um a sort of computational like thing that tells us that round indicates a
circular you know some quality right we can ascertain qualities and understand qualities
implied by language but meaning is a different thing meaning is something it's a felt sense
it's like your heart right so so i'm i'm suggesting that when we were children
first of all i think we were entranced constantly and part of this trance is what we call play
and people say like you know will you grow out of that no i don't think that's what happened
i don't think we ever grow out of that what happens instead is something very tragic
it gets buried it gets extinguished and it gets extinguished by our encounter with that
representational layer of consciousness of awareness which doesn't have to have that quality
that's not the only way we can play this game that's very profound to us as humans oh this is
astonishing i'm going to interrupt
for a moment of just participation even if only through an image in this phenomenon
the humans might classify this as a decomposer
but it's far more profound and in fact as i said it's an entrance
this is a way of entering everything by just relating with it directly
yeah
it's funny i have the urge to take a photograph
even though i've recorded this i have the urge to take i do i can help you
if you travel either in that direction and go past those palm trees you'll come to it
or if you go in that direction you'll come to the entrance you came into where i first saw you
sure thing
they wanted to know where the exit is
and what i would like for us to discover together is where's the exit to representational
intelligence because somewhere near that exit hovers that essential awareness that we had as
children right that was so profound that it endowed us with the capacity to acquire a
representational overlay and that overlay eventually essentially extinguished the thing
we acquired it with although it left remnants and those are what we refer to when we these days talk
about our imagination because that's the place actually memory what we call memory is a feature
of imagination without an imagination you can't have memory it's not storage right so today we've
been exploring ideas related in my birdwalk if you will we've been exploring ideas related
to the different aspects of consciousness that we are familiar with from our common human
experience waking dreaming trance and yet um those divisions aren't real those divisions are
convenience of language right what's real is the actual quality of experience that our awareness
brings forth um that we become in a sense right it's not we we don't just experience consciousness
we become different kinds of flow in awareness and one of the best metaphors for this but the
metaphor is incomplete at best is is water or liquid or atmosphere when i see the the flowing swirls
on the surface of photographs or films of jupiter
i imagine that a mind is not entirely dissimilar that somehow this resembles the activities of a
mind or of awareness and i want us to resurrect the pre-linguistic imagination of our childhood
that's represented in the bible as abel who is killed by kane and now is sort of vanished to the
underworld which we might imagine to be the the dimension of dreaming
i'm so excited to be able to even have the opportunity to speak of these things
how rare it is to be born human but how much rarer it is to be able to understand
and see through that representational overlay back in time towards its origins
and some living peoples still both peoples indigenous peoples and such and some individuals
are gifted but how can they possibly those gifted individuals are going to have a terrifying struggle
because they're going to have to find a way to survive having preserved
some aspect of the intelligence with which we acquire the representational overlay
in a culture that effectively despises it and turns it into stuff right makes things that you
can sell out of it so they might be born a brilliant musician or an artist or a dancer or a poet
or an orator or an actor or or something we don't even have a name for
and the culture is going to want around them it's going to first attack them probably
although some of them will be immediately celebrated which might be just as dangerous
because the thing that killed the originary mind is the thing that's celebrating your fame
when you're famous so just be aware of that right that thing is not necessarily your friend and
if your if the power of your imagination and your preservation of communion is significant enough
it will awaken the assassin in culture and the assassin will come for you right we have lots
of stories about this whether or not jesus actually happened jesus is a story about this
martin luther king is a guy we actually know he lived he's real this is a story about this right
if you pose enough of a threat to the existing representational culture monster or monsters
or however you want to think of it they'll come for you right they'll send the assassin or they'll
produce an assassin john lennon is another example we can there are there are many
there are countless women whose names we don't even remember
who were just obliterated because they embodied this originary consciousness awareness
intelligence and some of those women were called witches but it doesn't matter what they were called
they were assassinated right and they were subjected to torture and so on and so forth
you know one might argue that john f kennedy a man who at least envisioned
the end of prisons and a man who wasn't perfect and i'm not claiming he was you know messianic
necessarily or anything but he was one of the most intelligent and insightful presidents now now
there you've got a real problem because you've got the leader of the structured fiction we call our
society seeing through that society that's really dangerous and right now what we have
is the opposite of that yeah in america anyway we've got the direct opposite of that right we've
got a leader who actually embodies the lethal forgetting that our supercultures represent and
the pinnacle of commodification right commodity overtakes value entirely right and overtakes meaning
and intelligence and humanity and everything right and truth suddenly doesn't exist the truthfulness
doesn't exist truth itself is a very very sophisticated and subtle thing but truthfulness
doesn't exist anymore in in this in the current presidential context in the united states
the light the rhythm of the patterns of light on water at sunrise or sunset
is one of the most primordial and essential examples
of the entrance to everything
i am so very grateful to have been able to have this time to share with you and learn together
and to reflect on these things in my little birdwalk and i began with no real idea of where
i was going so we don't always have to have a plan to make something meaningful or beautiful
and hopefully i've awakened and reminded
something essential in you
and maybe you will return the favor
in dreaming in trance in communion in relationship
bye bye for now thank you so much for joining me
you
