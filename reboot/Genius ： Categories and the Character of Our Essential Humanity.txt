Hello everybody. So I found a place where there's not too many people and I was
drawn here by a woodpecker that was making a sound and just incredible sound
and it's not the first time that an animal has alerted me to something right
that paying attention to signals from nature has allowed me to discover
something that's very important to me or new. But what I began thinking about
was the idea that a woodpecker led me here and how we as humans we have this
this relationship with categories and instances in our language that much of
the time makes us dumb because we will think oh what is that oh it's a it's an
animal oh it's a bird oh it's a woodpecker and we end there and we think
we we think thereby that we've understood the phenomenon when that's not
possible and that way of relating with categories is part of what has damaged
our capacities for intelligent humanity. We believe that our categories are good
and true and relatively complete. I'm here to tell you they're terrible they're
the kind of categories you'd use to classify things but not to relate with
them and we've forgotten an incredibly important fact that when we make
distinctions when we determine the category that some phenomenon belongs
to and you know what the instance is for example you know it's it's something
it's an animal it's a bird it's a woodpecker and then usually we're done
when we do that we're changing the structure of our intelligence in a way
that leads to catastrophic errors. We don't we don't realize that as we make
distinctions in phenomenon we're changing the underlying structure our minds
are capable of expressing and experiencing and this is a catastrophically
important discovery right to to recognize this changes your relationship with
the possibilities of your own intelligence forever and there were
brilliant men and women and many children throughout history in fact
children tend to suspect these problems when they're very small they they can
tell the adults are playing a really weird game with language and categories
that doesn't look right to the children and many of the children will even talk
to each other about this and and ask you know make make bonds and say like if I
ever start doing that weird thing the adults are doing with language and
knowledge stop me or you know help me or fix me or rescue me right but there were
many brilliant men and women throughout history who recognized that our
relationships with categories language and knowledge are fundamentally broken
and they're broken in such a way that's going to continue to make us dumber
every time we use them until we learn or rediscover or invent something better
and one of the reasons we're not doing that is that the contexts that we're
immersed in the contexts from which we derive our understandings of value and
meaning and reward and punishment and so on these contexts are unimaginably
inhibitive and in the beginning most of us rebel against that when we're very
young but eventually over time the vast majority of us we break down under
constant pressure from peers and you know people we work with and authorities
and cultural forces and so on most of us eventually break down some of us don't
right and some of us who have lived who are brilliant geniuses I'm gonna come
back to that word in just a moment people like I don't know everyone there
are different kinds of genius right so there are artistic geniuses like Frida
Kahlo or Leonora Carrington or Leonardo da Vinci or you know brilliant vocalists
or dancers there are the woodpecker the woodpecker it's calling again there are
scientific geniuses like Einstein and Bohr there are mathematical geniuses like
Kurt GÃ¶del and John Nash by the way as I'm in a relatively new physical context
I'm gonna be paying attention somewhat to the ground because there are dangers
here I'm not used to avoiding you can hear the woodpecker that is the being
that called my attention to this area where there are not very many people so
there's different kinds of expression of genius and because I'm using language
and I'm talking about categories I'm gonna talk briefly about one of the ways
to understand what I'm referring to when I use this word genius the common
understanding of the word genius is a quality of unusual unusually prodigious
insight wisdom skill articulation understanding behavior so on and so forth
right like someone or a group of people a team that are so far beyond what we you
know what we're used to what we consider ordinary that they stand out and this is
part of why we call actors who become very famous stars a very interesting
phenomenon since what those people are actually engaged in generally speaking
is either a form of trance in which they attempt to become another person that
they're not usually or mimicry right extremely advanced mimicry skills and
mimicry plays a crucial role in a variety of the topics and constellations of
topics that I'd like to touch on here even though to be very honest with you
I'm improvising and this is my second attempt at this improvisation since
the first one was unfortunately lost so let me talk a little bit about this
perspective on genius our ordinary understanding is it's something like
extra skill right it's it's peculiarly extra skillful but there's an older
understanding that probably comes from like the Greeks maybe or possibly even
before their time and it's weird that we would do we would even use language like
this this language is weird I'm referring to an ethnicity in order to
indicate a time and what do I mean by that time I mean really like the time
of Socrates and his philosophical and intellectual ancestors and progeny
right so sometime back then genius was understood very differently and it was
something like this in a superposition over your human life there is either an
aspect of yourself or a distinct intelligence right a being that is in
intelligence that longs to both connect with you to be connected to you and to
be expressed into human culture through your own development growth activity
behavior vocation creativity and so on and so people like Einstein or who knows
you know Helen of Troy I don't know these people let me just think for a
moment it's funny my name memory is not is not really up to its ordinary
sophistication at the moment
I'll have to let that be as it is in any case many people we are each familiar
with throughout history have expressed and experienced the indwelling in their
life and minds and hearts and creativity of what we might refer to as their
genius and sometimes it was the case that they wanted to make something
beautiful some kind of creative act of art or dance or painting or sculpture or
writing
Madeline Ingalls stories come to mind because they were so they had such a
foundational effect on me as did the stories of many other science fiction
authors and authorises but there were other people who wanted to advance human
knowledge the first person who suggested for example that the heart pumped
blood was summarily exiled from the medical establishment everyone said no
one can feel the heart pumping blood there's no such thing you can't it's not
a pump it's a heater so on and so forth right so initially we get ideas about
the category and instance of some phenomenon and eventually someone comes
along and says no the heart is not a heater it pumps blood now the heart is
not a pump whatever the heart might be it can't be a pump right a pump is a
machine that humans have derived from watching natural processes so whatever a
heart might be it's got to be something vastly more sophisticated with tons of
different things that it does it can't be a pump and you know computers are not
mines our ability to build computers is a natural derivation of certain aspects of
our cognitive function but computers will never be intelligent intelligence is a
property is a quality proper to living beings and places right it's not a
quality that objects can events it doesn't fit inside objects right whatever
apparent intelligence might come from computation is the result of humans
having codified a structured mimicry of the functions of minds that are
intelligent and then having made the mistake of thinking that they could
subtract themselves and their own influence from that constellation of you
know behaviors and functions and pretend that magically the intelligence has now
been transferred in time into a machine will never happen wrong it's a category
error right so we have lots of problems like this in our relationship with
knowledge and the categories that we presently presume to be useful and good
I mean like I said like I said about the the woodpecker right there's
something there's an animal it's a bird it's a woodpecker yeah now of course we
could use the the the Latin biological constructs that include things like
genus and species and phylum and class and so on and so forth I'm sure I got
those in the wrong order but but again that's just a classification system that
doesn't tell us what the nature of the phenomenon is the way that it pretends to
when we use these when we enact these behaviors that distinguish specific
elements of our experience when we're doing that we're changing the fundamental
under structure of our minds which we are determining what kinds of futures are
possible for that intelligence and which ones are no longer possible generally
speaking not absolutely except that we've learned to do this so emphatically that
what we call knowledge rather than revealing the nature of all that is to us and inviting us
into participation with it it does the opposite and this is what we call education today this
is what we've been calling education for a long long time now occasionally some particularly
inspired or insightful human being will come along and say something's wrong with what the
humans are thinking how they are thinking about something like for example gravity or light
or time. Einstein is an example that comes easily to hand because the corrections that
single individual who by the way needed the work of a vast constellation of people all throughout
time he was not singularly responsible for that with which we credit him right and this is another
error we pretend that the aspect of us that participates in culture and cultures of popularity
and fame and so on and so forth we presume and pretend that exemplars of prodigy are standing
on their own right it never happened even one time I certainly can't stand on my own exemplars of
prodigy emerge within concentric constellations of discovery disclosure
description modeling assertion argument over vast periods of human time so that when Einstein
finally climbed up out of the collective muck of the nonsense then prevalent much like Darwin or
or who knows Joan of Arc um they're they're most since men write the books we know the names of men
I know I know the names of men much much more easily the the women are alive in my heart
and my psyche and have been my teachers um but just like just about everybody
I'm relatively trained to remember the men and they come more easily to mind at the moment so
maya culpa maya maxima culpa um just understand I have I also have the women in
mind because it's not merely men that are prodigies um and I've been trying to remember the names of a
few specific women who had a profound influence on me I've mentioned some some of the artists names
but even some of those are escaping me and part of it is because I'm using I'm doing the thing I
was talking about right I'm using my mind in a specific array of ways for a specific array of
purposes and that doesn't necessarily enhance my
the library of names that I carry in my heart and my access to it in this moment
so I want to go back to this idea of genius right um we moderns use genius as a property
I think genius generally referred to a being and most of us have some degree of experience
of this thirst or this hunger this hidden secret thing within us that aches to be acknowledged
and expressed and historically the people who've been capable of expressing it it's not just
success that they experience right there's all kinds of it can be absolutely catastrophic
for a person's life to have that contact with genius and have it express itself into their
academic or vocational or creative or relational context right there's all kinds of stories of
tragedy the monelly the mother and daughter you know lies in monelly and her mother
are our examples that come quickly to mind but there's all kinds of catastrophes that happen
and I think the Greeks were aware that the proximity of one's genius is both
an incredible astonishing opportunity to recognize and embody the deepest most profound
potentials of our human interiority and ability while at the same time being a razor walk between
you know catastrophe and success and in this case catastrophe is often shockingly significant
many people who became wildly famous had terrible lives similarly people who
uh experienced profound financial success had catastrophically bad lives although
money can in some ways protect you know it can act in a protective way against some of the forces
that might otherwise obliterate your your humanity or your life but my point is that
we all each one of us and our cultures have a role to play here because when our cultures inhibit
or educate us in such a way as to make our relationship with our inward genius either
impossible um unthinkable fantastical right oh that's just a fantasy when this kind of thing
happens our humanity falls down the rungs of a ladder we've been climbing for thousands of human
generations and we get trapped in
terrain and by that I mean um the opportunity landscape is very
crude and low grade the threat landscape is exaggerated um the intelligence landscape
takes catastrophic hits constantly almost every time we use our minds and this is the situation
that most people will live and die within and most people have lived and died within for thousands
of years we're living in a context that literally punishes prodigy that it can't co-opt and sell us
counterfeits of and so even the people who managed to connect with their genius and managed to survive
that incredibly complex process which is very much like a second embryo a second uh
a second embryology right like like becoming an embryo in another domain of our humanity
and undergoing that same process of growth and maturation and successfully navigating
potential points of catastrophe or crisis until finally we are born this is the process this
process echoes or rather our relationship with genius one of the best analogies for that is
embryogenesis right um and thus we have for example
uh stories in religious books about what we would call the second birth it's precisely because
I think or at least let me put it a different way I don't like that language the resemblance
between our relationship with our genius and what could take place or excuse me what does take
place if we successfully become a human being right we undergo embryogenesis that relationship
has lots of resemblance yeah those there are similar threats there are similar opportunities
there are similar phases um it's a developmental ladder that was that that I think resembles
embryogenesis yet most of us you know we may have some casual experience of our genius if for
example we write songs or we write plays or we write stories or we make mathematical scientific
discoveries or we are dancers or we are actors or we are screenplay writers or perhaps um we have
some other degree of prodigy maybe the stock market just comes naturally to us uh or you know you can
think of almost any kind of behavior at which humans can excel and understand that it's conceivable
that our genius can be involved in that and that although I think most of us have a relatively
vague and distant relationship with that prodigy there are those of us in which it's
direct and like lightning right and having had some experience of this myself
the reason that I'm telling the story is that I think it's a tragedy that these perspectives
and orientations are not only no longer preserved in our modern culture
uh their opposite reigns supreme like a like a tyrannical overlay just like if you paved
a living place right this is the analogy of of what most human beings will experience of
their interiority because our cultures and the context to which we are generally exposed
reinforce
a process that resembles circumcision on the organ of ourselves in our souls in our hearts
that is
the organ within ourselves with which we relate with that genius with our own genius and with
the genius of others because the genius of others cat experiencing the genius of others
catalyzes memories and and a hunger in ourselves a knowledge that we too carry something like this
it's just so frustrated and inhibited that it cannot be expressed and again most of us will
live and die with very little experience of that although there are exceptions um in our lives
and one of the places where exceptions are common is in dreaming
but even dreaming our dreaming aspect is aware of this conflict yeah and it will present figures
that call us it will present figures of struggle and confusion and frustration
that call us back toward the possibility of reconnecting with with our inner genius
even though the the
even though it is as if the appendage like let's say
we're born with a special kind of wings and those wings lift us high enough
that our genius can reach down to us and we can reach up to it uh as if in that famous painting
where adam reaches toward the divine being and the divine being reaches down as if
that's a painting about everyone except it doesn't have to do with
the interpretations we've heaped on that image right it has to do with something
that's both universal and unimaginably personal just as personal as your own
relationship with your sexuality right except you have a capacity for relationships
with a form of intelligence that humans have been too timid to conceive of
and the origins of your mind are the result of your relationships with that intelligence
in childhood before you were before you underwent the process that that I would analogize as
as analogize as being circumcision right um and I think nearly all of us suffered dramatically
from that cultural process that circumcision and I think it's a tragedy and we can remedy
this tragedy and if we don't we'll be making a terrible mistake that will cause unimaginable
suffering and catastrophe we need to do something other than what our cultures have been scripted
to do for thousands of years which is essentially we need to be liberated from the paving over
of our capacities for intelligence and relation with living places and living beings
and living ideas we need to be rescued from this this pavement this pavement has to be shattered
and and the the green verdant vitality of the of all that is hidden beneath that cruel
inhibition
must see again the light of day within our lives and cultures
without being commodified without being sold back to us in little fucking packets of commodified
bullshit right um now when I speak of genius I'm actually talking about a subject that would
change the meaning of all human categories and there are such subjects and people who
we think of as geniuses since I've been using him as my stalking horse if I've got that language
right um I'll use Einstein right Einstein saw that there were fundamental problems with categories
that if if we get these categories wrong it's impossible for us to get anything right so one
of the goals that he had I think was just to apply I mean he had really ambitious goals but his
his simpler more accessible goal was to get us to think differently about time space light and
gravity because those are fundamental properties of that which is and if we've got those wrong we
can't get anything right and what I'm suggesting is that we have other of other categories wrong
the category of organism we've got that's wrong and if you get that wrong you can't get anything
right the category of human if it doesn't include the genius you've got it wrong and if you've got
the wrong idea of what genius is and you think it's a quality um peculiar to some specific human
beings who get lucky enough to embody and express it you've got it wrong right and if you get that
wrong everything's wrong there's a genius to nature there's the genius of that woodpecker
right that's making its call that drew me to this place and and was the fertilizing
catalyst of the video you're now watching
is that included in the idea of woodpecker in english fertilizing catalyst of prodigy no
and as I as I speak of this the woodpecker gets louder and louder as if as if it can hear me as
if it's celebrating being recognized beyond the categories we ordinarily presume to be sufficient
when they cannot be thus and will never be thus
there's another aspect of genius which is encoded in in the phrase genius low key
and that is the genius of a specific living place and we human beings belong to these living places
the way that wings belong to birds but unfortunately our relationship with knowledge
function value and commodity proximity place all these things have been so catastrophically
distorted that the only word I can come up with to describe such a process is amputation
right I've used the word circumcision earlier and this is a crucially important idea for me because
the intelligences we bring to birth as children are ready to they're they're poised they are um
perfectly prepared to acquire all different kinds of intelligent relationships with living places
with our genius with other forms of non-human intelligence with anything resembling intelligence
in human culture including language and knowledge and concepts and the stuff we acquire like a
disease that mostly shuts the stuff down cuts it off from our experience and access when we're
born as children it's as if we have I don't know I'll just make up a number say uh 173 different
unique um it's not an appendage what is it
we have a vast a wildly exotic array of unique potentials for contact and relation
with other forms of intelligence and it is the genius we bring into into birth as as children
that allows us to undergo the process of in-languaging and in-culturation that produces the crippled
version of ourselves that we refer to as a mature modern adult and that's a tragedy that I think has
to come to an end and it has to come to an end now not like someday in the future with some future
generation or maybe somewhere somehow someone will accomplish this we have to do this together
for the sake of all of human history for the sake of whatever future might be possible for our people
for the sake of the living places for the sake of the the history of and future of life on earth we
have to we have to accomplish this because if we don't the catastrophes that will there from ensue
are both unimaginable
and too tragic to evaluate
now one of the things that drew me today to this place
was that we're we're existing in this moment right now
in a very unusual set of circumstances
and one of the things that's happening for nearly all human beings right now
is that the fundamental bases that we use to derive identity value
meaning proximity
um opportunity threat reward all of these foundational elements that whose constellation
right we depend upon to determine what things are what they are for what can be done what we
will do what we shouldn't do what is good what is bad what is
prodigious what is ignorant all of these sort of um
all of these street signs all of these these pivotal inspirations
they have been tossed into chaos right they've been suspended
the the
the pivotal
as the stars were to ancient navigators the entire sky of pivotal navigational
elements has been completely thrown up in the air and is at this moment totally suspended
and what that means is both as individuals and as a as a p as you know a species and as nations
we are going to have to reestablish them and we're either going to reestablish the ones with
which we were previously familiar or we're going to do something a little smarter and recognize that
as we reestablish these uh way posts of of meaning and i and value and identity
we have the opportunity to do it in such a way that not only preserves
the inherent capacities for prodigy intelligence humanity kindness generosity
wonder awareness and awe that are
the unique gifts our ancestral
progenitors strove to bestow upon us
we can return
12 kinds of wings
to our minds and hearts and our capacity for relationships and that around which our human
societies orbit those markers of value and meaning and identity and reward and punishment and
threat and opportunity those markers represent a kind of gravity they are in a way like the sun
is they draw specifically character constellations of behavior out of human populations over time
if we change those we can change the behavior and we can recover the capacity to be an intelligent
species and that is a capacity we have long suffered without while pretending every other
thing and if that isn't obvious right now it never will be
it is always possible to raise the bar and it's always possible to raise it 15 rungs rather than
two and this is what genius is kind of about right it's it's kind of about the sense that
isn't necessarily proud or it doesn't need to accuse or denigrate it simply points a path
towards sudden unimagine previously unimaginable developmental efflorescence right you guys
we're dancing we're gonna take you from dancing on the earth to dancing with the stars okay
and not the ones on tv the ones in the ocean of the sky that are the origin of minds and beings
and life and the possibility of intelligence and much of our human capacity for for actually
intelligent awareness and understanding and behavior it's tied up with our relationship
with categories in language again if you get those categories wrong if you got the wrong idea what
genius means or the wrong idea what an animal is or your idea of the sun is far too limited to
have anything to do with what's actually going on in and as the sun if you break if those categories
undergo lossy compression which is exactly what's been happening or at least is a perfect analogy
it's a technological analogy that's what's been happening with the categories over evolutionary
over developmental time of human societies the fundamental categories on which knowledge
are based have been undergoing this incredibly um this rapidly accelerating process of lossy
compression and that means they lose dimensions of meaning right they lose dimensions accessible to
our awareness of meaning and relation possible relation so that one day the woodpecker is just
another bird it's not it's no longer a signal from eternity to the possibility of direct
relation with the genius of a place which is somehow an invitation to our own intrinsic genius
and prodigy and spirit and soul and heart when our hearts ache
that's a real sense that's a sense more subtle than vision but richer and older and deeper
and absolutely trustworthy it isn't that our hearts cannot be fooled into aching of course they can
and much of our media and what we call entertainment is depends on the capacity
to mimic prodigy and greatness in such a way that we become involved in a sort of reverse
projection game yeah where somehow the endlessly unfulfilled thirst this endlessly unfulfilled
hunger for excellence in the core of our being that is with us in every moment of every day of
our lives and is sublimated because it is inhibited and frustrated and often punished
or co-opted and commodified by our cultures this prodigy we carry is hinted at in stories
in films and we can be sold a kind of candy bar counterfeit where instead of reacquiring a
relationship with our genius and embodying that and fulfilling that we will settle for the rapper
we will settle for the appearance we will settle for the mimic for the mimicked
storyline right that is reminiscent of something we were born to live far more than
right now the fundamental pivots of identity and meaning are suspended
they're in unknown positions and some of them will fall back to earth
in forms in shapes that are worse than what they were before we entered pandemonium as a people
but we in our capacity to form intelligent humane skillfully motivated unions in that capacity we
have the opportunity right now and that may be a short window to establish something that
actually resembles intelligent human culture so that the inherent
the staggering array of inherent faculties available to us as human beings will be returned
to our common understanding awareness experience and embodiment and that is my dream and that is
the dream of my genius a genius that i was so lucky to have touched in this lifetime directly
and known in person a thing more astonishing than all the stories that i've ever been exposed to
in human culture by thousands and thousands of times more i can't express there is no hyperbole
significant enough to express the difference between the actual experience of of having that
moment however brief or long it may last when one's humanity reaches into an unknown dimension
high above the paved battlefield and makes contact
with its essence and that is a moment divine and that is the origin that's why we have
that's why we have all the mimicry that's why we have all this entertainment
that's why we have religions that's why we have technology
those things are the shadows
of our societal and communal failure
to keep that possibility protected and alive and to reward it and to revere it
not to overstand it but to understand it together
so that is my dream and i'm grateful to this living place and all of its living beings
and to the woodpecker that has so often drawn me out from my humble shell
into a situation where my intelligence feels at home perhaps yours does too
bye bye for now
