Hello, everyone, welcome.
There's an old and natural association between seers, whatever we may mean by this, and wisdom,
whatever we may mean by this.
And in a sense, a seer is anyone who sees what is very difficult or uncommon to see,
but also who sees, perhaps spiritually, which what does this even mean?
It means, perhaps, outside of time, outside of tradition, outside of common supposition,
outside of expectation, beyond meta, meta, and those who see know a simple secret that
is often overlooked.
And it is that beginnings are sacred and should be treated with reverence, and so the first
movement, the first gesture, the first offering in any relationship or communication
should be made with deep awareness of its capacity to fertilize all future branchings
of the relationships and situations that are founded, initiated in a first gesture, as
if time, space, and relation are virginal.
And any first movement
cares the envelope of time, history, and relation.
And this is different for males and females.
The females have the hymen, which comes, I think, from the Greek word hyma, meaning blood.
The virginity of males is not, is mysterious.
It's not merely physical.
And that which breaks the hyma does not necessarily directly fertilize the matrix or the womb,
but it affects its present, historical, and future metaphysical structure in a sense.
It's what we might think of as the web of its energetic aspect, which we might think
of as primordial to its physicality, right?
Not an afterthought, the energetic aspect is not an afterthought.
It's primordial.
It comes before, exists during, and persists after physical transformations, physical emergence,
and so forth.
So in the beginning, this old bird, it's very, very beautiful, he's an old man, he knows.
But he is also, he's very nervous, this old blue jay, who's following me, who I'm feeding
from my hand.
People who are wise and who can see will revere
the encompassing circumstances and the initial movements, actions, choices, speech.
Not merely of a relationship, right?
Not merely those that begin relationships, which are profoundly important, but also those
that begin communications.
So the first time one communicates with another person, or a place, or an animal, or a situation,
a lineage, a history, perhaps even a linguistic.
This is why we have in the beginning of a written communication, the feature that we
refer to as the salutation.
And often in the salutation, and this is so strange because in our modern situation, we're
missing 90% of the crucial content.
And by content, I mean understanding, awareness, memory, and amnesis.
The real knowledge, not the structured remains of what was once alive, not the skeletal remains
of insight, liberation, beauty, magic, musea, potency, not that.
So in our written communications they may begin with a cruelly abbreviated homage, dear,
dear person of the first name.
And of course there are various honoraria that are employed to respect the status of
persons whose social or logistical, or political, sociopolitical status, or academic status,
or medical status, has been raised above that of what we might think of as the common
citizen, or even a slave.
And we should remember that slaves weren't allowed to have, in some places anyway, slaves
weren't allowed to have filial names, I think, if I recall correctly.
But my point here isn't really this.
What I want to highlight is that when we begin to address someone, we are addressing the
entire lineage from which that person arises, or for which that person is the embodied expression
and temporally local to us embodiment of.
And so, unlike our modern habits, we should have presence of awareness of just how profound
this is, and not merely in our first interaction, which connects our lineage and theirs.
The entirety of our history, all of my grandmothers and grandfathers, all of the living places
that were like wombs to us, all of the creatures who gave us food, shelter, comfort, all of
the beings who sacrificed their lives to keep us alive while we drew breath, all of the
insects, all of the plants that we related with, that our lineage was relating with,
and was the living emergent hand of all of these matters, which literally means all of
these mothers.
All of these matters should remain in our heart and the spirit of our action as holy,
and in the sense of belonging to some religious tradition, in the sense of becoming the living
elixir of an amnoesis, unforgettable.
In listening recently to Amman Hillman, who at times rages like a prophet, and at other
times speaks moderately like a scholar, and it's wonderful to see that range, that spectrum,
curve in his thought, concern, expression, he has an awareness of such matters, it seems,
and also perhaps of the strange results of intentionally violating them, and I don't
mean to speak for him, he's quite capable of speaking for himself, but what I will speak
of is the peculiar cross fertilization that I experience and am here expressing that arises
as a result of the exposure to the strange elixir of his thought, his reverence for the
ancient Greek, and even the purple, the purple, his exposition, his orations, act on me, I
don't have to concern myself much with what we might describe as his veracity.
Dan McClellan is excellent at attempting this, whether or not he succeeds is another story,
but as a master of public, the demonstration of public knowledge and public debate, McClellan
is extremely skillful, difficult to doubt at best, but McClellan is overlooking something,
something fundamental, which is the spirit in which endeavors are composed, in which they
are conceived.
And so before I continue today, I want to pay homage to your ancestors, the lineages you
are the living organ of, your mothers, my mothers, our fathers, the beings who supported
and nurtured and sheltered and fed and sustained us, all of them, the living places, the insects,
the plants, the microorganisms, the sky, the gods, the angels, the diamonds, all those
beings who have, the humans have nomenclature to refer to, and those they do not, and in
our time that's probably most of them, because our lexicons are impoverished compared to the
grandeur they might once have known and bodied.
And these first gestures comprise one of the pivots that is very important, not merely
in relation, but in speaking.
And particularly if relations become intimate, to intelligently resist the possibility of
violation, we must negotiate consent.
And there's a catastrophic difference between formal negotiations of consent, which are often
crucial, especially if what are involved are groups of humans or beings, and the informal
but nonetheless successful and or, by successful I mean successful in determining the existence
of and expressions of consent in a relationship.
Now consider two human beings approaching each other, walking on the street.
Now this is a completely bizarre and in a sense very confused and almost wrong in the
sense of like it shouldn't really exist this way, but you have two strangers approaching
each other on the street.
There's a variety of perfunctory glances toward each other or peripherally encompassing the
other.
There's a complex negotiation that leads either to, well it leads to a broad array of forms
of observation and purposes for observation or non-observation, purposes for relation or
non-relation.
The female of the j-pair has come with her mouth full of moths to greet me as if to
signal approval and perhaps consent.
She observes from afar that her mouth is full of moths is symbolically profound.
She is gathering the moths in her mouth as they hatch and or as they mate.
Now the male is near me.
He looks at me turning back and forth with his two eyes.
His left eye sees broadly, his right eye sees specifically.
If he looks at me it is with his right eye.
If he sees for me it is with his left eye.
He sees around me with his left eye.
Above us are raven but there are hawks that live here predators and if you think that
the blue jays are different from us you're right but not in all of the senses that you
may think.
There are beings above us winged beings that travel quickly in time and relation and some
of them are predatory and few of them are helpful but some of them can be.
In the same way these jays have forged a relationship with me, a slow moving land creature compared
to them, one who lives long compared to them, one who is in some senses above their way
of life beyond their way of life.
I connect them with my people and they connect me with their people and who knows perhaps
at death our positions may invert and they will be above me and I will be delicate and
short lived.
I've heard such stories of jay-headed sentinels and escorts near the river Lethe.
And when we come together you know we humans we have this perfunctory and confusing relationship
with consent particularly sexually between men and women.
I heard a wonderful vignette between Eric Weinstein and Anna Kvakian I probably mispronouncing
her name.
Kvakian?
I can't quite recall.
One of the hosts of Red Scare, the Red Scare podcast and they have a beautiful little colloquy
surrounding this topic of consent in the age of political correctness even if they are
both largely what we might refer to perhaps mistakenly as cisgendered.
And thus why do I say perhaps mistakenly because the most common use of this particular
nomenclature is to divest people of the right to speak at all on matters related to gender
identity and or the relationship between the genders.
Most often this is a term of denigration and almost an insult.
Not always, commonly.
I just saw a creature that I don't know what it was, it was fast and small but too large
to be an ordinary insect.
I wonder if I have managed somehow accidentally to comprise a context in which actual magic
may begin to emerge in the ordinary, in the otherwise ordinary spacious living time of
this garden.
This is a possible thing.
And it needn't involve strange rights.
It needn't involve explicit erotic behavior.
It needn't involve violence or violation.
It needn't involve taboo.
Then the fundamental ingredient of transcendental non-ordinary experience is memory, acknowledgement,
honoring, inclusion, not in the D-I-E sense, D-E-I sense.
So I'm going to stop taking pokes at Woke's ideology.
I'll stop there.
Inclusion in the enameletic sense of recognition of antecedents and progeny, acknowledgement,
honoring, making offerings of reverence and humility
to the entire spectrum, the broad arcs of the ancients.
Think how uncommon this is in our time.
Any person or group doing this would light up like a star, like a constellation of stars
on the surface of the earth and in the temporal manifold.
The moment as it is participated and observed by many beings, most of whom have no place
in the lexicons of the speakers of English, some of whom have a place in the lexicons
of the speakers of Hebrew, some of whom have a place in the lexicons of the speakers of
ancient Greek and other languages.
Hindi, Japanese, Chinese, Russian, each of the languages is like a spoke on a wheel of
identity containing lost features, features that went missing from the others, some of
the others.
And sometimes having unique elements that were never present in them.
True reverence and amnoetic reverence is powerful, perhaps more powerful than incantations, spells.
And certainly inclines other beings to recognize our own posture, role, the meaningful aspects
of the feathers of our identity, which are the wings of our spirit.
One of the things I hear when I hear Amun speak is the dulcet tones of an impassioned
orator.
He's capable of the old, some of the old amazing stuff, right?
He's capable of being possessed.
And one of the important features, well I don't want to leave my topic just yet.
The topic, okay, so let me return.
I will get, I'm getting as they say ahead of myself, which almost means oops, I formed
a second mind that is interfering with the one that I'm currently now using to navigate
at the moment, or to express, or to see, or to speak, or to hope, to pursue.
Because the topic of oration is very profound, ah orachio, ah orachio seems to mean, I probably
mispronouncing this, but in the mutual exploration I was listening to earlier between Gnostic
and Conformant, Amun and Aerial, Amun said ah orachio, and again I may be mishearing
or pronouncing this, it means unseen, but it sort of implies, if I've got the resemblance
right here, it implies unspoken, non-verbal, ah orachio, ah oration, non-speaking, or anoration,
be that as it may, I may have that wrong.
Sometimes Mondagrens are more revelatory of the mind of the listener, and its subterranean,
the structure and the psyche of the mind of the listener, the coral reefs of consciousness
underneath the ocean.
But I was speaking of beginnings and the importance of understanding the nuanced possibilities
of intelligent signaling, and particularly the understanding that first gestures are
crucially pervasive over future transformations and emergencies, they determine the forms,
they have a powerful determinative influence on what comes after them.
So it's sort of the opposite of prophecy, instead of you retract yourself from inaction
in a timeline that you're carefully observing, it's almost like the abstraction of temporality,
you invoke, you fertilize this moment together, you infertilize this moment according to your
mutually, not merely exciting, but impassioned or honored or fervently hoped for.
And as if the entire audience of the history of the participants, the entire lineage audience
is participating, recognized, invoked, adored, remembered, brought back to, resurrected in
you and those to whom, or the one to whom you, with whom you are in communion, you enter
into communion together. And you know, of course there's a, there's a vulgar, you know,
our modernity is so vulgar in this sense. And there are those who celebrate this vulgarity
in the sense that it violates the kind of dead, concrete structure of tradition, expectation,
organized religion and so forth. Okay, okay, I get it. You know, shoot them with a bullet,
it's not what I mean. But this is what I mean by the vulgarity and its, its explicitly, its
explicit violation of expectation and tradition and perhaps falsely sacred lines of culture,
thought and exposition, action, rulemaking, punishment, inquisition. Surely the idea of
inquisition is practiced by some Christians and perhaps others is a horrifying caricature of
the possibility of questing to seek with noble heart and a self-unclothing, right, a star of
intention that dissolves its armor as it proceeds within us as our hearts, as our spirits, as our
incarnate bodies. So much of our modernity is very vulgar. So unlike the dragonfly that has
lit upon this branch before me, whose eyes are worlds, whose ancestors are myriad,
who is in fact a doorway, a forest of portals, alive and beckoning
to those who understand and remember, to those who recognize,
to those who can sing the pay-ins,
and to sing such pay-ins,
I must be dispossessed of my personal identity and this is the possibility of real humility
from which an authentic salutation may emerge.
Sometimes in the Tibetan Buddhist scriptures we hear something and it would be wonderful to hear
it in the original language, but we hear something like that is translated in English into the phrase
Oh Noble One and almost always when we hear this phrase it is a call to transcendental
anemesis. Oh Noble One and as I say this
I was gazing into the eyes of the dragonfly a couple of inches from my face
though my vision gets old now it's blurry. I used to be able to see with pristine clarity
at every distance but now close up things blur to see clearly I must retreat from them
and we think of this as a physical problem a mechanical problem and it is and yet
the metaphor of it is also quite profound I think yeah
you know
the vocalizations of the birds are living an amnoesis
they are not expressing abstract things they are not words
I don't believe they are representational though I believe it's conceivable that the birds have
similar assets I just don't think they express them vocally
though I could well be wrong about this there is much to learn about the
the language of the birds and their musics
a living mystery
alive to our perception largely invisible to our cognition
resembling in this sense our own dreams
you know I'm willing now to depart
the arcs of the first topic but hold them in your thought and concern
if you will as I proceed
because by elucidating them it is my way of paying homage to the ancestral beings
the progenitors of our being in the sky and on the earth and beyond the sky
and our own progeny our our future children many of whom you know we imagine as humans that
your children are the children you give birth to no we um
um
we parent one another when we adore one another we become uh it's funny
I don't want to use the legal language but in loco parentis
we uh adopt each other in life through relation and care and concern and love
we adopt one another and so too
we adopt each other's families and are adopted by them to varying degrees
depending on our capacities for relational intimacy deeper
than the specific human with whom we may be engaged in the moment right the meta
I met a morph his eyes shining
a poecism from an old friend
whose intelligence was so profound and I'm sure still is
there are many opposites of consent
there's the obvious sort of direct violation of consent
that we understand to be rape whether it's physical emotional relational
financial circumstantial situational
an egregious violation of any kind comprises a form of rape
and one of the members of the extinction adi with whom I was in conversation
and the other day was expositing on
the rape imposed on us through the concept of
equality of commodities and how Aristotle I believe I believe I'm I'm depending on my
rather frail memory here in his nicomachean ethics and I'm probably mispronouncing max
I I've only heard it pronounced once or twice I'm spoke of how this uh imposition of equality
among things that cannot be equal is the origin of every problem even more significant than the
problem of money which is certainly um catastrophically primordial in the history and emergence of
wrongdoing among humans injustice agony rape just as that horrifying noise violates my sanity
and body and mind the unjustifiable
derivation of our being and lives into
dollars and cents and numbers in banks
what won't the humans do there is no answer that list is blank what won't they do on moss
once the necessity of money is introduced which collapses all values to one representation
all histories all futures all ancestors all children all progenitors
but I'm getting again I've
I've departed the path of my intention so there are so many fascinating implications
of some of the concepts that Anand Hillman introduces and I've allowed myself to become
a bit enchanted not so much with the man who I know little of but with his orations and concerns
and in this in a sense in in conversations with friends of late I have mimicked his vocal style
in the sense that we might that they might the listener might imagine I am mocking him
but I'm not mocking him I'm attempting to invoke his mind right and well this goes more
toward the topics that I'm going to chase so we have this idea in the west under Christianity
of demonic possession and what we think this means usually is informed by like the film The
Exorcist or whatever it's bad to be possessed by demons because they're evil and they're
eternally hungry and they will murder and rape and destroy and cause war and plagues and all of
these things right they are the essentially the the matrix or womb in which evil is conceived
and from which it emerges into our human experience in the world and this is at best confused
and at worst completely wrong and we should be very very careful when we come under the
enchanting sway of a concept that is almost completely wrong or very close to being completely
wrong it's probably true that there are no things which are explicitly untrue that can be conceived
right in the sense that conception itself is a mode of truth right the conceivable
is truly conceived the speakable is truly spoken in the sense of of being it is there right I have
spoken these words they are spoken it's true that I've spoken them and it's a similar kind of truth
in conception but there are inconceivable things which are also true and perhaps there are inconceivable
things which are not true but we should not be too concerned about truth and falsity rather we
should be concerned with seeing the nobility of our of our spirit and relations and by nobility I
don't mean the wealth I mean the relational integrity I mean the virtue not the counterfeits
of virtue that wear the clothing no the essential virtue and you know when we listen
to music that is profound
we should be aware of the relationship to the concept of the muses in Greece in Greek
the musea those places where the muses prevail over above are instructive to
our otherwise mundane humanity to be possessed by the muses is not
perhaps at all demonic but rather angelic and to be possessed by angels could be as bad
as our imaginings of possession by demons
these two words are very peculiar and I may pursue their disambiguation a bit later but
for the moment what I will do is say something very strange suppose that there are intelligences
transcendental to those of humans and progenerative of those of humans
whose eros results in the possibility of minds right whose eros results whose relational and
enacted eros results in the possibility of minds and these beings are not as we imagine
black or white red or blue near or far past or future but are rather
always profusely dimensional dimensionalized and what happens when we relate with them
is that our modes and motives and desires collapse that multimodal
multi-dimensional transcendental potential toward something that matches up with our
gestures in the relationship and I will argue that all beings and situations are thus
and this is actually the fundamental principle on which
relatively conceptually ridiculous cults
that orbit the concept of quote manifestation unquote emerge from
suppose then that the field being the multi-dimensional field being
that we may experience as
a demon or an angel or a daemon an intelligent non-human
in what interlocutor
one with whom we have something resembling intellectual intercourse or
even more like the intercourse of intelligences
and the broad array of possible forms of eros
that lie beyond the act of getting our physical flowers involved in rubbing against each other
in some way rubbing up against things and I'm not casting aspersions on physical eros
I'm just saying that the library of eros of modes and forms and purposes of eros that is
that are accessible to us is so far beyond our imagining that often it's as if we're
trading the wrapping you know the envelope in which the wedding invitation arrives for the experience
of the wedding and the honeymoon and the children and the whole you know the whole actual
the whole of the living
intimacies the the forest and the oceans of the living intimacies that are not merely our birthright
and our natures they are our origins and perhaps in some sense our purpose of
more horrifying noises brought to you by human technique
they are the purpose of the living purpose of matrix from which our incarnations ensue
now one of the things that amans orations have
caused me caused my attention to turn toward because he seems to be saying things about
you know he seems to be a proponent of orgiastic frenzy under the influence of complex venoms
from snakes plants dusts human bodies he seems to be a proponent of the application
of elixirs formed in the bodies of women primarily and of orgiastic frenzy and perhaps even death
that is then obviated through the careful application of staggeringly sophisticated antidotes
the purple brah in his eyes
and he may well be it's up to him to assert his predilections
but what he has brought to fruition in my awareness what I have gleaned from exposure to his madness
which is itself like one of those elixirs when he's at his best right it's intoxicating
it's enchanting and one of the
one of the modulence of consent is enchantment hypnos trance this can modulate consent now
ordinarily um an actual hypnotist will uh
usually under most circumstances there might be some exceptions where the patients has already
agreed to treatment or so forth but they will um illicit consent right and one of the simplest
ways to do this that was the first way demonstrated to me is to just ask someone would you like to
feel better right now and i'm not offering that here because if i'm enchanting you you've already
given your consent by listening right you've chosen to have my voice in your ears so
the consent is there present and you also have the capacity to turn away if you find my
the spirit of my oration or my words or the these ideas objectionable as some will certainly do
i've often lost close companions over their objections to their interpretations of my
speech or writing and what they think i'm trying to do which almost which is almost never what
i'm actually trying to do well very rarely when they depart from me it's almost never what i'm
they've misconstrued me in some way usually very dramatically
nonetheless enchantment is a drug it uh it's an intoxicant
in the sense that it transforms the basis of our waking world awareness and the great
orators and sophists and the rapsodes of greece both were uniquely excellent in their capacity
capacity to enchant not merely with language but with music literally with the
you know i would not call them drugs i would call them
modes the modes of spirit the modes of the concentration of spirit meaning vital flow water
wind the modes of in structuring this flow over time that produce non-ordinary experience
we adore the brilliant poet the brilliant orator
uh arindati roi ursula keila gwyn
lin margullus
norah baitson tamson woolly barker on a good day
martin luther king john f canady nelson mandela
perhaps steven bico
before he was assassinated
the prophets
ibn arabi
i won't name prophets many i'm gonna carefully not name a few lau tzu
and those whose names i hear admit omit because we you know socrates himself wrote no books
and other prophets wrote no books and prophets that wrote books
or about whom books were written become very dangerous for us because those
the existence of those books tends to weaponize the humans weaponize their results
and this is as tragic as it is devastating to human awareness and intimacy and potential
where it is not actively liberating it becomes devastating
by the way that word deva that um
that word refers to something we know little of
intelligences from beyond the sky beyond time angels the davas the jinn the daimons the demons
the devils and again imagine that all those words actually refer to one form of potential
that much like uh the wasp
if related with intelligently and with awareness
this nearly will never harm you and may endow you with elixirs of wisdom and insight
from their people from their lineage from their future and i have been thus touched by a wasp
once in my life to my shock and tearful ecstasy
but if you threaten them now you have you want a demon they'll show you demons
you will regret drawing breath very quickly and and they will intoxicate you with their venoms
all right so what i am trying to say is that i have
in my own way drunk a little bit of the elixir from almond's cups
and the resulting intoxications have given me wisdom i can see better more deeply and one
of the things i see is that in our culture we celebrate possession okay those rock bands
the pop singers mcdonald's jack in the box
our brilliant orators who are almost never our politicians for reasons so
ironic because these people should be very skillful sincere orators but they are neither
they are counterfeits
our police and our soldiers should be the liberators of the oppressed not
not the predators that act at the behest of the wealthy the slave owners the war makers
the warmongers the corporations which are in the worst sense demons and possess our lives
we are possessed they demand that we submit to their possession
while we work for them in the daytime in the nighttime
that is violation that is rape even when we consent because the consent is not free
we cannot see it is forced and it is primarily forced by the bizarre inhuman
demonic imposition of structured economies
that make slaves of us all and insult our ancestors and ruin our children
we celebrate possession think of the actors surely these human beings want to know
the breadth of the scope of the possibility of being possessed by a character they are not
a historical character a possible character a future character
you see the temporalization features here
roomy was possessed by the spirit of eros and wisdom the spirits of eros and wisdom
at the same time we're collapsing into intercourse inside his heart
right and he a helpless and not helpless he a brilliant participant in that magical eros
was so bold
as to experience the necessity
of making their music in the language he was familiar with
california's age
uh
it is exquisite california's sage brush magic alive in my hand
hi
the actors the orators you know in ancient greece socrates was
aamon speaks of the sting of the gadfly and how this is related to the concept of clistos
and this is specifically the vector along which dan mclellan attacks him
very effectively in my view dan's quite effective you don't want to have to face that guy he's got
nine swords where you have you know a teaspoon or whatever
though i'd like to see a face off i guess i'm not a huge fan of combat
and combat was really mostly about verity right veracity because it was believed primarily that
the non-human intelligences would pervade over the field and make known their
insights and preferences in the bodies of the victors but that's a broadly confused mistake
because often the vanquished are the holy victory is not is not equivalent to holy this is the
rape of the equal sign that my my conversational companion was talking about right victory equals
holiness nope not true nuance equals wisdom sensitivity awareness equals perception
you got some rules that you think apply to you know situations with a billion dimensions
you think you can collapse them down to two and then make a pick
um this is hubris of the most devastating kind this is the hubris that summons nemesis
to instruct you
you
we adore possession we celebrate celebrate possession if the christians or the muslims
wanted actual purity
i'm wiping the branch of the sagebrush across my eyelids
to cleanse my seeing if they wanted purity if they wanted fundamentalist devotion
which is almost always insane because it's not driven by any communication with the divine
or any fulfillment of some divine program protocol template for virtue rather it is schizogenic
it is the fulfillment of literal interpretations of dead text
and that will never be holy by the time you have to formalize the rules
there is no more communion you are lost there's no hope for you because your
the spirit wind of the communal vitality and virtue origin and purpose
and progeny progenial future an amniotic insight is dead and what you've got is bones
and you keep making boxes with them
by the time you have to tell humans that slaughtering each other is bad
the rules and laws can no longer help you
you
unless you resurrect the spirit of virtue in your mind heart and relations
and this must be discovered not declared
by the time you have to formalize the rules
you have the problem of individuals self-interest commodities
representations that stand in the absence of that to which they once may have somehow referred
and where you have representations of virtue
you have something like that
the fuck even is that it dominates the world and it's not even there it's not alive
somebody felt their right of way was violated so they decided to thunder to the whole planet about
it what even is that
I mean that's the malignant idea of a demon but here's the thing
as a musician and a poet and a writer I long ago began to experience situations in which
something took possession of me that wasn't me and was beautiful something I trusted
something fundamentally virtuous and intelligent beyond my capacities for virtue or intelligence
and it made songs it made poems it made essays it made orations and hopefully today if I am
unimaginably lucky there's some of that happening here
something in me something beyond me that isn't me that isn't merely me
I have invoked it
on purpose not because I am proud or skillful
because I am impassioned by the possibility of virtue
the opposite of that noise
that terrible noise of the mock eyes in energy systems
the beings that are not beings the hammer the engine the battleship the bomb the missile
the battle
almost all penetrative with the exceptions of the screens which are
gravidic
this word gravid means filled with eggs and filled with eggs we might imagine means
filled with billions of as yet unborn children and their intelligences filled with the wombs
of countless grandmothers of every possible kind not merely human
filled with the intelligences of the grandfathers
these sacred substances that Amman speaks of are sacred for reasons that are not vulgar
you
intelligence itself involves the reduction
of the personal identity to a minimal trace
and this is what is required in dreaming this is what is required in dreaming
the personal identity is no longer so explicit and our identity is spread out among all the
features of the dreamscape with which we are intimate in the dreaming
we
have the false possession of fake politicians and orators and then we have the real possession
of true politicians and orators which we very rarely see these days orders more and if the
if the fundamentalists were as fundamentalist as they should be if they're very very concerned
about us being possessed by anything other than the Holy Spirit quote unquote whatever I mean I
believe don't misunderstand me I'm not casting aspersions on that noble virtuous brilliant
light not by a long shot rather I'm very concerned about what the humans have made of it
but if they're very concerned they would tell us read no books because to read a book is to become
possessed and not merely of the mind of the author but of all of the minds that were pro-generative
of that author's concerns speech skills
the entire historical family that gives birth to this author's book and the entire family of those
who read it and and thus become its children it's fertilizing our minds we're having intercourse
with something above the human and we think oh no that's
that's just Aristotle that's just the bible that's just uh dune right that's just the origins of
consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind by julie and james that's julie and james
right frank herbert that's just arthur c clark um that's just you know the author it's never that
was never even possibly true there's no chance of that being true acts of musea draw us up above
our ordinary humanity and this is what we ache to experience and remember and become together
because the terrifying prison of our personal identity is a cascade of ever more furious
impoverishments that we must escape and this is why we are addicts this is why we go we are missing
the nectars of the intelligences above our humanity that we were born to interact with
and become together and and without these nectars we go to their substitutes nicotine media ideology
politics legality language
if real fundamentalists if you should only worship jesus if you should only worship mohammed
you will read no books
hello hi sweetie
because to read books is to become possessed and to be inseminated and
invaginated by their authors and you know some people say darin darin you've gone too far why
why do you have to use these these words that are indelicate
it because the delicacy is hiding something profound that we need to see together
eros is the fundamental basis of concern without it are there not things that you can't stand
are there foods you don't want are there forms of speech that you don't like
but the cause discussed in your cognition or mind are there noises that you don't like
do you prefer hot or cold would you rather be
unusually warm or unusually cold i don't mean to a lethal degree
are there flavors but you just you just don't want that in your mouth
how do you know how to navigate in consciousness is it not by affinity because if it's by affinity
and disaffinity then it's by eros and and her antithesis that you travel in consciousness
that you determine whether you agree or disagree with something is a matter of eros
from this useful perspective it's not the only one rationality we think is a rule-based system for
the determinative dissection of concept situations processes and predictions
but it there's a there's a factor in there that isn't merely rational
it's an amnoetic it's memory it's eros and eros and memory are fundamentally associated
in the human soul and so to the mind so to the body so to the behavior
so possession turns out to be nine-tenths of the law
in the most unexpected way right it didn't it didn't mean who's got the object in their pocket
rather it means
whose minds who are the minds with whom you are intimate
and whose intelligences are fundamentally trustworthy familiar true an amnoetic
anti-lethal unforgettable
now this leaves aside the
very complex implications well I'm not going to leave them aside there's another
array of implications in Amman's scholarship surrounding death and resurrection now I mean
imagine an ancient world where resurrection and death were relatively common and were part of
initiation rites right so that initiates knew that when they began the process of initiation
they were going to die or come extremely close to death and then at the last moment be resurrected
so that they could see beyond the veil right they would have knowledge
of the impossible of the forbidden and what is most forbidden of all things
the most forbidden thing is knowledge of death
when the little child what is his name in the hindu wisdom tale
I cannot right now located in memory the little child goes to visit the avatar of death and
do you ever sell your paintings
may I uh inquire about that
I understood why you were rude to me
I understood you were in trance and I was interrupting you the flaw is mine not yours
that's amazing that you remember
it's amazing that you remember we both remember
oh thank you for that sir
here is my my card my name is Darren what is your name Joe Joe a real pleasure to meet you Joe
your vision of color is unbelievably profound it's just magically
provocative I've never seen anything like that and I'm I'm an aficionado of painting I've never
seen light like that in your canvases is it okay yeah excellent yeah yeah
yeah and what I do is I I don't have a gallery or anything so I'm gonna bypass the gallery so
what I do is I just meet people like yourself and they come up to my house or go to their house or
whatever yeah yeah and then we just it's just an interpersonal thing we have to pay that's so much
more it's not just the paying of the gallery it's the uh it's the humanity of the relationship
right it's authentic right I appreciate that yeah I will I will be in touch with you Joe
I'm so grateful that we met today I am too that's ironic but the nicest person of the whole day and
I hope I wasn't too rude you know it's like I I I used I try not to be rude you know but once
I start talking because like I know you I know you're so interesting and a lot of other people
are quite interesting so I I forget about that and like you into the conversation which is wonderful
too yes you know it's an interpersonal thing it's very it is but I also have this problem that once
I start to make face noises my consciousness collapses into this right and that's a different
thing from writing or making music or making art right if you're writing you're not talking
making music you're not speaking maybe you could speak and cook
but I don't think I do this well you know well we're I come from Italians right and so in the
kitchen it's conversation and cooking they kind of go together but but yeah I'm cautious about
mixing I knew what I knew why you said no I was very clear in my heart no you just said no
that's all you did you didn't even say anything actually you didn't say anything you just said
that's all it's all you did no no I understood it's a little painful right because I'm like oh
I felt that I had intruded that's why it was painful it wasn't rude
no it's very nice to compliment me that way but yeah I appreciate your skillfulness the light
the way you play with the light I've known one or two other painters who can make light on the camp
make light come out of the canvas you know illuminate it yeah it's a spiritual thing
it's all good
right you only honestly one and a half but two hours so you know the light is going and then
I always cheat a little bit you know you cheat and you gotta do it but anyway you know it's
I just learned how to do this I'm so non-technical this
yeah oh yeah
it's like an it's like an enchantment you're making an enchantment it's it's like a magic thing
yeah yeah but it's you
but it takes all three and maybe something else it takes the canvas and the place and the light
and you and the sky yeah yeah the big spirit we agree this is what I'm making a recording about
right so some of my listeners will hear your voice I hope you don't mind oh that's okay
Darren okay good it's consent matters oh yeah yeah such a pleasure to meet you and to touch your
human hand my goodness thanks for remembering that's of course I recognized you I'm so I love
me too it's the possibility yeah culture depth
um yeah all blessings peace
hmm that was a lucky moment that man's paintings are astonishing I've never seen anything like it
it they're just filled with this amazing living color and I approached him the other day and I said
may I speak with you for a moment and he just shook his head and it was a rebuke but I understood
what was going on all right so back to this topic right I'm on never before have I heard
anyone say and look my own the scope of my exposure is minimal but never have I heard anyone imply that
as part of initiatory traditions
we might be subjected to death and of course we have the concept
which is probably misapprehended from the French of orgasm as the little death and the association
between orgasm and death
as if orgasm is a is some kind of ecstatic suspension
of the rhythm and pulses that bind us to existence
out as if orgasm happens outside of time and this is the association with the non-human
intelligence there's the daimons the devas the jinn the angels you know I think demons and devils
are vulgar derivations of such ideas
but you know what Amon seems to be implying and I intend to inquire
of him about this is that there were initiatory rites and rituals and poisons involving
particularly the mixtures of venoms of various snakes and possibly other reptiles
mixtures of bodily secretions mixtures of plant substances very very complex pharmacopoeia
pharmacoya I'm I don't know the greek words I'll probably probably getting them wrong
um but I'm trying making the effort the essay and he implies that at least indirectly if not
directly that um the seers many of the seers and the prophets and the wise men had undergone
these initiatory rituals in which they were either killed or brought to the brink of death
and revived and try to imagine living in a world where death and resurrection is common
and so those who can resurrect you are messianic
and then we end up getting you know representational derivatives of this in the apocalypse and so
forth um and and the idea gets weaponized so that now only the elect are uh
uh
resurrection is accessible only to the elect or the sanctified or the the anointed
and that you have to go to this person and be anointed by this messiah or eternal suffering
and damnation or um just destruction obliteration
and so you know you can imagine that you know I once opined that um I mean I have a series of
essays on my blogger site which is called dream knots knot s and these are essays written when I was
under the influence of contact with a non-human intelligence in 2009 10 and beyond
and they are essays about conception and embryology they are
sygenic right it's there's a difference between orations and texts that are sygenic
and those that make the claim of fact
and the amazing thing about Amon is that his way of speaking and the topics that fascinate him
and his expression of them are fundamentally sygenic at least for me you know your your mileage may vary
and so it what it's it's not like I'm trying to say oh Amon he's got it right that's not what I'm
trying to say at all Amon's dance in the music of language is astonishing
and beautiful and profound
and enchanting in a way that if received in the proper spirit will produce insight right it will
generate that perspective up above where we normally
up above our normal habituate habituations
you know in cities that are not flat
primarily the wealthy live up high and that's not an accident the gods and the angels and
the daimons and and the devas and the jinn they are the habituates of the high places
which are closer to origin right if the sky is the most is the nearest representation of origin
then
to be closer to the to the sky is to be closer is to be proximal to the
originary intelligences the progenerative intelligences from which our minds and bodies
and ways of life and incarnations emerge right the matrix the womb
and the sky itself is it is it is as if it's a secondary womb there's a primary
there's a primary situation more than merely living situation
that the sky is an expression of in the same way that
in very still water in daylight you see
you look down into the water and what you will see is what's above you
you look down to see above this is very profound the light on the water sacred
so one can imagine that perhaps and this is just i'm asking you to see as if what i'm saying is
interesting or useful rather than to to say that it is true but
we are born from the lips beneath a triangle that points at the earth
it's literally as if there's a terrifying noise it's as if the mother's pubic hair is a cone
and the top of it is open and the point we emerge from this point
when we are when we have completed the embryo genesis the process of conception and embryo
genesis we emerge from this point into terrestrial existence and so if the egyptians
were trying to have and i don't believe that the pyramids are merely tombs not by a long shot
but if they wanted
their rulers to be resurrected in the world of origin they would invert that triangle
and give it more dimensionality make it three four dimensional actually right because time
right so make it last in time and make it three dimensional rather than two because
as you go up to the sky the dimensionality increases and so in death
the pyramid focuses
the ruler's essence and what is this ruler thing it means measure
it means measure correctly and to measure correctly
is to have true eros your eros is true it's divine it originates divinely and it does it's un
un it cannot be
occluded and it cannot be adulterated you have true eros this is what the rulers have those
things they hold in their hands the rod and the crook that rod is for threshing wheat
those pharaohs they held the crook there's actually another word for the rod that's
escaping me at the moment
the child who approaches death in the hindu myth i got distracted because i met joe the child
what did i do with his card
the child approaches death and he is met by death's retainers
and in this sense death is an avatar in this hindu important crucially important hindu story and
um what is the child's name come on hippocampus connect me to the memory
and death has another name as well the child's father has been performing the fire ritual
but uh in sincerely so giving you're supposed to give away everything that's important
to the monks and his father's giving the sick cows and the stuff he doesn't really
want to keep anyway he's sort of performing it half heartedly and the child says to his father
who's the child's very precocious and he says um oh father i see what you are doing as you are
giving the things you don't want away and not the things you do want to whom will you give me
oh father and the father says i will give you to death in anger
i'm gonna have to pause here because there's a terrible machine noise in my path
it's funny you know i tried to look it up which i very rarely do because i prefer to exercise my
memory my relationship with namosini mother of the muses whom i adore
and know to be a being not merely a mechanical
concept from which our idea of recording things in the in the dead shadow of which we have this
idea of recording namosini memory is alive vital multi potent omnipotent
woman of myriad potencies
uh
it's so funny the um
the jehovah's witnesses the women who are manning the little stand were talking about
someone buying a commodity for thirty dollars that was worth a lot of money and they both
thought that was really profound which is the explicit opposite of spiritual value
irony i'm not um i don't mean to defame them i'm just noticing the irony i think you know
i love humans and all of our delicate confusions are amazing
um
so i went to look up the story about this child his father's doing the fire ritual
and he says oh father to whom will you give me and i'm probably telling the story very poorly
i think my son caught it from sarva priananda and told it to me and this is a very clumsy
version of it but nachikaida is the child's name which came to me when i failed to find it in
attempting to look it up and he goes to the avatar of death who has another name that i cannot
remember but nachikaida's name is more important i think and um the avatar of death is like a
position that one acquires through merit and through meritorious um incarnations right through
being meritorious in in a sequence of lives and along with this position come a broad array of
benefits yeah and the one thing that can deprive one of those benefits is to fail to receive a
brahman's child generously and nachikaida seems to know something of this because when he goes to
death's house he basically back in the real world we must imagine he is dead okay and this is the
connecting thought here he is dead right his he's you know his father says i will give you to death
um but he doesn't mean i will kill you he means i will give you to the avatar
of death or whatever i think and so nachikaida says okay i'm gonna go i will i will give myself
to death and dies and then goes and visits death and death is out on an errand or hunting or something
and his retainers invite the child in and say come let us uh nourish you and comfort you
and nachikaida says no sorry stubborn and intelligent precocious child no i will wait
until death himself arrives
and so he waits and i guess it's it's three days or something and then death comes and is very
disturbed oh my oh no why are you outside did not my retainers secure you and nachikaida says
oh you know they did their job they they offered you know they offered me comfort and refreshment
and i uh declined and death says uh because this is the one thing that if not amended could
deprive death of the boons and benefits um to which the inaction of his station
entitles him presuming you know the genders here um
or the gender is even important which in some cases we should imagine it isn't
at all um beings right don't have to have gender
when we say organism gender is not indicated when we say animal gender not indicated
in any case uh so nachikaida is very canny and death says well what you know i'll give you three
boons whatever whatsoever you may ask i'll give you and nachikaida says i and i'm not sure of the
order here but he says i want when i return to life i am saddened that i have upset my father
i'm saddened that i've upset my father and i want him to love me just as profoundly
if not more profoundly than before than before i upset him because i essentially
nachikaida knows what he did he kind of sinned against his father by revealing
the imperfection of his ceremonial intention and inaction of the intention
by revealing that his father was duplicitous in his intention he has shamed his father
so he asks for for his father to love him just as he did before this and he asks for the secrets
of the fire ritual the deep secrets that are hidden the occult secrets of the fire ritual
and then it's the third thing he asks for where we get to the connecting thought here
the third thing he asks for are the secrets of death
and this is the thing at which death recoils and death tries to
entice nachikaida with worldly before nachikaida even makes his selection
and this is very common when divine beings meet human beings often first they will praise the
human being oh you are a special one we deeply appreciate you you're amazing and that's why
we've come right so they will they will try to you see what's going on here this is very profound
they will try to inflate the sense of the personal identity right which is actually the
thing you want to that's the prison that you've already become trapped in and they try to make
that prison look very shiny and they're like oh darren you you stand out among all the humans
a shining example we have noticed you we have deigned to notice you
here comes the trap and the danger you are so beautiful so intelligent you are truly noble
all these just praises and compliments which when authentic are not it's not really a problem the
problem is when we become intoxicated by personal identity again we're in the tiniest
trap like portion of our humanity and our nature our spirit it's not darren that's interesting
it's when he gets out of the way what possesses him when he steps aside what beauties
what ancients what progenitors what spirits what gods what angels come when he gets off the stage
and makes his his incarnation a stage for virtuous intelligences and muses artists so
so death offers nautica to worldly acclaim which is the common offer what would you like what can
i give you you've you've caught our attention we will grant you wishes what do you want
and one of the most intelligent answers i've ever heard to this question came
i think pretty sure from my friend sara who i am not speaking with at the moment but um
i think it came from her she said something like could we preserve the question while we get to
know each other better because i don't even understand what's going on here like i don't know
know what or who or how you are and i'm not sure what or who or how i am in relation with you
so why don't we preserve that question would that be okay that's a really interesting answer that i
like a lot um in any case death offers you know you can have fame you can have power you can have
women castles you can have uh insight intelligence court courtly adoration
long life health the ability to heal people you can be psychic and nautica is like
all those things fade away those are impermanent i want my father's love
i want the secrets of the fire ritual and i want the secrets of death and death right you know
recoils again especially at the third one and says no no i don't think you understand and
nautica says oh i understand these are these i'm serious these are the three things i want
and death is like yes but even the gods are not granted the secrets of death this is the key
right here right this is the forbidden knowledge the secrets of death that's the forbidden of
the forbidden that's the most forbidden thing anything you know one of my friends uh nathan
was asking me the other day you know i just don't understand what you mean by forbidden
and i said it is it is as if you are in a cage
and uh anything that reveals how the cage was composed what what the that reveals the bars of
the cage to your awareness that reveals the history of the cage or that
gives you intelligence about the prison in which you find yourself ensconced
in your incarnate humanity those are the orbits of the forbidden knowledge
and death is the sudden and perhaps nearly complete
evacuation of the cages suddenly you're outside them you can see from outside
all of that knowledge seeing outside the um the traps of our incarnate waking consciousness
anything that leads us out of that is forbidden but the thing that fundamentally leads us out
of that is death and this is why you have like um i mean this is why you have initiation the
knowledge is protected because it's forbidden uh and this is why when you go for example to
meetings of ians right the international association of near-death studies and you hear
the stories of people who died or very nearly died you know everyone will say not everyone
some some skeptics will say for example um this bird doesn't know me
no some skeptics will say no one has died if you die you don't come back
well they're wrong about that i mean it just it's what part of what they're saying is um
if you don't carefully set where the cut in your consciousness is what you mean by death if you
don't carefully set that to mean that from which you don't come back then you're just that's not
really death but there's lots of people who's you know brains they were brain dead they were
heart dead they were not breathing they were dead they were out of their body looking down
into the operating room or whatever they were you know or they were in oblivion right some of
the people who've died and come back say there's nothing there there was nothing i have no memory
no nemosony right there's no nemosony over there
yeah this is the forbidden topic so imagine that in the ancient world death and resurrection
were fairly common and healing was associated with the capacity to resurrect dead people
as was messianism as was wisdom and this is part of what aman is implying if not directly stating
even though his um the pictures he paints are erotically profligate right there they're very
much about like sex orgies and you know intoxications and drug use and psychedelics mixed with snake
venom and the purple in your eyes made out of the substances that are unspeakable
but he's like a raging prophet when he starts talking this way and in a sense
he's saving us from the necessity of having to engage directly in such debauchery
um by somehow representing it in his tone and his errations and his cadences right it's very
profound you know later perhaps i may think other things but for the moment i'm quite grateful to
his um bizarre and wild spirit yeah the way he the way he shapes the mind
his music it's helped me see things i've never before understood and just to circle back to them
um we adore possession this is why we watch films we want to be possessed but there's
nothing good to possess us and so the religions are in a way saying like this is the best thing
to be possessed by this is the only thing to be possessed by be possessed by the spirit of truth
be possessed by the divine justice be possessed by the prophet be possessed by the one who the
prophet serves and only this one and no other possessions hilariously jesus says effectively
give up all your possessions by which we think he means our belongings and you know um
no man with a camel will pass through the eye of the needle the eye of the needle is a space
that lets you into the city after dark where it's a tunnel that's only wide enough to pass through
with your unencumbered body so that you cannot bring goods that can be exchanged for money
without paying tariffs into the city or out of the city at night it's a metaphor and it's probably
a metaphor in nine ways other than that one as well but there's another sense of it which is
be not possessed by anything other than the spirit of truth uh
yeah yes yes
there's so much more here to cover but i've managed to circle most of the crucial elements for today
um i'm so grateful to have traveled these paths in my own awareness thought and concern
i feel as if i've risen above the stations of my ordinary waking consciousness and
and my personal identity somewhat successfully today that's a precious gift for which i'm humbly
grateful thank you for joining me i wish you beautiful ways and paths and dreams and relations
adventures and fulfillments i look forward to learning again together for each other
very soon bye bye for now
