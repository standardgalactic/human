hello everybody welcome for the past couple days I've been holding my phone
and recording so that there's some video content and also so that people can
see my face if they wish to of course you don't have to and I keep my screen so
dim that I can't really see my face very much most of the time when I'm
walking and talking so sometimes it might be that it's not properly framed by
the camera or something like this and usually when I make recordings most of
the time I've just finished meditating and the meditation that I practice and
have been practicing for many years is Zen meditation perhaps it's particularly
Rinzai Zen that is the tradition where my practice of meditation originates
and in that tradition koans may be employed I fondly remember my teachers
all of the beings who have been my teachers and that's a lot of beings but I specifically
remember my human teachers and many animal teachers and some insect teachers and some
living place teachers today is Memorial Day we have some pretty strange and very abstract
traditions in our modern situation and having single days where we remember something or
we celebrate something is one of those traditions and I suppose that Memorial Day is intended
but who is intending it something is intended about it but who is the one intending it and
why are they intending it and how do they intend it is there actually any intending
going on or is it just a habit that keeps getting reiterated because we kind of don't
know what else to do or we're not very creative or we're dissociated we're busy paying attention
to machines and nonsense all kinds of things really that mostly don't have any meaning
so this is one of my teachers
she doesn't say anything in language to me and in fact I don't know what her gender is
and surely if the plant has a gender it must be very different from what it means for an
animal to have a gender or to be physically gendered and that's a quagmire that I'll
definitely avoid descending into today but I like the idea of remembering the sacrifices and
the beauty and the gifts of those beings who have been my teachers and many of the most
brilliant of them were not human though among those that were human my mother and my grandmother
and my father and my sister I remember that and there were some teachers I had in school
and there was Robert Aitken Roshi my first end teacher's teacher the lineage teacher of our
of the Diamond Sangha lineage and John Tarrant Roshi and Joseph Bobarrow Roshi and Daniel
Teregno Roshi though of those men it's Tarrant and Aitken who
stand out in my memory Aitken because he was my teachers teacher I did meet him one time
and Tarrant because he was my first teacher and I think he's a he's a settled ripened
American Zen teacher I could have that completely wrong it's been many years since I've spoken
with him mmm Aitken Roshi passed away I think around 2002 and Joseph Bobarrow was my teacher
for quite some time but I still thought of John Tarrant as my actual teacher even though I was
only with him a pretty short time but the animals that have been my teachers the dogs we had growing
up various pets various creatures that I encountered in the living world and plants too
cactuses and Venus fly traps epiphytes staghorn ferns African mask plant little peyote cactus
salvia plants all kinds of plant teachers that I've been very close with I remember them
and of course the people that I love my best friends most of whom I lost over time nearly
all of whom I lost over time eventually I did something or other that made them angry
those Cooper's Hawks also my teachers I miss my old best friends miles it's one of them in my
20s and Gary was another one and the girls Sutton and Emma Marla Willow and Damien Sutton's
boyfriend these people were like my family for a long time and before them I had another family
family of gamers Ray and Greg and Rich and Martin Andy four or five other guys we used to play
role-playing games and boy we were very tight the sun has been my teacher the moon has been my
teacher stars have been my teachers the sky the living places the ground I walk on everything
really is my friend my teacher even those beings who I might think of as my enemies
she paper caps on the ground kind you throw and they pop they have little stones in them
with some gunpowder in there pain has been my teacher pain of loss lost love lost relationships
lost hope lost meaning lost opportunities lost faculties pain has been one of my teachers
so has joy and the muses those who once drove my profoundly creative aspects
who these days are mostly quiet in my older age fact I dearly regret I'm a little concerned
for the innocent people walking near where the Cooper socks are it may be that they really
only have it in for me but I'm not sure about that and I'm not sure they exactly have it in
for me I think there was just some some miscommunication there between us for a while which hopefully
is no longer the case though I pay close attention to their signals now because they taught me to
tragedy has been one of my teachers I suppose on this day that we call in the United States
Memorial Day the idea is to remember those who gave their lives in war for us to have a country
it's a weird idea in a lot of ways though in some ways I can understand it
it just seems so tragic I've never I mean like many little boys who grew up in the
time I grew up we played war games and in fact later when I was a teenager and we were into
role-playing games we also played technical war games with miniatures we had naval battles
and tank battles and Starship battles all kinds of things and it was extremely fun to do these
things but nobody was being killed by our games when I was growing up the Vietnam War was in
full swing and had been for some time John F. Kennedy was assassinated the month before I was born
and I don't know a great deal about him as a person but as an orator he was exceptional
exceptionally profound orator capable of truly inspiring human beings to reach for something
beyond the traps we ordinarily find ourselves ensnared by and generally continue to build
and iterate and distribute I understand that people gave their lives in war time
in an attempt to defend something whatever that something may have been it no longer is
and what it is now is very fucking weird I mean deeply profoundly weird and I don't trust it
whatever it is I don't know what the United States is it looks like a mangled up mess of tangled
conflicted bizarre often toxic aggressive non-human agendas and imperatives and commerce and
spectacle and bullshit and dying and killing and rape I just looks like a mess to me and the
little portions of it that aren't and some of the traditions that aren't quite as toxic okay I
understand those you know to a degree but what we call education is not education what we call
society has nothing to do with being social our government is not a government it's an
atrocity exhibition and it has been for a long fucking time and I've heard people say yes well
you can say all these things but you live in the fact that you can say these things means you live
in one of the best places you can live all right I agree so it's not the meanest rapist on the block
but it's a fucking mess and it's terrifying and the people who gave their lives to preserve
something it was not this they hoped to preserve with their dying breath it was something noble
and beautiful about the potential of human beings to form and embody societies that were noble and
intelligent humane kind generous wise brilliant beautiful worth preserving
and this alas we have quite severely and severally failed to do whoever we might be in that sentence
now we live in a bad science fiction novel or a clusterfuck of bad science fiction novels that
are just ramming into each other with ever greater intensity to see which 73 of them come out close
to the top and can dominate the others or some crazy ass crap like that I have reverence for
those who gave their lives to protect something they imagined could be true or might be real
but I have at least as much reverence and probably more for the thousands of children that grew up
tortured by the insanity that our nation produces like poisonous milk and transmits to every home
in life and mind and I have reverence for the mothers and the fathers and the children who've
grown up here lived and died here often never really knowing what it means to be human or what it
could mean to be human because they're so trapped in a system of financial and commercial and vocational
slavery that they never see the outside of it in their entire lives and they live in little boxes
and they watch things on television because they don't have lives and they watch things on the
computers because there's nothing noble or interesting about their existence and they're dying
of loneliness and suffering inside and they're isolated and they're impoverished in ways but
before there was money it was impossible for people to become impoverished in these ways
I have reverence for them they've died in the war too it's just the different war
it's the war of the collectives against the living world and the humans
it's weird it's very deeply weird
but actually what I was thinking about today when I was after I was meditating we try not to do a
lot of thinking while we sit sauce in thoughts creep in it happens
but we try to just let them dissolve away and return our focus to breathing and the koan and
the meditation is very simple in this sense right it's not there's nothing elaborate about it
it's very simple just follow the breath with one's attention sink down into the
one's hara and the belly with one's awareness and from that hara breathe
perhaps follow the koan
it's a challenging practice for all of its simplicity
I love the hummingbird sage
there's some white sage there too which I also love and I love the blue sage I like all the sage
what I was thinking was
it might be wonderful if we use Memorial Day differently to remember what is important
for us to preserve and to remain aware of and to embody and to carry with us
and to give to one another in life as human beings as living beings as animals as beings
themselves as organisms as participants in the universe who are conscious and aware
of our capacities for participation in the universe to some degree
even if that degree is often cruelly circumcised by our culture and what we're exposed to and
what how we are imprinted as human beings in modern cultures and frankly I am terrified
for the children who are alive and who are children today at least when I was a child
we were not yet competing against photographs for our own survival data was not more important
than our lives we played outdoors we invented games we had some toys
and it was possible to have elaborate toys if you could afford them but there were no computers
in fact there weren't even calculators what we had were adding machines which were mechanical
pre-calculators and nobody paid much attention to those they didn't pop up everywhere you looked
you didn't have to carry one with you and have it tap you on the shoulder every 15 seconds
when some signal from somewhere mostly meaningless comes in to disturb what otherwise might have been
you know a mind
so I'm terrified for the children born today of course the humans are resilient and they
adapt but as they adapt too often very important faculties are sacrificed and become
tokenized and represented and sold back to us in broken forms because the whole inside us
that's missing where those faculties used to thrive it aches and we want something to put
there to stop that aching and even if I speak only for myself then so be it but I suspect many of
you will understand what I'm pointing at and so I think it would be wonderful if for Memorial Day
we would remember what it meant to be human what it can mean to be human and particularly
the incredible importance of memory to being human because whatever damages memory damages
everything else we can be everything we can be is founded on memory and this word also related
words like mnemonic which is a term that can mean an abbreviation but in computer science
can also mean an instruction I believe and the word meme me me
chasing off a red tail
you see right now it's nesting time a new generation is being born for the birds
and the cooper's hawks are very busy very intent very focused
on ensuring not just the safety of their young if they have them yet
but the territorial boundaries of where they nest and live
and I've never seen them quite this intensely concerned about it before
but I'm paying attention and it's important
so memory and similar words these words come from the Greek
term or name
mnemonic
let's see if I can spell this it's going to be tough
m
n e m o s y n e mnemonic
and mnemonic was understood to be the mother of the muses but the origin of all of the faculties
that human beings may enjoy because without memory what faculties will you have none
so memory is the primordial meta faculty
and when I was a child
long before I was a child Jules Verne wrote science fiction books
staggeringly prophetic books and one of them was 20,000 leagues under the sea
and this book was about a man whose name was captain Nemo
who is the nemocene's avatar right he's her protector and he defends the oceans
against the humans because the humans are so fucking stupid that they've decided
that the oceans are a good place to conduct their fucking wars
I'm not usually angry in my videos
but today I'm willing to be upset
so captain Nemo was one of my heroes as a child
he adored the living beings of the ocean and intended to defend them at all costs against human
incursion and devastation
and no not too many people probably ever recognize that his name comes from nemocene
there's a similar avatar that people haven't recognized
uh where his name comes from his name is Robin Hood
and I won't say too much about this I'll leave it to my intrepid listeners to understand but
he is the robin of the little hood and as such he comes before all other archers
and therefore none are his equal
so today
I'd like to celebrate memory
nemocene
nemocene
the faculties that emerge when our memories are vital and vibrant and are nourished
and developed in beautiful meaningful creative playful intelligent ways
if we're going to have a day called memorial day I do not wish to simply remember war
and as I was saying when I was a child
the Vietnam war was a constant and it was horrific and it was terrible
and all of the children knew that it was wrong and it was horrible
and that the humans the adults must be so incredibly stupid to do something like this
not just for a day or a week or a month for years on end to kill each other and burn down the world
for nothing for dumb ridiculous meaningless nonsense
almost all the children that were alive when I was little
we believed that war and environmental atrocity would have to come to an end in our lifetimes
and we might we agreed that we'd be willing to give our lives to ensure that happened
it didn't happen
we found the humans found new ways to make war
new places inside us to make war not just outside us
new machines new weapons new factories new atrocities
new horrors and new ways of hiding them
so let's remember that because those people who gave their lives did not give their lives
for this they gave their lives in hope of something beautiful and human and if they were
confused so be it but in their hearts there was something true that I respect not the wars
and the people who sign up to defend their country
I can't say something universal about that
but what I know
is that many of those who initially made that choice became involved in a religion
and either the religion was that the united states is good and true and great
or it started out that way and they figured out something more like what was actually going on
which was that the united states is full of shit and is lying and is making war for money
and for profit and for other deadly ignorant reasons
and there might be some shreds of truth in both perspectives I don't know
but I'm more inclined to the second one because the world is too delicate for us to continue to
make war it has to have an end
I mean we must bring it to an end we have to stop making war and make something at least vaguely
resembling survivable societies and collectives and intelligences and if we're not making that
there's no possibility of justifying war there's no justification for that kind of idiocy it's insane
and people will say things like yeah people will say things they'll say things like well
we have to make war because if we don't the other people will and so yeah that means that all games
are dragged down to the worst common denominator of the crappiest game that someone at the table
is willing to play now all games will be dominated by that that's not fucking survivable that is
completely absolutely stupid
stupid
all right time for me to get off my little rage boat for a moment and come back to memory
so all of this that you see in the background here all these trees and plants the sky the stars the
earth all these creatures all these organisms and all their relationships they are forms of living
memory they are the body of nemosity and we are expressions of that body and that our capacity
to form minds depends intimately moment to moment second to second instant to instant
on the diverse health of all of these living beings and the living places
yeah and as those collapse our minds collapse with them because they are the origins of our
minds moment to moment not just in long-term cause effect cycles though that way too
so when i have the intention to celebrate today memory nemosity i'm celebrating all beings
all the living places the universe itself the origins of time space there's nothing that isn't
memory there's certainly nothing meaningful that isn't memory
all of our technologies are actually can be understood meaningfully as
um concretizations of memory right the forks and knives in our silverware drawers
those are concretizations of the history of humans eating food
so really there isn't anything that isn't memory and it's not at war with itself in case you can't
tell right this is not a fucking battlefield do you see things exploding and attacking each other
and going apeshit crazy for the dumbest reasons imaginable here no you don't and neither do i
look how peaceful this is
these seeds i touch
you can see all the pollen
the beautiful pollen the living dust
it's so soft it's a magical substance that pollen i promise you rich with memory
the stuff we call dna are genes which humans still have but the slightest of understandings of
this memory
so let us celebrate this faculty this meta faculty from which all other faculties emerge
in all of its forms and kinds not merely the kind that we have in our mind where we remember
thinking or seeing or learning something um something conscious something cognitive but
also the memory that our bodies are that the living beings are
if we have respect and reverence for this it will continue to teach us and we can grow together
inside the living little bubble that we have here on this planet for the moment
but as the people and the collectives are destroying the ecologies they're ripping
the anciently conserved structures of memory apart and they're replacing them with pieces of
machinery and toxicity and death
and there will be an end to this behavior it may not come today but there will be an end to this
behavior so today on memorial day i remember war
but not with reverence with disdain i remember memory i remember mothers fathers children
i remember the animals i remember the living places
i remember beauty and learning and unity and communion
with reverence and hope i remember love
thank you for joining me i look forward to seeing you again soon
