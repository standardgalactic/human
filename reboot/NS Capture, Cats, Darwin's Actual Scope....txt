hello everybody if I had realized that I might be motivated to make a
recording while I was out walking today I would have brought something to screen
the wind and usually a cotton ball or even some facial tissue wrapped around
the mic with a rubber band something like this it's enough it works it works
fine for my recording setup
yeah I'm not going to talk about that all right so what is on my mind first of
all I am where am I I am at a lake it is very windy and no shame for any of you
who decide this is too much wind noise for you but those of you who are bold
can accompany me in this strange adventure where I am risking my life
primarily from widowmaker tree falls to get a little exercise on Sunday in the
midst of some really interestingly stormy weather lots of wind gusts
occasional bouts of serious rain but not the long slow calm kind of rain that is
often well less threatening when the minute when the wind picks up the
primary threat seems to be trees falling and where I live there's a lot of sand
actually that's ridiculous let me be more clear as I understand it most of
Golden Gate Park is a giant sand dune with some complex aquifers underneath it
so I guess long ago the humans imported a bunch of topsoil so to speak and spread
it all around and one of my friends well actually no longer my friend what ex
communicated me for let's see I had a tiny bit of a sniffle and I was outside in
the gardens without a mask on or no I had a mask on actually but as I wasn't
severely quarantining I guess my friend decided I was a bad man turned out that
it was less than tiny allergies that I was experiencing not even a cold and I
certainly wasn't getting in anyone's face so yes she once remarked you know
there's so many non-native trees here and they just don't form deep roots and I
thought I mean especially now it's very obvious to me that she having the status that we would
associate with a person of color particularly whose ancestry comes from India might have
been making a psychological right right a displacement or a projection in metaphor
without knowing it because what I saw we see a lot of trees fall here in fact I'm
looking at five or six that fell recently right now yeah there's a bunch of them wow
I mean it's you know it's literally dangerous to be out in weather this windy the secondary
danger for pedestrians is stuff going in your eye or being impaled on your umbrella but anyway
back to the tree things so my friend who excommunicated me is a docent at the botanical
gardens I think still and I would be surprised if she did not understand that you're talking
about a maximum of two or three feet in most places of topsoil sometimes less and then just
saying right so trees fall over I don't think it's because they're non-native right they fall
over they don't form complex root systems not because they're not native but because it's
pretty hard to do in sand right so yeah part of the funny part of the the trail here has been
cordoned off yeah I guess there's also being hit in the head by things that fall that aren't
branches for example pine cones and stuff or little pieces of branches that could wipe you out as a
human it doesn't take a lot of weight coming from the sky you know 20 30 feet above your head to hurt
you or even kill you especially if you're not wearing a hard hat so yeah lots of risks what's
the f-side well a couple of things one who as one gets older you start to have to pick more or
less explicitly between something resembling more adventure or something resembling more safety and
the more safety line is devastating in a bunch of ways because although you could handle maybe you
could handle box life without too much trouble a while ago when you start getting older the comfort
of box life begins to become reticent of the comfort of the grave so to speak metaphorically and so
one necessarily chooses and it's a choice that you make each day now it's similar with our minds do
we adventure or do we stay in familiar terrain and why and what what turns out to happen is it's a
bit like exercise if you don't if you don't keep it up it tends to oh wow there's a little yeah
see I just saw a branch fall that could have definitely hurt someone thankfully it was
slowish oh wow I just heard another one yeah it's like I'm out here and it's it's like I'm
hearing gunshots right except they're not gunshots they're tree breaks so it's probably good that trail
was cordoned off because I might have been stupid enough to go up there and I can tell from here
basically it's a bunch of cypress trees and these things naturally produce I think it's mostly
cypress and they naturally produce these long slender branches that are prone especially when
water soaked to just snap off right it might be some kind of you know evolutionary benefit or
something maybe maybe those branches both fertilize the ground as they as they fall apart or bring
other organisms or root possibly or maybe there's no you know obvious benefit if we're doing what we
might imagine is Darwinian accounting which brings me to a variety of topics I've long held to switch
to the topic of house cats that house cats are basically they can be understood from a
variety of interesting perspectives including that they are effectively ambient psychedelic
organisms meaning that if you begin to bond your mind with the mind of a provocatively intelligent
house cat rather than a really lazy one but even the lazy ones or it's like they're smoking opium or
something all the time um or rather they don't need to smoke anything the Cheshire cat in Allison
Wonderland is sort of an example of someone who has noticed the strangeness of the cats but I have
long held that in terms of intelligence and non-human intelligence and alien like not alien is in bad
alien is in family member from another origin right more like that yeah the house cats those are
like the square root of an octopus is a house cat you know maybe if you you know house cat to the
second or third power equals praying mantis or something like this and you know you can flip it
around the the intelligence of the ambush predators is very unique and profound and the
intelligence of a house cat which is a really peculiar an animal with a very peculiar history
developmental history very peculiar and trippy because it goes from being a wild alpha predator to
being a half domesticated beta predator like you know delta predator or something that effectively
causes its primary symbiont right captures a food source in humans trippy right very strange very
unexpected from some perspectives now of course the natural contrast to a house cat is the dog
similar similar developmental history and look cats aren't not pack animals they just
you know lions at least have what we call prides in English groups and are there other examples I
don't know there are probably examples of couplings and friendships but not primary necessary groups I
just don't know enough about the feline animals to know but there's at least one example of where
they form you know cohorts and pods and I imagine young lions and perhaps mountain lions and so
forth may certainly when they're young right they travel and hunt and play with their siblings who
knows if there's inter inter family activity of that kind I was talking to my friend Jay the other
night actually was last night and we were talking about this this topic and I love to wax enthusiastic
about the intelligences of the ambush predators because they are in a sense
like if you want security and familiarity dogs work beautifully right those are the
solar animal essentially of the pair and look there are solar cats and there are lunar dogs but
fundamentally the dog is the solar animal daytime predator right although not entirely you got
coyotes and wolves that are nocturnal maybe I had that wrong actually nighttime predator nocturnal
and similarly cats also nocturnal but perhaps more so than dogs tend to sleep all day stay up all
night left to their own devices probably I don't know what they would do in their natural situations
because I don't see those animals in those situations but I do think of dogs as solar
not explicitly and not only and cats as now there's going to be some serious wind
so we were talking about this the other night and okay what was the topic all right the topic was
actually pretty deep it was a topic that I've spoken of some recently but even since then the
insight has been enriched it's the topic of what happens when something captures the nervous
system of an animal and there's lots of stuff that capture our nervous system a simple example
of this is that you know it's the Pavlovian thing right if we smell something delicious in fact I'm
just I'm merely thinking of something delicious and my mouth is starting to water but if I smell
something delicious much more so that's an example where you can see that I have no control I have
no mental control over gale force winds just short of hurricane speed I have no control over whether
my mouth waters or not that I know of might be able to influence it with NLP or hypnosis or
something but I have no my salvation and similarly if I hear one of those gunshot branch cracks and
it's loud enough and near enough probably y'all jump when you see corvids at least around here
approaching food on the ground they will often sort of hop toward it and leap backwards I was
thinking a lot about that particular behavior the other day after observing it because trying to
understand one thing I can imagine now which it didn't occur to me before I mean it's not crazy
it's natural it's just different from the very safe norm that usually applies and the difference is
profound enough that I am well aware I could be killed it's not very likely but it's probably 50
times more likely than it was yesterday alright so the thing that occurs to me now and I couldn't
figure it out before but now it seems relatively obvious snakes eat birds and one of the best ways
to catch bird would be to hang out near the corpse of an animal right you're an ambush
predator you have that that feline intelligence that praying mantis intelligence that octopus
intelligence the jumping spider intelligence right you have this trap setting capable capable of
intelligence praying mantis is straight upset traps on flowers right just no doubt about it you see
them do it all the time so I wouldn't ambush predators and since corvids eat meat they eat
other stuff too they eat seeds and bugs and worms and stuff it depends on the birds and where they
are since they eat meat what might happen is a snake might or other ambush predator possibly
not sure what a bobcat maybe what else would eat birds I don't think I mean coyotes eat birds but
they also eat dead things snakes don't usually I don't know of any snakes that eat corpses now
you can teach cage snakes to eat dead mice I don't know if they eat dead mice in the wild not
it seems pragmatically effective that they should I just don't know but yeah I can imagine snake
hangs out near bird food of any kind dead things seed piles you name it and just waits for birds
and waits close enough that when the bird gets to the food item it's within striking distance of
the snake so that would explain evolutionarily how the peck jump back like it's literally like that
that song that has the lyrics jump back jack in it the bird like goes forward and then leaves
backward it may do that a few times and after like two or three times it'll it may just fly off
and leave the food alone that does happen I've seen it but what's going on there isn't that the
bird is thinking I'm scared I think what's going on is that the bird's nervous system has been
captured by something like an evolutionarily developed and look the thing may not be genetic
there's got to be nine other ways of influencing organisms that aren't merely genes and most of
those ways might we would argue would necessarily have some effect on genomes because they they
become selection variables in that theory and we're gonna get some weird stuff about that in a
minute so they might have so they might have selective functions so to speak or effect
but yeah what I think is going on is that the organisms nervous system has been captured and
like a goose that sees a ball rolled a few feet from its nest during a certain season it will go
the goose will crane its neck at least this is what I've heard crane its neck from research
crane it's not go toward the ball and roll the ball back into the nest whether or not there's
a ball there anymore at all and you know so you can see that there are these protocols you know
in the age of computers we would be likely to call them programs because we're just reaching
around for some metaphor but it's a historically physically structured vulnerability to capture
when an organism detects high heat suddenly it recoils it may recoil from other things water
food that may not be safe or smells wrong you know one kid on the bus disgorges his breakfast on
the floor now you pretty soon have what a oh this could be good just siren we might get a
demonstration of this effect let's see yeah pretty soon you've got you know
sudden unexpected public vomitorium on the bus right because once two more kids
follow suit and they're certainly not doing that on purpose right they're not trying to do that
they don't want to do that they can't help it so we didn't get the example I wanted so um
you can see that there's a structured response that's probably ordinarily rather than being
activated we can think of it both ways and we probably should rather than being activated by
stimuli it could also just be ordinarily inhibited and under some circumstances that
inhibition collapses and the coyote howls in concert with the approach of a siren not because
it wants to not because I mean possibly it's in pain it is possible we don't know and it's
reasonable to imagine it might be when you present
wildly exaggerated stimuli to an extremely sensitive organisms
to a hypersensitive organism right if a wasp can detect one molecule of a substance within a
two-mile range within a two-mile circle as I understand it some wasps are capable of that
sensitivity if you subject them to for example some kind of human perfume laundry soap for
example laundry soap stench could be physically painful to them so we don't know whether the
siren is physically painful but we do know that it resembles other coyotes calling and so when
the dogs howl and the coyotes howl at the siren there's a good chance that they're just being
triggered right their body is howling not their mind and you know we hear people talk about sensory
experiences like the hair stood up on the back of my neck I got goosebumps and obviously goosebumps
are a thing that happens when we're cold too but there are certain physiological transformations
heart palpitates right we like I don't know if we like it I think we like it because we're
our most of our experience is kind of dead but we like horror movies sometimes or we may like
scary rides because they
deprive us of the control we might ordinarily have over our body's sensations or the selection of
sensations right actively selecting sensations and subject us to extraordinary forces and sensations
so we too can be triggered
it would be interesting to see the library of programs so to speak they're not actually programs
I don't think but to see like the library of a single creature now obviously if you observe a
single creature very closely over time and you observe many of them many of their kind quote
quote you will begin to understand something of the library
so praying mantises for example
will they have a complex striking
behavior it's a prey capture behavior but they can use it like a punch as well
well and they have a complex threat display where their body transforms you know into
a creature oriented to both fight and shock a possibly predatory animal creature
so we were talking about the peculiarities obviously right like social media is weaponizing
this against us it one could say it is studying in a sense human reactivity
and then producing hopeful monsters that capture it amplify it
and make it contagious that's one of the dumbest uses of technology that anyone could imagine
I mean it's almost as dumb as just throwing bricks at people's heads the problem here is
that they can't see the brick it has the same effect in that they get dumber every time they're
subjected to it most of them some of them have a good buffer some of the humans
but yeah they get dumber every time like every iteration makes them dumber and
and
the problem there is really dangerous because anything that reduces your awareness or sensitivity
over time is prone to create a situation where you can't you won't be able to perceive what you've
lost and this is part of the problem with ordinary human aging one might argue that social media
ages certain aspects of us precipitously and invisibly
since our bodies don't age in response though I think actually internally they do we don't notice
anything that affects the thing you notice with right creates a really good
a really effective process that hides its own it hides its own progress and it hides the damage
it does it naturally does this
so we want to have awareness when we approach technologies or media
we want to have awareness of what's getting compromised how quickly how deeply
uh and how can we if it if it becomes necessary for some reason that we interact with the technology
anyway or if we want to we want to have the intelligence necessary to make determinations
about what that curve of harm looks like to whatever degree we are able and then adjust our
behavior accordingly so as to preserve the assets that would otherwise be lost
now you can see that the pros for example when they approach a food source on the ground
start to go at it and then jump back
they're testing to see if anything moves nearby the food during that process
and if it does they will become aware that the food is a trap
now obviously also once humans became tool makers of some kind they probably made bird traps too
of various kinds and so the bird is trying to check whether
you know probably a whether there's a organismal trap and b whether there's a physical trap even
though it may not its body probably isn't complexly differentiating between those two things
all right so triggering
I think even likely for an organism to take advantage of programs that are normally
let's not call them programs let's call them abilities
for or what do I want to call them
abilities
each organism seems to uniquely develop
of yeah this is this starts to run into problems between the difference between language and
description and what animals and organisms actually are and are doing or being
so imagine a broad spectrum of unique forms of sensitivity and or intelligence
that naturally result in
super effective like meta effective relational or physical
skills one can imagine that it might be possible for an organism to
especially for humans for example because we have a lot we have a great deal of luxury
compared to most animals in consciously determining our developmental spectrum spectra
so the humans we probably have access to at least probably thousands of
potentially developable abilities that result when enacted in something resembling either
relational or physical super function or both and one tends to lead to the other right because
for example
brilliant athletes who become known for their athleticism
acquire relational benefits what we call fame which radically increases
both their the opportunity space for reproduction but also for just enjoyment
unfortunately at the same time because of how strange the humans are in modernity and maybe
forever that will also attract enemies opponents undesirable possibly obsessive attention from
other humans and maybe under some circumstances from the sky itself
so my friend and I were talking about cats and she said something resembling you know
well i was talking about how cats can be triggered right if they
and that sometimes house cats dogs you can see dogs doing behaviors displaying
behaviors that and i guess i'm anthropomorphizing a bit that may be natural for humans or at
least some humans you know when a dog makes a silly mistake a silly physical mistake or like
it misses the bite or it slides chasing the ball it crashes into the wall or and by the way
that's you can see triggering right there because the dog ordinarily does not crash into things
but under circumstances where it becomes hyper focused on the ball it will crash in many dogs
will just crash into walls or other nearby objects
so
i have seen okay we're in gale force winskin dogs appear to exhibit emotions that resemble shame
and or embarrassment i'm granting that that's my interpretation
after after being witnessed
they seem to be aware of observation in a way not dissimilar to how we are
if i suddenly step on the side of my foot for example and begin to stumble because i missed that
the first problem is the pain in my ankle but the second problem is did anybody see me
you know i will quickly glance around to see if i have been seen to have failed at something
as simple as taking a step right
so i was i was explaining that it was my experience when i began to learn more about cats
because my girlfriend had a pair and certainly i encountered them many times before but i think
this pair of cats was the pair i was most intimate with him throughout my life
to memorialize them mexico and panther which who was her son
the mexico cat was a very hyper intelligent sensitive loving soft mother cat very fluffy
furry white found in the desert with a piece of her tail missing as a kitten i think if i remember
right and panther was one of her children big black fluffy cat and panther would when we were
playing occasionally and i've seen other cats do this very few of them won't be triggered if
you accept the gambit so this is this is a gambit in animal chess called cat belly when dogs give
you their belly it may or may not be submissive but it's they're they're showing their vulnerability
because their primary powers as an animal are
the primary powers are like a spear in a dog they lunge and penetrate
um the cat is different it can lunge but it normally attacks with paws because those are
razor sharp and grippy and once it gets a grip then it can penetrate usually the neck of a creature
often the neck with jaws both animals have bone breaking jaw power uh the cats is less
because it's smaller the house cat anyway um but what what she was saying i was saying that
basically sometimes i would pet panther and he would you know roll over on his back and this
seemed to be an invitation for you know some gentle aware belly petting um gentle and aware
both because you know this is an animal's vulnerable underside and previous experience
had taught me that under certain conditions cats become triggered and when they are triggered
they may bite unintentionally and usually they can manage the force so that it's not really bad
but still painful um and they also can uh there's some word for this it's not worry that's what a
dog does it's some kind of shredding thing they basically um grasp with their front paws and
may claw with them and then shred or gash with their rear paws and so what would happen is i'd
be petting panther we'd be having like a love session and you know he really he really enjoys
that but then sometimes he would get triggered and capture my hand bite it and try to rip out
it with his back claws and then he would he would sort of snap out of it and display signs of that
interpreted as sadness shame embarrassment i didn't mean to do that this kind of thing
and uh it took me a long time to understand what was going on i certainly didn't understand
to the degree that i you know in anything that resembles what i'm saying now i was unconsciously
aware but not cognitively and conceptually aware of what was going on i didn't have a model
but i did learn very quickly that when cats show you their belly it's either one of two
things usually going on either they really will enjoy the intimacy and danger of allowing
it effectively a god right an animal that is unimaginably powerful compared to you
you can kill a cat probably just by crushing its rib cage in your single in the grip of one hand
right you can kill it if you wanted to kill a cat hopefully you don't
it would take very little effort on your part to destroy the animal
physically and there's very little the cat could do about it so and the cat may not know
your physical strength but it probably suspects it from examining you
so when the cat rolls over either
it has learned to inhibit the triggering that is likely to happen when you approach its belly
with your hand and begin stroking it and so it just enjoys the ecstatic feeling
of being vulnerable like being loved where one is most vulnerable so to speak in human language
but other cats and again look the cat rolls over and displays its belly so something's
going on there but it's not necessarily my friend was saying a display of submission
or you know because when the cat is on its back all 20 of its face knife footraisers
are accessible and the bite and so now
it can grip with its fore paws bite
and shred with its hind legs
and this is a for for many animals I suspect this is a disemboweling move right it opens up
first of all just opens up gashes on the animal if you're a large cat
if you're a small cat it still messes them up
so yeah we had a big laugh because she was like the cat rolls over and people think it's a submission
move because they've been watching dogs or something it may or may not be partly submissive
but basically the cat now has full access to all of its weapons
it's almost like the cat is saying like the cat is daring you
right do you want to put your hand in the chainsaw
it's like a Tasmanian devil in Looney Tunes I just rips things apart
so I thought that was hilarious hilarious take on
on cats but if you want non-ordinary experience
if you're someone who seeks that the best place to seek it is in
a devoted contact with the living place with specific animals and birds
specific plants you know it doesn't matter whether plants have spirits or plants have minds
they are organisms and we are organisms and we are organisms from the same world
so in one set of categories that makes us the same thing the same being
we are that that tree is me outside my body I am the tree outside its trunk
and I'm not saying this is a fact but it is categorically true before even we are organisms
we are beings so it goes like the concentric circles go like mystery universe then beings
then organisms and earth organisms and then you know on down the line to animals human animals
and that's just what if what if our category tree is missing three important elements and I would
argue it is so that we can't even see them in language there's no way to detect them in concepts
because we have no placeholder for them in our categorical libraries
and I think actually this is a huge problem for all humans
but particularly for we who speak English because our category tree
is it's almost like it was hit by a shotgun or something it's missing big chunks of crucially
important placeholders shelves containers so forth that would draw our attention to modes of existence
that we no longer have a placeholder for and so since we don't most of those modes get
they get exported to the supernatural the psychic the superstitious the religious but
they shouldn't they don't need to be the actual situation is so weird that it's weirder than
all of supernatural speculation it's weirder than all religious speculation it's weirder than all of
science so none of those should become the authorities of identity those are conceptual
frameworks right you might argue one might reasonably argue that humans are particularly
vulnerable to structured reactions that are not necessarily physical but are similarly involuntary
and are conceptual right what would be an example well
well weirdly I was listening to the most enlightening podcast last night on I think a
philosopher called Dugan that it is in thought that it is thought or Durgan that it is thought
influenced influences Putin's policy dramatically
and for the first time I heard
powerful criticisms of the concept of liberal being liberal
so yes where was I going all right
examples of such cognitive traps are the Christian belief that everybody who doesn't accept Jesus
going to hell and that there's a Satan now
similarly the doctrinal liberal belief
once it becomes doctrine once you have to either be liberal or fascist
the liberal belief that you get to invent your identity you get to invent your gender
you are free to completely dispose of all conventions and anyone who doesn't dispose
of these conventions is evil particularly if they do not dispose of them in the way that you
dispose of them now you have sectarian liberality right and this can become extremely dangerous
virulent and compelling for humans we
adopt programs from not tradition but traditional language and the traditional
presuppositions about identity meaning and value also which games are played
that are imported when we learn a modern language particularly in my case I can speak
only telling me about English okay
so wow it's interesting
I've walked around the lake I think I'm on my
third circuit I'm sure you heard that sound that sound was the sound of a spear falling
from a cypress into the ground a foot from me it was pointed straight down it was pointy on the end
it stuck into the ground and it had a cone on it it was small but
uh had I been struck by that likely I'd have been injured possibly seriously
so it's probably time to stop the adventure but I'm not going to just yet because the sun has
come back out and there's a break in the rain and it's a good time to stretch my legs I think
of course I could walk in safer places
that startled me so I branched and thought
yes so the humans are vulnerable okay when we learn a language like English a bunch of games
are imported like courtroom mind or war mine or mine and yours or us and them
now us and them exist in most languages and conceptual frameworks
but the way the particular character of the English the modern the colonial the neo-colonial
the para-colonial you know what that is it's probably crashing it's tree branches snapping
yeah scary yeah be careful uh there I've seen branches fall on the path it's very very windy
it they can kill you I'm not saying don't walk I'm out here walking too but just be aware because
it is yeah yeah yeah but I almost got hit a moment ago by like a spear that stuck in the
ground and it was like a foot from me so be you know be aware those those cypresses they naturally
drop large branches so on that side you're at risk around this side not so much yeah okay my pleasure
yeah there were some gunshot branch cracks
all right I keep getting distracted but thanks for bearing with me those of you who have
hopefully I'll give you some uh some juicy morsels here um all right so
so
complex array of what I would call malware comes packaged with English and it's not
actually it's not in the language
per se the malware isn't necessarily in the language
the malware is packaged in metaphors models of identity meaning value relation function
um
efficacy and basically good and evil that come from the cultural or anti-cultural right the malware
traditions that
influenced how we tend to utilize the language together particularly today and over say the
past two three hundred years um the malware package that's attached to languages evolves
over time along with the language it's not clear that the languages contain malware rather it's the
suppositions underlying their deployment and particularly their deployment um beyond the
personal like the person-to-person environment in the larger social and
and disease riddled cultural
dumpster fire that is you know modernity
back into the gusty winds but not too dangerous here
so there's no trees likely to drop a branch on me near me
all right so
recently I've been listening to people like David Berlinsky and actually there's a primary
author whose name I can't remember but also
um a man whose name I'm going to mispronounce David Gilertner and if you want to find one of the
things I listen to um just search on mathematics and Darwin and okay so Darwin's book was called
The Origin of Species it is by it is you know he was the Einstein in a sense of biology
in that he gave us a map that appeared to be valid and explanatory for a broad range of
uh observable phenomena um and doctrinally
it is canon to oppose it in any way is to earn broad denigration attack insult
and this is unfortunate because science should never be about doctrine
science should be about discovery
and logical rational thought it should not cater to biases or presuppositions
in fact it shouldn't cater to anything but the facts and an ever improving description
of the relationships between them that we observe obviously this involves explanatory
manifolds so intuition and suppositions about identity function
distinction and and you know the scientific method is fundamentally disseptive so it tends
to break things down into parts and then examine relationships that by itself can be an error
but um
nearly every biologist believes well maybe that's not true many many modern biologists believe that
a moment
that the book entitled the origin of species
does in fact tell us how species arose
and so is generally accepted as an origin of life argument tells us how we got species from
the origin you know organisms now it doesn't make any I don't I don't actually know the
book well my doubt explains about origin of life because that's still quite mysterious
even though the mechanical physicalist
eliminative materialist version is either soup you got a complex soup on earth that
eventually produced cells or you know RNA and then there's some you know leaped from RNA
to cells and DNA and bacteria and protists and archaea and so forth
but nobody knows how you get from chemistry to life there are precisely zero successful models of this
uh lots of people have speculations some of those speculations the belief is generally
and what is taught is that life is the mechanical result of the combination of chemicals
and forces on earth
and a number of scientists who are not trying to import god into biology
are making the claim for intelligent design by falsifying something resembling
Darwin's blind watchmaker claim
i.e okay so the one of the old proofs of the existence of god was the unimaginable complexity
of organisms now our human experience of that complexity and our cognition about it has changed
quite a bit over many years
particularly since Darwin and has been influenced by a bunch of doctrinal garbage
that really has nothing to do with it but a long time ago someone possibly bacon
argued maybe it was Francis Bacon i don't i can't remember
argued that the existence of organisms proves the existence of god because
if you were walking along a if you were walking along a path in the forest
and you look down and you saw for example
i'm going to use a sort of weird example a colander
right
or a knife
i'm using a very simple physical object a knife you would not presume
be very unlikely for you to presume that the knife had been produced by the accidental combination
of substance and forces
there are certain kinds of objects
that naturally to our intuition imply a mind was involved in creating them
and fundamentally these objects can be said and in some cases blatantly obviously do
they can be said to encode information
so for example
dna is a digital data storage and propagation machine if we think in those terms i don't
but i'll use the language common to biologists of my day they tend to think as the they think
they think of cells and organisms as machines which i think is hilarious i get what they mean
um they don't mean diesel engine they mean
a structured process that causes the transformation combination and distinction
of various substances and structures over time
i mean something resembling that i don't think of them as machines but we'll use the language so
where was i the machines
there are precise precisely zero instances we know of
of where complex ordered information was produced without a mind
the biologists are presuming
unjustifiably that the cell is such an arrangement there is no evidence for that in fact
if we do the math these scientists argue
um i think one of the guys wrote a book that might be called darwin's delusion
and by the way what they're saying is effectively this
darwin got the theory right for downstream transformations of genomes mutations
changing parts of an animal from you know a bat wing to a bird wing or something
all right um mutations that don't wipe out the organism and we'll get to an interesting feature
of that in a minute so the scientists that are questioning this and look we don't have any good
arguments for origin of life panspermia is a change of arena right that's a rhetorical fallacy
you just move the you move the question elsewhere without supplying any useful further information
about it right um because you have the same problem with panspermia that you have with
origin of life on earth if life traveled here from elsewhere it had to begin somehow
and so it either began on a planet like ours or it began in an interstellar space or
it began somewhere maybe something we don't even understand you know again
the origin of life could be so profound that the concepts we presently rely on
uh
are insufficient all right um though the scientists rarely argue this
so what they're saying so first of all we have no good explanation for the origin of life
many biologists believe that it's essentially a mechanical accident there's no evidence for
the involvement of an intelligence uh the east scientists believe that there's no evidence for
the accident in fact they cite mathematical analyses of for example the probability of
accidentally producing what um a useful protein i think is the example they gave
i can't recall if they were examining for you know an amino acid or what specific
um biochemical element they were they were speaking of but i think what they said
is that the chances of producing a useful protein by accident okay the search space is
something like one in ten to the seventy and that's just one protein we're not talking about
you accidentally produced an organism um that resembles the probability of being able to locate
a single point particle say uh proton single proton in a search space nine like as large as
nine of our universe as we presently understand it the chances of you might as well call it
it says if you want to say it's impossible i'm on your side if you want to say it's
improbable i'm on your side but let's be clear it's monumentally probable
and you know something i've argued for probably almost 20 years is that the complexity of the cell
radically defies anything any explanation that the humans can come up with at all
and this has turned out to be prophetic in that every 10 years or so
the complex as the complexity as the apparent complexity of the cell expands for our science
perhaps sometimes geometrically the possibility of explaining it recedes with every expansion
um and it recedes at a similar pace right it's like you thought you knew what was going on you
now found out there were 10 trillion variables you weren't including your chance of explaining that
mostly just disappears into infinity
um
you know in my perspective uh i think our physical theories are insufficient to explain biological
phenomena and their origins and their meanings and almost certainly their purposes which of
which reproduction is not you know in the physicalist lexicon that's the crucial thing to do
there's probably 900 other things they're doing and there's certainly 15 of those that are
or nothing like what we suppose if you actually observe organisms with an open mind
you're going to discover something that generally defies description
it's not there for description for the purpose of humans describing it there's nothing to do
okay what the heck is this it's an artificial rock
i don't understand oh i see it's a rat trap it's a rat trap that looks like a rock
wow humans are crazy
hmm
i think i should visit my friend the tree
so
the scientists are in question here are very upset that textbook biology and the
the broad scale supposition of mechanical accident has origin for life
a proposition for which not only is there no evidence or nearly none
if we run some of the analytic math so that we come to understand
what the actual probabilities we we should be looking at are at this phase in our understanding
the math points in the direction that unless unless something really strange here happened
unless you hit the lottery you know unless you won the lottery
9 000 times in a row like you you won almost every time you played there's no chance
of producing not not never mind organisms just RNA DNA the complex protein synthesis apparatus
cells all of these things or not no chance but an unimaginable almost infinitely
unimaginably small chance literally you know zero
with a bit you know i don't know 5 000 decimal points after it and then a one
so uh i looked up the author
although perhaps burlinski has collaborated with him stephen meyer
they have some essays and books the deniable darwin darwin's doubt
and i suspect they also make arguments that darwin himself doubted
that his theory was any explanation for the emergence of organisms on earth or
for the poorly defined idea of species
so it turns out that the origin of life arguments that are doctrinal are mostly nonsense
uh it's not that they're that it's entirely impossible that the emergence of life on earth
was a purely mechanical accident it's we have the actual problem you know minus uh the supposition
of god in the original argument that if you find something finely articulated and what could
be more finely articulated than a blue jay it makes i mean just at it at the level of its cells
its 900 magnitudes of complexity beyond any machine we've ever built a single cell
staggers the the computational complexity of the entire history of humans doing math
and it does that over the temporal space of like 10 seconds or maybe even one and we're talking
a single cell so you have a cell either hyper structure like a blue jay or a raccoon you're
looking at something that is pure science fiction there's no chance of something that
sophisticated and agentive was produced by accident at least not in any way that we can
presently propose
when we find in nature extremely complex objects invariably
they are the produce of minds with zero known exceptions so it's it's sort of the opposite
of the problem we have with um sorry i'm getting battered by the weather
it's the opposite of the problem we have with the technical probability of there being life
on other planets technically
due to how statistics and probability function if you have only a single
example of something
you have no chance of determining the probability therefore the probability is
is stated as zero so until probabilistically according to how we use statistics and probability
um there is zero probability of life on other worlds because it's unknown you have no data
all right with no data you can't produce a probabilistic estimate there are other ways
to estimate the probability intuitively we are very unlikely to believe that
in a universe as vast as ours this is the only planet with life that life we would have to
believe that life cannot spread from solar system to solar system or that there are no
mechanisms for that transfer to take place because if there were especially if there were fast
methods um something possibly shell drakes morphogenic fields might represent
a sort of layer in in the universe or in time space in which once you manage to get an organism
on one world somewhere in time it's now vastly easier to get it on another one
um I doubt any of these scientists are fans of sheltering meaning burlinski,
alertner, and mire
but what I'm what I'm getting at is it could be that there are features of the everything
and I prefer that term or really the every one thing way all nests there are features of the
grand unity that we don't know anything about and could easily I think could reasonably possibly
set up a network between planets where information is transferred either at incredible speed or
instantaneously there might be forms of fields capable of doing this but this is my argument not
there's um what is their argument so their argument is that if you take the entire biospace
of organisms that we believe have ever existed on earth this includes you know bacteria viruses
the whole thing everything that number is something like 10 to the 40
if you then divide the search space 10 to the 70 by the number of chances you have
to produce say one useful protein
you're left with I don't know 10 to the 30 or something
um which is effectively no chance it means that over the history of life on earth there wasn't
time to accidentally assemble a useful protein uh unless something was going on that we don't
understand and this inclines them to believe that that the explanation of intentional terraforming
was vastly vastly more probable than this was a mechanical accident you got some chemistry together
you got some forces together out pops organisms that make unimaginably complex proteins and you
know RNA DNA mRNA all of these things right uh that stuff just pops up you know on a roulette wheel
all right just keep spinning the wheel long enough out comes archaea
so yeah wildly unlikely
whatever Darwin showed us it wasn't how species originated a really good grasp on
certain features of of biology
mutation selection all this but nothing for how species arise right how do you get a different
animal from a prototype we don't know and it's very unlikely to be accidental
so it turns out there's another problem
which is something like the incredible amount of wind and rain pounding into my face at the
moment no i'm kidding um there's another problem with where the kinds of mutations that would
give you a different animal from a prototype animal have to happen early in blastogenesis
i might have that wrong but they have to happen fairly early
in the process of producing an organism from oocytes right from from egg and sperm and so forth
um although uh the language is more complex than what i'm when i'm presenting here i'm not sure
a sperm is a i think there's a different word for the sperm uh so you have to produce a mutation
early in the process to get a different animal and if you produce mutations early in the process
what you get is a dead animal like if you make any mistake early in the process it's invariably
fatal so if you get an early mutation they said like someone said it was probably um
an alert I think he said you know you have like 19 tails or way too many organs that don't fit
inside the animal or you leave out like it doesn't make blood right something fundamental goes sideways
and the only way to get different animals that we know of that we can imagine
is mutations early in the in the process of generating the animal
again those mutations tend to be fatal so you can't use mutations early in the process
and late in the process later in the process doesn't produce different animals it produces
different traits so effectively if I understood their argument there's no space
in the developmental arc of an organism that we can understand
that would allow a mutation to produce a new animal so how do you get stuff like the Cambrian
explosion it looks like on earth we have something rather than um gradual meticulous evolution of
animals which I think was long held to be the likely case we have sudden like pulses
of unexpected diversification blossoming of myriad species myriad different organisms
and that certainly isn't explained by anything we have no idea
how you get I mean I have some propositions about this I would argue that um
it's probably it could be helpful very helpful to look at the organisms of earth as a single
organism an organism that naturally diverges from its origins or naturally enacts its original
what
naturally enacts its original endowments and propensities by diversifying
um that leaves me challenged to the same problem that any biologist would be challenged with which
is explain the the mechanism that produces the diversification we have no explanation
so we go back to the problem of you find a wrist watch all right you find something as
complex as a wrist watch and by the way let's be very clear a cell is I don't know 10 to the 900
times more complex than a wrist watch so you find one of those
you know imagine I don't know imagine you're walking around on a
on a new planet
and you find what I don't even know a hyper computer the size of a pinhead
you discover that there's these little pinhead like crystals on the ground
when you examine them you determine that they're hyper computers they can warp time
you can do all kinds of impossible things
and you decide oh the universe must just have accidentally produced these
like the possibility of accidental production of an organism is so much more remote
than the accidental production over wrist watch
there's no chance there's no way we could understand
how such complexity could be accidentally produced in the time frame we suppose now
if you know it's not even clear that the universe has been around long enough to do that
not not clear enough to me given our estimates of its age and presuming that what we're thinking
about is time is even relevant at the scale of the universe which it may not be could be
totally some other property that governs that and possibly most likely one we have no concept for
all right so what else what other problems so many problems
there are still people who believe and do science around the supposition
that it's a mechanical accident and it's reproducible we can figure out
how to produce the mechanical accident in the lab and thus produce life forms from forces and substances
the hubris implicit in the
suppositions
of the materialists
and those who
unjustifiably
presume that no intelligences were involved in the production of the intelligence with
which they examine the question it's an accidental you know it's an epiphenomenon right
of the nature of time space planets and stars right they just accidentally produced these
minds there's nothing mind like in them there's nothing metamind like there's nothing transcendent
in them and it's an entirely mechanical process unguided by anything right it's just not the
only thing that guides it are in some way the forces which would be you know chemical bonding
properties chemical transformation properties gravity electromagnetism strong force the weak
force etc etc seems unlikely to me so that's been a fascinating i never really believed that
to be honest i never supposed
i didn't trust the doctrines
i can sense dark doctrines and sort of smell the stink of them in various branches of science
and philosophy and i tend to be uh i let's just say i have great antipathy for them
in my own view there are a variety of intelligences
i don't merely suppose that intelligences were involved in the composition of organisms i take
the claim much further it seems very likely to me that something beyond intelligence was involved
probably in the construction of time space because you have a similar problem there right
which is the fine-tuning problem and it's a huge problem now there is one way to
sort of what's the right word there's one way to account for the fine-tuning problem
that's a little strange but interesting to mention it is that you have a sort of a popcorn machine
right but instead of producing popped kernels of corn it produces universes and most of those
universes are not viable the forces don't interact quote unquote properly or in such a way as to
what what is meant by viable is achieves extent in time
so
you keep bubbling these universes up from some universe progenitor field okay
and the non-viable universes mostly quickly dissolve and only the viable universes persist
so you will naturally if you find yourself anywhere if you find yourself at all
you will find yourself in a persistent universe otherwise you won't have a self to find or find
with and this is sometimes offered as an explanatory
an explanatory prosthesis
for
for the strangely perfect you know the goldilocks universe
and the goldilocks solar system both right because you have to have both you can't have a goldilocks
universe i mean you can't have a goldilocks solar system in a non-goldilocks universe so
in this model something just keeps producing nascent universes and some of those turn out to be
viable and you will only have minds and bodies and organisms in those that do therefore that you
know sort of explains the the existence of the fine-tuning problem what was myers objection to
that it was kind of brilliant i know he was using someone else's objection
i wonder if i can recall it
i don't think i can but yeah i find this fascinating and brilliant because these
are serious scientists they are not theists even though one of them might be religious
maybe a couple of them are i'm not sure but they're not attempting to import god
right they're not trying to sneak god past your scientific nose they're saying look
the complexity we're discovering here cannot have been produced there's not enough time to have
produced even some of its more basic features in terms of the age of the earth now i could see
that someone could say produce the features off world somewhere import them to the earth and then
things go along fine i can imagine that line of argument but you you you may have the same problem
elsewhere what's the actual lifespan of a planet presuming that that's that life only
occurs on planets which is something i don't presume since i don't know where life originates
i i tend to be open-minded and speculative about that but yeah we've got a huge problem with the
origin of life on earth in modern science the problem is steeped in doctrine the doctrine
makes no sense never made sense similar to the move to evacuate the universe of meaningful
intelligences right because we were we were science was so busy trying to get rid of god
that it threw everything away it just decided no it's all it's all just mechanics dude there's no
there's no evidence of any kind of um there's no evidence of any kind of intelligence versions
of what we used to call the ether which probably got replaced by
the the the the the propensity of time space to curve around mass to become curved at at at
complex structure and now more than like there may be forces that we don't know about too
right i mean i'm quite sure there must be constants and forces that we haven't discovered
that might naturally mechanically produce life but we can't argue for the existence of those
until we have some evidence of them and we can't make arguments that this the complexity we're
seeing just plopped out of a roulette wheel there's no real chance of that being true as far as i can
