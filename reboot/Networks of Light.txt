morning everybody so there's something I'm not going to be able to show you with a
camera but I can talk about it and it's a phenomenon that's happening right
here on the ground mostly they're not merely on the ground and the sun is
rising and I want to share something that I learned from watching small birds
hunt insects and gardens because right now there's a phenomenon on the ground
that's really quite astonishing there are there's an incredible network of
travel strands from spiders who've recently traveled over this area and
there's hundreds of strands between the leaves on the ground and they are
scintillating in the sunlight so if you were an ant above you there'd be these
strands of light right flashing back and forth in the daytime yeah really bright
like moving stars and there'd be this vast network of them and the camera in
the smartphone cannot resolve this phenomenon the video doesn't capture it
you have to be a living eye right but the thing that I wanted to share was you
could walk all around this phenomenon all around this tree right and from
nearly all the positions you'd see nothing but there's sort of a range of
angles both vertically and horizontally in which an invisible universe leaps into
being before your vision and tiny motes little insects are shining like stars
from this one angle but from the other angles it just looks ordinary and it
truly astonished me when I discovered this I've never forgotten it but
sometimes it slips my mind because this is how our minds are right there are
angles from which hidden universes emerge into our direct like felt emotional
sensorial access much like this vision phenomenon but it's very difficult to
stumble into them sometimes it takes practice or passion or crisis or but
most of the time most of the world is hit because we've been trained to seek
the angles but don't light up most of what's really there but can only be
seen from a very intimate angle of relation and the way we are in our
purpose our purpose with our minds our purpose with our senses and if the
purpose is wonder there's an infinite abundance of truly miraculous experience
and relationships and intelligence all around us at every moment but if you're
much like me most of the time I'm in this kind of prison-mind thing that's
largely a cultural imposition contagion
don't usually make videos in the morning but the the web phenomenon just
completely woke my heart right I see these glistening strands everywhere and
I've seen them before and I know this this is something this is kind of one
of the little secrets I know about nature those strands aren't merely spider
webs they're moving light in networks on the ground something's going on there
that's way more interesting than the common human you know oh those are just
spider webs you know and spiders use them for this blah blah now that's not the
beginning of what's going on
Sun is rising and maybe you can see my reflection in front of the tree where the
bees live and have almost always lived behind me
it's a little bee tree
perhaps if we recognize this we can learn yeah how at least to explore the
accessible angles of perspective and purpose and relation that are so
fundamental to our minds that determine the kinds of imaginings and ideas and
knowledge that the minds we have structured are capable or not capable of
participating in just paying attention to the local wildlife the yellow jacket is
not particularly fond of coffee thanks for joining me good morning
