Hello everybody, thank you for joining me.
I've just found some tracks, probably coyote tracks in the moist earth and I was following them.
Though I'm not a trained tracker and I'm not very skillful, I can still learn things
from the animals and plants, their activities, what they pay attention to and when, times
of things, places.
Today, when I came to the garden, I was planning on getting some sun and the blue jays here,
we know each other well, we are friends and in a sense, in order to get to know them,
one could think of it in different ways, but I brought something to share with them,
something that would be valuable in their world, something that they could recognize as a gift.
And we've been friends for quite some time and they teach me things,
if I'm paying attention, but they also learn from observing me, so we learn together.
And they've seen me meditating on a specific bench that I like and they often hang around
while I'm doing that, even though they're aware, in some way, that this is a time of stillness for me.
I remember once, I think the boy flew right past my head while I was meditating and I
could feel the wind from his wings, almost as if he were about to land on my head.
But they hang out with me and then after a while, of course they're in time in a very different way than I am
and this is the astonishing, one of the really astonishing things about being alive together,
is that in the place where we might think of as being the between of us, in the between,
the space in between us, not just the physical space, the relational space, it becomes enriched
and their way of being in time meets with my ways of being in time
and in that between, new forms of time are born and expressed that are a sharing of our different temporalities.
When we think about the idea we call life span and we think in metric time, seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, years,
we can become confused very easily by these ideas so that we think that a second is always the same amount of time or a minute
and mechanically it's not untrue but it's insufficiently true because machines aren't living beings and don't experience anything
so one mechanical minute is an empty thing, it's empty of being, it's empty of relation, it's the kind of time that throws everything away before the measurement is made
and by everything I really mean a lot.
So you know a small bird has a different life span than me but it's also in time in a very different way
an ant is in time in a way that's different from a flower or a plant or an herb or a tree or a whale or a bumblebee or a hummingbird
a turtle is in time in a very different way than a bat
and we can imagine that there are these forms of living time that are embodied in the living creatures
and all of their myriad relationships and the endless dimensions of between in those relationships
where new kinds of time, meaningful embodied relational time are shared
so today when I took off most of my clothes to get some sun and sat down on the bench where I sometimes meditate
I saw a new behavior to me in one of the Blue Jays
it went to the ground near a bush in the sun and it sort of cleared out a little hollow in the bark
and then it fluffed up and spread its wings out
and it was a very surprising thing because I may have seen this before but I certainly don't recall it
and what it was doing was sunbathing
and its sun bathed only for a few minutes and I could tell it became very warm
because when birds become warm they often help to cool themselves by opening their mouths
and so after seeing me take off my clothes and sit down on the bench
the Blue Jay who is my friend apparently decided that's not a bad idea
I think I'll have some sunbathing too right now with my human friend nearby
and we can sunbathe together
it's so beautiful
it's like we might imagine with our critical adult intelligence that it's like a children's story
and I was quite enchanted by this sharing of sun time together
I've never seen them do that sunbathing thing
it may be that they do it somewhat regularly and I've never noticed
but they've never done it around me
and it's no accident
it's no mere coincidence
that when my friend the bird saw me take off all my clothes
it knew what I was doing
and it not only was aware of that
and could demonstrate that it was aware of it to me in a very beautiful way
it was also saying we can go together in the sunlight for a moment
now my sitting was I don't know half an hour 40 minutes in the sun
and the birds was only a few minutes
maybe not even a few maybe two
but we were sharing
and that sharing can't really be encompassed by language or concepts or tests or theories
it's much deeper than all of that it's much older than all of that
most of that stuff is really very very new
if we think of time in terms of the age of the world
but not just the single age of the world
the combined age of all of the beings that have ever existed here
and this is one of the problems that humans have when we think about time
our machines have deceived us
we don't understand that organisms form trans-temporal hyper structures of relational time
in which there's an exchange, a transformation, a relationship
that allows us to participate in each and be informed and transformed
by the unique symphony of temporalities in nature
and this I find endlessly fascinating and astonishing
I remember when it first occurred to me that something like this was possible
I nearly lost my mind with astonishment
because I realized that each of the cells in my body
and all of the microbial life on earth
is experiencing time at a radically different rate
perhaps one day per minute or for a cell
and in the between of them time is exploding like light from the sun
organisms make time
we can think of this mechanically but it's not very helpful
you see each of the processes in the cell has different rhythms
so even within a single cell there are organelles
if it's a eukaryote animal cell
and the organelles have their own temporalities within the cell
and so time is a many splendid thing
and it helps to transfer a couple of concepts that we neglected
to understand very deeply because we were mostly concerned with physics, not relation
from relativity
and the first of those concepts is non-simultaneity
no two observers can experience the same stimuli at the same time
in fact as each observer occupies a unique world line
it's not possible for them to experience the same thing at the same time
to do so they would have to absolutely share all world lines
which would mean they'd be the same creature
and there are some deeply fascinating repercussions of this fact
in thinking about time
I think we've been misled to think of time like a bowl
and if two things are in the bowl for a minute
well they both experience that same minute, that same duration
it's not so
in fact they each experience especially if they're organisms
but even if they're not
they each are experiencing and contributing to myriad temporalities
not merely the time inside the bowl
it's hard to find a good analogy for how astonishing this is
if we can entertain an idea about it
and particularly if we're able to have the kinds of ideas that lead us from thought
into direct experience of temporalities
when I look at the animal tracks
I wonder when they were made
it can't be very long ago
they look pretty fresh
the soil had been moist
now it's drying out
the tracks are pretty fresh
it might be a regular dog and not a coyote
some people bring dogs in here and perhaps sometimes dogs get in here on their own
so I'm not sure what made the tracks
I'm fairly sure it was a coyote
so it occurred to me after my meditation
that it might be interesting to talk about observation
to watch other beings in situations
and also
peculiarly
the senses we have and concerns we have about being observed
now this is a really deep topic
and our modern situation is extremely bizarre
because now we're being observed, catalogued, analyzed
psychographized by machines
for the purposes of institutions
not really for the purposes of people
and that's a terrifying wrongness
unless our technological cultures crash
which probably will happen
whether or not it happens immediately is another question
but unless they collapse we must expect this kind of thing
that will be going on far into the future
and we may need to learn how to change the priorities
that are involved in mechanical observation
in such a way that at least if they are not overtly healthy
they're not overtly harmful
and it's an accomplishable task
I have some models around that that I call the knowledge ant
but it's not my goal to talk about that today
I want to talk about seeing one another
and how that works and some features of observation and thought
that are unique in how our species experiences and enacts them
the bird, I do not know exactly what was going on in its mind
I suspect it has a mind
but probably not a conceptual or linguistic mind
or if it does it has a very unique version of this
but when it saw me take my clothes off to sunbathe
it thought something
it had some feeling, some urge
its own perspective
and somehow it decided
hey, that's a nice thing
let's do that together
let's have some together time in sunbathing
and it's aware that I'm observing it
and I'm aware that it's observing me
and we're both aware that we're observing each other
and that our nature and interiority is transformed by observation
it changes
it's not the same as being alone
the birds are very clear that we have a friendship
we've established trust
over time
the regularity of the safety
they can feel around relating with me
is unique
they may have other human friends
they may have other bird friends and animal friends too
plant friends and tree friends
this place they live in is like an externalized womb
and this is a very important thing to understand
because all of the living beings of Earth
are living in a shared externalized womb
and if the womb is damaged
all of them suffer from it
all of them
now nature is very complex
and organisms are profoundly opportunistic
so they can hitchhike on all kinds of things
but there are some things the complex organisms cannot survive
even if the microorganisms can find new ways
of taking advantage of changes in the environment
so while damage to the womb affects every being
because it's a shared context
a living shared context like a womb
we humans have to have special awareness of this
and we're trained to have the opposite
we're trained to offload the damage of luxury inconvenience
on all other beings
and when we're engaged in that kind of behavior
we're just harming the living beings now
we're harming the living beings in the past
by defecting from our unity and communion with them
and the unspoken agreements that living beings preserve
when they're actually intelligent
and we're harming the living beings in the future
we're harming our own children
we're harming each other
we're harming the context
now it's not possible to exist without causing harm
but there are degrees
some of which are catastrophically misguided and deadly
and our species particularly at the collective level
but often at the individual level
has made a tradition
out of being disconnected from the womb
and thinking ourselves separate and distinct
omnipotent and unavailable to harm
and this is a complex thing
because our history is very strange
rather than living where it's good for us to live
we developed technologies
and wore the skins of other beings
so we could survive where it's very cold
and we developed ways of surviving where it's very hot
and so we kind of spread everywhere
and we transform elements of the environment into objects
which means killing
and not just the elements that are transformed
but of course the waste that is produced and so on
and all of this is quite problematical
and I can lather on about it another time
that presumes there is another time
but today I want to talk a little bit about our social nature
and our psychological nature
whether or not we buy into psychology as a science
or an art or practice
we can learn astonishing things from paying attention
maybe even from outside the context of psychology
so that the insights we might discover there
can be translated into other kinds of insight
useful in the broader context of our human experience
and interiority
because we are profoundly social creatures
and again in modernity
forgive me when I generalize here
I'm aware of generalizing and it's dangerous
because we are so profoundly social
various aspects of our social needs
can be captured and counterfeited
and sold back to us in broken, unnerishing or toxic forms
and our institutions and cultures
have become very adept at this process
and in fact most of why we are being observed by machines
is because there are corporations
and companies and governments
that want to steal our attention
they want to seduce us
into joining their program
whatever that may be
which gas station do you buy gasoline at
which socks do you wear
what shoes do you like
which foods do you buy
how are they packaged
which shows do you watch
when do you watch them
the capacity for mechanical analysis
of our attentional habits
and our rhythms
and our peculiar personal interests
concerns, fears, outrages and so on
all of this can be captured in ways
that counterfeit
our true essence as humans
that counterfeit our needs
and sell us dead tokenized replicas
or dolls in a way of them
but what I'm actually concerned about today
are the processes in our minds
and these are mental habits
that once acquired become extremely compelling
much like addictions if not actually being addictions
and so we have concerns
many of us about how we are seeing
and who is seeing us
now some of us have become a bit more sophisticated here
and we may have concerns
that are slightly the polarity of that
with what kind of mind or intent
am I observing the tree
or the man or the child or the woman
or the grandmother or the dog or the cat
or the show on TV or Facebook or Instagram or whatever
because these observational behaviors
can actually catalyze
and require different kinds of minds
our observational behaviors change our rhythms
they change our priorities, our values
and in most of what we're subject to as moderns
changes are undesirable and dangerous
but in our minds
we, I think you'll all agree
we have concerns about how we are viewed
how we are seen
what others might think
what possible others might think
what's theoretical others
average people, the common people, the normal people
the ordinary people
what the authorities will think
the police, the government, the institutions
what they will make of our behavior
and whether or not they will try to punish us
or deprive us of something essential
and even when we are thinking in our minds
essentially by ourselves
these concerns can become so profound
that in our thoughts
the idea of possible others observing us
can transform so that we experience it
specific implementations or styles of it
we can come to imagine
that our worst fears are always happening
that people and corporations and institutions that observe us
are observing us with malign or judgmental or critical intention
and sometimes that's true
but our minds are so malleable, so changeable
that we can have the experience of being tortured by observation
even when none is occurring
we can have the experience of being tortured
by the possibility of judgment rendered into the fact of being judged by our imaginations
and in our minds we can't tell the difference between that
and actually judgmental or hateful or malign intentions in others
often when I'm speaking with someone I love or care for
I will hear in their speech
the sounds of the particular music
of the intrusion of an inner critic or judge
or analyst or comparator
and people will ask me questions like
is it weird that I don't feel the urge to smile when I see other people
or they'll actually just say
I must be weird because I don't participate in some behavior
that's considered by theoretical cohorts in my mind
imagined populations of normal people
I must be weird because I don't do this thing
or I must be weird because I do this thing
that confuses some people
and with our critical faculties some can quickly become all
and now we're in a trap where our awareness has been compromised
by a concern introduced by measuring
and sometimes we may have these concerns
when some aspect of our life path and experience transforms
particularly if we've been isolated
because in isolation these kinds of trouble
problems become much more common and entrenched over time
if we're not receiving positive attention from others
there's an aspect of our awareness, our social intelligences
that will go looking for reasons why
why am I not being loved
why do I always eat alone
why am I unworthy of the care and concern
that I see others apparently sharing in their life
and these questions have the propensity to form processes
and those processes become more elaborate
and dominant in our consciousness when we're isolated
or in crisis or when we're sick
or dysregulated, the harmonies of the rhythms of our bodies
and metabolisms and thoughts become dysregulated
and that's a strange word dysregulated
what I mean is the synchronizations are broken
and so the processes not only can no longer hitchhike on each other's rhythms
and activities, accomplishments
something like the opposite happens
where they begin to conflict very severely
and aspects of our mind can literally go to war
with the remnants of what might have been
a healthy, enjoyable, fulfilling way of being human
in our awareness and in our thoughts and in our concerns
and we have another problem which is that
various kinds of accounting can happen in thought
and also important kinds of similar processes can die out
and be replaced by things that are relatively toxic,
delusional, dangerous, painful and confusing
and all of us will have some experience of this
it doesn't matter who we are or when we live, where we live, who we're with
we will all have some experience of this
you know, sometimes I put some water on the stove to boil and cook some food
and then I go in the other room while the water is heating up
because it's not my intention to watch the pot until it boils
so I might do something in the other room
maybe I'll distract myself and look at Facebook or mess around on my computer
most of the time not doing anything very interesting with that astonishing piece of technology
sometimes I do
and after a while I will, usually I will smell something
I will smell the steam or I may smell something burning if I've waited too long
and then I'll realize, oh crap, that pot on the stove
I became distracted and as many of you know in old pots and steel pots and such
when water burns it's really a problem
and it's actually kind of a crazy idea that water can burn
but the pot on the stove is kind of a crazy thing
so what's happening there is a sentinel process
a process that watches over something
first I get distracted
so that process isn't getting the funding and awareness of attention that it would otherwise get
and when that happens the process may wake up a bit later
and sort of metaphorically tap me on the shoulder and say, hey, what about that pot on the stove
I give this as an example of a sentinel process
and we have many different kinds
we have opportunity sentinels
things that are on the lookout for possibilities that would be beneficial
or would perhaps allow us more time to not do anything productive
for example, when I'm walking around
I often pay fairly close attention to small features around me and on the ground
and it's not uncommon that I'll find money
or rather it's uncommon but it occurs
and so my opportunity sentinel has cashed the awareness
didn't mean the pun there
that it's possible to find very valuable things on the ground
and sometimes I find someone's wallet and the last time that happened
I was actually able to locate the person non-electronically
and return their wallet to them
even though I couldn't figure out where they lived
or if they were visiting or are they around where I find the wallet
so it was kind of a peculiar thing where first I found the wallet
it had a little money in it, I don't know, 30 bucks or something
I kept it all together in a plastic bag
and then eventually I saw a man on the street
and I said, is your name Axe and he said yes
well, I think I may have found something that belongs to you
would you mind telling me your last name
and he told me his last name and I said yes
yes, it's you, I have your wallet
wait here, I'll go get it
and I did and was able to return it to him
and he tried to give me some money out of the wallet
and I said no, no
and he said well I really appreciate it
and I said well that's a wonderful reward by itself
so there are all different kinds of opportunities
and most of them we're unaware of
in fact in the vast forest of available opportunities
us humans are mostly a bit like zombies
we pay attention only to those things that we habitually pay attention to most of the time
and thus we're often sort of sleepwalking through life
with a broken opportunity sentinel
and in many cases an extremely inflated threat sentinel
I remember meeting electronically coming into contact with a young woman
and when we first spoke
I think some people are concerned
that I might be judgmental or intimidating
because they have never met me
and their ideas about me are based on their exposure to my posts
and I can understand why someone who read my posts
might think that I was a very cunning analyst or judge
and their threat sentinel could get quite charged up
and think oh this person will judge me
and that's not an unreasonable concern
if by reasonable we mean possible
now possibility is a really strange thing
because it's not amenable to analysis
unless we can get some data points and some statistics
and transform our thought of possibility
we can begin sort of chasing that
and we can produce an analytical framework
in which probabilities can be derived
of course this is a big problem for our physics knowledge
with quantum mechanics and perhaps with string theory
I don't think we yet understand we're missing something
we're missing something really fundamental and blatant
something a child could probably see
but that would be very difficult for a sophisticated intelligence
that was normatively encultured
I hate that word normative
that was enculturated in the time that we live
with the ideas the catalog of ideas and theories and explanations
that are currently at play
in any case I remember a meeting with this young woman
and she could barely speak
it's not because she has any trouble speaking
or can't form words or thoughts
but rather each time she tried to form an utterance
a number of critical observers in her mind
intervened and could see ways to frame
what she was trying to say as something other
than what she was trying to communicate
and because she felt this pressure of her critical processes
and these are aspects of threat sentinels by the way
she could not really emit a sentence
she would start to and pause
and then there would be an angry no
or a string of the word like
like no
well if I know
like something like this
this person who I'm speaking of is somebody I love very dearly
and I don't judge her
but she helps me understand my own mind
with her struggles
and over time
she realized that not only was I not going to judge her
but that it was very easy for me to love and care for her
and learn with her
and benefit from her unique life experience
and ways of mind
and after we became comfortable together
she was able to speak much more clearly
and that was a joyful moment
and I think has continued even though
current circumstances are presenting
very serious problems
for the mental well-being
of our people
unfortunately our context
and the way it intrudes upon awareness
dominating it
subjugating it
enslaving it
this causes
aspects of our potential intelligence
to attack their own origin
much in the same way
that our species as an extended cohort
is actively obliterating
the living womb that all beings here share
so many of us
and I have my own experience of this
are trapped in a sense
with forms of behavior
cognitive behavior, emotional behavior, mental behavior
that are fundamentally toxic
and once they become well established
they will then compete to remain well established
the same way a corporation that gets funding
competes not necessarily to solve the problems
it may have been formed to solve
but instead to survive and distribute itself
as widely as possible
and grab terrain and market and so on
so there is an aspect of
the way we have minds
such that processes
that are continuously or frequently enacted
gain precedence very quickly
and they can draw more and more
of our attentional energy, our awareness energy
our consciousness energy
away from the pool that could otherwise
be differently invested
be differently enacted
be differently embodied
and all of us have some exposure to these problems
and for some of us we have little else
I know and love people whose minds
are constant battleground
of terrifying criticisms, judgments
rages, shame
histories, brokenness
and for some of these people
it's very rare for them to get even one minute
where the sentinels that have become dominant
in their mind settle down enough
for them to have something resembling awareness
or the capacity to direct their attention
according to what is good and true
and pleasing
what is healthy and beneficial
for them
and yet
even with these particular people I'm thinking of
when we are together
we both transform because the relational between of us
has opportunities that their mind on its own doesn't have
and that my mind on its own doesn't have
so in that relational between
we can choose to create a context
that nurtures and celebrates
our capacities for loving kindness
for clear undivided attention
for play, for wonder
for an amnesis, the remembering of ourselves
the remembering of our origins, natures
potentials, opportunities
and sometimes
it can take quite some time
to
usefully contend with
the processes and concerns
fears and agonies
that we are both carrying in our unique ways
somehow we have to find a way to sweep all that aside momentarily
or set it down
so that there's some energy available to us
to invest
in a way that's mutually nourishing
nurturing, healing
inspired and beautiful
but we do
even if it's a struggle
even if it takes hours
sometimes
to drill down through
the highly structured habitual layers
of
historical inaction and dominance of threat sentinels and
harm accountants and
fear
yet we do
and when we do
it's as if we've both been released from prisons
and somehow
even if I'm not as fraught
in my mind as they may be
but
when we achieve a moment of freedom together
I am profoundly
excited and happy and joyful
and it feels really worth
the effort to have slogged through
all of the kind of toxic effluent
that our isolation
can build up
and when they see that blue sky of opportunity and freedom
even if just for a moment
part of me that was caged goes free
and we enjoy that liberation together
and that seems to me to be beautiful and human
trustworthy and true
but
most of us live
the life of our minds
is imprisoned
in layers and layers of structured histories
of enacting various sentinels and
it's terribly unfortunate
that when we are children we're introduced to the idea of courtrooms
and legalisms and justice
because those things have nothing really to do with justice
those are counterfeits of justice
in almost every case
again there may be exceptions again I'm generalizing but
the courtroom idea
that if only our case could be heard
people would finally understand
why we seem different from what they expect
why we did something
that's ordinarily thought of as wrong or bad
selfish or greedy
or violent
if we could tell the whole case
then others would finally see
the suffering we've been stewing in
often for decades
sometimes for lifetimes
and there's something to that
I don't wish to dismiss it entirely
and yet it's a broken model
of justice, the whole courtroom, prison
nightmare
that has been with our people for so long
and there are good examples of other peoples who
don't play that way
and for them
justice means the return to relational harmony
not the accounting of harm
debt
and punishment as payment
for debt
for when we engage in wrongdoing
there's no escaping
the debt
even if superficially
we're not punished
or charged
and we needn't fear that
in the fullness of time
our debts are taken care of
they dissolve
in various ways and transform
but it's not my goal here to talk much about that
what I'm more concerned about
is
that our minds
imagine
I'm not using the word simulate on purpose here
our minds are imaginal societies
and so when we're taught about courtrooms
we establish courtrooms in our minds
courtroom like processes
that we use to determine
whether we've been harmed or done harm or
deserve something or don't
and so on
and this is extremely confusing and confused because
in a healthy communal village
or a small cohort
relation
and its harmonies and benefits
would naturally acquire precedence
to any kind of abstract theory
or model
and this is really the problem here
it's abstraction
and what I mean by abstraction is
departure from actual relation
with our own interiority
the relational between and the interiorities of others
other beings, other humans
so that the result
is kind of a dead model
formed not in relation
but in something
that sometimes resembles rational thought
but is rarely full bodied enough
to achieve the forms of rationality
that would truly benefit our minds
and understanding, awareness, insight and intelligence
so our minds in a way
are imaginal societies
and when isolated
there's a very strong, gravidic tendency
for our minds to collapse toward constant
observation of threat
and what are people thinking
and what would these people think
and what do those people think
and why do they think this
and they must hate me
I hate them
all kinds of crazy nonsense
get storming around in the maelstrom of
our
the remnants of what otherwise might have been meaningful
experiences of awareness and relation
learning and intelligence, wonder, play
fulfillment
one of my friends
who apparently at some point decided
that I was just a very selfish bad person
this doesn't happen very often
but it does happen occasionally
and broke off contact with me
I remember him telling me once
that when he's walking down the street
he finds it extremely troubling
and disturbing
but he can't see what's going on behind him
and many of the processes
that I've been speaking about
have this strange propensity
to look backward
to reprocess histories
in an attempt to understand
a couple of things
what went wrong
how did I get in trouble
why was I judged
why was I evicted from relationships
why am I alone
where is the family
where are the beloved others
why is it so empty in here
now of course since we imagine societies
we take our cues
for their forms, purposes and structures
from the imprintings we underwent in childhood
and throughout our lives
we take cues from
what I think is misnamed
as culture
because most of
what is pointed at by this word
is really culture at all
it's a bunch of mimetic
contagious garbage and poison
so if we bring those processes inside
and imagine
build our little inner sociums
in their image
it's quite likely that nightmares will ensue
now not all of us are as vulnerable
to this
some of us are extremely vulnerable to this
in that we are inclined
toward these vulnerabilities
and others of us become vulnerable
when conditions are
really challenging
and isolation for humans is one of the most
challenging of conditions
I imagine that vast throngs of people
have lived and died in terrible isolation
however in the modern
situation it's much weirder
and it's deeply troubling because
we can be completely surrounded
by people in the heart of a metropolis
and still have no meaningful relationships
no positive observation
of beloved others
no praise
no celebration of our being
here together
and that presents
an irresolvable conflict
to the sentinels who might otherwise
attempt to understand something useful
about why we may be isolated
or injured or sick
or impoverty
and this form of
exacerbated hyperbolic conflict
is everywhere in our common daily experience
for most of the evolution
of our people
it wasn't possible
to be in constant exposure
to people with whom
we share no common
agreements, ceremonies
values
for most of our evolution
I think we lived
in relatively small, very intimate groups
and in small intimate groups
it's still possible
to become isolated
but it's not probable
it doesn't happen very often
and when it does it's often the sign that something has gone wrong
and the origins of that problem have to be looked into together
so that it can be resolved
and this was for
tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of years
the common experience of being human is that we would do this together
when something went sideways
we would go looking for its origins
and attempt to resolve them at the origins
rather than
in the symptom
of a particular individual
so that if there was a problem
with an individual
the cohort would recognize
we've been making a mistake somewhere
otherwise this problem would not have emerged
and they would go questing
for the origin of the problem
and then there would be care
sacrifice perhaps
and celebration
unfortunately for us we live in
kind of the opposite situation where
once there's a problem
we attack the expresser of the problem
we presume it's the expresser's fault
this would be like presuming, I don't know
that
if I acquired an infection
there must be a problem with my hand
so I better punish my hand
alright
we attack the symptom
and what that does is double down
and inflate
the
the facets of its origin
that in so doing we ignore
it's a tragic situation
but it's also
it can help us to understand
how our minds
can become so warped
by our experience
that we can't form anything resembling
awareness
and it's an endless battle
of judges and critics
and analysts and accountants
and jailers and punishers
and torturers and so on
now I don't want to give the impression
that because I have some awareness of these things
that I am free of them
I'm actually just trying to understand more clearly
in the hopes that
with understanding
we can learn together
how to heal each other and also how to assemble contexts
even if they're only momentary
but they only last for a few minutes
or an hour or a day
in which we can do
the kind of inner archaeology
that can assist us
in accomplishing a changing of the guard
in our awareness so that
the sentinels are understood and respected
for their useful properties
but they don't become hyperbolic
and dominant and endlessly hungry
like some kind of a ghost or a monster
in our minds
and you know
it's not impossible to do this work alone
but it really needs a village
it needs a cohort
it's a very small cohort of two
or three
and this opportunity is always before us
anytime we can together
recall the opportunity and its value
and then travel in the general direction
we don't have to succeed all at once
we just have to make a little bit of progress
so that we can learn, ah, there's another direction
we can travel together
in our learning that can be very healing
and reassuring
nurturing
playful, joyful, humorous
healthy
we're an animal
that is profoundly hungry for meaningful roles
relationships
and
opportunities
to deepen
our mutual concern and awareness
and presence and love
it's ironic
that an animal so profoundly
in need of deep
meaningful social relation
is constantly subjected
to every other kind of nonsense
and pain
it's even more ironic
when we're in a context where we're surrounded
by others with whom we generally don't relate
to
our minds were born
in a context where we sought
the positive and reassuring
nurturing and encouraging
attentions of our parents
and this is true
whether we grew up with our actual parents
or there were other adults
who were
embodying those roles
our minds were born
from
the hope
of acquiring
the positive attention
that's
that's
the
that's the
that positive attention
is what directed
our faculties and intelligences
in the process of learning
to walk upright
or to manipulate
an object with our hand
to write, to draw, to speak
and understand language
and many of us suffered
terrible agonies as children
because instead of
the reassuring and common
presence of the positive attention
of our mother, father, grandmother, grandfather
brothers, sisters, siblings
we many of us got a lot of
critical and negative attention
and we internalized that
and this is part of how
the whole broken
of pain and judgment
and criticism and false accounting
you know, courtroom like situations
became prevalent
though even if we had
a relatively secure and
nurturing childhood
we're still going to eventually leave the nest
most of us and face the world outside
sometimes with
the support of others who love us
our actual parents or possibly
our alo parents
adults who
though they may not be
our genetic progenitors
fall in love with us
in the parental way
we take on the role of parents
as we grow
but it's very difficult
to navigate the modern world
without a social basis of support
encouragement, reassurance
positive attention
and there's no
simple answer
if we can form cohorts
together, little alo families
and such
then we have the opportunity
to give and receive
positive encouraging human attention
and that's a very healing medicine
and even if we're isolated and terrified
and broken and frightened
we still have the capacity
to redirect
the flows
because our thinking
is a bit like a behavior or a habit
and so we can slowly introduce something
new and good and nourishing
a little bit of time and practice it
and even if we're isolated
which I hope that we're not
but even when we are
we can learn
in a sense to begin to be loving parents
and siblings
and companions to ourselves
and after a lifetime of harm
in a mind that's disorganized by fear
and shame and anger
and threat
it's a very challenging thing
but it's still possible
to make a little bit of headway
to take tiny steps in this direction
and open up the compass
so that
even given
all of the challenges we might face
we can have some experience
of harmony
and self-care
and freedom from judgment and criticism
and accounting and courtroom
in our hearts and minds
as we walk through life
I myself have experienced
unimaginable isolation
things I never imagined possible
and I was lucky
for some of that time
in that
some of the really beautiful
and profound opportunities
of consciousness and creativity
and play and discovery
and learning
had been so well established
that it took a long, long time
for the isolation to wear through
those healthy membranes
but it does
it can
so I too suffer from the things I hear described
and they're very challenging
the fact that I can talk about them articulately
is helpful and useful
and in a way
you can think of this talk
not as me lecturing
about something I've mastered
but rather
as me
as an aspect of my awareness
reminding myself
of the nature of the troubles
their origins
and the directions toward opportunity
healing, growth
learning and freedom
thank you so much
for walking with me today
for your attention
for your kindness
for your humanity
and your interest in learning together
I'm deeply grateful
and I look forward
to learning again
very soon
bye bye for now
