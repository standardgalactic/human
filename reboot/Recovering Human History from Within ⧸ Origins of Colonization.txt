Hello everybody. Welcome.
I'm very grateful to all of you who pay attention to my posts.
And especially those of you who like or share them.
And particularly my patrons.
Few though they are.
You make a lot of light in my life and
help me to have the freedom to keep doing
this work. This joyful creativity.
This explorations.
So really grateful.
Particularly to my long time supporter
H. And my new supporter
C.
And you know if you have
a little something that you can spare each month.
One, two bucks. It's fine.
Whatever you've got.
That will help me keep producing this content
and keeping it real
on the internet.
Circa 2024.
So for this year is that 2024 isn't
a year. The last year we will ever have
as human beings around here for the foreseeable future
was 2023.
And this dumpster fire of insanity that we are presently
experiencing is actually not
a year at all. In fact
you know your mileage may vary.
I'm pretty sure that things aren't things anymore.
All that stuff we used to think we knew what that was or what was going on
or what would happen next or who was
who or all of that knowledge thing and knowing stuff.
That's all gone.
Mushroom cloud of over the
horizon of identity.
And in some ways that's wonderful.
Because a lot of the whatness
and the is-ness and all that
was broken. But in other ways
we don't have any kind of ship that we can ride in together
because we really never forged a we
in the first place except on very small scales.
And we didn't go around building ships either.
And you know by that I just mean
a trustworthy
vehicle
of purposeive
orientation together.
Almost all of the
potentials of our communal
relationships and behavior
has been
thoroughly
recursively recolonized
by the
thrisplike dead inside infinitely hungry
processes
that establish themselves
in the human cognisium, the network of human minds.
If we don't do
the necessary bonding
if we don't do the necessary engineering
of our relationships
with history, the sky, nature, the living places
the plants, animals and insects, the ancestors
are dreaming.
And what I will loosely refer to as the angels
the non-human intelligences
the accessible non-human
intelligences above the human cognisium.
That have been lost to us
lost to our direct contact and
experience for so long even though
most of us probably
were born with these
relationships intact and they may have stayed intact
briefly during the earliest phases of our
human incarnation, childhood, inconsistency and stuff.
But that stuff gets
well, what does it get?
It rarely survives
the processes of in-languaging and in-culturation
which
our parents and peers impose on us
believing that to be
some wonderful inheritance.
And the problem there is that
it could be.
If it were rich and veritable and ancient
and true, the processes of in-languaging
and in-culturation would not be
so violent
so
dissociative, malignly dissociative
so isolating
so terrifying, so confusing
but unfortunately
us moderns
with very few exceptions I mean the world
let's be clear about something
when I make very general statements about the humans
I'm making a bad mistake and it's one that I've pointed out many times
I am
making a mistake I would call generalizing the worst common denominator over the manifold
so the manifold is all the different living places
and humans presently alive on earth
and the generalization is that they're all
modern. Well a lot of them aren't
and each of the cohorts we might
explore or contact
or come into actual relationship with rather than just
thinking about them, right? And this is the problem with
abstract thought. We can dissociatively pretend to be in
relationships we don't have and then
from there we can evaluate the resulting abstractions
and this obliterates our intelligence, right?
It's like a snuff film of the possibilities of
actual understanding or relating with
the children, the little children are painting
and their paintings are amazing, so beautiful and colorful
and see in those little children
all of this worst common denominator stuff
is not yet established
they are still alive inside
and there are many exceptions
beautiful exceptions
to this worst common denominator
evaluative
behavior, misbehavior
that
that I'm concerned about
and we should celebrate and recognize
the exceptions, yes the bell curve
yes the averages
and yes they're devastating because
their
defection, the capacity to defect from our humanity
to colonize
and re-colonize
to devastate
to
I'm looking for a neologism here
that means to cause
to viciously impose forgetting
to amnese
to
to
it's funny
to
the terrible weapons
of colonization
and this word gets overused these days for all kinds of things
but what I'm talking about is when
the possibility of human
of coherent human relation, intelligence
conservation of ancestral
land, places, living places
intimate symbiosis
of humans with the earth
and the waters and the sky
which is rarely
approaches perfection
but in many places
actually became coherent and beautiful and was sustained over time
and colonization is sort of
I remember
a bad cartoon
maybe from the early 80s called Godzilla meets Bambi
and there's just you know you see Bambi's hanging out
and then suddenly boom there's a footprint
and then Bambi's smushed in that
in the bottom of that footprint
and that's
you know that's a cartoonish
image
Eddie
Eddie
but the forces of colonization rose
in peoples
and cohorts and societies and nations
that were self-colonizing
and this is part of the problem
that is overlooked when we
blame
history on bad people
and particularly when we
take the convenient exit door
and think oh yeah
it's patriarchy
it's those males dominating things
slapping them with their generative organ
crushing them
and while that's not untrue
the secret
origins of these problems
preserved against our discovery
when we make convenient
indictments
because if we want to understand
how it might be possible for us in our time
and our children's time to establish actually coherent
intelligent human societies worthy of survival
never mind capable of self-sustainment
but virtuously
beautiful in spirit and purpose and behavior
then we're going to need a much better
array of toys, array of perspectival toys
with which to examine what led
to the problems we face today
and you know the common
the common figurines
that we like to
excuse me that are often selected
for admonition
and indictment and
elevation in our awareness
to the status of culprits
our
monotheism
patriarchy
commerce
commodity commerce
class
hierarchical class
dichotomies
the one percent
the wealthy
the kings and queens particularly
in various phases of the development of Europe
and the Middle East
I don't know
you know personally I'm not well educated
enough historically
to understand the real birth places of
the colonizing virus
I love the cadences of German
it's wonderful to hear people enthusiastically speaking German
as they walk past me
and you know we might think oh what synchronicity
Nazism, colonization
yeah go ahead think what you like
but try to understand that what I'm saying is
not real yet
that stuff we're exchanging around
like a new kind of poison
in the atmosphere of what we have
ironically called social justice
is not the elixir
nor is it the intoxicant
we're going to have to authentically go back
not merely into the history of our
species
but very carefully into the history of our own lives
your life, my life, our childhood, the transitions
the phases of colonization
that we ourselves underwent
as little children that our parents underwent
that our grandparents underwent because
I
I would like you to
suspect with me
that not only
is the key to the cage hidden
you know the keys to the cages
not only is it hidden in our
in the arc of our developmental experience individually and collectively
uniquely keys in each one of us
have been secreted
obscured, occulted
but something even stranger
is real and accessible to us
which is that through a process
that resembles something we don't have a good word for
and I'm disinclined to forge
a convenient neologism here
because I want a really good one
I want a creative label
in the same way that
geologists look at the strata
the layers
in places where they have been laid bare to
our access on the land
the only really good example
that I have at hand easily accessible is the Grand Canyon
a place where a furrow
has been dug by a river
into the physical body of geologic time
and so the strata
are laid bare and I guess the other
more destructive and I think
way to try to get at this information
or these recordings if you will
these memories is with core samples
carefully
drill a tube
you extract tubes of earth and stone and ice and stuff
in a sequence
and then you lay them out in a linear fashion
and examine the record but what I'm trying to say
what I'm implying here is that
and similarly
with the origin of life
branch of sciences and paleontology
where we look in the various strata for
evidence
I'd love to know the etymology of this word right now
we look for evidence of the previously existing
phases of life and development
that we imagine took place linearly
because we are
addicted to
one thing mind we are addicted to linear perspectives
we don't have to be we can break out of that
we need the experience of being liberated from
so there are these strata
in the stone in the earth
that are like memorial
dreaming traces in a way
and what I'm suggesting is that in each one of us
and in our cohorts, in our cultures, in our
ethnicities, in our ancestors, in our progeny
there are layered
richness of interiority that actually contains
the entire history of our species
there's a way of doing
a kind of archaeology
that isn't merely objective
isn't merely empirical
that is partly magical
or partly transcendental
and when you hear stories, for example
of
either accidental enlightenment
where you have some young child who at six just starts
sitting still and won't move and has to be fed
and some go-to comes and says, oh this one
has gone beyond and when you hear stories of intentional enlightenment
where
someone very committed to the meditation path
mostly you will hear similar stories
where in fact what I'm speaking about
surfaces in consciousness
thus we hear the Buddha saying
something, I don't know what the Buddha actually said
but we hear stories that the Buddha said
I have been billions of lives
I have been all of the beings in a way
this might be translated as
past lives
but I strongly suspect that the actual situation
is much weirder than past lives
and is not
linear in the ways we would imagine
so that for example
imagine
just as an example that you are
live locally to your consciousness right now
but
like a constellation
in the sky
imagine for example the big dipper as seen from Earth
those stars
the shape of the big dipper
is seen
from a point in space
now I would like to know
the names of those stars
and how distant in space time they are from each other
because let's be clear if you saw it from another angle outside of it
it would not form a dipper
some of the stars might be invisible
or there might be other stars that were visible
in the arrangement
the illusion
it's not actually an illusion is it
the figuration
of the big dipper
is we experience it because of where we are looking from
in time space and so to us
there is a dot to dot drawing
there
which over time has undergone semantic degradation
so that we think of it as a ladle cup
because I promise you
long ago they were not thinking that's a ladle cup
they probably didn't think
what was seen in the sky
resembled objects
appliances or tools
that would be a very unlikely
derivation I think
so we should take that seriously the unlikeliness of such a derivation
I mean hilariously a couple nights ago I woke up from dreaming
just to give you a sort of related example
and I don't really know what was going on
and it was sort of hilarious
but not merely funny
I got the impression
of my refrigerator
I hopefully I'll come back to this later because I want to stay on point here but
the impression of my refrigerator it's a white refrigerator
vinyl surfaced
many refrigerators and it was
deified it was like this
angelic choirs and rays of divine light
coming off the refrigerator
which is a very ridiculous seeming to my rational mind
completely ridiculous
the Luddite in me that abhors machines
it doesn't merely abhore machines
I don't merely abhore them
I recognize that coupled with the
insensate dissociate war and
prison-eering monsters
are recolonizing our existing societies
and nations and populations and so forth
those things are death sign
those are the flags of a coming apocalypse
an ever coming apocalypse right an apocalypse is happening now
has been happening for a good depending on how you want to count it
thousand years but much more so in the past
one and so forth
a sort of tidal a tide a heartbeat of doom
where the humans just are ripping the foundations
of their own minds to shreds in terms of
the origins of the possibility of intelligence and
consciousness in the anciently conserved ecologies of the
planet which are the most precious thing around here
not us our origins the womb
this planetary womb that ever renews itself
and hopefully doesn't really need to be
penetrated in order to be fertilized right light
the divine virginal penetration
of light sunlight and time spaces
the water of time space penetrated by sunlight
filled with the physical hypostases of these
primordial more than merely beings
generates life here
and it is truly holy but as I was saying those stars in the sky
they are not
coherently related to one another
except by the angle of our perspective
they belong to some family
of local anatomy
local stellar anatomy I don't think
I suspect they're wildly distant from each other
and would be seen completely differently from another distant angle
say if we drew a circle around them
if we circled actually if we made a sphere
around the big dipper at the same distance
from which our perspective arises
we made a sphere then we just traveled to different perspectives on that sphere
very different things would emerge to our perspective and what I'm trying to say
is that imagine that although your sort of spirit
or soul however you want to think about it
and there's much better ways to think about it than a spirit or a soul
your
your the localization that you think of as yourself
is probably similar to that big dipper
imagine that there are many many
beings we could start with a small number to make it easy
let's say there's 12 just for kicks
and a couple of those beings are living in the Pleistocene
the earliest time of the humans
and not all those beings are human but we're going to pretend they are for a minute
and they're living in all different times
and places of the earth
we're going to keep them on earth for the moment though that's not actually necessary either
so there's beings all throughout
the historical phases of the humans and let's say
half of them are before you and half of them are after you so six
before you and then you in the middle that you're the 13th one so to speak
and then there's six after you in the future
and those beings are all simultaneously existing
but you the you-ness the me the meanness Darren
hopefully not the meanness
but the me-ness
believe yourself as localized in this
temporal spatial manifold of relationships
when actually you're a constellation of beings
with a nucleus much like
what we think of as the solar system
and sometimes you're the sun
in that family
sometimes you're
it's funny we have the system where we
establish your relationship between each of the planets and everyone thinks
oh that's a bunch of hokey well those people who think that are very confused
but also the people who
reify the system of astrology are just as confused
because it's neither false nor fact
both of those extremes
lose the fragrance of insight
that is accessible to us as human beings
once things become explicit and we start trying to say what is a fact
and unless we're in a very limited
sort of cone of purposive orientation
and behavior there are
applicable there's an applicable scope
to what we think of as empiricism but let's be really clear
what the moderns mostly do with empiricism is kill
I use that to kill stuff now remember my friend
Phi Fernanda
from Brazil she wanted to become a marine biologist
until she discovered that what that meant was collecting living
creatures from the sea and killing them taking them apart
studying the bits of course there are other ways to do it
but the classes that she was taking
she was magically in love with the sea creatures just as I
am
until she discovered what empiricism is
about and what we do with it which is really the wrong thing
to see again here the terrifying
jagged pointy fingerprint of colonization
this is what I mean by colonization I don't mean
necessarily bad people mostly men
and yes men are the execution body of colonization
because historically primarily at least in the large
cohorts men were the
disposable soldier class
and there's so much
to look at
so yeah men were the inaction body
and sometimes
men often perhaps men were the
what
the infected dissociated
orienteering
measureers rulers
measures of value
measures of history
and futurity what does history mean
and what will we make
of this potential of our lives and moment
of our cooperative potential
one of my new friends
Roger T. who I'm not sure how to pronounce his last name
is why I'm not doing it
who has this brilliant
sort of matrilineally communicated
from his wife method of alignment
producing alignment in human cohorts particularly in business but not
not necessarily merely in business
call this apex cooperators
it's a brilliant phrase I'm not sure if he coined that phrase
or who coined it
but yeah it looks like it was men and I'm not denying that there's a problem
with
I'm going to make a joke here
with having the external three part flower downstairs
historically
but this measuring and what the problem
is that the males who perpetrated
iterations
of recursive colonization
were first themselves colonized
this is the actual this is the thing we need to see
and we know we have some
we I don't even know who I mean by we let's just say that
culturally and sociologically we are we have become aware
that
many of the people
who perpetrate violence
and subjugation
and murder
and rape and violation
were themselves subjected
to these
deprivations and impoverishments and terrors
in their developmental
arcs
and it's not clear to me anyway
that in a coherent
or small scale
coherent human family
tribe, culture
it's probably extremely uncommon
that these behaviors emerge
and some will say things like well we've seen behavior like this in primates
okay
we see primates before humans invaded the jungle
and before
what is the human effect on the context
in which the primates are developing
what is the effect of the human
behavior in the world on the primate population
these features of that which exists are connected
they're not merely
we would ordinarily think rationally
that if the monkeys are in the jungle in Africa
where there are no humans presuming there was such a jungle
and humans are somewhere else doing things like making war and going insane together
killing up everything that moves and most of what doesn't it wouldn't affect
the primates until and unless
the humans showed up in the jungle
because we presume that there's no way to communicate
the malignancy
from the humans to the primates unless they're proximal
this is not true because there's always
a dimension of the context where everything's proximal
the planet is a unified
manifold of historical relational
futorial
what
transmissions communication
so whenever I hear people
saying oh it's just natural for humans to be I don't believe it
I don't believe that at all
it's conceivable but what it looks more like to me
is an infection most of the time
and maybe I prefer to see it this way maybe I'm biased
Graeber and his writing companion in the dawn of everything
push back against the idea that humans
have been
catastrophically misbehaving toward
mother and life in general for thousands of years and it's the law
of the land and so forth that myth needs to come down
I just don't trust it at all
but what I'm trying to get at is that the origins of the problems we face
are not in the men it's not merely patriarchy
and what has happened that's terrifying is that
the features
of our humanity
that are vulnerable to colonization
have been being colonized by something
and we can think of this something in a variety of different ways
for eons
and these colonizing
contagions
these colonizing pathological processes
oh wow here's the dog man with
so many dogs and yet he can keep them
all coherent
hmm
hmm
hmm
I need to have a chat with him at some point
because he's really
profoundly skillful at managing
a large group of unrelated dogs
nearly certain those dogs don't come from one
family one household
so we have to look carefully into the
history of histories and not just the written histories
the histories that are submerged within
us
the direct experience that not just the history
of life on earth and not just the history of the humans
but the history of what we think of as the universe
and the history of its origins the origin places and the origin beings
is encoded
in the strata of our being
and this is recoverable to us when so ever
whatever degree we may agree
to recover it to seek it to quest for it
to inquire as almond hillman
the half mad prophet
tells us he
in his linguistic
neuromorphosis tells
us that the ancient languages are actually
doorways into
other lost potentials
of our humanity
and for the moment at least
I'm not a big fan what does that even mean
I have a large fan in my hand and I keep waiting it
but I find his
playful and hilarious
and terrifying
manic
prophetic genius
inspiring and nourishing and propelling
but one of the things he says is that
he says this wrong but he's saying something like
the originary idea
that becomes in our time the word history
actually comes from
bringing a question to the
probably adolescent symbols
in the ancient world and he's talking specifically about
places in Europe
and what we think of now maybe as the Middle East
and Greece and so forth
Greece primarily
but also it's surrounding like the empire I guess
I don't know where all the symbols were
I don't know where we have records of them being but what he was saying
is that this idea of history it's not stories about
what happened it's to
become pregnant with the
urgency of a question
and pursue that question beyond
our common
inclinations to answer it
to declare some oh here's what happened
it's to become the re-happening
the living an amnesis of the question
and this is the kind of potential we are born to experience
the exultation of
and there's nearly no one
other biblical scholars or
classicists may criticize him and say things like
he's taking a specific sense of a specific word
and he's promoting it to the primordial sense overall
instances of this word in such a way as to twist
the perspective to produce
the truly bizarre narrative
that he wants us to swallow
about ancient Greece, the origins of Christianity
Christos, the Medusae
Medea, medicine
all these things
and hilariously
some of those critics, Dan McClellan among them
might be
technically, linguistically
and perhaps even
cognitively quote unquote correct
they're missing the point
Amans unique
and you know
intoxicated
the elixir that Amen is making
is sygenic
generative of mind states otherwise inaccessible
and they're looking at something it's just like people who've only seen
airplanes or jet aircraft which are made for war
or passenger or cargo
they're looking at
basically they're looking at a UFO, they're looking at something from outside
it wasn't even made by humans and it doesn't do the things that the human made
aircraft do at all, it has no concern about these things
it's concerned with transporting us to insight
and re-establishing anciently lost relationships
and correcting nonsensical histories
that for us have become prisons
of ignorance
and blindness
a time will tell
whether the elixir
of Amans performative and I don't mean that in the
interrogatory modern critical sense at all
the elixirs of Amans performances
are truly generative
of an amnesis and
remembering
however
personally I find them
profound and brilliant
in an admittedly iconoclastic and provocative way
so let's see if I can recover my threads
here
the colonized
colonizers
the re-colonization, so now what's going on in modernity
we have the rise of the internet
which starts out looking pretty virtuous
it resembles in potential
the Agora of ancient Greece where
Socrates and other philosophers
perhaps gathered the common people
day to day to pursue wisdom and insight
but also to pursue
convincing
condemnation, indictment, judgment, opinionaring
and the internet began this way
but it was colonized and it colonized us
and what was it colonized by
it was colonized by forces that advertise themselves
as protectors, the NSA
the national security administration
the ridiculous enforcement arms
of the government that rose in the wake of 9-11
as if 9-11 were produced specifically
to generate those
recursively colonizing
lethal organizations
and to create a future
of panopticon like surveillance
that would collapse not
the possibility of a free society
whatever that might mean, whatever it's possible for that to mean
but it would turn our own homes and relationships
into prisons, weapons that we could be threatened with
and
then with the rise of social media which again
in the beginning was a way to bring people together
and to celebrate our
potentials for intelligence and creativity and insight and play
quickly again became colonized by corporate
agendas driven primarily by two forces
advertising
the absolute, one of the most
malignant demons of our modern world
and governmental
surveillance of citizens
these twin
cyclopean, I mean that's probably insulting the cyclops
but yeah, these monsters
straight up monsters that will eat
our lives, minds and children
sell the bones to the highest bidder
so you can see this recursive
iterative recolonization
of our relationships, our interiority
our thought, our dreaming
our bodies, our metabolism
and it's as if it's a layered
it's a layered antithesis to an amnesis
it's a layered
like an acid that just eats the foundations of memory
and produces structured skeletal
remains that are commoditized
and turned into the fuel
for future iterations
and new forms of recolonization
you know it's easy to distract us
with indictments
that make little sense
if we're actually concerned about
the injustice of the histories
of colonization, slavery, misogyny
misanthropy
misbiorelation
abiotic, omniside
then we need not so much to indict and prosecute the histories
we need to understand the origins and we must establish
coherent vessels
for our communal
development, education, an amnesis
healing
enrichment
and something
what does decolonization mean
we can imagine it means something like
when the children have lice you put medicine in their hair
we need to do the opposite of
both things maybe
we need a very enlightened idea and direction
for any such project and it must be self
decolonized itself
that was really beautiful
he was saying this guy is really interesting
he's clearly a not ordinarily minded person
he's a enthusiasm that's far beyond what ordinary people would usually have
and he was saying the last few times
I told myself as I was out on my walk I'm going to pick up
five pieces of litter
each time I found a pair of expensive ray bands
I found a hundred dollars
every time I found something valuable
it was the word of synchronicity
if our orientation
is indictment and prosecution
the path is too expensive
and will continue to colonize itself
and one of the ways it will do this is with nomenclature
every time you look there's more ways
with nomenclature in other words jargon
and it's with ideology
ideological fanaticism
so we have to be aware
of those
we have to be aware of the way
a purpose of orientation that starts out
virtuous and altruistic in a trustworthy sense
is easily captured
even by its own
by the threads of its own origins
and so we have to find a way to preserve
the possibilities of virtue, insight
learning, healing, growth, so forth
there's the terrifying
machine signal
and then the horrible noise of death
every animal that ever heard that was soon to die
our cells know this is the bell
of doom when you hear the engines
almost I mean there are a few exceptions
I guess the engines of the ships
of the sea shepherd conservation society for example
are an unusual inversion of that
paradigm so what I'm trying to get us to
remember here is that
all of the executors
of colonization
were almost certainly victims of colonization first
they were infected
with the thrisp-like structure of processes
that would convert them, their lives, their children, their ancestors
the meaning of their origins
and the shape of their future to omniside
dead terrain, the production of commodities
and the coffers of the powerful and the wealthy
who are themselves sort of the seed bed
the dead inside seed bed
of the pathologies
that become
the inaction body
of the colonizing forces
that we must discover and I think I have some keys to this
which I have spoken of in the past
but we must discover and recover the origins of the problem
and clearly
...
...
...
...
...
okay I think we just got a clue here
so these geese are flipping out and the males are getting
all spun up and they're getting spun up
because a human gave a couple of them some crackers
...
it would be hilarious to discover that one of the origins
of the problem of colonization
and I think there's probably a lot of evidence
is simply the introduction of carbohydrates
once you can store up huge amounts of carbohydrates
it's sort of like what happens when you put a nectar bottle
a bottle of dyed sugar water
in a population of hummingbirds
they might have been a little bit provocative before
but once you put all those commodities in one place now you've got two problems
you've got to protect them from people who might want to take them
and it's a really attractive prize because it represents what
convenience
okay so we're going to see two things here fuel
and convenience
and there's a third thing
which is essentially
metals
particularly what we think of as precious metals
and jewels
crystals, diamonds
gold, silver, platinum, copper, bronze
iron
diamonds, emeralds, rubies, sapphires
so and I'm not even
getting close to what is actually going on
these are the later stage
catalysts of devastation
what did they really want when they sent ships to the new world
quote unquote, well they wanted gold
what were they after, gold
they might have been thinking land, but mostly they were thinking gold
did those savages have gold stored up somewhere? let's get that gold
or at least this is the story we tell and that story is probably
three quarters wrong
and maybe resembles our own projections
and projection is a large part of the problem because
if you think
your opponent is up to something
various then you have to get there first this is the race to the bottom
the perverse incentivization

and others of the
game B or new civilization
project
what has to happen obviously is that we have to establish some options
that are so much more compelling than the
zero sum competitive
pathologies we're currently enacting and
being conscripted to and punished by
and devastated for
we aren't the people of the lie
we are the generation of lying, it's different
the context is so
catastrophically multi-layeredly
toxic counterfeit
projective
everywhere we see presentations
that advertise virtue and underneath are
essentially self-purifying disease
vectors and this is
the concept that I use
my quest to understand this resulted
in a series of visions one of which introduced the concepts
of the Cognition which is the network of human minds the Mimula
which is all the features of connection in that network and Thryps
which compete for dominance of that network under conditions
in which
the organic and natural
orienting principles
that would guide and nourish and protect our collective
insight, memory,
intelligence, altruism, virtue
when those breakdown boom, Thryps everywhere
it's uh
it's similar to certain biological processes
like
those that burn down our neural networks with
prion proteins for example, one of the things
Critzfeld Jacobs disease or
otherwise known as mad cow disease
and similar prion protein
disorders
and the prions
are essential to
the differentiation of our nervous
systems and neural networks in the brain in early
development. Similarly to how
something kills off the flesh between our fingers so that you get
these differentiated very useful
articulate appendages
something resembling that happens in the brain
in our early developmental arcs
with neurons. A lot of them have to be burned off
and what that means is that's a
that's one of the things that makes us each unique because we all
undergo this kind of interior extinction event
and usually we think oh extinction is bad and it certainly is if we're
burning down anciently conserved ecologies to make more machines and stuff
that's insane, that's not
coherent or biorelationally integral about that
that's just madness
and wrongness and yeah you can take
the bigger picture, sure
oh life is resilient, earth is resilient
I'd love to see where
that perspective is arising from because if it's arising from some kind
of empirical or materialistic perspective
based on what you think is the historical data and so forth
that's dissociative, that's dissociative, you're not connecting with nature at all
you're just being
a disembodied grasping rationalist
so you're almost certainly going to be wrong about nearly
everything having to do with organisms
if that's your anchor
in consciousness and concern
a mother's concerns
much more trustworthy
she has to fund them
she has to build their bodies from her own
biology, the calcium of her bones
the metabolic products of her body
her heartbeat becomes the context
in which life emerges and while
our planet is only metaphorically
feminine in this sense, that metaphor goes very
deep and is very powerful, it's not merely
a figure of speech
so we must recover
the origins of the problem that led to
our defection
from memory, humanity, insight
virtue, mutual intelligence, mutual concern, awareness
our real cooperative abilities
and we must find ways
to establish
vehicles to conserve
develop
enact
and transmit
communicate
these potentials into the existing bodies of
anti-culture that largely own our species at this time
our children
and perhaps we may be so lucky
as to stumble into ways of being human
our ancestors by fulfilling their dreams
and what they hoped for and worked for
in the deepest recesses of their hearts, minds and spirits
all of us moderns
millions of lifetimes
we have been slaves to things that don't even exist
we have been slaves to ghosts and shadows
in the human cognisium
presenting as virtues or progress
and delivering omniside, amnesia
torture, despair
devastation of our spirit
our communality, the replacement of that
with prisonering panopticon like surveillance
systems that aren't killing us off
directly at the moment
and this is
actually part of the problem with the weird
results of technology
there are fates worse than death
and some of them involve the
slow erosion
of our interior assets and potentials
and if you can get at the thing with which we tell the difference
the thing with which we would otherwise notice what is
happening then anything that gets at that
anything that gets at the
fundamental basis of our capacity to discern change
if you can co-opt that
then the entire
bank of the history and future of life on earth
of human beings of our interiority is now open for
rape and you can get away with anything you can imagine
you just have to go slowly enough
you just have to turn the heat up in the water slowly enough that it doesn't
become the
disabled senses
we must oppose this
that would organize and galvanize us
into communal
into heroic communal
organization, intelligence
resilience and activity
so these are a few of the things
that are in my awareness today or have risen in my awareness
while I muse
with you, my listeners
in the hope of better ways of seeing
in the hope of an amnesis
pleasing the ancestors and the muses
and perhaps the angels
I'm so grateful to have this time together
and for your kind attention, your enthusiasm
your wonder, your curiosity
the spirit within you of heroic
questing recovery and rescue
and great to our human nature
may your ways and minds and dreams be beautiful and healing and profound
and may you find
joyful relation
with all the aspects of yourself, your histories, your futures
your ancestors, your progeny and all of the beings
who are in fact a single family
thank you for joining me
I look forward to learning together again
very soon, bye bye for now
