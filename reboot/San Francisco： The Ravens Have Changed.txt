The birds are aware that the humans are not as dominant in the environment as they were
just a little while ago. And so they are much more courageous than usual.
And they're not really concerned about the proximity of humans as you can see by what just happened.
The humans just ran right by the raven and they didn't care at all.
And the other raven has opened up a little packet of something red and he's chewing on it.
And I've seen this behavior all over the city today.
The crows and the ravens, they're much, much bolder than they usually are.
They are definitely aware that something has changed with humans and they're a lot less concerned about human proximity than they would ordinarily be.
Fascinating transformation happens so quickly.
They are aware that the world is changing.
These birds, when I came here, they were inside the garbage can, which is a behavior you would never see from them at this time of day.
It's quite astonishing. And in a way, it's kind of hopeful.
They're actually physically removing objects from the trash. Check them out in a broad daylight where the human is standing right next to them.
They would never ordinarily do this. Very cool.
I've also heard songs from other birds that I'm not used to hearing in the daytime or at this time of year.
Fascinating.
