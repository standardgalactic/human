Everybody knows that there's a lot of trouble and confusion and danger in our
cultures and on top of that technology is not resolving those dangers it's
exacerbating them and there are a bunch of fictional
momentums that get populated with believers and compete and it doesn't
really look anything like culture or problem-solving it looks like a kind of
a clusterfrak. I think about these matters a lot because everyone wants to
know like what well what could we do what is there anything we can do are we
helpless how can we solve millions of problems and the problems that trying to
solve them produce and the thing is we can't so that's a big distraction. What
happens is we invest all of our relational and cognitive and potential
momentum in things like worry and reactivity and complaint objection
protest and you know or or on the more radical end on violent action and trying
to interrupt the process with war like like elements whether those are a sort
of fake kind that the nations and collectives do or the revolutionary kind
that small tightly knit often rather psychotic groups do and there's an
interesting thing going on here that relates to our myths and stories about
superheroes which we all love and there's some really interesting things that we
don't notice about these myths they're about us they're actually about how we
are inside and how to organize effective mutual insight in other words the
ability to see first and then also in effective mutuality and intelligence so
here's the really interesting thing in our myths there's a crisis and the
crisis calls often from rest or distraction a number of peculiar people
each of which have conflicts but each of which have amazing special expertise
and under the ages of the need this small group forgets about everything else
which means they recover all degrees of liberty and freedom and potential from
thought worry false commitment lies fictions and they focus together on a
specific urgent problem but they all have a necessary interest in both
understanding and resolving so they make a purpose of envelope and then they get
inside together that envelope returns all degrees of freedom to them they can
now invest their attention intelligence potential in entirely unique ways that
contradict the culture tradition ideas everything and they will have to because
they've got a problem that they can't solve by putting out the little fires of
the edges they've got a problem that they have to get at the root of and change
the root situation now this is a model of our fake collectives they all do this
in a phony way for fake purposes but in small tightly knit groups we can do this
together and every time we see it being done we get very excited but for some
reason probably because we're incredibly invested in fictions and we don't we
weren't trained to do this we don't do a simple thing we don't assemble a small
group of experts each of whose skills complements the others we don't then
resolve the conflicts that might be within that group for the sake of the
mutual purpose and the potentials of resolving it and in general we just make
movies and continue to be the passive recipients and the active participants in
schemes and ideas and fictions that rob us of all of our degrees of liberty so
that we cannot even discover what we are or could be never mind solve the
problems that the failure to do that is actually the root of in every case the
failure to assemble small tightly knit intelligent groups with authentic
purposes for each other in the world and our development is in fact the root of
all the problems that have stolen the degrees of freedom we might otherwise
enjoy explore and develop together we must resolve that it will never be
delivered to us we will either learn this and become the solution or we will
remain members of all of the processes that we don't understand don't agree
with and are wiping out our intelligence health and world
