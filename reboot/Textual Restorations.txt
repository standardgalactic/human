Alan and I used to do this thing where we'd take a popular piece of music or like anything
writing and we'd just re-translate it and gargle it into nonsense, complete nonsense
and then we'd post it or we'd like, we made videos with like robots reading it, we'd Google
like auto-read it and then the idea was that every piece of media that's ever been created
has been being beamed to humans from space but then the humans mistranslated it when
they created it.
So our company existed, Textual Restorations, in order to go through and re-translate all
of the texts that humans had ever created into what it was originally supposed to be
and then we'd just like, we'd just take like a Beatles song and be like, you know, like
Eleanor Rigsby, right, we did Eleanor Rigsby and be like, father, you know, father by Tuesday
do you think you'll have those socks, right, it was like the way that we would change that
line and we'd just change it into all like nonsense but the like, dripping with like
possible meaning, right, so people would read it and they'd be like, wow, like, thinking
it's like some really avant-garde, like weird shit and we'd be like, nah, it's just, no.
