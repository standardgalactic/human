Hello everybody. Welcome.
Those of you who are familiar with my work
know that I'm not really busy or interested
in blowing my own horn and etc.
But what I hope that you'll find here on my channel
are some living mirrors, some doorways
to the origins of our nature, intelligence and potential
that will unlock some cages
that we've all been stuck in
that our ancestors were trapped in
that every human being that ever drew breath
hoped to find a key to
a vector that would jailbreak the bullshit systems
that are eating our planet history and future.
And if that's part of your interest,
well, strap in because we're going to go to the sky
together right now.
Yeah, guys got it right.
We are trained to make a variety of fundamental mistakes
and from childhood onward, by our parents and peers,
by the people who are supposed to be educating us,
by the people who are wearing the costumes
of our liberators, of messiahs,
of noble warriors, of extreme altruists.
They are chaining our feet to the floor.
They are cutting off our wings and stapling them
to the fucking chalkboards in the one place
that we are supposed to be able to acquire the keys
or schools or universities.
What the hell is meant by university?
It literally is supposed to be the city of the universe, right?
The place where all of the intelligences in time space
come together to sing and speak and show and remind us
to resurrect our divine memories
of our origins, natures and potentials
and what do we get instead, prison bars?
We are trained to reiterate
in thought, expectation, speculation and evaluation
a variety of catastrophic errors
that if you make any one of them,
you'll build bars every time you make a move
and if you make three, you will be a slave.
So I want to talk about some of these errors.
It's a little windy here today.
I've got my mic buffer on.
We should be in good shape.
I guess we'll find out on the far side of this arc.
One of the most profound of these errors
is that you're merely human.
Don't expect too much of me.
I'm only human after all.
Well, maybe really clear about what being human
actually looks like.
If you took the magical, supernormal powers
of every physicalized intelligence on Earth,
the octopus, the whale, the dolphin, the bat,
the praying mantis, the crane, the rattlesnake,
the electric eel, the turtle, the crocodile,
the mouse, the mole, the eagle, the hawk, the kestrel,
if you unified all those beings,
all of the beings, the forests, the coral reefs,
the nudibranchs, the plankton,
if you unified all the intelligences and forms
and abilities of those beings,
and then you mated that with the angels,
the devas, the jinn, the daimons, the gods.
That's what you were born as.
There's nothing mere about your humanity.
There never was, there never will be,
except that you are convinced
of your fundamental impoverishment
according to principles that have nothing to do with who
and what and how you came to be incarnate here on Earth.
So one of the first mistakes is that you're only human,
and if you don't believe me,
watch the hundreds of thousands, the millions of people
who escape that bond and directly show you the impossible.
The five-year-old 280 note per minute
shredding guitar player from Korea.
The ballerinas, the runners, swimmers, the athletes,
the dancers, the singers,
the occasional scientists, the mathematicians,
the seers, the healers, the real ones,
not the mimics.
Watch the dogs and the cats.
The dragon flies
because they'll give you hints
at the vast terrain of the more than merely human
you came here to be and become.
That little seemingly weak,
seemingly delicate body you have
is capable of things as yet unimagined by human beings,
let alone achieved.
And that will always be the case
because the actual scope of our potential nature, origin,
and the urgent imperatives we bring to human birth
is infinite, is a layered array of infinities.
And when you see someone doing something
that appears superhuman,
what you're seeing is merely a hint at that depth,
a hint to imagine what an actual statement
would look like is nearly impossible for us.
An actual expression of that infinite potential
could move the planet in a moment,
could move human history in an instant.
That's your potential.
However divorced we may feel
or think ourselves to be from it.
So the first common thing we're taught
is a series of limitations
that are cognitive, intellectual,
spiritual, physical, ideological, and relational
that have nothing to do with our nature.
They have to do with an agenda, a program, a process,
an array of protocols that have long dominated
human culture and experience
and particularly human collectivity.
These protocols render us into helpless slaves,
eager for any distraction from the agonies we feel
at the impoverishments we cannot understand
the origins or the opposites of
and those opposites are our birthrights.
They are not our birthrights
in the sense that you're someone
supposed to defend you having them,
although that would be fabulous.
There's something very different.
They are the innate necessities
of our human nature
and our more-than-human nature,
potential, urgency, ache, desire.
And we get sold counterfeits,
sex, drugs, rock and roll,
violence, commerce, commodification,
objectification, representations, video games.
We get sold video games
and you don't need computers to run these.
They were running them on humans
back when the conquistadors
ripped and shredded the American continent,
the South American continent,
and later the colonizing forces of Europe
landed here and obliterated wholesale
the native indigenous populations here.
Those conquistadors were infected
with the disease before they brought it here
and reinstanced it, and we are subject
to those same fucking deletions
and impoverishments here today.
We are a self-colonizing nightmare
of new ways to colonize the population per second
and to stack up representations of value
in banks, representations of power
in corporations and governments
in the military-industrial complex.
We frack the souls of our children
to build monuments to despair.
These we worship.
I don't know who we is.
Perhaps the we I mean here
is the absentee we
of our possible intentional collectivity.
The absence that appears as a presence,
which is one of the most devastating ploys,
and one of the most terrifying features
of our human experience and lives.
It's literally what we see in the horror films.
We see absences appearing as presences.
This is what drives our cultures.
We could call them that and we shouldn't.
We should just call them diseases.
The military-industrial complex are political systems,
our legal systems, and our corporations.
So this is one of the first lies that you are merely human.
The second lie that you're taught
is a lie of transference.
And let me frame this lethal fiction
so that you can recognize it in your own consciousness.
The behavior and the ideation
and desperation of your fellow humans all around you.
There's a comforting continuity
to what we call physical reality,
which I'm going to suppose is about 1%
of what's actually going on.
And it's the fact that your shoes
probably be where you left them last night.
The silverware doesn't rearrange itself in the drawer.
The ice cubes are still frozen
when you take them out of the refrigerator.
The money in the bank mostly stays there unless stolen.
That tree you saw on your walking route yesterday
is there again today
unless some idiotic arborist
in a desperate effort to justify their pay
ripped it from the earth
and chopped it up into, well, you know, sawdust or something similar,
which happens a lot here where I walk in the park.
That continuity, that reliable unchanging,
because of how we are in time, it's unchanging, right?
The stone is still the stone tomorrow.
The tree is still there.
We believe we feel most of our lives that we are immortal
even though we are aware of the possibility of death
and we may have encounters with death.
It's our relationship to temporality
that convinces us
that the compelling continuity of physical objects in space
and their organizations
is the most trustworthy fact,
absolutely reliable,
not ambiguous.
We don't have to watch over the little stone,
you know, the boulder, the mountain.
They will be there every day.
And that brings us to kind of comfort
because humans have these drivers.
We can be understood to have these drivers
orienting our awareness and concern.
Three of them.
Ambiguity, vigilance, prediction.
Increases in ambiguity, spin up our vigilance.
We're constantly concerned about prediction.
This is why we live in dead boxes
because any reduction in ambiguity
releases us from vigilance
and thus we turn from prediction to opportunism,
which we certainly prefer to the burdens
that prediction places on us,
particularly predictions about negative future events.
Events that are undesirable, painful, impoverishing,
injuring, isolating, so forth.
So these three drivers
underlie human concern and awareness,
how we forge our awareness,
what we forge it for,
how we direct it in consciousness.
And the fiction here
is that the staggering predictability
of physical reality, objects in space,
should be transferred onto the rest of existence
so that we presume
that the structured continuity of physical space
is the prototype of everything else.
Everything else is just like that structured continuity
and should be understood that way.
This is what leads to materialistic models in science.
It's what leads to physicalist reductionism
in philosophic thought.
The transfer of the expectation of structured continuity
from physical reality to all other aspects of existence.
Now think carefully about this error
because it's very subtle and largely invisible to us
unless we concern ourselves with it,
unless we float it on the waters of thought,
it will remain invisible
and we will just make the presumptions
that, for example, my friend Joe is always my friend Joe,
that I know Joe, that I know who Joe is.
And you can see what's going on here, right?
Because if I claim to know who my friend Joe is,
part of the claim I'm making
is that I'm not subject to ambiguity as regards Joe.
I know who Joe is.
I can predict how Joe will likely respond to a question or situation.
I have properly evaluated Joe due to our long association.
Joe is a stable, continuous structure in existence.
Nothing like this is or was ever or could be true.
Ancient peoples were aware of this problem.
They had discovered that the capacity for descriptive
or denotative language was fraught with prison-earing perils
that would obliterate our relationships and humanity,
turn us into slaves and prisoners
if we simply obeyed their structure.
So they learned to not do that.
They learned to preserve awareness,
potential opportunity, creativity, play,
transformation, wonder, integrity, honor, respect, awe.
They preserved these above all the structured comforts
of representational cognition and labeling language.
They knew their lives and cultures depended on it.
And when they met the colonizers, they thought,
they expected, they predicted
that these highly intelligent, apparently technologically advanced humans
would necessarily understand and enact the same principles
that trusted them.
How tragic.
None of us would think that our, you know,
presuming that our parents loved us and were loving and kind,
that our parents had agendas that would destroy us,
ruin our spirits, wreck the many forms of flight we are capable of,
flight into the outer space of ordinary humanity.
That's very interesting.
These two women are directing their rowboat
with separate oars,
nearly everyone else one person rows with both oars at once
so that the boat goes fairly straight.
I like their intelligence.
I like the daring of their experiment.
So we transfer the expectation of physical continuity onto identity
and you can see in the strange and partly lethal backwaters
of identity politics and gender politics
a nascent awareness of the dangers of presuming the continuity
or predictability of gender or identity.
Problem is with that is it should remain actually fluid
and once you militarize that domain,
you're going to suffer ironic, what,
and misunderstandings and prosecutions and indictments
and all of this really dangerous distraction from liberation.
So the first lethal fiction is that you're merely human.
This doesn't mean that you get to just make shit up
and become like a woo goddess.
There are people who walk around saying that they're kings and queens
because they have a male or a female body
or they are goddesses or whatever.
Without access to the more than merely human domains of our nature
is dependent on various kinds of integrity and humility.
If you are arrogant and you celebrate arrogance
and pump up, inflate your personal identity and your ego,
the universe will grind you up
and spit out the little bits of tooth and bone that remain
with very few exceptions.
So I personally, there's a lot of wind here right now.
There could be some noise.
I have the mic buffer on so bear with me.
You have no patience for this kind of nonsense.
Myself, if you find it attractive or interesting,
well see if it serves you.
It's the opposite of what I'm talking about.
Integrity means honesty.
And yes, we are vastly more than human,
but to that more is in service of the history and future of all beings.
It's not in service to the preservation of Darren's name
or my individual prosperity or wealth.
We can see in our cultures another terrifying fiction,
which is that the goal is the fulfillment of individual egoic personal desires
and liberations from cultural structures via catastrophic wealth.
That's a game, that's a vampiric game,
where the death and suffering of billions of others
builds up fortunes in individual and corporate bank accounts.
The fiction there is that it's the personal identity
and individual fulfillment of a single human being
that is the most valuable thing, the righteous thing,
the thing you're supposed to do,
the thing that if you don't do someone else will,
go to the bottom, perverse incentives, all of this.
That leads to dead planets and nightmares,
tyrants and false demigods,
Bezos, Musk, Epstein, Maxwell,
the US military industrial complex,
Google, Twitter, Facebook, Instagram,
TikTok, Pinterest,
the swarming list of lethal vampiric nightmares
just keeps exploding into new malignant mutations,
each one more powerful and accelerated than the last.
It's cancer protocol.
But the fiction is that the endless unfulfillability
of individual identity and power is righteous, appropriate and true.
This is the opposite of what I'm saying.
Real fulfillment has its root in a kind of divine equanimity.
Not the concept of equality, not lip service.
And equalities isn't even the right idea.
It's flowing transcendental mutuality.
Fame is so often a devastating and miserable outcome
of the developmental potentials of a human being.
And many of the famous have painfully come to understand this
at absolutely terrifying prices.
I have an essay called
The Factories of Emptiness about this on my Medium page.
There's a lot of cheering up on top of the strawberry hill here.
So yeah, that's one of the fictions that personal fulfillment.
Now look, fundamentally there's no problem with
lift your boat and bring the tide that raises all the boats around you.
If it actually raises them,
and if that commitment doesn't become compromised
as it becomes more successful.
We can see historically Google's mandate
Don't Be Evil became the opposite of their mandate.
And presently you have a slavering, drooling malignancy
at the top of the food chain
just obliterating the history and future of humanity and nature and so forth.
While pretending to a greatness that can't be had by villains
yet can be mimicked.
The fourth fiction.
That we are trapped on a backwards planet called Earth.
The humans are certainly backwards.
Our cultures are insane.
Nightmarish monsters.
They're not human.
We'll get to that shortly as the fifth fiction.
But what I want you to understand is that this is all the worlds.
All of the intelligences in time space.
Meaning in the future and in every place in the universe
are accessible from here.
This is a transceiver.
The forms you see around you.
Of the organisms.
The microorganisms, the viruses, all these things.
The plants.
The forests.
The hyper structures of organismal synergy
that we refer to with the term ecologies.
These are instancings.
Of the forms and modes of cooperative transcendence throughout time space.
Everything you could possibly imagine or want
is directly accessible from right here.
Your body, right where you're sitting.
Nothing requires travel.
And travel can quickly become ironic.
And, you know, the opposite of...
productive of the opposite of what travel hopes for.
The gurus and yogis know what I am saying.
We imagine that when Buddha says,
Oh, I've had... I have remembered.
I've had the anamnesis of my million previous lifetimes.
We presume that what he may have meant
was a linear anamnesis backward in time.
It occurs to no one, nearly no one,
that what he meant was something more like
all these lives here.
All these lives alive now.
All these lives that have been previously alive.
These are my spirit.
They are my mind. They are my body.
They are my mother. They are my father.
They are my children.
They are my dreaming.
They are my love.
What's actually going on here
is, first of all, incomplete.
So when you...
So the language is wrong.
There isn't anything actually going on
because the idea that there are things
that are actually the case
is a result of that first fiction.
The transfer of the continuity
of physical objects in space
to all other domains of being.
It's not true.
Much of what is going on
is not a state.
It's an array of transforming potentials
synergistically producing the appearance
of a stable situation.
That appearance is false.
It is another of the fictions.
The appearance of a stable situation.
Not true.
Deceptive, slave-making nonsense
in consciousness.
Useful for very pragmatic concerns
and purposes.
I want to build a bed out of wood.
Useful.
Stable state.
Mind.
I want to shoot a bullet
and kill my neighbor.
Useful.
I don't want that.
But if somebody has this desire,
right?
Useful.
Useful for war.
Useful for commerce.
Useful for allopathic medicine.
The kind we use doctors and hospitals
to purvey.
Useful for mechanistic science,
engineering, computation, so forth.
Lethal
to our actual potentials in origin
when implemented
by dissociated, insane processes
that have captured
our
collectivity
and expectation.
So this is all the world.
When a child is born here,
if you gave them a UFO,
it's just like the story of Superman
where Carl L,
knowing that his world is about to be destroyed
by earthquakes
due to transformations in the local
and stellar environment,
puts his child, their child,
into a spacecraft
and sends it to Earth
to grow and be born here.
That is the story of every human child
on this world.
We come from space-time.
This planet is all the world.
When a child is born here,
what they will traverse in existence
is very similar to...
It's not similar.
It's the hyperstasis.
It's the superposition over
what would happen
in an actual spaceship
sent to another planet
that was inhabited by something.
This world is all the worlds.
Your travel here
is travel in space-time.
It appears local.
It isn't local.
There's nothing local about it.
Or rather, the fragment of it
which is reliably local
is, again, perhaps...
It's less than 1%.
It's very reliable that less than 1%.
As far as expectation,
ambiguity, and prediction goes,
seems like it's made of concrete,
that 1%.
It's super reliable, but wildly incomplete.
And so, too, are the natures
and potentials of our human lives
which appear to be individual yet or not.
They are for the sake of all beings.
We incarnate for the sake of all beings,
as well as our own sake.
We come here
on heroic missions
that are quickly forgotten
as we are indoctrinated
in modernity's languages
and in actions of enculturation.
So, yeah.
This is the fourth fiction.
This is all the worlds.
A lifetime here is a transit through space-time,
encountering many other worlds,
many other universes,
becoming other worlds and universes,
together, within for each other,
and the history and future of all beings.
And the sake of their liberation
from pain and suffering
and impoverishment.
It doesn't look that way on the surface.
It looks like the opposite.
We come here to participate in pain,
suffering, enslavement, and impoverishment
of ourselves and others.
And we torture the animals.
We buy meat at the grocery store.
All of these things, they are bad.
Of course, they are bad.
For those of us that live in cities,
they are sort of necessities.
So, the city starts the problem.
You can see that the problem begins
at the collective level
and is transmitted into the personal level,
order, or register, if you will.
There's going to be some wind for a minute
while I wander around this.
I'll pause and reflect on the fifth fiction.
Okay, the fifth fiction
is that aggregates
of human collectives
are people.
That the government is a person,
that the corporations are persons.
There was a catastrophic data breach
at AT&T recently.
And I read nonsense
language in the media.
The privacy of our clients
is our fundamental concern.
We're filled with regret
and so forth.
We heard similar nonsense
from Boeing,
whose catastrophic commercial
grifting and cheating
resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people.
We hear the same nonsense
from Exxon Mobil
when, you know, some pipeline bursts
and vast portions of the ocean
are obliterated by poison.
We hear this nonsense constantly.
Trump pretends to be a human being
with a political identity,
when, in fact, he's just a fucking parasite.
He's a highly advanced parasite.
And others will say,
well, Biden's even worse.
I doubt it, but it doesn't really matter.
The point is, fictional humans aren't humans.
Corporations can't have emotions.
They don't have regret.
They don't have compassion.
They don't have altruism.
Small groups of humans
can express altruistic gestures
as collectives.
Small groups of humans
can be human
until they're captured by commerce
or power in the market,
and then it's basically
just straight-up monsters.
Lying, right?
But what I want to be really clear about
is that representations
of human collectivity
that are dead inside
cannot have emotions.
And when they say we regret,
they're just fucking lying.
It's impossible for Google
to regret something.
Right?
It's impossible for them to feel shame.
They don't have emotions.
When they say they're expressing emotions,
they are lying.
Straight-up lying.
There's no such thing as that.
Corporations are not people.
They don't have rights.
They can't be imprisoned.
There's no real structure
to shut them down when they
behave omnisidely
or catastrophically or viciously,
or just profiteeringly.
Right?
I mean, everybody's just going to say,
like, look, this is a war over profit.
As long as we win the war,
whatever you can get away with goes.
And damn the graveyards of children.
Do you see the same kinds of thing
going on
in the countries that are at war right now?
They don't care about human beings?
At all.
They have some principle or idea in mind,
some protocol
that they're enacting,
as they slaughter children and women
and fathers and grandfathers and grandmothers
and whole lineages of human history,
just obliterating them.
They think they have an argument in favor of this?
What possible argument
could a human being have for that?
None.
If they were human, they could not do that.
So the idea that our collectives
are intelligently oriented
or humane or human
or trustworthy
or worthy of our service
or attention
or authorization is
bullshit.
The fifth fiction.
Now
there are many more fictions.
They all have to do with
limitations.
That you're not telepathic.
That you are telepathic.
Both are fictions.
The actual path
between them is intimacy,
not declaration.
Right? Intimacy.
Intimacy.
Sensitive mutual synergy
for noble and amnoetic
unforgettable purposes
to remember together.
To rediscover
the potentials and natures
of our origins and intelligences,
our transcendent
aspects.
The beyond of the human
that we came here to bring
into physical reality.
To catalyze,
to impregnate,
to fertilize, to potentiate
here on earth.
There are many more fictions.
Now,
your mission
should you choose to accept it
is to take the fictions
I presented here
and invert them
in your consciousness,
evaluation, thought,
behavior, relationships,
experiments, arts,
creativity,
remembering, dreaming,
adoring, awakening,
experience.
If you know the falsehoods,
you can forge the keys
and if you know two or three of them
you can forge a very powerful key.
I've given you five here today.
There are many more.
We will continue to explore them together.
We were born
to unforgettable
the ways and beauty
and shining holy
origins
of our nature,
potentials
and the missions that we incarnate
to pursue together.
Let us not forget them.
Let us never counterfeit them.
Let us correct
wherever we begin
to forge biases
or declarative
errors.
Let us
not know
but learn.
Let us
not tell but see
together
for each other.
In any situation
where we have the agreement to see
better
rather than to defend
the books of our
previous thought
concern,
belief and bias
wherever we shall
agree to see better together
for the sake of each other
in our world
we will succeed.
The sixth fiction is that
we are alone
in the universe.
We are not alone here on earth
but we are nothing like alone in the universe.
Our people were born
in
intimate symbiotic relationship
with non-human intelligences.
First, those here
around us on earth
or perhaps first those in the sky
that may have actually forged
our forms
because we are certainly not the result of
merely natural
mechanical evolution on earth.
No chance of that.
The sixth fiction is that
we are alone
and the seventh is that you are alone.
The universe is filled with
anciently
astonishing transcendent minds
and they participate
directly
in the formation of living worlds.
Without them
you would not be able to understand my language
you would not have anything like a mind.
In order to have a mind you have to be
touching the basis
of the transcendent origin
of consciousness
and that's a link
that could never be broken.
Never.
It might perhaps be briefly interrupted
if it were interrupted for long
everything that you understand as you would permanently be gone
and I don't think that's even possible.
So
the sixth fiction
is that humans are alone
the seventh is that you are alone
there's no chance of that
the eighth is that we're the dominant form
of life on earth
we are certainly
the most dangerous and lethal form
of life on earth
and in the sense
of being omnicidally
dissociated
from lived relation
with nature
if that's
what dominance means then we're dominant in that sense
and we are dominant
in the sense that we can destroy everything here
without too much trouble
but we are not the dominant form of life
the dominant form of life
is probably cells
bacteria
protozoa
single-celled animals, protists and so forth
and in terms of number the dominant form of life
is probably viruses
so these are the fictions I will outline
today
I hope you find them useful
and medicinal
insightful and helpful
inspiring
in learning to see them
we can begin to forge
their opposites
in thought, concern, consciousness, relation
and behavior
and that direction
lies the hope of the future
of our species and world
I'm so grateful to have this time
