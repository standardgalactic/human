Hey everybody. So I'm running out of sunlight, as if sunlight were a commodity that collects
inside me and it's been leaking. Now I accidentally overused my battery in a phone call to my
friend Andre who lives in South Korea where he is a teacher. And we talked about stuff related to
entropy and something he's referring as centropy and other very complex
ideas and we had a lot of fun. It was a great conversation. And I'm not sure how much time I
have tonight with light because behind me, in my neighborhood which we call the sunset,
the sun is doing what my neighborhood is named for and I'm at an intersection where I'm heading
over to the park or rather the garden that I love. But in order to do that, I've got to wait for
lights to change. It's interesting isn't it that if you think carefully about our lives, you'll discover
that machines have an unimaginably sophisticated impact on us.
Most of our parents probably would never have met if not for their relationships with traffic
lights. Those lights back there, let's see, can we see them from here? Yeah, I think there's one.
Those things and many other machines determine where we will be at certain times and where we
won't be at certain times and what opportunities we may encounter or not encounter and what threats
we might encounter or not encounter and all kinds of crazy stuff. And long ago in my 20s,
a friend of mine named Gary Paolini and I, we composed like an industrial opera called Traffic
Signal Man about a guy who believed that both that car license plates were
synchromistical messages to him and that he could tell the future by reading traffic signals. So he
would spend his days at a specific intersection reading both the car license plates and coupling
that reading with the synchronization offered by the additional input of traffic signal timing.
And now I'm in the garden that I love, this little garden. Though the main garden that I love is
closed. And here's the beautiful Brugamencia, there's a couple of them here. They are plants that
are ordinarily pollinated at night. I think jasmine is a similar kind of plant, so they become extremely
fragrant in the evening. However, the ones here, as I mentioned yesterday, have had most of their
flowers snipped off. So what I want to talk about today, which has been on my mind all day
and been waiting to make this video, and I don't know if I have enough time, so we'll give it my
best shot, is the division between the public and the private, which is similar to the division
between the general and the specific. When people like myself use the word we ordinarily,
they're referring to some kind of generalization. And when they use the word I or me, they're
referring to an individual. And unfortunately for most of us, our thinking about these topics
is incredibly primitive. It's so primitive that it almost doesn't qualify as thinking.
It qualifies as a unique kind of cognitive disease.
Just saying hello to my favorite plants here, this white sage, that also had all its flowers
snipped off by some idiotic gardener. So
when we think about phenomenon and we use tokens, words, to refer to phenomenon,
there's a couple of very important things going on that most of us are unaware of.
The first is that we're using abstractions. So the idea that
that is a tree is an abstraction. Tree is an abstraction of sophisticated process
of matching phenomenon to verbal categories and using tokens to point at phenomenon in nature
and in our experience. And so I'm going to go to the great big lot here.
So when we use language, we're manipulating abstractions. We're actually imposing
a representational layer on top of our experience as animals. My apologies for the traffic noise.
It's uncontrollable. Hopefully the phone doesn't pick up as much of it as I hear. That's how it
seems to be from my experience yesterday. So most of us are unconscious of abstractions in
that we confuse either we don't notice that we're abstracting or we confuse the
tokens that we use to point at phenomenon with the phenomenon themselves. So that
I think those are actually trees. They aren't. Those are phenomenon so sophisticated
that they might be more sophisticated than everything humans have ever learned about anything.
I don't know how sophisticated they are. Our knowledge about any phenomenon in nature,
any phenomena, I always get the plural wrong on that. I can't remember which is the plural
and which is the singular of phenomenon. I think phenomena is the plural but I can't remember.
In any case, the fact that we have tokens about phenomena
implies to us, unfortunately, that we understand them or that our understanding of them
is relatively complete when in fact the absolute opposite is the case. What we have is a very modest
grasp on some phenomenon that we can distinguish like a tree or trees. We have classes that comprise
sets. So there's the set of vegetable organisms or vegetation organisms that belong in the set of
vegetation. And then we have instances like trees or a birch tree or a cedar tree, so on and so
forth. So we have this really sophisticated classification system. We've got all these tokens
and most of us are not aware that when we're using language we're participating in a habit
that places an overlay on experience and divides it up various ways for various reasons and
stuff like this. Now sometimes we're aware that we're making an abstraction when, for example,
we make a model. We may know or realize or be aware that a model isn't the same thing as the
phenomenon to which it refers. In other words, one of the conveniences of being able to model
things is that we're incapable of including all the information about any phenomenon, even the
simplest phenomenon, except maybe phenomenon in language. In that one instance we might be able
to include most or all of the information because language is an overlay we invented and it's
relatively simple, by which I mean compared to the things language encodes it's relatively simple.
So when we're using language we're engaged in forming abstractions and we might be aware that
we're doing that when we use a model because we realize that the model doesn't contain all of
the information about the subject or referent or in formal terms the nominatum of like that which
it points to. So we understand that models don't contain all the information about that which
they model, right? A simulation doesn't contain all the information about that which it simulates.
In fact to contain all the information about anything you'd probably have to
to you'd probably have to include all the information about everything because
somewhere you make a division between that distinguishes a phenomenon or an event or
situation so on and so forth. Somewhere you with your mind you make cuts in the everything
and we use language and actually categories are the first cut that we make and then instances
are usually the second cut just as when I say there are there's everything there are organisms
there are plants animals there's vegetation there's microorganisms there's viruses
so on and so forth right we're making slices in the everything but those slices are not
uh intrinsic to the stuff we're cutting up with our minds and if we were aware of making those cuts
we could do it much more intelligently than we ordinarily do. Furthermore if we were aware that
we are in a playground in a sandbox of abstractions
we would again avoid many catastrophic errors of thought and ideation and opinion and perspective
and so on.
It would be amazing if when we'd been endowed with the capacity to
to use language and to engage in conceptual thought we had been trained about the dangers
and the pitfalls and the confusions that come along with that. Ordinarily if you're going to
give a child something that's dangerous you teach them how to use that thing intelligently so they
don't injure themselves or others or the universe or the world with it. In the case of language
apparently most of the adults don't realize how incredibly dangerous it is
and the vast majority of adults are completely unconscious of these dangers
and are not only not only do they not teach their children about them they're incapable of
recognizing them themselves unless they are trained to do so and there are various ways
one can become trained in this one can study semantics and linguistics
which could help you but won't necessarily give you the medicine you need. There's the very exotic
sorry I have the hiccups and slightly insane work that I nonetheless absolutely recommend
if you've got a stomach for it of Alfred Korzybski the founder of general semantics
and what he refers to as non-aristatelian logic
and my friend Nathan Binema is going to be giving some some coursework on on those topics
you can look him up on Facebook I think it's B-I-N-N-E-M-A and there are other people who
might be able to teach you something about general semantics which I think is a extremely
sophisticated analysis of the underlying problems that humans have in relating to each other and
themselves in the world and their own consciousness through language but lately we're in a very unusual
situation and one of the things that's going on in this situation one demonstration of the
problems we have in our relationships with language and knowledge that I wanted to highlight today
is that I think people have a great deal of trouble some people have in some situations
have a great deal of trouble distinguishing between their idea of something and the thing itself
they can't tell the difference and they think those two things are equivalent they think for
example their idea of what's going on is relatively equivalent to what's going on there's no possibility
of that ever being true because whatever what's going on is is so unimaginably sophisticated
that it would be impossible to form an idea that resembles it impossible it will never happen no
one will ever succeed at that and so one of the problems here is that it's very easy to confuse
generalizations with a situation or circumstance and people do this in language all the time they
make generalizations about humans right they'll say for example um oh americans are naive
when really if you got any specific american in front of you um some of them might be naive
about some things and completely not about others and so in fact that statement's kind of ironic
because when someone says something like oh well americans are naive what's actually going on is
that person's naive about language right that person doesn't understand the capacity of language
to completely misdirect our attention our awareness our cognition our potential for intelligence
our opinions our ideas and so on and so forth and because many people in many situations
are confused in this way what we get are these conflicting storms of ever more you know emphatically
insisted upon nonsense particularly right now when people are trying to understand
a sophisticated array of phenomenon right a constellation a constellated array of layered
phenomenon and they're thinking about it as if it's a single thing right so that they'll say something
like they'll use the phrase the coronavirus the coronavirus to refer to a vastly constellated
array of phenomenon behaviors and observations opinions research uh like you could throw anything
in that salad all right um and they're just they think they're inclined to think and suggest
that this is a single phenomenon it can't you can you can speak that way language allows you
to make that kind of mistake but unless you're specifically referring only
to the referent pointed at by the phrase the coronavirus meaning you're you're referring to
a specific viroid SARS-CoV-2 not anything it does not what people do about it none of that unless
you're referring just to that thing you're misusing language and even if you're referring just to
that thing you're probably not conscious of the fact that you're engaging in abstraction
right you're not yet conscious of the fact that you're engaging in abstraction which means
you're using toys verbal toys in a game that refers to some phenomenon that's
incompletely understood by anyone by everyone and you're doing so in a way that at least has the
potential to confuse you into thinking that you know what you're talking about right
and we all do this all day long i'm no i'm no exception even though i have some degree of
consciousness of abstraction of abstracting you know and i have some training in general semantics
so the problem is really complicated because i want to explain something about whatever it is
the coronavirus might refer to
and what i want to say is that first of all
whenever we're talking about something we're at least in part talking about everything
because the something is part of the everything and everything it's not that everything is connected
it's that you start out with the unity right and then you make specifically intentional
purposive cuts in that unity to be able to to distinguish and thus refer to some specific
aspect of the unity right and some potential relationships or causal phenomenon within you
know what you're referring to whatever is going on with the human species and the pathogen that
we currently refer to as the novel coronavirus is an unimaginably sophisticated phenomenon
i can't express the sophistication of this but it's not being captured in our thought or our
opinion or minds at all what we're doing instead is we're pretending that generalizations capture
the phenomenon adequately and they don't that's the problem that's like pretending that um
if you look at humans in general you'll be able to figure out what darin will do in the next two
minutes which you can't um although you might be able to make very simple generalizations
that would be accurate such as he'll probably continue breathing um
so my point here is that
i want to be very clear the phenomenon that we that we refer to with the phrase the coronavirus
is an unimaginably complex phenomenon with ostensibly trillions of variables
and even if we eliminate vast portions of those if we if we you know pair the phenomenon down
to a cognitively and intellectually manageable set of features which is part of how we do science
by the way and how we do medicine because otherwise you have to include everything
which you can't do right think about it someone comes to you they're sick you know well i'm afraid
you're afflicted with the big bang what yes the fact that the universe exists resulted in you
having this illness that's the actual causal factor in what's going on like everything is the cause
of you right everything is what what would you exclude causally from your state right everything
is involved um so we pair things down right and we say well um there's a pathogen and we do
very specific testing to determine whether or not this pathogen is associated with the syndrome
right the the complex constellation of uh symptoms and effects we can observe which is
always incomplete because we don't see all the symptoms or effects not even in a single person
ever right there will always be symptoms and effects always that are unobservable to us because
either um they're too numerous uh we have not discovered how to distinguish them right we can't
perceive them um the human body is so astonishingly complex there's all kinds of cells in the body that
we haven't even discovered yet including immune cells and so on so our knowledge is always partial
it's always incomplete this is particularly true in a very complex situation like the one we're in
at present um and most of what's going on is unknown right we've got a handle on of some very
tiny pieces of this puzzle we being human society uh and primarily that subset of society composed
of medical researchers theorists um molecular biologists virologists epidemiologists um physicians
nurses and other medical practitioners who have some actual education and and uh experience
of the phenomenon that we all are suddenly very concerned about
so it's a mistake to presume for example that because social distancing worked
and was sufficient in one place that it will always work and always be sufficient
in some other place everything has local variables now that particular assertion
that that if social distancing was effective in reducing the rate of contagion in one place
that that that will likely be true in another that's a relatively reliable assertion
but the assertion that the reverse of that right that people who didn't practice social distancing
in place a and didn't get obliterated over you know 20 days um means that social distancing
was a bad idea that's just not true um the reason it's not true is that
it's the wrong use of a generalization it's a bad use of a generalization there are distinct
features that affect contagion severity of illness um efficacy of treatment efficacy of testing
efficacy of prophylactic measures there are probably locational variables genetic variables
variables in the strain of the virus variables in conditions that we have no no grasp of
that we cannot even represent to ourselves yet so what we have is a big question mark
with some tiny little islands of knowledge that we've managed uh when I say again when I say we I
mean um researchers in general and the societies that are attempting to come to terms with what our
experts are telling us right and there's this vast backlash against expertise right why should
the medical expert's opinion be the one that matters well if you can't understand that
it's difficult to convince it's going to be difficult to convince you otherwise but essentially
when you're in a complex situation with a bunch of variables that you're untrained
in examining what you want hopefully is people with the training to help you understand
and give you you know best evidence uh models of the phenomenon and the reasonably
expectable sequelae or consequences of that phenomenon um you don't want people guessing
you don't want people intuiting it you don't want them you know praying to clouds in the sky about
it you want actual data especially if millions of lives are at risk right and in this case
that's the case millions of lives are at risk many people have already died
people are arguing in ways about this that are both childish and insane and part of the reason
they're doing that is that they're not aware that the phenomenon is incredibly sophisticated
the sophistication of the human immune system so first of all i'm making generalizations there
i'm talking about the human immune system right so i'm talking about a general idea
that i propagate across all human beings yeah but what we need to understand and what i want to
make very clear and in case this isn't obvious from the situation we're in it should be
be each individual organism is just as unique as it is similar to its class that's the key thing
i'm trying to communicate here okay each individual organism is at least as locally unique
as it is similar to the class we use to refer to it with and this is the thing that people
are having a hard time wrapping their minds around they think that because you're the you're human
your gym is just the same as jill well it's not true that's why some people have zero symptoms
and other people die if that's not a significant enough difference for you to understand it's
going to be really hard for me to show you one that will be and this is the the primary thing
that i wanted to communicate today though i think i'm going to run out of time actually i'm going to
run out of light uh so i may i may remake this video we'll see what happens but essentially
what i want to get across to you is the idea that individual instances of a situation are
extremely unique and so the fact that for example some place on earth that doesn't immediately lock
down yet doesn't experience a vast preponderance of infections and deaths in no fucking way
means that it's safe to not lock down what it means at best is that local variables in that
particular place have thus far turned out to produce less uh illnesses and deaths than we
might otherwise have predicted the idea that that's true for all other places because that happened
there is insane and simply incorrect it's provably wrong right you you've got places that have that
have locked down essentially and still have catastrophic illness and death rates you've
got other places that were relatively moderate in their um in their transformation of their social
behavior and don't have significant uh we we we don't see significant statistics from those
places or the statistics appear momentarily to be largely insignificant those statistics
are very fuzzy and they're prone to radical transformation over time and everybody needs
to remain aware that there are unique variables in every in every person in every place in every
location in every city in every village everywhere and those unique variables including initial
inoculation rates initial strains the genetic diversity of the population there and all kinds
of other things um contribute to the outcomes we perceive statistically and those statistical
outcomes are wildly incomplete so you don't want to go around pretending that you understand what
the hell's going on with the coronavirus because you got your hands on some numbers or you read
a news article that's an insane idea what's actually going on is a phenomenon so sophisticated
that that our modern societies are ill equipped to completely understand it let alone you know
that people reading news articles are going to suddenly become paragons of knowledge and be able
to tell you here's what's actually going on this is the real truth that's insane and impossible
that's not true that'll never be true there's no one who understands what's going on the
the complexity of the phenomenon we are presently facing which goes vastly beyond the coronavirus
into you know the history of medical science how human societies function what capitalist
nations do and are about there's like the sophistication is off the charts right so
the main idea that i want to communicate here though is relatively simple and it's this it is that
perspectives based on generalizations and statistics give you only a very modest grasp
on what will actually happen in individual contexts circumstances populations and human beings
each individual place person situation is going to vary and it's going to vary for reasons
some of which we can acquire awareness and intelligence about and some of which must
remain invisible to us because our grasp on phenomenon is necessarily incomplete and language
is prone to deceive us about that that's it for now thanks for joining me bye
