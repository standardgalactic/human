This flowing of the bubbles in the water, the shapes they make, the reflections, the light, time, spirit, mind.
This is also magical. This is also an irracular surface where water transforms and meets light and time.
There is a living way of seeing that is profound and beautiful and holy and ancient.
You can sense it. You can see it. It is beautiful.
