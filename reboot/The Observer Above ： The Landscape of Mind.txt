I've been listening to Daniel Schmockenberger see if I can get this
right. S C H M A C T E N B E R G E R. And I was listening to his two
podcasts which I haven't finished the second one of entitled The War on
Sense-Making presented by Rebel Wisdom. And I have a number of topics on my
mind. We'll see how things turn out in terms of if I can organize them and
integrate them somewhat coherently. But I'll have a go at it. So I have to take a
little bit of risk. The risk of failing or falling down or making mistakes,
getting it wrong, becoming confused, following too closely my framework I
have in mind is a risk and so is following it too loosely. Under ordinary
circumstances we are easily distracted by the peculiar very striking capacity of
our minds. Something I'm going to pose as metaphysical in the sense that no one
can physically grasp the mind or their mind. But the fact that we have this
capacity for complex representational sophistication and that's a word that I
choose very carefully in order to contrast it with intelligence. I make that
contrast because our complex representational sophistication is
entirely distinct from one of its branches. And that branch is the one we
would associate with deep clear broad awareness with creativity symbiosis rather
than a biosis with non-zero sum games with the capacity for arriving at novel
insight leading to trustworthy truthful new opportunities for everyone even for
the living planet. Because whether or not we were endowed by something divine with
the peculiar capabilities our mental interiority present. These capabilities
have invested us with otherwise unimaginable powers. Historically for humans over the last
ten thousand years and extremely so over the last two hundred to five hundred years. This
endowment has resulted in Hamarsha which I might misunderstand the correct definition from the
Greek or is it Latin. Hamarsha is a process whereby through the continuing amplification of hubris
there's a response from the context itself of instantiating processes that are monstrous and
demonic. And often the results of this are apocalyptic and sometimes once in a while they give birth to
heroes. So it's not to lose my train of thought. I'm going to back track a bit to the idea that
we're in the peculiar predicament of being engaged with mind like states and behaviors. And these over
their normal propagation and processes that resemble selection and ecologies can quickly
become so inflated that we cannot maintain the homeostatic balance the coherence of anything
resembling awareness or intelligence or creativity or insight. And in case that sounds paradoxical
paradoxes are usually produced by an erroneous frame collapse meaning that we collapse a complex
frame to a simple one. We collapse a multi-layered constellation of elements to a flat map. And this
process of flattening literally of explanation produces paradoxes and we do it in elegantly.
There are contrasts and conflicts that underpin the possibility the many the broad forests the
jungles of possibility that are our actual inheritance as human means. But these can easily be cruelly
impoverished momentarily for individuals and groups but even over the long spans of epochs and the
developmental phases of our species and what we call our societies. So just as all of you are to some
degree I'm subject to the storms of consciousness even while I'm trying to coherently organize my
thoughts and goals so that I can speak meaningfully about them and articulately if I'm lucky. We're
skillful or both or three things one of which I don't know the name of. So I want to highlight
what I want to call the red herring effect which is the capacity in the mind of a person or
conceivable group to become perilously distracted by the sudden inflation of some subject of attention or
idea, position, campaign, so on. It's a very delicate process to inhabit the position of observer
above the landscapes of mind-like behavior and processes so that instead of being
gravitically drawn into them identifying with them pursuing them with great enthusiasm or vigor
we give things time for the things that are rapidly inflating to either burst or have their energy
drawn away by processes that are more trustworthy not as belligerent and thus less loud. We can
notice for example that in human behavior particularly in relational behavior between groups of people who
actually know each other the the guy who plays the comedian doesn't run around telling everyone how
funny he is. The girl who plays even for a moment these plays may be brief. The artist doesn't go
around telling people why her art is the best. And if the girl's the comedian and the guy's the
artist fine or if you know whoever is whatever fine. But the comedian the comic walks into the
room takes a glance around and within you know a minute everybody in the room is gripping their
guts and trying not to pee their pants and right. The comic enacts rather than declares. The dancer
enacts telling someone you dance is completely dead next to dancing with someone for someone.
Enacted intelligence it doesn't advertise real loud almost never it doesn't need to because it's
inaction is better than than a verbal seduction right or a commercial seduction.
And the same is true in our minds and you know in our own minds and the louder voices
are often the least trustworthy. And they're an attempt to collapse the observer
above all processes down into one of those processes.
And the result is not always but frequently.
Hamarsha in our own minds in our own bodies right. We summon nemesis and then you know
there's this felt sense of great power during the summoning
until the consequences come home and home is obliterated.
Coherence is obliterated liberty obliterated humanity obliterated intelligence obliterated
intelligence is a luxury you have it when you have the space in which to grow it together.
And whether that's together with the various aspects of your psyche and habits and mind or
whether it's together as in the small tightly knit group or a sports team or an acting troupe or an
orchestra together brings symbiotic super function.
The birthplace of heroic acts of beauty humanity grace humility reverence wonder awe
ecstasy freedom from Hamarsha.
Whenever you see layers collapsing whenever when you if you can learn to see the layers of things
right and notice when they start to collapse whether we're talking about layers like
the entire body the nervous system the organs
the brain
the psyche the subconscious the unconscious or actually I got this two backwards
the mind and then the sort of crust right the habits on top of the mind.
This is one way of viewing layers when you see those starting to collapse
it's a good it's a powerful hint that we should pay attention to the result.
And we should be aware that collapses that produce paradox or bipolar opposites
while sometimes useful are extremely inelegant and often harmful.
So I want to highlight this problem with our minds producing a big bubble
that we then collapse into identification with an idea or a mandate a declaration
an agenda a campaign.
And it isn't to say by a long shot that no campaign is a good campaign
though some might equate that with being more sensitive to the actual complexity in relationships
than if we were to collapse it down to a thing and then identify collapse ourselves into that thing.
I want to just highlight that
as a red herring is something that pulls us aside from our actual liberty
potential for deep and meaningful learning and awareness and growth for creativity and play.
And because humans are social animals as people around us begin to collapse into positions
we become more inclined to go with that flow and if the positions are bipolar
maybe in the sense more analogous to the pathology
than the mathematical analogy.
We might get really stuck here's why.
We're likely to fall victim to a false dichotomy
and thus be forced to choose between two really bad choices. Give you an example.
Suppose the idea of voting
could be reasonably a flaw with it could be pointed out by by making an analogy and the analogy is
you can either have a new heart or new lungs.
Now if that were actually possible it would be wildly bizarre metabolically but
the idea that you either get to have a heart or you get to have lungs no one would sign up for that.
Because hearts don't work without lungs and if the heart works better the lungs work better and
if the lungs work better the heart works better and it's not you see it's not a competitive dichotomy
it's a synergistic dichotomy.
But what we're faced with is something even weirder.
You can either have a new fake heart or you can get new fake lungs
that inherit all kinds of problems and diseases and bizarre artifacts and
conflicts to the degree that they actually aren't either neither hearts nor lungs.
And that's more like the situation we're in in the United States circa 2020.
We have to vote for one of two really dangerously deceptive manipulative
monsters and then collapse into identification with one of these one of the other of these choices
and if we don't make a choice well we can be seen as part of the problem which problem though.
I noticed something really peculiar
and it was rewarding briefly to notice it when I was listening to the Rebel Wisdom podcast
with Daniel Schmockenberger.
The producers did something that in this case represents both a very bold experiment
and the possibility of a profound optimization or transformation of common practice.
And if you're not aware of this immediately
it might not be apparent though you'll wonder why there's music every once in a while.
What they do is they occlude the question that they're asking Daniel with music
probably 96% of the time every once in a while you hear a question.
And by doing so
they could be understood to be introducing intelligent ambiguity and also
they're retreating from the limelight right. The podcasters don't become stars
they become sources of gravity that draw
amazing articulations in Daniel's case but take no credit for having done so.
It's a very peculiar altruistic strategy. I was really surprised when I figured out that's what
was going on and perhaps you know I'm clumsy and I should have noticed it immediately I did notice
the music it just didn't click in my mind that those pauses of music between Daniel's topics
represented their questions. But this reminds me too of the observer above
the landscape of mental processes right. They don't have to have a face
they don't need a name or it doesn't need a name.
And it's not precisely impartial but it's very cautious about collapsing into what it's observing
because that preserves crucial assets that are otherwise offloaded into costs and damage and
danger and illness and injury and war and conflict which are in fact generally unnecessary.
I've heard occasionally people say well you have amazing ideas Darren but can you show me an actual
example of them it's not too difficult your body. To the degree elements of your body whether these
are single cells or neurons or organs bones mental constructs no I'm gonna leave those out let's go
to the body. To the degree that they can be understood to be distinct
we find primarily
that's the result of the imposition of a framework that wants to make parts out of holes.
But your body wasn't assembled from parts in fact it wasn't assembled at all
I might say it was expressed by the entire history and perhaps even the future of life on earth
all of the beings.
But they don't compete against each other for resources and if they did anything even vaguely
resembling what what the organs of the simulated anatomy of one of our cultures did
if they competed and engaged in zero sum games you probably wouldn't live more than a few seconds.
So why isn't everything dead?
Before I answer that question
the elements of the body and I mean there are trillions of cells
countless viruses
it isn't as though there's nothing like conflict
because we experience illness and our immune systems can be understood it's not the only
way to think of them as brains or armies but it's very sophisticated and the immune system
is unimaginably sophisticated our grasp on it is extremely primitive so far for all we have learned
and
the health and well-being of all of the elements depends upon the health and well-being of all
of the elements so with the exceptions of the intrusion of injury you know of illness or injury
in which case things shift a bit
we have a functionally auto altruistic right it's naturally altruistic my health increases your
health union it's a unity first and the idea of there even being separate parts is sort of an
intellectual add-on that is not entirely unrelated to us reifying organisms in the image of the
machines we make though there were different understandings of elements or parts prior to
the onset of machines in ancient cultures there's plenty of evidence for that
this garden is not tearing itself apart
it's not sacrificing its past or future to kill all the other things
so that one plant can propagate wildly though there are plants that propagate wildly
war might be the wrong metaphor for that i might prefer to view it as a kind of innate opportunism
that got expressed evolutionarily but it's not my intent to talk in depth about this subject
i merely wanted to say that
if your body had to pick a party you'd be dead and there's all kinds of sophisticated symbiotic
interplay that produces unimaginable super function every second of your life you don't have one eye
you have two and i'm cribbing a little bit from daniel here one eye doesn't give you peripheral
vision doesn't give you depth you know two eyes having both of them really good thing
but they're not in conflict your eyes aren't fighting each other in fact they're part of
they're an aspect of a very sophisticated network that's capable of all kinds of astonishing
things that don't even make any sense really in terms of trying to break them down into constituent
elements so one of my examples is just your body or your hand the fact that i have different you
know digits they're each one unique um
and i have two of these amazing things
right they don't they don't get in fights with each other it's never happened
not even one time did my pinky say well that index finger is so dang long that
you know my sovereignty right um well what's the sovereignty of a pinky
its identity belongs first to unity it excels first in union with other beings
and this is the nature of nature fundamentally
now because we are representational animals we can do this other crazy ass thing this wide
array of other crazy ass things that depart from unity
in a way that is not dissimilar to how cancer cells
depart from the symbiotic union of the body and it should be clear
that when these must must metastasize
the
extreme individuality the refusal to pass away the refusal to belong the urge for eternal life
as an individual takes over
and we get haemarsha nemesis apocalypse
it's very ironic and paradoxical
that the urge for immortality kills you this is from eric weinstein
and success at immortality turns you into a giant tumor
or rather you have immortality because you die right
for the first one yeah that's I think what he said something I'm paraphrasing slightly
the human minds comprise a hyper system that's hyper connected and it's connected in ways we
don't even have words for though it's also connected by technologies including the technology
of speaking words writing things making videos and so on but I want you to understand that
the things or I want you to entertain the idea actually that the things that we see
as the connectors in the networks are less than half of the connectors in the networks
and that many of those connectors are inconceivable to us
that the humanity
maybe like the world that spawned it is a super organism first
society is only abstractly
and individuals when it breaks down
see in your body if your cells had to act as individuals they'd be dead right away
in the sense of truly individuated from the body right separated from the body
receiving only the merits of their own work
and contributing nothing to the merits of others right that's a dead cell
but maybe that analogy isn't all that great
though it's important to understand that
it's the unity of discreet conceivably discreet members that produces super function
and I'm suggesting that humanity is first a super organism and I will suggest
that the earth the living ecologies of earth represents something above organism not below it
that we don't even have a reasonable word for
um
and that the ecologies of earth including mankind
human humanity excuse me um I can't get away from it
including homo sapiens I hope there's no way around it there are ways around it
but uh our species is an organ in ecology it's not outside it
except abstractly and some of our behaviors act from outside
so that
there are
invisible transports in the networks that unify all human minds and I would further suggest
because I'm radical that they extend both into the past of humanity and into the future
some of these transports for sure some of them do
in fact what we call evolution is one way of understanding
a relatively materialistic one way of very partially understanding
a relatively materialistic aspect of the transports from the connect us to the past in the future
but I suspect it's even weirder than that I suspect somehow it's possible to change the past from here
in any case
there are storms in the cognizium in the network of human minds but they are first unities first
they are one from this perspective I suggest and just like a single mind right what is the
observer position above the human cognizium the cognizium of our species can individuals
access that I believe yes can they meaningfully access it yes I think so
not probably before can they consciously access it that's a trickier question the answer to that
one is not probably before they become aware of the possibility of it however that's also partially
true answer because there are aspects of our ordinary cognition including my capacity to put
sentences together moment to moment right now that I suspect derived from my participation
in the cognizium of our species in the the unity mind of of our people all the people
but because I think we are representational animals because we have this extra layer
of both potential and danger
our people
are constantly misdirected confused paradoxically self-threatened other threatened
and all of these little abstract barriers arise between us first in thought then in action
or thought speech action and of course we're capable of
of flipping that polar polarity right so that our thoughts speech and behavior encourage
and recognize the fundamental interdependence not merely of all of the participants in our
species but of all of life on earth extended all the way back as far as you care into history
and all the way forward into the future
nature is far too complex to characterize easily though I will occasionally take that risk
but symbiosis trumps competition not necessarily an evolutionary theory and I'm not dismissing that
theory in the moment to moment survival of my actual body and my capacity to form coherent
mind states and reach for awareness and insight and wonder learning intelligence and play
now
I'm going to close with
a perspective on intervals which is a continuation from my last videos topic
as I mentioned a moment ago I think it's useful to consider our world
as meta to the class of thing for sure and meta to the class of organism
and we don't really have good language for any of this or if there is I'm not yet aware of it
so it's a super being
and it has senses that are embodied as you and me and every living thing on the planet
and those senses are also its organs and when they're damaged it suffers and when they thrive it
thrives and it has something better than a mind and it's not concerned with words
except if one of its children starts making them in a way that causes everything to collapse
then it might be maybe become concerned but my point is that for a living world
the interval of a day is infinitesimally small
if earth had a heartbeat an actual heartbeat right it would probably be like well we might
imagine it to be something like one pulse per thousand years or something like this
or ten thousand years
and the reason that I'm saying this is that
I believe the earth has something analogous to senses and experience and feel something
meta to well-being awareness consciousness
but the intervals of her temporality are extremely long by our standards
and this is part of why most change is gradual
right and happens over very long periods of time
evolution is a process that happens a little faster
in organisms and very fast in some organisms and blazingly fast in very tiny organisms
partly because there are so many more vehicles in the microbes than there are at the animal scale
but those evolutions are linked
so for the earth a meaningful interval a very very small meaningful interval
might be a thousand years
and change most of the time in the homeostatic basis of life on earth
is also gradual that can be radically affected by events we would refer to as catastrophic
such as the sudden emission of vast amounts of methane into the atmosphere
strikes by extraterrestrial bodies such as asteroids or large rocks or ice
um changes in the relationship with the sun many of which we don't even again have language about
changes possibly in the local context of time space which we know nothing about
essentially nearly nothing and finally
the possibility
that one organism will go haywire and start wiping out everything that moves and most of what doesn't
now in earth's time scales the catastrophic obliteration of the ecologies
that is the result primarily of human
commercial and war activity over the past hundred years is absolutely unprecedented
although we can go really far back and find a precedent which I'll return to a little bit
our species has become
self and other obliterating
like a child who sells his own organs to black marketeers to buy an ipad
or some heroin and then just keeps doing that until there's no more person no more life
we've been offloading the damage
of our industrial and commercial and war activity onto the ecologies
if we did something like that in our own bodies
to an equivalent extent again we would not live one minute
and as Daniel argues there's something similar going on in the domain of human
representational intelligence right where we're engineering diseases that masquerade is useful
information affecting each other with with them forming little protector networks for them engaging
in narrative warfare essentially obliterating the possibility of coherence of our you know thought
and aspect that relates with ideology
we're obliterating our capacity for sensing truthfulness and for behaving truthfully
and most of that is in the name of convenience and by the way all that representational stuff
that game what we do is we offload the the necessity of paying clear attention
focused aware attention inhabiting the position above the landscape of mental activity
we're offloading that so that we can stop doing it into
a little framework or idea or concept or fear or motivation
and then we collapse into that
the result right we collapse into the result for convenience
in order to skip relating in order to skip time in order to throw away
dimensions of relational opportunity and intelligence
by the bushel right just burn those up to produce a little artifact not unlike a religious symbol
that we can sort of trust in right so we can excuse ourselves
mostly unconsciously most of this isn't conscious
from being present
from embodied awareness from participatory insight and relation
and while that works as a strategy in a lot of domains it leads to machines
and war a terrible disease though it occasionally also positively affects those diseases
with the immunological discoveries and so on
it causes a whole shit fire of nightmares
but it's very convenient there's nothing more convenient than offloading
your capacity now if we take convenience to mean just getting rid of right it's totally
inconvenient if we look at the results and discover oh shit that gets everything killed
including me right that's not convenient so maybe we should say it presents the visage of convenience
it's
and occasionally embodies it usefully right but a vast portion of that activity
is hiding hammarsha the production of nemesis and apocalypse and we're trading that not for
true convenience truthful convenience but for temporal and behavioral convenience
I don't have to do the thing the machine does the thing I take care of the machine
right the the idea does the thing I propagate the idea
the you know political party does the thing I endorse the political party
I don't cook food I don't compose food I eat it I don't create music I purchase it
I don't write stories I read them I don't live stories I'm interested in consuming them
now none of these are absolutes all of this stuff's fairly fuzzy and there are exceptions
and I'm not meaning in any way to be an absolutist which carefully examines sounds almost like
absolutism doesn't it except that I'm leaving a big open door right for the exceptions and recognizing them
so the red herrings and the weaponized information even in our own minds
that causes us to collapse from the observer who isn't impartial but is fully endowed with
the assets and opportunities that are natural to our humanity that's what I mean by this observer
because they have not yet collapsed right into identification with some project or idea or task
or distraction or convenience we can move together from the landscape of mental processes
to the landscape not the landscape to the atmosphere
of mutually concerned beings capable of embodying the assets and faculties and potentials
that are the most precious endowments of our species and our role our roles in the history
of life on earth of our species and of the future of life on earth
and if we can merely move in that direction right if we consent set our compass
thus thus word
our lives and our experience of life our minds and our experience of mental behavior and processes
transforms almost immediately it can take time it doesn't transform completely overnight
though there are exceptions again
so it seems to me hope lies in that direction we have examples all around us of that
and we can form examples moment to moment with each other even if their interval is very small
in which we do precisely that and we love it it's really fun it's a lot better than any
other game that's on the table most of which involve having to collapse down to a pointy
little weapon pointed at the opposite you know the enemy or a really round shield that's very thick
pointed at everything
the earth's intervals are small
the time over the span over which humans have been ripping the ecologies to shreds
and making billions of machines it's less than 200 years
the earth had the intuition something was wrong
in in this in this parable that i'm spinning
about 50 years ago
and that's when it started to leak into human consciousness that hey these ecologies maybe
maybe it's not a good idea to rip them to shreds and build giant warships and atomic bombs and
billions of cars and things right
so the human cognizium is not distinct from the the hypercognizium of life on earth right
um we're just pretty dense you know you don't tend to get the message when it comes through
and also we tend to be listening in language and the world the world speaks in languages that
kind that far predate words perhaps in us the world speaks most
excessively in feelings and senses
so it's been a very short process but the earth is certainly concerned
aware meta aware meta concerned again we don't have language for
the processes in beings above the order of beings but earth is one of those
and i must presume i'm going to gender the earth female as it's common in my
traditional language to do so i'm going to preserve presume that she uh not merely has
feelings and intuitions and senses she has friends she has friends that adore her
and are of kinds again we don't even have language for and one of those friends is the sun
so if something starts killing off the earth wiping out her organs
her friends if necessary if that if that being or process isn't
self uh delineating right doesn't cause itself to stop
then in other words if it doesn't by itself produce nemesis and auto apocalypse
then other forces intervene right so that's the same way well no in a way meta analogous to
you know we humans have doctors and surgeons and we have other healers too
um and some of them seem metaphysically powerful
and some of those are frauds but not all of them are
magic
the ongoing development and experience of
unexpected staggering super function comes from unity
but if we should actually choose
to demonstrate directly
with our physical and emotional and psychological and mental behavior
that we are outside nature
in that case
all fans become made of shit
shit doesn't hit the fan now you just got shit fans
we it is as if there are a hundred invisible umbilicae umbilicuses that connect each one
of us and our species to the living world we've been hacking away at those things we don't need
that we're above all this for hundreds of years less than an eye blink in terrestrial history
i'm sure you see the implications of what i presented so i won't present them concretely
i'll just say that in earth time we've been misbehaving for a long time but our species
has been catastrophically misbehaving um for a good couple of hundred years
which probably isn't even equivalent to a second of the world's experience
but the world knows something's wrong and the animals and plants are changing
they're adapting to the new situation almost as if they can predict it
or so it sometimes seems to me
the beauty of life on earth
is most coherently expressed in us
as humility not hubris
the grace the epic adventure of the living beings on this world over time floating through space
are our origin
and we i say
have not merely a responsibility or an obligation we have the privilege
of walking in beauty and humility awe and reverence wonder and altruistic ecstasis
on the face of a mystery so profound that language and concepts will never encompass it
and perhaps if we could bear this in our hearts and minds
a little more often a little more continuously each day
perhaps we could cure the catastrophic injury and illness presently dominating
the human cognizium and the history and future of life on our world
but even if we were to fail at that goal
i trust this setting on the compass
i don't merely have faith in it i have observed its efficacy its beauty its truthfulness
i have experienced them viscerally and materially
i'm here to learn and discover i'm here to grow
and wonder with you
thank you for joining me
