Hey everybody. Welcome.
It's funny I have a topic in mind
for today's walk and talk
one that's been brewing for a few days after an unexpected experience in the garden
an experience that was in its way quite pleasant
and yet also quite dangerous
but that topic will await another time
because it's, I'm just not feeling the mood
that goes with a topic so fraught with darkness and peril
and I'm feeling a bit brighter and more buoyant
so you know one of my favorite problems
in terms of our relationship with knowledge
and I've mentioned it before
and I've made videos about it before
could be framed with the words
but no one knows what anything is
now we can't be certain of this
there are prodigies and sages and children
and animals and insects and trees and such and stars and planets and worlds
it's possible that among the seemingly infinite populations of beings
and situations that someone or something
actually might know at least more clearly than we common humans do
what something is or what stuff is
but and you know this is the problem in philosophy of what we might call ontology
the whatness of things, what things are
and then it's sort of partner epistemology
how do we know things
how do we know what we know
so ontology and epistemology seem to be married
in that
the stuff we refer to as justified true belief
is oriented in these two perspectives
and that's a well-known aspect of the philosophy of knowledge
and I just mentioned these words not to be showing off or anything
but just so that people who are listeners can become familiar with them
ontology is sort of the whatness of things
and it can be defined much more carefully
I'm being casual and epistemology is how do we know things
and what qualifies as justified true belief or something similar
knowledge, what qualifies as knowledge
and how does it qualify
yet all of the forms we have are provisional
because we're stuck as human beings in a weird conundrum
a land of tokens and maps, artifacts and representations
and by tokens I mean things like words
we have the word the sun
and I remember as a child asking my father what the sun is
and he began to explain that it was a giant nuclear explosion in space
and then he talked to me about radiation and such
and how it causes cancer and the degeneration of cells
and I became utterly terrified
of course I was only four or something
that the sun was going to kill everything and everything would die of cancer
from the radiation
but of course the sun isn't a nuclear explosion
and even if we say well it's a fusion event
that doesn't help us
because the meaning of words depend on other words
the dictionary and the definitions of words are filled with other words
which themselves have definitions
and in point of fact we don't know the first thing about anything
and by the first thing I mean the most essential thing
so we're in this conundrum of not knowing what anything is
and yet existing and passing through our lives
as though we do know things
and we do know what they are
now there's different kinds of knowledge of course
there is the experiential knowledge that one has
when kissing one's beloved
or you know having a snake wrapping around one's arm
or having a conversation with a spider in one's mind
or tasting food
or feeling the pain of an injury
or being sick
or having a dream
these things we know sort of firsthand
but we don't know what a dream is
we don't know what food is
though again we have elaborate lexicons of tokens
and maps and relationships and constellated models
and explanations
which literally means to flatten things
that plan right
the plan it means flat it's taken from the word plane
B-L-A-N-E
so we have this problem where
we really don't know the first thing about anything
and again though we have experiential knowledge
the kind of knowledge that we seek
that we're sort of after
in the aspects of our minds
that deal with abstractions
and identity and meaning
these things are all placeholders
and what are they placeholders for?
they're placeholders for something more accurate
it seems unlikely
that anything could be infinitely accurate
and thus perfectly true
because perfect truth
would have to have infinite precision
and that would mean regression
into a cascade of recursive
ever closer approaches to perfect exactness and truth
and anything like that
would probably be very dangerous to our minds
because it would have a sort of cognitive gravity
that might resemble that of a black hole
and that doesn't mean
it wouldn't be good or amazing or interesting
but it might be extremely difficult to ever escape it
to have anything to say about the results
of having encountered something like this
or having conceived of something like this
within consciousness
now
consciousness
within which we must imagine knowledge exists
has certain qualities and features
and characteristics
limitations
functions
what we might think of as applications
and these vary widely
but most of them are purposefully limited
because if we were to become so fascinated
with the pursuit of identity
or meaning or the essence of things
that we became insensate
we would die
so that if there were people who were once like that
they probably didn't survive very well
because they just went into a trance
from which they never recovered
and they starved to death and didn't mate
or do any of those things
because they had no interest in those things
the compulsion of the ecstasy
of perfect knowledge
would have exterminated them
at least in the story that I'm telling at the moment
in one version of the story
and yet
we as human beings do have
the deep motivation
to learn
and to discover
what is going on, what things are
presuming of course that there are things
or that something's going on
now
there are of course
philosophical and perhaps religious traditions
that ask us to
consider
whether or not it might be
that there's nothing going on
and that there are no things
the
this is going to be a very ironic discussion
for a moment
the idea of emptiness
in Buddhism
and perhaps particularly in Zen
might be
first of all
is probably considered impossible to communicate
clearly about in ordinary language
though there are mandos between
Zen teachers and students and such
often very puzzling to insiders and outsiders
that play around with the peculiar
notness
of nothingness
what can I say about it this
it seems likely to me that there's something to all of this stuff
likely enough that I've been a student of
Zen traditions for about 30 years
and a fairly committed one
however what I have discovered
wouldn't fit
wouldn't take up a thimble
or even fill the eye of a needle
even a very small needle
and it's somewhat ironic to try to talk about
because
these traditions have something to do with
cutting through the conceptual
mind, the mind of ideas
the mind of language
and by cutting through
I mean something like
both
exiting it
so that
whatever one might be can see from outside of that
or can experience from outside of that
except that seeing and experiencing
aren't really what's happening there, supposedly
and I know a little about that
for I have never truly pierced the veil, so to speak
though I have toyed with the veil in very intimate ways
with the help of some uncommon
companions
so when I'm talking about
when I use the phrase no one knows what anything is
what I mean is
the fundamental questions
remain highly charged
and nearly completely unanswered
what we have standing in the place of answers
for these questions are very provisional constructs
language, concepts, ideas
that are essentially made up
they are make-believe
and they're the kind of make-believe
that comes from the left hemisphere's
desire to name and map
and explain and make models and systems and so on
alright, here's the Cooper's Hawk
now
this is the problem
right here
what is the Cooper's Hawk?
what is the tree?
what is my mind?
what is asking the question?
what is light?
why are we born?
what is time?
what is space?
what is distance?
what does separation mean?
where does it come from?
why is it there?
is it there?
if it's not there, why does it seem to be there?
what are minds?
what is dreaming?
what are organisms?
why are there living worlds?
is the speed of light a speed?
what do the discoveries of physics mean?
where do they come from?
why are there stars?
what is the nature?
what is the essential nature
and meaning character activity of the universe?
now I've fired off a bunch of questions
in a short burst of
cataloging
but what I want to make clear is
we don't have
we don't know the first thing about any of these things
the fact that we have something resembling mechanical measurements of light
tells us nothing about its nature
and
as many people famously asked
what's the speed of darkness?
the one I guess who I remember asking it
or who I first saw ask it was probably Lori Anderson
an astonishingly
hyper intelligent
creative human being
so
I mentioned these questions
not just to boggle our minds with them
but for a number of important reasons
including that each one of them absolutely fascinates me
like most of us
I grew up taking for granted
at least in the beginning
that the adults knew what was going on
because that was the story at play
so I thought of course the adults know what things are
when my father told me his description of the sun
my father at that point
and me being four years old
was essentially a god
so my father knew everything there was to know
and whatever he told me
whether or not I could clearly understand it
I certainly believed to be the truth
the truth
not a truth
and so the only things that we mortals
ordinarily experienced as knowledge
and again I'm not talking about the experiential knowledge
of the scent of this wonderful sage plant
oh my god that scent
it's so
it's just so
compelling
so visceral
I love it
but the knowledge that we think of
when we think of the meanings of our tokens
light, time, birth, death, mind, dream
consciousness, awareness
um
so when I'm speaking of us not knowing about things
I'm talking about this kind of knowledge
abstract knowledge, conceptual knowledge
there is a better description of what light is
than anything humans have ever come up with
and some humans may have come up with it
and it didn't spread it just didn't catch on
and that may be because
well there's all kinds of reasons why that might be so
in some cases
someone fascinated with physics might have discovered
something about light that science
that would destroy science
utterly, right?
that wouldn't catch on
because nobody wants, well
nobody would, let's say the existing cohorts
would not allow the sudden destruction of the entire discipline
by a discovery so earth-shattering
that it would destroy the meaning of every other model that we have
and yet that's precisely the kind of discovery I'm talking about
we are capable as individual human beings
of making discoveries of this kind
we are highly motivated to do so under the right conditions
and
it becomes much more likely impossible
when we form groups
who can serve together
the urgent necessity of pursuing these questions
though lots of dangers ensue from that as well
particularly the dangers of cults, religions
sort of
para-fascistic knowledge systems
things like this
nonetheless what I'm trying to get at is
the knowledge that we have as humans
the knowledge that we can find in books
the knowledge that we are taught in schools
the systematic forms of knowledge
that comprise
the discoveries
and
models and presentations of science
and scientific language
all of these things
compared to the phenomenon
or the phenomena
compared to the phenomena they frame
are so incredibly crude
that even in their apparent
technological advancements
circa 2021
AD
they are
cataclysmically primitive
whatever light actually is
and is doing
if we knew the first thing about it
it would change everything that we know
about all other things
light is a holophor
in order to know about stuff at all
you have to have ideas about light
the world similarly is a holophor
so to the sun
no sun, no world, no world
no minds, no minds, no language
no concepts, no models, no science
no religion and so on
so there are these root concepts
in our lexicons that I call holophores
it's a neologism
I invented
again with the help of
a non-human companion
who
took me to the roots of my lexical intelligence
and showed me around the basement
down there and the structures
that hold up the rest of the constructs
if whatever we might discover
about light or time
would radically transform
everything we know about everything else
and so similarly
if these concepts
over time become damaged
by some activity
and both science and religion
are fully capable of causing this kind of damage
and so too is technology
because over time
ideas that once had
meaning that was so broad
and deep and rich that only the dreaming mind
could possibly
hold it within its cup
because the dreaming mind
in the dreaming mind
meaning and identity
are both partly structured
and yet
in their incompleteness
more robust than what we play with while awake
because their incompletenesses form
suggestions
not declarations
possibilities
and the dreaming mind can sustain many of these possibilities at once
so that our experience of identity and dreaming
presuming that we have experience in dreaming and so on
is so much richer than what we have when we're ordinarily awake
that the only thing we usually have while awake
unless we're in some kind of uncommon ecstatic or visionary state
that resembles it
is psychedelic experience
and psychedelic experience
only resembles it in a very limited kind of way
because the dreaming mind is free
in ways that the most psychedelic experiences
are not
they are structured by
the sort of
enforced continuity
of psychedelia brought on
by the experience of the substance
that's imbibed or whatever
taken
the substance one becomes
one falls under the influence of
that substance enforces
a certain intensity
and constancy of intensity of experience
over the span of such experience
whereas dreaming is much more malleable
and
that's the right word
diverse
in its potential and actual embodiments
and
what I'm trying to get at is that
in dreaming we have experiences
of the meaning of identity
whose dimensionality is far greater
than that we ordinarily will have while awake
there are some exceptions
those exceptions are uncommon
and most of our language about them
is crude or confusing
for example one might speak
of magical experience
and this
word without defining it more
more specifically
is mostly just confusing
what does one mean by this
does one mean ritual magic
or does one mean magical
in the sense of fantastic and otherworldly
and of course I am the one speaking
so I am the one meaning things
but I mean the whole spectrum of possibility
of such experiences
so all of the definition
I'm using the word very generally
I
will never
and unless my mind collapses
or is destroyed somehow
I will never give up the questions
in that list
I need to know them
the way I hunger for food
or adventure
or love
or dreaming
I need to know
what was I
before I was born
was what came together
to become me and why
are their minds, why are their humans
why are humans such
bizarre animals when we compare them
with the rest of the biosphere
what's our problem with technology
that's destroying everything
including our own minds
what is light
what is time, why are there stars
what happens when we die
is there something we need to
accomplish while we're alive
that is imperative
if so what is it and why
are there other intelligences
besides our own, near at hand
or contactable
are they physical intelligences
like ours, are they metaphysical
intelligences that preside over
the sort of some
of the possibilities of time-space
all of these things
I'm starving
to know
and I want
direct experience
of them, I'm not interested
in having answers
you know, presented to me
in books and things
though I'm happy to explore books and things
I need to know first hand
what the answers are
I need to have the experiences
that unlock
insight into the nature of these
questions and the minds
that
entertain them
and I've always been this way
or at least
I've always been so curious
so passionately curious
but even though I couldn't maybe frame
these questions when I was younger
they were pulsing
in
the anatomy of my
consciousness, right, underneath the surface
not yet risen into consciousness
even when I was a child
right, how did, what is language
why do humans have
formal structured
representational thought
I mean, are any other animals
doing something like that
and if so, why
where does it come from, what is it doing
what are the things
and or beings
that our living world
is the repercussive
expression of
in the same way
that the reflections on the surface
of a body of water
are the
repercussive reflections
of light
on the structured
living matter around them
right
what is the world a mirror of
what is reflected in the form
and intelligences here
and what would it be
to experience that directly
rather than indirectly
through these reflections
burn in my heart
and I am in love with them
I can never set them down
even in the moments
of illness or darkness
or despair or
you know, crisis
these questions always
are with me
and I've had some experience of piercing
the veil of human abstract knowledge
and seeing from beyond
it
and the only thing I can say
is that
whatever is out there is so
explosively
ecstatically beautiful
that
were we to be suddenly
exposed to the fury of its beauty
we would be annihilated
and it is layered
right so that
you don't have to just
be exposed to the fury and be annihilated
or live in ignorance
you can kind of climb the ladder of layers
toward annihilation
without being obliterated yet
and gain deeper
and more trustworthy
perspectives and insights
there again is the Cooper's Hawk
though you probably can't
see the bird
and what is that
a reflection of
what is
the metalog
that the Cooper's Hawk
is the analog
in embodied matter of
I want to know, I need to know
and so I have these questions
and I recognize
that what we have mostly as humans
is toys, we have these
very crude placeholders
this is part of what Alfred Korzybski calls
time binding
and that we pass along these tokens
from generation to generation
and the rubric of their
commonly presumptive
meanings and relationships
with each other
and we call this knowledge and yet
to call it imperfect
is the grossest
kind of misbehavior
because
it's
it's like the remnants of a photograph
hit with
with a shotgun blast
and instead of having
seen the photograph
or the subject
of the photograph what we see
are the patterns
in the
remaining material between the holes
right and we take these patterns
for meaningful
knowledge and are thus
deceived
by the very substrate
upon which our intellects
depend
we might say that the beginning
of knowledge is the recognition
that we don't know
the first thing about what anything is
because if we start there
at least we won't begin
by
believing
the blinding
statuary
of
the conceptual and linguistic
and lexical transmissions of our ancestors
we can make use of them
without believing them
but we should begin by disbelieving them
because honestly they tell us
nothing about what light is or what time is
and in fact
we each have the capacity
to see far beyond
anything that we inherit
in part
because
the not yet structured
aspects of our cognitive capacities
exceed
the entire library of
structure we can inherit
from mankind
and there are other intelligences
in the universe
that under the right conditions
will lead us and teach us
some of those conditions are extremely dangerous
and fraught with great peril
others of them are extremely ecstatic
and fraught with great peril
it's hard to say whether any of them are
safe
but
discovery
and safety are not
necessarily consonant
with each other so we may have to take
unusual risks
if we are
compelled
to pierce
the veil
of the conceptual and cognitive
and linguistic knowledge we inherit
and see both
into its origins
and beyond it
toward
some, toward visions
that are more true, more trustworthy
and more accurate without being
perfectly true trustworthy or accurate
and
those visions
are usually
they are
manifolds
they are not singular perspectives
to understand what light is
you need to have seven different perspectives
that are unique and inform each other
that you can play
not just seven of course
I use this number on purpose nonetheless
you need to have a variety of different
perspectives
that
simultaneously inform
the process
of your travel beyond them
to what we might
think of as
the next rung of insight
right or a further rung
of insight
or ring of insight
and thus in one sense
the shape of knowledge
isn't an arrow
it's a sphere made of wheels
within wheels
or something like this
so
this is my inspiration
for today
the great questions
of our existence
and I preserve them
in my heart
and I always will
and I hope that perhaps you may find
this walk and talk inspiring
and resonant
with something deep within yourself
that you too can chase
and pursue
in a kind of
sacred lemniscate
thank you for joining me
I look forward to learning together
again
very soon
