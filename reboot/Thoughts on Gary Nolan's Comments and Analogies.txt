Imagine that when we were still very primitive in terms of our technological
ability but relationally we were advanced in our groups and tribes and war was
probably rare for lots of reasons that another species came and they gave us
single artifact it generates energy it's all it does makes limitless energy and
perhaps at different times there were different versions in different places
some had limits and so certain cultures that got these had limitless
electronic energy and could make things happen with it and then there was some
kind of a disaster and those things were taken away they disappeared but the
memory of them was in our genome in our cell memory we remembered central
machines that were given to us by God's angels etc. and thus instead of chasing
relational intelligence or intelligence itself our species was diverted toward a
fundamental context organized around commodities and technological developments
and thus the only thing that can reasonably drive that it's only two
things war or universal altruism because if it's war it's going to be about
commodities and local ownership competition technological competition
among corporations which aren't human for the sake of a war machine which isn't
human it's an array of processes that run humans so it's either that everyone's
terrified I think oh if we were given a free energy device for example it would
collapse our economies overnight well that's not necessarily true by a long
shot especially if you had unpatentable power sources but
imagine okay here's the fall thought follow that idea that idea subs
depends on the concept of the preservation of the current systems that
are eating our planet and destroying our minds and our cultures and our lives and
our families and our environments like literally just grinding them up and
spitting out bedship and ever-increasing pics machines you know in in the early
days of our relationship with machines it seemed like they came without cost
right it was just free benefit if you have the machine you can do ten things
you couldn't do before and essentially no or very small costs compared to the
investment of energy attention or person power etc so our whole idea is based on
this work equals money equals commodities because it's a fun fundamentally
it's competition so you can see the fiction underneath this is there there
at least three but I'll start with two first the fiction that the only possible
way for humans to exist is in a commodity competition money economic model
context that's the only way if anything happens to that we're dead so that's
the first absolute fiction because if that were true we'd be dead now right if
that were actually true what that would mean is the physical intellectual
developmental and role-based behavior and work of us humans is only effective
in a fictional context where value is represented that's that's the only
dimension in which it's effective and so if you take that I mentioned that
dimension away all of our work behavior becomes useless all of our
developmental behavior our group behavior but the problem is actually the
opposite that monster is captured all of our group developmental and self
sustaining other sustaining healing regeneration renewal behavior all that
behavior has been captured by fictions called work in corporations so if that
shit were to go away and we were in any degree intelligent we would actually
immediately reforge contexts in which our authentic human natures and
intelligences could be developed mentally it's not poised they could be
potentiated developmentally potentiated launched nurtured developed and so forth
every day our efforts could be for each other instead of and for our planet
instead of against each other and our world for the sake of fictions like
governments and corporations and feel like well that sounds communist no
actually it's either communist nor democratic it's simple it's it's
fundamental if we're not being human together and something else is running
our humanity we're dead it's over we will rip our planet and each other apart
right not because that's our nature but because that's what the protocols that
are riding our species are for that's their actual function is to rip us apart
and benefit energetically and developmentally from the resulting agony
energy death it's a vampiric horrifying vampiric array of processes that we call
governments and corporations and churches and so forth not to say that
all churches for example are evil in this way but yeah this stuff is
leafily deadly kills everything you want to talk about virtue signaling there's
no corporations don't have feelings if their car runs you over and they say
they regret it there's nothing there to regret it there's nothing inside a
process to have emotions or ethics or anything so it's literally like creating
a demon and setting it free in human behavioral conceptual communal gardens
and then just having it own all the foundations of each of those domains of
our humanity it doesn't even exist demons in history were probably the
retrocausal projection of corporations and governments in our time being
projected back into time and trying to you know convert and enslave people the
domains of our interiority and collectivity that can be thus colonized
are infinite and so the processes that are eating them are aware that there's
an infinite store of resources across a membrane that barely exists because the
humans don't think about it or act on their awareness of it together so because
we are blind in this one way we can be mostly owns owned in our lives and
actual potentials obliterated just turned into juice attention juice money juice
diamonds juice plutonium juice all these juices those things are death to us
no death they're death dressed up they're the signaling of a virtue that
cannot exist what is the symbol of cash actually mean if you see the stacks of
cash what do you think freedom liberty so why is liberty hidden behind cash and
why is cash hidden behind jobs and why are jobs hidden behind fake collectives
and why are we living in a Potemkin village that is run by forces that aren't
even human yes of course there might be a couple of humans up near the top of
the pyramid of nonsense that have learned but that's not because they
invented the pyramid they just learned that the pyramid can be made something
makes it and then they just traverse the tears of it till they're at the tip of
the cone right these are people like the few AI guys who I won't name here
Bezos Musk Putin Trump they're all just pyramid traversers they know they're not
dealing with humans they're dealing with processes and processes can be easily
manipulated there's no such thing as quote the American people unquote the
American people unquote or whatever you can influence them to become and
nothing less and nothing more they're a potential they don't exist as a being so
you can do anything you want to them in general you're not supposed to quote
unquote do stuff to specific people but you're absolutely free to do anything
you want to the generalization of people or a people witness Russia and Ukraine
witness Israel and Palestine witness damn near every country on earth in
Afghanistan witness China and Tibet witness Spain and the Americas witness
Britain and the Americas probably before that witness I don't know Denmark and
the Americas
fictional collectives stealing human potential origin beauty intelligence
spirit in life joy filial fulfillment development wonder play creativity
exploration discovery insight killing all those things and making graveyards of
predictable little figurated behavior lives that we get plugged into like we
were a fucking appliance that is what's going on and the people who manage
to rise up slightly above the appliance level they just become converted to
creating appliances in the other people and managing dominating owning what a
fucking night we have the potential to be an intelligent species but what we're
being right now is an enslaved species and we're not only in we're not
enslaved by something about our humanity we're enslaved by a vulnerability that
was long ago catalyzed right and became hyper contagious and prevailed over the
entire vastness of the general body of our humanity we didn't know what to do
when our cultures became connected at first it was commerce then it was war
we never had a protocol that could compete to connect us better than the
protocols that compete to divide divide and demean and impoverish us and those
are the protocols we have make no mistake about it in our current situation
machines are eating everything about us what is the cost of the machine in your
life the car all the devices the subscriptions the electricity why is
electricity costing you money why are signals cost why are meaningful signals
costing you money
why does it cost money for you to be human why are you charged to stand still
why is there no place where you belong naturally why why why answer frisps
structured protocols that dominate the generalized layer of humans species
layer the large cohort layer the corporate layer the war layer the
prison layer courtroom layer often the church layer you'll notice that these
are structures of authority in our cultures these are the structures of
authority law enforcement
city council state government federal government intel branch military branch
public relations branch all these things I imagine it's cruel to make such a
terrible analogy but imagine that
imagine the child born into a place where male bullies rule and they display
their prowess and authority by beating children and revoking their their
potentials to develop and because all of the children are born into this we
don't question it it's our natural way of life here in the United States and in
China and in Russia in every developed country around the world this is the and
the only real people outside it you know we could become the people outside it
bear that in mind as I speak the real people outside it are mostly mobsters
and mercenaries some of them are salesmen you can be a salesman without
having to be a mobster or a mercenary though you'll certainly benefit if
you're all three so think about the situation that we're born into and we
take as ordinary if you think the only possible divergence from that is
communism you've been trained to miss think you think you have one finger
instead of you got two fingers instead of ten right well it's either what we're
doing now or it's communism nope nothing to do with that and then there's this
other argument well if we don't tear the earth apart we can't have nice things
completely absurd we can have vastly nicer things by not tearing the earth
apart and simply reducing the the what the hemorrhaging into bank accounts right
into representations of our human developmental relational material and
ecological potentials so actually all the better games are different from the
game we're playing and the people that are wandering around like well we all
got to play one of these games either this game that game those people have
are whiskey-addled simpletons working together for each other isn't
necessarily communism the problem is commodities private ownership is a
fucking problem it gets more expensive every you know five thousandth of a
second to do that and public ownership is also a problem right you have to
create novel solutions to these old issues and in any case I just imagine an
ancient civilization given given a single device that powers everything and
allows them to do otherwise impossible things and it's there for some
generations probably even before there was writing and then at some point it
disappears and we have these weird stories that don't make sense and we
have artifacts that don't make sense vases with circular tolerances within a
few thousandth of a millimeter
develop that we you know be pretty much impossible for us to do without very
complex devices including computers because you can't even have the desire
for that kind of accuracy if you can't measure so how would you measure a few
thousandths of an inch you know four thousand years ago and then I could
imagine us our species becoming like addicted to the absence of that device
that solved all problems and perhaps even prevented war and was nearly never
used to hurt humans or animals until a time until a certain time these are my
thoughts after listening to Gary Nolan he was also talking about a very
important concept which is he mentioned that he had a friend who was in in the
United States intelligence community part of whose mandate was to collect
technological objects from the Soviet Union and bring them back to the US and
for study and they were surprised to discover that not all the principles
are the same principles we use here some of these objects dependent on
principles unfamiliar to us that we had never discovered and some of them were
incomprehensible about at least 30% of them could not be understood what even
what they were how they were so that just goes I mean there's so many implications
of that story the first is you can never be sure if you decide to play enemy
games you can never be sure what your you know what your opponent quote unquote
has but if you decide to play cooperation games imagine how fast you
could develop with no more emphasis on war right the amount of energy and
material and you know then this the the radical reduction in the necessity of
ecological violence to sustain the possibility of wartime violence all
that disappears what's the net energy benefit it's off the charts it's
inconceivable in any actually cooperative situation that isn't poisoned by
corporate competition and so on the humans could advance a thousand years in
a decade right we are retarding our developmental potential in order to
play combat games in the market and on the world level even on the local level
right look at what's happened to our politicians they're like fighting they're
like pit bulls right and their goal isn't to lead the nation their goal is to
manipulate the nation they're not there to determine what the nation wants and
then implement it they are ideological puppeteers that dogfight in a ring where
the primary asset which in a fight would probably be oxygen or the capacity to do
damage per second right DPS Frank DPS rank in oxygen in our politicians are
equivalent to idiot ideological compulsion right how to trigger and grab
the most people that's DPS and oxygen is attention human attention right so
these are like you know battle battle pit bulls ring dogs and the whole thing is
a war-based spectacle that torments our children our grandmothers our mothers
our fathers it torments them and if they celebrate it which some of them do it's
only because there isn't anything as intensely energized and momentous as
that in their daily human experience they're so impoverished that they're
happy to sign on to that instead of having nothing in that dimension so Nolan saying
something very trippy he was like you know there's a rumor that and look he's
not saying there's a rumor we should think it's true he's saying there's a
rumor we should entertain the perspective for what we could learn from it right
and basically he's busy attacking Neil deGrasse Tyson which I think is an
excellent idea and Gary's exactly the right guy to get on that train Neil is
a public idiot on this topic he's embarrassing to listen to he's like a
kind of a gulag sergeant you know a gulag commander who just slaughters anyone
who has an open mind on the topic of non-human intelligence UFOs aliens like
well there's no evident lack of evidence means lack of existence is how to you
know Tyson show me some evidence first I don't think show me evidence well most
of the profound you know developments technologically and mathematically in
human history didn't come from showing the evidence first as Nolan rightly says
but he says that there was a a rumor that we developed fiber optic technology
after retrieving sort of strange tangled crystal-y wires from Roswell hard to
know what he means like maybe we discovered there were channels inside
hull material or something that were crystallized in a certain way or maybe
there were actual wiring like things but he said just because we develop that
technology have that doesn't mean we know what they use it for so you know we
develop fiber optic technology to move information approaching the speed of
light and so on and he was saying we have just because we you know we derived
the technological use for something that we were made to imagine by having seen
these objects doesn't mean we know what they were used for they might have been
used for 12 different things at once we tend to use things for one thing we use
technologies for singular purposes the computer is one of the first devices
that's a meta-purpose device but what if there's a meta-purpose device for
physics and now you can build devices that don't just accelerate or do this
they satisfy nine desires or 15 he didn't say this this is my addition so he
was like suppose that this is a great analogy that really deserves propagation
I'm sure he's using it elsewhere thankfully but suppose that we could
transfer a smartphone back to cave dwellers who are using stone and wood
tools now that doesn't mean those people aren't intelligent in fact they're
probably vastly more intelligent than it is possible for us to be because whatever
their intelligences may be they're not invested in machines so they have the
freedom to invest that in attention and that's probably the origin of what we
think of as magic is simply the investment of unliked uncompromised human
attention in a situation say an injury or an illness and the ability to direct
uncompromised attention is equivalent with magic prophecy healing transcendence
superhuman abilities and so forth this is the actual key is just this one thing
uncompromised attention focus if you will and people say well why can focus on
anything it doesn't mean it happens yeah right but I'm talking about nine
kinds of focus you've never tasted partially because you're busy thinking
of objections instead of doing something with the awareness and
intelligence and consciousness that are your
originary endowments we are trained to be distracted in 15 ways we can't see if
those disappeared suddenly your mind would be capable of things you suspect
to be impossible your awareness your consciousness you could direct it instead
of be subject to its unsteady and largely incoherent spasms and we do this we
cohere intelligence we do it for the sake of corporations we do it for the sake
of art we do it for the sake of sports that's why people get so excited when
they see success is because they realize at least subconsciously this is what
coordinated focused attention achieves so when you join a company they teach you
how to pay the kind of focused attention they are paying you for and often they
will strictly delimit what they want you to pay attention to pay attention to
these three things not unuseful but we could do better together even in a
small group of five people for any purpose under the sun why don't we
arbitrarily compose those together why are we trapped in the idea of an
individuality that is as agonizing as it is prison like why why why what's
going on so Gary says if we transmitted a cell phone back to cave dwellers they
might there's almost no chance they'd figure out what it does or it was was
for they'd have no way to because the context in which it functions doesn't
exist there they'd have no way to discover that context from playing around
with the phone till the battery died or you know you could presume that we give
them a solar charger so that they'd have the chance to recharge the thing if they
didn't bust it apart what they might discover was glass they might figure out
how to heat sand or something how to heat rock dust and make something like
glass or maybe before that ceramic objects clay objects and things that
they wouldn't discover what's you know cell phones do not likely so they might
derive a discovery from it and he's saying we are the same as regards non-human
quote technologies on quote first of all we're expecting that it's a material
technology or an energetic technology because those are the only two kinds we
know and we're awaiting the unification similar to that of time space that
Einstein gave us or unforgot to us because he really I'm not sure he just
decided that something we were conceiving as separate must be conceived of
other than that and so maybe we were awaiting a similar reunification of
matter and energy matter and energy are the same thing they have to be thought
of as the same thing and so the domain of quantum physics is a material domain
right and the domain of matter is a quantum physical domain even though
there is a layered distinction between the macro and the micro that we observe
it's just a matter of scale and aggregation right it's an aggregation
game you get enough quanta doing something similar and the state begins to
collapse what causes quanta to do something similar all kinds of things
Sheldrake's not wrong, Bohm is kind of wrong, Penrose much less wrong, it's gravity
he's probably right, what's gravity it's historical attention historical
structure potential for matching in historical structure would say Sheldrake
who's not a physicist in any case so it's similar if they gave us like a
multi-object we'd probably focus on doing one thing with it a long long time
ago who knows what exactly that one thing was it appears to be things like
making pyramids and cutting stone but it's not entirely clear what else was
done because something astonishing it seems nearly certain was being done with
pyramids those things are not merely monuments sorry just not not you know
they might have been what would be hilarious to be a science fiction story
where the aliens gave the ancient humans a technology to keep the earth from
getting smashed into by near-earth objects maybe the earth had somewhat
incompletely cleared her field of such objects and so they were the protectors
right they could divert those objects with some form of electromagnetic and
or non-ordinary tech and then something happened and they broke down and
boom and then no more you know multi-objects now here's the thing about
that glass analogy right we probably can't necessarily receive you know the
technological progeny of the smartphone from the human future and then derive
some new tech from it even though we couldn't understand what it does the
way the humans in Gary Nolan's analogy do but what we can do and this is what
part of what Nolan's recommending is take ideas from the future and bring them
back here and play with them and see what they do
perspectively and in terms of alerting us to the possibility of a direction of
developmental excellence or seemingly impossible progress and this is what life
naturally does this is what we should be doing not for the sake of building
machines or war and world-wrecking and shit not for the sake of ideologies that
enslave not just the humans but all of life on earth it doesn't matter whether
there's actual evil or not because what the humans are doing at the group scale
is evil and it has long been evil and I would argue that there's not it doesn't
require there to be any actual thing making the evil it can just be made of
human defection from intelligence and mutual concern anything that takes
advantage of that should be obliterated at the very least it must be starved of
attention until it disappears so that we can regain the developmental and
transcendent momentum storehouse in that thing like a bad bank vault in
Switzerland and it's time to uncreate the pyramids that mafia warlords rise to
the top of in our societies no more presidents this is a stupid game it's
not serving any purpose like whatever the original intention was we have to
stop it now and just do a different thing like right now the history and
future of our people depend on these things we can't lay around you know
spouting our opinions and shit we have to do something about this our
grandmothers are crying our grandfathers are crying children in the future will
die if we get to have them our people will be tortured continuously in an
evermore technological array of layered prison-eering protocols and colonization
protocols the same thing that ate our minds as children will eat our planet
as adults we must do something other than this together now within for each
other we have to at least run the experiments together now this isn't a
recruitment call in that you know I'm saying hey call me up let's do something
about this but it is kind of a recruitment call in that I am saying
form a small group pick five you know pick four or five people go for odd
numbers form a small group and think about these matters together plan little
missions to solve problems learn how to cooperate learn how to integrate learn
how to use your intelligence for each other in a situation rather than for
what it's being directed to by culture or the avoidance of culture or the
rebellious mimicry of certain cultural branches that is most often art sarcasm
isn't worth our time except as a spice cynicism isn't worth our time except as
a spice for humor and play and overcoming you know these are my thoughts and my
passionate feelings something has been horribly wrong here forever we sensed
it since childhood most of us made vows to oppose it sometime long ago when we
first discovered that what the adults were doing was neither trustworthy nor
intelligent and that they were playing some kind of bizarre game often
involving really strange uses of language identity and concept that
couldn't be true because they were so narrow
so it is a recruitment call to do something figure learn the protocols
that learn the qualities of the protocols that have enslaved us and if
you want I will show you them right I'm carrying a little book of the stuff we
need to learn and teach each other about language and culture and so forth to get
the fuck outside of it learn learn the history of representational cognition
learn general semantics learn math learn Zen learn Tai Chi you know learn
actually learn what stimulates your souls and amnesis right
unforgettable and learn those whatever those things may be and integrate them
and use them to solve the problem and build a little team that does this as a
hobby practice on little problems Joe can't fix his fence you know what for
whatever reason the grocery store is using a floor cleaner that's getting
into all the food near the floor and poisoning the people there all the food
in the United States is filled with glycophates from Roundup just go after a
problem solve it experiment adventure this is what we are born for not for
this weird thing we're doing that doesn't make any sense and it miserates
most of us and you know it's not only miserable one can learn to prosper in
the con the construct environment the representational layers of human culture
and so forth in a way that you know slightly fulfilling if if one's
development is constantly be you know having the potential to be upgraded
within the construct right it's when you get trapped at a level that it starts to
be miserable because routine is both comforting and terrifying routine has the
capacity to deaden our developmental eros and inaction potentials I have so
many more thoughts but yeah put a small team together experiment try right and
if it fit and be ready to fail right this isn't a process where you put it
together and it succeeds you put it together and you fail and you re-put it
together and you try again and you you know you you learn just like you're
learning how to walk or pilot a boat or speak you learn by trying you fall down
you fall down don't worry if it falls down just put it back together and try
again it will fall down but it'll also succeed and when you get a taste of that
success you're gonna naturally want a little more because it's very very sweet
to succeed at something for each other for the planet for the history and
future of life that's what we're here for that's what we're born for you like
what's the meaning of life that's the meaning of life every child knows it when
they're born to get sort of talked out of it cultures very distracting very
cognitively and relationally in structuring very undreamy and the
dreams it offers come prepackaged from the prisoners the warlords and
profiteers
a little girl was saying sometimes when I'm walking I find an animal that might
be in danger and I take it home with me and put it on a safe plant or it'll be
safe like sometimes I might find a caterpillar and I pick it up no way I
don't pick it up I put it on a leaf and I take it with me on the leaf till I
find a plant and then once I saw that a bird was looking at the caterpillar on a
leaf so I moved to the caterpillar to where the bird couldn't see it that's
what that four-year-old girl that's what was on her mind when she was walking
with her friend that's what I'm talking about that's an authentic example of
what it means to be a human being that I don't care what your objections are I
really don't go ahead and have them if you do I don't care you know we can
talk about them I'll absolutely talk about them with you once or twice not
forever but yeah that's what that's what being alive is actually about doesn't
mean we don't eat things it does mean we don't burn them down to make machines
and prisons and war and then burn them down again when we have wars and we
don't wholesale obliterate whole genomes and life histories for the sake of some
company that produces roundup
we don't propagate lethal toxic weapons in our environment ever ever you know
there's certain commandments that if you don't keep them the other ones won't
matter and that's what the processes that have enslaved and
structured the group-scale behavior of our people that's their primary result
right those things they prosper by hitchhiking on deaths the energy that
that is released at death right they're like a snuff film for organisms and it
doesn't matter whether that's because there's demons or whether we accidentally
invented demons that's not human it's not us it's not our nature to be that way
but what we've heard that is a lie we've heard it from the forces that intend to
continue to produce those results and situations for profit and power and
dominance that's where we hear that no it's not just human nature nothing to do
with human nature that's what colonize that's what
multiply pre-colonized humans do and that's how they appear in their
orientations motivations behavior and results
people are like you know chimpanzees are really combative okay great we're not
chimpanzees sharks are really predatory
lots of other fish aren't
some of the biggest fishes eat little tiny stuff that lives it's like a cloud
of tiny organisms and these feed the whales nature is not as red in tooth
and claw as the colonizers and Christians would have you imagine
we can discover a better way we can become a better way and even if we do it
for five minutes a day that matters even if the little cohort we build lasts
45 minutes and fails that matters we can remember how to be here how to form
minds with each other we can receive ideas from the future but give us the
concept of a potential direction of our relational intellectual spiritual
motivational development we can always do that for free anytime we want we're
much more free than it seems much more free but we have to make the choice to
do to enact those potentials so we have to defect from the structures that
trap us and meaningfully defect into mutually altruistic groups adventure
zones and one of the best ways we can do that is really by playing certain
kinds of games but differ from the games that are not actually gamey that are
not fully game like in the extended body generalized collectives of our kind
of animal here on earth there's probably there's obviously something much better
that collectivity and the natural collectivity of humans is for them what
has been being done with it let's find out all those things together today and
in the future
