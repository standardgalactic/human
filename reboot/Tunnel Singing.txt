So I am here near the museum. I am at the, this is really bizarre, so disorienting.
So that sound you hear is not the sound of living things, that's the sound of machines.
And it's a sound I've despised. I can't stand when there are machines making the sounds of organisms.
It's so disruptive that I can't actually remember the name of this place.
But I'm at the Life Sciences Museum, I'm outside of it. The sound has never been here before.
And I came because I wanted to sing a little bit in this tunnel.
But right now, the sound of those machines is so loud that the beautiful sounds in the tunnel are a little bit difficult to hear.
Nonetheless, I'll have a go at singing a little bit here in the tunnel.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
Thank you for watching.
