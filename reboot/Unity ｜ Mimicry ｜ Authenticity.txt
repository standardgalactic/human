in the water this name i probably used to know
they are circling in a great migration in this little part of the pool
they are dancing
they are traveling
and there's something like a turbulent spiral everybody
even though it's very very slow
and this pond is
is often harassed by machine noises no this this pond is a
it's fed from an underground aquifer but it's a it's a mechanically you know sustained
pond right you can see the the pipe
and of course everything here in the gardens is artificial in the sense that humans decided
here we will make a park it was all sand dunes
and and so they made a park here but one can't see it i can't anyway see it in the same way
as i might see you know like a fork or a book or a machine
it's not artificial in that sense because uh there's there's a living collaboration going on
excuse me even if the humans are not particularly sensitive collaborators
yeah this is a a mash-up of human ideas and anciently evolved life forms
that ordinarily don't find themselves in in such diverse proximity to one another
around this little pond is bamboo
and in the wind the bamboo makes a very
unique it has a library of music sit makes
that's it's quite profound
but i was walking past the pond
and um i dropped something a couple coins fell out of my purse
as i was looking around and so i thought i'd wander over
i thought i would interpret the coins dropping from my purse
as a signal to pay attention right here right there's in other words like there's value here
right the the metification of the playful metification right not like a religion
more like an adventure and so my the coins fell out of my purse and as i reached down to pick
them up i thought huh maybe i won't just walk on maybe i'll start paying attention right here
and then i saw the uh the migrating water plan situation
not to mention the wonderful reflection in the water the reflections in the water they are
enchanting i mean one might call them enchantments in the water
but whether or not they seem inviting and open
and
whether or not they inspire us with wonder or awe or even
fear of their astonishing depth and potentials
and i mean that in sense of you know in our relation with them
emotionally, imaginably, cognitively and with our hearts right with our essence
the reflections are truly profound but only for those who can
find the path beyond
the tragically
vacuous
nature of our our adulthood that sees things in terms of functions and oh i already know about that
i was thinking the other day and this is not an uncommon thought for me
but i think a glimpse of the actual nature of any tree
any old tree or you know an ant
or anything that any of the living beings right
a glimpse if the tree could actually reveal to us
which they can providing we're properly receptive
something of the nature of its
way of being its essence
what it carries within
in terms of
knowledge and histories and
unexpected opportunities for animals and human beings
if we could see for just a moment the tiniest glimpse of what a living being actually is
or without like i said not without we don't even see all of it and it doesn't have to be perfectly
correct it just needs to to have the proper dimensionality right the depth the living depth
that's actually there it would obliterate religion all of our religions would look
a bit clumsy to be kind and you know science would pass out in shock i think
or scientists would since science isn't really a being and can't can't pass out
no all of our stories would be rocked to their core in fact we'd have to revise our knowledge of
everything from the ground up if we could get a tiny glimpse an authentic glimpse into the being
of any of the living beings that we so easily dismiss with words
it's
i remember saying i used to know the name of the little plant
and i'm pretty sure i did but be assured that never helped me much
because that name doesn't contain any knowledge
i was listening to something i've long been aware of
well i think by the way i think the same thing would happen if a stone could
you know communicate to us and perhaps all of this doesn't seem to make a lot of sense on the surface
or like i have some it might seem like i have some strange religion or you know something like this
here is what i am quite sure is a coyote burrow and it's probably a little bit dangerous to
approach it but i don't know because i have so little experience with animal burrows but let's have a look
nonetheless
i discovered this a couple of weeks ago and
it's only been about two and a half weeks
since i saw my first animal burrow and i was very cautious because i don't know what to expect i
don't know if it's reasonably safe to approach or not
if the animal might suddenly come out and i don't actually know what animal is in there
and i was just confused because i've been in the gardens for many years and i've never seen
a burrow like this though i'm sure the workers here probably have
and this is a trail where i commonly come across coyote scap
and i expect that it's a coyote burrow but in the back of my mind i secretly wonder if it might be
something even more more feral and i think of badgers as more feral i'm curious is it possible
there could be badgers here i've heard one person very emphatically declare that they saw a badger in here but
i've never seen any evidence of such a situation and i think there'd be some
so it might sound like like i have some kind of strange religion
and i don't mind really if people misinterpret me but i'd rather communicate clearly enough
that some of my intended meaning arises in the imagination of those who listen
people like you and thank you for listening
though i'm all surgically prepared here for my my adventure in the garden today
and it's off to a good start with the
the little vortex in the pond
just as i was saying everything here is man made in the sense of humans planned and built and
established and brought in all these plants and tend them and edit them and regularize them
and on the one hand it's absolutely gorgeous and wonderful
but there's a kind of there are many tragic aspects to it the plants are deprived of their
natural symbionts if they're not from around here and some of them are so peculiarly developed
that they live in very close symbiosis with one or two or 12 other large organisms and possibly
hundreds of maybe thousands of microorganisms kinds of microorganisms so
you know
humans in their zoos
i understand the idea the implementation
and there's much to be desired well with zoos it's a nightmare
but i don't really have a religion about it what i have
are very surprising experiences
in which usually unexpectedly
nature reaches out
this is the place where a tragedy took place
this is one of this is one of the darker moments of adventure
came here one day making a video set my phone down here
just this blue barrel
i saw a beautiful raptor feather back here
and then as i looked into the barrel which had about this much water in it
there was a drowned raptor inside the barrel
and i've taken that video down
for reasons i can't entirely explain
but i've had experiences where suddenly and unexpectedly
doorways into the intelligences of nature and the relations of living places and beings
have suddenly opened up and invited me in to remember
to recognize to see from non-human perspectives and some of them
far exceed our wildest dreams
they're they're so profound and exotic it is not possible to imagine them
but to be drawn directly into the experience
and you know this happens actually there isn't anything else that's happening
it's just that the scale and scope and discontinuity
is most often for us very low right very small
we may appreciate the beauty
of this detour
i wonder why it has so few leaves
i wonder if it's seasonal
these plants fill the air with astonishing fragrances in the night
so i've had experiences where suddenly unexpectedly
i've
traveled through
it's very difficult to think of how to talk about this meaning clearly
something in the foundation of my mind
and perhaps my body and maybe something else that i don't have the right word for
but it could be my soul shifts and often this shift is unexpected
even though i could be seeking it i keep going along thinking i'd like to have an adventure
in nature's doorways today sort of like i am now in my waking mind you know my ordinary
like i think this would be really fun and i would like to learn some more and see again
and remember again
and that intention is very helpful
in some way
but luck and opportunity and so many other things are involved
so many other qualities are involved
but it's not that i have a strange religion
it's that i have experiences
in and with living creatures in nature
but there is no corollary of in my ordinary human
life knowledge expectation thought perception they are outside completely
they even make experiences of significant intoxication or psychedelia up here
relatively timid in comparison and also kind of fake in a specific way that's difficult to
encapsulate in language there's a kind of
it's as if there is in fact
so hard not to use value laden words
there is something holy in the sense of
more than merely unified right it's a one that keeps finding new ways to be more than merely
a unity in other words you can imagine this right you can imagine very simply
um a set of points we'll think of them as beings and we'll connect five of them right
and then we'll draw we'll give them each new colors of connection right now we get a new
dimension of unity and then we connect some in more intimate loops of union and others in
what could we say uh oh we'll just put a little mark next to the other groups right so you can see
that something that's fundamentally unified can can continue to develop new dimensions of unity
right which i often think of as new degrees of freedom because in essence there are new
dimensions in which we can um sense interact and we mimic this process with our machines
which is really weird except that i it's very clear to me why we get why we why we do the
mimicry instead of the well what i mean is once the mimicry begins and people become fascinated with it
what it's mimicking disappears from our our sense our access
because we become trained by the resulting commodities and representations and transactions
and so on and so forth and these are really very tedious and sort of dimensionally dead
they're dead inside there's no there there there's no real content
and much of it is mediated by machines and money
there isn't anything the humans have learned that wasn't derived from nature
so if you want to go to the original place it's all waiting
and some of the living world is deeply excited not not everywhere not all the time
but some of the world is deeply excited and is seeking an opportunity so to speak
to bridge the old gulf between the humans and the sky between the humans
and the origins of life and being between the humans and the living places between the humans
and the animals between the humans and the plants because the humans are very powerful
not to mention
unexpectedly confusable
and so very dangerous and so the living places and the living beings
um
well i wonder if i'm anthropomorphizing here
well i think
i think
there's a natural reticence
that that could be felt by the living places and the living beings
um
because our class of animal
is unpredictable disoriented ravenous cruel ignorant blind and very very powerful so that looks just about like a demon really it looks like just something that's totally disoriented and ripping things apart with an endless hunger to produce things that actually don't matter much
um so there's a natural trepidation
um in in relation to our class of animal and see here's the real problem
when in thought or cognition properties of the that we've associated with individual experiences or specific experiences of some group we distinguish
when we decide to transfer those properties to the entire class
of people so that we then say for example
man of x kind right are all
why because some men of x kind have been known to be why
why so this is the fallacy of exchanging the
qualities of instances of extending them over the whole class and the humans do this all the time
um you can see this going on all over the news
in social media um our modern situation might even be said to have weaponized this possibility
so because the humans are sort of generally mean and untrustworthy and most of the encounters
that living creatures and living places have with humans do not go well for them
if there's any kind of extended contact and part of the reason is that the humans are just not really in the relationship at all
in a way they're kind of like a disembodied animal they're really from from nature's perspective we'd be really terrifying
i think we'd be at least as terrifying as the idea of
like of aliens who are totally estranged from our humanity would be to us
so the situation is a little bit peculiar however thankfully nature isn't very thinky
it has this other way of being intelligent that's nothing like words
um and much deeper and much richer and more trustworthy and it has humor but it doesn't disemble
um i've never i i recall no experience i can get things wrong but
i recall no experience of the living world speaking with me in which i wasn't aware
of encountering a species of truth so deep so absolutely trustworthy as if my bones and the mind
i beheld it with were made of it right it was it wasn't mere recognition of truth it was a kind of self recognition
of oh yeah this is what the essence of minds and intelligence and consciousness and being
oh yes now i remember it's like this experience that i you know often well occasionally is a better word
have with living beings or places the lake the ocean the night sky the garden a tree some animal some insects
and again the language is very tricky and value laden people will suppose i'm talking
about you know spirituality that this is the topic that i'm on it's not
that's one of the few branches that's one of the few ways of knowing
yes filled with counterfeit nonsense but not itself essentially nonsensical
that's one of the only ways of knowing that we have any input from that resembles what i'm
you know reflecting upon
but there was a time before which there was a time before which
things were thus distinguished right there was a time before which
there was any idea of spirituality and whatever we might use that word to refer to was either
not going on because it's sort of a modern thing or it was so embodied and embedded
that it was indistinguishable from just being
right the same way one's emotions are kind of indistinguishable from just being one's
uh relationally extended sensorium was just indistinguishable from being
i suspect our ancestors regularly felt the
they were engaged in living conversations with animals and plants and living places
and song was involved in these conversations
song was regularly involved and also song resulted from these conversations
it was a product because the ecstasy of such a conversation
the the relief at finally being welcomed back into a circle
of deeply authentic
purpose shared mutual purpose deeply authentic intelligence knowledge of a kind
that supersedes both thought and dreaming
that refreshing reassurance
and you know it's a shared thing it goes both ways it's as if
somehow i'm the long lost family member of this pond and this pond
is the is is like the physical
cool
the pond is a living secret that recognizes me
and is recognized when we when our essences come together in conversation
and so we both transform in a way that's ancient and familiar and
unique to every experience yet not dissimilar along the continuum of experiences
i wonder if the frogs are still here
i don't hear their plops
i was thinking of many things today i was thinking of um
um
some of the sort of Taoist ideas
embodied in martial arts particularly perhaps tai chi qi geng sheng yi ba gua
pushing hands twi shao
i was thinking about this uh place before the
the yin and the yang have divided before they divide
and become active stillness
i think there are endless varieties of stillness and
often i accidentally stumble into a kind of inner stillness before
just before a doorway in nature opens up
the stillness and the invitation
they seem related

than all than the entire collection of human conjectures.
And we're made of it. It's not right next door. We're made of it.
We're made of this astonishing accessible wonderment.
And our original home remembers us, our home before bodies, before identities.
It remembers us. And the world is all made of this, but there's a kind of reflective shell on the top.
And it's composed of habits and thinking and names and concepts and science.
And that shell is very peculiar.
But the mind is layered. I was thinking about this too.
And the layers are almost like they can be thought of usefully as similar to the geologic strata.
That paleontologists and geologists and similar folks or archaeologists study the strata of time.
And so our minds are like this, and the superficial shell-like structure is super new
and there's no room to move around in there in the sense that there would be
if you could go down just one layer to a little bit older strata.
But there's stuff in our minds, in the sort of nature of this layered manifold.
There's stuff in there for purposes.
We've written stories about, but very rarely embodied in the modern world.
There's a reason why we have myths and religions.
And it's not because some people a long time ago like to make up really fantastical things and scare each other with them.
No, that's not why we have them.
There's all of the aspects of heroism, altruism, tragedy, hubris, drama, nemesis.
All of these things, they are the rather, well, in their time they were different.
That's the problem.
The minds we read them now can't see the richness they encode, unfortunately, for most of us.
Though we can learn to, and I think that's a wonderful thing to do, to try to understand the minds of the ancients.
And also the developmental course, the sort of course in the milestones and the adventures we can discover in the evolution of human consciousness.
So I was thinking about the layered mind and how if we could get the tiniest glimpse of the essence of any living being, its real nature, or its more truthful nature,
if we could just slightly more closely approach what's actually going on with consciousness in a way where we become participants again in a conversation,
then the sky's not the limit.
There is no limit, in fact, yeah.
Because there's so much depth there that our modern minds cannot admit.
And if they can admit some of it, they're very inclined by knowledge and context and especially if we are single language users and so on.
They're very inclined to flatten the whole idea of identity.
A tree is just a law of blossom tree, a laurel, or an oak, a name.
And that's pretty much the end of their interest in the situation, unless it can be converted into a lumber.
It's particularly beautiful and they like to preserve it or something like that.
They have some utilitarian idea.
Of course there are many people who have discovered that there are doorways in nature to varying depths.
But most of them have stayed within the human knowledge framework, the modern human knowledge frameworks.
And those are incapable of admitting the incredible...
I don't know what other word to use. There's like this profusion of dimensional existence and intelligence and awareness.
But I mean that's just the beginning.
If we could glimpse the essence of a sparrow, or any one thing at all.
I mean this is the weird thing that humans don't know the first thing about anything.
We have theories about mechanical relationships between distinguishable elements.
Suppose you had that about me. What would that do for you?
What would you know of me?
Not much.
And certainly this is both necessary and insufficient in terms of a relationship with nature.
It seems necessary. We want to know the mechanics.
But why do we want to know the mechanics?
And what will we do with them?
These are incredibly important questions.
Our worldview has this shell that reflects incoming novelty away from us.
Reflects incoming signals and communication. It just doesn't penetrate.
It doesn't penetrate our worldview, our world concept.
In which trees are just plants.
Funguses are just funguses, viruses are just viruses.
We have no... The relationship is totally abstract.
That's not a relationship. That's the problem.
It's not that it's unuseful to have abstract knowledge.
It's that it presents dangers of defection from embodied knowing and deep communion.
If there's no reason for reverence other than the complexity of the structures derived from analysis,
I think we're lost.
This in no way invalidates the beauty that we can feel or sense in mathematics or physics or biology,
which are very clinical toward objective knowledge, knowing paths.
And I don't want to throw them away.
But, or yet, they have our familiarity with them has transferred the places where they're incredibly shallow to the supercontainer, to the everything.
So that our worldview has been denuded by the way we authorize or over-authorize not science or scientific thought,
but what we make of it in terms of its entailments.
So if we universalize the entailments of a relatively young system of knowledge,
we've made some very dangerous and deceptive mistake because once we do that, we've changed the thing we see with.
See the problem there? You're really going to have a hard time fixing that.
If you change the thing you see with in a way that deprives you of liberties, kinds of liberty,
you're going to have a really hard time even noticing that happened because you can't see changes to the thing you see with with the thing you see with.
Maybe that should be a tongue twister.
And this is part of what's, you know, what's gone on with our species as we became modern.
We kept changing the thing we compose our worldview with and of in such a way that it became analytically sophisticated and relationally crippled.
And if you can only have one of these, you probably want relationships.
Because the analysis isn't going to be much good without oxygen or, you know, trees, whales, mice, hummingbirds, children, sage, time, oregano, lavender, rosemary.
Names in English are kind of broken. It would be better if names told us something profound about what they refer to.
I was thinking about that too as often crosses my mind.
I don't reject outright the Latinate, you know, the Latin biological taxonomies.
Those are useful where they're useful, but our names should say something about our relationships with the beings and the nature of the beings that we tag them with.
I would like that. I would like to speak a language that was like that. I would like to know a language that is like that.
And in nature, when I have an experience, that's not good.

more like bringing outer space home, drawing it down from the sky into us, which I think is, you know, maybe one of the peculiar specializations of our species that's been forgotten, though you see it spirit in science fiction and things like this.
We've lost wonder, our, the scientific, not scientific, but the scientific, projections on identity and meaning and truth have been very strange.
We've inclined us to blindness of many different kinds.
And this isn't because the science isn't good, it's because we transfer what we learned from the science to other things, right, world views and ideas and bases for evaluation.
The other thing I was thinking about earlier, since I think I'm going to wrap up here pretty quick, I was just thinking about the profoundly amazing idea, and I'm, though I'm not
I'm certainly not entitled to speak about anything.
How can I say this? It's very strange, and the only reason I'm even saying this is because modernity has gone loopy.
But I'm not really entitled to speak with knowledge about the ways of life of blackfoot people.
But I have learned some things from blackfoot people, and
and their teepees are really quite a profound thing because
There are little instances of the universe, right?
So, their opening points, I think usually in a specific direction, and if I get any of this wrong, I'm happy to be corrected.
It's not the important point that I get every piece right, or even that I deeply know what I'm talking about. I don't.
I'm just fascinated. I'm not entitled to speak knowingly about these things. I'm just curious and filled with wonder.
So, that it seems to me might be excusable, in case somebody wanted to form an accusation.
In any case, their homes that they lived in, or they lived in, when they lived in teepees, were really a profoundly unusual thing.
They were like, see, here's the problem, they weren't exactly things.
I think if we were able to think meaningfully about the teepees, if one was able to, if I was able to, if you were able to, if we could do it together,
we'd have an initial problem in that there wouldn't be a correct category to place them in.
They are not just things. They are not precisely beings.
They have qualities that necessarily...
That are necessarily intrinsic to them, that cause the categories that we would ordinarily distinguish, I think, to kind of collapse.
And again, I'm happy if someone disagrees with me. Maybe this is more my perspective than a Blackfoot perspective.
But from what I understood and took in my own way, I will admit, and take responsibility for, this is a problem for regular Western minds.
There are properties and qualities and functions of teepees before the colonists came, at least maybe for some time after, and still today.
That cause them to not fit in any ordinary category, because they have some qualities associated with beings, yet they are not beings.
They have qualities associated with things, yet they are not things.
They have qualities associated with the universe, yet they are not the universe, precisely.
But what they can be thought of is little, unique instances...
On the outside, there are sky beings.
The sun may appear, the moon may appear, the morning star may be indicated, the...
I call it the companion star, but the false morning star may be indicated.
Around the base, there are often, it's often like a band of dark with some white circles that go around the base, though this is not the only way.
Those have a very special significance.
The structure of the teepee itself is quite profound, because it's scalar, right?
First of all, it's one thing, but it has components.
It's scalar, it goes from a sort of a point to a base, and on the outside, there could be animals, too, on the outside.
But usually, there are routes inside the animals that are significant and depicted.
It might be a bear, there might be a deer, there might be another animal.
And the significances of these things are not western.
They have extra dimensions of meaning that we don't do.
But in the collection of teepees, each one is similar, but each one is unique.
And on the outside, there is sort of the sky and the world of origin, and on the inside, there is the home and the heart and the fire.
And it's one place, so there's no privacy inside, inside there.
It's almost like each little family is a bit like mankind's relationship to the sky, inside the teepee.
There's all different ways of thinking about it, useful ones.
But my point is just that if you live inside a living world model, which like these teepees, which might seem to us to be ridiculous,
they might seem to us to be primitive or not sufficiently advanced or protective for the elements or so on and so forth.
It's so profound to think of the difference in the ways of life of a people who live inside a teepee
that depict their relationships, that recall and remind them and embody their relationships with their ancestors and the sky and the origins of life and death and the living places, the living beings.
Their homes embody these relationships, and it's not merely symbolic.
This is the really cool thing.
Though symbols, though we would call those symbols, I don't think they would, because they're not really symbols, they're function.
Well, it's actually even like, yeah, the whole language doesn't work. They're not there to function.
That's not why they make, you know, I mean, yes, of course they make teepees to function, but I mean the symbols and the sun being there, for instance, and so on.
So it's really profound that they lived within these embodied reflections.
Of the universe as they understood and experienced it together.
And how different that is from living in a box, even though, in a sense, we're doing the same thing.
We're living in a model of the universe.
We've just forgotten that this is so, and architects all know this, and have all kinds of interesting ways of playing with that.
But ours is extremely structured, representational, which is less than symbolic.
We've sacrificed more depth and richness than mere symbols might.
Though, of course, I'm speaking very generally. There are unique examples of different things all over the place.
I'm looking at what concerns me.
So these are some of the things I've been rolling over in my mind today.
I appreciate all of you very much and hope that our travels together while I get my exercise and visit the garden,
are somehow refreshing, nourishing, and thought-provoking.
I thought, I don't really like the word provoke. I don't want to provoke thoughts.
Are those pears? Or are they figs? Oh, I've got to figure this out.
They look like figs, actually.
Thank you for joining me. Hope to see you again soon.
Goodbye for now.
