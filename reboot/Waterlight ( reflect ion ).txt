When the water is undisturbed by the boat's emissions, these reflections of light become
profoundly coherent, and these reflections as they appear on stable surfaces are the sign
of the activity and the localization of the union of light, time, space, being, awareness,
origin, and apocalypse. These are living magic, accessible directly to human participation,
awareness, and understanding. And as I speak of this, they are transforming in response to being
recognized, which further draws me into the direct participation in the phenomena. This is nature's
eye, this is nature's fingertip, this is nature's dreaming, and this is a transport system, a system
of transports in what I call the my arc. These reflections, their patterns are like music. They
are alive, they are profound, they are holy, they are
in a cave, they are in a tunnel.
