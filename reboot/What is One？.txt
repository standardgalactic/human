Hello, everybody. Thanks for joining me. I have a couple avian friends here with me
in the garden. And my friends are vulnerable to hawks. I noticed there were some near and
they're usually really good about noticing them. But the scope of their concern is not
the same as the scope of mine. The way they're in the world I think is wildly different from
the way that I am while at the same time sharing features that are similar. I think there's
a sense of being embodied and being in time is very different from mine. Although if I
were to be able to allow my thinking aspects to settle down, something quite extraordinary
might emerge as my experience. Something wildly unlike my common expectation and thought.
And of course I suspect this from experience. Having had some experiences like this or either
the tenor of my thinking mind changes, and we all know what that's like, right? The difference
between worrying about a problem or being excited about an experience or adventure. The difference
between washing the dishes and driving the car. The difference between when we're emerging moment
in deep relationship with someone. We might be laughing or playing or working on something
together. And when we're just clicking through Instagram posts or Twitter posts. Kind of
funny how the humans name technologies after animals. I suspect that there's more meaningful
content somehow in the chirping of a single hummingbird than there is in all of Twitter.
But of course there are different kinds of meaning. And this is where things get strange with language.
Because we have words that we suppose to refer somehow the supposition is it's not necessarily
natural it's taught to us. And we can unlearn it. But we have words that we think refer to the same
thing like meaning or love or even counting. And yet I guess part of the illusion here is just
that words have senses in the dictionary. And we suppose that the senses are sufficient and
complete for something. And also that the two things named it seems naturally to be expected
that two things named the same thing are reasonably dealt with in thought as the same thing. Yet
of course this is never so well it's actually not never so there are unique ways where where we
have made it so by how we use terms. For example the number one is an idea. But it could also be a
mark on a page or some bits in a machine. But there's a way in which we can abstract numerical
qualities so that one here and one there are understood to refer to the same thing. But
at how deep does that similarity go. Because unless those ones are appearing in the same mind at
the same time simultaneously they certainly can't be the same thing. So while it's not unreasonable
for us to treat them as the same for various purposes that we're interested in. Fundamentally
if there are two ones that are the same I cannot find them. I heard a couple talking earlier
and the man was saying we have a bunch of these at home and the woman said yes but they're not
the same ones. And it startled me for a moment. In a way both of their expressions are reasonable
yet we can see in how they form and express themselves that their concerns are different.
And when their concerns are different what is beheld is different. And this is one of the truly
astonishing things about being able to think representationally. There are all much like
our own humanity there are hidden assets in our common relationships with language also hidden
dangers. The capacity to think in language and concepts to do accounting to compare to evaluate
all of these representational behaviors have traditional forms in our in our actual human
experience. And many of these traditional forms are so crude as to act primarily as impediments
to intelligence while pretending that something else is going on. It's easy to collapse the
unknown and the diversely unique nature of experience and relation what we refer to as
reality. It's a little too easy to collapse it into casual language and think we've encompassed
it and somehow captured it. But mostly what we're capturing here is kind of our own tale. And I mean
that both in the sense that animals have tales and also in the sense of story. Because our
languages are emergent from the histories of humanity and life on earth. If I say you have a
tree you imagine something perhaps or perhaps you don't actually imagine anything visible. You
consider or reflect or if you're wanting to you will bring into consciousness some things about
trees in general or a generalized tree or something like this. And essentially what's
happening is we're having an idea that relates to kind of category theoretical set theoretical
framework. Trees have these properties they look approximately like this. Roots branches trunk
some stuff on the branches maybe fruit maybe leaves maybe needles maybe the branches are bare.
But even if I say think of a tree and I do this twice with you we do it together. Will the second
one be the same as the first one? Will our concerns color what our imaginations produce when we hear
the word tree or what we do with our minds when we're in conversation or reflecting, questing,
searching, trying to learn. Perhaps the man meant we have many plants like this at home perhaps the
woman meant they're not the same variety. But in order to derive those interpretations I have to
have concerns of some kind and those concerns will color my interpretations. And so it is with
every movement of our minds. Our concerns or purposes our skin in the game the way we're in
the world our history what we've been doing over the past few minutes the context that we're immersed
in in our homes cars offices in the wild all of these will color our interpretations. And unfortunately
in the context of the inside of a box looking at a screen computer our context is manipulated by
responses to the past few previous cycles of stimuli very deeply related to these things.
So that we will interpret a text we read very differently if something comes before it that
enchants us or if something comes before it before it that upsets us or angers us. The next thing
we read will inherit some of the qualities of tone intention concern that were previously present
in our awareness or body and our bodies because our bodies change when we have emotions. It's not
all cerebral in fact very little of it is cerebral and I I strongly suspect that things going on in
our bodies have much more to do with what we think and feel than we might ordinarily imagine a lot
more. I suspect that cellular metabolism affects things like mood and orientation even concern.
When I heard the man and the woman speaking and they were just very casually chatting I happened
to overhear them. Thought it might be interesting to explore the idea of what does one mean.
How do you get from everything to something. And one of the things that's important here is that
there are different domains in which we will become concerned about one and what what it is what it
does. And so value is a many petal flower and so too is number. It's not much like the simple way we
usually think about it and partly we're inventing it. Though that's a complex discussion and of
course I don't expect to succeed in my interest in learning about one together today. The topics
conceivably infinite. In fact perhaps most topics are infinite and this is part of why we want to
snip off the infinity in various different kinds of ways or not just the infinity the the array of
infinities that emerge once one begins to distinguish anything at all. We want to snip those off and
have a convenient tag for the remains a tree. And though we know what I mean when I use the word
tree it doesn't really have anything to do much with any actual tree. In fact it's kind of a way
of throwing away the infinities producing a token that we can manipulate in various ways some of
them usefully purposeful some of them very dangerous be confused. But this whole idea of one what is
one lies at the basis of every of all of our urges fears desires. One case of cancer is very different
from one winning lottery ticket which is very different from spending an hour
with someone you adore together who adores you. Sorry all different kinds of ones but they're not
very similar. And part of how we get to one is by throwing away infinities we narrow the scope.
But there are ways of narrowing the scope that largely evict lived experience embodied experience
embodied relation and produce a layer that's very abstract useful and apparently effective in
thinking he apparently has a asterisk on it. Not muchly related to the complexities.
It pretends to dissect for us.
I think the idea of classes is at once really you know our categories it's really useful and it's also
it can be very confusing if we're not able to educate ourselves very carefully about it.
Because if I use the word tree really what I'm pointing at there is a class or a set
and we also have things
that that word refers to that aren't like the
the living being that we call a tree or the expression of life on earth that we call a tree
or the expression of the nature and character of time space that we call a tree.
Here you can see in those three examples
very different ways of thinking about what is a tree being
and perhaps each tree is being treeish in ways it shares with other trees
but it's certainly being treeish in ways no other tree can share unless the trees
are somewhat like a living network that the beings who dwell there in can travel in
in which case they could be different trees.
Sounds fantastical perhaps most of what I've come to understand about nature
is more than any fantastical thing we can invent it's truly staggeringly unexpected
rich diverse infinite profound alive sensitive beautiful adoring
astonishing the onset of our capacity to
form the idea of one something a separate specific possibly concrete possibly continuously
present thing right now I'm looking at a street cone
and it seems to be continuously present and frankly out here in the wild part of the garden
it's really out of place
it really looks distinct
but it's a very peculiar one it's old and much of the die has worn off and the top is cracked and
broken and it's a thing of rubber
it's an artifact
made by humans
and they're really good at producing ones like this
we have machines that make endless ones endless packets of ketchup
endless light bulbs endless shoelaces endless little plastic containers for endless substances
some of them terribly poisonous others perhaps intoxicating
our species seems to be very interested in the production of these artifacts
perhaps more interested in that than anything else at least
at the orders where
we are collectives or we participate in collectives
that problem has a history in the structure we can meaningfully examine learn to understand
but it's not my intention to wander in that direction at the moment
I'm much more interested in one and the astonishing difference between the capacity
that might emerge first in our cognitive development to distinguish one
to understand that is one something or this one is the one I love
how how shocking a development must be to go from that to two
the entire universe of possibility changes forever because with two you can have harmony
you can have polarity you can have qualities of the second thing that transform the nature of
the first thing and back and forth all of these astonishing possibilities emerge to our
the minds with which we think and of course many of these things I'm talking about have non-verbal
aspects there's a kind of how to put this I often think about you know different layers
of a situation to help me organize my thought and to keep me from collapsing it to you know one
thing oh it's just this it's just that blah blah that move tends to be an abandonment of any
kind of concern about learning oh it's just a blah blah blah that's one of the ultimate
de-infinitizing moves there are no infinities associated with that it's just this right and
where we can be done with it and weirdly that's one of the concerns
that underlies the peculiar development of our cognitive inheritance so our representational
inheritance is the concern to be done with having to concern yourself with something
if I can classify things in such a way that maps relatively well to threats and opportunities
then I don't have to remain hyper vigilant at all moments the the way some of the small birds
in the garden are although they too have um rest they too settle down fluff up hang out with a friend
they're brilliant for little birds
the field is so broad in my concern about our interest in you know one that I'm not really sure
precisely where to go
so
I think one of the things that's easily lost as we become habituated to language and
human culture common thought and speech
is we may be inclined to forget that thinking and speaking are intentional acts
and if our intentions are different they produce different results
because effectively it isn't as though we have a mind we don't have one mind
and it's not even clear that we have anything at all many other perspectives are also at least
likely if not probable one of them being we participate you can immediately see that if we
weren't participating with many minds we would not acquire or invent language right and so all
of these concerns would not be going on we would not be having this discussion I wouldn't be curious
about one I'm not sure how it would be but it wouldn't be like this
we learn and form habits and then practice them and I think too many of them are
habits of desperation from the loneliness
that is for so many of us profoundly a part of our modern experience
and in isolation our intentions change and are more easily manipulated from without
without having to name what kinds of constructs want to manipulate it and why
but all around there are motives interpretations evaluations a kind of honestly terrifying
plethora of accounting games and courtroom dramas about is that one or not is that the good one
is that a bad one what should we do with this one who who is the one we are what is the one we are
together but I think the oldest and perhaps one of the most fruitful parts of the question
is how do we get from everything to something presuming that that's how we make a one or something
in my model of the tree concept where I distinguished
the plant slash commodity humans might refer to with this term or the living being in the living
place an expression of its lineages and histories and ancestral beings an expression of the living
place alive here with me perhaps transcendent more than merely sentient but certainly not
inert or mechanical and then the perspective of ah these living beings all around us these are the
these are the embodied expressions of the nature and character of time space itself or the universe
and perhaps even the universe is an expression of something we have not been able to form a
reasonable concept around and that's not too surprising that we don't have a reasonable
concept about what the universe might be an expression of the word tree the human concept for tree
ah
is not a tree
and the word is a one and the tree is a one
but the word exists in a mind's representational overlays the tree is
is infinitely it is
very different ones
often those I know will think of people they will say something about people
and they might say those ones
to indicate a subset of people those ones who are mean for example or those ones who are kind
and these of course presume that there are ones who are always mean or always kind and they're
you know out there in the world it's a it's a pointer it points at something an image
an idea and evaluation we formed in consciousness
but that idea and those words are not people
people are all kinds of unique things moment to moment and they transform
to you know depending on context and relation history need opportunity threat perception
so when I hear people say
as I just did
when I hear those known to me actually say something like oh people are mean
or people are dumb or people are bad in some particular way
I become concerned
it seems a misuse of one
someone I care deeply about the other night
was very concerned
that everyone was interested in destroying him
all of the ones
and I asked him to pause and think carefully about this
do you really mean everyone yes everyone
well are you sure there's like little babies and old ladies in India and stuff who
he and he said oh oh I see oh I see it's not everyone
that gentle soul
has been injured by
the habits of language
that seem so authoritative
that they should supervene over minds
that language should tell minds what to be and do and so to beings
and what is good and bad and much and little and hot and cold and so on
and this is one of the dangers of being formally representational cognitives in the way that we
humans are other animals certainly have
familiar assets that they've developed very differently for different purposes and
none
there don't seem to there does not seem to be on earth another animal like ours that's in the same
developmental problem our species is in and since we're so prolific and momentous around here
in terms of animals we're a threat to all the others the threats we suffer they must share
sometimes I think
that humans are really a strange experiment
a strange and audacious experiment an experiment
that might have been begun under the most urgent of imperatives
but I also think we're an expression of something primordial
and that we're very very different from our tools
we're easily enchanted by our tools including the tool of language perhaps
most foundationally this tool but also the tool of numerism
these gifts are magical in the sense that they're exceptionally powerful in a very peculiar way
that can change from benevolence to catastrophe
more easily than we might imagine more often than we might imagine
if we're not trained to treat them with care and awareness about the specific dangers and opportunities
that emerge from our circumstances and the time we live in
we imagine that humans when we say humans we're saying something about one thing but we're not
we're saying something about everything we're we're taking the scope of everything and looking at it through the lens of
a class we imagine in our thought stretching out perhaps over time
I mean if I just say the word humans do I mean the ones living now do I mean do I mean just the ones alive right this instant
what's the temporal scope it's not clear this is a problem in our language the temporal scope of identity
is made permanent and overarching it's over authorized surely we know that the tree was once a seed or even a flower or some pollen
and we know that it will be a tree and it will
engage in infinite relationships as a tree and then it will dissolve
more trees will be there but not that tree not this one
the humans are such a mysterious animal to me
how do you get an animal as astonishingly beautiful and confusable as the kinds of animals we are
and when we say human I think we suppose that humans have always been humans and as far as the class
theoretic stuff goes or the set theoretic stuff goes that's not entirely unreasonable
but in terms of thinking deeply or meaningfully about it no humans have been
and are different all over the place for all their similarities
be funny to see something to meet another intelligence that used categories for entirely
different purposes than we do we could learn a lot from this and I don't know if the dolphins
and whales and primates and birds and insects have you know categories the way we do
but I think they have something similar
it's probably just not as formal and it's not linguistic in the ways or at least it's
if anything it's proto or meta linguistic
hmm
we often think in generalizations but nearly all of our actual experiences with very specific
places moments beings situations and so our language and our thinking often
become desynchronized
our attention and concern and awareness can be too easily led by concepts and particularly I
think as human beings as modern human beings we're vulnerable to narratives which are
something a bit like a story description
although consciousness has probably been developing in myriads of human lives
forever essentially since there were organisms that led to their being humans and so on and so
forth the particular character and inclinations of modern consciousness are surprisingly new
and it's not just that they're all new see again here's the problem with language
some of them are brand new right in terms of developmental time some of them are really
really new they're like a year old of course one year in human time is a lot of time since
there are 7.8 billion humans so if they're one year old they're uniquely one year old in 7.8 billion
ways how old is that see the problem with temporal scope
if 7.8 billion humans experience a minute how much time is that and are the humans really
distinct in the way that our language imagines because we're emergently woven into
the life of time space and of the world and of all the living beings
we have these sort of very difficult we have these properties that are extremely difficult
and confusing to try to capture in the language that we're used to using in the ways we're used
to using it we can learn about these things so that it's possible to speak intelligently
and to understand that identity has a temporal scope but we can also understand that identity
which is related to you know what we mean by one one what one where one how one who one why one reason
if we include temporal scope and identity if we include if we include different versions of
relational scope so that we understand that identity isn't nearly a property possessed
it's not like things and beings are containers the way we might be inclined to think about them
or speak about them in English we think my mind is inside me my soul is inside me
I'm a container for my mind and my soul and my anatomy
and while that perspective isn't entirely useless useless or unreasonable it's
insufficiently sophisticated to help us much if we want to think about identity or one intelligently
for accounting purposes ones are perfectly distinguished things dollars for example
the dollar is a really strange thing because it's a mostly valueless thing
that because we all imagine and agree is it is valuable
well many diverse repercussions and institutions and habits and behaviors and
activities and concerns emerge from that decision
and you can see in the idea of one dollar
the the motivation to distinct perfectly distinguish one actual thing
complete unto itself de-infinitized manipulable exchangeable a commodity a token
one of the things the token can get rid of though he can also catalyze this his relationships
we don't have to have the relationship if we can pay the money or rather the nature of the
relationship will become transactional less like two beings in agreement more like two
beings with a representation of agreement that we call dollars
cleans up the mess of the infinity of variables involved in actual agreements and relationships
rather nicely unfortunately also produces versions of humanity that are self-terminating
egregiously disoriented and so on self and other terminating
but there are some very profound
instances of union one identity nearby
though it's not the beginning or the end of the story earth is one world
and all the beings here are one family
and these are things we can say in language to point
at blatantly obvious perspectives that we could have if we were lifted out
of our local awareness into for example outer space where the astronauts reported seeing
the planet and just being completely overwhelmed and realizing oh my god it's a tiny little island
in a vast and endless ocean it's just one island
and really there's just one you could think this way anyway there's there's one animal here
that expresses itself in billions of different ways there's one being here that expresses itself
in billions of different ones but that's much more theoretical
the sun is very obviously one nearby really pretty benevolent star
and the moon is one
though of course
with the the bright side and the dark side we see suddenly the emergence of two and with
day and night we see the emergence of two
there is the one when the sun is here and there is the one when the sun is gone hiding
you know one of the perhaps fascinating things to explore about one is
am i the same one i was
i have the same name
i have a body that seems continuous in time space even though it's
transforming constantly
it's almost like i'm something that rides the transformations of my body through time space
but yeah the temporal scope of identity applies to us as well
if i think for example oh i remember the day i did something really beautiful
um i rescued that that animal or i helped someone who was in trouble needed a friend
which me was there i'm having a relationship with memory which is a lot like a relationship
with dreaming i imagine that that was the same person that i am today i have the same name
such my social security number hasn't changed
but am i that same one and someone in a conversation the other night about
a related topic said something that really knocked me out of my chair
they said that humans are the only animal that walks through the world feeling culpable
or i'm paraphrasing it slightly the the actual statement was simpler
but it might have been why are we an animal that walks through the world feeling culpable
and of course to feel culpable
requires certain extensions to the scope of identity over time
you must imagine that i am the same person now
in all the ways that matter that i was then if i am to take credit or to blame myself or be punished
you know whatever
to feel embarrassed for a shame
and so there's this really strange thing about the relationship between time and one
i don't know what the relationship is
between my memory of having done something and my identity when i'm recalling that
and this leads off there's a branch here that would be fun to follow
but is too fraught with mystery
and the branch has to do with what's all this memory stuff going on what is memory
and you can see that ideas and language are ways of structuring memory
so that it holds a form over time and this particular feature is astonishing
and creates the possibility of something resembling time travel in consciousness
or in awareness and thought and concern
and one particularly precocious man said that the salient feature of our humanity
in speaking in ways that defy his own admonitions against doing this
but is that we are time binders we bind
ideas language habits theories knowledge and transmit it generation to generation
somewhat transform it but also keep it stable
and he was very concerned about the dangers of such a situation as am i
and i'm not sure i agree with him about the salient feature
but it's certainly an important aspect and was useful his ideas were very useful
i'm talking about alfre korzybski the author of science and sanity
one of the strangest books i've ever come across and a truly brilliant and important book
but one that i doubt would be accessible to wide audiences
in any case
part of why one way to understand something about why there's an animal that feels culpable
is or descends from our peculiar relationship with thought language evaluation and memory
these things but of course without memory all of this discussion disappears
right and so you can see that language and knowledge are like taking
the substance of memory and forming it into
structured frameworks with internal coherence and that last
and these frameworks survive in human minds and lives and they reproduce in human minds and lives
and ours transformed and stabilized in human minds and lives and perhaps other minds are
participating with ours minds of forms we've been too timid to imagine i suspect something like this
is going on but it's difficult to talk about it and you can see the problem here right because
if other minds are participating in ours then my mind is not one it might not even be mine
it could be something i'm doing with myriad other beings
right that i have a particular idea about i have an explanation of what my mind is which
is a pretty strange thing to have by the way
without memory
it's very difficult to have language or concern or even computation
even in our machines we have the sort of processors that transform
essential data but we have memory within which the transformations take place
and within which we build structured frameworks to manipulate the data for purposes we're interested in
so it's in a way it simulates a very narrow aspect an abstract sort of an abstraction
of a narrow array of functions minds may perform
now it is the evening chorus of the birds here
the dawn and evening choruses of the birds
are one of the most amazing and beautiful things i've ever experienced in my life as a human being
language and knowledge i'll say again
are like magic
we could imagine a story where
something cast a spell on our people
and our peculiar relationships with language and knowledge
are the shadow aspect of that spell we're under
but when i call them magical i just mean they are non-ordinary
there are dangers associated with them we should look very carefully into
and there are opportunities associated with them
that we could make wise and intelligent use of
some ones might argue all of this is very philosophical the ordinary person doesn't need this
now i'm imagining people who would make this argument i'm not saying there are actually
people that i know that will and this is an example of our capacity to imagine critics
a very strange feature of our uniquely human
need for to be positively observed and our desire not to be negatively observed
and these are deeply felt and embodied aspects of the human
we would like to be seen when and how we would like to be seen
we would not like to be seen where and when we do not wish to be seen
and language
is a presentation
it's a display phenomenon
where we're signaling to others nearby usually sometimes far away
for purposes we become concerned with interested in
or desire to avoid
to be without the thinking mind for a moment is an astonishing thing
any experience of this will transform
our thought if we're available to such transformation
and it's kind of fascinating that for most of us when we lay down to go to sleep
or when we finally fall asleep
the thinking mind fades off trails away
and the resources that i think are ordinarily
shunted into the very expensive process of
having thoughts and then reacting to those in one's body and then having more thoughts
and then reacting to those
now process doesn't entirely disappear but it certainly transforms
in astonishing and beautiful ways when we dream
but who's dreaming
is that a different one for me is there two
is there more than two
what is one
where is the one of me
where is the one i am
the simple answer is my body
in my mind there can be many many minds
they change and transform
in circumstances, concern, context
but my body is the familiar ongoing vessel of my being for now
the sun is setting and listening to the birds and a few other animals singing
i want to let go of my intellect
and all of its sophistication
and just be alive for a moment
in the astonishing beauty and ancient agreements
of the universe and this living world that i adore so deeply
may your own dreaming and wonder questions and learning be deep and rich and beautiful
i look forward to our next adventure thank you
