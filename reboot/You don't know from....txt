Hello, everybody. Welcome.
I've been listening to
Danny Jones
interviewing Neil from
Nassau Conformant. I can't recall his last name at the moment.
It's like Senniak.
Something like this. Fairly interesting.
And this is obviously
one of the things that's going on with Danny's podcast at the moment, Concrete,
is that clearly he's exploring the
world around
Hillman.
And
Neil has a lot of interesting historical
perspective and information. Neil is an
autodidact. He was not educated like me.
He's a self-educating person. He follows his passions
and his interests. And he became interested in these
topics through what he called
studying his way out of Christianity, which is a very interesting thing
to say.
There's a lot of good information.
Neil is very supportive of Amon's
classicism,
his Greek scholarship.
One of the things that Neil says is that most of the people that are attacking
Amon's
perspectives, I will call them.
Just basically attack it from the place of, we'll know,
the agreed upon knowledge,
right? The, what do you call it?
Consensus.
By the way, that's basically just like saying with
the numbers, with the census.
And this is the adpopulus,
historical fallacy. Well, most people think, who gives a flying
poop storm what most people think?
Let's be really clear. If we go with generalities
and generalizations, we're only going to miss
everything important.
Because what will be overlooked is everything that
everything that opposes popular consensus.
And in our situation with the moderns,
the educational level of the common people, if we take
you know, if we,
how would I put this? If we adulterate
the pool with
the entire scope
of the numbers, we're going to find
and we got to include people who are so old their memory doesn't
work yet. We also have to include children and stuff who have
no formal education speak of or not much
yet. So if we
dilute the numbers with the common
people, what you get is basically just stupidity.
Like bald
inveterate ignorance.
Which you can see very commonly in the United States
in our political situation. You have two species
of catastrophic stupidity, you know,
assembling golems in public to war against each other
for the sake of what? Who has nothing to do with running a country,
I'll put it that way. It has a lot to do with lining pockets
and
sustaining lineages of socio-political
economic war, prison,
you know, power, back room power
exchanges.
The currying of favor and favor trading
and so on, which is the opposite of what a democracy
should be about.
In any case, one of the things that was bothering me is that
both Neil and Danny
with all due respect, Danny is
catastrophically naive about anything relating
to spirituality. I'm pretty sure
he's an atheist and
it's, you know, Danny asks
Neil if he's religious and he just says anything but.
So Neil is also
hopefully my wind buffer is going to work here. I did test it a bit.
So Neil is also
what? I'm not going to say he's an atheist.
As far as I can tell, he's anti-metaphysical.
He doesn't believe there's anything like souls or spirits or gods
or diamonds or angels or anything.
And, you know, I'm reminded
of experts on fishing
who've never held a rod.
And this analogy turns out to be really important here in all kinds of ways.
They've never seen a fish. They live in the
desert. They don't believe in fishes. Fishes are a
story that crazy people tell.
And the crazy people are so insane
that these desert dwellers, and these aren't like the
Bedouins who actually have wisdom and stuff. These are idiots.
These are people who live in a world of their own suppositions.
No experience of the things that they speak of. This is what I was talking about in my
recording about knowledge and writing and the problem that
that produces. It also produces amazing
possibilities of learning and the exchange of
the transfer of knowledge on a broader scope than person to person
by song and oral tradition and transfer. That's true.
It does do that, but it comes with very lethal dangers.
Historically the humans tend to ignore the dangers of their new technologies
and then what happens is
the structures of power,
the under structure,
the sort of malignant under structures
of power and wealth
and rape and torture and lying and
not the good kind of lying, not the aurea.
No, no, the kind
of lying that leads to the immiseration of
thousands or millions of people over epochs of time, that kind
of lying. This all gets supported by this process.
What we have here are people, I can't really speak much about
Danny Jones, and it's not my intent to insult him
or to be disrespectful
but it's clear just from listening to him
he sounds like an 11 year old kid
knowing absolutely nothing about the topic
and look, he's interviewed a good, I don't know what his numbers are
but a good probably 500 or 1000 people
very deep minds, very rich
in intelligence. Strangely
his own intellect appears
largely immune to these intelligences
and I find it tragic
this is the problem with the claim
of knowledge, these people are talking
I don't care what they believe and they're welcome to believe
whatever they like or disbelieve whatever they like
they're talking about things they have no experience of
just like people in the desert who make up stories and say
there's these people in the west
and they say that you can go to the end of the world and if you go there you will see the great water
that fills the whole horizon, those people are insane
it's not possible for there to be great waters like that
there's no chance of it being true
water as far as you can see to the horizon
all the way around you, those people are doing, those are drunkards
and silly people, they're just making shit up
which is effectively what they're saying
they're saying Neil studies
the origins of religion
and he's an interesting cat
and he has a lot of name based
date based, place based
like you see on those detective shows
there's a wall where all of the major players
and situations and the timeline is there and there's a web of red threads
between all the stuff, Neil's mind is a bit like this
which is super cool for all it's worth
in terms of trying to understand
classicism
what happened in the ancient world
where did we get, did the Masoretic text come before the Greek
Septuagint or vice versa and why
and so forth
Neil's defending Amin primarily by saying that
his detractors cite
consensus, well the consensus is obviously that
Masoretic text precedes the Greek, but when you look at the actual numbers
at least
from some of the people that Neil has been interviewing, some of whom are
lifelong scholars of these matters, so not trivial
idiots who, these aren't political theorists
I think, nope, it's nothing like that
these are people who have spent their entire lifetime studying
in the archives and in universities and all around the world
some of them are probably even in the Vatican libraries
which must be catastrophically astonishing
um
many of these people think
that we should ask questions
about the texts
and their origins, so he's defending
some of what Amin is saying
and also by saying that the people who are trying
to refute Amin are not citing much
they're really just saying well the consensus has long been
particularly if you see on YouTube some ridiculously
titled video, Amin Hillman debunked
well what a load of bullshit that is, there's no debunking of Amin
first of all you can't debunk a human being, let's just be really clear, Amin Hillman exists
so, you know, the text is already
stupidifyingly
pitifully titled, just insane
can't debunk a human being, Amin Hillman debunked
what are you debunking, you're debunking your own intelligence in language
so what you can debunk is a claim
not a human being, let's be really clear about that
that little 10 minute video, can't recall
don't even care to recall, the name of the guy who
obviously a friend of Dan McClellands who
has his panties in a bunch about Hillman
and I would argue doesn't even understand, has no chance of understanding
what Hillman is doing because what Hillman is doing
isn't history of religion
it's related, it's related
and it has an influence in that domain
but what Hillman is doing is
magical, it's not scholarly
there's features of it that are academic and scholarly, he's drawing on his
education as a classicist and his fascinations
particularly with ancient Greek
Galen, known as others
everywhere there's these machines
even in the park, the gardens
driving machines around, in any case
what Hillman is doing
is initiatory
he's time traveling, it's like he's opening up
a window to a lost world
inside himself, he's opening up this window, this portal
if you will, and he's transporting us back
he's giving us a
there must be a word for this where
where you are in time is flipped around
in exchange for another place in time
that's what Hillman is up to
in his
paramaniacal
dissertations
and the actual origins
of what's in the Bible, particularly the New Testament
but not merely that
and
you know
Hillman's been accused of various kinds of nefarious activities
I don't know
what the verity of those activities might be
basically
he was specifically accused apparently by some
feature of the Catholic church
of summoning demons
opening portals
he's definitely opening portals
he's trying to understand
he's trying to understand
he's trying to understand
what the origins of the often absurdly
ridiculous things we believe in modernity
he's trying to understand
the history of these situations
and when he uses the word history
he doesn't mean a record of what happened
he means to inquire of those with actual knowledge
intimate knowledge
the kind of knowledge you have of your lover's mouth when you kiss them
that kind of knowledge
that kind of knowledge
direct somatic, visceral
spiritual, originary experience
not thinking, not opinions
not ideas
and he doesn't give a flying fuck about consensus
nothing, does not care
in fact he will blatantly declare
that this consensus thing
is completely delusional
nothing there at all
he will yell out
everything you think
all those thoughts you have, all those ideas, all those stuff you've been taught
all of that, nonsense
and then he'll go off camera and you'll hear spanking sounds
now look nobody has to
authorize Hillman
you don't have to bow to him
he's not running around saying worship me, I am the truth and the light
what he's saying is if you want a taste
of the ancient world
that's much more like what was almost certainly going on
than what you've been told, we will go together
using the ancient greek as a vehicle of travel
travel in what? travel
in pneumaticon
in the friends
in the strands
the threads, the tributaries
of our own origins, our minds, our consciousness
our awareness, our souls
the spectral body, the soma pneumaticon of the greeks
he will spin that up
and take us far beyond
anything we've ever been exposed to
for those who want to go
it's an opt-in thing
he's not telling the world what to believe or the scholars
but he will openly laugh at them
and piss in their faces
happily, joyfully, playfully
what they've been trained to think
they're doing the same
kind of thing that they like to accuse him of
they're very selectively picking certain senses of certain words
that match up not with history
not with the consensus of primary sources
which consensus hillman may well
characterize
they're excluding what they don't want to hear
why did hillman have to exclude all references to recreational drugs from his dissertation
when the use of drugs by the Romans
was probably the primary focus of his phd dissertation
why was he told to exclude these
because it was said by the gatekeepers
of the institution the Romans would not do this
what? what? the Romans were doing this
of course they were doing this, we do this
every people who have ever lived have done this
and what is this, we use intoxicants
and sometimes psychedelics and other sedatives
and other things
but if you experience anesthesia in the surgery
this is what he's talking about
so
his detractors are doing the same thing
they're promoting specific
senses of words in Greek
and or Hebrew
and they are ignoring
the senses that don't agree with their pre-existing narratives and biases
many of which are ridiculously
it's the right word, mcdonnellized
jack in the bible
eyesed
so
frankly, I think it's weird
when people like Danny
opine on religious topics
or metaphysical topics
I don't know his whole history, I don't pay a lot of attention to him
but if he has any direct experience of metaphysical
the world outside what you are thinking
is 99% of the universe
0.999
basically everything isn't what you like to think
is the truth of reality
that which is, we might call it, all that is
and Danny's over there trying to think his way through that
good luck, Dan
it's the thumbnail of your pinky
for something that needs to become the palm of your hand
and replace your representational cognition for you to understand it
in other words, they're literally arguing about people being possessed
and laughing about it, him and Neil
neither of whom apparently believe in possession which I think is hilarious
because clearly
it seems very clear to me
and I'd love to ask him questions about this
but if Amon himself has not experienced various kinds of possession
particularly by his muse
the dead girl he talks about
when he says he has a cheat in the
the podcast by
who speaks
when he talks about this dead girl who resurrects
the ancients before him one by one
so that he may inquire directly of them
if he's not experiencing something resembling possession
I'd love to know what it is that he is experiencing
and these two young men
apparently and by the way
you can disbelieve something to such a degree
that it either kills you or blinds you
in the same way that you can believe something to such a degree that it kills you or blinds you
you can disbelieve that food is nourishing and die of intonation
you can disbelieve that you need water, you don't need water
dead 34 days later
you can say there's no objective evidence for love
that's just something people made up to amuse themselves
you won't have any experience of love
there are certain features of being human
and I would argue that many if not most of the features of being human are like this
where if you decide that they don't exist
you become incapable of participating in them
unless something comes and overwhelms
your
your blatant ignorance
there's a word I'm looking for that I can't quite find
unless something comes and just overwhelms you and takes you over
which by the way is pretty much and I'm not recommending the use of psychedelic drugs here
but that's what happens when one does psychedelic drugs
either nothing happens
which is what happened to me the first eight or nine times I smoked weed
nothing happened similarly my friend Alan Steinfeld
when we were talking the other day he was like the first time I looked at a television it was just incoherent
I couldn't tell what the hell that was or what was going on there
and he's right
it's because the form of our cognition
this idea that
the crazy people have
that what your mind reveals to you is what exists
and what it doesn't reveal doesn't exist
that is impossible there's no chance of that being true
the mind reforges its own anatomy
in order to reveal or occlude
features of potential relation
history future possibility
and if the mind has never taken on a particular form before
it doesn't know what to do with the information
and so it may generate literally it may just knock you out
I've had direct experience of this
with things that other people think are completely ordinary and happen all the time
your first experience of eating food
with your mouth that wasn't just milk was probably like this
your first experience of standing up was like this
my first experiences of relation
erotic relation with women
and my teens were so like this
that it was like going to another universe
so this idea that you're the arbiter of identity function situation
circumstance and you just declare
what's happening and what's isn't
you can go ahead and play the game of consciousness that way
Neil, Danny, go ahead, be my guest
this is the most of what it means to be human
and from your weird little isolated castle
or your dungeon of naivete
you're going to make ex-cathedra declarations that you think
other people are just either having us on
this is what the left hemisphere would say about everything
that it doesn't originate, grip, control
and also anything that would threaten its supremacy and consciousness
and by the left hemisphere what do I really mean? I don't mean
the left cerebral hemisphere
what I mean is certain features
that we know have an intimate relation
with that hemisphere from having done experiments with stroke victims
and from having done the water test
where we anesthetize one of the hemispheres and we ask the person questions
and we can talk to them later about their experiences and so forth
we know that there are
faculties from which
there are faculties that representational cognition relies
fundamentally upon and these faculties are tyrannical
you can see them in actual tyrants
they're spun up in people like Mr. Trump
and other tyrannical
nightmarish folks from history
who probably need not be named here
so there's this aspect
again it's like the fingernail on your pinky or the tip of your pinky
screaming at the rest of the hand, you don't exist
you've never seen a ghost, there's no such thing as possession
I mean that's the hilarious irony is these people who say
there's no such thing as possession, okay really?
because you are possessed by an array of faculties that are declaring that
and you are unaware of your possession
and think that what you have is the antithesis or opposite of
possession, when there's no chance that's true
there's no chance, the irony here is 10 miles thick
you're possessed by a tiny little array
of your cognitive faculties, a little tiny island, an archipelago
in consciousness, and that archipelago is saying
many things it's not from around here, doesn't exist, those other islands have ocean
stuff like that, it's not there
there is no boatman, boats are a fantasy dreaming thing
something very close to me last night was arguing
fiercely that romantic love was just an invention
made up by poets that everyone decided was a good idea afterwards
he's not entirely wrong
but neither is he correct because the mind
can reforge its anatomy
and under some circumstances that can
be extrinsically, not exactly forced
but very forcefully catalyzed
and so this is really important to understand
if you are a person like Danny or Neil
who thinks they know things about what it means to be human
what's real and what's not real, you don't
you're wrong, you're using
paint, it's like you're using one book in a
library or one angle
of a sphere to determine what is true
real good, veritable, trustworthy and so forth
Alan Steinfeld who I recently did a beginning interview with
spoke about his first
experience with a trans channel and he said
in the interview
I met this man
and I thought, okay, either A
he is psychotic
B, he's a really, really good actor
or C, and this is
the voice of the left hemisphere's incredible doubt and skepticism
or C, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
he said maybe like 12 times
maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe, maybe
there's something going on here that I don't understand
Alan was a very intelligent, well educated person
and then
so
so then later he was at a performance
where this, actually I can't remember
I think it's a woman who is the channel and she channels
an ancient warrior
his name is something like Rampha
this channel is very famous, one of the first trans channels
he was at a
performance, the channel picked him
out of the audience, pointed at him, he very reluctantly
someone said, you mean me, right, like, are you talking to me? and then the channel
said yes, in very elaborate ancient
pre-shakesperean English
yes, my beloved you, you know
Alan had a full on, suddenly, very rapidly
the whole tabloo changed, he said that the theater
filled with a kind of, I'm paraphrasing here, like a glowing mist
and he rose kind of out of his body and they
embraced and he had this experience unlike anything he'd ever had before
and, you know, you can argue whatever you like, ah, hypnosis
blah blah blah, I wasn't there, I didn't see that, ah, it's just hearsay
go ahead, be my guest, right, you can argue the same thing about the flavor of food
right, the experience of the, you're not seeing red, that's just
blah blah blah, make up any noises you like, you can make all the
face noises you want and you can have all of the
critical left hemispheric refutations, be my guest
you're welcome to have them, you're wrong, you're just dead wrong
you're missing, the thing you're using to determine what is real
is only useful
in a very very tiny scope
of human experience, nature
being, thought, awareness,
consciousness, all these things, very tiny scope
it's very useful if you want to tell is that pot hot or cold
very useful there, you know, how many coins
are in my pocket, very useful there
beyond its applicable scope
those faculties are lethal
to understanding, they crucify it, they basically
rip out its organs and spray them on the wall
so if you think that you know what's going on based on your rationality
you not only don't know what's going on
you're like a bird that thinks only this one feather
on my wing, on my left wing
or in this case my right wing, because birds are similarly lateralized
to us, only this one feather
can I trust, which guess what that means
that means that you will never fly and you're a bird
you're born to be sky born
you're born for the wind to just lift you up
into the atmosphere, into the sunlight
to dance with the clouds
this is what you're born for and you're really focused on this one feather and you're like well I've never seen anything
incline me to believe blah, blah, blah, blah
okay, good luck
and everybody, lots of us start out there, the problem is some of us finish there
and
I have my own biases and perspectives, I too can, I've experienced delusion
I've also experienced
manic insight, manic insight
paranoia, grandiose
yes, yes, I've had these experiences
and of course we want to be protected from them
we don't want to, we don't want our buffers
so permeable that anything gets in
and that's part of why rationality reigns
supreme is because we're really afraid of
the contagion of madness
okay, I get it, but there's other approaches
that allow us to explore
our nature, our
origin, our intelligences, our creativity
our participatory
transcendence and this is very crucial that we have these
experiences so we need a buffer
against
having the membrane completely ruined
by nonsense
which is conceivable
but we still need a trustworthy and worthy array
of incitements
maps, teachers, mentors
and perhaps daimons to lead us
out
of the prison nearing cage of mere rationality
that's it for now
more soon, thank you for joining me and your paths to be beautiful
and your relationships loving
and your dreams amazing, bye bye for now
