our species there were very few situations where individuals
were common though there were unusual persons whose relationship with their
originating peoples became very unusual there have always been those there have always been
something that resembles a doctor something that resembles a philosopher something that
resembles a seer or a prophet something that resembles a scout or a ranger something that
resembles a knight a kind of a blessed battle knight who takes on weird difficult enemies
there've always been these kinds of things these kinds of roles and persons in human history
always in fact if you go back very far you're probably going to find that
if you could just transport yourself back to such a situation as a as an unseen observer say
um as an observer that having no effect the first problem you run into is someone would
realize you are the seen them right they can't see you but somebody will realize that you're
seeing them little girl old woman you know the unusual teenage boy who sees things and
and doesn't speak in the same vernacular you see that's part of the payload of the language
it's vernacular that's the word I was the concept I was looking for it's part of the payload it's
not the whole thing there's a bunch of games about value and identity how to evaluate when to
evaluate um again you can see this problem where it's very it really like English really is more
like kinglish right I'm the god of the world I could say whatever I want I can do whatever I want
you know right like I have no there is no constraining web of conserved traditions relationships
heritages lineages families that's all gone you're on your own with a gun I mean this is
the proposition right you got a car I'm just remembering that that crazy quote
from wise blood I think it is that was used so brilliantly in the beginning of Jesus built my
hot rod how does it go man I used to be able to do it with fervor she's it even worth it if I can
where you come from is gone where you thought you're going weren't never there
it goes on something about like nobody with a good car need to worry about nothing
and this is the spirit of the English we are taught it's you are alone you're by yourself
you are an individual you determine what is true what is good what is wrong what is evil
you know locally yourself you make all the decisions you make all the evaluations
somehow you're supposed to be as intelligent as a group of seven people with 12 different
kinds of skills all by yourself and the insecurity that the inward insecurity that this naturally
generates this lack of one's inaction people which is counterfeited in jobs and companies right
this lack of approval reassurance cooperation playful you know
leaping up the developmental ladders together while resolving important like actually noble
mission that matter this is built into our people and compromised by our culture
we were not all born for the same thing but we were not born to be isolates there were isolates
occasionally there were scouts who didn't live in the camp right they traveled with the people
maybe in a tribe right they would travel with them but they were never there
they were always out and they would come back and bring intelligence about you know the extended
terrain and what they saw and sensed in it that kind of thing and you can see that in a way many
humans try to do this they're trying to do it all humans have a deep relationship with predicting
the future we pretend in our materialist worldview this is supposed to be impossible
life organisms on earth have been doing that since fucking cell number one
there's nothing on earth that doesn't do that and if someone asks me will show me the physical
evidence what i'm probably going to say is the blinders that you're currently wearing are so thick
that the evidence your own hand comprises evades you
how will i show you anything people who are determined to not see and not learn
and to you know sit on the kingly throne of their the fact that they speak english and maybe can do
some math if they're lucky in terms of the rest of the world the hubris of that is unimaginable
you know there are fifth graders in pakistan that can out teach our calculus teachers in universities
um we are not as a people well educated and our and and so you can see how the english speaking
nests creates an inherent insecurity leads to an inherent insecurity insecurity because we speak
as if we are kings and queens and you'll hear um very confused humans on the internet saying
things about like this we are kings we are queens we are goddesses we are gods um it's not entirely
that they're wrong but that particular way of um holding on to it or broadcasting it
has nothing to do it's you're doing the opposite of what you're saying
