uh cognitive and relational and behavioral sovereignty isn't all it's cracked up to be
when it leads to isolation and you know the sorts of despair that lead to people to just
play video games or just drink themselves silly and watch you know streaming shows or whatever the
the lost
whatever the catastrophe of semi vampiric consumption is
and i'm not yelling at those people um the context we're living in is so it's it's literally like a
vacuum of 20 of the things that we need every day just to be human together or even by ourselves
and it doesn't mean we have to all be clumped together all the time either it means
we have to have meaningful roles relationships and dimensions of identity that we enact
together successfully for learning and mutual benefit that one thing that thing we need that
and some will say well i don't really and i'll say well i hope you're not working or anything
well i need money well why do you need money i mean the conversation quickly travels into
an exploration of um how we get set up to try to acquire an abstraction of relationships value
um nourishment healing love so forth
i was thinking earlier that it's very peculiar if i say for example in english and i'm sure this
is this part kind of this sort of weirdness is probably true in other languages if i say to you
you i'm not going to talk to you about leverage or succession
you can see that the speech act itself is doing the opposite of what it is saying
and this is a kind of this is a figure of speech this is one of the forms of vernacular
similarly if i say truly our next guest needs no introduction what do you suppose is coming after
that and so you would imagine that intelligent people would realize there's a problem with the
construct but it's become traditional to employ a flawed construct in this particular case in the
case of that specific figure of speech so it is possible
if i were to try to say to you you know i really really mean everything i'm saying
it's not very helpful but if i show you that i mean what i'm saying if i if my passion is
contagious if my curiosity is contagious there won't be any use in me saying things about meaning
things or not right if you place a delicious meal before people they will enjoy and consume it
if you keep talking about how good the meal is many of them will eventually depart
they won't even eat it and so this is another thing that english imports
uh you know arians braggadocio bragging peacocking which in case it isn't obvious
you know older peoples
they have some unique people you know language the language and people the people they have some
unique uh recollection that part of what their languages import is a tradition against certain
kinds of speech and moderns might say oh yes they're very superstitious about speaking no
even though there may be features of that that aren't there may be some threads of that throughout
the language what's actually in there is intelligence about
the unexpected consequences of inelegant speech or hubris in speaking or arrogance in speaking
think of how many people you know
who
who will think something resembling
if you really want something if you want something that's really difficult to obtain or
very precious don't speak about it or you can imagine some teenagers driving driving the car
downtown on a friday night it's all packed down there there's no no parking and they're trying
to find a parking space you know and they they almost get one you know something happens where
someone says something about like i think we're gonna get it i think we're gonna get a space and
they the other two freak out and say he jinxed us and then a few moments later a space that they
were next in line for is gets taken right and they think oh it was the speaking was a problem
there are many traditions about clumsy speech inelegant speech and by inelegant i mean crude
surely it should be obvious
that the way we relate with language has a structural
effect on our imagination our cognition um how we respond to ambiguity what causes or
relaxes vigilance in us all of these things so
you know i never realized before tonight many of the things that i have spoken around
particularly the whole kinglish thing
