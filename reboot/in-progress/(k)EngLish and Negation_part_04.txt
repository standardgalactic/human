and the irony and danger of speaking as if
one is the the pinnacle of authority
that the one from which all measurement comes right that is actually the kingly queenly
power it is to measure to meet out
this is the power that is given to judges in a sense in courtrooms which
is one of the weirdest caricatures of justice imaginable
though any reduction in humans torturing other humans makes me happy
but transforming it so that it's not physically vicious to the degree it is emotionally and
relationally vicious it's very strange and by the way you can see it should be obvious that uh
the solitude and individuality the namelessness in a prison experience is meant to be torture
of course they take many freedoms away
but it's funny because by doing that
that
they incline the prisoners to cooperation problem is the prisoners have been scripted
to form and obey
mostly malignant hierarchies
what are called cars in prison
you have to pick one when you go in and
it's the worst boy network
mostly
the people who are willing to act amorally and with violence run the system
it's an underworld inside our world and that's a world made by english
the payloads of other countries carry traditional ideas of
filial virtue, communal unity, mutual caretaking, respect for elders and children
and you know often there's some
problematical authority that comes along with it
respect for the provisional leader of the counterfeit country we grew up in
i think the goal of our country was to be was to resist counterfeiting in a sense
which is a very ironic mission to undertake
because in the same way i said
if i say i'm not going to speak to you tonight about leverage and succession
all right once i announce leverage and succession if i announce
we will work together to ensure that our country can't be counterfeited or stolen
by bad ideas people lethal games of language and concept we will
keep the light of human relational communal
and cognitive liberty alive together
you know four of the people signing the document are going to defect tomorrow
there is so much money to be made so much gold to be stolen so many lives to be converted
to misery for the sake of tokens numbers
and we inherited these near-term histories during our lifetimes while english changed around us
to reflect
the ever deeper counterfeiting
of virtue, verity and vigilance
and when i say virtue
i mean
the accessible origins of that principle as they exist in our own hearts
not some dictatorial list where we can check off the boxes
i mean the real stuff
and similarly a verity
a language that jump starts an amnesis
the capacity of a language
to deliver a payload that's incredibly profound and also largely
missing the pathogens
there must be languages
