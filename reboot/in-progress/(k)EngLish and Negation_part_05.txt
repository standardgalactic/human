there are branches of every language that carry
noble and heroic phalids there are branches
um
crucially
without being surrounded by a milieu
of rich creative literary philosophical and scientific diversity
and conversations and debate and exploration and celebration and literal heroism
how will we remember what it means to be human together
you know i'm not saying it can't happen to you at church or at school
or in the air force or the army
you're going to get something in there and i know what it'll be
but it'll be highly in service of counterfeit virtue
and straight up lying and straight up back stabbing back dealing
it almost doesn't even matter if there's a devil or not
because the humans sure act like there is one and there's a branch of us that's competing to

and once you involve warriors it seems you involve many dangers for counterfeiting

and it can do the same thing creatively technologically scientifically but it can do
it much better because if the recipients of advancements are trustworthy we can go a lot faster
together
also the problems our infrastructure societal infrastructure faces are monumental
and the existing
stuff
existing human electronic and physical infrastructure is delicate outdated
prone to fall apart on its own
if if we're lucky enough that nobody intentionally takes it down
so that stuff has to be remade our own government was supposed to be remade regularly
i think they thought
25 or more years per pulse something like this maybe
um
kinglish
yes it's weird there the connotative structure of english serves the conceptual proposition
of single persons
um which
that kind of inbreed the force of the inbreeding of comp of a competitive perspective
us and themism should be obvious there um
you better be able to table a lot of power as an individual if you want safety or
