individualness you can it's what are called business relationships another idea imported
along with the english we learn business relationships are not personal relationships
vice versa though of course at the at higher hierarchies that's for the low hierarchies for
the higher ones um they go together you you always have both or you often have both
so
you know if you joined a monastery
say you decided
you would study zen or
invite a vedanta or
suphism
you would begin a new way of relating with being human
in a contemplative way in these cases i think
but also a educational transformation unless
and most of the people i knew for example who studied zen had very large libraries
and some of them had taught themselves sanskrit others had taught themselves chinese
these are not easy tasks sanskrit's probably easier in some ways
god i hope the street goes somewhere useful i think it's going way too far away from my house
i've just i've gone for a much longer walk than i had planned so
there are branches of study you know if you read if you read through philosophy or if you
study mathematics you essentially what you're doing is you're recapitulating the history of
mathematical development in our species it's the same thing with philosophy the study of ancient
languages what you are doing is you're you're having a um intellectual an amnesis you see
unforgettable and this is very profound so this is what i mean by there are branches in our culture
if your parents are artists and complex thinkers and creative or they are writers or poets or
musicians or all three you will at least have a local example of a milieu in which discovery
exploration play rediscovery awe wonder enthusiasm um and perhaps ecstasy or even visions it's not
is these are common you know the garden has all the plants right you just don't grow up with uh
we we just grow beans around here son and we don't lack strangers that you find all over
the united states again though any community is a bit like the topology of english
there's going to be artists and creatives and intellectuals and secret agents you know hidden
throughout the terrain it'd be good if we had a signal whereby we could easily recognize one
another and authenticate our um identities that'd be fun or or even a way of signaling rather than
a signal right a way of signaling that would evolve good languages do this um i think kinglish
english weirdly is a slave language
and there have been attempts to fix the problem before esperanto might be one of them
um i don't know a lot about it
but we who speak it and write it and read it presuming we can uh much
would do well to understand some of the the threat landscape of what english imports into
thought semantics and expectation
and at the same time forge new ways of referring
and playing in that field
uh
that preserve our communality our common concerns interests identities and so forth
where the actual hell
and what ridiculous street is this
okay i get it kind of not it's not clarendon
and
i think i walked to another city accidentally this is so
yeah i walked away way far away
all right so if i say to you i'm not going to be speaking this evening to you about
succession or leverage then you can see that i'm doing the opposite of what i am saying
another very strange modern common vernacular
that is ironic is um something like
before saying something someone says to you i'm not going to lie you know i
