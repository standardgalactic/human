thought we were going to the football field right on as if
they're doing you the unusual favor of not lying
which is pretty strange
it's also become common and i sometimes do it
to make a statement and then congratulate myself or pretend that you're correct congratulating me
right and you don't even have to go all the way you can just go like right you can say part of it
right and people know you know what what's going on they know what time it is there's another
hello realism in english what time it is it's funny when i was talking about them earlier i
was trying to think of someone they just were not coming to my consciousness
so there is though a way of doing the opposite of that
so instead of doing the opposite of what i am claiming i am right now doing
i'm not going to talk i'm talking about right you know s and l l and s whatever
does this street go somewhere useful i am so fucking lost
okay i guess not i mean maybe who knows i can't fucking tell
there i am speaking ungracefully
oh my my my so
if you imagine a bubble of many bubbles and each of the bubbles are possible
choices or actions thoughts or ideas words etc so before i make a sentence i do have
the opportunity to imagine any any kind of sentence that is can be said
and to
there from traverse what we might think of as a series of choices selections negations
and so forth we could think of it that way probably isn't exactly that way
but i could think of these possibilities and then i form the actual sentence or
sequence of sentences that i have just spoken to you now so what i have done is i have told you
what i am doing while i am doing it i have done what i am saying it's the opposite of doing the
opposite of what i'm saying i will not speak of thus and such it's very difficult in english
to try to evade the problems that arise in negation i didn't do that it's already too much weirdness
it's very strange all of this this stuff
what the hell is going on there are street signs where there are no streets
where the flapping slot am i okay there's a street sign here for the sake of one house
or something i don't i don't know this is nuts oh i see okay i see
huh
this is probably where i want to go no i can't fucking know let's try it
so it is possible to do things that you are saying in english and there are certain kinds of speech
that actually allow you to accomplish a non-ordinary action by speaking very intelligently about the
potentials right about the uh where does this go i have no idea where the fuck i am i mean it
is so bizarre oh this is not where i want to go okay i'm just lost
there is a lot of detour around here
it's interesting to be lost but it's a little bit late at night for
for me okay so
you know language is a magical thing it becomes an everyday thing
many humans have discovered
that it's not necessarily that there are magic words quote unquote rather
it is that there are magical ways of relating words and consciousness
that produce very unusual and totally unexpected results
okay this is so funny i'm going to have to backtrack i basically almost did walk to another city
this is fucked
so
when you think about the difference
think about the difference in someone in someone's ability to see
into identity possibilities situations problems
in seven ways rather than three so the other night i was in a conversation
and someone asked me essentially what happened to cause the humans
to go insane and become
