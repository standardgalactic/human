you know bad to each other in the world at least at the group levels a lot and certainly in many
of our cohorts and i said well in the first story there was something that actually resembles evil
and we couldn't keep away from it it was a duke it was attractive we grabbed some we got it on
us and it got inside us in the second story we had intelligent parents and they went away
there was an accident or something and they went away and then in the space
where the intelligent beings had interacted directly with our minds
the shadow of their absence terrified us and you know we we acquired an inner shadow in its likeness
and in the third story
the onset of tool building causes a problem
in how we structure consciousness
it makes us susceptible to
what i call thrips which are sort of like
viral behavioral language something like that
um
in the fit in the next story
there are two primary colors red and blue
we once had wise relation with both of them something in the structure of our minds changed
we lost relation with them and the imbalance produced an absence in us
that could act as if it were a being
and we struggle with this now i could keep making stories or rather vignettes
but what i want you to understand is
we are trained to a very problematic form of consciousness that i call one thing mind
one thing that's just this one thing mind but what we really want to have is like five thing mind
five thing mind not that one thing mind kill yourself run into wall not good blinding
and english imports this one valued identification system and
we want to preserve that where it is useful
and surpass it in our use of the language so that we realize quickly it's not just this it's not
just that one valued thinking
unfortunately there are people out there they're like i wonder what those UFOs are well they're
not one thing they might not even be a category of of phenomena we have a placeholder for in
our lexicon right like what if what if they represent for example the category
okay what if they represent
this will take me
yeah
what if they represent the super category of identity meaning of whatness and who-ness
if they are the super category they are not what or who they are is being in relation
okay what you do what you don't do this changes who you are and who they are
and this is intelligent and this is actually how damn near everything actually is
you know joe most of the time amazing guy catch him on a bad day not a lot of fun to be around
threatened one of his children um the monster in joe will certainly come out
unless joe's like super wise in which case he he will liquidly
um transform and and both resolve the problem and not have to become a monster
so identity right now if there's a position above our categories we should be familiar with that
position that is where our mind should dwell this is a structural feature of our
very confused relationships with semantic qualities and positions like ordinarily
a single speech speakers we inhabit a position underneath the lexicon or at best co-equal with it
we should not only inhabit a position above the lexicon cognitively relationally in our awareness
of the peculiarities of speaking and thinking in words writing and so forth we should naturally
draw each other up above the lexicon and up above the semantics if anyone should begin
to fall down into that ancient peoples were quite good at this they knew the danger of
believing the language they knew the danger of falling beneath it and having it tell you
what you are who to be blah blah blah and this isn't just a patriarchy problem this is a problem
with the capacity to speak as an individual as if you're individual this comes with that mess
it's not merely patriarchy though you know patriarchy and the suffering of many other
