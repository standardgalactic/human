many what many clades many groups many persons
is certainly part and parcel of the payload of english okay is this the way i want to go this
looks like it might be although i really hope oh fuck where the flappity slot am i
and which way do i have to go
okay it looks like this way that's my thought
that says this is a dead end though
i sure hope i'm not going up that fucking mountain side that is not gonna work
that stairway is crazy insane we're talking about yeah that shit loopy
it would be like climbing up the side of a pyramid or something
so you can see that there's a position that is something like the un
the unformed potential
for
categories themselves in fact the the the word category
refers to that space right it's not a category it's the categories
and there's a position above that i think which is before the kinds of distinction
that would allow us to impose the concept of category
we want to be familiar with the places above language and remain aware
as we descend into those into the behaviors of speaking and writing and thought
so that
we retain a sort of what like a like those old divers lines right before they had tanks they
would lower guys in in suits with air hoses right we need to retain a link to the upscale
before of language and to the human the aspects of human intelligence above language
aspects of our own thought feeling no not knowing sensing perspective that are above
language and then travel down into it intelligently from above
then we will see many features that are otherwise invisible to us it gives us
it dimensionalizes the perspective in a in a variety of new ways and we when we tell
if we make a metaphor or something it's often better to make two or three rather than one
and we should avoid the construct it's just blah blah blah it's just this just that
except you know i'm not saying never we should never use such language but it's very deceptive
to the mind soon we think we know what everything is which is a huge problem because we don't really
know what anything is at all we have a bunch of tokens that we paint on familiar phenomena
that's it the name of the token doesn't tell you what that is it doesn't tell you much
in fact it's deceptively convenient right it reminds me of american culture deceptively
convenient hiding of a bitter isolation loneliness lack of communal
vast lack of communal organs
it is a profound liberty to be able to forge
complex cognition on you know within the manifold of our human experience
but it's also very dangerous it easily leads to unexpected and often invisible deprivations
and so there's a vast terrain of
um
impoverishments that many of us have suffered at the hands of the language we speak
it behooves us to gently and intelligently recompose ourselves
um beyond the confines to to help each other to recover the kinds of liberty in our thought
considerations learning and creativity that are natural to our people
but largely prohibited and counterfeited by our common cultures
this is my dream and i hope we will pursue it together
thanks for joining me my life for now
