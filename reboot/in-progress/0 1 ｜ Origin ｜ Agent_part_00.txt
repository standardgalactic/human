Hey everybody, thanks for joining me.
Before I begin to speak, I have to imagine.
I have to become concerned to translate potential into some inaction.
And I started out thinking about a paradox.
There's different ways to frame it.
And the language makes cuts in reality and possibility.
Both.
That we're trained to be unconscious of.
And because we can't see the language making the cuts, a paradox ensues.
For example, I could say this statement is false.
And notice it's the negation where the paradox ensues, because if I say this statement is true,
there's no terrible conflict there on the surface of things.
But if I say this statement is false, we have a problem.
The problem can be understood from many different perspectives,
and I think it's an extremely fruitful problem.
A beautiful, elegant toy of teaching, and maybe even awakening.
It wasn't opposed for the purpose of just stymying our minds.
At least I suspect it is very unlikely that that was its origin.
No.
There's a problem with certain peculiar forms of negation inside the context of assertion.
But there's a weirder problem.
Which is that this statement is true, is kind of trivial.
