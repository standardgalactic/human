We can agree or disagree without any significant rational consequence on the surface.
But even that cut, when looked at carefully, is very nuanced and bizarre.
It's just not as obvious as when we use the negative, so to speak.
We could talk about that different ways too.
But this statement is false poses an absolute paradox.
And the problem, as I've said many times, is that language doesn't tell us what it means.
We use language to mean things together.
So implicit in this statement is true is a meta statement.
And the meta statement is language tells minds what to be.
But actually the meta statement is just truth.
The statement is simply saying that the truthfulness of statements pervades over their content.
Which is backwards.
And is the kind of really weird, pure statement.
If we say this statement is true, it's much more obvious than if I use the false example.
The statement is just yelling truth here.
Inside this, which is a pretty strange thing for a simple statement to be doing inside human minds.
Of course the statement does nothing on the page.
Without minds it's meaningless.
So one of the things we can notice is that the statement collapses minds into statements.
No reasonable language would do.
Both statements, the statement is true and the statement is false.
Are twins in the sense that, but they're weird twins, the false one has extra dimensions of brokenness.
