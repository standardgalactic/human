And I was thinking about zero and one.
I was thinking about fundamental dichotomies yes and no.
Although yes is a by itself if you just say yes.
It's just kind of an app, you know, floating affirmation.
And if you just say no it's the same it's a floating negation.
Because without context the tokens don't inherit meaningful character.
All of our words are like this.
All of our languages like this.
It's almost like saying without equations numbers don't have any implicit meaning other than their order in a system.
So I was thinking about fundamental dichotomies and trying to wrap my mind in a new way around this similar problem of the set of all sets that contain themselves.
These are sort of philosophical issues in set theory and I'm sure they've been resolved and other people can speak to them vastly more insightfully than me.
On the one hand we have the set of all sets that include themselves and there's no apparent superficial paradox there.
But if we go to the negative of that set of all sets that don't include themselves as members now we have a problem.
And here's why. The superset has to include itself.
On the positive no standout terrifying issues that I can see maybe theorists have.
And I'd love to hear about them if so.
In fact I'd love to hear anything about this from anyone who knows something about it.
I'm just an amateur armchair adventurer trying to understand strange things.
But yeah the set of all sets that don't include themselves as members must include itself.
See the problem with that one recursion there?
So when we talk about sets that have a relationship with including themselves or not we can be, it's possible for us to be speaking about recursion.
And base recursion in math is deceptively simplistic in comparison to its origins in nature.
