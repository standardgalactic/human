Let me put it that way.
It's dimensionally kind of empty, right? It's pure function.
And there's no such recursion in nature. There's no recursion in nature that's pure function.
It's all, all of it involves relation.
So I mean recursion in nature and by the way in nature I mean in your mind, in your brain.
It can be influenced by functions and structured narratives and so on and so forth.
And it can become, it can build coherence in that domain of its possibility space, right?
Its potential space for development.
That's not the only place that recursion is going on in us by a long, long shot.
Or something that's even meta recursive in that it's, it's recursive over multiple fields of perspective in unique ways in each dimension of relationships,
even metabolic relationships, molecular relationships in the body, you name it, right?
So this whole recursion thing, which I've spent 30 years trying to understand more than the math about,
and the math to some small degree as well, it's a really important thing.
And the reason that these two statements that I started out with are different is because it is,
depending on where we're looking and why, we will see or we will bring forth to our consciousness a kind of fundamental dichotomy.
And that's, it's naive if we take that as like the basis of all things, but it's not naive to be informed by it, right?
So I want to be really careful about how I highlight my concerns here.
It isn't as if light is either a particle or a wave, no or yes or yes or no, depending on how we associate affirmation and negation, right?
Since the wave certainly negates the individuality of the particle in so much as we can understand it,
and the particle negates the universality of the wave.
They have a complementary relationship that we don't yet fully understand.
Granting theories I've heard nothing of that might give us insight, or little of, would be a better word.
