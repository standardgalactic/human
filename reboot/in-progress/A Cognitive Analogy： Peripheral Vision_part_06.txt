hints about possible threats or opportunities or situations that our
foveal vision is quite poor at recognizing or bringing to our attention often
when my eyes are half-litted in meditation I will see something very subtle
it may be the shadow of an insect or a flight path of an insect might be the
shadow of a bird and it stands out quite profoundly in my awareness because I'm
not using my foveal vision when my eyes are half-litted now this is a really
amazing topic and it goes very very deep if we want to follow it deeply for
today however I just want to introduce this distinction and to highlight the
fact that many of our most sensitive and delicate faculties are very easily
overwhelmed by conscious thought language speaking assertions and objections
the kind of courtroom of consciousness that we may often find ourselves in and
many of our finest faculties are too delicate to survive that harsh light
right that bright white LED like agony I hate those kinds of lights that much of
our waking consciousness is dominated by in order to get a sense of this rather
than just an intellectual sense which is not very useful by the way although the
idea is interesting in such it won't help us much unless we can embody it which
means we have to turn down the light of formal representational cognition
language what Zen people will refer to as the mind that discriminates the mind
