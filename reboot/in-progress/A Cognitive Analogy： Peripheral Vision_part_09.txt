just how things are all the time it's not some things being amputated the
subtleties and nuances of our intelligence our curiosity which is
fundamental to motivation and inspiration all of these things suffer an
ongoing sort of cascade of degradations as we undergo throughout our lives the
processes of in-languaging and in-culturation in our modern societies
and we see this problem shot all through what we think of as our societies
most of mostly I think of them as diseases masquerading as societies but
it's everywhere you look right it's like overwhelm them with noise dazzle them
give them the spectacle instead of the content give them the wrapper instead of
the food and this makes for good consumers and slaves which none of us I
think really want to be so bear in mind that most of the faculties that we would
that would really enrich our lives and hearts and relationships and minds are
not available to us when we're in the trance of you know thinking in concepts
and names and language and theories and models again those are useful but the
scope of their use is quite narrow when compared to the nearly universal scope
of the faculties they too easily overwhelm and hide from our experience and
inaction and embodiment thank you for joining me today I look forward to
learning together again very soon
