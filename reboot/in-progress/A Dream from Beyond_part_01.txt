more variables than just youth, right?
I've been listening to people's conversations, and seeing them on the street.
Can you hear?
Can you hear the morning though?
Let's see, where is that guy?
Pretty sure that's a guy.
Oh yeah, there it is.
Right about on that wire.
I'm used to hearing that morning dub there.
Now you can hear a little traffic, there's a little bit of foot traffic here.
It's not too, it's not too deserted.
It's funny how some people are responding more out of caution, some more out of fear,
some have a narrative, right, that they're playing in their brain like a map of the train.
In any case, dreaming.
It's nothing like this stuff, well, the relationship to consciousness is inverted, right?
This stuff here, this stuff is relatively continuous, relatively, like it's physically
disambiguated.
There's that unicycle, and a few other things.
So now I'm crossing the sort of major four-lane street near my house, and it looks like that,
that way, and that, that way.
I'm sure you've seen plenty of streets full of cars.
So the streaming thing, every once in a while, I managed to have an unexpectedly profound
experience, and this morning, well, I don't even know how to put it, each experience of
dreaming is unique.
It's at least as unique as it is, at least for me, amenable to being framed, right, to
being collected into this group of experiences we call dreaming.
So it has the general qualities of, well, even those are a little touchy to make a catalogue
of, but it seems trivial to say that every dream is an experience of dreaming, but it
is.
Most of those experiences have unique aspects, even if a dream is a mere repetition.
We are different each time we dream, so all dreaming is quite unique.
But in my experience, there are those dreams which stand out so far, so dramatically, above
the others, that they very nearly demand that we invent another class of experience.
