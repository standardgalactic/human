Their roots are in dreaming.
Of course, the essence is the waking day, our experience over time, successful or failed
attempts at physical interaction with physical things, right?
I get that.
I'm not dismissing it.
But dreaming is so profound I'm actually hesitant to say anything too specific about it.
The power of the ambiguity in dreaming.
The unique sophistication of its nuance.
This is astonishing.
And I think actually infinite.
It has no limit.
Will be limited is a similar thing to what is limited in the daytime.
Our felt senses and orientations in the dimension of identity, meaning, possibility, threats,
entities, so.
The last night I had a dream, well actually, I'm going to, let's see, it was probably sometimes
shortly before 10 a.m.
Today is May 22nd, the new moon.
And this morning, I had a dream that outclassed everything.
I only wish, got a spider web on me, I think, I only wish that my memory had been a little
more crisp and functional because this thing, it established a whole new class of dreams
by itself, right?
And it wasn't hypnagogia, and it wasn't hypnopompia, I don't think, although I don't know.
I'd been awake through most of the night, I fell asleep sometime nearing dawn, and I
had this dream where, I mean, it was really incredible.
It was so incredible that, like I said, it established an entirely other class of dream
experiences.
Now, I've had a couple of these this year, and one of them, I, in a way, they all deeply
involve new forms of life, right?
Interesting cube, right?
Yes, they all involve new forms of life or new ways of being human that I had never imagined
before as even conceivable.
And I've had some experience of this in my actual waking world existence, so I guess
it's not surprising that something resembling it might arise in my dreaming.
