waking world lives.
And you could argue with me and say, well, it's not before, it's after.
And I would say, maybe it's both, the before and after of our waking world minds.
So, yeah, in this dream, dimensions of activity and identity and meaning and all these things,
they were uniquely re-collapsed to expressions that were alive and that were alien, but they
were not like any kind of alien thing I've ever thought of or encountered at all.
And there were just the strangest features of being one of these multi-dimensional meta-organisms,
right?
I don't know what the fuck to call them.
I could make up a slippery word, right, in my normal waking consciousness if I'd done
so beforehand, and maybe I will later.
Yeah, the experience refreshed me because it was unlike anything that has ever happened
to me before.
I mean, it was a dream in the sense like this is something that happens while you're in
a para-visionary state.
And I think visions are a very distinct form of dreaming that are possible but relatively
uncommon, at least in my world.
If the departure of the sun comes ambiguity, the return of ambiguity, shadows and shapes
lose color and merge, that which was previously static might be seen to seethe or flow.
And so it is with consciousness and the mysteries of dreaming that will never fall before our
inquisition.
Never.
These vistas are infinite, and it's one of the things that keeps me fascinated by them.
And by you.
Oh, I forgot.
Oh, I forgot.
