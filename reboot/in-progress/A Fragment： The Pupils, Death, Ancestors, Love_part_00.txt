So I was just telling Chris that each of your pupils is surrounded by your enemies and your heroes
and people who are your friends and your helpers and the people who you're afraid of and that criticize you.
Kind of your right eye's, iris is sort of the people who criticize you are on top,
and the other ones on the bottom, they're kind of not too loud.
