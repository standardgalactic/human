so your film is basically it's based on the the most significant close encounter in modern history
is that right? I think it is definitely up there I would say that you know it's definitely very
you know what makes it interesting and valuable is somebody rolled camera back in 94 a lot of people
did to interview people and document what happened that I've never seen in any other case where
there's so much interview evidence you know. So when did you first become aware of this case
and how not only how long ago did you find out about it but also could you basically give
a rundown of what happened in Ruiz and Bobway in 1994? Yeah I'll give the rundown just so people
understand what this event it was in 1994 September 16th it was a Friday morning about 1030 in the
morning the incident was reported by you know a schoolyard of children and they had witnessed
this thing in the sky and then they saw it sit down behind their playground and watched it and
saw these little creatures come out and a lot of bizarre things they were witnessing that they
quite didn't quite understand that comes out through the interviews and then one of these
creatures approached them and there was some kind of communication attempt of some kind and
that's when all the kids there was a whole bunch of things that happened that
there was a sound that was heard that really spooked everybody at that point and they all
went running into the the staff meeting that was going on at the time at the school. That's
what kind of what spooked the kids you mean? Yes. The sound. Well according to several of the witnesses
yeah. What was that sound? How do they describe it? They described it like one of the interesting
descriptions is like a mechanical bee sound like a buzzing of bees. Yeah there were two
sounds that were really distinctly heard there was that this buzzing sound that you know people have
it's the same description but different you know different descriptions of the same thing and then
there's a high-pitched sound that happened that's separate from this other lower buzzing sound that
they heard. So that that's what was reported so when you know the BBC started to go you know
immediately to look at this the war reporter from the BBC Tim Leach. Oh he was a war reporter okay.
Yeah I didn't know that. Yeah yeah he covered all kinds of atrocities in Africa. Yeah he was
pretty he was already pretty scarred by the time he hit Ariel to be honest it's hard that's a hard
job man. So when did you first learn about it? 1995. Oh you learned about it the following year.
Yeah wow because I had seen the videos John Mack you know I was familiar with him and
I don't know if it was at an office or something I saw the first time I saw these kids and I'm like
and it was also on sightings that same year and I was sighting what's sightings? Sightings was
an old program about UFOs back in the 90s 80s and 90s. So yeah I that was the first time I saw it
and I was struck by it because I'm like what are those kids talking about? They're definitely
telling the truth about something and that's what it stuck in my mind so when the opportunity
came up in 2007 to do a movie about it I already knew what the material was not all of it actually
I was pretty surprised how much of the material there was not just from John Mack but other
people that have interviewed these kids. So and then there you know there was adults you know it
wasn't just children it was adults that witnessed this craft around the area a woman that lived
very close to the school, witnessed it in the morning, pilots would witness it the night before.
Really? Yeah. People don't know that. There were a bunch of sightings around Rua Zimbabwe leading up
up to a week leading up to that day right? Right. It goes back and it was on the news they were
put it on on the news. Yeah and you know the when you're doing a doc or you're investigating
you have to look at everything and you know one of the big things I looked at was what was going on
in space you know what was our what were the space programs doing and actually did FOIAs to
you know strategic air command did FOIAs to NASA. You did? Yeah. Oh yeah I spent quite a bit of
money on FOIAs because they were beyond the you know when you when you request a ton of data
they start charging you money. Right right. And what made you want to start doing these FOIAs?
Well because I you know when I was digging into what was going on in space at the time
you know and I heard about this Russian satellite that went up and a rocket body came in on that
Wednesday night and I thought oh that's interesting that's pretty important and you know I interviewed
a whole bunch of people that witnessed something on that Wednesday night at different times.
And it's you know very possible that that's what they some of those people saw was a rocket body
and then there's another group of people that I don't know what they saw you know. So that kind
of was a you know it was good to go down that avenue because that's all I knew at the time
and then I started to meet people that had seen it on the next night that were pilots
you know that witnessed it from the air and that was not involved in any meteorite activity
because I interviewed astronomers you know you know I wanted to do my due diligence on this whole
thing as far as what what really happened here you know. How long did it take how long did you
spend? How long did it take for you to conduct all these interviews and travel and do all this
work and this research for this movie? 15 years. 15 years you worked on this movie.
It's a long time. It's a long time. Yeah I mean you know the the investigative part of it I mean
it never stopped but the major part of it I went to Africa for a year and first first trip was
nine and a half months. That's when I first you know found the school with Nikki Carter
who's a journalist in Africa and she had interviewed the kids also way back in 94 and
and then you know found that I could find these kids. There's a woman named Robin Jured that deserves
a lot of credit for that because she helped me set up a Facebook right away. She's a woman in
Africa and she just donated her time and we started getting in touch with with these same
the kids that were at Ariel. So then the second trip was and then I started interviewing the
kids that first trip. The second trip I went. How old were they the first time you interviewed them?
Late 20s. Late 20s. Yeah because the kids that it happened to were between the ages of six and 13.
Right. Which is a pretty wide range you know. It's a good hundred kids anyway that went running
into that staff meeting. So yeah and the second trip was more you know traveling to England
different countries. Canada across the United States because most of the kids left because of
the political unrest in Zimbabwe. You know even in 2008 when I went I wasn't even supposed to be
in that country. There was a state you know there was a warning out by the State Department because
of the political violence that was going on and when I flew out of Zimbabwe the State Department
was on my plane. They were sitting right next to me. No way. And they wanted they actually said to
me they said hey if you learned anything could you come and talk to us because I was out in the
woods you know I was out on farmlands you know way out of the city. That's when the New York Times
reporter ended up in jail like for three months. I'm not even aware of this. What happened? He was
reporting on the political violence and he stayed in Harari in a hotel and they put him in jail
because they didn't want any western journalists covering this. So I had cameras. I'm out in a
shack in in Rua like an hour or so out of the city and praying that I can get out of the country
without them taking my tapes. That's how it was. Yeah. And knowing that people were being you know
brutally you know what happens is they go into a village and they you know they threaten people
and violence is committed. If you don't vote for the right person this is what's going to happen.
That's what that was going on. Wow. Yep. That was pretty heavy. So a lot of these kids at the time
you went you when you interviewed them in their 20s they were out of there they were in England.
Yeah they went to Australia, England, Germany they went all over the world you know. I gotta
say they were really smart kids I have to say that like they were educated really well and a mixed
diverse group you know. Yeah. Every color every religion was was really part of that school it's
pretty amazing actually. Was that sort of like a like a privileged school for people with money?
It was yeah it was started by farmers because they didn't want to they were sending their kids to
Harari that city to go to school so the farmers decided we want to build our own school so they
were you know white farmers predominantly and political families in Zimbabwe there was it was
a private school but they also they had to bring in the the the children from the villages locally
so it was kind of mixed very well right you had privileged people you had sort of middle class
people and you had very poor people um yeah but they did a beautiful job I I mean it's an amazing
school still to this day but you don't see the white population there anymore that's predominantly
Shona which is the local tribe in Zimbabwe. At what point during the process of making this thing did
you like if you spent 15 years on it there had to have been something that kept going because
usually people don't spend 15 years working on a project like this like what kept you going
through all obviously this was like self-funded. Yes well yeah it was initially self-funded
and fundraisers actually through the John Mack Institute in the beginning they were
helping me to you know they wanted me to do a 30 minute DVD of just John Mack's interviews
of the children and the more I looked into it I'm like you know what there's a bigger story here
you know um so yeah I started investing my my own money into it and then you know at one point
I'm like I think I understand the story right and then I kind of I was like it was maybe another
two years I'm like I got it okay I've really got the story here. Were you finding new evidence or
new people involved or yeah I mean the further I kept digging you know the more people I found
I got on the radio in Africa which was really great Nikki Carter helped me do that and
that brought a lot of people forward you know the pilots and people that were that never forgotten
what they'd seen a lot of the kids also a lot of other witnesses you know that contacted me from
those radio interviews so why did it take 15 years I mean it was you know the first seven or eight was
just investigative and then I it's like how do you tell it how do you tell the story and then
that was the difficult choice was make a standard UFO doc or you know the hard part was doing it
without narration you know and have the people say it talk about it themselves
you know what I mean yeah oh yeah that was so difficult that's the hardest movie I think you
can make as far as a doc because they have to say it right and they do and you have to have
so much material just to be able to right to have all that work you know yeah to string it together
and put a story together yeah that's the most difficult part um you said Tim Leach was the
BBC journalist who was he was the first one to report on this case right yes do you know what it
was the true him being a war reporter what made him want to chase this story he was our he just
got back from covering um I believe it was the atrocities that were going on in Zimbabwe they're
killing people and throwing them in mines because of the politics at the time so he was coming back
from that and he started hearing about these reports about the people seeing stuff in the sky
things in the sky that didn't make sense whatsoever and then so he was covering that and then
Ariel happened and he heard about that somebody called him one of the parents actually did
of the one of the children and he went and was the first one on the scene you know he called
a UFO researcher because he was said he was out of his ball game he had no idea what to do
he called Cynthia Hind and then Cynthia Hind recommended that he called Dr. John Mack because
he was you know prominent and he was researching this these type of events at that time
Dr. Mack was doing this you know seeing how widespread this phenomenon was outside of the
United States because for a long time people think oh I thought it was just a U.S. you know
phenomena right you know um and then he started traveling South America Africa and finding out
the same things are happening all over the place now did you sit down with Tim or did we see
what did you what sort of insight did you get from him by sitting down with him personally
he's he was so funny yeah he seems like kind of a weirdo oh definitely I mean he was just like
he used to photograph he used to be the the photographer for the Rolling Stones like his
history is really interesting so a movie should be done about that guy yeah like yeah I mean he's
he'd been shot he lost oh oh yeah yeah no he was he was for real um he just made me laugh all the
time did I spent about a week with him did this case get him into the whole UFO thing whole UFO
world subject whatever you want to call it yeah it did and it's you know cost him I really did
the cost him his job what that BBC yeah yeah how so because they well from Tim's words he's like
they don't want to you know they thought he was on wacky weed you know that's what he says himself
you know he's writing the editors of BBC like hey this is really happening down here and they were
they just didn't want to talk about it he the way he put it he's like you know there's certain
things you don't talk about and one of and he learned that in war like you don't show really
what happens in warfare he went on about you mean like as far as like violence and gore yeah okay
right like what we just saw you know in Ukraine that's what he's talking about we saw some video
recently like everybody did that was just horrific but that's the stuff they were holding back for a
long time that he was shooting but they'd never played on TV and he was always upset he's like
well how how do people don't even people don't understand what war really is unless you really
see how brutal and gruesome it is how are we going to sell it when people see how violent
deadly and devastating this is yeah so the UFO thing was he was a shock to him
he never stopped thinking about it he died in 2011 um it was probably within a year when I interviewed
him no way yeah yeah I really wish he got a chance to see this film and what year did John Mack die
again 2004 2004 so did you ever talk to him yes I didn't interview him but I did speak with him
what was that like he was brilliant he was kind of on another plane in a way kind of felt like he
was ahead of his time um yeah he was uh I mean the only person the only people that could really
talk with him about things are where people that really had a lot of clinical knowledge and experience
like he did yeah and that's a very few amount of people you know and they sure weren't all
but minded at that time they thought John Mack had lost his mind and you know they were pretty brutal
to him yeah it's weird to see how they were able to like we were talking about before we started
the podcast how they were successfully able to destroy his reputation because of this because
they didn't want to be quote-unquote associated with this sort of woo-woo topic that it would sort
of discredit the universities or discredit academia in some way it's just kind of silly
to be honest with you like I think if they like it's like what happened with Galileo and
Bernicus yeah you know how long did that take for them to actually be you know what they are
actually saying to be accepted it took like hundreds of years really for everybody to get on
board the Catholic Church apologized in 1992 for what they did to him yeah you know and that was
and I'm not nothing against the Catholic Church or any it's just that it was mindset like this
can't be real we're the center you know new information is too disturbing for us you know
one of the big things about science is you have to study material objects everything has to be
objective and we're studying the material world and we think about things in a certain way
and when you're studying something that has to change your whole frame of mind in the whole way
of solving problems then it's sort of just like intuitively counterproductive it's a counterproductive
to science in general with the way that the way that we study things and the way that we analyze
things the way he was doing it was more of on like a personal subjective way because he's sitting
down with these people who are quote unquote these abduction experiencers what what did he call them
he had a certain term he called them experiencers yeah yeah they were experiencers of this abduction
phenomenon or contact or any kind of like close encounter with these things yeah and for a guy a
Pulitzer Prize-winning Harvard psychiatrist having hundreds and thousands of people writing him
about these experiences he was having and having him sorting through thousands of these things
picking certain ones and sitting down and talking to this people talking to these people and trying
to get them to replay their experiences how do you analyze that because all you're doing is just
listening to somebody recall something in their brain there's nothing material you can't measure
anything well i mean there were scars stuff like that that was clinical you know what i mean like
something that could be photographed something that was repeated meaning like some of these people
claim that they were brought up into some sort of enclosed object and some sort of experiments
were done on them or like poking or prodding yep and there was a consistency between a lot of
these people with certain scars you're saying yeah that's true and i think he saw that i think other
investigators saw that but what the what john's claim was being a you know very well trained
psychiatrist having written books about you know
dreams and nightmares and addiction like he covered the whole spectrum depression like
suicide he wrote about everything and he had been seeing clients for 50 years or however many you
know so but his thing was like these people are behaving and telling their story like
people that have had a real experience it doesn't fit it didn't fit any of the classical
diagnosis is diagnoses for mental illness or you know at that time well actually it was before
that time they were saying that these people were schizophrenic that were seeing you know
having contact with some other weird species right and it went to you know false memory and
you know all these different diagnoses don't diagnoses well it's hard i mean
fuck what you i mean he was studying this stuff in the 80s in the 90s right so he started in 90
i think it was it was in the middle of the year 1990 okay so he started in 1990 publicly studying
well he he didn't necessarily he wasn't convinced at that point he just got exposed to
you know a group of people that were some a friend of his
introduced him to some he's like he's a heinig no that was actually hopkins bud hopkins oh bud
hopkins yeah yeah yeah and a female um fellow psychiatrist uh psychologist or psychiatrist
that brought him to bud i think that's what how it happened that was in 1990 and then he started
and who was bud hopkins for people who aren't familiar but hopkins um he started
he was an artist you know back in like with dakuni and he was the guy that
put speckles on um i forget his name sorry um yeah i'll pollock pollock yeah jackson pollock
jackson pollock so he was he grew up with those guys and like you know went to college with those
guys and he was one of those artists from that genre i mean he bud hopkins got has art at the
guggenheim all over he's all over the place um and he had seen something in 1964 himself
with his wife and uh he never forgot about it and then one of his neighbors had uh
reported something and he wrote a piece for the new york times uh editorial i think it was the
sunday i'm not sure what it was it was it was uh it was definitely in the in the new york times
but it got a lot of press and it got a lot of people calling him but he ended up writing a book
called missing time um that was uh about these events and that was i think in seven it was way
in the okay early days so he became a pretty well-known researcher you know of this phenomenon
um so him and him and uh john mack linked up and they started comparing stories no uh i think it
was this psychiatrist friend of john's that said you have to meet this guy and you have to meet his
the people he's hearing from and that's what john did he went down he thought they were going to be
crazy and you know he'll be able to easily diagnose them and that wasn't the case these were
like people that had jobs and careers weren't public you know um so i think that's what uh
i think his clinical he couldn't rule it out as he couldn't rule it to be something that was uh
uh easily definable in any way i think that's really what it comes down to like i try to like
put myself in his shoes back in that time in the 90s being a like i said Pulitzer prize winning
harvard psychiatrist and deciding i'm gonna jump into alien abductions and talk about this publicly
it's like it's almost knowingly career suicide because you know the stigma involving it just
look where we are fast forward to where we are right now if you want to if you want to start a
podcast or if you want to write books about just alien abductions people aren't going to take you
that seriously in general obviously a lot of people will but generally most people won't you're
going to get eye rolls from left right everywhere um but the funny thing is though you can talk about
the ufo topic now because the new york times is the pentagon is everyone's the navy fighter
pilots are seeing these things they're talking about it so the ufo subject is not really stigmatized
yeah but there's a huge leap between talking about ufos and talking about alien abductions
very true yeah and he you know he had and he's john mac said it himself about you know committing
professional suicide you know that's he knew what he was doing but he also knew
i think what he knew was just that you know it was the what do you do in that situation
he says that himself like what do you do when you see something you know it's not a medical
you know a mental diagnosis or you know a psychological diagnosis or anything else or
some other trauma that's reappearing you know that it is what it's being presented as what do you
do with that do you do you just not say anything how was he able to decipher
whether it was just sort of a constructed fabricated story or whether it was actually
relived trauma was there any sort of like distinction he was able to make to analyze that
yeah i think it you know over time he's i think it's just experience you see different behaviors
of different people that's what you're trained to do you know that's what he was trained to do
with children and adults to to to find out what the truth really was you know
you know
so yeah i don't and i think you know it's still here whatever this phenomenon is it
hasn't gone away it's never gone away it was here before john mac was here or anybody else was here
it was still going on it was being reported and we still don't have a clear answer about it
you know yeah well not people and nobody talks about nobody wants to talk about it
it's disturbing i mean really that's what it's disturbing the first interview i ever heard about
anything like this that kind of like made me like pause and take a deep breath was like was the um
travis walton story when i heard him explain that i was just like holy shit like i was like
my bullshit detectors were out and and ready to fucking pick up on anything but it seemed very
the way he described it and the way his stories stayed consistent really kind of
fucking blew me back in my seat and there were witnesses like travis there were five witnesses
i believe it was five other guys they've never changed their story they watched it happen
and you know i've talked with for i mean that man he he's another person who's really put himself
out there you know for i think reasons that don't benefit him you know in the long run
it hasn't benefited him to talk about this really you know and it's
i mean who's making millions of dollars in the ufo field you know what i mean like what's
history channel that's true okay that's different yeah that's true um but yeah that's it you know
there's a lot of people that uh feel like and i've run into so many you know just in the process
of doing this movie who you know they feel like it's just important that humanity knows that
there's something else out here did john mac ever meet with travis walton or interview him
or do a session with him do you know i'm not i i don't know for sure about travis i don't i don't
think so i just because of their their uh distance away from each other but it could have happened
yeah what was some of the biggest criticism or critiques of john mac with his with his
colleagues or with anybody like what was the biggest pushback against him and his credibility
because you said they were successfully able to destroy his credibility what i think they did that
in the press i was kind of childish in a way like they they uh just called them wacko macko and just
told you know they just there i think there were a lot of well the the people that were really
concerned were alumni that's how it really got raised and then also the school itself the dean
and we're talking harvard yes okay and you know john mac had submitted a uh
document for the new england journal of medicine a paper written about this what he was you know
working on saying this is not a mental illness and you know they did they would not publish it
they wouldn't publish it and it ends up that guy who was ahead of the new england journal of medicine
was the guy going after him from harvard like really within six months wow so that's pretty
interesting that uh those were connected and they just didn't want to talk about this at all
now when you were doing your documentary you fit you interviewed a lot of his
colleagues and as well as a lot of like the alumni from harvard correct yes what sort of
sense did you get from talking to those guys i mean i can't imagine they were did you talk to
anybody who thought talked negatively about that about him or was it all just sort of people who
loved him and supported him well a lot of the people that talked negatively were public so
i could get that data you know those interviews and stuff like that so i didn't really need to
it was all said pretty pretty openly uh through interviews or newspaper articles people really
but it you know what i it really looks like to me now and probably it's just people couldn't
even go there didn't want to go there and they were really disturbed that somebody in their
you know circles was going there to think way outside you know what was reasonable in their
minds you know it's like the whole oxen's razor thing you know whatever it's simplest explanation
is likely the one um which is usually true but maybe not so in this case you know yeah like some
of the other guys they were just happy floating in the shallow end and they didn't want to go
risk their lives and go into the deep end where john was working because it would be too dangerous
for them for their careers and it was just like what's you know i think john and trade off yeah i
think he had accomplished so much by that point he didn't care he didn't care on some level there
that's another thing too that you see a lot in academia is the people that come from these
universities who end up publishing works and getting lots of attention and media attention
there's a lot of jealousy with their colleagues and a lot of people try to like shoot them down
and talk negatively about them because they are in the spotlight and then you you have to question
like you see it all the time on on the internet nowadays people start talking about certain subjects
they realize they get a lot of attention and a lot of money from talking about certain subjects
or certain topics positively or negatively and they just sort of like fall down that rabbit hole
and they just they just keep chasing that and they just go in one direction so
that's like that's a legitimate question you could ask about john mac is that did he just
did he see this thing study it for a little bit realize he's getting a lot of attention
and just sort of lean into it because of hey i'm getting on opera you know i'm writing all
these books making all this money off these books everyone wants to interview me i'm a huge public
figure what's the point of what's the point of just brain just you know stopping this and doing
something else even if he's not super interested in it you know no i i just don't see that i mean i
don't think i think he was very moved by it you know um because he was you know interviewing people
you know all the time and talking with people about you know that what they had seen there were
witnesses to that so he talks to the witnesses it wasn't like yeah no i don't think he was ever into
it for he was already famous right he already had a huge following in a circle of friends at harvard
that's true this didn't help him with that right it didn't help him good point he took a real hit for
i mean that's why a lot of people respect him now it's because he he risked everything you know
what the question is whether he was right or wrong while we're still dealing with the same
thing it hasn't gone away those people are still talking about it there's more events that are being
publicly finally you know revealed um and i think you know what's the big deal it is a big deal
like if there's another species out there it is a big deal but what's the point in waiting you know
like i think our evolution if if we had known when it this first occurred when human beings
really first came across them and they had told everybody else we would not be in this position
we're in now what do you mean by that i just feel like that i think that the people weren't told
about this for a long time that there were there was another species out in this universe
yeah who knows who would know about it other than people who experienced it personally uh
because even if you are that person how can you i mean i would well it's not a person it's an
organization you know i mean there's plenty of people i can talk to you about the military and
they're what they've been pulling out for since 1941 anyway and it's a really so they didn't they
decided not to tell us the rest of us and you're saying that there's people in the military or
organizations that know about and are familiar with these abduction phenomena can they take it
seriously well it's it doesn't even matter what the event is whether it's a contact event or citing
in my opinion like it's the fact that there are there's another species out there period
so i mean that's a big deal and there's government and there's military agencies that
that know for a fact this is true yeah that's been that's been that's i'm not saying anything new
i mean pentagon's talking about it they're looking at all the old records and the you know
blue book you know project garage project sign before that roswell 1941 Missouri
i mean there's a roswell roswell has been debunked pretty much right no no not at all
i thought that had pretty much been i thought i thought it was basically when i say debunked
what i mean is like jfk's assassination everybody knows that there was some foul play involved
and that the cia if you really dig into jfk people know that the cia was somewhat involved
in that if you look at the fucking if you follow the evidence right so if you look at roswell and
you follow the evidence you follow the history the interviews of the guys that were there there's
obviously a cover-up with roswell that's what i meant by saying debunked like i don't mean like
that the balloon story is real i mean the balloon story has been debunked right that's what okay yeah
yeah i mean i i actually went and talked to some of the people that live around there
you know long this was back a long time ago and because i was curious like i'll hear about something
but i want to go there and talk to the people that live there you know like with the phoenix
lights i went to the police station and talked to the police and said what happened with this
what do you think and they were like yeah no this really happened i don't know what it was but it was
huge you know that's what they said so i think decisions were made by people that
we shouldn't know about this the rest of us shouldn't know about this and i can understand
how they would have made that decision i just think it was a really bad decision because it
changed our evolutionary path how do you think they made that decision because they were concerned
on how everybody would react how do you think people would react i think they're gonna be pretty
freaked out for a while yeah but what would be the consequences of being freaked out like so
how would that affect society do you think how do you think it would affect i think it governments
event that's the problem right i think that's the problem is who's you know the churches have
been in charge now and then it's sort of transitioned into science um john mack talked about this a
lot of other people talked about this uh this is nothing new i'm talking about it's um but it's uh
who's who's really gonna be in if we if it's revealed that there's another species out there
that's way more evolved than us that we can't catch up to you know who's in control then
you know who's gonna get that respect of power i think that's
that's a really good question tough question to to think about i think overall it's probably
best for us because we're gonna get you know we're not gonna i think we'll end up pulling together
as one planet because we know there's something else there that's not us as human beings i think
that's likely gonna be the end result but it's gonna people are gonna be in shock for a while
for sure a lot of people explain these abductions as if like they're advanced
beings from another planet or another star system but there's also a group of these abductees
who claim that this is has some sort of religious context to it some sort of spiritual or religious
context as if these are like these are like angels right i mean it's pretty interesting
to look at you know yeah the bible i used to you know i read the bible twice through
and i always flip through it and uh when you think about this whole topic and then look
back at the bible that's pretty interesting like what would they see you know how are they
interpreting what they were seeing right because they didn't have the tech we have and the understanding
right exactly when john mac talked to the children from ruiz and bob way what was his
i'm sure this is part of what you talked to him about like what was his initial reaction
to to talk to these children and had he spoken to children in the past yes that have had similar
experiences he had yep um i think it was just it was more it was confirmative for him that you
know it was just the same description the same emotional impact all of the stories were so similar
but they weren't exactly the same which kind of like that kind of hashes out the idea that they
were just trying to prank the school teachers yeah because a lot of them had different perceptions
of what was going on or one girl claimed that when she looked into the big eyes that she was
getting thoughts of technology being bad and when the other girl looked into the eyes the
thing she got this whole thing about the environment it seemed like they had two different narratives
or two different experiences the physical experience was the same what they saw was the same
but what they thought about was different when they looked at these things i thought that was
pretty interesting yeah yeah it was subjective you know like everybody depending on where the
person was what their perspective was it was very you know from whatever perspective they had
i think that you know the technology thing that was said to one you know however that was done
i mean i love the way she says it like it came into my conscience you know yeah
how she didn't know anything about the word telepathy or anything like that but she was
that's what she was describing in a sense um but they were talking about the same thing
in a way like it wasn't like you know one was about or several were about what was going to
happen to us if we keep going down this path and the technology thing was this is why like your
that's what i i see is like yeah our technology we've grown really fast and and
done amazing things but we don't have the responsibility to you know yeah the the
interesting thing about it is when it took place in the 90s was like cold war or developing nuclear
arsenals all over the country all over the world testing nukes and there's a lot of like there's
a book a great book written about this called UFOs and nukes which talks about the basically the
generals who were in charge of these warheads these intercontinental ballistic warheads
that saw and reported flying saucers coming up shooting beams down into the the missile silos
i think there was another famous case in europe or england somewhere where there was like a
the u.s.'s biggest stronghold of nuclear weapons that was housed in europe
randalsham what was it called randalsham forest okay yeah yep mm-hmm where a bunch of the officers
as well as a i think it was a um one of the guys who sits in like the air traffic control tower
said he saw this thing and they explained how it just basically moved like a laser pointer in the
sky it makes me think immediately like about how we handle herds of animals in the wilder you know
conservator you know conservatism or conservatories right nature conserved conservation yeah
conservation and how we you know we keep the population down because they're gonna get out
of hand overpopulate and they're gonna end up dying of disease so we call them you know and we've
learned a lot about culling what not to do yeah like in africa they used to call the elephants
and they'd kill all the old ones right so what would happen was the younger ones had no wisdom no
teachers and they'd go in and trample villages so now when they call elephants they don't take
out all the old ones they they they go and call elephants yeah i thought elephants were severely
underpopulated like almost on the verge of extinction not not i mean they're getting there
that's for sure because of the poaching in africa that's that's mainly yeah that's that's true it's
mainly the rhino that's really and the rhino too yeah the rhinos i think way worse off than the elephant
but the i think they're both really bad everything is even lions are on the list now i mean it's
really sad what's happening you know we're just friends that are in you know paleontology that
i know it's like dude we're in the sixth extension extinction event we're in it it's already happening
we're losing species left and right yeah that's not a good thing how many events are there like
this rua case where somebody saw some sort of being like come out of the craft and kind of
communicate with them adults or children or anything oh there's tons yeah there's a lot there's a lot
but not many where there's like lots of witnesses who corroborate each other right
less so yeah you have a there's that less so mass sightings they call them um where you have multiple
you know over 10 or 15 witnesses even that's a lot there's plenty of incidents where there's
two or three people um they're like the travis walton case yep i mean i even travis that's
five people other than himself um that's a unique that was a unique event um
but yes other schools yeah i part of the deep dive on ariel was where else has this happened
so one of the places was wales a place called broad haven in wales where 1976 or 77 i believe
77 these children reported seeing this craft out behind their school and uh so i went there
went to wales talked to the people you know nobody wanted to go on camera because they had
already been on camera and already had all this ridicule and you know now they were in their 40
mid 40s early 50s and they were just like what's the point nobody's going to believe us anyway
that's what they said to me and i talked to the headmaster and also retrieved all their drawings
that they drew that they drew when they were kids oh wow yep and it was a primary school
it was kind of odd because i'm driving there and what does that mean primary school primary school
is like you know from i mean for me it was like from first grade to sixth grade okay you know okay
just not used to that terminology yeah that's elementary school okay so it means like what
under 12 years old basically okay before before junior high okay yeah um so there was one in russia
there's one i was aware of in chili where actually there's video of like recordings of the witnesses
oh children either they're speaking spanish but it's still like ariel was the what's interesting
about ariel was so documented that's what makes it unique yeah if those people didn't record
those interviews at that time and there was six different right organizations people that did that
it wouldn't be we wouldn't be talking about you know it was those people and and you know it was
amazing as every single one of those person had kept everything after all that time they're like
this whatever happened here is important and they kept their notes kept their videos why do you think
they were so open about it compared to everyone else what was what was with that what was with the
openness i think it was the kids i think kids in every other case and lots of other cases too
where they where they didn't talk about it why did those kids specifically why were they so open
the kids themselves or the kids or the people around them just in that event like like you just
said there's no other event where the kids were so where they were so open and as far as doing
drawings having conversations recording about it everyone else just kind of like shut up
and didn't talk about it like you said what's the point but these people in rua these kids
in rua for some reason they were just whether it be the people they were surrounded with or
whether it was john mac but they it seems like just they were they were more encouraged to
be open about it no i think i mean in wales they were open about it okay um it's just
you know for whatever reason and i think it was the quality of the kids to be honest with you
and that some of the kids
i'm not that's the wrong word um i think the kids affected people the kids that spoke about it at
ariel really affected people because they were you you knew they were not lying yeah everybody
tells you that you know i haven't met anybody that says yeah no those kids were lying doesn't
matter what they saw right they could have seen anything right do you know what i mean like
they were whatever they they were telling the truth you can argue about what they saw but
you can't argue with the fact that that everything about them their body language their eye movements
i had you know i had people look at that specifically like are these people telling the
truth body language eye movements hand movements right is there any deception here
mm-hmm there's a whole paper being written right now about that uh that's really that's
going to be interesting who's writing it i can't tell you that come on man i can't not not not
not yet sneak peek it i can't tell you that because but it you'll it's going to be pretty amazing um
just because it's just so professional you know it's it's uh do you have any idea when it will be
out i don't okay but i um i've seen some of the drafts and i'm like yeah thank you for looking at
this really like i saw it but it's great to have professionals who do this all the time
you know have their expertise and and hear what their comments are and get a peer reviewed and
all that so that's yeah um but people have come forward um
um you know that i guess the hard part is we just nobody we really don't take this
serious we don't know what to do with it the hard part the hardest thing about it is it's like the
the agent involved in this phenomena is almost just like poking us and toying with us
and deliberately staying on deliberately giving us just enough evidence for people
who are willing to believe it but not enough for the skeptic right
and it seems like i don't know what how could you have any evidence like other than somebody
having some scars and saying hey look my scar is similar to his scar and he has the same story
or i mean how do you how do you come up with how do you get past that barrier
for people to take it seriously how do people eventually come to take this seriously
i think we have to see that i think that there's there's some efforts and some movements
if you want to call it that about stuff that we've retrieved
like metal some some yeah i mean i don't know if you've heard about it people have been discussing
it yeah i know i know like uh joc valet has been studying some of this these materials and gary
nolan yep and there's a whole big thing about these crash retrievals you know globally that's
going to be interesting you know like what did they have but when and they didn't of course they're
not going to share it with us because a it's a national security thing they don't want any other
country to have any piece of this but it's also like you know anything that shows life outside
this planet is going to change everything whether it's a you know a piece of you know
meteorite from mars you know that comes in that has a little micro minute they've been very cautious
even about that they don't want to open that door um because it's such a big deal we i mean we have
an example of that with you know when i was talking about Galileo and and um that whole thing
you know we're people's consciousness changing to say we're not the center you know we're not the
center of it all and this is another step john mack talked about a lot of other people who talked
about it like this next step that we're gonna likely have to take whether we like it or not is
that we're not the top dogs something else is that's hard i don't think it's that hard for
most people i think it's harder for people in power right yeah like i think i think most
people like the majority of the population i don't think would be that devastating for them
yeah only yeah you think but you know when it comes to people like people in control of
governments that want to control the population and paint a certain narrative to for whatever it
may be for money or power it may not be the best for them but then you know you got people at the
top even the fucking president doesn't know about this you have a new president every four to eight
years there's no way they're telling the president everything yeah
you know and then you said so you said you did a bunch of foyer requests
who who did you send these foyers to and then like what sort of revelations did you come to
after reading through these and what did you discover because one of the big things about
foyer requests is you can't you can't do that to lockheed or Boeing you can't send a little
foyer request to a private aerospace company that's correct even the shuttle like has tons of private
you know i couldn't can't send one to SpaceX can you um well i i was very specifically targeting
certain things that were going on at the time but i was also i was told by nasa and i was told
about you know not it wasn't strategic air command they were interestingly when i requested the
information about the rocket body on that Wednesday night that's the only thing they
didn't give me any information on her data the rocket body yeah yeah what was the thing that
sent up that russian satellite from balkanar yeah so anyway they but it was just interesting like
the very thing that i really wanted to know about they didn't give me any information about and i
called them i said why didn't you give me that's what i'm interested in that was a very interesting
and and the answer was it was already public i'm almost like okay but why you know you didn't
track it why didn't you track it i mean they tracked everything else um anyway um
but yes on a lot of these missions they're private there's private experiments private
space things that you even when you foya like you're saying you can't get that because that
does not belong to nasa doesn't belong it belongs to this private company right um so you can't get
the info so you know what it does make you wonder what's what else is going on and out there and
that's how you keep it quiet is keeping it private do you think that all governments of all countries
are keeping it as private and locked away as we are in the us or are there other countries that
are more open about this oh yeah there's a lot everybody's more open than we are every country
that i've talked to in the militaries of other countries or you know anybody in politics they're
like it's you guys what do they say about what do they say about the whole phenomenon that we're
the key to it that we know we know we know we know we know the most our country knows the most out of
any country on this planet about it huh and interestingly we're not we're the least we have
the most uh what do you call it ridicule and disbelief in this country other people other
countries are much more open about it yeah that's weird it is i when i heard it i'm you know there
i was in south africa talking to on an air force base talking to the commander with a lieutenant
colonel and he says what are you doing here the answer is in your country why bother why are you
here and he told me quite a few things and i was just like my mind just got blown first of all he
was talking to me about it openly about this phenomenon being very real and they see it on
who was this guy he was a commander in air force base an air force commander yep he was commander
of the whole base oh wow with a lieutenant colonel who was a female what sort of things
was she saying he was saying and she supported him about what they see on radar okay anything with
the naked eye or just mainly radar i mean they're you know they were referring only to radar at that
point but they said that we can tell what these things are actually i gotta tell you this because
it blew my mind they're like you know when i heard this i was like what they're like
we can tell the difference between the american version and the russian version and the real thing
really and i'm like what are you guys talking about the american version the russian version and
the real thing meaning there's technology that we have and that they have and there's technology
that someone else controls and you can easily tell the difference really these are military guys like
straight laced him and her i mean i couldn't believe they were so open with me do you think that
tic tac stuff and that stuff off the east coast you think that's military or do you think that's
no what do you think it is i have no idea i think it's anything that we have no i don't
i'm we're good we're the best on the planet but this is you know the guys that witnesses the pilots
you know a lot of these guys they're dealing with a lot of our latest stuff i mean they you know
they're uh i mean they're some of the best in the world and they know where the cutting edges
or at least they they have an inside scoop i would say they people yeah so not that they know everything
that's on the cutting edge or anything but they they would know whether we're even capable of this
stuff and why i mean that's not what you do when you develop new technologies you don't show it like
that right and they and another interesting thing that um one ryan graves brought up to me the other
day when he was in here is the first time commander favor saw the tic tac was in i'm gonna
fucking forget the date i want to say it was like 2008 2009 something like that can you find
out the date of the tic tac thing 2004 2004 okay so way before that and then the other ones like
the go fast video in the gimbal video were you know the years that those were those were like
10 years after 2015 so if we had that technology why would we be testing it for that long of a period
of time and it's the same thing people were reporting in the 40s right and it's they're
testing it in like the busiest airspace in the united states so if if the united states air force
or the military or any of these crazy dark you know government organizations that we have were
testing the shit they wouldn't be testing it there and they wouldn't be testing it for a 10
year period right i mean they do test things for long periods of time for sure but this has been
going on for so long and it it's the same it's the same thing it's the same type of behavior
the same type of warping physics as we know it in a way and time just bizarre stuff that
we're we're just beginning to like kind of get a grasp on like oh this is possible in my you know
that's my opinion um yeah yeah i i gotta say i'm really i just for those guys to speak out
was a really big deal yeah you know i have to salute those people because you know they're
again those are more people putting their butts on the line and why would they do that there's no
upside for them right yeah yeah well it's definitely a safety issue that was one of the
concerns of ryan graves because he was he was you know in charge of safety on his ship and
when he he almost got fired and he almost got went to jail for doing that because he was still
active military i don't think commander fravor he was already retired when he talked about it yeah
but ryan graves was still active and i remember that they he said that they brought him to the
pentagon and they sat him down with a bunch of people and they were grilling him for a while
um in an attempt to you know not only get information from him but intimidate him right
so that's scary man are there still sit like phenomenal like what happened in rua like
sightings like this and abduction of stories coming out today because really like the the
landscape we live in is far different from what it was during that time in the 90s it is yeah um
i mean i keep an ear to the ground on that stuff but it's
you know i'm it's nothing i'm personally investigating at all it's just what i'm
hearing other people their work some stuff going on in that some pretty incredible events in canada
i mean i don't think anything's really changed i think what's happened is
is and i think this is a good thing that there's organizations like there's people actually trying
to help these people um by taking their stories and that's it you know just recording them taking
them seriously and the fact that the people that have seen these things they have a really hard
time it's not like you know you see one of these things and you get on with your life and nothing
happens you you go through i mean i saw it with the aerial kids and other cases like it's really
difficult because it blows your sense of reality out of the water and all of a sudden you have to
look at your world and like whoa what either i'm crazy or i did see that and if i did see that then
that means the world is not what i thought it was you know what i mean like yeah there's this whole
other aspect that nobody's told me about or told us about it's almost like they got lucky because
they have at least they have each other that all saw the same thing if you're a one person that
had this crazy experience and you don't know who to talk to that's tough that's got to be traumatizing
that's got to be relive that yeah yeah no i think in a way they are lucky and interestingly though
they really rarely ever talk about it with each other which i found with other people that it had
encounters like they it was so disturbing to them individually that they didn't want to communicate
about it with each other even though they both were there or three of them or four of them were
there at the same time it happened but it was so disturbing to all of them that they don't want
they'll they'll talk about it for like maybe 30 seconds and then just move on because they don't
want to sit with it because it's that disturbing um but i think you know that's it's an that was
kind of an older generation of people it's kind of interesting to see the younger crowd of people
growing up and just they grew up with that idea in their head you know or the movies that were out
and stuff like that they're more open-minded you know what was i know i know mack john mack didn't
finish get to get to finish or come up with any sort of conclusion to his study of this
but what were his ideas as to why these were why these things were happening and what were some
of like the most common threads throughout these experiences people were having
i know one of them was some sort of like he talks about some sort of um
breeding program or some sort of like where they were these beings were sort of like doing
some sort of sexual reproduction reproductive experiment with people i he talked about that
in his passport to the cosmos book in the beginning yeah but he said that that was like
a common thread was that a lot of the experiencers had this same thing this same thing that they
would talk about when he put them into this sort of like meditative state and talk to them
right well he had it with people that didn't even go into that i mean people just reported that it
was consistent and you know it's just it was more on the level of scientific exploration
do you know what i mean like like we do we go out it's the same kind of thing i i see it as
we do all kinds of things to other species on this planet i mean some horrible things yes
and we i love that somebody told me that an analogy of like you know we
some people like we spend what billions of dollars on our dogs here and in other countries
they eat them yeah right how funny is that yeah it's true yeah so i just i know it all sounds
weird but if you step away from it and look at it from like oh it's just another species looking at
us as another species that is or not maybe that as smart as we think they may be doing a lot of
things i think there really is something to the term ultra terrestrial that compared to extra
terrestrial meaning from what i understand is just not from this earth ultra terrestrial
meaning not from this dimension meaning their inner dimensional beings that can choose when
they want to be when they want to step into our reality and when they don't when they want to
remain in other dimensions i found that kind of fast i'd never heard about that talked about
other than alex jones until i read john max book yeah i i think it's uh i mean people like oh maybe
they're us traveling in time backwards and yeah time the time traveling yeah there's all kinds
of different theories to me it's like it doesn't matter it's just it's something else more intelligent
than us more evolved than us that's what matters doesn't matter really where they come from it's
that they come from outside of us so i i kind of don't get up into those um i hear them and i think
about those ideas but i i just think well it's just it's something from the outside that's uh
that's the thing i always come back to is it something that's from the outside coming in
that's more intelligent than us that's a new thing what so this these kids they're now in their 30s
from zimbabwe do they all have the same sort of feeling like what is the vibe in the room with them
on this up when you start to ask them about this like what is the 30 000 mile up overview or
takeaway from the whole experience for them what do they think it meant what what did it mean to them
uh it's very it depends on where i think where the person is in the process of dealing with it
you know what i mean like there's certain people that don't want to even think about it still
they just go on they just live their lives and keep their head down and go to work right and uh
uh there's others who i think have a really good grasp and have some just profound thoughts
about what it meant you know how anything that sticks out to you uh yeah a few people
that stick out to me and and things they've said in in the interviews and
which to me revealed like wow this person has really thought about this and the the implications
of it the bigger picture of it how they were involved i guess you know when you asked me about
like what was in the room like everybody i interviewed about this there was like a it
was a deep feeling in the room like it wasn't this wasn't a light thing to for any of those
people to talk about i had to build trust you know there's a lot of they were afraid i'm sure
i know this that i was going to make a fool out of them or you know they were very concerned about
that but there was a very deep with every single person i interviewed like i could feel it like
this was no small deal for them that's i do know that um and i it's weird as a filmmaker you feel
like god i'm sorry i exposed you you know sorry sorry i brought this up again in your life because
i know it's not a small thing yeah you know like i'm sorry i had to make you think about this
but i think it's important for the rest of us um is it is the experience or their memory of the
experience like religious at all to them awesome but it's not in the positive it's more in the
negative like this was the devil or you know interestingly yeah maybe it doesn't maybe it's
not the case for them but like in any of the people that you've interviewed did it sort of like
give them or sort of like change the trajectory of their lives or is it more so like what you
just explained they kind of just keep their heads down and forget about it and keep going about their
work no i think it changed a lot of people's lives i interviewed the parents of a lot of the kids and
asked them what changed with their children when this happened and one dad had twin kids that
were went to aerial and he said like you know anything was possible after that and so they
moved his kids moved to america went to college like and they were from they were native shona
from the village you know so it and that i've heard that from other parents other parents of
kids like that they um this experience taught them that anything is possible and that was like the
biggest thing that that i found and not all of them took that you know some people were very
disturbed by it some people took it in a religious manner depending on their upbringing their parents
everything it's really complicated actually the interpretation of it like whatever you know
whatever this these things are and this other species is whatever it is that's one thing and
then there's the whole how the human being interprets it with their belief systems and their
ideas right then that's when it gets that's kind of actually been hard because i've been trying to
figure that out i was like okay this is what everybody reports and then this is this other
part that this is their interpretation of it right like even the messages i think well
how did that come about you know like the the the messages that they got you know from these
creatures is that you know i'm not saying this is true i just wondered like well maybe when a human
being goes into this kind of event where they're confronted with another species that's more intelligent
than them do they start to think about their own environment their own cage you know what i mean
like i just wondered that you know like wow um just as a yeah how does that change your mind
like how does that change change the framework of your way of thinking when something like the
concept as simple as i'm not the most intelligent thing here yeah that's a great question because
we've never dealt with it that's interesting we're still wild and we you know this is
told people this i think i'm probably crazy but it's like we're still wild animals we've never
been tamed by another species right and we don't think we're wild animals
or have we been tamed by another species and we're not aware of it that's a just that's a
disturbing thought but yeah maybe very possible right very that's the problem with a more like us
with animals like we're tricky you know i can make light come out of my hands you know with a flashlight
and animals are pretty like what the hell you know it's books them um because it's like magic
like ants ants don't see us we're so giant we're so big we can do whatever we want we could
we could fucking build a city around an ant pile and they would never see it all they're doing is
just fucking building their colony and serving the queen and and doing their they're keeping their
heads down and they're going to work like they don't see us look what doesn't matter what we do
it's not gonna change they're not thinking about it like they're completely unaware of us doing
anything you know what i mean like maybe it's the same thing with us maybe that there's that big
of a gap between us and the next most intelligent creatures out there yeah i mean i used to do
a lot of photography of ants and and hills and i would be i'd have my foot this far above their
ant hill i'm gonna go like this they just carrying on but when you start to pick a few of them out
like take a few of the ants they start somehow that word gets out and they start to panic
really yeah yeah yeah i did my insect research for quite macro macro lenses that was actually
interesting for years insects but um yeah it's i guess we don't think about like i guess human
beings have a really hard time i know i had for a long time and still do because i sometimes i just
don't when i think about it is like just pulling back and seeing the wider picture of you know how
what we are i mean we live on a very small planet it's 8 000 miles across 24 000 miles in
circumference and then we only live in a space of three miles where we can breathe
that's a very small cage we actually live in but it's big enough for us not to realize it's a cage
right right you know and we've broken out in the last what 70 years since the space program
we broke through that i mean that's a kind of a weird way to look at it but if i was another
species from the outside looking in i'd say i don't even need to pay attention to these guys
they're moving out into the bigger space
hmm yeah that's interesting you know it's really it's like going back to
like what we see and what we don't see it's just so weird how we have come so far and we've
advanced so far technologically but we don't see anything else you would imagine if the
if the universe was full of life and there was another civilization as advanced as we are we
would see something with all these expanding civilizations have you heard of uh robin hansen
he talks about these things this concept called grabby aliens he wrote a he wrote a paper called
the great filter i think it was a book or it's a paper he wrote called the great filter and um
i'm gonna try my best to explain this but it's gonna be butchered um but he basically explains um
um the lifespan of a star and i believe it's like four or five trillion years and how long it takes
for bacteria to become advanced life and there's six basic filters or stages life has to pass
through to become intelligent and very rarely does it make it past the sixth filter and we have
and he uh he uses the metaphor of cancer right so like in our bodies we have all these cells and
a cell has to go through six specific stages to become a cancer cell and typically cancer
cells only evolve in human beings later in life so only after i think it's like
80 or however many billion years this planet has been around what is it like
4.6 4.6 billion years so his whole concept is that 4.6 billion years is nothing nothing
in the span of the lifetime of a star which is five trillion years so he's basically saying we've
come become advanced so fucking early it makes sense that like it's it only makes sense that
there has to be other civilizations out there yeah you know what you were saying about like
us not seeing these things like that's kind of what changed the navy's thing they upgraded their
radar that was a big deal like i think we were forced to do that because we had to keep up with
china and what was going on globally but that's what happened we upgraded our radar we started
seeing them right very clearly it's like oh and then there's another effect where
you know people don't notice things until you point them out you know like a lot of times if
people won't notice details about things until you bring it up right like see that dew on the
grass that i see you know whatever and they won't even be looking or never notice it until they
after you say it yes and then they start paying attention yep oh you know yeah that's an interesting
phenomenon too like perception perception you know like when you when you buy a new car you're
starting to look for a new car and you look at this car you like you want to get this all of a
sudden you see them everywhere true that's perfect that's a perfect example yeah perfect it's real
right yeah it is so that's you know how much do we see and we're evolving our sensor technology
like crazy and geez it's an exciting time to be honest you know we're learning a lot and wow
but this whole topic just mind blowing have you had a lot of people people reach out to you
since you released yeah your movie i i had to stop answering my email because within like two months
i had 100 000 you know 150 yeah i was no it's 53 000 emails um you know not all of it was
people reaching out by any means but i was just overwhelmed you know and phone calls and texts
and the most important ones were you know people saying thank you for validating my experience
that was i mean you can get no better letter than that or better note or better email than that
because you know they're people were saying you know that's what they were just
because there's a lot of people that have been through something similar
that have never had a voice you know or have never been taken seriously and
they appreciated this the way this film approached it because it wasn't you know
and i'm not trying to sell UFOs or anything it's just like i'm telling a story that happened
mm-hmm you know um and that's the way one of the reasons they like it also it's like there's
nothing to push here has anybody you ever talked to or interviewed that went through one of these
these experience had multiple experiences that's something i noticed in travis walton's his podcast
he would show rogan he talked about something happened with his son or something he was like
very hesitant to bring it up towards the end of the interview wow i didn't i miss that interesting
i forget exactly what happened but something okay i remember what it was now he said that
he woke up one night in the middle of the night and then you know again it's it's really hard to
because with some of these people
when i listen to them talk i can kind of hear their ego talking so i'm not saying that's travis's
case but some people have this idea in their head that they are the chosen ones or they're
more important than anyone else correct so they have these dreams or they they construct these
things in their heads that this for sure happened to me and whether it's because they like the
attention or they like talking or they like hearing themselves whatever it may be that's
always in the back of my mind but sure but regardless what travis mentioned towards the
interview which he was very hesitant to talk about was that one night he will found himself
sleepwalking and he woke up he said he woke up in a full sprint down his hallway running to his
son's bedroom and then when he got to his son's bedroom he said he found his son hanging off the
edge of the top bunk you know those rail like protective railings on top bunk so he found his
son like his body had fallen off and his neck was stuck in there and he was like suffocating
and he said if he hadn't got there and the next 60 seconds his son would have died
but he he related that he related it to his experiences with his abduction he said that
there's something there or something happening why would i wake up in a full sprint towards
my son's bedroom wow but there's there's i've noticed that with i talked to you another guy
who i had on this podcast who wrote a book up there it's called The Messengers his name is
Mike Clellan and he talked about his experiences he said that he's gone through many of these
experiences too and it's sort of parallels what travis walton was talking about where it's now when
you have these throughout your life these deep meaningful experiences you kind of just like
lump them together into this like supernatural spiritual sense i think that's a choice you know
in my opinion like even even the ego part of it if you know there's there are people that i know
that i believe genuinely have encountered these things but it depends what the human
being like the person does with it you know like the people like a lot of people that
take it to a spiritual place or or they take it to an egocentric place is kind of in my view
i think it's a defense you know a way to deal with it or a way to have all the answers
when you don't have any right like that's the thing about this whole thing i think anybody
will really tell you if you ask them like they've got 10 million questions you know they don't have
a lot of answers but people try because they need to keep their mind together so they'll
create the story they need to create in order for it to make sense so they can live on their life
you know because it is that shattering not you know it is a john mac called it ontological shock
the breaking of your worldview for your worldview right the shattering of your worldview everything
you believe is no longer is in question all of a sudden because you just got this new piece of
information that's gigantic and how do you survive knowing that how does how do things have the same
value when you know that so i think there's a lot of um you know i've seen people get out there and
they talk about this and they put it in religious context or spiritual context and i'm like you
know that's interesting but i don't know if you have to even go there i think you might be going
there to keep it together you know what i mean because the real truth for me when i look at it
is like it's just that's just the way it is i don't have to i mean and what's wrong with just
having a million questions not having all the answers it's a very uncomfortable place to be
i had to put myself in that position over and over and over in this making this doc
like all right let's just pull back not try to control it not try to you know make it one
thing or the other let's just take it for what it is and what does that mean and the conclusion
i always come to is like we've got a lot of questions to answer like we could keep the
entire population on the planet busy for a long time trying to get to the bottom of these questions
did john mac ever talk to betty and barney hill or was that before him let's see
maybe this is something that we should look up austin well i know bud hopkins did um
david jacob some sure did uh john mac was alive for a long period i'm sure they must
have had contact at some point but by that time i forget to go he would have put that in his book
abductions right he would have he would have and he he he had talked to a lot of people
the people when he did abduction he chose particular cases to point out particular things
and the way different people were handling it like in that book there was a lot of different
ways people were handling it in their own lives to address it spiritually or yeah you know
just raw reality you know it's different it's it's human perspectives human interpretation
and belief system it really boy i mean john mac spoke about that and so does a lot of people
have about just the worldview and um when it shattered you you tend to grasp onto things
that make you feel safer yeah i'd be interested to find out if he ever talked to them i'm sure he
did because i i'd met betty hill i think it was a 96 she was chain smoking like crazy
oh really met her i met her with a friend of mine we and uh she was uh she died like a year
after that oh wow um and i know here her granddaughter actually is doing a lot of research on the
subjects her granddaughter is a ufc fighter i think really yeah well the other granddaughter is a
works for a mutual ufo network oh really yeah she's like what's your name
kathleen kathleen marden kathleen marden okay great she's a good person pull her up kathleen marden
this is uh this is what he pulled up previously i was talking we were talking about those
grabby alien civilizations this is uh the work of uh robin hansen and uh what does this say there
are two kinds of alien civilizations quiet aliens don't expand or change much and then they die
we have little data on them and so must and so must mostly speculate via methods like the
drake equation loud aliens in contrast visibly change the volumes they control and just keep
expanding fast until they meet each other as they should as they should be easy to see we can fit
theories about loud aliens to our data and uh and say much about them as s j olson has done in seven
related papers in links hall of papers hmm well that's interesting i mean yeah so like that that
graphic that he has there i guess that this represents all the different um alien civilizations
in the universe and eventually they will all just be touching one another and there will be no more
room for people for new civilizations or new species to come up because the universe will just be full
boy there's a lot of space out there yeah well it's like i think you know again i always go back
to what i know which is wildlife and you know if the if you give them an opportunity they're
going to move into that area you know exactly that's what that's what that's what we do yeah
that's what we that's what human beings do we we tried to grab more and gain more resources
and control more we expand naturally is what we do and uh you know it's funny he compared it to
malignant cancer it's like six these alien civilizations um he's right about the quiet
ones too because you know how we we just discovered a reef you know i think it was in the atlantic
where this whole like community of creatures we've never seen before you know or not this type
have been living forever for a long time you know for a long time and they didn't spread or go you
know what i mean they created their own little quiet biosphere they're happy they didn't need to
expand like yeah so he's right because i was wondering i kind of disagreed with the quiet but
you know what there's examples of that in our own world if they became grabby they would
they wouldn't let their kind travel out to other civilizations because they would understand
that if they went there they would take control of whatever is there and start some sort of a new
civilization that would queen bee that would threaten their civilization so they purposely
wouldn't allow expansion bees do that right but then how do you explain ufo's though so do they
let certain do they let out certain sort of hall monitors outside of the civilization to go to other
stars to make sure other civilizations aren't becoming quote-unquote grabby and aren't expanding too
much and making sure they don't destroy a planet i have no idea that's the questions like we have to
address like what what is a what what are these things what what part of a civilization are we
seeing i mean maybe they're i was like it maybe somebody said a long time ago maybe it's just
their kids you know this is their kid science experiment you know it's not their main adults
that are doing different things you know but that's very possible with a highly advanced species
you know what are we seeing what part of their species are we seeing the science guys
or what and how big is that so i mean there's so many questions that we have to address i think
and i think there's plenty of data out there that this has been going on that's just we're not
willing to talk about it yet that's really how it looks we're just not ready and we're getting there
now you said like some of the biggest the biggest correlating physical things that like people at
john mac found talking to all these people were scars on the body were there any other sort of
like implants or anything yes or like things that can't be explained yeah like what um things that
were under the skin of the person i think roger leer who i don't really know too much about but he
was doing the deep dive on those types of phenomena that were happening to these same people they'd
have scars on their body and they'd have things that would come out of their body you know that
were underneath the skin or whatever and he was analyzing them um i mean somebody else has to do
that work right you know somebody people have been doing it right um and i guess kind of what
there isn't is just like a group of people working together you know in this field everybody seems to
be working on their own and doing the thing there's not like a university saying hey let's look at this
and everybody look on you know that's missing um in this phenomena um
but i think that's changing i think people there's a the scientific coalition on uap's that's out of
alabama really great organization of scientists that are really addressing this stuff um that's
probably we're gonna we're gonna see a lot of the breaking breaking news other than the pentagon
and what do you think i mean i'm kind of curious like the pentagon came you know the or the
intelligence committee came pretty far out there saying we think these things are we don't know
what they are we don't think they're trying you know and then they sort of came out with a second
report and kind of walked it back a little bit that's the second of the more sightings they had
over 500 documented well that was the interesting thing like oh they get even more cases but they're
sort of like oh maybe balloons you know yeah a lot of it was junk they said and there was even one
new york times which is probably true yeah but it doesn't explain all of it there was also a new
york times article austin maybe you can find this uh where they actually said it was one of the recent
ones where they talk about the the additional reportings coming out of over 500 documented cases
which came out what was that three weeks ago four weeks ago a month ago maybe
they said that some sort of analysis was done on that go fast video that claims and they
claimed in the article that thing was only going like 40 miles per hour which i find kind of odd
yeah i i have like listening to those pilots reactions yeah they're having a truck they're
having trouble locking on to something at 40 miles an hour yeah no do you know the gear on those
things oh yeah i mean it's incredible yeah no i mean i just from personal looking at that video
and looking at the waves and and what those are swells right you know that's a long distance
and that thing to me looks small you know really small and moving very quickly but you know
i mean who's analyzing it that's that's really the question
you know whoever's going to have their opinion what's their background what's their
yeah scroll down a large number of incidents remain unexplained in the new report of uh from
the office of the director of national intelligence potentially fueling further speculation scroll down
Sean Kirkpatrick that's one of the guys that ryan talked about who i think is one of the
guys that he met in that first when they first sent him to the pentagon after he came out
he's the head of the pentagon task force for examining unexplained incidents said
officials are setting up mechanisms to make sure that no american government testing or
classified programs like futuristic or secret stealth aircraft or drones is the cause of
these mysterious reports yeah the problem with the new york times is they don't like they're
they're skirting the the big the big idea here like they're skirting the main point of all of this
like all they want to do is focus on these little things like they like on the first thing they
came out with the only focus on the little a tip program they didn't focus on the big question
like what are these i think it's on purpose you know yeah the slow walk out
mm like it's a really deep conversation and they want to just i think there are people that
would just want to you think there's editors you think there's people that are kind of controlling
or controlling the editing of these articles that are posted on giant publications like the
new york times that are tied into the government or tied into certain agencies that are trying to
control the narrative or that are saying whether they whether the editors of these publications
consciously are aware if they're being controlled or not could there be people at what for example
the cia that are saying like we suggest you change this because you could endanger a lot of people
or you could endanger national security if you put it this way or if you focus on this thing
you think that that's possible um i haven't seen seen that but i would do that if it was me
me i'd control the narrative and uh how it's released mm yeah because it's a big deal it's
gonna affect everything so i would really want to be in control of how it gets out to the public
that just makes sense to me i would do the same thing because it's not
i and i don't have any examples of that i do know quite a few people that are involved with the
press releases and stuff and i i don't see any um i think there's an awareness actually
in the press that this has to be taken slowly other people otherwise people are just not gonna
they're gonna it seems like it feels like there is right yeah and i think it's wise it feels it
feels like they're following a script almost like they know what act they're in and they know what's
gonna happen in act three and act four and act five and they have to plan accordingly
yeah i mean first of all you gotta talk about these things that are in our atmosphere
you know that do pose a potential threat to safety i agree with that then we get down further down
the road and talk about what are those things doing here what are they where are they from
then we get down to who's piloting those things where you know this is down the road
and the conversation gets deeper and then the deeper you know we'll get to the place where like
okay we've been hearing about this for a long time and we thought these people were crazy
well you know it's cool we can't go there straight away it's it's fascinating too when you think
about the snowball effect that is happening with industry with with basically the monetization of
the subject the more the the just by giving us an inch in the new york times then look what happens
on the history channel and the discovery channel now they're getting so much more attention on
these shows that they're making and people are taking it seriously because people see that the
pentagon's talking about it and the new york times is talking about it so now there's so
much more money being made so much money on the table to be made on the subject and the
more films like yours that come out and other people who make films like this that are getting
more attention and more people from government bureaucrats coming out about it senators coming
out about it it enables just the industry to balloon more and that balloon it's like a it's
like a fucking positive feedback loop the more money that gets siphoned into this subject the
more pressure goes on the government to talk about it and come out about it the problem is how do
we know if it's true or not that from from the government's perspective like from whatever they
come out with how do we know how much deception is coming out and how much of it is real you know
it's it's almost like i'm a cynic to the point where whatever they say i feel like the opposite
is true sometimes yeah there's usually two two two agendas going on at the same time yeah um
i mean that that's something we should just talk about like what is conspiracy theory
you know that we use that word so casually but it's asking we like conspiracy things that don't
go away for a long time there's probably a reason why they don't or you know people like i don't
know no one's spying on us and then you have people whistleblowers come forward and tell us
things that you know are no longer conspiracies you know right so jeffrey epstein oh yeah i mean
one of the biggest ones right boy yeah that's a huge one yeah what's the what's the funny
it's who we knew it's who we knew the names he knew yeah and i whatever what's her name just so
galane maxwell yeah i worry about her well she doesn't even know her and i'm not i don't agree
with what she did but i'm like yeah i'd be really concerned for my life because of who who you know
yeah yeah the the famous quote about conspiracy theories is the biggest difference between uh
the truth and a conspiracy theory is six months that's good just give it time truth always comes
but truth always comes out even if it takes a hundred years or hundreds of years sometimes
yeah and they were like oh we used to that was we used to think that was crazy you know it's
accepted you know um yeah one of the biggest um you know i think one of the most important
things to happen in the evolution of technology or humans is like this podcasting thing because
it's kind of like broken through the main television narrative that people have been so
tuned into for whatever 50 years it's very controlled like even the ufo thing like you
know there are people making money on this it's not me it's not a small guys it's big companies
it's important though i think it's important that money is made on the subject i i agree with that i
do agree with that i just it's interesting who's kind of controlling it um it is uh i i've been
watching it for a while um what do you mean when you say who's controlling it just who who um
who has the power and the money to to bring shows out you know about this um
yeah i think it's changing podcasts are changing that you're right changing that whole environment
you know people a lot of people get their news from podcasts yeah instead of the news yeah um
which is it's great to have that other perspective like a different perspective not that all the
news is out there is well researched or um but you get an alternate opinion which is valuable
just to have just to have maybe well maybe you know let me look at it from this angle
instead of being fed right you know um yeah boy so fascinating talking with you
have you ever looked into um those bases out in Nevada like area 51 or s4 if you were
talked to anyone who's been to those bases or spill the beans yeah i'm a little hesitant for
good reason um yeah that um i mean i think uh boy i think a lot of the answers are out there
to be honest really i'm gonna get my ass kicked for saying that but um yeah i don't think it's a joke
i don't think it's conspiracy or anything um i'm just very careful about that topic i've heard
some crazy stories about those about i mean obviously there's the bob lasar thing but i've
heard some also some people have told me some stories about people they know who have worked
there like military people who have been there and like just had conversations with some of the
science guys who science you know researchers or engineers that were in the cafeteria and you
know just had conversations and some weird weird things that i never would have expected
it's the cutting edge of us right of our country it's our secret programs so there's a lot of
national security that has nothing to do with um other species um i guess that's kind of the issue
is like i saw something yesterday where there was like this big hauling truck with this fucking like
flying saucer looking thing on the back of it have you seen that on twitter that was a long time ago
yeah yeah i said it was like skunkworks or something that's lock it what the hell is skunkworks
that's lockheeds oh it's lock it's a company lockheed owns or something no it's it's uh
lockheed skunkworks i mean they built the the a12 and uh you know
the um all their spy planes oh god skunkworks is like their skunkworks the official pseudonym for
lockheed martin's advanced development programs adp formerly called lockheed advanced development
projects it is responsible for a number of aircraft designs highly classified r&d programs
and exotic aircraft platforms known locations include the united states air force plant number
42 and united states air force plant four most notably a major classified testing uh most a
most notably a majority of classified testing is thought to be conducted at sites such as the
nevada test site huh they're known for the p38 lightning which was developed in 1938 wow
fascinating yep yeah so pull up pull up the video of that object getting like a flying saucer
at skunkworks you know have you saw what do you think that was that's a good question
uh people were like joking about it like like making like making fun of the video or something
on twitter when i was reading the comments they were just like laughing at it i have no idea i saw
it and i'm like well i mean it's not very difficult to spoof that yeah right i mean i
someone would have to really get a lot more data on it to really do you know who um i'm sure you do
um put off is his last name what's his first name how al put off how how put off i remember
watching a video where he was and i guess for context he was the head of one like project
blue book or something is that what it was he was in charge of project blue book or was it one of
the other projects that was uh alan heineck alan he wasn't in charge of it but he worked i don't
think alan was the head of it um how was involved in um you have to look him up on
yeah wiki it's fascinating like he's talking about you know physics of yeah some real wild stuff
back in the 60s yeah okay this is a picture of the okay there it is yeah yeah yeah full screen that
thing yeah that looks like one of our advanced uh project look at that is there a video of it
go can you go like the next click the arrow to the right on the bottom yeah that looks like
hard stuff dude look at that thing look okay so they take the picture someone took a picture
and they basically figured out that it was some sort of test range but judging by the tree and
the big scaffolding in the background that doesn't look like any sort of like jet there's no there's
no jet output you know what i mean like there's no that we can see that we can see from the image
yeah yeah that to me that's an advancement on what we already have been doing it's just more
aerodynamic so pull up output uh output off how how hl hl pto ff yeah i watched a video where he
was talking about i think it was like one of those one of the Weinstein brothers was asking him about
anti-gravity and he was like basically yes we have we have there's private organizations that
have figured out anti-gravity and they aren't sharing it with modern academia probably true
that was fucking wild to hear that man's that man's a genius i've spoken with him a few times
have you really yeah and i've been honored to do so you know like man i'd love to spend
more time with that man you just know so much and a lot i'm sure that he can't even what did you guys
talk about um boy can't really talk about that i mean i'm not trying to be i just it was kind of
a private conversation um was it in regards to your film at all or yeah that's actually how we got
so you were doing research and you reached out to him or no i had i knew somebody that knew him and
i um just made it a point to to reach out to him and and speak to him about a few things
were you like was you like trying to confirm certain certain stories or was there anything
that had anything to do with like the narrative of your film specifically no no it was a wider
phenomenon you know and kind of my you know underneath or behind the film you know i was
really trying to find out who knows about this who knows about this you know someone's got it now
so i i went and did a lot of exploration into
people like that and other people in the military that would that would be in the know
of that about this so that was kind of a big drive and i did not come back
doubting that people knew this yeah so something that he was aware of i mean i can't speak how could
not be aware of the phenomenon right i'm sure he was but i think he is of course um well i think
a lot of people are at this point something shifted um and i really think it was in my personal
opinion and i may be wrong but i think a lot of the people that were initially involved in this
project you know discovery and research are all dying now and they they did a really poor job of
transition you know what i mean like bringing in new new people and and keeping the same level
of secrecy right i think they lost it right yeah i mean maybe in four years this all
all makes sense but i mean it really depends because you know when you do the deep dive on
something nobody really gets it until they do also that same deep dive how till later how
worked really closely with that that billionaire dude um his name is given was a what was his name
bob something yes bigelow bigelob robert bigelow who uh who's been deeply invested
see he's one of the guys when i listened to him talk i was just like i had bullshit detectors
going off left and right really yeah interesting you know when he's taught when he when you start
talking about like poltergeists and remote viewing like you start like you start to lose me that's
just my personal bias i kind of agree with that in a way i mean i'm nothing against bob but i
or anybody but i just think like this phenomenon of these craft whatever they are this other
thing that we don't know or understand probably is going to lead us to understand all those other
phenomenon you know and and we don't need to be talking about that yet like i i kind of agree
with that like we don't need to be talking about that yet because it's just people just write it
off you know they're like how how would it lead to some other things like this how would they be
connected um i think because of physics and because of another species understanding and
being able to manipulate things that were just learning exist um and control things that uh
and telepathy and things like that i mean the whole the whole idea of what do you call it um
you know remote viewing yeah i mean what is that that's basically
where did they get the idea yeah that is interesting where did they get the idea
well why why would they invest all the kind of money they did into it unless they knew it was
proven like that that's something else had done it well it's sort of like it's kind of like in the
realm of when you talk about things like mk ultra mind control right like it's something that they
maybe heard that another nation was doing militarily or strategically for war sure and then we figured
out we we thought oh god we gotta figure this out quick you know it seems like that that's the same
thing with with all of this stuff is like it all it all comes down to ball it all boils down to war
or national security yeah which is pretty much that's what follows everything that's all secret
yeah that's where all the money is right and where's that money going really you know probably
to the space program i would imagine i'll be you know this is kind of it may sound strange but
i think about this a bit like back in the early days you know when if this you know just i'll be
ginger about it like uh you know that we understood we we finally we had an example of a species that
survived beyond its planet and evolved far far far beyond us right like that's a big deal like
it's a proof of concept you know like we have an example of a species that's evolved further than us
that has gotten off their planet so like any good scientists would do would be we need to
copy that model we need to follow that model because we know it's successful right beyond us
but that may so i wonder like well maybe that's what we did and we've had all these technological
revolutions and everything else but that's what this other species path was that may not have been
what our path was meant to be i wonder about that but i understand like okay we've got a successful
example of another species let's follow exactly what they did let's duplicate them because we
know it's successful but we're not the same we haven't evolved in the same right we don't have
the same elements on our planet you're saying that hypothetically this could have happened
a long time ago that we discovered some sort of advanced being and technology and we decided
that we wanted an ultra arch trajectory yeah and that could be what these beings were communicating
to these kids that like you guys are evolving down the wrong path like technology like you're
you're tied to technology and the way you guys are advancing is not on the right path
pause i mean i am trying i'm trying i'm trying to understand like how your mind is sort of tying
all of your experiences and all your work together like yeah i have you know you just
have a lot of different thoughts you know and you in this you know they're theoretical
like they're speculative and but you it's good to entertain it just to go down those roads and say
well speculation what's there of course you know i mean i think the most exciting thing to be honest
is to is the potential that we could grow leaps and bounds you know by by learning something
that's already plotted out all the planets that's already out there they know what the
populations are what the wildlife on that planet is um or the life on that planet is
i mean boy we could take a huge jump in our evolution and it's kind of in line with the same
the opposite of what i was just saying about
how following another species because they are successful
i think has is is something that has to be carefully done
with the understanding like this these people these things have evolved in a totally different
way right and that may not be the best thing for us right and the technology question if we
go back to that well here we are building nuclear reactors on the the ocean right which we know is
gonna you know every time we have one of those natural disasters like Fukushima all the garbage
all the pollutants that went out into that ocean from that event we keep having that the ocean is
not going to survive there's concern about that you know by oceanographers by you know the acidity
level i think it's the acidity level in the ocean anyway that's a whole other topic but
it's a it's a it's a box full of questions and i guess the like the only thing i really would
love to see done is people ask more questions and we start to investigate these things and find out
because we're not we don't have to figure it out that's for sure what do you think needs to happen
to make the world take this subject more seriously
i think it's gonna have to come from some pretty big people
you know i really i do i i think that's gonna
lay the groundwork for the financial assets and assets like that are we already have
to be redirected to looking at this phenomenon i know it already has been done
but it's not being shared with us and i guess that's the big problem
and maybe they're right maybe they're you know people this is something people don't really
want to know and um i that's the big question right i mean why like why don't you just let's
let's move let's do it okay we're not alone great let's move on yeah i think once we understand that
we're gonna deal with our issues as a species way better than we have because we're not we're
gonna be because there's something from the outside we've never really had that
you know not it's it's always been spiritualized or religiousized or something
but just plain matter of fact there's another animal and one of the kids one of the arrow
kids said that to john mack during an interview he said so what do you think you know john mack
asked him so what do you think about it and the kid says there's other animals out there
i thought that was brilliant like it's so simple but there's other animals out there wow yeah
didn't make the movie so many great that's amazing cuts we could do a mini series like four episodes
easy with the amount of interview there's so much material you know it's so wow that there's
you know all of this talk about this and all of this evidence and for counsel of experiences and
videos radar videos but there's still not a fucking picture a real like there's pictures of
these things far away like like the one guy in australia and but there's no real like definitive
evidence of these fucking beings or these or these crafts that you can look at and be analyzed
say not CGI this is real that's amazing to me that they've alluded this i think they're there
being analyzed by some really good people so when they do publicize these videos and these
photographs that they're gonna have like papers that come along with them that are so extensive
about every little detail i know that exists so it's there i just it's it's being it's going to be
i just it's it's being it's going to be presented in a very different way
you know you know more scientific not just put on youtube right but analyzed by really good people
and i mean there's plenty of people who have said we've got we've we've already got the
that evidence just yeah but what how far does it go do you believe the story the do you believe the
the story of jackie gleason the president taking him to see the alien at homestead
air force base where he's like he knew jackie you know that story right i do know that story
who was the president i always forget the president was it eisenhower no i think it was
nixon it was nixon um the interesting part about those kind of stories is they persist
you know i'd like you know if i wanted to know about that story i'd like to go to jackie gleason's
family yeah his wife or nixon's oh she did yeah well yeah she talked about it she said
she knew her husband had always been obsessed with the ufo's they even even bought a fucking house
shaped like a flying saucer that's how obsessed he was and uh i think it was in upstate new york
and she she said that after he came home from that trip with nixon um he sat down and he was
just like look ghost white in the face that's appropriate and uh and he basically said that uh
he said don't let anyone ever tell you that this shit is not real because she said that he was
just in a catatonic state when he got back and he told he told her about his experience
well that's interesting but it was interesting to hear that yeah
i mean it's you know it's one of the biggest secrets on the planet
and and you know people are human beings have egos it's like well hey i want to show my buddy
this little blow his mind yeah yeah i mean who's he gonna tell no one's gonna believe him
i mean especially yeah right nobody's gonna fucking believe him that's that's the great
thing about it too because you can keep a secret because no one's gonna believe you
and they propagated that since 1953 since the robertson panel they propagated making people
look like fools and laugh at them you know the stigma they pushed it they made the stigma
right they created they weaponized it yep and it still exists even today it's amazing how well
that worked because it they're working on the unbelievable and that line of like yeah that's
so unbelievable i can't i'll just laugh about it right don't take it seriously because it's
heavy um yeah that's just it's a really i mean i kind of like look at everybody in the field
right now it's like wow we're just kind of you know pieces in a puzzle that's probably gonna go on
for hundreds of years before we actually you know have a significant hopefully it doesn't take that
i mean i never thought we'd be at this point you mean you never thought we'd get this far
never thought in your lifetime i'd never thought in my lifetime that i'd see what we've seen in the
last four years pilots top gun guys like yeah they don't come out they don't come out talking
about the aliens ever and they have ff 15 f8 f18 pilots f15 pilots f22 pilot you know these guys
are so well trained about what you know and they you know they see the officers at those nuclear
bases talking about it publicly yeah there's no upside for them how do you discredit those guys
yeah yeah they're in charge of the nuclear codes yeah yeah they're making sure that yeah
what did they say that literally like it it activated it sent the nuclear activation to
the rocket or to the nuke and like initiated like a countdown sequence that they had no
control over and then just shut it off i didn't hear that i just know that they completely
disabled you know like 10 separate missile silos and they couldn't figure out and at the same time
they were witnessing this crazy craft hovering above the silos above the silos and these guys
were 20 floors underneath you know and they all testified about it yeah yeah that's that's the
interesting thing too like the people that have testified um at the press club uh people that
testifying behind closed doors in congress for the intelligence committee i mean
that's a big deal we haven't heard we haven't heard the half of that yet you know how the minority
report you have the minority report and the majority report you know yeah they have the
public version and then the classified version because they don't want to reveal national
security secrets um that's what took the report so long you know this last report that came out
late was the di a going through everything and really yeah um making sure it's a crazy world
out there man yeah but at least we could sit here and talk about it i know it's really cool
yeah me too and i appreciate the we've been deep diving it's kind of interesting yeah it's really
it's new thoughts new idea yeah new things to think about and uh i just hope we get somewhere
you know it's been a long time that we've been dealing with this topic it would be nice to
to actually see us progress progress yeah and move beyond ideas or ridicule and just like let's
let's actually look at this me too man because what's what's i mean my concern personally is like
if we don't we're losing time you know if this is not a speak what's their deal what are they up to
right the longer we don't know that the worse off will be potentially i'm not saying it's a bad
thing good who knows i have no judgment about that it's just we should know as much as we can
as soon as we can couldn't agree more yeah tell people listening and or watching where they can
find your movie and anything else anything more to do with your work online on social media etc
uh yeah that's so we're at aerial phenomenon.com is a website um and then you can get the movie
there we're also on amazon and itunes and all the streaming platforms at this point aerial
phenomenon.com that's the website and then i'll link it below for people that want to see it
yeah and i highly recommend it very good movie thanks a lot of good people put a lot of time
into it and a lot of people volunteered their time to do it um yeah i mean there's so so many people
that eventually will be thanked for the further efforts because yeah people let me stay in their
houses for you know when i was in africa and man people were just amazing because they knew like you
know that wasn't some corporation driving this it was it was hard cool man good stuff man yes sir
i appreciate it again you too
