We're on Indian Rocks Beach. We're not. We're here, we're live from Indian Rocks Beach in
Tampa, Florida. Thanks coming out. We're here at Indian Rocks Beach. I hope you had a good
time. Watch out for crazies on the wings here. We got so much filler. It's ridiculous. I've never
seen so much filler in one place.
Busted! I found it! I feel like Christopher Columbus right now. We found Busted.
We found Busted. We're going to have a tea. Oh look, maybe a piss here. Maybe some
Charlestown. Busted! Alright, what are we doing? Are we going to Charlestown or are we going to Boston?
La Quinta Inn. Okay, I'm going to pull over. I'm going to call this fucking La Quinta Inn right here.
Call him. Call him, call him. I don't know if we can go to the stop. I don't know if we can go to the phone with him. We will be 35 miles away. No, we will pull over right up here in one minute.
How bad is it? Not bad. I just didn't see it there. I didn't see it either. There has been a few problems to her so far. The first day was hell on earth for me.
It's a worst case scenario. And I don't even know. No projector, no PA wires. I missed the first surf spot.
Tackled by a dirtbag.
I'm happy without drinking a beer. The next thing I know, we just show up here. Sarah, we just got here a little bit ago. I pull up first wave, he's dropping it on. He's got a beer in his hand and he's surfin' drinking beer.
Alcoholic luscious douchebag.
Got it.
Get aside all the jokes and all the screwing around. I don't even know you and I are my friend. If I was you, I'd get my surfboard, I'd go back out there, I'd give it back to Shay and I'd let him keep yours because you ain't even doing shit up there today.
My strategy today is mainly to be just paddling really fast. I want to have much speed when I stand up as I can because from there on I might slow down once I stand up.
I might slow down when I stand up.
Linda, you want me to bring the RDS's down?
Yeah.
Linda, you want your RDS?
Are we allowed to skim here?
RDS, baby.
The faster you run, the better you'll do every time.
You got it. Go low. Go low.
Go!
Yeah, you go left.
You got it.
Run, jump, slide.
One for another one.
I suck at skimming bringing my board into this.
Go!
Go!
What?
Damn.
You got the clip?
You gotta wonder how God created such a wonderful spot.
You know, it's awesome.
Small state with a big high.
We're about to get over the second bridge.
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, guy.
My name is Richard Abuteman.
Richard Abuteman.
I haven't slept much at all because I'm trying to chat down about it.
I'm trying to do a fucking interview here.
So it's definitely a lot harder than I thought to do this tour because
when we're all partying together, I'm doing an amazing job
because I can party amazing.
Actually, Corey's good. He gets up right away.
He's not hard to get up.
Alex, a princess, basically.
Like, even just with ordering food,
his salads have to be made at the end of a rainbow.
The only meat he eats is a unicorn meat.
Oh.
You see that?
That wave just spits so freakin' big.
Fucking surf pipeline for a living, bitch.
You have a fucking face.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.

Well, guess what we just did?
Just caught the best East Coast I've ever seen.

Boys are drinking course light and always be partying
and things be happening, man.
We caught some waves today.
We skim bored today.
Yo, run DS.
We're here at Roxanne's house.
I need a ham and cheese.
One went to North Carolina.
I love North Carolina.
Raise your hands up.
Get a fuck where you're going, sir.

Get in my drink.
I wouldn't have meant never.
Get a fucking animal.

Bones from fire.

Danny, do you have filters?
I can filter piss through my urinary tract.
I'm very hungover.
Look at that tattoo.
This girl gave me crabs.
Here's only one.
Well, we're in Kildale Hills and I'm going skim bored.

How much do you think it'll take to get there?
At age.
No, I'm not.
Yeah, I'm in.
I want to pay for that.
You fucking delete that right now.
We're light.
I need another light.
Welcome to 21.
Fucking giant.
Gross.
How long did you have to ship for?
Like, that was 10 minutes.
That's ridiculous.
Yeah, we're late now.
Why did you do that?
Fuck what?
I might like it.
I might not.
That would be awesome if you guys were like six or retarded.
I know.
Right.
Big keys.
Little keys.
Big hug.
