We got okay. Do you have enough raw sugars over there? I mean listen this is this was
look at all that shit it's not it's not what it's not what it looks like it's not an issue
it's not an issue it's I you never know I've got them before where they give them to me
and they don't put any fucking sugar in them. Matt's got raw sugar running through his veins
right now. I'm almost done with this one and I'll finish that one I mean I gotta be up
I woke up at four o'clock in the morning I ran five and a half miles I'm fucking I'm dead

drive a piece of shit vehicle yeah I'd put more oil in my car the other day I'm putting a
quart of oil a month in that thing. Anyways what are we gonna do today so we had the great idea
actually you know what I'm gonna give this kid a shout out. You had a great idea this is a great
idea. This wasn't actually my idea. No I'm gonna admit that this wasn't my idea. Huge shout out to
this dude on Instagram. Jack McHugh. Alright. Dude DM'd me and said hey Danny was watching the
channel had an idea for content with Matt Cox. Nice. He thought about doing commentary while you
guys watch his American Greed episode would be great content. Great fucking idea and here we are
two days later we're doing it. Alright I'm in the middle of doing a podcast let me call you back
period also I'm looking for the second porn star's name period. You're such a big shot now you talk to

This is the writer guy that I work with. Okay cool. So yeah I got it. Okay so how was your trip to
Houston you did a huge podcast out there. It was good it was good it was with Patrick Bet David he
does a value tainment and he contacted me because of because somebody on his staff when the producer
saw this and he brought it up and said you got to see this and he told him about you know my story
he said oh I got to see that guy and he they flew me out there and I did the did it and it was good
the problem with it was the guy has he actually interviews you. Unlike unlike you unlike concrete
so he actually has like a format where he starts asking questions and instead of just let me tell
the story I end up kind of being interviewed and being thrown questions that I have no you
never get a rhythm like I'm used to telling the story I've been telling this fucking story for 10
years so I'm used to just telling the story I sit down they go so what happened bro and I go okay
here's what happened boom boom boom boom boom so I have the whole thing laid out what's hard when
somebody says so when'd you get the mortgage industry okay what are your parents like oh okay
well what happened you're like fuck I'm all over the place I'm like I got no rhythm here so I don't
feel like I don't feel like I shit out of that I don't feel like I did a good job they edit the
shit out of it they produce the fuck out of that thing they add all kinds of music yeah they do a
good they do a good job yeah it's great it's super entertaining yeah I mean he's got a fucking huge

I was writing it because I didn't know everything I'm getting I'm getting FBI 302 forms in I'm getting
the fucking MOI forms from the Secret Service like there's all kinds of shit I didn't know that
we're happening behind the scenes that is the final cover you're gonna have it like this but in color

fucking red text with like the blue water in the background just like jaws
everybody's a critic I was gonna do one another one blue with a bunch of sharks and have me on
the front cover because only you know I typically I wasn't gonna do that but I thought about it I
thought all my other books have the actual subject on the cover so this one I thought well maybe I
should be on this somebody said you should be on the cover yeah so me on the cover with a bunch
of sharks and whatever so but yeah that's the book man it's like I like it it's it's yeah it's
it's good stuff man it's just it's people are gonna love this one because everyone loves your
story I think the most listen I everybody you know here's what the thing is everybody on the
in the comments are like um oh you know I'm so glad you're turning a new leaf and you're
staying out of trouble and you're doing the right thing buy a fucking book yeah you want to help me

hard on myself in it I mean I I say exactly just what happened this is what happened this is how
it happened the whole thing unlike American greed which we are about to watch yeah thanks for the
introduction it's about 90 true act nine maybe 95 it's it's a little skewed here and there but yeah
you know it's pretty accurate but there's you were in you were locked up the first time you saw this
right no where were you it came out they came to me this was part of the reason I got a reduction
was just to do the interview with American greed they came to me sent me a letter sent my lawyer
letter sent the U.S. attorney letter said we're doing this story we'd like to talk to Cox I called
my lawyer my lawyer said I got the letter I'm the U.S. attorney's already called me they want you to
do an interview so they set up an interview a phone interview because you can't get you cannot get
cameras into federal prison anytime you see people will say oh no I've seen pictures of guys
on camera in prison yeah those are state prisons they're not federal so you can't get a camera in
so I did a phone interview and they use bits and pieces of the phone interview okay they interview
Allison Arnold which is one of my one of my co-defendants they interview who else they interview
the U.S. attorney they interview the Secret Service agent they do not interview Candace Calderon
which is the FBI agent the lady who called you when you were on yeah yeah um that's that would
have been good yeah that would have been you would have seen her too she's like she's telling you
she's like five ten fake breasts good-looking intimidating as fuck mean like just fucking
angry bro it's like there's no reason to be that angry just even I mean literally there was literally
when she was interviewing me there was a a don't lie to us moment I was like the fuck
she's in the fucking table I mean she's like it was like it was like something out of like
like a real cop show or something like a fucking line what are you talking about
yeah she's she's got issues wow she's got anger management issues she's still around
she's still in the agency she's got it she has to have retired by now yeah that was a
fucking long time ago but where were you the first time you saw this episode I was uh

something would happen he'd stop it and go is that what really happened I'd be like yeah that's
what happened and he'd play it and he'd go is that what happened and I go now that what kind of
in that I explain it so that was my first so I've already done this really once all right let's
do this let's roll this thing done da da da da da here we go the premiere of the what's the title
of this of this American greed episode is there like a title to it or the Bonnie and Clyde of
mortgage fraud the Bonnie and Clyde of mortgage fraud here we go ladies and gentlemen
are you gonna put it up in this episode of American greed he had millions and millions
and millions and millions and more millions Matt Cox and Rebecca Hawk Matt says I gotta get
out of here I gotta leave you know you want to come the Bonnie and Clyde of mortgage fraud
this plan was to get as much as he can look at you dude look at that hairline I know that's
oh this is rough you look Hispanic what was tan
and go somewhere else and do it that's that's Allison at that point I really did I thought
they'll never catch me
this is kind of what your value tainment podcast is going to look like yeah
in Tampa Florida a young man named Matt Cox is making a killing in real estate
he has fast cars lots of cash there's always a pretty woman at his side part of his character
was like this mystery man like this mysterious like who is he
Allison Arnold is new so who is Allison Arnold again um Allison Arnold was a mortgage broker
that was working for another mortgage company and she and the guy the guy that owned the
mortgage company I'm just you know his name is Eddie Stralis uh Eddie owned a mortgage company
called uh Tampa Heights mortgage and she was working there well Eddie called me up one day
he's like look she's got this she's a mortgage broker she's got this loan we can't get it closed
I don't know what to do can you talk to her so I go in I look at the at the thing and I remember
the uh the comparable sales were too far away and the there were no comparable sales
that justified the the sales price right in the area and I was like look they're going
three and a half miles away and she was like yeah that's what they said and I was like look
everything's good in it but the appraisal is fucked up you need to and she's like well what do I
do I said well give me the file and I'll close it and she's like well what do I get I was like
well I mean I'll give you 500 bucks she's like I need what do you 500 dollars I was like you can't
close it you can't close the loan it's done he's got a real estate commission off it these people
want to buy the house give me the file you're good thanks I appreciate it 500 bucks that's what
you get for a referral fee and she's like I really need the money and and and and look you saw her
look look at her you know I'm a sucker I mean fuck she's she's adorable so which you know is wrong
to you know judge her on that because she was also a very smart person single mother single mother
single mother which we know I like she's recently divorced struggling to raise a young son
Allison meets Matt Cox in the spring of 2003 and quickly begins to fall for it he had a nice place
he had really nice furniture he was just really well connected his friends were all young and
successful I thought the mortgage business was that Matt Cox is a mortgage broker real estate
rehabber an overall renaissance man he's a talented artist who paints elaborate murals
in all his properties I forgot about that and he's obsessed wow you tell me that yeah con men well
that's actually an artist by the name of Tamar De La Pack and she's one of my favorite artists and
I would take I would make collages of her artwork because I the place I bought was built in like
1901 and she was circled I'd say 1920s which was the art deco so it was close it's a different
style but whatever it was close it was so I collages and I think I'm in and I paint them and
and they were cool but the Allison thing I was gonna say what ended up happening was I ended up
splitting I think I split the commission with her so okay but I ended up closing the loan
that she couldn't close okay and so she ended up coming to work for me because she was like look
I can't you know you I couldn't close this thing here you handed it you guys close it like that
I said look come work for me I talk about I talk about all that in this book look
he loved going to the movie theater and we would go and see movies like the one that I fell in love
with that we saw was the Italian job to us and he just loved that movie he's like look at them and
they got away with it you know he loved when people got away with that don't break my heart you told
me you were through after this I am I swear like his heroes in the movies Matt Cox dreams of doing
one big score and then going legit here's the plan he'll assume fake identities take out multiple
mortgage loans did how did they get those ID cards I was just thinking that because you
know I've only seen this once um did they make those no no those right there I I think those
are the actual ones I think the Secret Service probably gave that really the Secret Services
interviewed I'm sure they gave full cooperation US Attorney's Office was interviewed and they
wanted this episode multiple mortgage loans on properties he doesn't own and pocket the money
on average each loan will be around $100,000 all I wanted to do was get a million dollars
and you know open a legitimate business sell paintings or buy some real estate and rent
our apartments or something legit so I didn't have to do anything else
Allison goes to work at Matt Cox's mortgage company not knowing what's in store for her
just a few weeks later Cox calls in a favor when Allison was down on her luck he helped her out
he rented an apartment for Allison and bought her new furniture now it's payback time
does that sound sinister is that true uh that that's actually true I did buy her she had
she was going it does sound sinister she was going through a divorce first of all
first of all I don't owe you anything I met you because you gave me a loan I gave you your money
yeah you wanted to come work for me you came to work for me great I gave her a bunch more loans
she closed more loans these are fraudulent loans she knows that frauds being done there so I'm not
luring you in you know what's going you've closed several loans at this point they're fraud yeah
so but one of the things was she was living in her husband's house and they were going through
a divorce she wasn't divorced already she was getting a divorce so I was I'm sleeping with her
I'm sleeping with another girl named Jana so these two are fighting back and forth it's just a
fucking soap opera bro Jana lives across the street from me she's got a fucking girlfriend
that chick hates my guts um I mean it's just fucking ridiculous bro I mean Jana's chasing
fucking Allison out of the house she's chasing other girls I mean it's just it's fucking outrageous so
the point is is that I end up she needs a place to stay and she's like look I'm in my husband's house
you know Jana showed up at the fucking house one day at her husband's house where she lives and is
telling him she's fucking his boss I mean it's just ridiculous so he's like you got to get out so
she gets out and she's like what do I do I'm like look well I don't want her to move in with me
I mean I like Allison but I can't ever move in with me you know so I go and I rent her an apartment
in the name of uh Brandon Green one of my fake people so I rent the apartment I then take his
credit cards and I go buy her a bunch of shit at home at uh uh rooms to go buy her a bunch of
furniture all Brandon Green Brandon Green buy she's got a like a I think it was a two bedroom two
bath nice place in Ebor city and with that new huge apartment complex um so she moves in there
I give her fucking money I pay her fucking rent I don't owe you anything but I'm doing
all of this but the way they make it sound he's you know he got her a place he she owes him he
doesn't owe me anything she's asking me to commit fraud but but you know but I mean but which but
what they are saying is yeah she did come to work for me that's true she did come to work for me
she was making money doing fraud I did rent her a place so you know to me that's like a 90 percent
that's like 90 true I mean they're just kind of tweaking it a little bit which is fine
he's like Allison I'm helping you and my investors are helping you
so that we have your loyalty so that you'll do anything for us there are no investors what
the con man wants is for Allison to be his partnering crime he wants her to assume a fake
identity and apply for a mortgage loan not once or twice but seven times seven different banks
he's already stolen an identity for him the name Rosita Perez a real person who supposedly
crossed a friend of his the funny thing is look at me I've got bluish green eyes I had blonde hair
at the time pale skin and I was pretending to be Rosita Perez the bankers the closer for the title
company they're like how'd you get this name you're not Puerto Rican or Spanish are you and my
license that I had brown eyes and I clearly didn't maybe Allison looks too innocent to pull off a con
whatever the reason the first time she tries it she's successful she walks away from the bank
with a check for one hundred seventeen thousand dollars what was that about yeah what she and I
went and we found a house we rented the house she rented the house and I went with her we walk in
the house she likes it the guy comes in the investor that owns the house comes in meets her
they uh he she signs a lease she gives him some money she rents the house I go to public records
I take the deed that's in the house from his name and I put it into her name Rosita Perez's name
and we satisfy the loan that he had on the house so now she owns the house Rosita Perez owns the house
free and clear so then we just then we apply for like five six seven five six six they said seven
mortgages I want to say was five or six but whatever let's say it's seven who cares um she applies for
the loans we schedule a bunch of loans we're over the next two or three days she's going to close on
like a million dollars worth almost a million dollars worth of loans maybe seven on this dude's
house on this guy's house okay well I mean you know okay I feel bad about that what am I supposed
to say I mean that's what it was I mean he's gonna be fine yeah he's gonna be fine he eventually the
title title insurance companies will pay it back that's what always happens that's the
truth for that yeah no one feels bad for the insurance companies anyway okay
okay this is surveillance footage of Allison trying to deposit the check
I was the girl that went to the bank and I gave the check to the taller I would say okay deposit
this into my account and then I'd go slowly to pull the money out week after week supposedly
we never got that far the check wouldn't clear the bank because the driver's license was fake
yeah you know what happened there okay so here's what really happened
so here's what really happened what really happened was
the girl and I'm not going to say the girl's name which was a mortgage broker that worked for me
why wouldn't you want to say her name well because she's currently works at a bank
oh okay she she had a friend a girl that she says fucked her over like oh she tore up my
she was living in her house she tore up my furniture she cost me ten thousand dollars
you know if you if you ever if you want to use her information I want to get to get her fucked up
fuck her you know do something you know this chick's committing fraud on a daily basis at the
mortgage company too by the way so she's like can you do I'm like I don't want to do any I don't
want to steal anybody's identity I'm making the fake people but she keeps pushing Allison's pushing
so I use her because she had like 750 credit scores so I was like okay so I said yeah but
this chick is from New York does she have a driver's license down here she's no she just
moved here a few months ago she hasn't even opened a bank account nothing so she doesn't have a
driver's license issued in Florida I can go and get and make you one that hasn't been placed with
anybody yet or assigned anybody and then I can go and I could open up a bank account I'd been doing
it all my fake people are being are opening up bank accounts using fake fake driver's license
numbers so I can make one for her and it will be fine so we put it on the license which Allison
goes and opens up a bank account and the bank account it gets flagged because turns out that
the girl had had gotten a driver's license which I didn't know about because I was told she didn't
have one so she did get a driver's license in Florida she had it did have one assigned
she was so when she walked in she gave her an all a different number it wasn't the same number that
showed up in check systems they said boom there's this fraud something's wrong so she wasn't able
to open the bank account but that's not even the main issue the main issue was that she went to one
title company closed the title got the money the next closing she went to the woman at the title
company looked at her license and went this doesn't look like you it was her it was her
license it was her picture I had her dye her hair black and curl it and go in and get a DMV
photo and do the whole thing it was really her picture but a couple days before the closing
she dyed her hair blonde and we were like what the fuck are you doing and she's like no it's
still my picture and we're like you're Rosita Perez you're a Spanish chick the very least you
I mean yeah you can say that you were married but you still why why change your your hair is black
on the picture and so she's all she's like it's not a big deal I mean what's the problem oh my god
you're overreacting so she goes in boom second closing the chick the woman that the title company
is like this something doesn't make sense has her sign all the documents but won't give her the check
wow so that's what really happened was then she goes in the bank she can't open the bank account
then she gives the check to a buddy of mine who's running a similar scam in Orlando
and it's been flagged so now it's been flagged that's what what really happens they streamline it
okay thanks but none will take it though this scheme is foiled Cox hasn't given up the dream
of doing one big score and living the rest of his days on a beach in the Caribbean is that true
is you have like a certain amount of money in your head like I'm just gonna hit one big lick and
then I'm moving to the Caribbean is that true no not really when I I mean and I say that in here I
just said a million I just want to get like a million dollars and I mean I may have said that
and I did want to get some money you know I wanted I don't quit I don't think I had a million dollars
because there were multiple times we had a million dollars okay yeah that's what I thought you know
I'm saying so it doesn't but a lot of times you have to understand too if we had five million
or three million dollars out well if we own four million dollars in fucking mortgages or four million
dollars in real estate you see what I'm saying it's like you never really have that money in cash
it's always equity right Matt was the most greedy person out there and what he wanted was money money
money money he didn't care who he hurt who he stepped on or what he had to do in order to get it
nice so listen right now so I was watching this in when I was with Trion and Mike
at the gym when she said that I'd been talking to Allison in the halfway house right the whole
time so I picked up the phone and I called her right then right then and I went Matt is the
greediest person I've ever met in my entire life and she goes you don't understand they interviewed
me for hours they chopped it up it's not like that it's not like that's what she said and she's like
you know I'm so I was trying to get my sentence reduced you don't I was like laughing I was like
I don't care it's fine oh my god it was funny though Cox and Allison break up and Cox goes
looking for another woman to play Bonnie to his Clyde he's very you know charming in the beginning
told me how much he cared about me and loved me and what you know with us to get a place together
Rebecca Hawk is another single mom who's fallen under the spell of another single mom her story
does not have a happy ending but it begins with promise all of his friends and I've been watching
brand new cars gorgeous homes I mean and I'm thinking how the heck is I'm barely making a
sure I'm a single mom but well I have a quote Matt Cox is an unlikely ladies man he's diminutive
diminutive what's just mean what was fucking 2000 it was 2000 it was 2003
so look so the guy that we stole the house remember we got the house from
here's a quote from him in the book because at the beginning of each chapter I but here's a quote I put
and his name was Steven Jackson real estate investor he put it's almost impossible to stop them when
they're this talented and smart as smart as these people wow so I have a bunch of quotes from just
different things that people have said throughout the whole thing but I remember I had a quote from him
it's a good quote but what he lacks in height he makes up for in street smarts he was very persuasive
as far as how we handle things and talk to people and got things I needed the part and he was in
charge of a lot so I liked that I like that he could you know the way he handled things
Matt Cox grew up in Tampa he showed an early whoa look at that how old were you there
17 Jesus studied art in college in an exclusive phone interview with American greed
Cox says he always knew art was no way to get rich quick I mean I never expected to be an artist
because I guess I don't know I just didn't think I was ever gonna be good enough or make enough money
as an artist to survive his real talent is the art of the con and the knack for finding the perfect
sidekick they were single mothers divorced they had money problems they met him by and large on
online dating services where he came across as this sort of smart well-to-do mortgage broker
you know who's artistic and who is this guy this is Jeff Testerman he wrote 34 35 articles on me
for the St. Petersburg Times he's kind of like the guy that broke the story oh really yeah really
has a great sense of humor and drives a nice car I think that the women while vulnerable
wanted a piece of the pie as well he could tell that I was you know someone that wouldn't tell on
him and you know he could but in the meantime he's offering me all this money and saying he
wants to take care of my son and I send Bryce to a private school and I'm thinking you know okay I
knew her about a month finally you know I can I met someone that I know about wants to take care of my
son and I and I don't want to be able to do it and not really paying attention to the uh or not
wanting to pay attention to what he was doing online and you're about a month we've been on
Matt Cox decides Rebecca Hawkes a dozen dates at most he shows her a good time charms her and
takes her to a movie that could be about his own life we saw matchstick man and it's about a con
we did see her a con man con artist yeah I think we did see that flim flam man matchstick man loser
whatever you want to call take your foot a lot of it was probably me just wanting to overlook it
more so than being realistic and thinking okay what are you getting involved in here
when american greed returns matt cox and rebecca hawke go on the run and swindle the world's biggest bank
what bank was it the world's biggest bank you said bank of america
this is great so far con artist you prefer con artist over con man
you're an artist and you're in combat it's true in kappa a rogue mortgage broker named matt cox
is assuming fake identities to take out multiple mortgage loans on properties he doesn't own
pocketing the money and making millions in the process
the year is 2003 in a red hot real estate market the con man hides in plain sight
everybody was getting rich everybody was flipping property jeff testerman is an
investigative reporter with the saint petersberg times in the fall of 2003 he gets a tip from
an associate of matt cox and we began to talk and he suggested things to me uh the way a good
source is supposed to do he gave me the leads and i went to the courthouse and got the documentary
evidence to show that he was telling the truth testerman's source says that matt cox the artist
is using a palette of fake names i called them color-coded aliases charles white
james red brandon green uh matt cox had a sense of humor about these things
cox uses the aliases to create shamp reservoir dog reservoir dogs i had william blue i had lee
black i had miss michael white i had brandon green james red uh david silver um but a bunch of them
and a bunch of them that's where you got it from yeah yeah that's great yeah remember i told you
that the guys were at the guy had to the way i was doing because the people don't exist so who's
going into the closing right right so i the title companies would let would because i was had because
of the mortgage company and we were doing so many mortgages you could go to a title company if you
were the broker and you could say look my guy's at work can i bring him the title stuff the
title policy or sorry can i bring the closing documents to his work and let him sign them
and they're like i'm supposed to be there to notarize it and they you know but you know if
you're closing a bunch of loans with this this title company what are they gonna say it's like
you know hey man what's the big deal we closed fucking 10 loans here last month 20 what do you
know and they're like all right all right they give me give it to me so they give me the package and
i'd have lee black sign the documents i go sit in the parking lot and sign the fucking documents
and then i they'd say make sure you get a copy of the driver's license no problem i'd have a copy
of the driver's license i put it down i'd go back in and i'd hand it to him they'd go thanks matt and
then they'd notarize their signature the guy was never there they'd hand me all the checks and i'd
leave and i've got all the checks they've got a closing package the lender has a closing package
i make three or four payments five six payments and then i let the let the place go into foreclosure
so what wouldn't have happened one time i so i never went to a close i only ended up going to
one closing at sun trust i i borrowed 250 thousand dollars and i went in as james read but i think
it was james read anyway one time we were doing closings and someone somehow or another the title
agent figured out she figured out that something wasn't right like somebody told her i'm almost
positive someone did tell her somebody told her look these loans that you're closing these people
don't exist because suddenly she called the mortgage broker and she said listen this guy james read
the next closing he has he has to show up well when i made these fake driver's licenses i would
i would i need a photo so i would go online to hillsborough county's arrest records and i would
just get a photo well for james read i was using the photo of a guy named eric tomargo a guy that
used to trim uh lots for us like he trimmed the trees and cleaned the yards everything and
hallway garbage or if i bought a piece of shithouse for 40 grand he'd clean up the yard
take the stuff away so um i i had gone online one day and i found his picture i was like
fuck so i used his picture for james read put it in there not thinking anything you know just
more of a joke yeah because a lot of the guys were people i i knew because i thought you know
maybe if i need the guy i need to know the guy i don't know just felt like you get a pickle yeah
i could at least go to him and maybe try and get him to act as the person something i wasn't sure

that i actually call up and schedule a closing i say hey
mary can i pick up the fucking thing this time or you still got to see this guy
no no it's okay and she lets me take the package Jesus starts all over and so that's how like
that's the only time i had to have one somebody show up then i ended up showing up like one of
the last loans like closes closed for 250 i just showed up myself because it was everything was
just so streamlined it was working so well right well it seemed it was working so well yeah until
the allison thing happened and then it all just kind of fucking i didn't know it was
all right let's keep rolling it real estate transactions there were several that
that nothing was authentic on the deed he created a phony buyer and a phony seller
when you've got that going you can pretty much do anything you want to with the price
and the mortgage in 2003 money is loose and so are lending standards cox applies for loans online
and he uses his artistic talent to forge any document he needs to support the loan
he fakes drivers licenses w2s checking accounts and cox even brags about stealing the identities
of homeless people i ordered his social security card i ordered everything went and sat in dmv for
three hours and they gave me a driver's license as gary solovan it was easy
this is one of cox's fake documents it purports to be a satisfaction of mortgage statement a
document that says cox owns a property free and clear it's signed by two witnesses lee cook and
jimmy balls jimmy balls their characters dreamed up by cox the two witnesses balls and cook
i think cox's shorthand on this would be you know arrogance yeah this is arrogance
this is stupidity i just you know i'm really cooking the books with this deal and it really
takes balls to do it cox files the document at the hillsborough county courthouse to most banks it
looks legit and cox can take out mortgages on a property that he doesn't even own the person
that's living in the property is still making the payment so it's not drawing any kind of
red flag or anything so that's what he would do and you just get someone that's working at the
courthouse doesn't you know they're not paying attention and you have the satisfaction sent back
to you and it shows that you own it by the end of 2003 cox has done 90 fraudulent real estate deals
totaling almost four million dollars by the end of 2003 you had done that much the in number was
see the number is always shifting they said it's like a hundred and a hundred and nine transactions
is what they the fbi said that i did and they said i borrowed 11.5 million dollars now he's saying
what do you say four million but at the st petersburg times jeff testament is about to go to print
with a major expose of cox's scheme cox catches wind that he's about to be front page news
and matt knew that if this came out it was all going to come down on him i remember thinking if
i ever got in trouble and had to run i would do that i would take a bunch of money and run matt
says i got to get out of here i got to leave you know you want to come rebecca hawk has known matt
cox for just six weeks incredibly she puts her 13 year old son brice on a plane to her mom's house
says goodbye to him and hello to life as a fugitive
it was it was so hard and i was crying hysterically and brice is like mom you'll see me in two weeks
and matt's standing there and i'm crying i'm not standing there i'm not there at all when
brice got on the plane matt's like you'll see him it'll be okay you're gonna be able to see him as
much as you want never fucking said that you scoundrel stop i never said that how dare you fucking
bullshit complete bullshit listen listen this chick is fucking chick man listen when she gets arrested
you know what she said about me when they first arrested her and immediately interviewed her
but you know remember i told you she suck and says she's not rebecca hawk she was on my name is
rebecca hickey you have the wrong name you have the wrong or you have the wrong person
you guys are she they end up putting her hand on the thing like she for like 45 minutes or an hour
she like denies it till they finally put her hand down on the scanner and then she's like
all right it's me so her first interview with me where about me was cox's meek
he's charismatic he's um he's shy he's not or he's not the kind of person that
he's not aggressive he's i mean she basically paints me as a guy that's just not going to
is not a an aggressive type person or a person that's that's um whatever mean spirit whatever
you want to say yeah then she gets this lawyer with the johnny cocker and law firm oh shit really
and it becomes he's abusive he's manipulative he um forced me to leave my son he forced me to get a
boob job he forced me to you out of your fucking mind i knew you a month you should we had a date on
like a fucking thursday night or a friday night i'm throwing my shit this is when i find out that
the police are cut that the f that i'm going to be arrested by the fbi within the next few days
i'm throwing my stuff into duffel bags she's been calling me all all all day about our date
i'm not answering she walks in my apartment or my my um my house as i'm throwing shit in i'm like
hey what's up and she's like you're not returning calls what are you doing and i was like fuck we
got a date i was like listen uh bad news fbi's coming to arrest me i'm out of here and she says
wait what are you doing you can't leave i love you i want to come with you we have this whole
argument about her son i'm like what are you talking about you got a fucking kid you you can't
fucking i'm leaving i'm going on the run right you can't come with me and she's like no you don't
understand he's going back he was going back to live with his father he basically lived with his
father most of his life she brought him with from from vegas brought him with her she brought him
with her yeah from vegas he'd been picked up twice for like a being around out after like
snuck out of her house after curfew he got caught smoking pot he was failing all of his grades
she's like i can't handle him he's too much he's i'm sending him back to live with his father anyway
she's like you know so she's like look he's going anyway back with his father
and i said look you don't understand i said you're not going to see this fucking kid again
i said even if you see him it'll be for a couple hours and it'll be random if you see him at all
and she's like i don't care i want the money if i can see him every once in a while that's fine
at least i can give him some money at least you know i you know so she's just fucking begging
to come with me she follows me around for two or three days won't leave me alone and looking back
on it the truth is i could have just fucking left her you know but she was like really worried
about it really on me and the truth of matter it was a major mistake to let her come with me
but at the moment i was terrified and i was leaving everybody i knew and everything i knew
behind and that that's a huge fucking step to make for sure and so you know and so i finally just
towards like the last day i said okay look you can come with me you know and looking back on it's
like you should i should have done this i should have you know you got always 2020 signs like you
know it's it's um it was just a major mistake bringing her with me major fucking mistake
and you know and i really should have just left her and and and for more than the reasons that she
ended up just being this bipolar maniac other than just that it was also because of her son
i should have made the decision for her i should have but the truth is i'm going off on the run
i'm terrified but i didn't have to be alone and that's a big thing about going off you're leaving
everybody behind and everything you know behind and you're alone yeah so it's like it would be easier
with her there and so i said all right you can come but i certainly didn't convince her to come
or try and get her to come or ask her to come or ask her to leave her kids because then it turned
into he's abusive he's manipulative he made me get a boob job i mean you out of your fucking mind
i'm not even a boob guy share boobs were fine hey just it's just you know and then they then
they focus in on the whole single mother single mother they don't mention jannah jannah wasn't
single i mean she didn't she didn't have any kids you know i dated tons of women they didn't have
kids didn't have any kids they always see you gotta practically cut this out because i get so
fucking angry about the whole fucking thing it just irritates the johnny cocker law firm
i mean you know what's so funny is that normally i'm very poised about the whole thing like you
know it was my fault that i'm apologetic and i do the whole thing but this this this it's like
being just blatantly lied about it just infuriates me yeah and just and it's just you know
you know and what's so funny is that you know i've talked to her since i've been out right you know
and you know she's like so like how did that conversation go it actually she ended up meeting
some guy in the halfway house they got married she's got another kid she's very nice she's a nice
person like now and even she says i'm like you are a fucking maniac and she she's like i was going
through something okay she's like it was it was a bad time for me she's a much better now
i said i just had i even told her look and i was we were talking about the she told me here
did i tell you this she told me her lawyer showed up drunk for her at her sentencing oh really yeah
she goes she said you know and gail mckinsey and and she's talking you know the u.s attorney she
fucking said this and this and everybody was pushing me to say this and say that matt she's
you understand i was trying to get my sentence reduced so no i understand i said but you know the
problem is now i have to live with it i said so she says well i'm sorry i wish i could do something
if i could do something i would i go you could you could go on the podcast with me i said you
could go on a podcast with me and say what really happened she said oh no no no no no no no no no no
she said i can't do that why she said because i've been telling my mother and my my my husband the
story she said for the last 12 years or 10 years she was no i i can't change now
well hopefully he doesn't see this podcast so and i told her listen i haven't asked her once
bro i've asked her like five fucking times i'm like i'm telling you then tell your husband
go to your husband you have a good relationship she says oh my god he's the best he's amazing he's
a great guy he's great he's great it's a great guy then he'll understand the situation you were in
and you you just ran with it because you didn't want to own up to the fact that you made some
bad fucking decisions so say look the guy's out now and i want to clear the ear and i'll feel so
much better about myself i'll feel better about the situation i want to do the right thing she says
no no no no she ain't coming she says i'm not gonna do that she said look i i can't do that i said
okay well i i said you understand i said at some point if somebody asked me i'm gonna
fucking say it she goes no i understand me he'll she's never gonna meet you she's like as oh she
said i understand so we'll see what she says if i ever talk to her again wow okay
a few days later on december 14th 2003 testament series dubious deals hits the newsstands
the reporter details a fraud worth more than four million dollars but matt cox is gone
he was never seen in tampa again ever the trail went cold for me for a while where cox was i i didn't
know the people who know him best assume he's fled the country they think he's gotten on the
cruise ship and he's headed to uh some island south cox's ex-girlfriend allison arnold is
among those asking questions i always wondered you know what happened to them where are they
allison has not been caught for her role where did they get those photos of you
those photos you weren't like the superman sure and sit on the computer assuming that well i know
the one chick next to me was that on your myspace or something my space was that not around on
no three i don't think that my space was around i mean i was it when was my space around i don't
know i know this chick i met me my space started this 2003 2003 yeah well okay 2003 well i wasn't
on it okay um no uh i would say that's probably allison arnold and probably janna because the
one chick in the picture where i have a superman thing and she has one that's janna okay one
of cox's scams six months earlier she poses as rosita perez and takes out fraudulent home loans
though the police have not yet come knocking on her door allison is worried she knows the heat's on
i was a nervous wreck i got a job as a waitress because i couldn't work for any bank my hands
would shake my conscious was so heavy allison decides to call the fbi so i spilled my guts out
said everything allison tells the feds everything she knows to help them catch cox allison thinks
her cooperation will buy her immunity from prosecution how wrong eventually she's sentenced
to two years in prison for bank fraud you want to hear this you want to hear this yeah you're gonna
love this so there's like 14 or 15 people on on the indictment right so they've all been indicted
but the fbi doesn't do anything they're waiting to catch me they've talked to a bunch of people
everybody's going in and saying matt did this matt did that some people are going and saying no so
and so did this so and so did this so and they're saying no i didn't do that so and so so everybody's
pointing but they've got they understand everybody who's involved because by the time they talked to
me they're they've walking with a stack of fucking three or two boom they're like i mean you're done
so which i know i'm done anyway so the point is is that they haven't they haven't invested
they haven't arrested anybody you've known about this for six months or so you haven't done anything
why aren't you arresting they're waiting to catch me because they figure we'll catch cox
we'll catch the top dog he'll just explain everything that happened we'll crack everybody in
the head and it'll be fine right they don't expect that i'm gonna be missing so long allison
is riddled with guilt and she well fear she's like fuck they're gonna come arrest me someday right
so she goes into the fbi and says i just want to tell you what happened get charged be sentenced
and be done with it i'll cooperate against everybody she initially when she talked to
she is thinking i won't go to jail i'll do probation at the most yeah and i'll cooperate
so she goes in she cooperates she agrees to plead guilty turns herself in just walks right in
nobody else does guess who the only person that ends up like on that indictment that ends up going
to prison is the only person that owns up to everything they did cooperates against everyone
straight to fricking prison you don't get shit fuck you you go to prison that's what they
fucking did everybody else on the indictment no half them people are still working in banking
wow no and that i mean i don't want to say hilarious but fucked up that's fucked up
because you know the least that the the least culpable person in my entire indictment
is allison arnold really she walked into one bank two closings didn't make a fucking i think
maybe i gave her felt i gave her like ten grand for doing it like hey look you know we really
didn't really make any money but here's like ten grand or something and i'd been giving her money
and she's closing loans she's doing okay but we didn't make any money so where's the money to give
you there's nothing to give you what about the blonde girl how much time did she get
oh um becky becky wasn't a part of this conspiracy she's a part of the next conspiracy when i
take off on the run so she's not even on my indictment oh shit okay right the only other
person that goes to jail is um is eric tomargo but he goes to jail not because of the indictment
he goes to jail because he's already on federal probation and he fails a fucking piss test
and because he's on this other indictment they go ahead and they violate his probation
and give him like 30 months or something he goes to call him and he does the drug program
so i mean she's the only one on the indictment that goes to prison for the indictment he goes to
one on a violation she because she felt bad guilty conscience guilty conscience i mean and you
know it's just the nicest person you know so half-decentance for somebody who had no previous
criminal records really i had no knowledge of everything that i was totally doing but i followed
along and did something yes and i know it was a legal yes you know everybody knows that right
and wrong inside but i just i didn't think the consequences would be like this while allison
faces prison matt cox and rebecca hawk head to atlanta by this point i was definitely getting
cocky when american greed returns matt cox lives out a real life game of catch me if you can
that's true
what this is great this is not this isn't even on youtube i don't think this thing
oh no oh no no yeah this is gonna be no there's not that's the guys are in the comments are
somebody needs to get in post it matt cox and his girlfriend rebecca hawk are on the run
cox has swindled more than four million dollars from banks in tampa in a mortgage fraud scam
and he's hungry for more hungry so we went straight to atlanta there's the mortgage fraud capital of
what atlanta is one of the hardest hit cities by mortgage fraud probably for maybe it's about to get
worse i fell for some hope so hard and so fast he just made you think that it was no big deal that
you know what he was doing was fine and then he would say if it ever comes to it just blame me
you know you won't you won't get you i'll take the blame for everything cox and hawk go looking for a
house to rent with a plan to take over the homeowner's identity i remember this story he used to tell me
that people believed women more than they believed men hawk using the name grace hudson poses as a
single woman looking to rent this house at alfredo so how did you go about making that
the the the older id really the new id is that all with like that's fucking laminate bro that's just
laminate the piece of laminate an exacto knife and a printer or a printer machine yeah my laptop
i did you have photoshop back then they had we had we had this conversation they had photoshop
they've had photoshop but i just use word and i just lined up everything was identical i lined up
all the fonts all the spacings everything exactly the way it would be when you printed out on license
on word on word then i just printed out on a piece of laminate in reverse okay so that then
when you have the actual driver the actual piece of plastic i would just take 220 grit sandpaper and
lightly sand off the actual in from the text like your real name so i have the holograms i have the
florida id where it says florida florida florida that whole thing i have your picture i have everything
the state of uh the uh the state of uh the sunshine state and all that everything in green is lodged
into the actual right that's what you left on there you didn't sand that off no everything black
you sand it off just just yeah just the information right like i would leave the other stuff like
your issue day expiration height all that shit signature no signature i would have to see you'd
have to sign like hers is grace huson okay so i would then print the laminate overlay it
glue it on with an actual glue stick now you got the piece of plastic with the thing flip it over
take an exacto knife an exacto knife around take some 220 220 grit sandpaper buff off the sides
hit it a couple of times beat it up a little bit like any license you've gotten your pocket for
six months it's beat up a little bit and then now you can go in and say boom boom million bucks
here's here's my name and they look at it and they make a copy and they you know even if they ran
the net the number would work like you could go through check systems open bank account i've had
dozens and dozens or does i've had a shitload of fucking banks opened using a fake driver's license
guys names wrong just completely fabricated how many of these did you create in your entire career
you think maybe like that yeah 20 or 30 i mean because then i eventually figured out how to just
get the dmv to issue me the goddamn license right i'm just gonna get you to just just make it because
then i can go i can get pulled over by the cops and hand them the real license you can run it yeah
yeah why would i why would i keep making them way easier yeah poses as a single woman looking to
rent this house in alpharetta a suburb of atlanta she meets with the owner michael shanahan
he and i talked for a while and he was you know he was very nice and it and that was a heart
because he was the only person that i really met face to face grace hudson rebecca's alias
rents the home and matt cox takes over the landlord's identity what i did was i i used a
child social security number and i went and got some credit cards in his name went open something
by the way which child was it it was a child of i was a family renting it before you or what child
no no you said you used a child social security number i may i went to social security right and
i got them to issue a social security number to a child that was 10 months old oh got it so it's
a child it's a fake child it's not a real child right and i would then i would mirror it so i'd
pull get credit cards in the name of that with that soche in the name michael shanahan i've got
your driver's license the driver's license that the the date of birth and everything matches
everything matches right and i've got these these uh credit cards and everything issued to you i open
up a bank account in your name i open up everything in your name now i'm it's completely synthetic
identity because the only thing that's the same is the name everything else was different on him
date of birth address because i wasn't using that address i used another address because when we
borrowed money on that house we didn't borrow it as a owner occupied property we borrowed it as a
rental property because then they'll issue the check right away and hard money guys don't typically
lend money on owner occupied properties they prefer to lend money on investment properties why is that
i have no idea it has something to do with the lending and the ability to foreclose on it you
foreclose on investment property if they're living in it it's hard to foreclose on way more
difficult okay it counts uh hoping that none of this would hit michael shanahan's credit
now posing as michael shanahan the owner of this two hundred thousand dollar house cox goes looking
for money well i met uh the fellow calling himself michael shanahan in the at the front door here
john holman is not a faceless bank he lends his own hard-earned money to people who need
short-term loans i was there primarily to see the condition of the house at the time it didn't
occur to me to wonder about his identity or anything to that effect cox posing as michael
shanahan tells holman he wants to borrow money against the equity in his home the man seems
trustworthy and the home is good collateral the story was that he owned a house free and clear
and wanted to borrow money against it to start a business he had just moved back from the uk
wanted to start a business and needed a hundred and ten thousand dollars or so i bought it hook
line and sinker within a couple of weeks the deal is done holman has no idea cox is also talking to
a friend of his on what they call a hard money lender like lend money mostly to other investors
buying properties to renovate and resell sucker and there he wants a hundred and six thousand
dollars to start a bank there's a they don't interview the bank shanahan seems like a sure thing
it was a fifty percent loan to value loan up in alpharetta georgia in a beautiful neighborhood
very low risk both lenders do their homework holman runs a title check on the house and a
background check on shanahan at the closing we got his id and he had actually more than
the normal id he had a florida driver's license he had a credit card and a social security card
all in the name uh michael shanahan so everything checked out and we made the loan thinking that
we had secure interest in the property a month later peter st martin realizes michael shanahan
has missed his first loan payment uh-oh he's gone by then i pulled out like a month later like 400
thousand yeah within a month yeah yeah we can that's the one where i actually were in the bank
they go uh when i was pulling i was trying to cash one of the checks is scott cognow and they
fucking they're running a check and everything remember like i was 29 000 check i was trying to
oh yeah and you called them from and they and well they called me on my phone they they're like hey
we're trying to verify this i should verify my own check um that was there is in the book right
okay so um yeah and so i end up getting out of like four like four hundred thousand dollars
betki and i get out from four hundred thousand and week within weeks and we just take off like i
didn't know i didn't know these two guys know each other the fucking chances are that i mean how am i
supposed to know so anyway yeah this is when the secret service gets involved oh shit but neither
man is worried each thinks he's the first in line to foreclose if necessary and i'm happy about it
and i'm looking forward to taking back this collateral and selling it very quickly at a very
nice profit although we don't do these loans with the purpose for getting the house back it's not
necessarily a disaster for us but matt cox will have the last laugh that's why i remember pretty
similar to that but i remember a short time later the two friends are at a concert together and they
begin to compare notes kind of saying well where is your property you know because you do most so
john i were chatting and mentioned that yeah we did this long you're not gonna you know this guy
first month of fall blah blah blah i don't know what rang a familiar bell there but i asked peter
what street was the loan on my mind was keying hand and you're like oh no i said uh-oh it's the same
property same address and i said what was the guy's name and he said michael shanahan and you said i said
uh-oh unbelievable well and the fact that he borrowed money from you and me we both know each
other in small world i sat there during the rest of that concert thinking that i was probably out
$110,000 and not real happy about it john holman calls the u.s attorney did you say the insurance
companies paid them back here he says the one guy he says you already got paid back he's one of the
guys the one guy the gray hair the gray hair he shows up in my sentencing really sure he's the
guy he's the one that showed up shows up in my sentencing and my u.s attorney is like you know
mr. Holmes or whatever his name is um he uh he's mr. cock stole $110,000 from from him and he
they that was his own money and he you know this is all he does by this guy's like a multi-millionaire
plus he's got a credit line so i mean it's not like he works at 711 um anyway he he you know
stole his money and he couldn't afford to lose that much money and you never got any of that money
back did you and he goes this is in front of the judge at my sentence and he goes um uh actually
i did get the money back and she goes what what he said i did get the money back she goes
when when did you get the money back i mean this is the fucking courtroom there's fucking reporters
stop judging me so anyway there's reporters and the fucking judge and they're having this
conversation it's like a fucking hundred people in the fucking thing and he and he was like we
i did get the money back and she's like well when and he's like it was it was uh shortly after
you know month or two later i i got it back and she goes well well what about the payments he missed
he was no no i got the payments back too what do well you must be out something she's like no i got
i got everything back she goes what about well what about an attorney's fees anything oh no no
he was i did i did have to pay some attorneys fees he was that was about $1500 yeah yeah i did pay
some attorneys fees and she's $1500 she was well that's a lot of money she says you couldn't afford
to lose that could you and he goes um no no i couldn't i couldn't lose there was a lot of money to me
and it's like it's like bro i mean oh my god i mean not that it's not fucked up what i did not
that it's not that but you know it's it she was just they're desperate to fucking make you look as
bad as they possibly can yeah and he got paid back yeah from the title insurance one of the guys
one of the guys well no the other guy gets paid back too okay he just doesn't get paid back
during this episode he's been paid back okay he's not on my i don't owe him money he's not a part of
my fucking um my restitution because he was paid back and who paid him back the title insurance
i said his insurance the title insurance yeah company is on my restitution i owe them the money
so it's like if you say oh you stole half a million dollars or two million dollars from bank of america
500 000 or 50 000 from bank of america it's like yeah but bank of america got paid back
so why are you saying bank of america because who i really owe is lawyer's title they paid him back
but see that's too complicated so it's easier to say you stole this money from me you i never got
paid u o bank of america u o john so and so well actually i don't owe him anything so but go ahead
sorry attorney's office in atlanta and the case is routed to the u.s secret service the secret
service isn't just in the west wing of the white house more and more they're taking on white collar
crime we we protect the president and former presidents but we also deal with any kind of
financial crime anything that affects the um financial infrastructure of the united states
special agent andrea peacock doesn't know who michael shanahan and graze hudson really are
it was john and jane doe and when we obtained our initial warrants john and jane doe they were in
the name of john and jane doe the secret service creates a wanted poster and eventually tracks down
a former associate of cox's in tampa he did in fact know who he was and told us his name was matthew
bevin cox he's a real guy agent peacock learns that matt cox has taken out three loans on shanahan's
property for a total take of more than 300 000 dollars peter st martin is out of luck
his title insurance will not cover the loss you know 106 000 loss overnight to a small business
that could have easily put me out of business at that time it hurts that hurts badly that
i don't have access to that money agent peacock talks to the real michael shanahan
who realizes he's a victim of identity theft credit cards and checking accounts have been
taken out in his name and then there's the statue that cox left behind at shanahan's house oh yeah
pours salt in his wounds you dirt bag listen man i'm listen let me tell you about the statue
that that is listen fraud's not a full-time thing okay it's if we fucking a lot of down time we're
doing rock climbing we're fucking we're going hiking we're jogging we're running we're just
fucking we're doing anything to so i make this paper mache statue of a man screaming
in agony screaming in i have nothing to do with like he's on fire or something what are you doing
what are you doing i'm just pointing it out i'm just saying it's a it's a statue anyway so what
happens is when i when i we go to leave and we're packing up our stuff i can't fit the statue
in the fucking car or in the the the the van that we've got yeah so i have to leave the we even we
took out the talking to them i'm sorry we take out the back thing like the back seat yeah we can't
pack everything in so bet he's like we're gonna have to leave it we have a big like astro van or
something you're like a mini van like a mini van it's like a like a honda element or something
okay so i have to leave it so i leave it and i we leave the back
um the the the back seat in the garage when i when this guy shows up at my sentencing
he says that one we trashed the house i'm not sure how we trashed the house we had the carpets
cleaned it was in as good a shape as it was when we left i mean when we moved in i only had a bedroom
set we didn't buy furniture we had nothing we had a fucking bedroom set and and it's just the two
of us we'd been there a month or so i mean we've been there a few months so this thing i leave in
the garage he says i left it in the living room and that when he walked in the house it was in the
living room and the whole house was trashed trashed with what we don't have anything it wasn't
trashed and it was in the garage not that i'm saying what i did was right what i'm saying is
it's always like it's like i always picture him like hiking it in and sitting it down and
staging the whole thing to you know and like a trashing that it wasn't trashed but
anyway yeah but the the statue so it's he turns it into it was he was taunting me he was
taunting you bro you think i i worked fucking hours and hours you think i didn't
right you think i didn't want to bring my statue i actually would love to redo that statue
you should i never an auction it off that would be great okay sorry all right let's go he told me
that he felt like he was leaving it behind on purpose because that was the way he felt when
he saw that statue realized what cox had done to him he felt like he was mocking him that's that's
i do owe him money he'd want to leave he paid he had to pay an attorney he ended up having to pay
an attorney like four thousand dollars um and the attorney contacted all the title insurance companies
and had them pay off all the you know those loans got paid off and everything so and those got those
guys so instead of just him calling and talking to the two guys that they just interviewed like hey
look what have you okay my name's i'm not really michael i'm michael the real michael shanahan
here's what happened instead of doing that he hired an attorney that did all that for him
and that was about four grand okay and i owe him that um documents just as a trail to see this is
what i've done he's just like try and catch me you can't flush with cash cox and hawk go on a
spending spree i went from having absolutely no money to having money and even now i think god
i wasted a lot of money on nonsense the chick has been survived hawk is obsessed with clothes and jewelry
matt cox is all about fast cars and rest implants i didn't i didn't need them i mean i was fine
everything was fine like i said no complaints whatsoever from anybody else but he was always
wanted this kind of trophy person and of course me i'm like yes if this is going to make you happy
let me you know let me do this what are you serious i could let the first of all she already had
fucking boobs i don't understand what the it's it's she got a boob job that she got a boob job and
and she look you know what happened motherfucker listen we we ended up stealing a bunch of money
she you know what no this is when she got it that's true we we got a bunch of money
and so i was gonna have 400 and change right yeah it was it was it was almost 400 000 roughly
they said 300 000 it was like 400 um i said look i'm gonna get this done yeah you know i'm gonna get
fucking rhino pla i'm gonna get my fucking nose done i'm gonna get a fucking facelift i'm gonna
get i'm gonna get a bunch of shit done just because it ain't good bro my fucking pictures everywhere
we're they got all kinds of shit happening i you're turning on now we're going on the internet
this fucking my picture is everywhere now not that you're gonna find me because you don't you
don't know my name but it's bad so i was like i'm gonna fucking change this and this and then she
goes she's like i want i want a fucking boob job i'm like fuck yeah if you want a boob job get a
boob job i give a shit i don't even want to be around this fucking broad she's driving me nuts
so she's she's bipolar she wouldn't take the medication she gets on the medication a couple
times she gets the cops called on me multiple times because she's screaming at two o'clock in the
morning she's a fucking lunatic so she said she she would take the medication for like a month and
it would start to work and then she would get off it because she said i felt like well i would i'm
okay now okay night because you're taking the medication but she didn't like the way it made
her feel and it was the only thing keeping her sane got it so so this is the point where you go
and spend a shitload of money getting your face all remodeled with right so i get the hair thing
done so that's why i don't have that receding hairline and the nose job because my nose was round
real round and um she'd got fucking some some some leg implants or something some fucking
you know i looked i looked into it but but she would have had to have watched me for like three
months i can't have her watching me you would have been immobilized are you serious you saw
misery right i mean i can't have her watching me she'd fucking come in with a baseball bat or
something and beat my absolutely not i mean you don't know she look you look at her right now
thinking oh she looks she's cute she's sweet she's a fucking lunatic um so yeah did not ask her to
get a boob job but to be honest they did do excellent work it was it was it was a swan institute
in yeah and and it's called the swan institute and uh in uh in atlanta they did they did excellent
good i'm just saying in general i said firm yeah they were nice you know they were you know even
and so i ended up going to the doctor and getting that done matcox treats his girlfriend's body as
a canvas he can paint or twist to fit his fantasies fucker he does the same with his own appearance
when we left um he got obsessed with the way he looked and how his physique was and stuff like
that i mean he went he hardly ever ate he had a nose job done lipo done under here he had it done on
his side so he had yeah he had a lot of surgeries all of it of course is paid with money stolen
from his victims i don't know what would motivate someone to do that greed is the first thing that
you think of uh but there was more than greed i think there was a big dose of ego involved in
this crime for this particular individual it was the rush it was the thrill of the chase
and he thought he could get away with it forever at that point i really did i thought
they'll never catch me an american greed returns see how the law catches up with cox i'm freaking out
and how cox escapes
it's eating up what are you gonna call this what should we call it i don't know you got any ideas
if something american greed you gotta do something with american greed the actual the american greed
episode yeah something narrated by yours truly not to be cox
secret service special agent andrea peacock is on the tail of matt cox and rebecca hawk
two of the most wanted financial fugitives but the secret service is never sure where they are
or what names they're using it was impossible to predict what identity he would use next
cox has as many as 50 aliases and they have all of them
philip daniel morgan corbin blair thomas matthew bevan cox it's not an alien jerald scott kugler
walter andrew hawkham richard paul grohockey jr james franklin pague
did they do joseph carter like joseph carter i don't like them
where bridget brown and her husband are trying to sell their home
well this is a flyer that the realtor produced to show our home when we were trying to sell it
shows a quintessential suburban neighborhood and little house on a pond try as they may
the home won't sell it was a stressful time because i was traveling weekly to august already
with my son for his surgical treatments their son colby is sick and they need to move closer to care
in august and georgia of no idea the old house continues i didn't know they had a sick son
until an article came out a year later a friend of ours recommended that we offer owner financing
and said that that would make the home competitive and also open it up to people that previously
could not have afforded a conventional loan just one week after the browns offer owner financing
the phone rings that night it was gary sullivan or the man we thought was gary sullivan came and
viewed the home matt cox has a new alias it was there i i never talked to her or the husband until
the day of we went to closing what happened was i had hired an attorney i'd hired a realt not hired
i got a realtor yeah we went to a bunch of different properties and i put and properties
that people were willing to owner finance so i would walk in the the property i look around i say
okay great what do they want for it 110 000 put 110 000 contract on it and they go okay i want
them to owner finance it 10 percent down no problem i leave i put a half a dozen contracts out okay
one of the i got two houses got a house for 110 000 which i borrowed like 90 several about four
or five loans for around 90 95 thousand dollars on like half a million like three four hundred
thousand dollars on uh on one house their house was going for 224 225 so i go in i walk in i look
at the house i go great how much they want 220 let's say 225 225 000 i say okay great put a contract
in i'll put 10 percent down they go okay no problem but they gotta owner finance it no problem
so they call me back realtor calls back hey well uh um how's this gonna work i talked to the realtor
for a little bit here i'll do this i'll do this i'll do this put 10 percent down he goes okay no
problem he calls back and says they'll do it it's a little bit longer dragged out the phone calls
a little bit longer but whatever within a few hours like that night like after i see the house
like then that that night the next night i gotta they're ready to sign a contract okay i've never
talked to him okay i don't know anything about any sick child nobody was there she says at one point
she says that like she was there when i walked in and rebecca hulk walked in but i had a male
realtor that walked in with me and no one was in the home nobody was there so maybe she's miss
remembering it i don't know just like she said i called her i didn't call you had a realtor you
call her a liar i'm saying that's not what happened i don't know what she's saying i'm saying i talked
to my realtor my realtor talked to their realtor their realtor at some point contacted me i never
talked first of all if you have a realtor you don't talk to the buyer you talk the realtors are
talking that's what you're paying them for you're not talking to them never talk to her till the
day of the closing so then we have the day of the closing and i walk in this part i do remember
because she said this a few times i walk in we all meet hi how are you
one of the things they they wanted me to do was to write out all the all uh like 18 months with
the checks or something like a year's worth of checks so they just deposit them and i had suggested
that so i write all the checks out jamie favorite marcia whatever here and she says and as we're
talking i remember her saying um she was joking around about we said something and when i was
talking to her i had an in the braces i said i'm sorry i have these braces in and i like
pop them out and she goes oh you got where your teeth messed up i go out there a little bit
tweaked i just trying to fix them up i said you know i made a crack i said listen when you're
five foot six i said everything's got to be perfect i said the hair the face the teeth the
wardrobe the bank account everything she starts laughing um and i remember her her husband was
like he's like six foot tall i go i go mr dot who was a doctor doctor brown i go doctor brown
wouldn't know anything about that and she starts she looked at him and laughed and uh so i write
the checks and she says something about when we give out the document like we give out our
driver's license she says something about oh yeah something something yeah i had my identity
stolen one time and i like looked at her like like what you like fuck and i was like oh okay
really and she's like yeah and i'm sitting there but i remember thinking just the idea that she
had said it yeah and then she says it one in one of these interviews somewhere maybe not this one
one of them she says he looked at me with this shocked look on his face like when i mentioned
that my identity been sold something like that anyway so we we all signed the documents i give
them the 25 my 10 down which was like 25 grand and uh and i leave i make a few payments i satisfied
alone i borrow like a million dollars or so on their house i pull out the money you know i get
caught in the bank the whole you know the whole thing um a year and a half year about a year later
fortune magazine comes out and it says that i stalked them because i knew that they had a sick
child and they were desperate to sell the house i didn't know you were desperate i didn't know you
had a sick child i didn't know you i was driven around by a realtor i put a contract out on a
contract on the house i borrowed the money what i did was wrong i absolutely went to prison for that
i am sorry for that i i owe them she's gonna say that i i like stole 200 000 from them or something
no i didn't you had a mortgage on the house for 200 and 1000 dollars is what you owed
sold the house for 225 i put down 25 000 you own a finance 200 000 you had what's called a wraparound
mortgage you i make payments to them they make payments to their lender you didn't have any equity
you were getting money to pay your two i owe you 200 000 in equity that you don't possess because
the equity is actually held by the by the lender right so i'm paying you you're paying the lender
you don't have any equity you already owe 200 000 now i want you to balance like you just
go back to paying their own mortgage right so well they could foreclose i um they can still
foreclose on they can foreclose on me take that they did foreclose they foreclosed took the house
back and resold the house oh shit okay but i do owe them about 10 grand because they they hired an
attorney to because i i encompassed their their title so i absolutely owe them owe them the 10
thousand they're they're on my on my restitution payment for 10 grand that's what i owe them okay
but here she says oh he took i think i think she says i i stole 200 000 from her something but you
didn't have 2000 200 000 in equity that's it's just one of those things is tweaked not that what i did
wasn't wrong it's just one of those things that they they just a little bit here just enough to make
you a you know like i've said before it's like me arguing the point is like saying i didn't murder
10 people i only murdered seven yeah it's okay well i'm still a scumbag i'm not saying nobody's
saying i'm not a scumbag i'm just saying i didn't murder 10 people i murdered seven which is why
we're doing this my bad gary sullivan is actually a homeless person cox met on a trip to las vegas
that's true gary sullivan was you know a 20 male prostitute uh hopped out and told him i was doing
a survey for the salvation army paid 20 bucks he could he answer 17 if you want the long version
of the story go watch the first layer the first podcast yeah that we did with matt you ought to

50 podcast no it's like 40 something was it really that's 43 or something and you know the thing in
and look hey here's the thing too and that podcast is maybe 50 percent of the story i mean the the
whole story i write the whole fucking story so you really know how how i did this what i did that the
whole thing oh it's number 40 number 40 podcast number 40 was the first one we did that's where
you told all of the story about yeah going to los vegas what the fuck we're on like we're on like
56 are you still you're buying it you're buying me dinner you gotta buy me what are you talking about

all the nba games i'm not broken up about that i don't watch sports so yeah nba that's pretty big time
i mean that's a big fucking deal there's a lot of money in the nba yeah well i'm starving by the way
yeah anyway questions he said no problem this is a scam cox does again and again he would um take
this form that he created that he you know titled a federal statistical survey tried to make it look
from you know official form number in the small print it has us government printer office and he'd
asked for you know full name at birth you know their mother's maiden name um father's name so
security had they ever been arrested um any kind of information that could affect when i was being
using that identity when i was being interviewed by her and the and the uh u.s attorney they asked
me where i got the form and i what do you mean they go well this is a government form where did
you get it and i went did you download it and i went no it's not a government before they go it says
it's a government form right here like they're like like angry every time i ever said anything
that was true that they disagree with they get angry what this says it right here i was like
no that's not i made the form i got the fucking look i got the logo here i got the and they were
always like they really i was oh you know i was so shocked i was just like but by the time you're
done with the interview you realize you just don't know anything yeah i thought i really
thought i was gonna walk in and they had it all laid out and they knew everything but they really
don't they they know bits and pieces so but yeah the the the form was uh completely fabricated
yeah he gives the con man everything he needs to create a new identity i ordered his social security
card i ordered everything with his identity secured as gary selivan cox learns about the
brown's home and moves in for the kill he was very unassuming very demure kind of quiet the con man
cracks jokes at his own expense he talks about the braces he just had put on his and he said when
you're short as i am you don't have much to go with so everything has to be perfect the con man
is so good rigid brown feels sorry for him and we knew from what we were told that he had a bad
credit history so i was concerned that you know he may be in county going into that situation again
yet i wasn't thinking that this was a criminal mastermind that was really playing us i just
thought this is a young man who's very insecure and and trying hard here even now i get upset for
the fact that these people have worked all their lives and we come in and just you know with the
and they want to believe you everybody wants to believe someone they don't want them to think that
you know you're gonna cheat them out of their you know their life savings or whatever and that's what
we did it's not what happens the browns think they've closed the book on their housing crisis
they're wrong a lender referred for referred him to me for a closing
mary knell degenhardt is a real estate attorney in columbia south carolina a few days after
representing gary sullivan at another closing she talks to an abstractor someone who researches
a property's title she said your your mortgage is recorded in first position but there's four or five
right behind you within two days on the same property i knew then what he had done he had
refinanced with several different attorneys and there's a lag time at the county so you would
have never seen the mortgage until they hit all at once it's too late the mortgage checks you know
you know many times how many people in the guys in the uh comment section let's say like that's not
possible you can't do that the banks that well that's a title that that's a title person right
there just told you that that's very possible and matt cox has taken 1.2 million dollars on a 200
thousand dollar house 1.2 million houses that's their house and another house their house i didn't
get 1.2 i got like 400 i got like 900 thousand or something like on theirs and i got like 400
thousand another because the total was like 1.3 million right but it was two different houses
okay i mean it's just one of those things like they decided they they must have said oh we'll
fucking add it together we'll stretch that we'll just add it together we'll stretch that tree too
complicated okay let's just keep which is fine it's still more entertaining that's fine the banks in
town immediately i believe what coby was the one that put a uh a fraud alert out through the system
it was bad bro on march 4th 2005 gary sullivan strolls into a vakovia bank in columbia south
carolina to withdraw money the bank teller sees that a fraud alert has been issued on this name
within i thought you had plastic surgery down at this point no no i hadn't done the hair thing
the hair yet but you had the nose job no no no i hadn't had it done yet oh okay i thought you did
minutes deputy sheriffs arrived and asked gary sullivan to come downtown yeah i think i had the
nose i'm freaking out so then then i go and uh the investigator shows up and he's arguing
with the guy from vakovia and we're arguing back and forth yeah i had it done by i convinced him
except for the hair nothing illegal about taking out multiple loans on the same house
up now i remember this story from podcast number four yeah yeah from podcast number 40
also your book also in the book you gotta buy the book can matt cox talk his way out this time
for more information and web exclusives on the crimes of matt cox
go to american greed dot c m c dot cox acts that go to inside true crime dot com fuckers
how much more time
matt cox the financial fugitive is stopped at a bank in columbia south carolina
he was at the teller and the cops came in and handcuffed him and said come with me and
he was like oh crap i'm freaking out cox goes downtown to the sheriff's department
they let him drive his car and that's what he called me he goes you made this is bad he's like
they're here they picked me up at this point they don't know he's matthew cox they think he's
gary sullivan the homeless person cox steals the identity of a street person and takes out one
point this is where she says i'm not bailing you out fuck you you said well they fuck you but
yes he's like i'm better not get arrested like fuck two million dollars worth of loans on a house
worth about two hundred thousand dollars at the bank cox is trying to withdraw some of his fraudulent
proceeds so they took him into a room and he talked his way out of it he told the guy it's a i have a
second and third on my home that's that's illegal i convinced him that there's nothing illegal about
taking out multiple loans on the same house when the richland county sheriff's department
runs a criminal history for gary sullivan they see no warrants for his arrest the local police
at this point usually wouldn't make an immediate arrest unless someone was wanted and of course
they ran the um identity that cox was using but that person was not wanted gary sullivan was not
wanted the police in columbia had him dead to rights but they didn't have the paperwork and
they weren't certain who they were dealing with and he talked his way out of the situation and was gone
in columbia bridget brown gets a knee that fucker on a podcast to give his side of the story
called from the secret service she and her husband go back to their home i've talked to him if you
gary sullivan of course is long gone on the kitchen countertop was a fax machine on it was uh
just tons of spilling out of mortgage applications for home equity loans these were just some
examples of the infamous loan applications that we found in our house that's actually where he had
forged our names and but tomato tomato that he had paid us off and wanted to take the money and run
in essence the browns now have seven mortgages on their home it will take them more than a year
to clear the title cox and hawk take their 1.2 million and flee to houston but life as bonnie
and clad is losing its peer we used to fight all the time we used to scream and yell at each other
all the time it was like hell being with her and after we left she blamed everything on me
what have i done why have i left why did i look how dramatic these camera angles are can you
appreciate this b-roll they went out of their way to go to a motel room fuck it all up and then shoot
these insane camera angles and we we didn't live in them oh you know i was in houston for less than
24 hours she had moved there first she rented a place in a post apartments like fucking way up on
like the 20th floor or something i mean had an amazing apartment in not a penthouse but whatever
wait it was up there in um in houston i went there right after i got caught we get into this huge
fucking argument she gives me a hundred thousand dollars out of like six hundred thousand dollars
she gives me like a hundred grand i take the fucking hundred grand i take off i go back to
charlotte to pick up my car charlotte north north carolina that's where i almost get grabbed by the
fucking us at us on marshals remember i told you this at the starbucks yeah but yeah so i was never
i was there for they may sound like we hung out there so i didn't hang out there and on top of
that all this b-roll is bullshit that's not the fuck that's our hotel room sells it man it really
does sell it makes good for good tv it's pretty fucking terrible b-roll though but i guess this
was put out in fucking yeah well they weren't sophisticated like you are well i'm not sophisticated
i guess the style has just changed yeah i just probably do that better b-roll so why if she had
six hundred grand why would you even accept her only taking a hundred grand and giving her a half
million dollars and she fucking she was because she had a one she was like if you like she didn't
want to give me anything but she wanted me like ten grand so i'm arguing and she finally said look
i'll give you a hundred thousand dollars i was saying split the money she's saying ten grand i
can't believe in you i can't believe you even well first of all because she was saying about accepting
half here's what she's saying she's saying that if i don't we don't we have to you are gonna be okay
with this because if you because i was saying look i'll take all the fucking money if you don't split
it you'll you'll have nothing she goes and where are you gonna go with that she was you're using a
driver's license that they already know who they're looking for this guy gary solomon was all the
driver's license i only when i had they're like you got oh i had a michael ecker one too so they
know mic who michael ecker it is by now too they're like you're driving a you you're driving a rider
truck in the name of a guy that they're going to be looking for because if you take all the money
i'll call the police and they'll be looking for that rider truck in his name um um how many miles
500 a thousand miles away from uh or a couple thousand miles away from charlotte north carolina
i've got to go back there to get my car which is also in the name of a guy they're looking for
but at least it's not the rider truck oh you know all my fake ids when i i drove the rider truck
there to to move my apartment there all my stuff because we lived in two separate houses at this
point we she had her own fucking apartment i had my own apartment she had moved her apartment to
houston so now i'm picking up packing up my stuff and moving that we put all my stuff in a storage
unit along with my ids so i couldn't even go and say fuck you and grab all my i all the all my ids
that i had collected they're in her storage unit so i'm just fucked i've got two ids with me that
they're looking for in a rider truck so we're we're arguing and i'm she i'm saying i'll take
all the money she's saying and what where are you gonna go in the rider truck they're looking for
even if you have all the fucking money she's like i'll make one call here's the thing if i was this
brutal angry manipulative guy i'd have just beaten her ass or something or choked her to death
something instead i'm sitting there like practically begging her you got to give me
something what are you i can't leave with ten grand what am i gonna but she did have a powerful
argument which was this she said look i can't do what you do you'll take the hundred thousand
you'll turn it into a couple million very quickly i'm gonna have to live off this money for the
rest of my life and she was right she wasn't she wasn't she's not a con she's not a grifter she's
not going to be able to survive i didn't think she'd be able to go very long at all i was amazed
she would last a year and i remember thinking she's right i'll take the money i'll make a
bunch more money and i did very quickly i had a few million dollars very quickly makes sense so i
just grabbed the money and left i have my biggest problem is i'm driving i got no id i cannot get
pulled over yeah i do this oh my gosh what have i left my son rebecca hasn't seen her son in more
than a year that's not true that's fucked up that's not true why because when we went to vegas
we saw her son really we stopped we gave her son money we gave her fucking parents money we gave
her ex-husband money we give everybody money and by the way when they catch her she didn't give
him all the money she got a whole bunch of money she told me that she had fucking money she had
left the money with the guy she's fucking banging she told me all the she told me what really happened
so i'm like damn oh she fucking she's she did pretty good anyway but yeah she had seen her son
we went there and and she she saw her son like i like hung out and she saw her son for like half
a day like six or seven hours then she called me i picked her up then we bought a bunch of
fucking presents and gifts she left him money she left the husband i actually gave the the ex-husband
money i actually met him at his job 30 grand yeah we she gave her family money she gave her her
son was actually staying with her mother like we would just happen to drive by her mom the ex-husband
30 grand because you know he's taking care of the kid she's not like she's paying her mother was taking
care of the kid you just said she was the kid was staying with her mom for the weekend bro they all
live like like he was living with no like a couple miles he was staying at the grandmother's house
for the weekend there you know okay so so we happened to she's like oh let's drive by my mom's
house and as we're driving by the mother's house she's like holy she's like oh my god there's Bryce
he's playing in the front yard and i was like fuck you wanted to see him i go do you want to stop
here because we were gonna go buy the husband's house to see him to see him because i'd already
dropped off money at the husbands so i was like and i told the husband he gave me his phone number
and everything and i was gonna we were gonna set up a time and i was like fuck if you want to see
Bryce you do it right now this guy's not getting off work for like fucking six or eight hours we
do it right now and she's like i go it's perfect because nobody expects it he's there so i pull
over i let her out she walks in she calls me and says i'm good you can go i go down the street i
hang out for like five or six hours till eventually she calls me calls me every like hour or so
eventually she calls me says okay i'm ready i go by i pick her up then we end up meeting the
husband again we give him a bunch of we buy a bunch of toys and i mean you know look it's a shitty
thing but it's like the least you can do like her son's like look i want this i want this i want
this so we go we spend a couple grand and buy him all these toys and all this stuff he wants
come back we drop it off with the fucking husband with the ex-husband you know i mean
it's it's a shitty situation but the whole i hadn't seen my hunt my son and this that's not
sure sob story edwin alive so sad and then there's the pressure from the secret service cox
googles himself constantly he knows the secret services working with the media to get their
faces in front of as many people as possible rebecca hawk can't stand the heat we were on tv
this us secret service was doing a press conference about us they had done our pictures of warrant
pictures and i just freaked out i'm like no we gotta leave we have to leave this is you know
this is we're too close they're gonna find us we gotta go she was definitely gonna get us caught
i mean that's where i was thinking she was having a meltdown i mean she really was melting down
she was she was coming apart one morning in march of 2005 rebecca takes a shower not true
24 hours i was there we had an argument to steal away
he takes all the cash but leaves behind all his cell phones that's true anyway that i could
got a hold of him he left and i was just like what and so um i expected okay he's gonna come back
he's just mad he's gonna come back and well he never came back she says you took all the money
she like keep in mind look that that is basically see how it's that she that that slob
yeah whatever's going on there that's basically how she well they did a good job um so that was
actually a good b-roll so out to the b-roll team at nbc so um first of all she didn't get a job
for a year so if you didn't get a job for a year how did you live if i took all the money
you had 500 grand bitch yeah you had 500 grand so one you did keep the money you're also she
had bought a brand new car and a motorcycle um she's paid in full for beauty school so she's
going to beauty school because she realizes after a few months he ain't coming back so she says okay
she gets beaut does the beauty school thing so how did you do all of that with no money
i mean it doesn't even make say but see like american they don't even question that no of
course not and i and the secret service agent uh adrian peacock she told me she's like no i mean
we we know you left her with money because i was like i left her with money and i don't have any
fucking money you mean money uh yeah fucking she had money and they're like no we know she had
money they're like look she had like 30 grand in the bank the cars paid for motorcycles paid for
she's got jewelry she's been paying fucking like $2,000 of $2,200 or something like that
every month this is fucking 15 years ago so she they're like trust me we know she's got money yeah
but anyway so yeah total fucking bullshit weeks turn into months and rebecca tries to go straight
she makes up a new name rebecca sue hicky and goes to work as a cocktail waitress
but someone recognizes her face we got a phone call based on our wanted poster
that this person believed that she was using the name rebecca hicky rebecca hawk is arrested in
houston while attending class at a cosmetology school there were about five us marshals that
came in to class and i was just like oh man and i you know i thought they're here for me the secret
service hopes rebecca can answer their most depressing question where is matt cox she hasn't
seen him or talked to him in a year cox is still on the run now he's in nashville with a new girl
and a new real estate company single mother maybe it's karma catching up with him but the con man
is about to become a victim when american greed returns you can't get away with that forever
you're gonna get caught is that the actual lady i've actually never i that that place officer
um like i've seen her on the show and i've seen quotes from her and stuff i don't remember talking
to her i think she may have been the person that called me to say hey can you meet us at that house
but i don't ever remember interacting with her in nashville matt cox is living it up
while his old girlfriends get used to prison strikes rebecca hawk has been arrested by the
secret service and allison arnold is in prison gail mckinsey is the federal prosecutor in charge
of the case there was absolutely no regard for the over 100 victims that he left behind
his girlfriends slash accomplices he knew they had gone to jail he just moved on with more and more
fraud in nashville cox forms yet another fraudulent shell company steals the identity of another
homeless person and starts dating yet another pretty young woman a single mom of course
fucking dickhead she and cox go on a whirlwind mother fucker and then greaves paid for of course
with stolen money and made possible by cox's stash of fake ids you and i can't even get on a plane
without somebody looking at us anymore matt cox uh you know at the top of the most wanted list
was able to create an id that passed muster for him to get out of the country and back in
maybe cox has tempted fate once too often maybe it's karma catching up with him
but one night he's back in nashville relaxing at home with his girlfriend
when two armed intruders break through his front door officer casandra del bosco responds
and cox shows her a video taken from his security camera you can actually see one lift his foot
up and kick in the door and one of them told him at gunpoint and then you see him getting all their
property and and you see cox is he's kind of mad he's not really scared he's mad i was terrified
the thieves get away with the you're terrified fuck yeah it's too fucking god too of what oh the
dude talking about when the guys were actually just kicked in my front fucking door with with
fucking guns screaming get on the fucking ground and everything i'm like fuck well i can think about
was what the fuck do you guys want how do i get rid of these motherfuckers i thought they were gonna
fucking you know i actually didn't i think she said that she said you were mad when you were
kind of explaining it to them or showing the footage of what happened you were mad after the point
i think i was mad during the foot i was definitely i probably looked mad yeah but i was scared okay
you know i'm you know i'm what the fuck you know but i just look mad i'm sure but trust me
fucking pure terror
that's not the idea around the same time the secret service gets a tip from a woman in
nashville she's seen the most wanted poster trena thinks cox is living in her neighborhood
no tipster wait trena trena who's trena trena is the chick that amanda and i my girlfriend the
single mother we're seeing i remember the first podcast podcast 40 yeah i remember now trena
in a while yeah it has uh so trena amanda told trena trena calls and turns me in
that's her mother was they always say the baby a babysitter turned him in the babysitter's mother
or trena's mother was the babysitter she's the one that called it's just stupid it was trena
describes cox to a team secret service then gets in position to make the big arrest
and he's no longer there gone once again this time we were within two days of him
i can't tell you what a tremendous letdown that was the day after officer del bosco gets a page
and i look down on my computer and i noticed that the secret service had just sent out an email
please stay out of the area we're looking for a fugitive and i i looked at the address and i thought
uh hold up a second we just had a home invasion there two days ago and i talked to this supposed
fugitive that they're looking for working with the secret service the nashville police create
a ruse they ask cox to meet them for a follow-up report about the home invasion cox is so confident
in his ability to fool everyone but he falls right into the trap the secret service is waiting
is hey matthew how you doing here's you are matthew cox aren't you and i went yeah matthew cox
and i mean i remember my knees went weak just because i hadn't heard my name out loud and so long
after three years on the run mat cox has finally stopped
he's taken a total of 12 million dollars from banks and private lenders and he's left behind
more than 100 victims once in custody he begins to talk freely to the secret service he was very
forthcoming in what he had done but he was trying to sell to us just like he had tried to sell to
others that there really are no victims and that's what he wanted us to believe that the you know
the title insurance companies that's what they're there for you know insurance companies pay policy
so really no one is hurt rigid brown and her husband were con by cox at a time when they were
caring for a sick child she was constantly in and out of the hospital certainly in our case
and a young family going through some stressful times and he was aware of that you know we mentioned
that getting to the closing was difficult for us because we had to find appropriate medical care
never talked to her till the closing i think it was a pretty poor argument to say that
this was a victimless crime never said it was a victimless crime i pretend 2007
matthew bevan cox pleads guilty to bank fraud mortgage fraud and i do they even got the short
guy with the fuck you know that's me is that actually i thought this was b-roll no that's from
the interview with date line fuck that's the interview with date line oh i thought it was b-roll
the fucking identity theft is later sentenced to 26 years in no i gotta watch that again
and identity theft is later sentenced to 26 years in federal prison
this fellow got what he deserved he got a very stiff sentence in federal prison
and because there's no parole in the federal system anymore he's gonna spend a couple of decades
you're fucking wrong about that bro i wouldn't fucking did 26 fucking years for some for some
fucking money i mean look no offense i'm not saying i shouldn't have done some time but 26
fucking years are you fucking crazy that's insane that's an insane amount of fucking time yeah it
depends on who you ask i guess well i mean clearly to people who might otherwise be inclined to
commit this type of crime rebecca hawk is sentenced to six years in prison but she will be eligible
for release in 2009 she got her story has one more mystery five million dollars of his loot
is still missing leaving the feds wondering where's the money where's the money mad six million
where's it buried um yeah it's uh what do you mean there's no money bro there's no money
where's there's no money there's no money it it you know it hurts when you talk to me like
i have feelings possibilities are limitless as to where he could have put the money cox's former
girlfriends believe he may have an offshore account if he does it'll be a long time before
he's sipping margaritas on a beach mat cox's projected release date is 2029 here we are in 2020
where's the fucking money mad listen came in islands came in i mean i've never been to came in
there's a lot of banks over there there are you know that when i was being interviewed by the
secret service they were like they were um they were saying because when we when amanda and i went
to uh uh went to italy i had i had like a cap fall off right and so i needed to go to a dentist
so i left i was like look while you guys go do this if we were in barry and i said while you
guys go shopping i'm going to go to a dentist so i go to a dentist and i have them they like glue
the fucking thing back on right so when i get picked up the secret service is like listen
you know i'm like oh what are you talking about there's no money there she was like you were in
you had multiple passports you were in barry uh and and amanda told us that you left for like
four or five hours you could have easily opened up multiple bank accounts
and put the money away in cashier's checks or whatever and i was like that's first of all
they would be bank accounts that were being opened by americans the us the us would be notified
that you had a bank account in another country so you know i was like and she and then they were
like well you could for all we know you've got uh you've got ids and other people's names outside
of the country so for all we now i'm like listen listen stop if you were smart you would have yeah
if i was smart but i'm not that smart everybody thinks i'm so sharp i'm not you did a good job
convincing me oh good times okay this was good this was great thank you for doing this and thank
you i'm sure i'm speaking for millions of people on youtube too i'm sure they're all extremely
entertained by this episode they've been looking for it for a long time
yeah i don't know what about the dateline one oh we should do that one next yeah but you gotta get
like you know what you don't want to paint you don't listen it's twice as bad as this one is it
really it's fucking it's not one on youtube because they actually interview me oh shit um
let's see is it we'll find it we'll do it we'll do oh no it's not it's not
oh no it's nowhere i've looked and looked everybody's listen i got an army of guys in the
comment section who have scoured the internet they way if they was if you could find it they'd
have found it yeah but to get this i had to get american greed i had to because it was on hulu
initially when i first got out then they took like the whole season down and so i had to contact
is it mbc i have no they i had to contact the producers of whatever so you have it
what no for for american greed i give you have the dateline episode no i'm saying i can't i had
to contact them they wanted me to give them like eleven hundred twelve hundred dollars or something
first then they came back and i was like no no you don't understand i'm the guy i'm there like
to license it to you it's this much plus every time i was like license it bro i said i'm the guy in
the episode so then they come back and they okay well we'll sell you one for four hundred dollars
