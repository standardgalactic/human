Hi everybody just want to say huge thanks to all the new subscribers of the show on the last few
episodes and if you're new to the show or if you've even watched a few episodes and you haven't yet
subscribed please hammer that subscribe button below the video it really helps us a lot and we've
been getting a little bit of a nudge in the algorithm the high priests and priestesses at
YouTube have been showing us some love thanks to you guys so if you're into paleontology the future
of AI or mass extinction events and even UFOs we get into all of that on this podcast this one
was a wild ride so without further ado please enjoy this insanely fascinating conversation
with michael garfield
dude i've never seen anybody come so prepared like you just did
what was that you just scooped into your mouth before we did this white vein
cratum white vein yeah and plus you got the cratum drink you're you got so you're like fully loaded
on cratum i live dangerously how does that make you feel um like i don't need to drink as much
coffee really yeah so i was telling egan when i when i drink a whole one of these things i start to
feel like really up i start to feel like slow and drowsy i have to drink like maybe a three
quarters of that to feel good well good i mean to feel alert at least so you got you got a super
high tolerance for cratum i feel like i my brain hasn't worked the right way since i was 16 and
they used to serve bottomless coffee i think probably still do at the international house
of pancakes and so like at 16 it was the only place we could go to stay up late in kansas city
and i drank like 27 cups of coffee or something and one night that's what happens when your
teenagers are unsupervised yeah you know so like since then my biochemistry is just unusual
really yeah who knows anyway here we are yeah thanks for coming dude absolutely i'm excited to
talk to you today you you have uh you're interested in some some really weird yeah well we live in
weird times right we live in strange like weird in my my friend and mentor eric davis eric with a k
fantastic author and culture critic and he likes to say that we live in the times of global weirding
yeah you know that the like global warming is just like a a subcategory of this larger
phenomenon that includes things like the breakdown of the boundary between the real and the virtual
and you know the the way that like our hyper connected technological infrastructure has
made it so that memes ripple through the population faster than ever so like we're kind of all on the
inside of each other's heads all the time and so like you know weirding in that sort of classic
british aisles like wyrd sense means to twist it's like to the weirding of something is to
is is to twist the outside and the inside together in a way that is like the weaving of
one's fate you know and so when he when he talks about global weirding it's like well that's
the phenomenon that my friends and I are are all kind of principally preoccupied with is like
what is digital technology what are psychedelics what are the you know all of these different
long-term trends doing in in this moment that is dissolving the kind of more conventional
categories of inside and outside of self and other of you know being located in a simple
address in space and time versus a more complex address like we you know like we live in now
where it's like well where are we exactly you know something that happens on the other side
of the planet affects us in a way that it didn't before yeah so yeah i love that stuff your uh
your title is paleontologist slash futurist what does that mean it means i started in paleontology
and uh did that like i did it semi professionally uh for my teenage years i was going out to do
dinosaur digs in wyoming with robert bacher who was one of the principal paleontological
consultants for the book and film Jurassic Park and took me under his wing as a kid and
engaged me in a kind of like socratic learning for years and years and then right when i was
about to get out of school at the University of Kansas and pursue paleontology as a doctoral
student i read a couple of papers on animal communication and the evolution of intelligence
and language that got me interested in these like really really big questions about the history of
our planet and what evolution really means and all of this stuff and these are questions that you
can't really pursue through easily through a study of the the vertebrate paleontological record
you know so like there's it's beautiful to be out in the in the badlands and like you know
digging up stuff that nobody's ever seen and there's a kind of nature mysticism of like you
know kind of a meditation on silence and wildness involved in that work that i i fell in love with
but then i fell in love with these other questions about the evolution of consciousness and uh and
then fell in love with the woman who's now my partner who was still had a couple years of school
left to do so i got kind of stalled out decided i didn't want to go to grad school and that i wanted
to figure out where or i wanted to find a grad school where i could pursue this other stuff
and there just wasn't a place for it because these kinds of questions in the biological sciences
are only addressed through basically like complex systems science which only until only very recently
actually were there any complex systems grad programs anywhere in the united states or anywhere
and so there was nowhere to study it and and everyone was like don't do this
you're uh you know you will become the bane of any organization that tries to take you on
as a grad student because you're not supposed to be asking big cosmic questions you're supposed to be
you know doing these little tiny you know your grad advisor gives you some tiny piece of their
thing yeah it's it's all very siloed and and sort of disciplinary fragmentation everywhere
and so i was like well this is dumb like i'm i'm in love with these questions
so i guess i just have to go pursue them on my own and and then that leads a person into you
know like out of thinking about deep time just merely in the past starting to ask questions about
the co-evolution of humans and technology and what what we're becoming right like what are we
turning into and how is that related to major evolutionary transitions that have happened on
the past before you know on the planet in the past like the origin of cellular life or multi
cellularity or the uh you know the the atmosphere as a kind of artifact that's created through
relationships between plants and animal and fungi and so like yeah all these big questions
go through the lens of paleontology but come out on the other side as kind of practical
inquiries into how do we navigate the transformations that our geosphere biosphere
technosphere are going through right now what does it mean to be a person living through this stuff
yeah you know those kinds of things so yeah do you ever do you ever go on any dinosaur digs
anymore i haven't been on one in 20 years but how many dinosaurs have you dug up oh that's
hard to say because you don't always know that they're coming the bones are from the same animal
oh really right so you don't always get like a perfectly shaped dinosaur you just find
random sporadic bones no that's gross hollywood misrepresentation of the actual you don't just
get to sit there with a toothbrush and like you know just like in jurassic park like they're just
like oh hey look there's a whole thing here it's not like that at all it's like some some sites are
like that and they're very rare in the world like the goby desert mongolian dinosaur quarries are
kind of like that where you know the the whole animal was buried in a sandstorm or whatever and so
you just get this perfect skeleton that's coming out of the the sand but then a lot of places
like the allosaur quarry that we dug up in wyoming was an allosaurus nest that had been
buried in a mud slide and then over years the gas from the rotting corpses what's an allosaur
oh it's like a it's it's like a kind of an ancestral relative it's not it's not a direct
ancestor but it's it's a kind of like a smaller tyrannosaurus it from the they were the ones that
were hunting stegosaurus and bronosaurus and stuff in the late jurassic and so they you know they've
got a they're really beautiful animals about 30 feet long they've got three big claws on each hand
and this site yeah there you go this site showed the the behavior of allosaurs as family creatures
with advanced parental caregiving because you could see the the way that the parents were
bringing chunks of dinosaurs back to the nest and then letting their kids feed on them and
they actually you know bacher and his crew actually found the the hip bone of an allosaurus that had
been had been fully penetrated by the spike on the tail of a stegosaurus and this animal
should have died from its wound but then was clearly nursed back to health because the wound
had gotten septic and you could see an abscess in the bone but then the animal survived and did
not starve to death and healed and like the the inference that you can draw from finding a fossil
like that is that its brothers and sisters or its mate or whatever we're bringing back food for this
animal to eat while it nursed itself to recovery and so you have this like you know 144 million
years ago you have these really advanced family behaviors that you know we've kind of taken for
granted as you know something that only humans do or something that only mammals do and it turns out
that you know dinosaurs loved each other and took care of each other and you know like helped each
other mend broken bones and stuff like this and but yeah but that site was uh that site was totally
scattered nail quarry at komo bluff was totally scattered because as the bones rotted in this
mud the uh the bones would turn and so you would get you know stuff that was completely jumbled
it was just like a total like Jackson Pollock chaos of of bones that you know it was like very
hard to tell you know who died first or what was laying on top of what and yeah it says you know
sometimes you find sites like that where it's just if something's buried in a in a real rapid sudden
flood deposit it's just chaos and there's like rocks have been ripped up and deposited on you know
I mean you know this this you know this stuff is I hear you talk about Younger Dryas impact
stuff on the show and it's like it's a similar kind of you know you're looking at the taffonomy
and the stratigraphy what is the um the paleontologists talk about this like talk about
how the impact affected the earth and like if there were more than one I know is that like the
chixelab impact in the yucatan was the one that took out the dinosaurs removed is that
do people think that there could have been more than one impact and where can you find the most
dinosaur bones oh well okay uh so the sorry that was like five questions yeah so so actually
there's I just saw I can't remember the name of the paper um but somebody just did some work
oh it was Jim Kirkland uh who is a fabulous American paleontologist who was involved in
like the discovery of a bunch of notable species but he he just did a paper on an impact in I think
Africa at the end of the Jurassic so it turns out that maybe these like this the Cretaceous period
which is like this the heyday of dinosaurs this like the longest stable period in recent earth
history yeah Kirkland just did uh just showed this paper on uh yeah apparently another meteor
impact in South Africa that may have ended the moral quen yeah the the age of brontosaurus and
stegosaurus so it may be that that um the whole age of dinosaurs was kind of I mean you know the
the Permian extinction also had um you know it was mostly about volcanic eruptions and
and extinction the end Permian which is right before the Triassic which is the the period that
killed the the regime of terrestrial reptiles and the whole like ocean ecosystem that that
basically cleared the slate and made room for dinosaurs to take over and this the end Permian
extinction is the biggest in the history of what the planet it's like 96 of all life on earth make
that big against eve that the image that's not it that one so where where is that here that's
not on this chart because I mean if you look it's about 252 million years ago that there was a
okay so we're only at this one yeah 150 actually if you there's a netflix documentary
life on our planet that goes into some of the the end Permian stuff in detail that you get just
like nothing like there's there's almost nothing left over um and we bounce back from that and
that's just it's funny because like there are um there's they say five mass extinctions and we're
living through the sixth but that's based on a kind of what you know like I consider kind of an
arbitrary marker and there are actually in the kind of recent fossil record there are like 18
enormous extinctions not like 18 yeah there aren't they're not all mass extinctions as far as like
you know Pluto like some people don't consider Pluto a planet but you know it's like that kind of
you know a boundary but there are a lot more major extinction episodes in the history of the
planet than most people realize and uh and that only goes over the last few hundred million years
and if you go back even further to even more you know before the advent of multicellular
like complex life yeah then there were major dieouts like the great oxygenation event
2.2 billion years ago 2.2 billion yeah so like that's when uh cyanobacteria like blue green algae
figured out how to photosynthesize and then over a couple hundred million years
flooded the atmosphere with oxygen and at the time there were no oxygen friendly microbes on the
whole surface of the planet and so it killed off most of life on the planet back when there was
only bacteria and so then like like uh it's so funny because you know uh I was just hearing you
your conversation with the snake brothers and they were talking about you know like there's this
thing of you know like disaster events and people hiding underground and like it's so like there's
this constant theme in extinction events where uh that's what happened at the end permean that's
what happened at the end cretaceous and that's what happened back at the great oxygenation event
was like there were these these horror story moments where the you know like the planet is just
being uh pummeled by acid rain and like this you know plants aren't growing and uh you get
yeah you can see a ton of spikes on this the wikipedia like you can see the the mass extinctions
stick out but then there's like a whole sort of um there's a whole bunch of other stuff going on
and uh and some of these are are possibly due to 250 what's which one is that uh 250 is the
permean permean yeah that's the that's the big boy right there uh but what do you think that that
was you said that was volcanoes yeah there was like a methane bloom um that that made the atmosphere
toxic and and the whole planet was just on fire it's it was nasty um but yeah so the point is that
like the animals that survive through these kinds of events are burrowing animals and so even back in
the uh the great oxygenation event in the precambrian which isn't on this chart um you've got a
cambrian was 500 million years ago yeah yeah so there's that little uh right at the beginning of
this chart is the origin of complex multicellular life with like eyes and okay you know uh external
carapaces and you know they were hunting like modern predator prey dynamics okay come out around
around this time you know the world stops being just jellyfish and corals but yeah so there's
there's this whole uh repeating motif in the history of life of things getting so bad that
the only way that people or the only way that the life on the planet can survive is by either
adapting to poisonous atmospheric conditions or by burrowing underground and waiting it out and
so like the your own uh gut biome is basically the uh the billionaire bunker dwellers of two
billion years ago that decided they were going to wait it out underground and there's they're
still down there waiting it out uh they're still like the anaerobic bacteria are no longer they no
longer conquer the surface of the planet but they're they're inside all of the little places
that they can still hack it out without being poisoned by oxygen right what is the oldest
thing that you found in your digging um i never dug older than the triassic
oh actually no that's not true because i because for a while i grew up in kansas city
in kansas city is uh or division so it's it's uh it's pre mesozoic it's like i think like
350 400 million years ago somebody's gonna call me on this because it's not my this is not my area
but this is when they're like ancient relatives of starfish uh the crinoids were like stocked
they look like uh sea lilies or something like they they have a like a long kind of
armored stock and then the sea star part of it is like up in the water column filter feeding
and so they're all over the midwest you you go to a road cut in the midwest and you can pull out
these gorgeous crinoid specimens and those were all down by the the Missouri river bluffs by my hose
so that's probably the oldest thing but the oldest thing that i i actively dug in wyoming was uh
triassic uh it's it's uh there the wyoming was part of a triassic seaway at the time and so you have
ancient squid relatives called bellam knights that have these armored cones in the core of their
body like like if you're you've got a parrot and it's eating cuttlefish bone you know it's kind of
like that but it was like cone shaped yeah there you go so these guys are all over certain parts
of wyoming and and the rocky mountain areas and they're really interesting gorgeous like there's
there's these fossil deposits where it's just millions and millions of squid butts as bacher used
to say and yeah you just walk around and they're everywhere it looks like it looks like uh spent
bullet casings all over the ground that's wild man so yeah those are really cool because you just
think about the enormous schools of bellam knights uh and other ancient cephalopods that must have
inhabited these waters and it's bonkers like they're just i mean the amount of biodiversity that
has been the norm for our planet over most of its history is just beyond the conception of
somebody living in the modern world you know like even a hundred years ago in America
these guys were dark with flocks of birds you know on a regular basis and we've you know over the
course of your life and mine we've killed off something like half of the song birds in North
America and uh half the insects right and it's just it's just insane to think of like even the
amount of biodiversity our parents grew up with is beyond our imagination and it's crazy to think
that most likely the all these extinction events were cosmic events you know coming from somewhere
else they weren't self-induced like the like right now we are probably the maybe the first
civilization maybe not that actually has the capability and the wherewithal to nuke ourselves
off the face of the earth yeah although you know like the again like the oxygenation event of 2.2
billion years ago was kind of an interesting uh counter example of that was like it's it looks
more like industrial pollution now you know where it's like this is this was a successful
by this was a product of successful manufacturing innovation right like turning air into sugar
and then excreting oxygen as a as an industrial waste in that project and so like when we think
about global warming now and the the excretion of carbon dioxide through modern fuel burning and
manufacturing processes it's really just sort of the opposite side of this larger cycle cycle of
manufacturing innovation and like so you know I used to host a show called complexity podcast where
I talked with Olivia Judson who is a fantastic British author who's done a lot of work on
the history of life as a story of successive waves of innovations to to discover new energy
sources and and kind of exploit them and says that like yeah what we're going through right
now is the discovery of fire but you know back in you know the Cambrian it was the discovery of
flesh it was like you know the modern predator prey dynamics come out of realizing that you
don't have to sort of filter for your food in the water column or generate it yourself and then
even before the other yeah just each other it's so easy it's right there and then and then you
know even before that photosynthesis was this massive thing because up up to that point all life
on the planet was chemosynthetic it was it was getting energy by you know breaking bonds and
molecules you know like like life still does down around the sea vents and so now it's a it's a whole
you know now we've come on to a different thing and you know I interviewed Mingjin Liu for that
same show complexity episode 80 and he studies the evolution of modern plant fungi relationship
and said that like I think up to about 400 million years ago trees like early trees existed
and so would existed but the mycorrhizal cohorts that live in underground in the forest and eat
dead trees they did not exist and so the a lot of the modern fossil fuel deposits are from an
era of the planet where logs were being formed and falling and nothing was eating them and the
whole surface of the planet was covered in falling logs so like if you think about you know what we're
going through right now and all of the industrial byproducts that we're creating and like the gyre
of plastic in the south pacific and all this stuff but like life has already started to evolve
plastic eating microbes that like we're already watching the biosphere adjust to this in the
way that it has adjusted to similar endogenously created environmental disasters in the past
so it's not it's not all cosmic it's like it takes there's like a there's a latency between
us coming up with these these major manufacturing and energy capture innovations and then us
figuring out how to close the material loops that are you know we like new kinds of trash
are invented and then life comes in and figures out how to eat the trash right you know and that
happens over and over and over again and the difference with this one is you know can evolution
adapt rapidly enough to to making use of all of the new forms of trash that we're creating
because like the number of new chemical compounds that we're creating over the last century
like exponentially greater than anything ever before so in that way it is different um but it's
it's not totally unlike you know coming up with photosynthesis and we look at the modern atmosphere
now and we're like oh it's always been this way but it hasn't it's uh right right you know what
we're looking at is is a kind of uneasy piece that life figured out as a response to this
you know potentially devastating uh innovation yeah it's interesting too seeing i'm sure you've
seen rant the graph that randal always shows of the the atmosphere the temperature in the atmosphere
over like the last tens of thousands of years and the crazy variations and how it was like
i think it was during like the 1400s uh it was like 10 degrees warmer than it is now and that's
when all the major cathedrals were built that's when like the most like incredible art has been
created in our modern history i i generally love the study of of natural history because it helps
keep us kind of humble you know it helps us remember that all of the characteristics of
contemporary life that we take for granted as static are mutable you know that things have
not always been this way and the things will not always be this way i i interviewed henry g
for future fossils podcast i think episode 184 and henry is the senior editor at at nature
magazine or nature journal right um in the uk he wrote a great book on the history of life
and spends a little bit of time at the end of that book speculating this episode of the podcast is
brought to you by bubs bubs naturals is a badass company that has collagen peptides it has coffee
creamer has coffee electrolytes and they are amazing because they are a tribute company to a
navy seal and former cia contractor glenn bubs dority who died defending american freedom
in vengasi libya again there is obviously no shortage of collagen products available on the
internet but i support bubs because it is not only a superior product but they support american
veterans by donating 10 of all their proceeds to veteran organizations and 100 of their proceeds
on veterans day bubs collagen peptide packets are easy to use as a daily supplement i keep them in
my truck and i drink them on the way to the gym it's flavorless easy to mix nature it makes it
easy to mix into anything i prefer mixing it in coffee you may not know but after the age of 25
your natural production of collagen starts to fade which can severely impact your skin and an
interesting thing about collagen is the more you supplement with it the more your natural
production increases since i started using it a few months ago i've already noticed a huge improvement
in my joint connective tissues my skin elasticity and the overall quality of my hair believe it or
not you can support bubs and this podcast by visiting bubs naturals dot com and using the

promo code djp at checkout for 20 off it's linked below now back to the show about the distant future
like after human civilization has crumbled and you know hundreds of millions of years into the
future um olaf stapled in another british author from the 1930s wrote a couple of really great
books that are kind of canonical major inspiring works in 20th century science fiction called
last and first minute star maker and both of them do this like they look billions of years into the
future you know and and that's like i love that stuff i love i love thinking about uh you know
what what comes you know if if there was a time when plants and fungi were not locked together
in symbiosis and now we're seeing this this kind of thing where like humans and machines
are becoming kind of more and more symbiotic and then like then what you know what's right you know
what's 100 million years from now look like what are these kind of people's what are those people
speculate ah god i mean you that's just where you get to have fun yeah like you you uh i mean
i mean this is the sort of uh epistemic challenge to think epistemic yeah like you'll find that yeah
so like so like you know uh ontology is the study of like you know what things are methodology is
the study of how you know like how you kind of uh know things and then uh epistemology is is related
to that but it's it's about like belief and knowledge yeah how do you how do you come to
things you know who who is who's asking how are they asking and so you know um the uh you know when
you hear people i hear people online talk a lot about how we're in the midst of an epistemic crisis
right now in human society because our our information technology there's too much information
right yeah so we don't know we don't know how to make sense of them we don't know how to validate
information anymore right like um i'll send you here let me let me pull up a i love citing this
paper uh or this this essay by my friend jamie stantonian here um apocalyptic cults in the early
modern information explosion apocalyptic cults yeah so he's talking about the the printing press
and the 30 years war and how uh the the decline you have it pulled up on you yeah yeah it's right
here you can switch to him steve yeah that that uh the loss of authority the legitimacy crisis that
the printing press posed to the church was uh you know created a power vacuum into which flowed
all of these different apocalyptic cults that were spreading their own versions of the bible through
self-printed pamphlets and so like you know the um the the the moment where munich uh ends up
becoming a walled city full of like uh end times apocalyptic fanatics and then goes into you know
battle with the the catholic church you know and bishops like send soldiers to reclaim munich
we're going through something like that right now where uh the amount of the time that it's taking
to to generate new information like i don't know if you've noticed but like most scientific papers
now like people are just publishing stuff to archive and then it's there you know archive.org
being this this sort of pre-print server run by cornell university where like all of the machine
learning papers right now are going straight to archive before they make it through peer review
and so people have access to all of this newly produced knowledge but it's being generated
faster than the process whereby academic journals were created you know the process that like academic
academic journals evolved in order to um sort of vet things who's producing all these papers
i mean a lot of them are university research but there's private research and and then there's
just people working in the garage and and you know so like with covid here i'll i'll pull up a
and and why are they publishing them direct to archive.com well archive.org you know arx ivy this
is where uh you know it's it's the the process of science has changed somewhat over the course of
our lives to uh so that there's there's like this additional not everybody does this but
a lot of people believe in in open science as a way of saying like we're going to publish our work
as a as a public good as a service to public to public conversation and then you know it's
going to go through the process of peer review still but like more work is being done than can
possibly be peer reviewed and so like you get into these things um i wrote this paper about
this in in 2020 about how do you you know how do you make sense of this stuff now like so like
this was about covid and how uh the problem that scientific institutions got into with the public
during covid was that you know people have been kind of trained to believe that science is the sort
of you know fixed point like that that's there's an orthodoxy yes and there i mean it's it's not
just a free for all it's not science is a broad term yeah right like science like right there
trust the science street we we're the scientists we are you know the the people in the ivory tower
who have studied this our whole lives and have the credentials to tell you what to do there's a
there's a sort of uh mightier than thou sort of vibe well i mean the it really is like all
science you know all knowledge you know you can kind of trace it around a circle of you know an
observation that starts from personal experience and then is you know you ask a friend to you know
hey like stand here and look at this and tell me what you see you know that they see the same thing
than that intersubjective validation you know i thou validation yeah is more robust than just i
saw a ufo or whatever and then uh but but then like maybe the two of you grew up in the same house
and so you're biased in the same way you know and so then you know science as most people
understand it is this third person validation where you bring in somebody from a completely
different set of experiences and they're gonna you know you try to find you stress test these
claims as hard as you can but there is no fundamental there's no moment where you
have you know like the the replication crisis going right going on right now in psychology
and in pharmacological medicine has a lot to do with um the fact that the the mechanical
like you know the action of different uh you know psychoactive or uh you know different medical
things have so much to do with expectation and the placebo effect and so on that uh
you can run the experiments 20 years later and get different results because the the
culture has changed right and so people's expectations have changed and like the way that
there's a there's a famous set of psychological experiments done by daryl bem who called feeling
the future let's see uh so daryl reversed the time series on all of these famous psychology
experiments i think nine famous psychology experiments and this this piece is him basically
saying uh we took for granted that the past comes before the future but if you reverse the order of
these experiments you can see that people are like you get results that are as statistically
significant um if you have them you know select something before they actually see the slide
or whatever so he was saying like look according to your own standards uh the field of psychology
needs to admit that we are we have some sort of precognitive ability and people went insane
over this paper and it was the result of an ongoing debate in psychology in clinical psychology
or in experimental psychology about whether the discipline itself is flawed or whether
we like you know like a lot of people claimed that he was burying negative results
and a lot of people reproduced his work but then denied that they had and it's just a it's a complete
mess in there and so like when you know this this issue of um it's not that science is broken
it's that science itself continues to evolve and we get more and more nuanced about the way that we
structure our experiments and the way that we validate the way we understand the statistical
support for a given phenomenon and then also you know moxplunk is famous for saying that
science precedes one death at a time or one funeral at a time because people get so stuck in
their thinking that they deny the validity of anomalous evidence and they need to be replaced
by younger researchers with fresh eyes and it's so corruptible as well i mean everything is i mean
like i don't want a single science out here as because there is a problem generally i interviewed
teen wen a university of utah philosopher several years ago and uh let's see where is this
oh that's on the sub stack um yeah teen wen and i had a really interesting conversation about
expert identification and how uh basically like if you're not an expert in a field then you can't
actually validate what an expert is saying and the amount of time it takes to develop expertise
is always longer than the amount of time that you have to communicate something you know like a
complex idea right um and so it's not just climate scientists versus everyone else it's also uh you
know uh geopolitical experts versus everyone else it's also plumbers versus everyone else it's like
there are there are you know kind of a an unspecified you know kind of theoretically infinite number
of things that you can be an expert in and uh and as knowledge becomes more and more developed as
our body of knowledge becomes more developed then the amount of time it takes to learn some of these
fields uh means that like there are more kinds of expertise it takes longer to acquire that expertise
and so we're we're on the surface of this like growing volume of information
that's that is you know with these major information technology revolutions like
printing press or the internet we have to we we hit these periodic uh crises in being able to
understand how to uh how to articulate the knowledge and like bring it together and like
unify it um and so Simon Dadeo um uh a Carnegie Mellon Mellon professor I interviewed years ago
for complexity talks about this let me see if I can find this oh this is a fantastic talk he gave
years ago oh wait not this one um super theories dadeo conciliants he he uh he gave a talk yeah
here we go super theories and conciliants from alchemy to electromagnetism looking over the
history of the proceedings of the royal society the the oldest scientific journal and running
uh statistical analysis on this body of of data that showed that every let me see every 150 years
or so uh we go through this wave where knowledge let me see I think this is it yeah so you can
see these these spikes in the confidence of this is a mutual information in bits is the linkage
between different disciplines in science and uh so we go through these things we're about 100 years
we get more and more unified in our scientific understanding so like you can see
where the study of electricity and the study of magnetism ends up becoming the study of
electromagnetics you know it's like it becomes one discipline and then um and then there's a
50 year gap where suddenly uh that that innovation in scientific thinking generates so much new
insight that we lose the plot and so we're in one of these right now where the successes of
the scientific endeavor have given us so much more to consider now that we don't know how to
fit it all together and we're going to go through another couple of decades before it starts making
sense again um but it's not it's not a crisis in terms of like what science is and it's not a
crisis that's unique to the academy or to any other specific institution that deals with you
know like it's not a crisis unique to journalism um this is something that happens with every new
institution and within 150 years whatever institutions we come up with now to unify the
knowledge produced by the internet will be in crisis again and we'll have to come up with
some new system but science will persist science will continue to evolve and and become more and
more uh effective and capable of making sense of things it just won't be science like most people
think of it now yeah it seems like there's gotta be like it like there's gotta be something else
like another way to to like everything can't just be weighed and measured in a lab right like
there this is one of the things I was talking to uh Annie Jacobson about a couple weeks ago
when she wrote this book called The Phenomena and she was explaining that some of these
precognitive ESP um abilities that people have they they can't be duplicated and they can't
be weighed and they can't be measured and there's this huge divide and there's this there's this
clash that goes on between um the the phenomena and the scientific method right because they
they just don't mix and and you can't duplicate any of this stuff but it's a it's very much a
real thing and this is something I was also talking to Jack Sarfati about a little bit um
he's like these people who was I asking him I think I was asking I was asking about some
somebody who was coming in uh who was like skeptical about the whole UFO phenomenon like
and Jack you know obviously he's got his opinions that is like I was like I'll find them these people
are f***ing idiots Danny they're f***ing idiots I know this because I've seen it it exists okay
just because you can't f***ing weigh it and put it in a beaker doesn't mean it's not real
totally well I mean so so my graduate advisor I ended up going to grad school for a little bit
and then dropping out because it's uh you know life but the um my graduate advisor Sean Espion Hargens
worked with the American integral philosopher Ken Wilbur on this uh what he called integral
methodological pluralism which is an attempt to take postmodern philosophy where we recognize that
that uh even our empirical investigations of the world are constrained by our language
and that uh there is no way for us to know something with total absolute objectivity
you know because like we all kind of live in a virtual reality yes you know this this kind of
like our brain is generating this thing based on experience everything you know I talk about this
all the time with people that I have in here who like to talk about everything and it's like you
you haven't been to this part of the world and seen what's happened here you f***ing read news
articles and watch youtube so do I I do the same f***ing thing like there's like what one of the
things that really f***ing frustrates me about some people is that people like to talk about things
as if they are like absolute f***ing fact and they know it and these people their job is to
know stuff obviously but all they do is they read stuff that other people write that those people
got from somebody else or something else that they read or that they saw yeah I mean so yeah so
that's the thing is that like as um you know even the most rational person has to base some
of their behavior in the world on expert claims made by other people that they can't directly
validate yes you know and that this doesn't mean that it's a it's an ontological free for all like
it doesn't mean that like there isn't you know that we can't approach truth and that there aren't
some people that see certain truths more clearly than other people and so like it's important to
be clear about that but what it does mean is that we need to be more humble about what we
you know like the things that we are taking for granted on the you know on the basis of belief
because we don't have the time or the unlimited energy to sit there and scrutinize everything
everyone ever tells us and so you know Hargens and Wilbur wrote this really cool piece for the
the Oxford Handbook of Religion and Science several years ago unifying this so like I don't
know is this up on the yeah screen yeah so like here is punch on it a little bit yeah let me let me
see a good example so this is a piece that Sean a chart that Sean worked on with Ken where like you
can see um empirical science fits into one corner of this chart where they're looking at the exteriors
the the descriptions and behaviors of phenomena through the lens of singular entities you know
so this is like animal behaviorism or cognitive science but then you know there are there are
other ways there are other schools of knowledge like phenomenology which is concerned with the
interiority the felt sense the qualitative uh uh claims that can be made about your own internal
personal experience and then you have you know uh different sort of ethnic studies and and the
study of meaning and language are the the the cultural sort of interior plural dimensions
of experience you know it's like what you and I agree a cat means the word cat you know and so
and so on and so like you can take this framework and you can start to say that for instance zen
meditation as a technique does obey the scientific method in that they give you a
a behavior they give you an injunction they give you a like sit on a mat for 20 years observing
your breath and then you will have an experience that an expert in the field can tell you
you've had this experience or they can tell that you're lying and that is peer review and that is
you know like when people like Terrence McKenna and Tim Leary compared taking psychedelics to
looking through the microscope what they were saying was there is an experimental protocol
and if you follow this protocol you end up with these results and these results can be verified
but it's not quantitative in the way that a lot of people uh mistakenly kind of conflated with
science where they're saying you know like only science generally like science is only the concern
about quantitative data we don't have a way to measure a dream right well i mean we're getting
there like there is uh you know for years i've been saying that i expect that one day i'm gonna
have a you know a kid and then the kid's gonna be uh you know streaming their dreams on tick
you know tick tock or whatever you know uh with a brain computer interface and you'll be
you'll be a dream influencer because you'll be able to like just like let other people subscribe
to your feed and then just a couple months ago this group found a way to use machine learning
to translate the visual cortex activity into images and so you're able to see what somebody
else is dreaming yeah this this is a recent thing but like i i do what i can to stay on top of of
ai research and this is a big deal that like who did this uh good question uh let's see like
how do they produce the images like is it video still images machine learning yeah no they can
limit you can pull uh let's see here uh deep dreaming is a problem brain scan well deep dream
is something else hold on oh yeah ai recreates what people see by reading their brain scans
what this is this is not the most recent research holy but this is preliminary research to the stuff
that i'm i'm talking about here um and so this year this is a year ago it's way better now
and uh so it's not going to be long before uh we can actually get into people's heads and do some
really really interesting work on you know like for instance you know one of the things i've always
been really curious about and i'm i'm excited to see develop over the next year or so is um
having doing this for people that are on psychedelics you know and so like you know i
have my friends uh sarah huntley and david j brown have a book in in edit right now with
inner traditions on a field guide to dmt entities and they uh you know sarah created illustrations
of all of these different major types of of things that people kind of frequently see when
they're tripping right and you know and so we're going to be able to get kind of to the point where
you know one of my favorite pieces let me see if i can pull this up one of my favorite essays of
all time is alice huxley's introduction introduction to heaven and hell um let's see painting while
dancing that uh yeah so let me just read you this quote because this is sort of the the
marching orders of my whole life he says like the earth of 100 years ago our mind still has its
darkest africans its unmapped borneos and amazonian basins in relation to the fauna of these regions
we are not yet zoologists we are mere naturalists and collectors of specimens the fact is unfortunate
but we have to accept it we have to make the best of it however lowly the work of the collector
must be done before we can proceed to the higher scientific tasks of classification analysis
experiment in theory making like the giraffe and the duck bull platypus the creatures inhabiting
these remote regions of the mine are exceedingly improbable nevertheless they exist they are facts
of observation and as such they cannot be ignored by anyone who is honestly trying to understand
the world in which he lives and it goes on but this this you know this this my entire life
you know after the four years i spent as a scientific illustrator at the university of
kansas natural history museum i've been thinking about you know the art that i make uh as you
know in in light of this kind of work in light of like going in um my buddy android jones talks
about this too about you know visionary art which is the you know the american kind of
tradition that came out of fantastic realism in europe which came out of surrealism and so
there's a direct lineage between like dolly and uh Ernst fuchs and and uh you know hr gieger
who were looking at dreams and visionary states and then just painting what they saw and then by
the time that comes over to the states through like robert venosa and alex gray and kind of the
the modern uh you know four fathers and four mothers of visionary art i like the dinosaur
like saucer yeah thanks yeah that's uh dude let me get some art i need some oh i will i was i'll
send you some prints yeah but the um you know so there's like there's a whole tradition the
tradition of artists that i grew up with are people that think about uh you know going in with
you know a a dedication to having you know unusual or quote unquote non-ordinary experiences
and then treating it like a natural history illustrator and you know trying to record this
stuff and so like my friends and i all paint this stuff but then like it won't be long before
you know just as you know a generative ai has allowed non painters to paint right it won't be
that long before it allows people to have just really incredible vivid dreams and trips and other
things to to present fairly accurate representations of their own inner world that other people can
compare to their own weird experiences and say oh there's something here you know we should we
should dig on the x you know yeah see what we can see what we can see what stable features we can
uh encode in scientific theory so yeah there was an article that i don't know if it was a
podcast i was listening to or if this was one of your essays that you wrote about how like the
role reversal between uh creativity and ai how we're like switching the roles and like ai is
sort of like turning us into blobs and this one yes i think it was this one that i read this morning
and you know that's it's something that one of the things that i've noticed recently is that
like when it comes to the medium that which i published this podcast is which is mostly youtube
we get most of our audience on youtube i noticed a lot of people on youtube and i know there's
ad agencies doing this as well but we've gotten so far off track that like we're using people are using
chat gpt and ai to literally tell them what kind of videos to make
giving them all the footage and all the frames for their videos giving them the music giving them
the thumbnails giving them the titles and i know ad agencies are even using the stuff to like tell
them where to put logos on commercials how long commercials should be how they should be narrated
and all this stuff and it's like ai is sucking all the creativity out of out of the human not
really out of the human mind just it's like we don't need to do it anymore so it's like let's
just let ai do it it is weird uh so yeah this this piece that you're talking about improvising out
of algorithmic isolation was commissioned by a friend who wanted me to write about improv
versus surveillance capitalism right you know and like that's what we're talking about we're
talking about the attention economy and using stuff like gaze tracking software to you know
to tell how long somebody is looking at you know at whatever uh and then they also had the
zoom on instagram if you know if you zoom in on something they'll like start giving you more
that person's shit yeah exactly so so like all of this is you know the stuff that grew out of
creating a an ad revenue model yeah for the web is uh you know it's so like i want to link that
that piece to two other pieces let me see there's this piece i wrote a couple years ago called
the evolution of surveillance talking about this in this way talking about you know augmented
reality and and spatial computing and what do you mean when you say surveillance are you talking
specifically about like like uh the the the way ad agencies target people to target ads to them
and stuff well it's it's uh it's about behavior
like behaviorism generally right like the more cameras we have the more keystroke
logging we we use the more gaze tracking we use it's about trying to model behavior and then in
order to either intervene and and you know shape the way that people are behaving or in order to
predict them such that you can sell them things more efficiently etc and this is you know the
point that i was making in this essay is that this is not actually new that like all of these new
uh sensory and uh like behavior modeling innovations that we're making with digital
technology are an extension of this longer arms race between predators and prey that goes back
at least to the evolution of the eye where it's like suddenly you have this whole new dimension
where you're not just sensing a prey animal or you know an organism uh along a kind of chemical
gradient and you know you can actually see something at a distance and watch it turn
to avoid you and then you can chase it and that's something like that is going on right now where
you know cambridge analytic knows your facebook browsing behavior so well that it's able to
predict you more effectively than your own spouse you know and like this kind of stuff and so what
what's happening is that um you know in this piece on improvisation this the evolution of these um
these surveillance infrastructure you know the algorithms and the you know the camera networks
and all the stuff yeah uh is modifying people's behavior in two different ways one is it's making
people uh you know like living inside of these systems you know you've got six different emoji
reacts on facebook you don't have like a whole multi-dimensional spectrum of human emotional
response you know you're limited to six sort of stock responses or you can leave a comment you
know but like so like the more embedded we are in these in the machinery of civilization the more
it constrains our behavior repertoire in certain ways even as it creates more options for us in
other ways and then the other thing is that uh all of these systems like evolution is itself a form
of improvisation and evolution is this in the way that i've come to understand it through you know
these like really like a fundamental study of evolution as a process includes more than just
genetic evolution it includes you know the the way that your brain wires neurons together as an as a
as a way of encoding stable features in your own environment so that your behavioral response at
the level of an individual has evolved to meet you know the the environment at that timescale and
not just at the timescale of genetic inheritance and so on and so like the um the thing with you
know these these systems is that yeah they are uh they're you know it's it's not simple i mean it's
not adequate to say that they're making us dumber but it's not it's neither is it adequate to say
that they're making us smarter like you know we are collectively smarter um but in certain ways
individually dumber but then are also capable of hyper-specializing and knowing things about the world
to a far deeper extent than was you know possible you know there was no such thing as cognitive
neuroscience 200 years ago you know and so like at any rate like the the machines become more and
more lifelike as they evolve to model the behavior of living organisms namely people
and then we become in certain ways more mechanical but uh the place where those two trends meet on
the horizon is that you know uh you've got Yuval Harari's uh he gave a google tech talk
on the religions of silicon valley uh a few years ago the new religions of the 21st century talks
at google february 2015 where he talked about how uh the the revolution in computing has made it so
that we no longer have uh we no longer have a a notion that humans are these sort of isolated
self-determining self-authoring rational actors you know which is like the the idea that dominated
economics for like most of the last hundred years and now what we have is that the human is sort of
a bundle of different um unconscious algorithms that are all like modular and connected and nested
inside of each other and that the human being is nested inside of a larger social order that is
itself kind of an organism in its own right but that it's it's sort of like a turtles all the way
down of unconscious uh algorithmic reactivity to each other so like you know like we you know the
sort of blade runner conclusion that you come to is that humans are robots and robots are people
um and you know there's that's a contentious philosophical claim but like but like you know
the buddha said as much right like a lot of the you know the eastern non-dual traditions are about
how everything that we take for granted as the behavior of an organism that it's choosing what
it does if you inquire deeply enough into the nature of the mind you realize that all of your
choices are are sort of mechanical responses to your conditioning you know that that's like you
know karma is like a you know a a an impossibly complex network of mutual causation this episode
of the podcast is brought to you by pxg when pxg says nobody makes golf clubs the way they do
they're not lying my personal experience with buying golf clubs and using different brands
of golf clubs is i always thought the more expensive golf clubs were the better the quality
but my new set of pxg's has blown that perception out of the water and when i heard about their new
black ops driver the driver that promises you don't have to sacrifice distance for forgiveness
i absolutely had to try it last weekend pxg invited me out to one of the high-end golf courses out
in tampa so i could get a custom fitting with their new black ops driver and it was incredible
one of their golf pros spent an hour with me helping me dial in all the little measurements
and all the little tweaks in the golf club to make sure that i had the perfect fit for my driver
this pxg black ops driver is a breakthrough in driver technology it's a complete and total
victory in golf club engineering something like you've never seen before black ops drivers are
adjustable to deliver a combined moi of 10 000 plus for unreal forgiveness that's ridiculously high
and the higher the moi the more forgiving the club will play meaning you don't have to square the
ball perfectly for it to go straight and to get distance add pxg's new advanced material face
technology and you get incredible ball speed that pushes distance to the absolute limits
that's more forgiveness more distance and no sacrifices the term game changer has been thrown
around so much that it's lost its meaning but trust me when i tell you the pxg driver is a true
game changer learn more and get free shipping on all pxg equipment by going to pxg.com slash

for free shipping on all equipment it's linked below now back to the show you know and so like
that's that's kind of where you know the uh the tech world and you know revolutions in in neuroscience
and so on have taken us is like you're no longer uh you know to the extent that you're no longer an
individual person now right you're you're a city made of cells some of those cells are human some
of them are not and and uh there's a sense in which you at the cellular level um all of your
cells are individuals they're just joined in this thing and you are joined in this bigger thing
you know that we call society which is a kind of super organism and so like where we draw the lines
around individuality uh depend on how far away we're standing from a given phenomenon um and so
you know this this notion that's you know going back to this this stuff that wilbur and and
esparon hargan's worked on like that's uh yeah so like there's a sense in which everything is
individual and there's a sense in which it's uh plural or collective and so similarly there's a
sense in which free will there's a there's a stance you can look at where free will exists
and if you move then it looks like everything is just sort of blindly deterministically causing
everything else and you know the question of like uh free will is a question about the the
philosophical stance that we want to take on emergence like is emergent behavior something
that actually exists or does it just appear to exist because some you know like we see order
in a new way if we stand and look at it at the at the behavior of the cosmos from a different
perspective you know so i i take all of this stuff as uh as like uh you know a lot of this
stuff we can't know for sure because there are limits to our knowledge and the knowability of
things and so it's like well we're probably better off assuming that it's both and that efforts to
try and like pin down reality in one way or another you know saying like oh this is you
know something is purely objective or purely subjective or choice does it does or does not
exist that these are these are methodological artifacts you know like are you a noun or are you
a verb you know which one which one why does one have to be more true than the other anyway
that's a rant do you often take dmt no um not in i mean you know everybody's got their college
years but how many times have you done it oh god that's a good question not in a while
is that did did you get into psychedelics after you were into all the paleontology stuff and
did psychedelics sort of like catapult you into all this definitely part of it yeah i mean i think uh
the
you know the the question of the evolution of intelligence and consciousness is hot on the
heels of realizing that you uh you that everything you thought you knew is up for grabs right you
know and you're like okay well what is the mind and where does it come from and you know how does
language work yeah and those are very those are very undergraduate uh like you know you'd yeah so
but uh you know the the older one gets the cooler ones ones brain runs and uh a little one gets the
cooler ones brain runs well i just mean like your earlier earlier in life your brain is is a
noisier object yes you know children are very like uh distracted and playful and creative and then
as you get older uh University of California Berkeley child psychologist allison gopnik
calls this the explore exploit tension where it's like as you get older in life uh or as a system
ages even um those systems become more conservative and more risk averse and and then uh at some point
you can kind of go back um let's see where i put this there's i wrote a piece on this a while ago
the future is noisy talking about like there's a curve in life uh where as as your senses start
to fail you in in old age you become more childlike again you become more more of a dreamer and you
know more playful but uh but yeah there's so like the relationship diapers again yeah i like this
yeah exactly the the relationship between um like you know the notion that comes out of DMT
research that uh that the basically waking state is a kind of dream constrained by the the the the
wiring of the brain to its senses and so like the the more signal you get from the outside world
uh the more your signal to noise ratio goes up and then as your as your senses develop
or as they fail that that ratio changes and so like different uh you know there are processes
like if you think about that kind of that arc there there are moments in the process of this
science the production of scientific knowledge that are high noise and then there are moments
that are high signal you know like when you're collecting data you want your noise to be as
low as possible but when you're trying to come up with the new hypothesis you want to turn the
noise up and so again this has to do with like the um the way that uh you know for instance uh
you know the people that are like authors talk about you don't want to criticize your first
draft while you're writing it you want to save editing which is a high signal to noise ratio
process uh for later and then you want the original draft of your manuscript to be generated in a
kind of sprint of noise production right right you know um so there's a really great uh paper
there's an exchange of letters uh on uh the role of noise in in innovation in complex systems let's
yeah the role of noise in collective intelligence where a famous psychologist Daniel Kahneman
basically says you know noise is the enemy we're trying to get rid of noise um and then
you know his his critics led by uh David Krakauer and David Wolpert say yeah actually if you
eradicate noise from a system you lose all creativity in the system it you lose the
ability for that system to adapt to uh surprise in its environment so I don't know if that
answers your question but there are definitely times in life where it's appropriate perhaps
or it's more appropriate you know if you uh to pursue trance and psychotic adventure and
lateral thinking and creative weirdness yeah I think like the farther down the road we get
and the advancement of technology and you know if we ever hit the point of I'm sure we will
but the point of like a singularity we would maybe maybe humanity will just want to escape
this reality that we are in right now like it's like the matrix right it's like we're unplugged
right now and maybe uh like a certain a certain group of human population will just go like dive
into psychedelics and just try to like DMTX themselves into that world for the rest of
their lives and some people will fucking join the machines yeah so you know uh our buddies uh
Egan and Patrick and Noah Nottix you know I'm on the advisory board of this organization that
wants to start doing uh extended state DMT work and other kinds of fundamental psych
psychedelic research I'm really excited about this because I've I've always been uh more interested
in asking fundamental scientific questions than in therapeutic research you know like I mean
obviously we're in the middle of a mental health crisis it's very important that people have access
to the best possible tools to maintain their mental health uh I know a lot of people who have
benefited from a therapeutic encounter with psychedelics but uh when it comes to you know
asking questions about the nature of reality and the greatest mysteries that science can ask
then it seems obvious that we've left a huge uh bid on the table over the last several decades to
use psychedelics as scientific instruments and to like ask questions that we can only ask
in different states of consciousness and to you know to use these things uh in a different way
I've been pursuing that that line of questioning on the the show for a while um
you need to talk to the people at the CIA they've been doing it for a long time
yeah yeah so like that's you know that's uh that that's an interesting case right where
the CIA is not constrained by the same sort of uh socioeconomic concerns that academic research
is right concerns right right exactly you've got like Bustamante like on your show advocating for
enhanced interrogation because it's it's practical you know it's it's it's how you get results and
and so like that's the thing is like military research uh has a lower barrier to being like
it has more willingness to pursue uh something that might work blue sky research yes try try
whether it benefits us or not right whether we understand the mechanism for it maybe it's
useless knowledge right actually and that's an interesting fact about the cold war is that
russia took a very different approach to uh physics and psychology research behind the iron
iron curtain and was not as bound as american academic research to try and understand how
to try and pose a mechanism for stuff like telekinesis uh before they would actually go
ahead and look at it and so like one of the most interesting stories from american science over the
last you know 50 years is the story of the princeton engineering anomalies research lab
i talk about it in episode 186 of future fossils a manifesto for weird science they
by the way i love the name of your podcast oh thanks future fossils is such a sick name
thanks yeah it's that uh it's that paleontologist futurist it's that whole thing yeah take the
whole span in at once but uh the parallel princeton engineering anomalies research
was funded by i think it was a lockheed it was either lockheed or mcdonald i'm gonna catch
myself on this um but they oh yeah here we go the full show notes are actually on patreon
but yeah they they um they got a a a grant from uh aerospace because they want you know
aerospace wanted to know whether the brain as an electromagnetic phenomenon was influencing
the sensitive electronics inside a fighter pilot cockpit and so the dean of princeton engineering
got together with aerospace and said uh well okay let's let's check this out and spent 27 years
pursuing research into subtle but statistically significant effects of human intention and emotion
on both electronic and mechanical ostensibly random systems so like um you know there's that
that uh you drop balls down into the pet like a matrix of pegs and you can see the distribution
as the balls fall to one side you get like a bell curve distribution but they found that you could
have people sit in front of one of those and will the balls to the right or the left
and that you could do the same thing with uh pseudo random electronic number generators and so
some people were better at this than other people and that this is a skill that could be trained
like that that you can actually you have a small but statistically significant uh impact of willpower
on the outcome of things like dice and they they ran hundreds and hundreds of experiments
with thousands of subjects over 27 years and ran metastatistical analyses on these results
and found that basically you know they they they anticipated all of the criticism they were fiercely
attacked even by you know other departments inside of princeton engineering and so they
they had to tighten it up and you know like people like Russell Targ and Dean Raiden
that work in parapsychology understand the enormous pressure that they are under to be
as rigorous as possible and so you see things like Larry Dawsey's work on the healing power of
prayer where they've done triple blind research where like the people that are actually they
did triple blind research on on prayer and fertility where the people that were receiving
the prayer and the doctors in the fertility clinic none of them were aware that this was being done
and so like they they know that there are a higher uh you know that they have to they have to
you know pole vault over a higher bar and often a lot of the parapsychological research is
cunning methodologically in ways that normal research doesn't have the responsibility to be
and so princeton engineering you know found that uh you know they they were like look in order for
these results to be uh insignificant we would have had to have buried like something like hundreds
of millions of negative results like we would have had to hide more research than we ever had
time to conduct by orders of magnitude and so yeah so there's like but this is a case where they
still don't know why it works you know and so or at least they don't maybe the maybe the CIA people
do but but they you know they they didn't they didn't lead with well we don't know how it works
they led with is there something here and if there is something here at that point we can start I
mean that's that's how science should work right is like yeah exactly anomaly and then then you
start to create hypotheses about what you're actually observing when you have unlimited money to research
shit that you don't know what the outcome is going to be you're you can discover there's no end to
what you can discover I just had a guy in here last week he's a a professor of the history of religion
and from Texas Jeff Kreipel yes you know him yeah so Jeff Kreipel was the PhD advisor for Eric Davis
okay and he's yeah he's done yeah he's an interesting dude he he was explaining to me how
a an aerospace gravitational propulsion engineer hit him up and asked him to meet at MIT and talk
about religion and the history of Catholic nuns levitating mm-hmm like why like a JPL a J I think
that was from JPL like a JPL aeronautics propulsion guy is interested in a professor of the history
of religion like what a crazy combination yeah I mean that's just like like those guys have no limit
to what they can look into and what they can study and what they can research like who knows what
the f*** they've they've figured out you know I mean I think one of the first episodes of
viewers I listened to was the interview you did with Diana Posulka you know and I love I love her
and Kreipel for this reason is that you know you get to a point where people know that you're
sympathetic to weird and so they start like you know I yeah Kreipel has that whole book what is
the flip where he you know it's like so many 70 different reputable physicists who would only speak
to him on under the condition of anonymity yeah because they were in the closet about the fact that
they no longer believe in materialism you know that they they're idealists they believe that
consciousness is primary and that matter is like an optical illusion of consciousness yes and this
is something that you know you go back to I just interviewed Neil Thies who's an NYU pathologist
who wrote a book about complexity science and non-duality that's the next episode of future
fossils and he talks about this about how you know a lot of physicists even among the quantum
physicists Neil's boar famously was one of these these people that decided that the metaphysical
implications of modern physics are that consciousness is primary and this is hugely debated still
right like it's it's a it's it's one of these things that as Neil talks about in his work
is obvious to someone who has done the you know a certain amount of phenomenological research
into the nature of their own minds and it's completely unobvious to everyone else and so
you know looping back around to this conversation about what science is you know like well you
know you have these incredibly strongly convergent robust agreements about the nature of consciousness
coming from different schools of inquiry you know like Western Christian esotericism you know
Advaita Vedanta Hinduism Kashmir Saivist Judaism you know Zen Buddhism etc like all of them
are saying something similar enough that it sounds like it could be the same thing about
you know the actual nature of reality but the amount of work it takes to get to
verifying those claims is equivalent in terms of a time and energy investment and equivalent in
terms of you know the need to be supported by a community of expert practitioners to something
like making claims about the mathematical basis for wave particle complementarity like it's
it's like you're talking about you're asking a lot of someone to be able to be both an advanced
physicist and an advanced meditator you know and so there's like you know there therein lies
the tension between people that are claiming that matter is the basis of reality versus people
that are claiming consciousness is the basis of reality yeah there's a lot of friction between
those yeah it's like why not both pork in the list us you know yeah right right I want to get back
to what we were talking about with the people that were trying you guys like stuff like similar
to what Andrew Gallamo was trying to do like yeah map the DMT world or like like do the extended
states psychedelic trips and figure out what that is yeah what what have you found out about that
and what kind of stuff are you researching in regards to this studies these studies well yeah so
you know one of the big things I'm excited about working with no analytics is that okay so a few
years ago I gave this presentation at the diverse intelligences summer institute which is a really
fascinating kind of transdisciplinary congress of people working in all different fields of
research you know machine learning animal behavior human cognition
evolutionary biology and then they have storytellers also it's not just scientists it's also you
know authors and artists and philosophers and so my friends Jacob Foster and Erica Cartmull
who are at IU Bloomington now run this program every summer at the University of St. Andrews in
Scotland and it was during COVID so we had to do this remotely but I got to participate a couple
years ago and gave a part of a working group that was interested in questions about what they call
agnostic biosignature detection or like an in astrobiology the notion that we're looking for
life on the basis of a certain idea right life is yeah you know that life is carbon based or that
life you know requires water or like all of these things and they send radio signals right they send
yeah exactly like in all of you've had gallimore on you've had Andrew gallimore you know talking about
the transcension hypothesis and like all of this interesting stuff about uh well in what way you
know astrobiology is like the perfect and and origins of life which is very related um our
disciplines in in science that stare right down the into the the barrel you know like they're
looking directly into the abyss of what it is that we think we know and uh you know how can we
challenge those assumptions to you know to uh dilate the aperture of our inquiry right and so
like this this uh you know you can find this slideshow um diverse aliens these are my contributions
to this this larger presentation this group presentation on how um not only you know not
only are there hard limits like this fantastic 1999 paper that uh lachman newman and more uh wrote
on the physical limits of communication which says that any optimally encoded electromagnetic
communication is mathematically provable as indistinguishable from black body radiation so
like this means that if an alien civilization is smarter than us and wants to encrypt its radio
communications we will never know because it will look to us like the noise like it'll look like
cosmic background radiation to us right you know and so there is you know there are all of these uh
again like these are fundamental epistemic issues in life detection and so you know there are things
about study right which are just kind of hilariously weird like the fact that we are looking for uh you
know it's been it's been over uh 20 years it's been 25 years since this paper came out and yet
you know the dominant paradigm of of biosignature detection is that we are you know looking for waves
like you know rays that are being passed from alien to alien um and for whatever reason we are
systematically ignoring people like chris bledso right like the bledso family who are you know
who are saying like i don't think he's being ignored well i mean no i mean a lot of people
are paying attention but it's interesting who's not a lot of interesting people are paying
attention it's really interesting who is paying attention to that guy tell me more i don't know
if you watched the podcast or not but he's like surrounded by spooks yeah that well yeah so again
again one of these questions of like uh at the same time nasa astrobiology which is a fantastic
group of scientists is not paying attention to them you know and why is that and again maybe they are
well there was a couple guys openly a couple people that are really deep according to him
a couple of at least one guy who is like very very deep lifelong into nasa is like was like
very very interested in him and spent a lot of time with him the guy who like likes to stay
complete he was anonymous yeah yeah uh yeah but so go right about him yeah she calls him
tyler deep right and jeff kripel met this guy too yeah but you know it's interesting so like
years ago i painted at an event at the nasa aims facility in california and it was a big party
held by for yuri's night you know celebrating the the first orbital human you know mission and
afterwards i i talked a little bit to the nasa film crew that was on the attachment to document
this party being held in their aircraft hangar and i was like so you guys have seen some stuff right
and they're like oh yeah oh yeah we have but like but but there is a um but you can't write that stuff
into a line item for an nsf grant right like that funding on that kind of stuff is coming from a
different DARPA a different you know arm different pocketbook and like i know a ton of people that
work in astrobiology that are actually significantly more open-minded about this stuff and where we
could be looking then they are academically allowed to be like diana has talked about you know like
that she has to maintain a kind of you know a performance of academic like an ironic distance
from her research when she's talking to other religious scholars you know that she can't she
can't talk about what she actually thinks is going on she can only talk about it through
you know a kind of anthropological curiosity about other people's weird beliefs you know and so
like whatever yeah and a lot of people are constrained in this way um but yeah so the point
is that like this stuff is you know if you're honest about the science we know for instance that
that around the age of five months your brain starts screening out certain things that you're
seeing right and that yeah so they yeah this is what gallimore was talking about too right it's a
filter your senses are filters percept perceptual filters and and masking and so there are things
that you can do like take psychedelics that overwhelm those those processes so to put it
in like a machine learning language um you your brain has is running prediction algorithms that
are overfit to training data and therefore fail at predicting out-of-sample data they fail at
predicting stuff that is like you know like after a certain age you can look straight at
something that is unlike what you saw in the first year of your life and not and not even see it
and so there are ways that we have learned to systematically hack around these these filters
and so this is why the use of psychedelics as a scientific instrument strikes me as so important
and in particular important to questions that are you know prosecuting the the status the ontological
status of these weird things like you know mantises or whatever that keeps showing up in people's
trips you know so like again there's mantises show up in what kind of trips oh man my my friend
Stuart Davis who uh we won't have time to go into my own bevy of UFO experiences on this show
probably but like my buddy Stuart Davis who's a a member of that integral philosophy community in
Colorado that I spent some time in uh and a fantastic singer-songwriter came out of the
closet several years ago as a more or less lifelong experiencer or contactee and started a podcast
called Aliens and Artists that the whole thing is archived now and you can go back and you can
listen to my my recount of various experiences that I've had and start with his though because
his are really profound like he and his family had you know and I maybe continue to have years and
years of interaction like the blood sows with these beings that were kind of bothering them every
night at 3 a.m. would like show up outside their house and he jokes about how his wife got to the
point where she was just like I've got stuff to do in the morning I don't care I wish they would
just leave us alone like it ceased being interesting to his wife it like he and his daughter became
annoying found it really interesting because they were like what is this and so Stuart and I
joked that there's every married couple has one of each you know that like like some of my earliest
UFO experiences were with my wife but she was just sort of like I don't know what I don't know what
been to file this under and I have stuff to do and so like you know it's funny like society is
kind of made of these two different groups right you have the people that are very very good at
getting stuff done it goes back to that explore exploit trade-off there are some people that are
very efficient very good at staying on a to-do list you know they and they run the world and then
you have the artists and people who are brilliant but they can't get funding you know you have people
that are highly creative because their brains are very noisy they're easily distracted but they're
paying more attention to the stuff in the periphery you know and like the question is how do you get
these two people that have completely different heuristics they have different values for what
what qualifies as a worthy you know like is something worth pursuing or not and the the
lateral thinking weirdos are the ones that tend to make the observations that precipitate scientific
revolutions but they you know they have a hard time like like I'm late every single month to
file my invoice for contract work because I just like I just don't you know like you hear people
like stories of like the Claude Shannon who invented information theory and how when he was at Bell Labs
he never like he forgot to cash his checks you know this is just like so preoccupied with like
you know chasing the ambulance I think it's good to have a a spouse that is like different than you
in that in that sense like it keeps you balanced keeps you from basically like losing your footing
right it keeps you from falling down yeah the slippery slope yes so Nikki I think it's healthy
thank you so you when did you start having these kinds of experiences
my first UFO experiences were as a kid but then they really came they became pronounced
as an adult after I got out of college and it's interesting because like you know there is a
there's a there's a through line in the parapsychological research literature
and in lore in in like you know going back hundreds of years stories of poltergeists
and other weird sort of haunting phenomena that concentrate in the homes of emotionally
disturbed teenagers or people that are like at points in their life where things where they're
in an epistemic crisis they're in a they're in a crisis about like what do I do with my life
you know who am I what is this they there may be trauma involved yes and and it's these moments
where the story has been disrupted what my you know Doug Rushkoff another big inspiration of
mine calls it narrative collapse these moments you know like like the 30 years war or like what
we're going through right now with this information in the post-truth era where again like it's like
the internet is a psychedelic that is operating on all of human civilization at one time like rather
than you take acid actually let me show you this uh see tech ethics as psychedelic parenting is the
talk I gave a few years ago um you're a very fast googler oh thanks yeah so let's see yeah here's a
slideshow uh got it where do I oh yeah so this is from uh the that famous lsd functional connect
no the psilocybin functional connectivity study that was done in london where this is you know the
graph on the left is your brain in an ordinary waking state and the graph on the right is the
functional connectivity between brain crosstalk between brain regions after eating psilocybin
mushrooms and then you look at something like this and this is the map of the worldwide web
taken a few years apart and you see the same kind of thing like as our information architecture
develops on the planet it's doing something to human systems that looks like what psychedelics are
doing to the brain wow and so like the fact that we live in a post-truth era is akin is like at
planet scale what's going on in your own brain when you're tripping and you can't you don't know
how far something is like you lose your you know you're you lose your your reality story and so yeah
so there's you know this is really I you know I have always considered um for reasons that include
the fact that like the the evolution of computing technology the evolution of biotechnology the evolution
of entertainment media and the evolution of psychedelics as a technology over the last
150 years are basically the same story you know like Doug Engelbart who uh was at ARPA and you
know a a principal player in the foundation of personal computing in the internet uh was a member
of the Institute for Advanced Studies LSD trials in 1955 you know Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak both
took acid famously as they were developing the Apple computer yeah um you know you go back and
you know the Kerry Mullis who Diana Pashulka's talking about you know like we have DNA lab
techniques to produce DNA we have the polymerase chain reaction for which he won the Nobel Prize
because he was a psychonaut and so there is this weird thing that this is another piece of you know
my fondness the reason I I tell you you should fund new anotics is because um it's you know it's
arguable that most of the modern scientific world that we live in is owed to these experiences that
people are having like even Rene Descartes okay like what we think of is like the paragon of
rational secular thinking the Cartesian plane came from a fever dream that he had um I think it was
in the Prussian well I can't remember the exact war but he was a foot soldier and he he he he caught
a fever and had this dream where an angel came to him and gave him the Cartesian plane and said
use this to conquer nature basically and like you know you've got Kekeule and the benzene
ring and like all of these famous scientific breakthrough aha moments you know like
Newton wrote more on on astrology and alchemy than he did on calculus and physics you know and so
like there there is this this weird uh inter twinkling between our engagement with mysterious
uh intelligences or kinds of you know kinds of intelligence in nature where our great ideas come
from and the development of uh you know the the like thinking about biology biological processes
as digital um or you know thinking about the digital computer and the brain as being kind of
related phenomena you know information theory as something about systems that compute you know
and so anyway like I it's just funny to me that like the you know the internet being a psychedelic
substance and then you know people having these uh psychedelic experiences where they realize that
that uh you know comp you know computation can be embodied in uh you know analog carbon based
systems you know it's all kind of connected Kerry Mullis he's interesting didn't it is
my thing about the same person is Kerry Mullis the guy who had like the huge rift with an Anthony
Fauci I don't oh god I think I think he yeah there was a whole thing you know in his later
years watching a video of him just basically shitting on Fauci wait like in the 90s or something
yeah I think you know Kerry is one of these people that ended up saying some stuff that made him
uh look kind of bad uh later on kind of the same way you know Michael Crichton became a climate
change denier toward the end of his life and like you know famously said some some kind of really
unfortunate stuff look at PD I'm sure they have a very accurate depiction of Kerry Mullis American
biochemist in recognition of his role in the invention of the polymers chain reaction technique
he shared polymerase yeah oh that's what he won the Nobel Prize for he shared the 23 or 2000 or
wow 1993 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Michael Smith awarded the Japan Prize in the same year
PCR became a central technique in biochemistry and molecular biology described by the New
York Times as highly highly original and significant virtually dividing biology into two epochs before
the PCR and after the PCR huh but yeah he was a an HIV AIDS right denier and all this stuff yeah
oh he was a denier yeah well I mean he expressed doubt that HIV was the cause of AIDS but like no
so this is an interesting case like they call it Nobel disease right which is like where you get
recognized as being an expert in something like for instance Neil deGrasse Tyson you know a brilliant
astronomer who comes out and then says stuff about how like you know philosophy is inferior to science
without realizing that like all of scientific knowledge depends on philosophy and it's just
like dude you're you're you're staying your lane you know I have no lane so I'm an expert in nothing
you have many lanes I have you know you have no lanes and infinite infinite lanes I should not be
uh you know I I hope that I'm merely pointing people to authoritative sources uh and not not
you know professing to be one but this happens a lot you know and people people get asked uh
that you know they become known as experts and it's because we have this really impoverished
understanding of expertise that we think oh somebody's an expert so we can ask him anything
and they're just smarter than I am and that's not the case right you know collective intelligence is
uh fundamental but yeah you know the the UFO experiences what about them your first one
was when you were how old uh nine or ten and what was it you saw I saw a what like an orb
a kind of metallic orb floating in the sky uh with a a an equatorial belt of like rainbow
lights and the there was the the lights were kind of rotating around it and then I was in the back
seat of a car and trying to get my parents' attention and by the time they turned around it was gone
where were you Orlando wow two alfamare yeah and then the most recent one I saw was outside of
San Marcos Texas and probably a human craft like if I'm gonna if I'm gonna place a bet
on something it was about 20 feet wide triangular object with um green lights on each wing tip
and flatter than it could be to keep a person inside of it but it was floating about 100 feet
off the ground over a crowd of 300 people it was it was observed multiply by me and a bunch of my
friends on the ground and we watched it for about a minute and it floated up wind over the the crowd
in the stage until it was over the tree line we couldn't see it anymore but it was like it was
the wind was clearly blowing in the opposite direction and it was going upwind at about
the speed of the wind maybe five miles an hour what do you think it is about people I think it's
so funny that people that have UFO experiences have many of them there's I've never found anyone
who's just like seen one UFO and it ended there like they all will have multiple experiences
and a history of experiences from childhood on yeah you know I mean that was a that was a question
that Stuart Davis pursued in his podcast and Aliens and Artists you know he talked to hundreds of
observers and one of the one of the patterns that they all had in common was that it was uh
it was heritable you know that there there seemed to be some sort of thing where it's like you know
my mom has seen them and her mom and and like the story kind of changes over time you know it's like
200 years ago my parents were talking about fairies right but it's this you know you look at the
kind of course features of this thing and it's the same over generations and so yeah again it
gets to this question about uh human cognition right and like you know another thing that's
heritable um I uh I have some friends in common with Josh Schreie who's the host of the Emerald
podcast out of also out of Santa Fe and Josh just did a really spectacular two-episode
feature on Sears through societies over time and how you know things like the Delphic Oracle
right in ancient Greece or in you know the medicine people in various tribal groups across the
planet you know that Sears have been held through most cultures over time as having a special suite
of cognitive faculties that make them usefully different as navigators of stuff that is not
really well understood or known to everyone else and that you know in in our our effort to you know
to squelch and stamp out various pre-modern superstitions in the modern era um you know like
for instance um you know the pharmacological research is coming around to validating in its own
way with its own methods a lot of the supposedly BS you know witchcraft style like herbal medication
herbal medicine you know a lot of these folk traditions were uh were you know correct in
their understanding that certain kinds of herbs work for certain kinds of ailments
and we just we just drowned all those people or burned them and now we're coming back around to
like okay wait a minute and I think something like that is happening right now with um let me give you
an example here I love this paper that just came out this weekend um this hallucination is inevitable
an innate limitation of large language models where they basically say uh that this feature of
language models which is that you know they generative tools will produce stuff that's just
really weird like we can't iron out um you know like certain uh you know like if you prompt chat
GPT and then it gives you some sort of BS response like you know they warn you you got to fact check
this stuff you can't just assume that uh GPT is telling you the truth right you know so but like
it turns out that this you know this paper makes the case that something like that is uh we're never
gonna completely get rid of hallucination in machine learning what is the google one called
again Gemini Gemini yeah that's Gemini what you look like it'll you'll look like a 600 pound
black woman but yeah there's there's that there's all of that yeah so again like it's you know what
is what is what has a given inference algorithm been trained on and in that's so fucking weird
man in that respect uh you know this this notion that goes back to like you know Roland Fisher and
all of these people in the middle of the 20th century that consciousness is basically sense
constrained you know what we think of as the waking mind um not consciousness in the way that like
the non dual traditions use it which is ontologically prior to mental activity but um that that mind
is you know the waking life is is sense constrained dreaming is sense constrained hallucination and
so that's what they're saying with these language models is that you know so like what what's
interesting about this with respect to Josh Shry and Sears and so on is that um again we want to
combine uh low noise and high noise systems as complementary in our efforts to try and understand
the world and so you know to the extent that somebody like Gregory Bateson said you know
information is the difference that makes a difference it's like uh we're actually doing
ourselves like you were saying earlier about creativity like the human creative process
and machine learning and how like if we go too far down this route of just eating and constantly
regurgitating and then re-eating these uh you know the the generative media goes back into
you know tuning the language models and then we end up further and further down the whole of our
yeah of our training biases yeah you know but at the same time like we can um you know we can we
use language models the way that the ancient Greeks used the Delphic Oracle or like the way
that you can cast the each hangar read the tarot or or you know read tea leaves or whatever there
it's again it's about injecting randomness into a system so that you are you are uh knocking yourself
out of the rut of being over fit on your the reality model that you're using at any given time
and so like what excites me about uh you know a lot of the really savvy people that have been
talking about AI for years like Kevin Kelly who uh I've had on the show three times he's the founding
editor of wired magazine and brilliant technologist and he he was saying even as far back as the 90s
that trying to reproduce the human mind with AI is not interesting because we already have human
minds and that what's actually really interesting is finding uh kinds of inference or kinds of
intelligence that are meaningfully distinct from our own that like we're like you know AI we are
making alien minds that can tell us something about us that we don't already know in the way
that like learning to communicate with dolphins for instance is going to radically expand our
our view of the world and so like again like you know when it comes to SETI there's like three
stances there's you know let's look out into space for life there's let's look into our own
phenomenal experience with psychedelics and then there's this other thing which is going on with
groups like the interspecies internet uh interspecies.io which is like co-founded by vent surf and
Peter Gabriel it's a fascinating project um what is it about it's about using machine learning to
create a translation layer between humans and non-humans so like learning to communicate with
dolphins and apes and and corvids and other kinds of creature with uh with AI so that you have you
know like the like an up you know the dog's got the the the translation collar yeah that stuff is
like an inch away from us right now I was gonna have Karen Bacher on the show Karen uh passed away
last year tragically but she was a brilliant eco-acoustician what is the name of this uh
interspecies.io um but yeah Karen worked on the you know using machine learning she wrote a book
called the sounds of life about using machine learning to decode the communication of everything
from like whales and turtles to coral it turns out like all kinds of life use sound to communicate
that we didn't even realize until just a couple years ago um and so yeah there's this whole explosive
field right now of uh eco-acoustics empowered by by AI so that you know like within a very
short time we're going to be talking to all kinds of non-human animals and then we have an ethical
question about like whether we should um whether we you know whether it's it's responsible for us
to in like there are issues of like informed consent like should we should we really be giving
should we really be like in the position to sell dolphins instagram ads and stuff like that that
seems like a really bad idea because it's like they're like children like they don't like you
know should you really let your kids just watch youtube without parental supervision no and and
anyway so this is you know I I just love the idea of like oh oops it turns out that you know we
thought that AI was going to be good for like missile guidance and stuff like this the real
feature of AI the really interesting thing that it's going to turn out to be most useful for
is helping us reconnect to this more sort of diverse relationship to mind and intelligence that
makes our uh our explorations of the cosmos inherently plural I like the last thing I think
I had I pulled up that I wanted to show you is this talk I gave a couple years ago about pluralism
and it gets it gets back to this this um there's a ton of good links in here um the six minute talk
on on all of the different ways that people independently decided that pluralism was the
correct basis for asking you know deep questions about reality and so yeah so like you know again
you know like there's an there's a ton on the table uh right now like what we stand to learn
if we do manage to kind of like reliably open discourse with different forms of
non-human intelligence be they terrestrial uh organisms be they machine intelligences be they
you know interdimensional ET type things or whatever um every every new I mean there's like
I guess like the way to the way to put it is like the term alien has not always meant the same thing
right like there are people that call people crossing the border through Mexico aliens right
alien just means beyond the horizon of my own sense of self right it just it's it's a it's an
adjective that we apply to the things that are exotic to our own understanding of the world
and so alien used to mean people living five miles away from you you know and and maybe in
another hundred years alien will mean you know something that currently lies so far beyond
the scope of our comprehension you know we will not consider uh you know the octopus to be an alien
form of intelligence anymore you know because we will be well we will have been brain linked to
octopi through you know brain computer interfaces for a hundred years so it'll seem like your
neighbor you know in like the latent space of possible minds that's crazy to think about I mean
imagine I mean even if the the work that the interspecies IO people are doing with using
these models to decipher animal communication I mean imagine if we were able to somehow link
the minds of people from different parts of the world like different countries and like
like I just think imagine how that would upset the balance of nations around the world if it
wasn't just like if you don't just have like these people at the very top of the pyramid
communicating with each other and then the people below or just sort of like are just passive right
if this thing becomes ubiquitous and people like you and me are able to tap into what people are
thinking and communicate with you know people in other cultures that speak different languages
around the world I wonder that how that would it change the global balance and like how that would
make uh when you think about you know superpowers and military might like how that would make that
obsolete maybe in a way because we're in the middle of it I mean I so 189 at Future Fossils I
interviewed Parag Khanna who's kind of a famous a best-selling futurist author I used to write for
his blog at bigthink.com and he's spent a ton of time on this question you know this this book
that he and I discussed about a year ago or maybe two years ago move yeah the force is uprooting us
he's talking about how you know the increasingly interconnected global economy is dissolving
national borders and you know a lot of what we see as this sort of counter force where people are
like nationalism is having kind of a moment right now but it's because the actual larger
historical trend is in the other direction and you know I I I am I'm not as unrepentant a globalist
as Parag Khanna is because I also see the way that you know that as boundaries collapse you
know things become more and more unstable and unpredictable and it's not at all clear to me
that we're moving into something that can be simply described as like a kind of global system
you know like the internet like everyone's pulling out of social media because it's not safe anymore
like the way that there was a UC Santa Barbara study on fisheries mass capture fishing a few
years ago showing that as we've gotten better and better at at net trawling large schools of fish
schools of fish have evolved to be smaller because they avoid the attention of these fisheries
because they're swimming in smaller groups they're not it's a it's a diminishing marginal return on
on fishing cost and so something like that is happening right now in the surveillance economy
where people are sick of being preyed upon in you know in these enormous herds of willing flesh
online and are pulling out and like you know the the new social media experience is one that's much
more like campfire scale than global scale and so like as forces pull in other directions right
opposite directions all the time but the point that parag was making was that
as things have become more and more globalized voluntary military participation has dropped
profoundly that like people like voluntary young people no longer want to join the army because
they no longer identify as national citizens on average as much as they used to they no longer
have a fealty to you know any a given country they have on you know on average more of a fealty
to being of a particular generation yes and or you know identifying as global citizens my buddy Sam
Barton who is a dear friend of mine let's see what was that Sam Barton global citizen he's working
on a project global citizenship global citizens united is a project he's working on with a few
people to try and kind of advance this notion of global citizenship from the bottom up and so yeah
I mean there are these you know parag talks about there being you know that we have a moral imperative
to open our borders more because you know the demographic shifts in the population are making
it so that we're going to run out of elder care you know like Japan is already struggling large
parts of Europe are already struggling to with like replacement and so people are running out of
you know options for domestic labor and for the care of the elderly and this kind of thing and so
we're going to have to you know like a society needs new blood in it and if we're if our reproductive
rates continue to drop because of the the systems dynamics of the demographic shift into urban living
then we're going to have to replace that not with children from a given country but from you know
immigrant movement that's that's a good point that this guy I was listening to a podcast with
John Mirsheimer and Lex Friedman had him on it was a guy's incredible he was talking about
that specifically in regards to immigration from Mexico and South America and like how
important it is like that and also I think from like Asian countries that a huge chunk I think
more than ever of young people are that are currently reproducing the people that reproduce the most
that are immigrants from those countries that are keeping our replenishing our population and
keeping it from declining and if it wasn't for all that immigration our population would be plummeting
like at a way larger rate. Yeah I mean you know Parag's observation is that we are actually you
know like a lot of people think about this sort of hockey stick exponential curve you know but
most systems most complex systems have a negative feedback built into them somewhere where you
actually get what they call sigmoidal curve which is like s-shaped and you reach carrying capacity
and then things check that so like it's not that we're going to you know like most people with a
basis in ecology are less concerned about you know a system you know doing some sort of insane
thing where it just I mean this is a complicated topic but like there's the best perhaps introduction
I can think of to this topic is the conversation I just had with physicist Jeffrey Weston and
ecologist Mountford evolutionary biologist Mountford lobby clerk and they look at this
innovation technological innovation and they say basically like we were talking about earlier about
like innovating like discovering new energy resources or new material resources for manufacturing
and that it creates a crisis it exports some some some new kind of externalities some kind of new
kind of waste and or it exports you know in making a system more predictable and more controllable
you export chaos and disorder and then that chaos and disorder doesn't just disappear forever it
eventually comes back and bites you in the ass and so you can look at the history of technological
innovation as a history of constantly kicking this catastrophe a little further down the road
but that the crisis comes back even faster as the systems become more and more complex and
unpredictable because they're generating more and more novelty and so west talks about the finite
time singularity which is this moment that we can no longer adapt with new innovations at the pace
of the new kinds of disorder that we have to understand predict control manage and so you know
at that point west is predicting you know something like the collapse of civilization
but one of the things that we get into in this in this conversation is how
um it's it may it may be actually that uh we just kind of hit a wall and that things don't collapse
that they kind of just taper off and so you know paroch says the same kind of thing he's like
you know what were we thinking you know that we were gonna we were you know there are all of these
checks and balances that come in like people can't afford to have kids so like reproduction
does not just continue to grow exponentially forever you get to a point where you can't
afford a house and you can't afford having three kids and like that's the millennial experience
right you're like the millennial experience is we're actually starting to make choices where
we're not just mindlessly pursuing an exponential growth curve anymore um you know the the the
check mindlessly well like you know like like you know the you know the assumption that we're
just going to keep growing forever like eventually a bacterial culture growing in a petri dish hits
the wall of the dish okay you know and so like this notion that comes from the you know the the
club of Rome uh limits to growth like this famous paper in the 1970s you know talking about limits
to growth it's like the the assumption that that's going to that that necessary hitting a limit to
growth nest or overshooting a limit to growth necessarily uh results in some sort of you know
universal catastrophic collapse is not necessarily the case it's a question of the different scales
at which uh all of these different things are unfolding the different time scales at which
they're unfolding so i mean i don't know i guess i mean we're kind of on a a weird bender here but
like you know what i i think that uh the much like the collapse of unification in the sciences
doesn't necessarily mean that we give up on the quest for conciliance in our knowledge
it doesn't mean that we you know like the printing press comes out and then we go back to the stone
age you know it's like no we hit a new we we hit a new plateau and then it takes some time for us
to figure out how to grow beyond that that plateau i don't know i mean these are these are very uh
these are very complex questions but i don't think that we are um i don't i don't think that we are
necessarily at a point where the on one side of the curve we all go up into space and live forever
and on the other side the only other possibility is that we end up bombing ourselves back to the
stone age like there's definitely a third thing yes in there probably a few different things yeah
yeah yeah back to your UFO stories what uh what other kind of experiences did you have anything any
other kind of experiences other than seeing objects in the sky did you have any like encounters with
beings or anything oh yeah for sure i mean for sure yeah but i mean again okay like let me just
bracket this by saying that uh i i believe in maintaining a kind of skeptical humility
about all of the weird experiences that i've had um they i've had them i've had enough of them to
find them interesting and worthy of serious pursuit you know a genuine effort to try and
understand something but i think that you know that anyone who believes that they know what's
going on has failed whether they believe on the side of you know this does not exist or on the
side of like this does exist and i know what's going on and in fact one of the more interesting
uh pieces of writing i've seen on this is again by my buddy steward davis who wrote
a piece on the phenomenon as control system or developmental driver uh where he says yeah this
piece oh advanced well let's just proceed uh you know where he says you know is the UFO phenomenon
and sort of all these related parapsychological phenomena uh maybe like does it maybe exist
gene this uh where a game is a game it's a song of his he loves exploring the shadow the
psychological shadow in his work but he he writes this piece where he basically asks
um is the UFO a kind of deception that is you know malevolent like you know are we being
controlled by an intelligence greater than our own that's preying on us in some way or is it a call
forward into a higher logical order like is the fact that these things are so hard to define
or that they seem so elusive or slippery um you know that that they they escape our attempts to
nail them down into you know an easy kind of category um is this perhaps actually the feature
again like is this actually is this not a bug of what we're observing but is this actually the point
that uh we're being called to reconstitute our cosmology at a higher logical order that is not
merely sort of a duality a dualistic kind of thinking and the you know the last thing I'd say
on that before we go back to story time about my UFO experiences is that um I talked about this with
with Sean with Sean S. Bjorn Hargens my graduate advisor on future fossils and we spend a lot of
time you know kind of he looks at how 200 different cultures and and academic disciplines have
investigated the UFO phenomenon and the conclusions that they've come to and one of the things that
he he basically says is that you know the the through line on all of this stuff is that you
know Jacques Vallée talks about this and and many others that um the through line is that it seems
to be Carl Jung wrote about this if if we can say anything about this phenomenon it's that it
it interrogates the modern boundary between the mind and the rest of reality and that you
know that there seems to be a sense in which the horizon of our understanding is is on this
sort of you know the psychophysical nature of things and so you know how do we how can we
how can we do better science you know with a you know a kind of like interior seti you know
an etnoenotic seti how can we do um science that helps us adapt the philosophy of science
to a networked digital era like how can we how can we update the the philosophical underpinnings
of scientific inquiry so that we can adequately deal with issues of mind matter complementarity
or of the the challenges in reproducibility for psychological experiments and so on
and so with with all of that said you know there is a sort of sense in which these experiences
pollute or challenge or compromise our attempts at objective material description
and so like one of the things that I've decided I'm just not going to bother doing
is to try and claim that any of my experiences should convince someone to believe in this stuff
but you know with that said like I was in Peru in 2011 for ayahuasca ceremony and
in a really unusual situation where the 17 of us that went down together were all separated
and led through our ayahuasca ceremonies as a kind of initiatic or deal alone like intentionally
separated from one another rather than in a more kind of traditional circle you know ceremony setting
and all 17 of us separated and out of contact with one another through ceremony all saw these weird
sort of mantis like black chrome kind of aliens that appeared to us each individually
and when the next morning we all came back and we were like oh you saw that too
like what and in my case the these beings that you know kind of did ran through the whole
kind of classic gamut of behavior including you know psychic surgery on you like you know
it's they're like opening up your your energy body and operating on your your subtle energy
systems or whatever um so that I had that experience and I had the experience of how
how old were you when you did that 27 wait yes 27
2000 yeah 2011 this was the week before the Fukushima reactor
collapse we came back to civilization like we came out of the jungle and went to a hostile
outside of Puerto Maldonado and the first thing we saw on tv was the coverage of the
reactor meltdown and we were like oh because like the whole thing was like you know it's like
you go through the the experience but then the work really starts when you get back right right
and so like that was the joke on us because you're like oh god introduction yeah oh god right we
live in the world you know now and now you know where is the boundary you know because cesium
won 37s in your tuna um but like you know so there's that's that's another weird thing about this
phenomenon right is that the intense correlation between the UFO phenomenon and nuclear technology
you know and I know you've talked with a ton of people about this on the show and and the the
intense curiosity that these these unidentifiable craft appear to have about nuclear missile
stations and so on but like so um yeah there's there's something really curious about that but
like the the beings that I saw in ceremony that that year were trying to explain to me I mean again
like this is my you know this is the subjective experience I had of this was that they appeared
to me out of nowhere and I was like so how are you here you know what is this how are you showing
up to me right now like are you you know and what they were saying was that um that there are different
substrates on which life can emerge or from which life can emerge and that biochemistry organic
biochemistry is one of them but organic biochemistry represents a a specific stratum of temperature
and pressure at which life can occur and that life can occur at other pressures in other states of
matter and that their form of life occurs in plasmas that are you know they're like ionized gases
that are so hot and so uh electrically charged that organic life cannot develop from them but that
they can generate um basically like magnetic holograms and that the kinds of interactions
that are necessary for life uh can emerge out of the substrate of those holograms and so they
were basically like well you actually have this too like the the you know the living biological
systems on the planet as we conventionally understand them all have this energetic component
which is you know if you look at the work of like Irvin Laszlo or Rupert Sheldrake or some of these
other people that have been trying to understand um a new a new biology uh a lot you know a lot of
them you know puzzle into the relation of electromagnetism and uh you know quantum vacuum
holograms and so on in in the these these kind of more non-local uh and seemingly predictive
uh biological dynamics but but the the thing about they were saying is like well we have
like a material body it's just that our material body is plasma and you have a and entered you
have like a plasma body but that's not where evolution has tuned your attention or the the
has tuned your organization as uh and the encapsulation or the incarnation of an inference
a model of its environment like you live on a slow cool planet and so the focal point for you as a
living system is on this the the the you know the material the chemical substrate whereas we
are too hot for chemistry but we are holograms made out of the magnetic interactions of heavy
metals at the center of the galaxy and so like we can appear to you through the non-linear
interactions of uh you know our sort of subtle body and yours but this is where we like we don't
occupy time and space in the same way that you do because of you know the fact that our our experience
is centered on a different you know that the emergent interactions of a different phase of
matter i was like oh okay all right cool you know um noted yeah noted noted so like but they were
they were basically like look there's nothing supernatural about this there's nothing um
you know this is this is not this is the same physics that you have this is the same you know
this is the same uh substrate for for biology on a very general level but um but like you can't
like your eyeball would dissolve instantaneously if you tried to like actually physically co-locate
with us and you know the only way that we're able to appear to you is kind of like remotely through
this this uh spooky action at a distance or whatever did it seem like they were far more
advanced than we are technologically i mean or what is technology more enlightened than we were
where they a superior being to us it can and can this communication have happened in the
reversal role like can they somehow experience us in the same way you experience them i mean so i
i don't know if you have time to ask this question yeah i wonder about i mean technology again you
know i i tend to think of things in a very very general way where uh you know like one of my
favorite papers is this this piece multiple paths to multiple life my friend chris kempis
led a few years ago and there's a great let me see if i can find this figure in this paper
oh yeah where they're talking about like we tend to think at layer one here life as a space of
material possibilities but then there's layer two which is a space of physical constraints
and then there's layer three which is a space of optimization principles and so you know like
this this is a space where you know you have uh convergence on certain like you know like
information theorists are going to argue that life could exist like like the blockchain might
be alive or a national constitution might be alive or memes might be alive and memes like my
again jacob foster the friend of mine who co leads the diverse intelligence the summer institute
gave a great presentation a couple years ago on uh death metal as a kind of parasitic organism
that exists on the substrate of human brains he was just giving death metal as a as a joke example
but like ideas are information patterns that propagate from one human brain or human mind
to another and so there is a sense in which you can argue that you know something like uh
you know a god uh in a more kind of modern information theoretical sense is a pattern of
neural firing activity and behavioral activity that we see in uh like entire groups of human
beings and in our relationship to each other through various technological media and so
you know like batman this is something i talk about with shawn in that episode 150 of future
fossils that like you know um this is like neil gayman and american gods you know like the
story about you know where what what are gods really gods are ideas that people have and enact
through their behavior so like batman is like a thing batman has a physical footprint of merchandise
and you know the information of like batman movies stored on netflix servers and like this kind of
stuff um and so that's a thing that's a thing that exists in space and time in the way that
philosopher timothy morton who's at rice university with jeff kripal um tim morton calls them hyper
objects you know it's like it's so big that we can't really see it as a single thing like climate
change is a thing but it's a hyper object that we're embedded in and so we can only catch glimpses
of it and like the ufo might be a hyper object you know it might be it might be something that exists
in some weird way both kind of beyond us and inside of us and that we're sitting here like
scratching our silly monkey heads trying to make sense of it but that it's there it's there in the
way that uh you know that that uh christianity is you know that like christ you know historically
who knows may have been a physical person but christ is definitely a real thing in that there
enough people believe in christ and christ influences their their relation their actual
behavior in the world you know and so like what is uh you know what is an idea what is a technology
you know what is uh you know what what is life and um you know are we are we basically
you know ideas that are you know like are we like memes that that's you know like a 19th century
a natural history illustrator Ernst Heckel who's like the legendary science illustrator of all time
there's a great documentary about his work called Proteus where he talks a lot about his study of
physical of biological form as a study of the ideas in the mind of god as kind of like platonic
like that physical you know like biological organisms and like the the various forms that we
see in nature uh throughout the tree of life are are like ideas that god is having and that you
know god's brain is like physical reality and and so on and i think that's just a really a really
elegant um beautiful system for the contemplation of transcendent weird notions but um i don't i
don't know how to answer your question about like are they more or less advanced because um
you know i mean it i don't know have you every time you experienced things like this was it all
under the influence of things like ayahuasca or psilocybin or things like that or no i definitely
definitely had sober but i mean again like what is what is sobriety right sobriety what is sobriety
because your brain it's a hyper object well like you know macanus talked about this and so has uh
you know salvador deli said i don't do drugs i am drugs you know like the modern molecular biochemical
approach to human cognition is that you are made out of psychoactive substances yeah you know so
like what is sober like you can't you can't get away from um you know being under the influence
of something anymore than whether it's endogenous chemicals or endogenous chemicals right right
so bags of chemicals walking around right so you never in a constant state totally you just have
you know one kind of intoxication that people take for granted as normal versus other kinds
that are less normal and perhaps less socially interoperable right like yeah you know you're
you're gonna have trouble feeding yourself if you're ramana maharshi and you're in a kind of
advanced meditative state all the time and and so you don't have a perception of your ego like
was that jill bolty taylor who had my stroke of genius she had a she had a uh a hemis a left
hemispheric stroke she has a famous ted talk about it like that she had a kind of a non-dual
samadhi like you know she had a moment of awakening um where her boundary around herself
dissolved and she didn't experience herself as separate from the cosmos but she also kept
forgetting to call 911 because she was just like so like captivated by everything that she forgot
that she had she was in the middle of an emergency you know so again like there are there's got to
be some kind of utility to um certain kinds of intoxication that allow us to meaning you know
to see things differently but um you know there's a reason that there are probably fewer artists
per capita than there are bankers or whatever you know like we on average we we need to remember that
you know we have to remember to eat mm-hmm yeah it's similar to uh jeff kripal wrote a book
changed in a flash i don't know if you heard of that one but it's about this lady elizabeth
crone i think her name was she uh she got struck by lightning and then she basically like recounts
this whole experience of like after she got struck by lightning she was going to church with her kids
she went inside the church to get a doctor and it was a uh what's it called it was a Jewish church
so it was full of synagogue synagogue yeah and they were all doctors and they all came and helped her
and then she turned around to go back outside and she saw herself laying there on the floor on the
ground like dead and then she followed some light into some other garden she explained she saw and
then she purposely didn't follow the light she was in this garden communicating with her dead
grandfather for like two weeks straight and then she decided to go back into her previous body or
previous space time and then she recounts all of this and then she had like all these
precognitive abilities after this and she was able to predict things or like new people were
going to die the day before they died and and all this crazy stuff and and um you know all all these
i see just like such a pattern between some of this these ufo experiences and these near
death experiences and makes me like curious to whether you know when it even comes to people like uh
wittly streiber or chris bledsoe like all this stuff is is just inside you maybe not as it may
not be external well it may just not be that that you know inside you means what we think it means
yeah right like it's you know this this room is inside you in some sense you know like again
like this is why i love the the methodological pluralist approach to this this stuff it's like
okay in one sense of the word inside this stuff is arising in your awareness and in another sense
of the word inside you're sitting in the room where this is happening and those are two different
ways you know we're using the same word but they're they mean two very different things
and you know so i think a lot of you know a lot of what we're dealing with right now is
a demand for the evolution of our language you know that like what we're gonna you know in the
same way that my interest in all of this stuff kind of arguably came out of reading a paper about
where syntax comes from the evolution where it all started yeah the evolution of syntactic language
this paper led by martin noeck you're a recall of all these podcasts that you've recorded and all
these papers that you've read is astounding thanks yeah gobble nootropics folks that's
and a gobble crowd them and yeah but so this piece uh noeck and plotkin
and oh and crack our worked on this one too but he's got a couple uh on the evolution of language
and of syntactic communication oh here we go um oh look at that henry g worked on this episode of
this issue of nature my buddy henry anyway so uh they talk about syntax and the sentence
mm being uh something that emerged out of
a similar kind of catastrophic threshold in information production in early human society
like hominid society where you uh the complexity of society meant that we had suddenly you know a
a uh exponentially more things to communicate to one another that mattered to the cohesion of our
of our behavioral coordination and so our language which at the time was built on individual utterances
where like we didn't have sentences yet we had things like chair you know or like uh good you
know and there was no real um you know there was no way to articulate things into longer more
complex ideas the way of toddler communicates right right and and then at some point uh you get
to the you get to a level of social complexity where the the you need to remember more words than
you can basically and so at that point we go from a dynamic where you learn by adding new words to
a dynamic where you come up with a handful of simple rules where those words can be combined
to mean exponentially more things than you can actually remember and so like this is the you
know this is this has implications to the origin of life because what we're talking about and what
my friend Sarah Walker who's an astra anastra funded astrobiologist at ASU uh talks about
that life is basically the life can be defined as the processes whereby systems
generate a greater uh possibility space than the actual space of things that can happen so like
you know the notion that are that we are evolving into a deeper and deeper embrace of imagination
and possibility is actually like fundamental to what it means to be alive and what it means to be
intelligent um you know when like people talk about life as being uh you know like highly
improbable you know like the number of ways that you can put a you know molecules together to make
something and only some of them will actually lead to a reproducing cell and you know vastly
more of them won't and the question of like well how is it that we did this the famous sort of critique
of uh you know that it's like a junkyard blowing you know a tornado blowing through a junkyard
and assembling a working 747 it's like it's actually substantially worse than that but you
have people uh like my buddy Bruce Damer um or like the quantum biologist John Joe McFadden
at the University of Surrey who have interesting arguments for basically not only life being
uh you know seemingly circumventing enormous improbability but being inevitable because
that the grain of our cosmos is toward an expansion of what um complex system scientist
Stuart Kaufman calls the adjacent possible that like you know you you keep coming to these
these uh crisis points in information management in both pre biological biological and
and sort of trans or post biological systems and the solution is to invent a new syntax a new a new
order uh for articulating and recombining the the parts that allow us to model the cosmos with
adequate complexity in order to continue surviving in it and so yeah so like this this notion of um
of
we're us being at a point now in the history of the planet where subject verb object syntax is no
longer adequate to describing the reality of our experience such that we can say things like I am
in the room and the room is in me and for it to make sense intuitively rather than it to sound
like a nonsense statement um I did a there's a video on that uh folks can find on my youtube how
to resolve a paradox where you know then this is something that was communicated to me in a UFO
experience actually in 2006 where they said look if you if you uh you know like say you have a card
and on one side of the card it says the statement on the opposite side of this card is false but
then you turn the card around and on the other side of the card it says the same thing so they
can't both be right right right oh no but they can because you can spin the card and so you can
assign a relative truth value to this to these seemingly contradictory statements by adding a
dimension a dimension of time or a dimension of physical space where those things can oscillate
and that kind of oscillation is one of the core characteristics of a hyper object as defined by
Timothy Morton so like reality is a hyper object and we gain more and more accurately high more
and more adequately high dimensional understandings or models of reality by adding more dimensions
and more perspectives to our understanding which is exactly what we were talking about with like
what is science science is an open-ended process whereby more and more seemingly contradictory
dimensions are unified at the level of our understanding and our our world models and
so that actually exceeds like a third person confirmation like really I think like the new
form of science that we're going to stabilize at you know in the next in the coming decades
is a science that is comfortable with the complementarity of both quantitative and
qualitative evidence streams and has found some way to to unify them in a higher logical order
and so yeah so it gets you know all of the stuff we've been talking about today is like
how do we how do we use systems of numbers and systems of experiences stereoscopically
to train our our scientific investigations on something that is fundamentally challenging to
the idea of mind matter duality wild shit dude let's watch this video I mean sure it's kind of
yeah this is just me doing a mural on the inside of my buddy's camper but oh okay and you're just
talking about this yeah why are you doing your mural yeah I've got a ton of these time lapse
videos online with me going on about one thing or another philosophical ideas oh this was incredible
so you so you said you got that idea in a UFO experience in 2006 yeah yeah this uh the second
of four UFO experiences I had at Clinton Lake outside of the Lawrence like where I went to
school at the University of Kansas how did the idea come how did the idea get communicated to you
well it said like imagine that like we're going to use a geometric analogy
to present this to you they're like okay no imagine you have a question
no I mean how is this coming to you like just just showing up in my head while I was looking at
this UFO looking at something and this is just popping in these yeah pictures are popping into
your head or words both and it was like okay so like imagine you have a question and we're
going to say that the question is like the formal logical presentation of this question
is as a triangle the answer to the question is a tetrahedron you add another point that's off the
plane at which you can't understand what you're being asked and then you're able to observe
the two-dimensional plane from the third dimension and they're like so the the tetrahedron poses
a question that can only be answered by a four-dimensional extrapolation from that
and so like all of our you know all of our physics models are like low-dimensional encodings of the
actual complexity of reality and our the ability like the the ability of human beings to cognize
a certain number of dimensions is constrained by our evolutionary history which required us to
navigate space time at a certain level of complexity right like you don't need to know
that there are 11 dimensions because it doesn't matter to you kind of you know it doesn't matter
but maybe now it's starting to matter maybe now we have an existential demand being made on us
to understand things at a higher level of dimensionality because our our actions are suddenly
you know they have repercussions that extend into other dimensions you know and so like
there's a great book Andrew Smith this is sound kind of like what Steve you remember what Billy
Carson was showing us that video about crystals and the lady that was holding the she was holding
like the 3d thing and it casts a shadow on the ground like a 2d Chris a 2d shape yeah that was
it was a really good explanation as well it was uh what was it it was like ultra crystals or
I forgot the name quasi crystals yes yeah so uh Andrew Smith wrote Andrew P Smith wrote a book
about this called the dimensions of experience I want a book club with future fossils folks at some
point um where he says basically like an ant actually doesn't even experience three spatial
dimensions because they're so small uh it doesn't matter and they can like walk on walls and stuff
so they really only experience x and y they're physical they're experiencing physical space
is planar it's not cuboidal um and humans have gotten to a point where we you know humans and
and birds like for instance birds actually have more advanced spatial cognition than humans do
because they have to fly and so they're they're you know birds especially birds that live in
forests and other dense areas have a very advanced space like that's why corvids you know crows and
magpies and so on are so good at salt like picking locks and stuff is because they've they have to
think in 3d in order to navigate and that's why humans you know we have you know we have really
good stereoscopic vision and you know we can manipulate objects with our hands and so on
because we were living in the trees for so long you know we had that we had to swing through
yeah you know a kind of dense complicated three-dimensional space and so like by the time
we you know one of the things that um years ago uh the author of xeno linguistics which is like
one of the best books on psychedelics and and the evolution of language in the world
diana reed slattery um when she was on eric davis's show expanding mind back in the day
she talked about how like all of human language is based on us living on the surface of a planet
under one gravity one earth gravity and that language would look completely different if it
had emerged in zero gravity because you know you would think of things growing out rather than
growing up you know they would be growing out uniformly from a point right in all you know in
all directions rather than you know like the way that like george lakeoff and mark johnson write in
this metaphors we live by they write about uh you know we have this relationship in our minds
between more is up and then like you know a bigger pile of food is is like better or like sitting
upright means that you're kind of more you know you're maybe a little happier than if you're kind
of like slouched over so there's like these there are very very deep entailments between more is up
and up is better that are in our language so when we talk about the stock market we talk about it
going up when it's performing well right and we talk about it going down when it's not and like
it's really counterintuitive to try and flip it around you know one of the most interesting things
about like data visualization and like the presentation of scientific knowledge is the
way that we we take these things as inherently objective but they're actually again this is the
postmodern or linguistic turn in philosophy it's like we're actually sitting on this incredibly
deep substratum of embodied understanding that's coloring everything we take to be objective
knowledge you know so like you know like uh when people talk about getting the cold shoulder
it turns out that social rejection is registered in the brain the same place that like uh you know
like you feel physical pain from social rejection and it feels cold and people report themselves
as being colder when they're rejected and there's like a history between like you're a mammal you
slept in piles you know you were like warmer when you were like accepted by your tribe or
whatever so like our language is full of this stuff that's fast and so again like where we know
what's inside did you say crows can pick locks yeah i mean i did not i did not know that not
not every lock right but like yeah like there's fantastic crow uh let's see corvik birds are
crazy man lock picking and even like the homing pigeon like we still haven't figured out how the
homing pigeon oh it's so strange yeah let's see oh yeah here we go lock picking ravens what the
i mean and they will work together so how do they do this i mean these are there are all
kinds of experiments into this into crow raven magpie cognition but they'll work together
like there are there are certain locks that you can only pick with two partners working on the same
task and so they will they will uh figure it out together that's bizarre and and what perception
gives them the ability what like how did they evolve to be able to do this to people speculate
i mean it's you know like intelligence is just the like basically none like none of us are smarter
than we have to be and none of us are are dumber than we need to be you know uh it's
a great quote that is a great quote i like that so like uh i mean there are there are statistical
deviations right like every once in a while um there's a fluke and like you know evolution will
cough out something that you know uh jack's our faudy yeah you get you get weird exceptions
but like on average it's i mean but that's because again like um you know evolution is itself a noisy
process whereby uh problems are solved and the problem is the the the propagation of
information through time and through space and so like you know uh evolution as a process loves
to maintain a diverse investment portfolio you know and so you get you get in in any population
you know you get a kind of reservoir of hedged bets you know so like um you know like in a
mature ecosystem you will have uh here's an episode of complexity i did on this back in
COVID where we were talking about mass extinctions being like a market crash
and um yeah i don't host this show anymore but it's still one of my favorite podcast episodes
i've ever why don't you host it anymore what happened oh i left SFI last year oh so this was
a podcast this was somebody else's podcast yeah this is a show i did for them but i talk about
this on the show on future fossils a lot also um this one let's see was this the 163
no it was 161 um where we talk about this like volatility market volatility
and uh create creativity and play and how uh you know like basically the noisier a market
is the more it rewards sort of generalist strategies we're like you know noisier investment
strategies because this the market is noisier you know and so like if you specialize you say like i'm
you know i'm gonna you know in a in a stable market you can kind of rely on you know a conservative
betting strategy but in an unstable market uh and that's that's what gets back to this you
know hunter s thompson saying when the going gets weird the weird turn pro you know because like
suddenly you've been you know like you've been the weirdo for your whole life when things were
normal and now they're not normal you know and so like there's that that classic trope in
in uh you know fiction where it's like aha the conspiracy theorist you know now civilization
is crumbled and like you're the only guy that spent you know 150 000 hours watching you know how do
you survive this kind of stuff and so suddenly everyone you know begrudgingly is like all right
let's it's time to listen to tinfoil hack guy right you know um but yeah it's it's uh it there are
time there are definitely times when it pays to be the uh the contrarian yes you know
that's amazing man so are you you're doing your art you do the podcast and then you're also a
musician are you a solo musician or do you have like a band the album i'm releasing right now is a
solo album but it's an album about all of this stuff it's like so you sing about it yeah yeah
it's it's an album about my ufo encounters and you know the the phenomenology of 5 m e o d m t
experience and what it's like to to erode the boundaries of selfhood through our immersion
and digital technologies and you know why we should be careful what we wish for when we start
connecting our dreaming brains to 3d printers because then you're going to just print out
whatever you're dreaming about and like is that really a great idea to you know smash the boundary
between your dream life and physical reality um yeah it's it's an album called the age of reunion
and i play like 20 instruments and really i recorded it all at home so it's it's it's a
sort of of uneven production quality but it's coming out every a new track every week until
the end of april it's fun i've been working on it for 22 years it was time to get it out
really yeah are you still producing it like every day as we speak or is this stuff that's
you've already done a long time ago you're just really you're just dripping it out now yeah i'm
on the new stuff i've been you know all of this stuff was stuff that's like it's it's fun to research
this stuff uh academically but then it's also fun to inquire through a creative practice and like
for me you know electroacoustic music and in particular taking an acoustic guitar and routing
it through a bunch of effects pedals and sampling yourself and remixing yourself is kind of like
like a like a a garage laboratory for studying cybernetics and evolutionary
you know kind of processes and like let's hear it what's it called um let's let's Steve pull
up that way yeah yeah he can pipe it through the there's there's a look up transparent
uh on the age of reunion on youtube it's this this one right here let me see this is the
latest single where is it this one
it's on my link tree you got music videos oh yeah i did them all with ai they're fun
wow did you see khanye's new ai music video no holy shit is it amazing is it full of swastikas
no it's not full of swastikas thank god oh well you got it pulled out i mean yeah but we can't
hear it through the mixer you can't you can't hear it on my hand you can't find it Steve
Steve's not as good as a googler as you are i i'm not showing it to you there we go i think
i found it yeah yeah yeah this is the one yeah so this is a song oh whoa you you send it go up
so if you buy it you get this no okay i'm gonna i am gonna i am gonna print this album to vinyl
at some point um but i haven't done it yet because it costs a lot of money
yeah i bet but yeah this is play it this is uh where's it right there right here here we go
yeah you should uh max that full screen i love how you did it vertically for an iphone right
right i mean it's an album about life online so so what whoa what ai software did you use to make
this oh this is a kyber kyber k ai yeah and it's a video one mm-hmm yeah import your music and your
lyrics and your prompts oh shit so this is like yeah this is a video based on my the actual sound
and lyrical content did you ask it to go vertical and not widescreen
wow this is a beautiful great
oh
so i imagine when you imported your voice into this in the beginning it did sound it didn't
sound exactly like this they just like just ordered it somehow i mean this is like i don't
know six-part harmony or something
i was going for like an hr giga meets lisa frank kind of vibe you know yeah like scary but pretty
because that's the nature of what we're living through right now scary but pretty
oh
dude that's fucking crazy i had no idea that i didn't know about that um
ai software that can do this kind of stuff oh there's tons of it now
i got a lot of friends dabbling in this space what's the name of it again kyber this one is
kyber yeah i mean you can do this with stable diffusion you can do this with
i mean you know adobe is working on consumer grade stuff for this
i actually track state-of-the-art ai stuff now as part of my consulting
it's moving very fast
oh
Scared if we weren't sharing it, Scared if we weren't sharing it, Scared
Yeah, it's like beautiful and terrifying at the same time.
I mean, that's the human condition.
That was incredible.
Thanks, man.
So all of your music videos, you use AI to make them?
Just recently. I've got a ton of live stuff up on the YouTubers as well.
Yeah, I mean, I like playing with whatever tools are available, you know, like if you're going to be the weirdo on the edge of the village, there's like a kind of responsibility to do this stuff to see what's possible to report back, you know.
So it's just part of that whole sort of overarching gesture of, you know, going to Australia and drawing the platypus.
Yeah.
Have you ever heard of author and punisher?
Mm-mm.
He does some really cool stuff.
Steve, pull up author and punisher on YouTube.
He doesn't use AI, but he's been doing this for a few years now where he takes like, he has like a warehouse where he has these like industrial machines and he synthesizes them into this like crazy electronic mix down.
It sounds like a, it's like, it sounds like like metal industrial, like Apex twin.
It's insane.
You find it, Steve?
Yeah, watch this.
And his fucking videos are wild.
Well, SquarePisher did some stuff like that with like a robot orchestra.
Oh, yeah.
Wow.
Yeah.
I mean, this is, this is what we're talking about in terms of like, you know, technology being a recombinant space where more and more of us are going to be making our own instruments, you know, inventing our own tools to suit whatever kind of creative language we feel, you know, like one of my favorite artists is, is Onyx Ashanti.
Who invented a full body suit that's like his cybernetic music interface.
Whoa.
And then-
On YouTube?
Yeah, he's got a bunch of older stuff.
And then also my friend Shigal in the Netherlands, she uses motion capture suits and stuff like this to do, like full body music control.
And so that's, you know, that seems like a pretty natural extension of, you know, creative activity as a kind of like operatic, you know, like a new syntax of interactions between the body and its built environment.
Yeah.
Without shit.
Yeah, that's what I, yeah, there's Onyx.
Yeah, totally.
So he's, he's like covered in this, this 3D printed mech suit that he wears.
And I don't know how recent of a video you're going to find of his stuff, but he's very interested in, in this notion of like the evolution of language and, you know, like coming up with gestural interfaces that this is very much like a straight out of a DMT thing.
Like when you see people in, you know, in a DMT induced state that are spontaneously gesturing and, you know, they're engaged in like glossolalia, you know, speaking in tongues type stuff.
You know, he's basically just coming up with like the cybernetic extension to turn that kind of induced improvised full body gesture.
Into something that's got like a machine translation layer in it so that other people can kind of groove on his groove.
You know, my, my friend, the T fairy, who is also on the no enotics advisory board talks about, about this being, you know, she and I have had a lot of conversations about this being the, you know, the kind of the future of human language is.
It's something where, you know, we are, we're communicating through a kind of cybernetic translation envelope to one another, but everybody's got a different layer.
Like the way that, you know, the way that we're going to, we're starting to use augmented reality glasses for real time translation.
And so we're going to have, you know, before long, you know, why would even, why would we even have languages in the way that we think of them?
Right. You know, like you would have your own language and the machine would just translate it into, you know, something that somebody else can understand.
Like universal language.
Yeah. Well, like the, the, the translation layer is universal, but your language is yours. It's like speaker base of one, you know, that's something that Peter Watts has written about in some of his sci-fi and blind sight and necopraxia.
Or what about just like telepathic communication? Like when will we be able to, like if we were able to stop using our vocal cords to talk and speak out sentences, like just thinking about things or communicating image with imagery through people or like intention?
I mean, it's funny. Let's, let's not get too far ahead of it because like, like I already saw that joke of like in order to improve typing while using the Apple vision pro.
We've created a fake iPhone keyboard that you see in, in AR that you can still sit there using your thumbs, like you're actually holding a phone.
And it's like, you know, there, there are questions, right? Like there's, what is it? Chesterton's fence, this, this principle of like, don't pull up the fence until you know why the fence is there.
You know, like there are certain things that like, it's actually probably a bad idea for us to get to the point where we're so reliant on technology that we, none of us speak the same language.
Because as soon as that technology fails, you can't talk to each other.
Right.
You know, and so what persists into the new possibility spaces that we're creating, you know, what, what is actually strongly conserved in a new evolutionary regime is a really interesting question.
For instance, you know, we thought that we were going to be able to do away with the civil society, you know, mutual aid networks, family groups, tribal affiliations, you know, professional guilds.
That somehow the state and the market and the economies of scale there in the greater efficiency of organization at scale through states and markets was going to replace our need to like raise your kids in a village.
And that has sure not true, you know, proven to be true, you know, like raising your kids in a nuclear family in the suburb is terrible.
You know, like you want an extended family around.
Right.
You know, and so the question is like, well, what do we think that we're getting ready to give up now?
And that's why, you know, like when I was on the, you know, I was, I have conversations with Carl Hayden Smith, who's a, you know, brilliant psychedelic philosopher who's also involved in nonotics.
And Carl and I were talking about how, like, you know, with all due respect to Andrew Gallimore, like, you know, Andrew has this very sort of unrepentantly transhuman vision of our future.
And Carl and I are more on the side of like hyperhuman.
It's like, how do we, it's not how we replace the human with technology.
It's how do we add something without losing something really crucial in the process.
Right.
You know, but that's an open question.
Well, thank you, Michael, for doing this, man.
I really appreciate it.
Likewise, I love your show.
I love listening.
So thanks for having me on.
I appreciate that.
Tell people where they can follow your podcast, listen to your music, find your art, all that stuff.
Yeah.
I mean, the mother tree is just the link tree right now, link tree, Michael Garfield.
But yeah, the, you know, Patreon, Substack are both feeds that the podcast is there, but so is a bunch of other stuff, art and music and writing.
And I'm working on two books and I'm helping no analytics figure out how to raise money for their, their research facility.
And I'm working on some AI and tech ethics stuff I'll be sharing soon.
And yeah, I'd love to, I would love to hear from you if you find this interesting.
This is a direct invitation to reach out to me.
So yeah.
Cool, man.
Thanks again for your time and for blowing my mind.
Absolutely.
Good night, everybody.
Bye.
