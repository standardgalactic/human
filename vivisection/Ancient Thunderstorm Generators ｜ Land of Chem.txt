These hills were used to generate thunderstorms.
So we went to England and this is how the White Horse Hills of Wiltshire, England work.
So you can see the face of this hill in an angle, the same angle as the slope of the face of the
Great Pyramid, which is the ideal vector for sweeping a hot air front and a cold air front
into the atmosphere that generates cumulonimbus clouds. There was an obelisk or standing stone
at the top of the structure, capturing naturally occurring lightning, causing dielectric polarization
of the white chalk that creates more thunderstorm clouds and more lightning
using these naturally occurring electric currents in a cycle.
