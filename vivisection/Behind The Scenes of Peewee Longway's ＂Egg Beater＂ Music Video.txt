We got to keep this smoking outside.
Let's keep it to only in the video.
Yeah, it'll just be here.
Yeah, but like if it's not being filmed, we got to do it outside.
Man.
Or at least we can do it in there in the garage.
But not in there.
Delicious.
Huh?
Hi.
We are here at Pee Wee Longway's rap video shoot.
We've got some Kena Flow lighting we've set up here.
We've got all sorts of great stuff happening.
We've got models, actors.
Just a great time.
Call your house, you need five fingers, eight fingers.
Clean up the room with some dry fingers, eight fingers.
Check them in the back for the money.
How many are we able to get up there?
Let's do this, then.
Right here.
Okay.
Okay, cool.
All right.
Eleven or?
Cool.
Almost ready.
Hi, come on up.
Hi, come on up.
One, two, three, four.
All right.
