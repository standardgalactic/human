All the CKY videos and all that stuff haggard all that stuff pretty much like defined our
childhoods like that's a very depressing thing to hear I'm just kidding man I'm kidding
it is the it is the the reason I ever picked up a video camera like ever when I was 15
and started doing that's led to all this shit and like it is so cool to sit down and talk
to you man it's it's unreal it's no I'm grateful to be here this is you guys have a really
rad thing going on and you know I look forward to making any reason to make it to Florida
I really like it I have a place in Fort Lauderdale oh do you really yeah and I was telling you
know telling him time kind of slows down when you get here whenever I get off the plane
as soon as I walk off the plane and the air hits me I'm like I can breathe so it's you
know I really love coming here but it's funny because the the gravity and the magnitude
of what that's produced from then to now is like mind-blowing and the amount of money
that's generated off of like YouTube is insane oh dude so crazy you know I remember being
at Bam's house when he received his first check for the million dollars I actually signed
for it really when they delivered the package and the funny thing is the irony is I had no
idea what I had signed for I was like withdrawing on heroin from heroin because that's how I
ended up at his house and in those CKY videos and the part that I played in the very first
one or the second whatever one that was in second or third I think was a third was Dooley
which was a drug dealer and I was a shady drug dealer guy which was ironically my drug dealers
name in Baltimore what's up sweetheart guy yeah yeah yeah yeah but you know at that point
in time there was no like internet sensation there was no YouTube and you know it was word
of mouth and you know it was just kind of sold out of skate shops yeah tapes yeah how did
that shit start to like catch fire like I knew like you guys obviously were well known
like in the skateboarding circuit but like how like it's hard to even fathom when you're
making videos back then how you would get the word out or get people to start like sharing
them like these kids and like everybody all my friends would buy every single CKY we would
download we would watch it all the time like how do people in Florida become so like obsessed
with their stuff and find this stuff when it's coming out of like Pennsylvania for sure it's
there's no internet I mean there is internet but not really not then yeah it wasn't being used
like it is today I think you know bam was just really way ahead of his time yeah he said such
a creative perspective on life and because the majority of the people in the CKY videos
weren't really skaters you know there was a handful like but the ones out of Pennsylvania
didn't skate done didn't skate rab didn't skate deco didn't skate rake didn't skate bam skated
and maldonado skated and then bam kind of just showcased his other skater friends
because he realized I remember him saying he's like dude you know skating's rad but
no one gives a like the varsity you know girl who's like gonna go on to become Miss America
doesn't care about skating like how do we make this cross paths and he did that by just kind of
adding these funny stupid skits that you know was just really in at the time and it kind of
transitioned into a bigger world than just skaters you know it wasn't limited to just that and
then it just kind of spread didn't you get him into skating we know I didn't get him into skating
but I'm from Baltimore and Bucky Lasik who's you know another pro skateboarder yeah legend
totally um he's from Baltimore as well and and uh he was older than I and and he kind of recognized
I guess the talent that I had at the young age and he took me under his wing and he was the one
that got me sponsored by pal and and that's how my career into that world began but before I like
really kind of started forging my own future in it we would go to the skate park called cheap
skates in Pennsylvania and uh I walked in and I saw bam and I'm like this kid's gonna be a problem
hey everybody I just want to drop in to remind you all to please hammer the subscribe button below
the video that is the one thing that makes this channel and these podcasts grow and enables us to
keep making more of them flying in guests all over the world etc etc um thank you to everybody who
has been subscribing it has been helping a lot the reach has been growing we're now up to like
60 of the viewers of these podcasts are subscribed they're still like 40 45 who are not yet subscribed
so if you're a regular watcher of the channel and you enjoy these podcasts and you want to help
all I ask is that you just hammer that subscribe button below these videos thank you again I love
you all back to the show for me because we were just alike we skated alike we dressed alike we
act alike we talked alike we we we were into the same kind of setup skating transitions you know
contest skater consistency tricks and um and we became thickest thieves best friends at that point
and uh he wasn't sponsored at the time but I was already by pal and bucky was pro so he had asked
us to try to help him get sponsored and it didn't work out with pal at the time but nonetheless
every year we'd enter this skate contest called the the the uh brick town scape uh the NSA is the
brick town skate park contest and either he would win or I would win and one year he was there bucky
had went and bam was like yo where's Novak and bucky's like I think he's on heroin and bam's
like what's that you know at such a young age and even know what the word meant and that's kind of
where his career continued to excel he became a household name with the cky videos that then
turned into um you know viva la bam's later on um and he pursued that route in life and I
I thought it was a much more logical approach to pursue heroin
yeah how did you first discover heroin at such a young age what were you like 16 or 17 at the end
of uh 16 turning 17 I was like a uh a fully addicted heroin addict and it's early yeah the
progression took place way way way quicker than I ever anticipated it to do so um and at the time
I had no idea what was happening now it's very evident and clear as day for me to kind of look back
and recognize the synchronicity in life's events that took place that landed me there then and here
now right um and a I was genetically predisposed right my father was an addict his father was an
addict my mother my brother and sister by a different gentleman have no issues I on the other hand
followed in the footsteps of my father and his father that paired with uh I was kind of being
groomed without me even knowing I was being groomed in that culture of promiscuous behaviors
addiction um drug dealing uh drug using you know I remember being a you know a six seven-year-old
kid my father he never worked a day in his life um he taught me one thing if and when I went to
prison how to conduct myself and he ran with the hell's angels he was a pretty gnarly kind of guy
and he was around just enough to let us know he was not around and um you know I remember as a kid
my mother right she had just got a job at mercy hospital like drawing blood for five dollars a
pop a phlebotomist and then she literally worked her way up the ladder to become a nuclear physicist
on the board of mercy hospital pretty big deal and um so in doing that and pursuing that career
like she was consumed by climbing that ladder uh and and my father unfortunately was the one that
kind of took care of me not a lot but when he was around and he would take me to the strip joint
and and he'd be in the back conducting business and the pretty dancing girls would put me on a
stool at the bar and and pour me shots of ginger ale and coca-cola and I would you know what I mean
so I was I was just kind of like being raised in that world which was I rather ironic because
one would think that like I'd recognize that this is not a a healthy path to pursue right you
would think that but the reality is as a matter of fact I made it a point to excel at everything
I did in my life to not become my father all right because Jerome was a great guy my father
everyone loved Jerome but when he didn't show up at 530 to make dinner for us um and we heard him
and his biker buddies pulling at three or 330 and the keys hit the lock we shook like leaves
because we knew what we were in for and it was nothing that a child should ever have to endure
so you would think logically that I'd be like whoa drugs are bad kid stay the f*** away
but I think paired with the genetical predisposition and um being cultivated within that society
normalized it early yeah that this connection from reality had already started taking place
paired with the fact that I was already a really successful skateboarder at such a young age
so from others perspectives from the outside looking in it looked like there was a method to
my madness right at 14 I'm being endorsed by Gatorade at 15 I'm touring the world with Tony
Hawk you know I'm ending up in thrash or in trans world I have video parts in the pow videos like
I'm I'm doing some pretty rad shit yeah so like people are like ah he's cool he's got it like he
wouldn't and then I think when people started to take notice I was so like disconnected from reality
and or abnormality that it was like how and uh yeah that was so like what year was that roughly
when you started taking off at skateboarding to do to put into perspective how my timeline of brain
works is like we my second book had come out a year or two ago the sequel to dream seller and uh
my life for the better part of 18 years just looked like spring break on methamphetamine
right like I was just 24 seven so we went and hired this private investigator and we said hey I need
to know I need you to dig up every arrest record every confrontation with every police officer
every jail stay every incarceration bit and and he's looks at me he's like what why most people
try to bury this really deep you're asking me to unearth all remember it yeah because like when I
would see things like that I could put in my mind where I was at at that time right like uh my brain
compared to your brain two different brains here we go example a where were you at well okay here's
where I was at uh yeah New Year's Eve 1999 right do you remember where you were at New Year's Eve
1999 oh no 99 yeah it was Y2K yeah I was at my grandparents in Pennsylvania okay wait waiting
for that ball that was Y2K drop right yeah yeah I'd have no recollection okay cool so you're
you're about halfway there with me so I know exactly where I was at I was at that point in time
running a room on the corner of Broadway in Eager in East Baltimore in an abandoned house from this
crackhead named Slim who kind of took over the house and we'd pay him 10 bucks a night
I'm shitting and I'm pissing into a bucket and it's freezing out and Y2K is about to hit so me
and the two people I'm sharing that room with uh Caleb and Alexia we each get uh pillow cases
and we have a crowbar and we're standing outside of the right aid in East Baltimore because at
12 o'clock when the power goes out we're gonna rob it and hit the pharmacy of all these and it's
gonna be like I've hit the mega millions it didn't happen I went to rehab the very following morning
that's how my brain so you ask me to timelines like fuck I was just trying to like put it in my
own perspective of like because I remember when I was we were getting like I was like obsessed with
all this stuff like my life was skateboarding and watching skate videos and it was like I remember
the first I think it was the first skate video I ever saw was the Baker 2G video yeah and then
after that it was the flip sorry videos and all those videos and the piss drunks dude
and these guys were just hammered smashed dude I remember one time the piss drunk guys all my
they're all good people and the majority of them are sober today yeah they're almost all sober
dude Bluala had a pretty tragic story yeah he just came out of a pretty rad documentary I have
not seen I've seen pieces of it I mean you see yeah yeah I love Ali he's a great guy it's pretty
cool sad story but super cool but they came through it my very first tattoo of all my tattoos
and I'm pretty covered is this one right here and it says no more fucking heroin uh-huh and it
what I didn't get it like it was I got it but it wasn't by my design it was when bam brought me
it was in the video wasn't it yeah I think we talked about it and I I couldn't stop getting high and
and he was doing the best that he had with what he could do and and he's like the next time you
get hot we're gonna get you a tattoo and it's gonna say no more fucking heroin the next time
you want to get high I want you to look at this tattoo and it's gonna stop you yeah of course that's
gonna work yeah you fast forward I didn't get sober till 2015 so you do the math I know that
timeline it's fucked oh my god but um that was my very first tattoo and the piss drunk guys came
shortly thereafter and Andrew and Ali they were like dude Radis tattoo ever you're coming on tour
with us bam's like no he's not yeah dude that was so great in the culture too it was just like
for me being I was like probably 16 years old watching these guys just get hammered and
fucking jumped down 20 stairs was like inconceivable to me and then there was that kid Nox Godoy he was
like 15 super young he was like drinking 40s and like like where's he at today I have no idea I
saw some I'm still skating I think but it's crazy to see him grow and I remember him from the
vaker 2g video like screaming at the camera like cussing at the camera and then just like the camera
he's like tall yeah but he jumps down like a 12 stair or something I love watching the transition
because I always wondered like how's Andrew gonna carry it like he was the piss drunk guy and that
was some of the rat for me my favorite style of skating and still always will be him getting
sober like and and still that being like the pinnacle of everything for the baker at the point
in time it how's that going to transition and he did it so beautifully like he wasn't like uh sober
this isn't the way to go he just let like the newer younger crew kind of forge just like a game
still show for it straight up and if that's your deal that's your deal yeah and that's what skateboarding
is it's individuality individuality with like kind of a I actually really you know give all credit
to who I am today the life that I live as a direct result of skateboarding right like skateboarding
with my sobriety with my work ethics with what I've been blessed to create and it's you know
failure is not an option and no is unacceptable and think about it a skater will try a trick for
days weeks months years yeah same trick over and over and over and that's literally
how I've got to where I'm at today dude and how old are you now 44 I just don't you're still ripped
dude I was looking at your Instagram you check this out I just I'm putting this I'm gonna post this
in a couple days but I'm gonna give you a sneak peek I'm so stoked on this trick dude check this bad
way out it's like it's worth it
oh shit that dude that I fought with that thing for a minute
where's it where's that at my buddy's mini ramp in Baltimore 410
skate company that was sick man and it's just a sick ramp we'll just switch 50 no it's uh it's just
it's just a frontside 180 like fakey nose grind and then bring it in forward very like
Bob Bernquist kind of deal yeah hell yeah I love that man love the mini ramp but dude skateboarding
is like I just realized you would have thought that I came to this realization years ago when I
did it like full time for a living that but I didn't I didn't realize it until I just put a part out
not too long ago and you know I'm 44 my my brain says that I'm like 16 my body says I'm like 99
and I'm trying this trick and I'm trying and I'm trying and I can't make it and I'm like
so angry I think I sprained my ankle I'm like throwing my board and and I walk away and I don't
get it but it dawned on me like this is why I love it while trying that trick being filled with
just frustration and and negativity because I couldn't land it it did exactly what it was supposed
to do it shut this off I wasn't thinking about work I wasn't thinking about her him it's like
I was in the moment yeah like in it in it in it in it and I've fucking that's the best spent a lot
of money went a lot of places and and just hung out with a lot of women trying to fulfill that void
and skateboarding and I did I realized that at 43 like so like think about it so like everyone
tries I think I mean I really try to be in the moment and it's fucking difficult no doubt yeah
man that's therapeutic yeah to do that and you can see I mean even with bam you can see on his
Instagram now that he seems like he's skating more and I don't know anything about you know him
or what he's doing but it seems like he's got like his head his shit together more that he's
actually like trying stuff now and like skating and landing shit and posting on his Instagram
and he's yeah it's more than like positive reinforcement it is I'd say it's so good for
the mental health it is um and that's how I can tell when anyone in the skateboarding world
is doing good or bad you know whether they're actually skating not just like you know shoot
a photo of me posing this trick you can see that but like and that's really with it comes back to
everything um it's the behaviors right alcoholism addiction shopping gambling food porn sex that's
that's the solution to the underlining causing condition the real root of the problem the
behaviors lead to those endings or solutions or narratives if you will so you know I can tell
by someone's behavior change or lack thereof where they're really at so understanding that I really
don't need to hear much about what what you have to say honestly yeah as long as I just sit back and
kind of and as a direct result of this spiritual experience that I have had I'm just like insanely
hypersensitive I'm aware I'm alert and attentive of my surroundings too much so like hypersensitive
fuck is it hard for you to get through life being sober and not do I mean you've said it a million
times that you just love drugs and alcohol yeah is it hard for you to stay away from it do you
think about it or is it kind of like no you've sort of like hit a switch and now it doesn't really
bother you uh dude I I've had this like profound experience uh of this spiritual experience and
the definition of a spiritual experience is simply a psychic change meaning that I brand
to know back today no longer look at things how I did then during the CKY's the Viva La Bams the
jackasses um and and what that looks like for me is that without trying to get all like fucking
zen on everything here my my poison has become my medicine right and I am like completely free
from the change of bondage of addiction and alcoholism I poison being sobriety just being like
yes but in a way of like it's so consumed to me that not only does it like save my life on a daily
basis it allows me um the ability to get through to so many others yeah where generally they we
build this really high deep thick unpenetratable wall because the demographic or wheelhouse for which
I'm most or widely known as simple addicts and alcoholics and what are we defined by nature hate
authority refuse to conform right because we possess this job that consists of knowing everything
so when you suggest what I should do to potentially save my life I suggest why you should fuck off
because I know and because of my story being so widely viewed read you know publicized in the
public format there's depth and weight you know there's experience hard one experience that's
earned me a position of of understanding as opposed to being understood so when I have the ability
to work with somebody they know that like I get it like I understand it I'm great at playing
devil's advocate and the beautiful thing about it is my life is just as maybe if not more consumed
by drugs and alcohol today but the only difference is I don't use them and it provides me an amazing
beautiful blessed life yeah it makes no sense anywhere else in the world yeah and it's nothing
shy of a miracle and magical that only makes sense within the sober community of what at one
point in time I looked at is like this fucking cult like I wasn't buying what you're selling I'm not
drinking your Kool-Aid and I'm fucking like dude I love life and I don't want to live mine sitting
in some weird church basement with these weird old people yeah and I'm like dude then I you know for
me the pain had just become so great a whole lot of things aligned to where I was willing to do the
unthinkable which was like maybe conceived to my innermost personal self that like you know what I do
know is that I don't fucking know because prior to that date my resume stated that I did know some
shit because I had done some things so is this such a mind fuck yeah man you know how do I go
from like being a pretty successful guy by an outsider's perspective to the reality of understanding
that the very best of my thinking places me in a position where I'm walking into my 13th inpatient
treatment center and I'm standing in the basement with this weird 19 year old boy as he's thumbing
through a donations box looking me for some used underwear and I'm praying to God that he finds him
how the fuck did I get here one and one was not equal in two boys but but what I didn't realize then
because I was so consumed by the mess that I was incapable of seeing the message that that day that
I thought was the worst day of my life true story has literally turned out to be the best day of my
life like that that day and I've had some really rad days in my life I've done some of the most
amazing things even under the influence that I would never take back but that day legit standing
in my 13th rehab a Catholic Charities facility that cost me two dollars to get into I walked in
with the clothes on my back literally tied on by a shoestring everything I owned
and consisted of eight scarfs two jackets three socks a stick of deodorant it fit into this bag
that doubled as my pillow a needle a spoon in a restraining order that's all that I owned legit
and a passport oddly enough and I'm in the basement with this 19 year old kid and he's thumbing
through these donation boxes looking for some used underwear for me and I'm I'm like praying to God
praying to God that he finds him and he does not find them but what he does find is a
parasites 40 women's sweatpants with no drawstring a woman's tank top and a parasites 13 Jesus
sandals right that's a hell of a fit right there bro that's like Florida's finest man no disrespect
which is why I love Florida right now you just get in when you fit in here but it's just some big
I like God bless Florida man but at the time I was like dude like I go from like skateboarder
jackass Viva LaBam you know a New York Times author like who's done some shit man yeah and
I'm in this basement with this weird boy fucking handed me women's clothes and like how I didn't
and my father was like you know what I mean like I should have known
look I didn't end up in in addiction it's funny I didn't end up in addiction because I took the
short bus to school right quite the contrary I ended up in addiction because I was too smart for
my own goddamn good and every time I'd land in in a in a psychiatrist's office a doctor's office a
treatment center a 12-step program in a seat that had the ability to save my life I would out
think myself right out of it I'd seen me do it so many times and it's funny because quite the
contrary and I just just dawned on me I didn't end up in recovery until I took the short bus to
that meeting I literally had to dumb my way into sobriety straight up you know you had a really
unique like your perspective had to have been so much different than everyone else like you were
kind of unique in a sense because you it was almost like during cky and jackass and bevel of
bam and all that stuff you had one foot in this crazy fucking world with bam and like the spotlight
being on national tv for sure you had another foot in this fucking just hell dude I'm glad that you
pointed that out and it's really ironic because shameless plug here but the book that I was just
telling you about that I did the audio the audio version for the narration for the audio version
the streets of baltimore it really chronicles that whole thought process of knowing that like
that was a you know because no matter how amazing and beautiful the experience was and how much I
loved it and wanted to take advantage of it I knew I knew that it was only a matter of time before
I burnt it to the ground as a direct result of my addiction because like I was unable to control
you know it when I am drinking and drugging I lose the pleasure of having a say so in any
matter anymore and I didn't understand it then but right my book is all I mean my life is all in
retrospect live forward and learn backwards right so now when I had written that book after I had
made it through that I could like really see the reality of my situation and truth be told the
reason why I ended up in those positions for so long is because I refused I refused to give
addiction or alcoholism and or recovery the time attention or respect that it deserved
right because I knew you know what I mean like come on like I wanted what you had but I wasn't
really do it willing to do what you suggested in order to obtain this this new life that you have
there has to be a quicker easier way for me to get there right right it's gonna be an easier way
than this yeah right I was just too smart for my own good I swear to God I always say my life for
fucking like 18 years was basically me rearranging the furniture on the Titanic that that that that
could just be this whole podcast you knew it was going down but I always with the best intentions
like if I just put this here and you come here and she goes there it'll be like it's gonna be
different oh my god and I believed it I really believed it and then I'd wake up tomorrow write the
behaviors I'd wake up tomorrow and repeat yesterday's actions and I'm stuck in Groundhog's Day for
like another 10 years whoa like that was legit it what the fuck is that out I can't get over that
Alf tattoo it keeps drawing me to it dude so do you know the story behind that do you know
there is a story behind it I'm sure there is the creator of Alf we're used to your fan of Al you
remember yeah I remember um the creator of Alf Michael I think his name Michael something
we look it up um there's a book written about it called Permanent Midnight which they then made
a movie about it and Ben Stiller plays him but he was a strung out heroin and crack addict
wow developing the treatment plan of Alf which makes sense if you think about it this weird
watch the movie or read the book it's one of the most amazing things ever read and Ben Stiller
plays it and plays a great drug addict he played oh wow dude I had no fucking clue that explains a
lot he was like an alien from Malomac and he lived all day that's when he stood for alien life form
that's what Alf stood for and all he did was just like try to eat the cat the family he was such a
weird show that was when I was really young if you watch the read the book or watch the document
the movie it makes complete sense oh my god so I ended up that's not why I got this though
I wish that was a good story it is aligned but I was at this tattoo convention and they're like
yo we'll pay you to get a tattoo I was a judge or something like okay and I think Baby Bam came
up with the idea for Alf and I'm like all right so I get the tattoo and then these chicks come up
like we have some blow you want to come and like yes we go out the parking lot and the security
follows people are following I'm in the car doing this blow and because I breached my contract they
never paid me for the convention or the tattoo that I was supposed to get you breached your contract
for doing blow for leaving both are leaving and like avoiding my responsibilities of being a judge
because chicks had cocaine and that was way more important come on guys yeah I can't blame yourself
for that yeah sorry to interrupt but this episode of the podcast is brought to you by Verso we all
know how important it is to get the right amount of nutrition exercise and sleep as we age it's
something I'm really passionate about and have discussed at length with doctors and nutritional
scientists on this podcast that is why I use Verso Verso is a company dedicated into translating
scientific breakthroughs into products that hold the potential to increase longevity I take cell
being every day to help combat aging by increasing my nad levels with powerful ingredients such as
nmn transverse varitrol and tmg nad plus is arguably one of the most powerful molecules in the body
but declines with age keeping nad plus levels high helps guide longevity genes called sirtuins
sirtuins are called longevity genes because by activating them they support overall health
and slow down aging related effects by regulating important processes inside of cells
high nad plus levels can improve your metabolism repair damage dna and ramp up energy production
in your brain immune system and muscles now you can't take nad plus as a supplement because it's
too big for the cells to absorb but nmn directly converts to nad plus while resveratrol activates
your sirtuins which increases their attraction for nad these two molecules act synergistically and
increase your nad plus more than just nmn on its own verso also publishes third-party testing
from each batch produced to absolutely guarantee you're getting what you pay for head on over to
ver.so and use the coupon code danny it's spelled d a n n y to save 15 off your entire order or just
go to ver.so forward slash danny back to the show what was it like during like the heyday of
obviously the cky videos were the first but that didn't really like that that kind of kicked off
seek or viva la bam right yeah yeah if you like what was it like in the heyday of filming that
and like i know i heard i heard his interview on that guy cow head the other day and he was
talking about like all the money they had and just like every week they had an insane budget
and like flying all over the world and just coming up with the craziest shit ever it sounded like it
was too good to be true yeah it was really um it was intimidating for me very overwhelming because
the very first like 300 grand a week or something i think yeah mtv's budget was just
stupid it was stupid but the very first episode that i appeared in was um
where they demolished don vedo's house and they like threw trash through the the window
like really demolished it and i had just gotten off a bus from baltimore and at this point i'm like
clean but by force not by choice and i've burnt all my options there and i'm living in this like
halfway house i'm like the only white kid in this halfway house and it's in the hood
and i was really just so confused about me and who i was like i had no idea or self confidence
it's gotta be a weird situation to be in and then i'm thrusted to there i show up it's this whole set
there's the cast there it's just shit everywhere money money filming and all these professionals
and bams like the man and i remember him as being this like little skate rat and and i wanted to be
a part of it and i knew done from then i knew rab i knew all those guys but not in this light and
they like wanted me to be a part of it but i was just like such an out i was at that point
time i was just such a stranger in my own skin trying to figure out who the fuck let me in and
why and all i wanted was a release which was like to get high and and that wasn't allowed so it's
just this struggle yeah um and and then the the producers they didn't really want me in it because
i just was like this odd like person that didn't really fit their storylines but bam kept insisting
that i'd be in it and again we talk about all this in the streets of baltimore we're really
getting to think of it but um he'd like write me in scenes and then they'd cut me out when it made
the editing and just wouldn't and and that makes me even more depressed and like just this this
weird little redheaded stepchild that no one was accepting on their end like bam and rab and rake
and done and all those they love me but um and then finally i'll never forget it the one day broke
where like i i said something and it was like comical gold and they all started it started
laughing and in the cast the crew and like it was like the best day of my life and i and right there
and then so that paired with the fact that i was bam's best friend and and i could do no wrong right
and now at this point i was allowed to drink and and do blow but i couldn't do like any downers
because then like that's not cool i'd steal your wallet uppers are good yeah that's so so acceptable
and like life for the party when i'm doing downers i'm gonna steal your shit i'm gonna lie i'm gonna
disappear to baltimore for like weeks i'll possibly die in your living room it's kind of frowned
upon yeah a little bit but um and throughout this time i'm starting to kind of feel who i am a little
bit more direction i'd spent more time there and um i'm kind of just finding my way and but i'm
just becoming such a major pain in the ass to the production team because like bam would want me to
do funny shit they couldn't control me because i wasn't on payroll i'm bam's best friend he's never
i'm like fuck you like i'll walk out like naked with a heart on jerking off if that's like i did
that for one see any of those guys but bam just brought you along so i had to deal with yes so
but it's funny i i say this one line and it was during one of the episodes and we do this thing
and it's called like maniac pool and it's me done rad ray rake might be in there dico and we're just
like it's a mosh pit but playing pool and they're all getting ready to fly to europe and they asked me
if i had gone i'm like i can't i have warrants and and everyone just starts dying but it was
really the truth at the time yeah so the producer lady i'm gonna say her name she pulls me aside
after and she's like look no back it's inevitable that like you're now gonna become a character on
this show but we can't control you so we're gonna pay you and now that we pay you you have to listen
to us and i'm like deal yeah perfect but again most people be like wow that's a really smart
strategy to end up on the payroll make a living out of this no i just dumbed my way into that
which is anything good in my life really today it's just like not done you know by my doings
where were you guys when uh there's a story of where bam was like you're like i need some money
and bam's like go shove a rock up your ass and i'll pay you yeah that was in europe that was in
europe that was in europe that was that was that you know that paired with many other things that i
had shoved up my my anus for a lot of years while traveling to to you know get under the radar of
police not detecting what i was trying to consume which were narcotics um ultimately led to me having
like this hemorrhoid surgery because like what i just blew my anus out i say a lot of things and
even saying that i'm like dude this just it's just rolling off the tongue wrong it's not what
you're trying for i don't think there's a more self-deprecating thing you can say about yourself
well it's it's it's one of those magical things name to me another male who's not a homosexual
who's had his anus blown out right not many fit that who brags about it on podcast
it could be one-on-one it's all perspective it could be worse yeah well i mean you got the
most use out of it i did um and but again these are right and the reason why because this this
generally wouldn't be stuff that i'd want to like really like focus on because i i'm a very
changed a different man today but all perspective these are the things that i personally enjoy
talking about because it gives depth and weight to the story that the the transformation that's
taking place as a direct result of me kind of you know reaching out and asking for help which
is what i'm all about today is helping people who are where i once was so you know those defects
have become my assets right that poison has become my medicine that i can now share with countless
others um so it's giving me purpose it's giving me drive it's giving me meaning it's it's giving me
love right it's taught me compassion empathy sympathy um and it all spawned from skateboarding
really did so you guys were in europe when that happened and then didn't you have to go to the
hospital after that i did i went to the hospital because you guys were on oh you oh that was when
he had the band right uh-huh face unstoppable yeah which i was i was the most important person in
the band but i didn't even play any musical instruments i wasn't even in the band again
being his best friend traveling his kind of form of entertainment he used to say i was like his
walking television they couldn't really like kick me off the tour yeah until yeah and then they put
me on the tour like opening for them is pill collins there's a whole other thing so then i had some
relevance to the tour at that point but we have all that footage so again all of that footage
we have and you know i have a documentary that will be coming out that unbeknownst to me or us
has been in production since the cky days so that's like 20 some years we have the actual real-time
footage so everything that i'm talking about for the majority of this episode we have the actual
footage too oh wow and um so cool we you know i'm i we are putting it out so we have complete
creative control um it's in production editing now joe france who filmed the cky's yeah he's
doing this project is he really yeah wow yeah so when we're done like then we'll look at how we're
going to uh you know the avenues in which to to release it where we're so where do you live
right now philadelphia oh you live in philly right now and joe's still there yeah he's still there
wow dude i was watching um this morning i was like reminiscing a little bit watching one of the old
cky videos and i watched this scene where you guys were playing poker yeah and dico takes your cross
he's like what did your grandmother give you this and that that was right around that if you
remember that you maybe you couldn't tell but like i was so uncomfortable like i come out of
baltimore i have this big gold like that was yeah i was just so unsure of myself it's just i really
didn't know anything about me and that was you know even filming that because band would like put me
in these skits and like you're drinking wine and a shot glass i was still like in my mind all i wanted
to do was keep doing heroin but i knew that it wasn't like sustainable and i'd burned all these
bridges in baltimore so he was like letting me live with him yeah so although physically i was there
doing what a lot of people would think was really rad shit in my mind mentally all i was obsessing
about was how can i get back to baltimore to get heroin yeah wow dude it's insane looking back but
that's literally where i was at during that scene like i could have given a fuck less about that i
just i wanted to get back to baltimore to get heroin but without any repercussions which was
impossible so i was like in this weird purgatory state and that lasted for the better part of like
a lot of years god damn what was the worst shit you ever saw like on the streets trying to score
smack dude there was just a lot of things that uh that that i wouldn't recommend or suggest anybody
ever have to witness and really what it was is just the pain that our loved ones
received as a direct result right because they get the they get the short end of the stick they
get like the addiction except they get everything that comes with addiction except for the physical
act of drinking or drugging which allows you to escape reality and it's kind of like this yeah okay
they get like the pain the death the destruction the the heartbreak the heartache and that to me
was you know watching my mother like just have to close we had this big glass door and i went
home one day and a common theme in my stories is that locks stop working right like i put the key
in it doesn't work and she's just there crying crying crying and she said brandon i can't i can no
longer allow you to live here i will no longer love you to death you have to go and and i'm like
you're my mother and and and it's so sick but i would take it to like you allow my father to
do this for years if it wasn't for my dad i wouldn't be the way that i was you know i'm really
projecting this evil vile stuff that is not true um and and that's to me the worst
shit now to viewers are like oh wow your mom's crying that's not that sad of a thing i've seen
like the the stabbings i've seen the shootings i've seen like babies and crack houses you know
it's it's just but at that point in time it's just kind of like par for the course it's a
monday morning yeah that's stuff you see every day yeah yeah that's not the stuff that sticks with me
what sticks with me is uh you know my mother literally praying to god that uh that i die
legit just because then she could finally have a piece of mind knowing that i was safe once and
for all she told you that yeah she bought me a plot i have a plot waiting legit which is for sale
now so if anyone out here would like to purchase this plot which is in baltimore the the the proceeds
from said plot will go to the scholarship foundation that i've created which provides uh sober living
for any man in need i refuse to let price be a deterrent as to why someone can't follow through
with sobriety after completing an inpatient program wow but yeah like god that's fucking
dark that's where it went for me fuck most fucked up thing i've ever heard on here and to me that's
just like pretty is like yeah it's like yeah have you ever have you ever watched that youtube channel
soft white underbelly i've heard dude never watch it's this dude mark later who's a photographer
lives on in la but he bought a studio a photo studio in skid row and then he was just constantly
surrounded by all these pimps and prostitutes and crack heads and like the most fucked up human
beings on earth one dude had like half of his face blown off by a shotgun over like a crack deal
gone wrong and like he just started bringing them into his studio and talking to them and like asking
them about their lives and it is it is gut wrenching to watch some of those interviews bro i mean and
he says like the number one i don't know if it's true for like you or the people that you around
but he says out of all the people he interviewed the number one common denominator is like
fucked up childhoods and like fucked up parenting i mean well that's the thing right like the the
byproduct the thing that gets our attention is the the skid row drug addict crackhead that's
but if you look beyond that you know past the thing that we're seeing the solution to the real
problem there's there's some kind of traumatic experience that took place within that individual's
life right and that's what's so important with with getting i'm a big fan of treatment um
you know i don't trust anyone that doesn't seek outside advice or counsel through some form of
therapy personally um and i'm a big fan of of of helping someone find an appropriate program that
fits their their diagnosis because what happens is then say you know that bottle of wine is my
my addiction right and you i put it down if i just simply sit this thing down
and that's all i've done it's not a matter of if i pick it back up but when i will pick it back up
why because that's not the problem that's the solution the same alcoholic will drink again
why wouldn't i just pick that back up so if i can get someone into an appropriate program
and create a big enough gap between me and the last time i've picked up my solution then we can
get to the root of the cause we can uncover what the problem is in order to discover what the problem
is if there's any hopes to recover from the problem because a lot of times people even fucking know
what the problem is it's never been uncovered right right it's so buried yeah so ignorance is
bliss why wouldn't i fucking smoke crack on skid row and have half my face blown off like what what
no fool is you for thinking that there's something wrong with my story right straight up yeah man
like that's the disconnection from reality is is mind blowing yeah i like to what your quote was
you said uh i forget i think it was on birds podcast you said uh i'm a big fan of hard times
yeah totally i you know there has to be some repercussions from the actions right yeah i was
always i was very grateful to have been surrounded by really good people in my new way of life that
i'm on and journey and they would instill these things in me like you never get between an alcoholic
in their bottom right and and uh there has to be some repercussions from their actions or else why
would i stop right why yeah why me personally but that's the fucked up convoluted thing about
alcoholism and addiction is it's it's which is why it looks like we're fighting this really
unwinning battle if you look at the analytics if you look at the statistics the cold hard
fucking data collected from whatever they're you know pooling this from it states that i a person
in recovery and or an addict an alcoholic should be high or dead right now the fact that i'm not as
a miraculous equally a miracle and be it defies logic um it looks like we are fighting an unwinning
battle but if you ask my mother she'll tell you different because like i'm not in that plot that
she bought me years ago so i work with the dea now which is pretty fucking insane wow the dea came
to me i didn't go to the dea the dea came to me and they said look no back we understand that we
cannot a west we understand that we cannot arrest our way out of this problem anymore right um
but wow took him long enough right yeah where you've been man
and uh just say no thing didn't work shocker but um they said we understand that we can no
longer recognize you know arrest our way out of this problem we are going to create this thing called
the opioid summit the 360 degree opioid summit and we're going to have it in every state the dea is
the dea but under that umbrella are all these different factions of the dea it's like the va
right the va is the va but then you have all these other va's in different states and they're all
kind of ran differently they're not under the same guidelines or and uh the dea is very similar so
what they did was they brought me on to be this uh the speaker the keynote speaker for these uh
events that they throw because they want to try to you know instill change in the approach
that they're headed in with addiction and in the crisis that we're in so they interviewed
pablo eskibar and they were telling me about this they said we went to pablo and they said um
um how do we stop the supply how do we stop the supply and pablo looked at them a real matter
of fact nonchalant didn't even blink his eyes he said you stop the supply by stopping the demand
right so simple so simple that most miss that what i can tell you is me being a person who's
coming up on nine years sober i literally spent the majority of every living breath in my body
coming up with ways to to find as much money to consume as much heroin into my arm as possible
for a lot of years and the fact that i'm no longer living that way just me as one human in the
7.3 billion people in the world i've stopped just myself uh a lot of the demand just me right so
when someone took the time to help me what happened was i accepted the help now i help another
two turn into four four turn into eight eight turn into 16 and before you know it the narrative
is changing meaning that the outcome is changing so that's the approach that uh
you know but if you look at the numbers we're losing this battle yeah well i mean doesn't
i don't believe it isn't the pharmaceutical industry one of the biggest problems with this too
it's so disgusting i mean we're the only country in the world besides we're not even half as bad as
new Zealand it's new zealand but they're the only other country that allows advertising of pharmaceutical
drugs on television and everywhere else and like even with those recent documentaries that came out
the painkiller documentary and then the purdue pharma all that shit is like that i mean you want
to talk about a cartel uh yeah it's it's insane um i that they are as a complete fact to my belief
they are worse drug dealers than the guys out here on the corner that are just like legit selling
whatever they're selling yeah i don't those those are the the real gangsters yeah but if you could
stop if you could stop those companies being able to make so much goddamn money and skirt so much
regulation and like being literally in lockstep with lobbying fucking politicians to be able to
get away with whatever they want yeah i mean that that seems to me like the lowest hanging fruit
to the problem so i well yeah but it's just so complex so so convoluted so layered
that my feeble mind doesn't see a solution to that but what i can wrap my head around what i
can conceive is like helping another individual to turn into four four turn eight eight turn to 16
that the narrative changes because the the demand is stopping the supply is no longer needed the
outcome is fuck like i'm cool i don't even i'm not interested in what you're selling
that's that's my outlook on a grim situation that i can wrap my head around and really believe
things will change over do you do you know anything about um the program they have in
i forget what country it is right now i want to say it's like finland or something
where they actually made heroin legal to where like if you have a problem with heroin like a
doctor will work with you and like titrate down your dose and they'll you can actually go to the
doctor to get your heroin like make sure it's clean and make sure you don't you know get any
infections or whatever and then they slowly work with you and try to wean you off like under medical
supervision i'm a big fan of that approach i know just a little bit not nearly enough to sit here
and act as if i do do you think that would work here here's the deal right in this world of harm
reduction there's no margin for error yet it's impossible to do perfect yeah no one has the
fucking answer right if we did we bottle it we sell it we'd be a billionaire a billion times over
i believe and i want to hope within my heart of hearts that we're we're all coming to this with
the most sincerest of intentions and we want the best outcome i really want to believe that
probably not true but that's what i choose to believe and um we're just doing the best with
what we have and and if we all come together collectively um and continue to not buy into
which could be you know just political propaganda look at this war on drugs that you're fighting
that you're never gonna win yeah you know that just deep in certain party's pockets for sure
right right you know if you don't buy into that narrative and and just stay in this for the right
reason like the right outcome will prevail um i'm a big they were going to open the first
safe injection site in philadelphia um and i don't know where because they have those but like in pa i
think the first one was going to be in the city of philadelphia and it was this close to being passed
and at the midnight hour they pulled it really and uh and some of the arguments were you know
what if my son walks past there and he sees them in there injecting because same thing they were
gonna have doctors in there they were going to have uh people administering uh fentanyl test kits
to see if there's fentanyl a very safe space for which you can inject your drugs give you clean
needles clean cookers clean water clean cottons to bring the you know the the disease uh spreading
to a minimal and they said well what if my son walks past there and he sees that and then also
it could be used as a portal you know to where like if you're in there and you want help here's
all these resources available let's get you from there to treatment right it was going to do all
this great but then their big concern was like well what if my girl what if my son what if my daughter
and my thought to that was the majority of the men and women that are in there doing that don't
want to be in there doing that right like my mother 83 god bless her soul is never going to walk
past the safe injection site and seeing some guy with a needle hanging out his arm like that looks
pretty fucking fun right like that's not how generally that's not how it works right but then
fuck it i'll just say it like being uh an owner of properties i wouldn't want it next to my house
yeah if you're really going to be sincere would you mind you know right but who's this i mean i
would give up my property value in order to save countless people for sure but my very first thought
was like no you don't want to i love it but i love it over there exactly exactly truth be told yeah
so it's like yeah what what you don't see doesn't affect you right yeah but again i just uh i believe
in miracles because i am a walking talking miracle and i know a lot of real life miracles
that are amongst us all day and night um so i'll continue to fight this what a lot of others would
say unwinning battle yeah what what do you think about like all the fentanyl and shit being trafficked
over here and mixed with everything like in cocaine so that's insane too i had a big talk with the da i
just did an event with them the da and i asked them about that and they talked to me they said
cocaine is making a very big comeback not crack but cocaine they're seeing tons of cocaine again
yeah methamphetamine obviously which is kind of known um and they said what happened is because
they banned china from being able to export the the the the ingredients that it takes to make
fentanyl right like they really put a safeguard on on shutting that down as best as they could do
but what's happening now is remember like when they were making the backyard meth like in a
bathroom in a little like soda bottle can they're doing the same thing here with fentanyl doing
that and they gave me this chocolate chip analogy because you have these guys in in the woods with
a home depot bucket and a two by four mixing up fentanyl like for real um and then they're putting
it into whatever product they're cooking up it's turning into this uh imagine you're baking a batch
of chocolate chip cookies do you have the ability to control how many chocolate chips go in each
designed cookie no same thing with fentanyl so that's why you get a batch where one you buy from
the same dealer one person might totally be fine but the other person dies immediately it's that
whole chocolate chip right right cookie thing yeah so yeah so so they're doing that so that they
understand um so what they're doing now and you'll start to hear this if you pay attention they're
going to start changing the the the narrative and the wording of it uh you're not going to hear
overdoses anymore you're going to start to hear poisonings because i said well why are they putting
it in cocaine why are they putting in right xanax why are they putting it in ecstasy and they said

nothing more i love than shooting up heroin and cocaine at the same time right yeah how do you
do a speedball you just heroin and cocaine mixed up cook it up and shoot it together in one shot
but it gives you real high and you just get this sensation this smell this feeling and
then it brings you like you just stopping your tracks um but it kind of produces that same effect
within these kids who are going to buy a little bit of blow right or whatever it gives you that
without even knowing that you're going to get that in hopes to create this new phenomenon um and just
to help spike sales really is what they're doing it for so i did quicker i always thought that the
fentanyl in the cocaine because these people that are doing it are dying instantly i know
so i always thought that i had i read something about this where people that all are dying because
the chocolate chip effect right so there's so many things aren't dying yeah and you can't control that
so i thought it was like shitty street dealers who sold heroin that you can you mix heroin with
fentanyl on purpose right like because it's a it's a whatever but they're mixing it on the same table
or whatever as they're mixing the cocaine so they're accidentally getting some like no some
side residue of some fentanyl in there yeah but you think they're intentionally putting in there
that's that's that's what i was told okay by the dea right people and it's not remember the dea
is like a very big facet it's a big organization so it's not like they have a speaker that speaks
for them i just talked to some people that are employed by them but if i'm selling coke and
i'm mixing the fentanyl and it's killing people that's not good for business right
you want your clients to die true but then the ones that don't die are like ah what's this that's
like extra good okay you know what i mean like that's different i like that high yeah they go back
to that person can you steven there's an article i don't know if you can find it but there was a
recent article where the like the boss of the sinoloa cartel those are the two main cartels
that are fighting over everything this is also what they told me it's the sinoloa and the c jing
which is whoever they are those are the two that are like the the ones that are new generation
cartel everything yes those are the two that are that have the say so and everything so that yeah it
was the boss the sinoloa called cartel made some sort of statement like to all of their proxies that
if anybody find if they find fentanyl in any of their coke that they're gonna like kill them on
site or there'll be there will be like massive repercussions for them so that could very well
have happened i don't know the day-to-day work yeah it was crazy to see that in an article to see
that like the cartels are super against their shit being cut with fentanyl and they're gonna be
punishing people for putting fentanyl for mixing their coke with fentanyl so then the approach to
the prosecution side of this thing again what they're doing is they're changing the verbal
from overdoses to poisoning because if i arrest you because you sold a batch of heroin or cocaine
that killed some people with fentanyl i'm arresting you for you know possession distribution maybe
some form of homicide first second third degree but if i can say that you're poisoning people
the outcome of that sentencing way worse way worse so you're gonna hear less overdosing more
poisoning is how that's going to start playing out do you think you could handle fentanyl you
could handle some no i would have for sure died i mean i literally my day consisted of me coming
up with as much money humanly possible to to stick a needle in tomorrow and then just i mean i did
that like this is one of my tattoos where's my needle i know i saw there it is like that's what
i did like i really did that thing and i'm not bragging by any means but that was that was how
i got there it is what does the top say go scroll down up a little bit mexico sent a little cartel
say gang has purportedly sworn off sales of fentanyl yeah banners appear mondale wow prosecutors
in sent a little confirmed that the banners appeared on over overpasses and near roadways
but could not say whether they were authentic or who had hung them up yeah or is that just a tactical
play to say we're not doing it leave us alone a little bit yeah that can easily be that it's
like very similar as politics right there yeah who put it out like that stuff yeah what side
was basically a political party in mexico it is it's like we'll put that in my head or fox which
which narrative are we pushing out here it's like you just never know um yeah it's a it's a very
difficult uncharted terry a territory what was the story with you guys i don't know if you're
with bam but you were telling a story about like some simoan tranny some simoan trans dude
in a hotel room yeah yeah yeah i was on the howard stern show and uh you know i'd been up for several
days doing cocaine and and the howard stern show was done in new york at the time and um
it happens very early like five eight yeah the studio and of course the logical approach
to being there five in the morning is just to stay up and do coke all night right don't go to sleep
totally so i did that we go in and and the show came out amazing it did really well like insanely
high ratings um and the ratings were like great and um i talked on there about wanting to get
blown by a transsexual because i was like you know it seemed like a great idea it seemed like you know
everything would be amazing about it that's probably what they do the majority of their
experiences you know when they're portraying a woman is just giving lots of blowjobs they'd be
great at it whatever they'd be they'd be better at giving blowjobs i think they'd be you know more
in tune with it right because they understand what it takes to get a good blow job and you know
they're they're men it doesn't you know disguising themselves as women right so obviously they're
not going to fuck a lot so i'd imagine they're go to a b world this is my guess and uh so we're in
australia and we're doing a fuckface tour and one of the promoters asked if we needed anything and
that was another tour that i got kicked off of just being way too high and buying oxy
cottons and i got caught with them but nonetheless bam's like yes we need a transsexual that's
willing to put a friend over and we get back to the hotel and lo and behold there's a knock at the
door and there's this transsexual and uh the transsexual's pimp and in my mind what i envisioned
a transsexual to look like was this very attractive woman that you know remember that morrie show the
talk show is it a man or is it a woman remember that talk show like how is there like a jerry
springer like really good-looking men that look like women and in my mind that's what it was going
to be if it never came before you wouldn't even be able to tell it so yeah i got you'd be jealous
for not partaking in my mind is how this was going to look if it ever happened yeah totally
and lo and behold it happened and it did not play out at all like i predicted it would the
the transsexual was just like this like Samoan guy that didn't really look like a girl and look like
he played like a linebacker for a football team and there was like a pimp there and and it was
just really weird and i had been on cocaine for like days and i'm like paranoid and delusional at
this point and i used to watch that tv show cops a lot and and i love when they would do the prostitution
stings they get a hotel room next an adjoining room next door yeah and then the john would come in
with the chick and then all of a sudden the police would barge through the door yeah and i'm like
fuck this is gonna happen this before that everyone went into the bathroom the pimp included
everyone from the party because i was there yeah he had to go to everyone had to go to the bathroom
because i was engaged at the time and i didn't want word to get back to my fiance that i'm getting
blown by a not only a hooker but like a transsexual so uh everyone's in the bathroom so no one can
see or take pictures and wait why what was in it for why did you agree to do it just because
well because i was on the Howard Stern show and that's a good goddamn story to tell oh that i would
love to do that you know just like and at the time i was like yeah whatever sure it'd be rad but
basically my mouth throw to my my my mouth throw to check my ass did not want to cash yeah is what
it came down to yourself indeed yeah you know you're just consumed by the moment the energy like
i'll do it you're like no didn't want to be a coward i i walked way too far to get out of this one
and uh so everyone's in the bathroom and and and i'm like delusional i'm starting to become paranoid
haven't slept for almost five days and i'm believing i sit on a chair and and she sits on a chair and
and i don't know what to say or do and i'm like if you're a cop just arrest me now because i'm
envisioning like the doors and the police yeah she's i'm not a cop she's let's go to the bed and
i'm like well why would we go to the bed there's nothing to do in the bed like no no and then he
she kind of starts to crawl over and perform the acts but i like to talk dirty like when in that
position and and that's not really my mind can't get there and i just want this i just wanted over
with so bad so so bad oh somehow how long it didn't take long really i i pulled it together man
i pulled it together i've been in uncomfortable situations before so it's not like the fur and
i've had uh during addiction you know men blow me for money before right but that was by force this
is almost by choice in a weird roundabout way friends in the bathroom and the pimp this big pimp
guy in the bathroom it's just i'm gonna blow i mean australia oh my god so the deed is done
they come out and then to make matters worse when they're leaving the hotel room one of them swipe
bam had this big platinum heartogram necklace that this jeweler like made and gifted him like
really expensive platinum and they swipe that too so this whole thing caused probably like
it was like at least 20 grand but just adding the cost of the necklace
yeah so the moral of the story is do not get blown by a tranny in australia
no they don't look like what you think they were everyone has a king man that's someone's
not mine oh god but you were you were a veteran at that point though you knew
kind of like how like is there a process for you to like get yourself out of your head when
that's happening like i just need this guy to blow me so i can get some heroin like it's it's
gonna be over yeah five minutes it is it's it's just kind of like you know i you disconnect
you know i disassociate like really you know i've i've spent you know i've i've been in solitary
confinement where i was locked in a cell for 23 hours a day loud out once an hour one time a day
for an hour monday through friday and handcuffs and shackles and you know i've i've done that i've
been homeless i've slept in abandoned houses i've had to like piss and shit into like one of those
home depot buckets i've done the prostitution thing i've i've completely destroyed you know
my mother's hopes and dreams to have a safe child um yeah i've been around the block a lot of times
so i'm pretty good at like thank god i'm not like that now i don't have to disassociate from anything
and i actually really appreciate and and i'm grateful for the process in which like things
take place and um and i'm so much in that zone now that like when the littlest of thing like gets
me off my game like i almost like shake physically like i can tell like i'm just so disconnected
from being that guy that i once was that like you know i i'm just such a changed man wow dude
wait whatever happened to um dico he's around i don't know he like he like disappeared everyone
like wonder there's everyone speculates where he went but he just like fell off from disappeared
into the darkness yeah he was the one that i was the least closest to oh was he really yeah he was
he was literally the one i was the least closest with huh do you and bam still talk now or you guys
still kind of on the outs uh we're not speaking at the moment i i don't have any issues i've never
been angry or you know i had an issue with him i will always love him to death i'll always be there
for him um i think we were just going in two different directions for a while so we didn't
have much in common you know um but i see like the you were like on the rise and he was kind of
like spiraling out of control yeah we were just we were just headed in two different directions
you know and i don't ever come from a place of like standing on the top of this mountain preaching
as if i have the answers because i actually i i don't i don't have any answers at all what i
know is this my narrative and and where i'm at in the direction i'm headed in and and if if anyone
out there wants to be a part of it then write on let's do this together and maybe if there's
more similarities than differences it might make sense to to pay a little bit of attention
but if not that's totally okay so i don't know if his direction was the right or wrong one uh who
am i to say that i just know it wasn't the direction that i was headed in and looking back for me
depending on how deep you want to dive or go down that hole if anyone anyone anyone anyone
would have robbed me of my process like allow me to spend one less night homeless allow me to spend
one less night in a cell or in a really bad position or predicament odds are i would not be
the man that i am today who is literally a child of god who devotes my life to helping people who
are where i once was right so like again because all i did was just had a series of me knowing
now that i was being divinely inconvenienced over and over and over until i could like recognize it
and say okay like here we go this is it so i i don't know if i believe we're all exactly
where we're supposed to be right i genuinely believe that my heart of hearts so you cut him
off right uh this last time i didn't cut him off i just we just i just choose was chose not to
communicate with him um because he was just in a place where i wasn't and he was uh you know he was
uh he was just saying a lot of hurtful things yeah so i answer shit yeah so i was like that's
just not where i'm at and it's i'm an empath and i take on people's energy and that was a very very
someone i love who's who you know i literally devote and and you know i i i thank him for
giving me the offer an opportunity to get out of baltimore if i stayed i would have been in
that plot that my mother bought me for sure so you know i'm forever indebted to him and it was
really tough to see someone who i love and who had helped save my life countless times then battle
with his own demons um so i i've always been there i'll continue to be there and and uh
i would love to skate with him now he looks like he's skating and having a blast and i hope that
that happens sooner rather than later skateboarding is the the glue between all of yeah our relationships
and just in general yeah and just for like from an outsider's perspective it's just like crazy to see
two best friends like not at least in a public setting like publicly being mad at each other
not talking to each other and it's just like from our perspective it's like sad you know for sure
and i i i would have no problem i got there's nothing more i'd love than to connect with him
but it just hasn't happened yet yeah you know it'll it'll happen eventually when it's supposed to
and timing and alignment is everything don't force it right yeah yeah literally you know the world
works so much better when i just kind of stay out of it and just go along with the process that's
being kind of pushed in my direction yeah when i try to interject because i believe i know what's
best i fucking fail straight up so i just remain teachable i remain humble i remain open minded
i remain willing good bad or indifferent every morning i start my day with thanking god for
everything i've been given everything that's been taken and everything that's in store for me
and i mean that until like 10 o'clock yeah i gotta like recalibrate re-center readjust
reevaluate reassess right but the beautiful thing is i have this awareness now ignorance is no
longer bliss i've i've been um you know given this information which now means i'm to be held
accountable for my actions and i choose to understand as opposed to being understood
um that's it yeah it's a rather it's so simple that for me i missed it for so long until again
not to fucking be a weird asshole but until i like took the short bus to school right right
until i just admitted that what i know is i don't know and the moment i admitted complete defeat was
the second i secured the ultimate victory it's so fucking contradictory to the way i live my life
prior to yeah it's the exact opposite of everything right yeah what's that that famous quote the uh
hard hard times make strong men strong men make good times good times make weak men yeah well i
i was small because mine is a hard head makes for a soft ass and i promised you my ass to
solve this in this room i just bumped it over and over and over oh my god dude
so how so how does your business work where you bought a bunch of houses in baltimore
wilmington delaware in wilmington delaware okay so how does that whole thing work well it's not
even like again i didn't i i i i i kicked out of high school in the 11th grade as a direct result
of my addiction i got my g ed in the penitentiary i didn't go to like real estate school i didn't
i told you what i walked into treatment with um
but somehow i promised myself because of what my mentors told me in the beginning they said if you
stick to the basics you'll never have to go back to the basics and they said if you if you want
what you have you have to give it away all right if you want if you want what we have
do what we do and you can get what we got all right they said all these weird things that like
we're like mind fucks and riddles and i didn't understand them until i understood them
but i promised that so i went to an inpatient treatment center for 90 days and from that
inpatient treatment center i went to a sober living house where i live for one year and the
reason why i did that was not because it was my idea it was because my my sponsor who had 19
years sober at the time suggested that i do that because he did that didn't take a genius to figure
out if i recreate what he did in the past i could get what he has today so i followed suit and i went
to the sober living house for a year and and that sober living house like did for me what no other
program had ever really done because i could i'm institutionalized i i can i can fall in line i can
conform really easy i can go to a jail and do a sentence i can go to a treatment center and think
make you think i'm like running the place i can run the groups i can repeat the rhetoric like i do
that right but where the ball was always dropped for me was once i complete it said program or
sentence and i'm just thrust it back into this community of quote unquote normal people and
human beings and because i was so disconnected from reality like i didn't understand how to make
that transition and i'm living in this sober living house after completing my 90 day inpatient
treatment center i'm a big fan of following through with the continuum of care which is why i said
what i do now i'll get into that but uh in this sober living house i now have a job washing dishes
at Marianne's diner i wash dishes for six dollars an hour under the table next to a 14 year old
kid named ryan and i had heard about what humility looked like but i never knew because i never
experienced it that was humility right the successful individual i was prior to finding
recovery i'm now a 38 year old man who has four months sober and i'm working at Marianne's diner
washing dishes for six dollars an hour under the table next to a 14 year old kid like what the
fuck in my mind i should have been at at the at least the president of the united states at the
least bare minimum right like for starters and um literally i know that job literally was was
creating the foundation for not only my sobriety but me as a human being today um and uh
and i was washing dishes i would every night i had a black outfit black button up shirt and black
pants and i would put my clothes in the the washing machine and they would come out bleached and i
didn't know why and i i didn't i was too embarrassed to ask someone what the deal was and one of my
housemates walked past and they saw that i was washing my clothes with dish washing detergent
and they're like what are you doing like i didn't i didn't know you know like that i was really
disconnected from reality yeah but simple things like that were taught to me through the community
from which i lived with of all these sober guys just trying to obtain the same thing another
state sober while assimilating back into this weird thing called the fucking world without
drinking or drucking is like a lot and i stayed in that sober living house for a year and i learned
i i i opened up my my very first own ever bank account just me not one with a chick or someone who
had like a safe like mine and i got a checking account and i got a debit card and then i worked
that up to a pre-secured credit card and i i started paying my own way the 165 a week off of the money
i was making washing dishes and then i started paying bi-weekly right it was no fucking guess
or to anyone's surprise i lack self-esteem and i didn't know how to obtain it or else i would
have done it on my own and not ended up in a 12-step program right again all these things
happened to me unbeknownst to me i'm showing up for work on time i'm becoming self-sufficient
i'm taking pride in washing those dishes i miss one day for a whole year and that's because of a
snowstorm not because i didn't show up because i started taking other people's feelings into
consideration and i was like if i don't go to work who's gonna fucking help brian wash all these
dishes right the behavior started to change and through these behavioral changes that lack of
self-esteem through doing these esteemable acts turned into like this insane amount of self-esteem
right all of a sudden i started doing these esteemable acts and i gained the sense of self-esteem
unbeknownst to me and one day i just started looking at you in your eyes i started speaking
with conviction and believing what i was saying and i recognize how important and significant
this part of my process was fast forward oh my fifth year anniversary my fifth year sober
anniversary i i got back to where i was financially put together and credit score built up off of that
pre-secured credit card you know like i own a property i own my own house and i'm like
me and a guy that i met in that treatment center who's now one of my best friends george we we bought
a house and we opened up novex house and that was one house with 10 beds and uh oh you bought the
first house you bought was for other people like for sober living yeah yeah well my own house i bought
my own house so i was living in my own house oh got you okay and i bought that one on my three
year anniversary i bought my own personal house okay but then on my fifth year we bought one home
named it novex house wilmington delaware one house 10 beds and we just celebrated our three year
anniversary on november fourth and today we have six houses with 65 beds damn it's awesome and i i
didn't go to real estate school i didn't come from this background i just all i did was get the
fuck out of my way i just learned that the common denominator in my problems were me and if i surrounded
myself with like genuinely good-hearted like-minded people i could get to where i'm trying to go with
the assistance from some people that knew about me and um and and now what i do is i just travel
around i'm a motivational speaker and i i raise money to provide a scholarship fund and and the
why behind my whole purpose all these fucked up stories that you heard about is to show you that
like change is possible and that your history does not have to dictate your future but it can
absolutely guide and direct it and now i just raise lots of money to provide a scholarship fund
therefore any man because i only have men's houses upon completing some form of an inpatient program
that want to continue their journey but don't have the finances to do so we will give you a bed
wow dude until you can kind of transition into paying your own bills and becoming
self-sufficient helping me i'm just doing what was done for me yeah right i'm not trying to reinvent
the wheel or solve world hunger here i'm just that's my story and my story produced this outcome so
how dare i how fucking dare i safeguard it and not share it with the world because this is the
beautiful magical thing about recovery in our weird world anywhere in business anywhere in
business if i come up to you and i give you something that i have i am to walk away with less
fact fact fact fact prove me wrong but in my world of recovery if i walk up to you and i give you
something that i have i walk away with more it only makes sense within my world and other people
that live in my world recovering people can attest to it well that's something that's weird
it's like a in great embedded in the human psyche is that when people help each other you never know
it was such a weird thing too right like when you give away shit you get this weird sense of
gratitude or like fulfillment from it right and you would never think that it doesn't really it's
kind of counterintuitive to what people think when you think of like from the perspective of
of scarcity like there's only so many i only have so many of these apples i can only give away i
can't give away any because they're not gonna last me or whatever but when you think of when you
actually do that act of giving away some of the shit you have there's this weird psychological
sense of of fulfillment from it that you would never expect was there and the universe always
prevails yeah and gives you exactly what you need there's a saying within our sober world
that if financially you're going through some issues and you go to a 12-step meeting and they
pass the basket around throw in an extra 20 like that's what's impressed upon you know from my
lineage of mentors like you're financially strapped you're going through these difficulties
financially i want you to throw an extra 20 in the basket like what right yeah that's a tony
robbins thing he always talks about that mm-hmm yeah i don't know much about him you know i know
he could be the next tony i know he is but i just stay in my own lane you get tony robbins run for
his money i i just stay in my own world flying around in my jet helicopter yeah he's a pretty
extreme guy yeah no doubt but then so so then the six houses and and i just i know from where i came
from in the world that i revolve myself in and surround myself in with it i i can create any
environment that i seek i truly believe if i wanted to be a brain surgeon i could be a brain
surgeon i just have to devote the time attention and energy it takes but i can do that so with that
mentality what i've learned again mentality creates reality that's a fact i know that to be true with
my world um i was like dude i could be doing more i could be helping more i could do better help
more in a much more efficient manner so i create it my own treatment center i opened up redemption
addiction treatment center mm-hmm which is um basically like my house is part of the expression
but on meth it's just a bigger like place where we can help more and there's like a psych practice
now i have i have like a psych practitioner that works for me i have a medical director that works
for me wow that's crazy all the dudes that work for you like recovering addicts too i'd say nine
eight out of ten eight out of ten of them yeah yeah yeah and i when i say work for me it sounds so
egotistical and i don't want to frame it in that manner it's just right i'm just saying that a
difference a day can make provided just the right amount of willingness that for me came as a direct
result of pain right right so like anything is possible and you know i always impress upon you
know our my employees our employees however you want to say that sounds so weird saying um that
that the moment that we forget the back for which we've built this organization on
fucking lighted on fire right because the client's care must come first but the moment it becomes
financially driven and incentivized and it's it's not the very first thought is how would the
clients feel about it how would it affect the clients when it's more like uh then it's like
pack it up man yeah pack it up he has not genuine anymore no no our methadone clinic
still a thing uh-huh really i'm a big fan of all that you are because at the very least right the
chip analogy uh matt medicated assistant treatment methadone suboxone subutex vivitron
it's not what i do but who am i to say what the right way to live is fuck i was homeless
almost nine years ago letting men blow me for heroin all the sudden i'm walking on water and i
have the answer to everyone's crisis no man right um truth be told if you think going to the methadone
program every day provides you a life that you believe is worth waking up for and getting
out of bed looking forward to the day i'll fucking drive you and at the very least if you decide that
you want to come off of that one day you'll at least be alive to have the chance to do so
as opposed to just rolling the dice with with fentanyl right what was the problem with the
method and what there was documentaries and shit made about it saying like villain vilifying
i think the problem with it was if i remember correctly there was dudes i know there's a dude
in florida specifically who had like a ton of those methadone clinics here and he also was like
responsible for selling the actual opiates so he was doing but again that's the financially
incentivized right he's making money off yeah which is the problem it's an absolute problem
it is a problem and but and unfortunately and look i'm an abstinent guy i don't partake in
any form of a drink or a drug or a medicated assisted treatment in order to make it through
another day i'm not talking bad on any of these things but you did do methadone though right
you tried it oh tons yeah i love 180 milligrams of methadone and three or four xanax bars
guaranteed overdose every time it didn't cost that much money so it was like a guaranteed overdose
yeah that was a good one um so i'm not far into any of these approaches i just never took it in
the appropriate way i know some people who live a very happy productive life on methadone unfortunately
i know more that don't yeah but who am i to say right well again i i deliver my message in a form
of attraction rather than promotion right so if you out there the viewer the listener uh
uh find what i do appealing enough that you want to be a part of it let's do it yeah if not and the
methadone the clinic looks more appealing right on right give it a go so when you were doing it you
were aiming to overdose oh i was not doing it uh appropriately i wasn't going to a clinic i wasn't
being monitored or given doses i was buying it off the street corner oh okay yeah so i i was always
very scared to get on methadone because it has a really strong shelf life and it's it's it's very
very difficult to come off of you mean like stays in your body yeah oh yeah it's it's it's a gnarly
process but like even doing any drugs you would be aiming to like you would be aiming to go over the
line for sure yeah you're more scared of underdosing than overdosing yeah did i there's nothing more
than angers me than when i see somebody going to the bar and have a glass of wine i want to
smash it over your head what's wrong with you or leave half of it one line and go to bed with the
bag fuck you like you don't deserve to be alive get your ass kicked like get out of it yeah that
i don't get that's what makes me part of that 30 of the world that is not normal who cannot use
without repercussions well that that is more unnormal i think it does have somebody who does
that just has one drink or does one line you're a fucking you're a psycho yeah in my eyes i think in
my eyes too and i'm not even you know i don't have a drug problem or do you maybe i do you think i'm
here for a podcast aka intervention are your bags did you bring his bags yeah exactly jokes on you
oh god dude but that's that's a funny thing though like everybody does coke nowadays everybody
like even young people i know before i even before i even never saw it in real life i have i know
people that are like we're 10 years younger than before i ever saw it today like people in their
early 20s like late teens that are just like they go out and coax like a normal everyday thing it's
like having a bud light wow and i that was at least when i was growing up that it wasn't like that
see i'm so disconnected from that world that like before when i was in it i felt the same way
like oh everyone does it and now it's really rare for me to see people like because i'm just not in
that world you know i don't go to bars i don't associate with people i'm been bed by like nine
no one in my world's doing glow really so i don't it's kind of like you spot it you got it
i don't spot it much anymore right i don't got it yeah like that way interesting yeah i feel like
whenever i'd never go out and but when i do go out on the rare occasion i go to like a nightclub
or a bar it's just like i can see it in the bat it's like everybody's taking turns in the year
we went we went to the strip club a couple weeks ago yeah i'd imagine you see a lot of recreational
cocaine going on there's the guy there's the guy who sits in like when you first walk in he's the
guy that sits there with like the deodorant and all that the mints and everything and then there's
like three stalls and you're waiting in line and you just hear every fucking five seconds in
this year no one's even hiding it anymore there's a line in the bathroom but nobody's at the urinals
yeah just just for the one with the privacy we just got a pee look i hear that in the stall
then i look at the guy sitting there and he's just like it's just normal to me to tell no one cares
yeah yeah i don't i have no problem with people to do but i've just i don't you know kind of show
me who you walk with i'll tell you who you are my mother used to say there's a child all the time
to me and uh i just i don't my social interactions with people are just so different than they used
to be you know i i'm so consumed by like work and and business and and trying to like skate
stuff like i just don't have time that's good for you yeah how often do you skate well it's
funny again after coming this realization later in my life now i try to make it a priority more
and more for my mental health because this thing needs to be quiet sometimes no doubt it's it's
pretty heavy what else do you do for fun i like to work out okay i got oddly great at quitting
things i laugh with you too but i don't smoke anymore i don't eat red meat i only eat chicken
and fish i only drink water i drink hot tea and water you only eat chicken and fish yeah no vegetables
i mean i vegetables i mean meat wise okay gotcha but um i i like to work out i like to skate i like
to ride my bike i like to do my life is really fucking monotone and bland to most i love to go
to the grocery store i love to like have my house clean um like really simple shit and people like
because for years that was not what i was doing like there's nothing normal about the way i lived
for so long right that now like there's dude friday night at nine p.m was a date line special
that i wanted to see and i was so happy i was so excited to like i had just my sweet like
sleep clothes on nine p.m a beautiful fall night like hanging out my cats lit some candles and just
watch this with your cats i'm a cat fanatic i'm like so is he yeah i love cats and he's from
Pittsburgh did i that's why i'm one cat like oh yeah i got a black and white cat i have a one of
them too i took seedling cat i believe i was a cat in my past life oh yeah why i i like to know what's
going on with things but without being in the mix okay yeah i like to pick and choose who i give my
attention to i like to leave when i want to leave um when i am home and not traveling i eat the same
thing every day and uh i keep weird hours sometimes huh very feline ish yeah that's like
legit cats are fucking psychos dude hey there is aren't they aren't they the one animal that just
kills for just kills for fun not for food like i've heard that before i don't know is there any
other animal that just kills shit for fun like lizards and shit i think i don't want to say
they do it for see i'll fucking go to defend them but i think they do it to bring back to their
owner to say like hey look what i've definitely do that yeah oh yeah they bring the mice back
and put it on your door that's true yeah that's true so i don't know if it's a fun thing what other
fucking animal does that um you know the dogs do that i don't think dogs kill really well the ones
the hunting dogs that go yeah right they pick the dead up i don't know what um you know there's have
you like experimented with good drugs like you know there's people out there who are like super
obsessed with like hacking their body and making themselves like stronger and more efficient and
like there's people who like are obsessed with all the the fucking red lights and the saunas
and the cold stuff i do the cold pledges do you and i do the saunas i do that at my facility with
my clients the people go like the same way you and overboard like down the the dark road i don't go
crazy with it i take supplements i'm very mindful i try to because i'll go crazy i'll count carbs i'll
fucking i'll go insane because i'm already insane um so i don't let that dictate what my day or
actions look like i just make a conscious effort to do a little bit better than the day before
so what i try to do is cut out processed foods my food to have like a life to where if i don't
eat it within a week it goes bad that i can wrap my head around right like okay this should be good
for me grocery store stay around around the edges not the inside aisles where all the fuck oh that's
a great point yeah i never yeah all the in yeah i stay on the on the edges where all the produce
and the meat that's where i stay yeah but i never i've never heard that cereals in the middle dang i
don't eat cereal i ate cereal my hotel this morning but i i don't eat that cereal so fucking
bad for you i eat i eat oatmeal every day do you really at home i saw this meme once like if
someone eats oatmeal for breakfast stay away from them yeah because it's like nothing's appealing
about oatmeal i've tried eating oatmeal for breakfast it doesn't do anything for me people
say it's good but like i don't know i've also seen documentaries about like the glyphosate and
shit and all the shit that's sprayed on the oatmeal and they process it it can't be bad but
but it could be worse you know you could be eating a box of twinkies for breakfast right so it's like
fuck yeah that's like the heroin you're asking me i'll justify anything as long as i'm sticking
a needle in my neck straight up like i was king of justifying any behaviors yeah i'm the wrong
one to ask but i saw that and i asked my i have a psychiatrist friend this dr yee it's an insanely
intelligent asian guy friend of mine and uh he created supplements he puts my whole supplement
thing in track and and i'm like dude i because i eat it every i eat one pack of steel cut oatmeal
and i put in organic blackberries and blueberries at it every day oh nice and uh i'm like what's the
deal i got all nervous because i've ate that for like four years and he's like dude don't get caught
up on the hype he's like if you feel better or good upon eating it then just follow suit like
don't because it's like who's pushing that narrative is it is it the right wing or the left
wing right right who's gonna financially incentivize off of you why don't you eat red meat i watched
this documentary that definitely was pushing the narrative of vegan or die yes for sure but i did see
some things that i thought were pretty beneficial from not so i gave it a go i don't know i stopped
smoking i stopped get all kinds of nicotine none at all dude i just picked up this habit oh man
have you seen these my nephew doesn't really apparently they're nice so i had a doctor and i
didn't i didn't i thought they were bad right i figured this is probably just as bad as vaping
but then i had this neuro fucking surgeon in here and he was doing them this guy from tokyo
no less and he comes in with one of these all in fucking japanese writing and i'm like will you do
these wow and he's like yeah he's like they're neuro protective it's good for your brain that's
just addictive which is very well maybe i'm like what's wrong with being addicted to something
that's good for you i agree but i think there are some there's probably some shit that's bad for
you it's probably not good for your heart i'm sure i i just yeah i have enough things to deal
with i don't need to take on a new one right yeah of course yeah but yeah i got i quit um i quit
watching porn i've quit masturbating what quit masturbating all together yeah yeah i've uh
almost two years wow i don't i don't abstain from you never jack off but i just don't jerk off
damn i got into the whole like spiritual quest with the longest you've gone without jacking
off or banging a woman uh well not long i still have sex right i just don't jerk off or watch porn
unless it's with a woman and watching porn right right but uh probably like a week a week yeah i'd
say wow man good for you when i was incarcerated and there was no uh way that i could have human
contact with a woman it was much longer but i was jerking off in there so yeah yeah i don't think i
could ever do that i have sex and i go to the bathroom and jack off right after this really
that's i'm not that guy i'm like a once a day is more than enough for me that's gnarly yeah that's
a weird thing i don't know what i don't know what it's about hey when i dig into that
you have time the more sex i have the more i want to jack off see you you're coming is the
by-product of something much deeper that's your poison let's get to the root of the cause here
there's something to do yeah Romeo oh fuck dude speaking of that i'm trying to fill some void
who knows where it is i have um can any of you guys guess what that is
the white thing but yeah the looks like an ayahuasca root okay is that what it is a wave a
water wave water wave ayahuasca a cum stain fucking a so yes it's cum stain and here's how that
came about again cocaine is a direct result of a lot of bad decisions well cocaine for multiple
days at bam's house shooting a game of castle yeah shooting a game of pool at five a.m. one morning
it's so fucked up i win the game of pool we've been awake for days i win the game of pool five a.m
i win the game of pool we have a tattoo artist with us we go into the bedroom
i lay on the bed he puts a pillow over my head he pulls a laptop out he jerks off
and comes onto my arm and then we had the tattoo artist trace it and then go over it and put the
cum in so i've had his cum inside me without him actually fucking me which is also another magical
trick and then tattooed it in the tattooed it yeah oh fuck that's gnarly so there's a whole thing
there if you want to unpack that too i don't know that's gonna be a clip um Jesus yeah and i won the
game of pool it's so wrong that it's fucking right wow none of that makes sense anywhere in the world
but it makes sense
and see i just yeah that was just like all right we're probably getting ready to rap
and i just you start talking about cum and then i go there you know like there's a lot of things
like that i just for that those were just days of that's just like a monday morning i used to bet
at uh people if they could guess it i give them a hundred bucks and one time we're at the airport
and uh drinking a glass of wine and i'm talking to the guy who serves it and he's just this flamboyantly
gay guy he's an amazing guy and i'm like if you guess what this is i'll give you a hundred bucks
and he's like sweetheart that's cum and i'm like god damn it i knew my glass of wine was eight
bucks and i had to tip a hundred on top of it i'm like never fucking again wow that's fucking wild
bro well you got to catch a flight dude it's three o'clock this was um this was illuminated
amazingly entertaining yeah it's very interesting i i could sit here and do this for hours dude
yeah man this was fun thanks again for doing it yeah come visit us when you're telling me
i would love to i don't really have to make it over here much this side but this was this was
i really enjoyed it you got you said you have house in lauderdale yeah yeah i did but then i was
opening my new facility redemption addiction treatment center so anyone out there if anyone
needs help and anyone out there is struggling with addiction or alcoholism call me directly
610-314-6747 and we'll do the best that we can to get you the help that you deserve
if you could add that that i'll put the phone number like in the district is there like a link
or anything yeah redemption addiction treatment center yeah i'll link all your shit that'd be
rad but um i had a place in for lauderdale and then i was so consumed with opening that that was
always my dream my end game i always wanted to open a treatment center i wanted to be a part of
people's daily process like from when you walk in the door to when you leave i want to see like
the lights come on i want to see you start to have some ambition and drive and and like start to really
like have a reason to wake up and look forward to the day and families coming back into lives and
and i knew the best way i could do that paired with the fact that i fucking cannot being
i can't stand being told no right i can't stand when someone says oh we can't give this person
a scholarship because they don't have insurance or so like fuck this no it was not exceptional
right like failure is not an option i i opened up my own treatment center and now no one can
tell me no and i help help help um so i i did that and i see like these beautiful lives coming
back together and and it's i don't even know why i got into that tangent it's beautiful man yeah
i love them but that was the end game to to where we're at now oh so while doing that i was so
consumed with that process that i wasn't utilizing my place at fort lauderdale so i put it oh i got
rid of the place everything's in storage so i'd say within the next year i'll start looking for
another little rental property to get you think you'd ever move to florida uh be honest i think
when i get older really yeah just when like not now i love the seasons too much i really appreciate
there's no season here yeah it's just hot and i'm like an accessories whore i like layers i like hot
tea yeah oh yeah you like scarves right yeah i'm not even a big fan of summer yeah i love fall
but yet i had a place here so who the fuck knows yeah can't call it um people from people from up
there are so much different than from people that down here bro like oh yeah people up there have so
much in general they have so much more character than people down here they're kind of like if down
here you kind of i mean there's a lot of old people but people are kind of flat you know up there you
have just like the one what i love about people from like new jersey and new york the most is that
they'll shit on you with a smile you know what i mean my friend was just saying that last night i
was out to dinner and she was telling me that yeah and like they just have so much more charisma up
there i i went to new york recently to see um one of my favorite bands ever is the libertines
pete darty it's a london band uh and they played in new york and i went to it and i'm like it's
such a shame new york is beautiful i love it it's so charismatic it's so eclectic there's so many
different vibes yeah but the people are just not nice yeah that's what i turned me off yeah yeah
but they're not nice but you can be not nice back to them and i'm just kind of funny not that guy now
oh really yeah i'm just i cringe at the thought of confrontation yeah i literally and that comes
from traumatic shit as a child with my father right so that kind of bleeds into like when i'm
off my square just like i don't get angry but i just get really i shake i start shaking but what
do you like better what would you rather have would you rather have people be surrounded by people
in new york that just aren't nice or would you rather be surrounded by people that are like
la and they're just fake nice in order to uh i wouldn't surround myself with either that's the
beautiful thing with sobriety that i have choices and options so and in both those places i would
it's not black and white right now i but if i had to i would probably because i like seasons i would
take new york yeah um but you know california i go often just it depends on what the reasoning
behind it is i i never i don't even like something about i had a place in florida it's something about
the climate too like that changes you when you're in i'm getting older i'm getting older and i'm
like really liking like the easier softer slower way of things going um which i think added to
florida becoming appealing yeah no doubt and then i come here i had everything i set up i had a
place i had clothes and it was like no thought to it just jump on a plane cruise and i have you
know it was nice yeah so i'll do that again i will next year maybe we could do a part two
yeah man that'd be awesome bro what's the documentary coming well i don't know it's above
my pay grade where's fawns yeah that's that's a frowns a question people are asking you got some
fucking editing to do buddy dude yeah that's awesome it's it's amazing though it's a beautiful thing
cool bro well thanks again everybody boys you know what it is links are in the description
